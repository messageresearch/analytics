[14:43] good shape then so let's go to Leviticus
[14:45] 22 3 or 23 2 again I just want to
[14:47] reestablish for the people might be
[14:49] looking in and hear that these seven
[14:51] feasts were not Israel's feasts they're
[14:54] the Lord's feasts okay that's what I
[14:56] want to just re redo it the scripture
[14:58] Leviticus 22 3 2 speaking of the
[15:01] children of Israel and saying to them
[15:03] concerning the feasts of the Lord which
[15:06] ye shall Proclaim you've got to preach
[15:08] these you understand to be holy holy
[15:11] Gatherings even these are my feasts
[15:14] these are the feasts of the Lord even
[15:16] holy Gatherings convocations which ye
[15:19] shall preach in their season right
[15:22] remember Brotherhood said you had to be
[15:24] spiritual food in due season
[15:27] I can take I can take over 50 titles of
[15:30] the message from 63 to 65 and place them
[15:33] in these same seven piece right
[15:35] it really Brethren remember the quote
[15:37] once weekly
[15:38] he read in the book of Exodus because
[15:41] brother Graham a lot of what he got was
[15:42] out of the book of Exodus right which in
[15:44] itself Brethren called it a book of
[15:46] redemption is that right so let's bow
[15:48] our heads if you would dear heavenly
[15:49] father we thank you for the reading of
[15:51] the word we thank you that you've
[15:52] revealed these things to us in this hour
[15:54] Lord there's none of us worthy Lord but
[15:57] you made us worthy and we give thanks to
[16:00] you o God be with us in this service
[16:02] give us a revelation there's nothing
[16:04] more important no higher thing even
[16:07] healing the greatest thing you'll know
[16:09] is a Salvation of your soul and how are
[16:11] you saved by grace are you saved through
[16:13] faith through a revelation greatest
[16:16] thing you can give us oh God and we give
[16:18] you thanks for the Revelation o father
[16:20] in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be
[16:23] seated I want to go I told the brother I
[16:25] wanted to go at the bottom of that page
[16:27] six I think it was quoting recognizing
[16:29] your day as message
[16:31] and I I just want to grab the
[16:33] Pentecostal Feast one more time because
[16:35] there was a chart I found out on the
[16:36] internet and this chart everybody heard
[16:39] of Kabbalah which is the mystical part
[16:41] of Judaism and that doesn't scare me
[16:44] things like that do you know you're the
[16:45] mystical body of Jesus Christ
[16:47] so you know when I use the word mystical
[16:49] it doesn't bother me you got to be
[16:52] careful because there's fanaticism do
[16:53] you know there's fanaticism in the
[16:55] message he said the great thing about
[16:57] Luther is he didn't get a fanaticism his
[16:59] day what you got around the message is
[17:01] you got people who are become fanatics
[17:04] they don't have a balance Fanatics don't
[17:06] have a balance do you understand so we
[17:08] need to have a balance in the word in
[17:10] the quotes in our everyday life we need
[17:13] to have balance right so we need to
[17:15] understand let's read this one it says
[17:17] uh my subject this morning is
[17:20] recognizing your day and its message
[17:22] remember that's part of the Pentecostal
[17:24] Feast remember counting the Omer you had
[17:26] to know the day you're on we see from
[17:28] last Sunday's lesson as we talk the
[17:30] Feast of the trumpets and I want to call
[17:32] your attention now the time of Israel in
[17:35] God's timepiece we are dealing today up
[17:38] on a Sunday school lesson that I want
[17:40] you to realize and recognize the times
[17:42] that we're living in
[17:44] so you as part of your Pentecostal
[17:47] experience you need to know what day
[17:49] you're living in you need to know are
[17:51] you 21 steps away from when he rose are
[17:54] you at the 50 you understand so I'm
[17:57] gonna I'm gonna show you by the quote of
[17:59] the message where we're at we're just
[18:01] about to run out as you see and then by
[18:04] this you should know the very hour and
[18:07] time and sign and message that you are
[18:10] to receive
[18:12] look brother man preached what Paul
[18:14] preached but I'm not in the days of Paul
[18:16] right yeah everybody understand exactly
[18:18] Paul polls we have received a token
[18:22] message at this hour and it's the
[18:23] message that was given by the mighty
[18:25] Angel does everybody agree with that
[18:27] like I told them down there the token
[18:29] for irenius day was the message that God
[18:31] gave irenius right and people that fell
[18:34] under that token are under that message
[18:35] they're going to come up at the Rapture
[18:38] because to be able to Exodus out you
[18:40] have to have a token so every day they
[18:43] had a token message it might have been
[18:46] Luther was only part word the judge that
[18:48] that's the part that God gave in that
[18:50] day and they stayed true to Luther's
[18:53] message
[18:54] so they're going to come up do you
[18:56] understand they stayed under their
[18:58] messenger that just didn't apply to this
[19:00] age that applied to every day the people
[19:03] in Israel coming out had to stay under
[19:05] Moses
[19:06] did they yeah they did
[19:08] Paul they had to stay under him in his
[19:10] hour you have to stay under this message
[19:12] in this hour is that right Glory okay
[19:16] let's go to that chart now that's this I
[19:19] went off the internet and I was looking
[19:21] because what they did Israel they went
[19:23] for the Feast of first fruits they were
[19:25] 50 days and then Moses got up on this
[19:28] mountain
[19:29] so they took 49 days you see this right
[19:32] here 49 and when he went up there they
[19:35] put Revelation there now I'm going to
[19:37] explain something you know what he got
[19:38] on that mountain the revelation of all
[19:40] right did he right see we look at the
[19:43] law and we think well that's the law no
[19:45] it was the revelation of the law before
[19:47] that they had no law right did they no
[19:50] they'd have no law did they
[19:52] right so on that 50th day they received
[19:56] they've come to the Apex God's going to
[19:58] give them a reason for taking them out
[20:00] he's going to give them a revelation you
[20:02] see here what this most important thing
[20:04] is for the Jews you see why the law had
[20:06] so much emphasis on them because they
[20:09] fell under the revelation of the law but
[20:11] when the revelation of Grace had come
[20:13] they couldn't come out of that
[20:14] dispensation right right they couldn't
[20:16] turn the corner could they they said we
[20:18] have Moses in our Prophet we have
[20:20] Abraham as our father and Moses had
[20:22] already warned them there's going to be
[20:24] one like an unto me exactly and if you
[20:27] don't hear him you're going to be cut
[20:28] off from among the brethren
[20:30] right
[20:31] everybody agree with that right
[20:34] so Moses went up here and he got the
[20:35] Revelation The Ten Commandments right
[20:37] does everybody agree with that right man
[20:39] on the 50th day now let me show you I'm
[20:41] going to show you and I'm going to move
[20:42] on real quick okay he come down when he
[20:45] come down the preachers had built some
[20:47] golden calves down at the bottom
[20:49] they hadn't even received the Revelation
[20:51] yet right without the Revelation they're
[20:53] down here building the calf
[20:55] of gold
[20:58] and they got the people dancing naked
[21:00] around it remember I told you this
[21:02] morning they stripped the preachers
[21:03] stripped them off right
[21:05] they didn't have a revelation you don't
[21:07] have a revelation you're naked
[21:09] you'll be dancing around a calf you
[21:11] understand what I'm saying just pure and
[21:13] simple he comes down off the mountain he
[21:15] hears some noise at the bottom of the
[21:17] mountain what's going on they've made a
[21:19] golden calf Moses got so mad he threw
[21:22] down the law and broke it
[21:24] before he could give the Revelation he
[21:26] got the Revelation but he got so mad he
[21:28] broke it is that right
[21:30] so Moses what he did was
[21:33] Moses said he told the people he said
[21:36] you know what I will atone for you
[21:39] yeah you know it really struck me when I
[21:40] was reading through Exodus that bro that
[21:42] stood out Moses said I will atone right
[21:45] Moses didn't say he's going to offer a
[21:47] bull a goat or nothing and he didn't go
[21:49] read it Moses said I will atone for you
[21:51] no wonder Moses said there will be a
[21:53] prophet like unto me that'll atone for
[21:56] you right does everybody see what I'm
[21:57] saying so what happened was
[22:00] after that some days later he went up on
[22:04] a mount God went up there and Moses said
[22:06] he stood in the breach did he not or God
[22:08] would have destroyed him did Jesus stand
[22:10] in a breach amen or God would have
[22:13] destroyed him is that right and he says
[22:15] I will provide an attack I will atone
[22:17] for you Moses went up and pleaded before
[22:20] God God said get away Moses I'm going to
[22:23] destroy the whole lot down there he said
[22:25] you can't take me if you're going to
[22:27] destroy them take me right right and
[22:30] brother had said I couldn't understand
[22:32] how a man could stand in the face of God
[22:34] have enough boldness is a Christ in him
[22:37] by the way and say I will atone for him
[22:40] that's I thought that was big when I
[22:43] read it right I will atone he didn't say
[22:46] a bull ago he said I will
[22:48] do you agree with that amen so the Lord
[22:50] said okay go down off the mountain I'm
[22:53] going to direct you to another Mountain
[22:55] everybody understand what I'm saying
[22:57] and that that amount was signing eye
[22:59] right man he said I'm going to direct
[23:01] you to another Mount which is Mount
[23:03] Horeb so they took another Journey over
[23:05] to there Moses went back on the mountain
[23:08] again he was given the law again does
[23:11] everybody understand that when he went
[23:13] on the mountain you know what the Lord
[23:14] told him I forgive them yeah
[23:18] so the atonement that second Mountain he
[23:20] went on was atonement
[23:22] so you have what look remember the the
[23:24] feast days is it was Feast of Weeks you
[23:27] got feast and after after he come down
[23:29] off the mountain when he went back up
[23:30] and said I will atone God started
[23:32] pouring plagues down one bottom of the
[23:34] mountain did he not what did Brother
[23:35] Adam say the seven feasts were
[23:38] plagues right right what were the
[23:40] plagues to do Drive Israel back to their
[23:42] Homeland
[23:43] after they refused they got into their
[23:47] troubled at the bottom of the mountain
[23:48] he broke the law the next thing Moses
[23:51] went up here to tone for him now God
[23:52] didn't accept him yet
[23:55] until he got on the other Mountain
[23:57] and he started plaguing Israel so I say
[23:59] you had to Feast the Pentecost where he
[24:01] went up to get the Revelation which they
[24:04] goofed up before he came down God starts
[24:06] sending plagues on him does everybody
[24:07] agree with that
[24:09] then he goes into the atonement a few
[24:11] days later when on the mountain does
[24:14] everybody understand that and he said
[24:16] you know what okay I'll I'm gonna go
[24:18] look at it he said I'm a God it's
[24:20] merciful to the fourth generation he
[24:23] goes on and says how merciful he is
[24:25] is that right so what he did he came to
[24:29] atonement
[24:30] does everybody agree with that
[24:33] so he came to atonement he came back
[24:35] down the mountain and gave the people
[24:36] the tablets
[24:38] right
[24:38] so the atonement was when God accepted
[24:41] you right
[24:43] it's not good enough that you have but
[24:45] justification saying you've got to have
[24:47] the atonement the atonement is when God
[24:49] accepts your sacrifice
[24:52] and Moses was put himself a Living
[24:55] Sacrifice I believe that's where Paul
[24:56] got it I believe Paul which the Old
[24:58] Testament and said what in the world he
[25:01] said he didn't offer a bull or goat he
[25:03] offered a Living Sacrifice
[25:05] Moses offered himself that's pretty you
[25:08] think that ain't strong right right but
[25:10] go look I want you I don't have time to
[25:12] read it I broke it down for our church
[25:13] and went all through it but he I I'm
[25:16] still amazed at that I see why brother
[25:18] man said I'm amazed that Moses could
[25:20] stand in the face of God and then tell
[25:22] the people I will atone for you all
[25:24] right that's that's big isn't it
[25:27] that's what happened do you agree so
[25:29] they had to Feast the Pentecost then
[25:31] they had plagues and the plagues drove
[25:33] them to Mount Horeb right now come on go
[25:36] read it it's exactly what I'm saying in
[25:38] the Bible okay and the feast days are
[25:41] the same let's go to the next let's go
[25:43] where we're starting on uh but I just
[25:46] wanted to bring you that chart now we're
[25:47] going to hit the Feast of atonement this
[25:49] is a little chart I put together and
[25:50] we'll come back to it maybe to sum it up
[25:52] if not it'll be on the internet go look
[25:53] at it it'll do you good okay so get it
[25:56] past this let's go to the first quote
[25:58] here we go speaking of the children of
[26:00] Israel saying in the seventh month in
[26:02] the first day of the month so you have a
[26:04] Sabbath a memorial the blowing of
[26:06] trumpets now I'm going to tell you
[26:07] something there's no scripture other
[26:10] than one scripture an entire Bible you
[26:12] can say it's seven trumpets
[26:14] if you go look at the Feast of trumpets
[26:16] as a chauffeur
[26:17] did everybody know that the Ram's Horn
[26:19] right right
[26:21] well the Feast of trumpets they blew a
[26:22] Ram's Horn
[26:24] but brother Brandon comes down in the
[26:25] Book of Revelation says it was seven
[26:27] trumpets
[26:29] there's only one place in the scripture
[26:31] and it's in Revelations that Associates
[26:34] the Feast of trumpets with seven
[26:35] trumpets
[26:37] only one and the scripture don't tie it
[26:40] back to it brother Branham does yeah
[26:42] that's why you've got to have a prophet
[26:44] or you'll never you'll never be able to
[26:46] get this
[26:47] a prophet is a Divine interpreter of the
[26:51] word right
[26:52] you think you can make it without this
[26:54] Prophet you're kidding yourself
[26:56] amen you have to receive a God will
[26:58] reveal
[26:59] if he's going to reveal a secret thing
[27:01] he was three he'll reveal it unto his
[27:03] servant the prophets
[27:04] come on is that right brother is the
[27:07] only one ever anywhere go to the
[27:10] anywhere that ties the Feast of seven
[27:12] the Feast of trumpets to seven trumpets
[27:14] all right you agree exactly you've read
[27:17] it you know I'm telling you the truth
[27:18] okay here we go Feast of trumpets now
[27:21] the Feast of trumpets now this was a
[27:23] gathering of Israel brother have said
[27:25] the trumpet's whole purpose doesn't
[27:26] gather Israel back to their Homeland
[27:28] right right quote verbatim right right
[27:30] where they gathered together the Feast
[27:32] of the trumpets listen as a minister of
[27:35] the Gospel I can't see one thing left
[27:37] but the going of the bride and the bride
[27:39] has to be taken away before they can
[27:41] recognize what happened right before the
[27:44] Jews will recognize their atonement we
[27:47] got to get out of the way
[27:49] we're holding the whole thing up people
[27:52] remember I told you the these religious
[27:54] things are totally determined on the
[27:56] moon the church you see it is it's a
[28:00] fact
[28:01] okay they were bound scattered I mean
[28:04] they were scattered blinded and now
[28:05] gathered Israelis thought about what's
[28:08] left the bride to be taken out of the
[28:09] way waiting for the going of the rights
[28:11] so their prophets of Revelation 11 can
[28:15] tell it can call them to the Feast of
[28:18] the trumpet right it's trumpets you know
[28:21] what I mean but actually it's trumpet
[28:23] right right he's right
[28:26] that's not a wrong statement that
[28:28] doesn't say Feast of trumpets Brother
[28:30] Francis Feast to trumpet right right you
[28:32] just look at that you say no he's wrong
[28:33] no he's right
[28:35] I'll I'll prove it to you I can prove it
[28:37] to you in Matthew yeah there are two
[28:39] angels that sounded but it was one
[28:41] trumpet exactly do you agree does it say
[28:43] in Matthew 24. I got him in all these
[28:46] notes that I'm never going to get to so
[28:47] I'm going to have to just say it and
[28:48] you're gonna have to go read it okay
[28:50] let's go to the next one
[28:51] oh Daniel's 70 weeks oh yeah
[28:56] listen
[28:57] bring it up though you got okay here's
[29:00] what remember I quoted this morning now
[29:01] where now we're where I'm I'm gonna go
[29:03] wide open on it Revelation 6 1 to
[29:05] Revelation 19 21 is it connected with
[29:08] the 70 weeks
[29:09] you know what Revelation 6 1 is first
[29:12] seal
[29:13] right
[29:16] hey if if you don't get these Daniels
[29:18] say we sure don't get them sealed
[29:22] people don't understand what he said
[29:26] therefore we must stop and explain
[29:27] before we go further we must stop and
[29:29] explain why these 70 weeks because if
[29:31] you don't you'll miss those seals
[29:34] hmm
[29:35] isn't that what 6-1 is first seal right
[29:38] okay you'll miss the trumpets
[29:41] you'll miss the vials
[29:43] those plagues
[29:45] those three unclean spirits like frogs
[29:47] those three woes see when you don't get
[29:50] Daniel 70 weeks you miss a lot of things
[29:52] people like I say this morning if you
[29:55] don't get it take six through 19 and
[29:57] tear it out of your ramble for
[29:59] Revelations it's wasting so what do we
[30:01] got now we got a bunch of preachers
[30:02] around the message who don't even
[30:03] understand Revelation 6 1 to Revelation
[30:07] 19. that's right
[30:09] sad story right I feel sorry for them
[30:12] the casting out of the red dragon the
[30:14] woman in the sun you'll miss it all
[30:18] did he say oh
[30:20] yeah okay all right
[30:22] I've had people say well all I hear
[30:24] Brother Samuel say is Daniel 70 weeks
[30:26] you know what I'm gonna be honest with
[30:28] you guys if you got Spirit of adultery
[30:30] on you every time he preaches all you'll
[30:32] hear is adultery
[30:34] when you come to a point and you don't
[30:36] go any further that's all you hear God's
[30:38] not going to move you beyond that until
[30:40] you take care of that right
[30:42] right you get a preacher and I come out
[30:44] here I preach adultery you have me six
[30:47] months from now I preach adultery six
[30:49] months later I come and preach adultery
[30:51] you know what I got a problem with I got
[30:52] a problem with adultery
[30:54] whatever you preach your preachers all
[30:55] the time that's why that's why you got
[30:57] to preach all of it amen if I get hung
[30:59] up on anyone I'm hung up I'm not moving
[31:03] okay because if you don't okay you'll
[31:06] miss it all if you don't because it
[31:08] takes place right here in this where
[31:10] does it take place
[31:13] 90 of the preachers in a message say we
[31:16] got three and a half years left
[31:21] you can't get all that in in three and a
[31:22] half years
[31:23] I'm not too bright but I'll tell you you
[31:25] can't get all that's happening what he
[31:28] said in this verse you can't get all
[31:30] these things casting the Red Dragon
[31:33] that comes after the two prophets are
[31:35] killed right the seven vials comes after
[31:38] the two prophets are killed the prophets
[31:41] Minister for how long 1260 days three
[31:43] and a half years
[31:44] if you get them if you get them off at
[31:47] three and a half and God don't go on
[31:48] dealing with them how are you gonna get
[31:50] the rest of it in right
[31:52] you see what they're doing they're
[31:54] taking an absolutely cutting scripture
[31:56] out by their revelation of what they
[31:58] think he said
[32:00] that's why I say he meant what he said
[32:02] on his chart three and a half years of
[32:04] Ministry for those two witnesses and
[32:07] another three and a half he calls it
[32:08] Great Tribulation go look at his chart
[32:13] you guys know it so I don't have to just
[32:14] hold it up here in front of you so you
[32:17] mentioned now look because it takes
[32:19] place right here in the 70th week
[32:22] all of it right right all these things
[32:25] take place in the 70s week does
[32:26] everybody agree with that amen
[32:28] well anybody's got a little brain at all
[32:30] can understand what's those two profits
[32:32] are cut off the vials will start falling
[32:35] and see this is my mistake I always
[32:37] thought when brother when when you talk
[32:39] about plagues the vials are plagues but
[32:41] the seven trumpets are the seven plagues
[32:44] that push Israel back to her Homeland
[32:46] right the seven vials is what Falls
[32:48] after the two witnesses are dead
[32:51] this the vials are judgment because I'm
[32:54] gonna be honest with you after that
[32:56] there's nobody to redeem right right
[32:58] right
[33:00] let me make a statement brother bam said
[33:02] when the Gentile bride goes up then we
[33:05] got three and a half year of ministry
[33:06] under those two witnesses he said after
[33:08] the bride goes up there will not be
[33:10] another Gentile Save Right right do you
[33:12] agree amen what's those two three and a
[33:14] half years take place those two
[33:16] witnesses and the hundred and I'll I'll
[33:18] go and live I believe it's 144 000
[33:20] arrests erected with them
[33:22] if they're going to show up in the
[33:23] Millennium like where'd they resurrect
[33:26] right does that kind of blow you guys
[33:27] away
[33:29] are you okay with that
[33:31] amen where are you going to get the
[33:32] hunter are they going to resurrect at
[33:33] the Millennium right right then you
[33:35] gotta
[33:36] Resurrection spoken there the only thing
[33:38] between the them dying in the streets
[33:41] and res is in two prophets I believe
[33:43] they'll follow their two just like when
[33:44] brother Brown goes up you'll fall right
[33:46] in behind him
[33:48] man did he say it right iridius will go
[33:51] up and his group will fall right in
[33:52] behind him
[33:56] it fits the message for me guys
[33:59] okay I don't lose no continuity with it
[34:03] right so you got you know where I'm at
[34:04] with Daniel 70 weeks I'm I agree with
[34:06] you on that
[34:08] very few people do and then why wouldn't
[34:10] he let me preach the seven trumpets even
[34:13] I was ready to announce it had the holes
[34:14] ready and everything to go into preach
[34:16] the seven trumpets and I said there's
[34:18] something bothering me so bad I said we
[34:20] kept on working and Billy and all of us
[34:23] trying to get ready for the
[34:24] air-conditioned building for this next
[34:26] coming week for the saving trumpets
[34:27] Savvy 10 days or eight days had the
[34:30] school he was going to preach the
[34:31] trumpets just like he did in seals the
[34:33] seals he preached seven days is that
[34:34] right question answers between
[34:37] everybody agree with that that's what he
[34:39] did
[34:40] I told Holy Spirit wouldn't let me do it
[34:42] for some reason exactly I'm going in and
[34:44] sincerely I knelt down for God to pray
[34:46] and he revealed to me that them seven
[34:48] trumpets sounded under the Sixth Seal
[34:53] and I've done preached it supernaturally
[34:57] you want to understand the seven
[34:58] trumpets go read The Sixth Seal exactly
[35:01] is that what he said all seven trumpets
[35:04] were revealed to me under the Sixth Seal
[35:06] right they were open
[35:09] that's what he's saying that's right is
[35:11] anybody okay with what I'm saying here
[35:12] start wagging your head and amen
[35:15] I'm gonna hang up here
[35:18] if you want to hear the rest of the
[35:19] story you better start doing this
[35:21] okay
[35:23] and we picked up under the Sixth ceiling
[35:25] all of you have that how the persecution
[35:27] of the Jews right the six seal what's it
[35:30] seven trumpets persecution of the Jews
[35:33] everybody good with that let's go now
[35:35] you see under the fifth seal we find
[35:36] here martyrdom
[35:38] and I added a quote to this somewhere I
[35:40] think maybe I'll find out when we get to
[35:42] it and under the 24-9 now he's talking
[35:44] about Matthew 24. does everybody
[35:46] understand other six seals the First
[35:48] Brethren brought Matthew 24 in yeah
[35:52] Matthew for 24 there was three questions
[35:54] given
[35:55] right it was Jews asking Jesus about the
[35:57] temple
[35:59] the signing when would the temple be
[36:01] restored or destroyed
[36:02] he said and he made it clear Titus
[36:04] destroyed it in 70 A.D that's finished
[36:07] right so he said when will the temple be
[36:10] restored when will be the sign of thy
[36:12] coming and when will be the end is that
[36:15] the three questions in Matthew 24. amen
[36:17] right
[36:19] we'll see he went away from the Jews
[36:21] he's going back so Matthew 20 I'm going
[36:23] to say this I don't know how Matthew 24
[36:25] really applies to Israel now there's
[36:28] characteristics and pieces of it we use
[36:30] do you agree does everybody agree with
[36:33] that but but the fullness of Matthew 24
[36:35] is really to the Jews do you agree
[36:37] because remember it was all about was
[36:40] the temple going to be rebuilt right
[36:42] when's Temple going to be destroyed when
[36:45] is the end going to be is everybody got
[36:47] what I'm saying so brother ran him
[36:49] perfectly under the Sixth Seal placed
[36:51] Matthew 24. and then brother Brandon
[36:53] preaches and shows us where the six
[36:55] seals show up under right Matthew 24.
[36:58] then he preaches Matthew in 24 out of
[37:01] The Sixth Seal
[37:02] all seven trumpets sound under the Sixth
[37:06] Seal exactly brother Branham is placing
[37:08] them perfectly for us he said the
[37:10] trumpets are the same thing to the Jews
[37:13] that the seals are to us
[37:15] everybody okay with that
[37:17] that makes a difference later on right
[37:19] they shall deliver you up to kill you
[37:21] and so forth same seal being open now
[37:23] six seal is the one we're coming to now
[37:25] Matthew 24 29. okay
[37:29] 6 12 through whatever
[37:31] oh man I'm about to Where's My Water
[37:33] somebody can you give me a glass
[37:34] somebody give me a bottle of water
[37:38] it says and you remember the scripture
[37:40] and it's he says it here so I'll just
[37:41] hear immediately after the tribulation
[37:43] of those days what days is he talking
[37:45] about right brother Branham brings in an
[37:47] amateur tribulation or pre-tribulation
[37:50] okay now let's read it what win this
[37:52] tribute this amateur tribulation they
[37:54] went through here see the sun shall be
[37:57] dark and the moon shall not give her
[37:58] light stars shall fall from the heaven
[37:59] the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and
[38:02] then shall appear the sign of the son of
[38:04] man right
[38:05] after that right exactly okay
[38:10] and then shall all the tribes the Earth
[38:12] mourn and they shall see now who's the
[38:13] tribes is that us or Israel
[38:15] you ain't a tribe that's Israel
[38:18] right right 12 tribes of Israel
[38:21] so mostly Matthew 24 is to Israel amen
[38:24] but Brethren sees the the type anti-type
[38:28] of it and pulls it out for us right
[38:30] okay
[38:31] Where'd I get to True okay here's what I
[38:34] want immediately after the tribulation
[38:36] of those days remember it says
[38:36] immediately after tribulation that's
[38:38] exactly what it says in Matthew 24.
[38:40] win this tribulation that amortization
[38:43] they went through is here see the
[38:44] sunshine already read that and then
[38:46] shall appear the sign of the son of man
[38:48] in heaven remember I preached here in
[38:49] 1962 those seven planets lined up that
[38:53] was the sign of the son of man I
[38:55] preached a year before sign of Aquarius
[38:57] right which is son of man did it happen
[38:59] after that
[39:01] the tribulation of those days what
[39:03] tribulation is talking about World War
[39:04] II
[39:05] the sixth trumpet and we'll get to it in
[39:08] a minute I'm gonna scatter it I'm gonna
[39:10] bring it back to you here in a bit so I
[39:11] see your looks okay and they shall see
[39:14] the son of man come in the Clouds Of
[39:16] Heaven with power and Glade Glory next
[39:17] quote
[39:19] now I'm going to talk about the first
[39:20] four trouble let's read them let's read
[39:22] the okay and the Seven Angels which had
[39:24] the seven trumpets prepared itself to
[39:25] sound
[39:26] now look this is a comment for me only
[39:29] place you can associate the seven Trump
[39:31] I misspelled it seven trumpets with the
[39:33] Feast of trumpets
[39:34] one scripture in the Bible
[39:37] there you go to the Old Testament put in
[39:39] seven trumpets you know where you'll get
[39:40] it
[39:41] when they went around the city
[39:44] and there were seven Trumpets on the
[39:45] seventh day do you agree right those
[39:47] said that never said seven trumpets
[39:49] associated with the Feast of trumpets
[39:51] right right we don't know how many there
[39:53] were until this hour
[39:57] right without brother Branham you'd have
[39:59] never known the answer to that does
[40:01] everybody got one is everybody with me
[40:03] so far go to the Old Testament and find
[40:06] seven trumpets under the Feast of
[40:08] trumpets and you can't find it
[40:12] that's one of the Mysteries that's been
[40:13] open in this hour
[40:15] what these trumpets really are
[40:17] the first okay I got that yeah first
[40:21] Angel sounded in their fallen hell and
[40:22] fire mingle with blood and they were
[40:24] cast upon the Earth the third part of
[40:26] the trees was burned up all the green
[40:27] grass was burnt in the second Angel
[40:29] sounded as it were a great Mountain
[40:31] burning with fire was cast in The Sea
[40:33] and the third part of the sea became
[40:34] blood third part of the creatures which
[40:37] were in the sea and had life died in the
[40:39] third part of the ships were destroyed
[40:42] and the third Angel sounded and there
[40:44] felt and her fellow great star from
[40:46] Heaven burning as a lamp and it fell
[40:48] upon a third Heart part of the waters
[40:50] upon The Fountains of the waters and the
[40:52] name of the star is called wormwood he's
[40:54] the angel over water see God's got or
[40:56] Angel's order he got seraphims cherubims
[40:58] wormwood Michael Gabriel and there's
[41:01] order to them right
[41:04] see if you don't have order you got
[41:05] chaos you'll have Angels tripping over
[41:07] Angels right God don't do that he hasn't
[41:10] he said Mr wormwood this is your job
[41:13] you're in charge of the waters right is
[41:15] that right
[41:16] so he gives every Angel a charge of
[41:18] something right that's their job right
[41:20] it's kind of the way we do it in the
[41:21] Work World don't we you come up do
[41:23] somebody else you're doing my job that's
[41:25] not in my job description see God's
[41:27] guide put a job description for these
[41:29] guys too fourth Angel sound third part
[41:31] of the son was Smith in the third part
[41:32] of the moon and the third part of the
[41:34] stars as the third part
[41:36] of them was darkened and the day shown
[41:38] not for the third part of it and the
[41:40] night likewise quote now this calling of
[41:43] the Feast of the Trump is the
[41:44] approaching of something notice
[41:46] Revelation 8 7. if you want it right
[41:48] there's only I went out to the message
[41:50] and I looked up first trumpet second
[41:51] trumpet third Trump a fourth trumpet
[41:53] there's only two quotes you'll find on
[41:55] those four trumpets
[41:56] and I'm gonna read them to you and the
[41:58] only trumpet he talks about is the first
[42:00] trumpet
[42:01] and there's a reason he does it and the
[42:03] scripture will answer why brother random
[42:05] did it okay
[42:07] okay now calling of the feasts notice
[42:10] that Revelation 8 7 you want to write it
[42:11] down we know it's the first trumpet
[42:13] they're scattered hell Blood Fire upon
[42:14] you are just exactly what the Exodus
[42:16] when God was calling his people out of
[42:18] the Exodus now the reason that these
[42:20] seven trumpets does not apply to this
[42:21] church in this age is because it is only
[42:24] it's the calling of the Gathering of the
[42:26] people so the purpose of the trumpets
[42:29] their plagues
[42:31] to gather Israel back to their Homeland
[42:33] now let me let me tell you something go
[42:36] look at the Old Testament when God moved
[42:38] Abraham out off that mountain down into
[42:40] Egypt how did it happen
[42:42] plague a famine hit the land right and
[42:46] he moved down to Egypt tried to give his
[42:48] wife away God all God was doing was
[42:50] trying to set a time
[42:52] right right God knew it was going to
[42:53] happen he just wanted to fulfill his
[42:55] word right God's obligated he's going to
[42:56] set a type for us right
[42:58] so what moved Abraham a plague
[43:01] right you agree right
[43:02] so he went down there and finally got
[43:04] back to the mountain right what moved
[43:07] Israel where they went into bondage for
[43:09] 400 years out of the land to Egypt what
[43:13] moved them
[43:14] plague
[43:16] what moved him out of Egypt back into
[43:19] the promised land right
[43:21] plague when God wants to move Israel he
[43:24] puts a plague on them oh yeah
[43:26] when he wants to move us he's going to
[43:28] let the pressure go
[43:31] right you're gonna get the same thing
[43:32] church folk right
[43:35] Little Eagles you've been with bunny fur
[43:37] in your nest too long God's fixing to
[43:40] turn the bunny fur out and you're gonna
[43:42] go
[43:44] you know what they are thorns underneath
[43:45] there
[43:46] and he gonna put thorns in the bottom of
[43:48] it he'll put you know nice bunny fur in
[43:51] it and you'll sit there fat dumb and
[43:53] happy that's what laodiceans are we're
[43:55] Eagles in a layout of seeing atmosphere
[43:59] and we're just laying there yeah we're
[44:01] not moving we're not doing it God's
[44:04] going to put the pressure on one day
[44:05] you're going to wake up and go
[44:08] you're going to have thorns you know
[44:10] what they do then they jump out of their
[44:11] nests and start flying all right brother
[44:13] said you want to show who you are wait
[44:15] till the pressure comes don't prove who
[44:16] you are you could say you believe this
[44:18] message you could say you have the
[44:20] fullest the word when this pressure
[44:21] comes you're going to prove it then
[44:23] buddy you better not fake it you better
[44:25] get the goods now because when the
[44:27] pressure comes out it's gonna be too
[44:28] late for a lot of you
[44:30] 600 or 200 or whatever but I said
[44:32] scriptures will fulfill the last hours
[44:34] of Jesus Christ we've come to the last
[44:37] hours of the Gentile dispensation God's
[44:39] fixing to pull the bunny hair out you
[44:41] better get the fullest word in you now
[44:48] and now there's only one insignificance
[44:50] in here that I want you to get to in a
[44:52] few minutes is where you'll see why this
[44:54] doesn't apply the age that we're living
[44:55] in the seven trumpets next quote
[44:58] the Gathering of Israel is the trumpets
[45:00] the trumpets gather Israel so we know
[45:03] what the brother said the trumpets are
[45:04] plagues
[45:05] and I I proved it by the Old Testament
[45:07] if he wanted to move me plagued them
[45:09] right he turned a plague on them then
[45:12] they'd move to where he they'd go where
[45:13] he wanted them to go exactly I told the
[45:16] church you deer hunters you got a deer
[45:18] and it's a cornfield he's gonna go down
[45:19] the easiest path to get there until you
[45:22] fire the first shot right
[45:24] first shot fired you made all fired
[45:26] somebody fired it next day you go out
[45:28] there and that deer went 10 days up and
[45:30] down there you said buddy when opening
[45:32] season comes up first day I'm gonna get
[45:34] this Buck you go out there nothing
[45:36] you know why pressure come they had to
[45:38] change what they were doing
[45:41] some of you are going to change the
[45:42] things you're doing when that pressure
[45:44] comes down I'm going to tell you again
[45:46] the bunny hair is coming out and you're
[45:48] going to start flying
[45:51] it's coming brother am said to get
[45:53] rapidly worse now brother brainer is a
[45:55] quote where he said the pressures now I
[45:56] believe I believe it gets I believe it's
[45:58] getting rapidly worse right
[46:00] right if there's going to come an hour
[46:01] where you're not going to be happy
[46:02] sitting in your little nest
[46:04] you're going to get weary of being in
[46:05] this flesh right and if Fords are going
[46:07] to start you're going to say I want even
[46:09] so Lord come quickly
[46:11] that the pressure is what's going to
[46:13] bring you to that point if the pressure
[46:15] draws Israel back to their Homeland the
[46:17] same pressure is going to draw you up
[46:20] you're going to get pressure just count
[46:22] on it
[46:24] okay
[46:25] now I want to show you something here
[46:27] I'm going to say something that's kind
[46:28] of out of my notes but you understand I
[46:31] just read what the four trumpets were
[46:32] right
[46:33] does everybody agree with that
[46:35] I just read them listen oh I don't know
[46:38] if they got the slide there
[46:41] let me read that thing
[46:45] all right what happened was I had all
[46:47] these notes nice and neat my computer
[46:48] crashed two weeks ago I lost them I've
[46:50] tried to rebuild them but I'm not
[46:52] preaching it so I don't I I just threw
[46:54] it together I'm sorry I really feel bad
[46:56] but you know what I was a computer guy
[46:58] for 34 years I told the customer back up
[47:00] back up back up my computer blew and I
[47:03] had six months of notes I lost
[47:05] what an idiot 34 years I appreciate that
[47:07] message
[47:11] the register wouldn't be many preachers
[47:13] make it they preach it can't live it
[47:16] I guess I'm proof of that I.T guy
[47:19] preached it I didn't live it
[47:22] so we're gonna back up that was chapter
[47:23] eight I read in do you agree let's go
[47:25] Jack chapter seven now we understand
[47:27] four trumpets then the fifth then the
[47:30] sixth then the seventh trumpet but he
[47:33] gives the forward is everybody agree
[47:35] that these four trumpets are an
[47:37] interruption in nature
[47:40] go read it
[47:42] right it's trees it's water does
[47:44] everybody agree
[47:45] those first four trumpets are an
[47:46] interruption of water of nature right
[47:49] totally the first four trumpets that's
[47:51] what they are
[47:52] everybody I just read it let's read
[47:55] these quotes go ahead let's read I can
[47:57] say something awful good right here but
[47:58] I guess I'll hold it until tomorrow
[48:00] night see all right and have power
[48:03] now he's talking about the two witnesses
[48:05] and that power of the waters to turn
[48:06] into the blood that's what it says in
[48:08] the first one or within trumpets do you
[48:10] agree I just read it
[48:12] smart deals with plagues as often as
[48:14] they will
[48:15] what is it what can bring these things
[48:17] but the word they can do nature any way
[48:19] they want to here it is they're the one
[48:21] who brings on The Sixth Seal exactly all
[48:24] seven trumpets sound under what seal
[48:27] okay
[48:28] they uncover and open it up it's the
[48:30] power of God to interrupt nature right
[48:32] the first trumpet through the fourth
[48:34] trumpet is the interruption in nature
[48:36] everybody agree with that right
[48:39] they can send earthquakes turn the moon
[48:41] into blood right
[48:43] he and I told him he would get on set
[48:45] you know they talking about these Blood
[48:46] Moons going on do you understand Jesus
[48:48] at the Passover when he's on the Mount
[48:49] of Olives he said his swellwood go read
[48:52] it Saint Luke 22 44. his sweat was as
[48:54] blood
[48:55] right his sweat was not blood what it
[48:58] was there was a blood moon and he was
[49:00] looking into it
[49:01] does everybody got that every time
[49:03] there's a blood moon in Israel something
[49:05] happened significantly in Israel
[49:07] does everybody agree with that we got
[49:09] one coming up April the 29th the pope
[49:12] will be there on that day did you know
[49:13] that there's going to be another eclipse
[49:16] during the day
[49:17] when you get a blood moon what happens
[49:19] is one of those they call them a
[49:21] Treacher while I looked it up there's a
[49:24] black eclipse of the Sun the next day
[49:26] remember Jesus's sweat was blood he was
[49:28] looking at the moon it was a Blood Moon
[49:30] the next day from that what ninth hour
[49:32] to do it was Darkness there was an
[49:35] eclipse that's exactly what's going to
[49:36] happen when the Pope's here
[49:38] now the pope ain't Jesus
[49:40] but God when he deals with Israel
[49:42] there's blood moons when Israel was sent
[49:45] out of Spain during Isabel and
[49:46] ferdinand's Rule they were they were
[49:49] forbidden to be in Spain they put them
[49:51] on ships and what the ship mashed
[49:53] through they'd sell out in the ocean and
[49:55] they told the Jews just what the Germans
[49:57] did pack up all your Earthly possessions
[49:59] they'd put them on the boat those cabins
[50:01] take them out kill them and steal what
[50:02] they had
[50:04] you know what Hitler did he went in and
[50:06] said pack all your belongings everything
[50:07] you want to take with you put them in
[50:09] luggage and come on they get to the
[50:11] death camp they'd take their luggage
[50:13] throw it over here you're going to take
[50:13] a shower and you'll pick it back up well
[50:15] they put all their money in silver and
[50:17] gold in there it just made them easy
[50:19] they didn't have to go to the apartment
[50:20] figure out where they hid it all right
[50:22] that's exactly what they did under
[50:24] Isabella and Ferdinand go read it those
[50:26] Jews died out there they pushed they
[50:28] they said some of them would you know
[50:30] Jews love money they said some of them
[50:32] eat their jewelry and stuff and then
[50:34] cabbage the ship cut them open skin them
[50:35] out like a fish and get the old out of
[50:37] them
[50:38] a Jew is a Jew likes their money people
[50:40] I'm telling you that's why God can't
[50:43] just go to the Jews and say get out of
[50:45] here
[50:46] you gotta drive them out because they
[50:48] love they idle look we'll read it in the
[50:51] next trumpet I'll get on it there's so
[50:54] much I want to get there and I'm you
[50:56] know so we understand it's the
[50:57] interruption there okay right here
[50:59] interval between the six and seventh and
[51:01] seal let's go here right here buddy
[51:04] now now we notice that being just one
[51:06] verse here we'd like to do something
[51:08] just a little a little bit here if you
[51:10] would notice we skipped the seventh
[51:12] chapter so he skipped the seventh
[51:14] chapter right that's under the seventh
[51:17] seal the seventh chapter of Revelations
[51:18] right so he's calling it an interval you
[51:21] agree
[51:22] the six seal the seven seal there's
[51:24] something take between the sixth and
[51:25] seventh chapter
[51:27] okay if you notice the seven chapter we
[51:29] know it's between the six and seven
[51:30] there's an interval an interval between
[51:32] the sixth and seventh chapter book and
[51:34] it's between the sixth and seventh seal
[51:36] right
[51:37] all seven trumpets sound of The Sixth
[51:40] Seal right everybody agree I'll keep you
[51:43] back there that this interval is given
[51:45] now we want to notice this very
[51:46] important that we notice this little
[51:47] time next quote now we notice the
[51:50] interval now between the six and seventh
[51:51] chapter now the seventh chapter
[51:52] Revelation here as it reveals the
[51:54] happening he's going to tell you what
[51:56] that interval is right right right
[51:58] scripture interprets itself
[52:00] it's not in here just for nothing it's
[52:02] putting out not between in between this
[52:05] for nothing it is here for a purpose
[52:07] it's a revelation that reveals something
[52:09] notice how mysterious and how
[52:11] mathematically it fits right into
[52:12] scripture exactly you believe in God's
[52:15] mathematics if you don't you're sure
[52:17] lost
[52:18] what
[52:20] most of them don't believe in God's
[52:22] mathematics with Daniel 70 weeks might
[52:24] as well just
[52:26] you're sure get lost in the word look at
[52:28] what he said I want to tell you I hear
[52:31] message preacher after message preacher
[52:33] after message feature say this and they
[52:35] don't even understand what they're
[52:36] saying right
[52:38] right
[52:39] yeah we're just saying it just quote
[52:40] loader exactly
[52:43] if you start putting a four or six or
[52:44] something beside just the mathematical
[52:46] words running in order you'll sure have
[52:48] in your scene a cow picking grass in the
[52:51] top of the tree somewhere people don't
[52:53] get Daniel 70 weeks are picking they're
[52:55] they got a cat on the tree picking grass
[52:58] is that what he's saying
[53:00] there's something in between here you
[53:01] need to get
[53:03] did Brother Madam say that the trumpets
[53:05] were included in the 70th week
[53:08] now I didn't say that I read it to you
[53:10] earlier did I not the woes did he say it
[53:13] the vials right they don't get Daniel 70
[53:15] weeks are they the cow picking the grass
[53:17] out of the top of the tree
[53:19] he'll have their picture right do they
[53:21] that's what he's talking about right I
[53:24] don't know how you may think
[53:26] you certainly run out because God does
[53:27] not his whole word does not does run
[53:29] completely in mathematics yes sir
[53:31] perfect the most perfect there's no
[53:32] other literature written like it so
[53:34] perfect in math mathematics next one
[53:36] let's go up thanks
[53:39] and we're going to speak here now in the
[53:41] seventh chapter just a minute to kind of
[53:43] bridge it in between the sixth and
[53:45] seventh seal there's your interval right
[53:47] right he's still talking about your
[53:48] interval listen to kind of bridge it in
[53:50] between the six and seven seal because
[53:52] that's the only material that we have to
[53:54] go on right now
[53:56] is the six between the six and seventh
[53:58] seal is the calling out of Israel amen
[54:01] remember brother Anthony don't get hung
[54:03] up on the seal brother Brahm said the
[54:05] seal is the coming of the Lord
[54:07] it's opening of the word anybody agree
[54:09] with that
[54:11] huh he said it's the end of all things
[54:13] when brother babe talks to seven seal
[54:15] which one of those are you talking about
[54:17] he's talking about between the six and
[54:19] seven he's talking about the end of all
[54:21] things
[54:22] do you understand what I'm saying you've
[54:23] got to understand what brother man says
[54:25] seventh seal which part of that is he
[54:27] talking about
[54:28] that's why he told us even the six seals
[54:30] got three parts to it
[54:32] everybody remember the three parts
[54:34] six seals Redemption it's the redeemed
[54:37] 144 000. the foolish virgin and to purge
[54:42] the Earth
[54:43] and the trumpets are under the Sixth
[54:45] Seal
[54:46] is that what he said
[54:48] so six sealed all it deals with is those
[54:50] three people
[54:51] you agree okay I know you I know you did
[54:54] I better quit picking on you you're the
[54:56] good guy you don't pick one of the guys
[54:58] wearing a white hat
[54:59] okay okay
[55:02] now I have many fine Jehovah Witness
[55:04] friends sitting here it's all or have
[55:05] been maybe some of them let's go down to
[55:07] where it's highlighted I'm gonna be here
[55:09] all day it's not it has nothing to do
[55:11] with the church age at all they're
[55:12] absolutely Israel
[55:14] right now this interval between the six
[55:16] the seals is the calling and ceiling of
[55:18] 144 000 Jews called in a tribulation
[55:21] period after the church is gone see it
[55:25] has nothing to do with the church age at
[55:26] all oh called in perfectly in harmony
[55:29] with the scriptures Daniel's last three
[55:32] and one half years what's he talking
[55:35] about the 144 000 where are they sealed
[55:38] right in the last three and a half years
[55:41] of ministry right he's not talking and
[55:44] saying Daniel 70 weeks only has three
[55:46] and a half years in it there's only
[55:49] three and a half years of redemption in
[55:51] it exactly once those three and a half
[55:53] years are over and it was 144 000 are
[55:57] done and gone there's no Reser there is
[55:59] no Redemption for the Jew
[56:02] just like when we go up in the Rapture
[56:04] There's No Redemption for the Gentiles
[56:08] brother man said once we take the
[56:10] Rapture there will not be another
[56:12] Gentile saved amen they can't come all
[56:15] the way they might come out but they
[56:17] can't go into Redemption has two parts
[56:20] understand what it is
[56:24] so once those Jews get cut off that last
[56:26] three and a half years judgment there
[56:29] ain't nobody going to be saved in that
[56:30] last it's the wrath of God being spewed
[56:33] up on the earth it'll destroy the dead
[56:35] wood that's here
[56:37] if John a man said if a tree's dead cut
[56:40] it down and fire that
[56:42] what do you think God's gonna do it's
[56:43] dead woods they don't breathe the fruit
[56:45] for it right they have no purpose in
[56:48] being here that's tough isn't it
[56:50] all of them at the end of that three
[56:52] inch nothing but cannon fodder
[56:58] right
[56:59] oh called in perfectly in harmony with
[57:01] the scripture Daniel's last three and
[57:03] one free allotted to Daniel's people
[57:04] that's true there ain't gonna be
[57:08] it's three and a half years of
[57:09] redemption
[57:10] redemption's over do you agree
[57:12] the three and a half years Israel's
[57:14] going to start getting judgments they uh
[57:16] right the three and a half years of
[57:17] those two prophets Brethren later on 64
[57:19] said it he said to them two props so I
[57:21] think they're gonna bring tribulation
[57:22] down on the Gentile once they leave
[57:24] tribulation is going to be rained down
[57:25] on everybody right right whoever's left
[57:28] they're gonna get it
[57:29] you agree
[57:34] a lot of dangerous people see not the
[57:36] Gentiles to Daniel's people and Daniel
[57:37] was a Jew next quote exactly or here we
[57:40] go now remember the first four so what
[57:43] we always do and even the scripture says
[57:44] it but you understand what it's saying
[57:47] we got four trumpets got fifth trumpet
[57:49] six trumpets I even read the fifth and
[57:50] sixth grade I'm going to so we you know
[57:53] to get to the fifth and sixth you got to
[57:54] get the four do you agree right
[57:57] right you agree right okay am I okay are
[57:59] your mathematics right
[58:01] but there's something comes up with
[58:02] those four
[58:04] that they get stopped
[58:06] let's read it right here so it's
[58:09] scripture you got to put it together and
[58:10] brothers said there's an interval
[58:12] and the intervals chapter seven is that
[58:14] what he said exactly look we'll get
[58:17] there in a minute
[58:18] and after these things I saw four Angels
[58:20] standing on four corners are holding the
[58:21] four waves the Earth and that the wind
[58:23] should not blow on the earth nor on the
[58:25] seat or on the tree when I read the
[58:26] first four trumpets wasn't that plagues
[58:28] on the Earth
[58:29] interruption in nature this is what it's
[58:31] referenced back to okay and I saw
[58:34] another Angel sinning from the East
[58:36] right having the Seal of God does it
[58:38] sound like the e-course Rider remember
[58:39] the acorn right where he marked them is
[58:42] that what he did in the Old Testament
[58:43] right he said Mark them and don't hurt
[58:46] them because they'll Escape out of the
[58:48] city is that what it was there in Titus
[58:49] brother Ben brought it who is this it's
[58:52] the acorn writer right
[58:54] right it's the Holy Ghost exactly
[58:55] they're going to receive a holy ghost
[58:57] seals 144 thousand I can prove it right
[58:59] here right they're going to get an acorn
[59:00] Rider going to come through and mark
[59:01] them right with the Seal of God is that
[59:03] what Dean corn Rider does read it look
[59:09] voice to the Four Angels two is given to
[59:12] hurt the earth and the sea
[59:14] those angels that were overlooked could
[59:17] hurt the earth and the sea but there's
[59:19] some made them stop
[59:21] listen to what it was saying hurt not
[59:24] the Earth neither the sea nor the trees
[59:26] till right we have sealed the Servants
[59:29] of our God in their forehead
[59:36] it's an interval do you agree
[59:38] it's rather it says interval between the
[59:40] sixth and seventh seal there's an
[59:42] interval between the sixth and seventh
[59:44] trumpet this is the interval he's
[59:46] talking about scriptural and he says it
[59:48] he says Revelation chapter seven he
[59:50] points this right back here
[59:52] I know it's kind of it'll come together
[59:53] I promise you it will when you see my
[59:55] timeline you'll see it even everybody
[59:57] understand that right
[59:59] I'm gonna go here I heard the number of
[1:00:00] them which were sealed sealed so it
[1:00:03] means they got the Holy Ghost 144 of
[1:00:04] that is going to say the same Holy Ghost
[1:00:06] you got it's going to be under the son
[1:00:07] of man Ministry brother babe said
[1:00:09] proving his word it's all gathered up
[1:00:12] under the son of man
[1:00:15] everybody agree with that that Messiah
[1:00:17] week is the son of man Ministry the
[1:00:20] seven Church ages get that
[1:00:22] we on the other side of the age it
[1:00:24] receives the the Mysteries the
[1:00:26] Revelation we've come on we got to
[1:00:28] revelation
[1:00:30] we've received the the revealed word
[1:00:32] who's your maintenance I heard it
[1:00:34] brother for him say
[1:00:36] the revealed word why did he say it That
[1:00:38] Way Baptist says they believe the Bible
[1:00:41] there's one Church saying we only we
[1:00:43] just we stay with the Bible only you
[1:00:45] liar
[1:00:50] I heard another sealed never sealed 144
[1:00:52] 000 of all the tribes of the children of
[1:00:55] Israel
[1:00:56] go up to where it says Levi I think I
[1:00:58] got it underlined Maybe
[1:01:03] does everybody understand Levi wasn't in
[1:01:05] the 12 tribes
[1:01:08] they were taken out yeah
[1:01:10] these 144 000 Levi's put back in you
[1:01:13] know why
[1:01:14] this is not going to be a levitical
[1:01:15] priesthood forum that's why God ain't
[1:01:17] gonna let him build that that what they
[1:01:20] want to build to sacrifice Idols they
[1:01:22] don't need a levitical priesthood he
[1:01:24] died once for all
[1:01:26] right got it look God's taking the
[1:01:27] Levi's out of being over him and being
[1:01:29] priest he's putting them back in with
[1:01:31] the brethren
[1:01:33] so the Levi ain't nothing but like one
[1:01:35] of the other 11 tribes they're not a
[1:01:37] separated group they're going to have to
[1:01:39] seem the same message the other 11
[1:01:40] tribes do amen and see people in the
[1:01:43] message are working I know you said it
[1:01:44] I'm not talking about you they're
[1:01:46] talking about these Levi Richmond and
[1:01:47] all these guys that's the levitical
[1:01:49] priesthood yeah they I'm going to be
[1:01:52] honest with you guys I don't believe
[1:01:54] they're going to bring the son of man
[1:01:55] Ministry
[1:01:57] it's going to be Elijah and Moses Elijah
[1:02:00] and Moses is the israelic priesthood
[1:02:03] it's showing you that the levitical
[1:02:05] priesthood's over
[1:02:07] when God goes those 144 000 he's going
[1:02:10] to be dealing with a levitical
[1:02:11] priesthood he's going to be dealing with
[1:02:14] a Melchizedek priesthood exactly that's
[1:02:16] what that's telling you there and we're
[1:02:19] monkeying around with a bunch of Levites
[1:02:21] over there thinking that now they may be
[1:02:22] a part of the 144 000 fine
[1:02:25] but God ain't going to use that
[1:02:27] levitical priesthood anymore you
[1:02:29] understand
[1:02:31] it's the truth it's gonna be 144 000
[1:02:34] right okay go on let's go up
[1:02:40] going up
[1:02:42] okay there's another entity here
[1:02:45] uh
[1:02:48] where was it at brother anyway we
[1:02:50] understand the Jews where did the
[1:02:51] Gentiles start coming in brother where
[1:02:53] where back it up
[1:02:57] I think he's right there in it whoa whoa
[1:03:00] okay after there's three entities that's
[1:03:03] expressed in Revelation chapter 7.
[1:03:06] everybody understand what I'm saying
[1:03:08] between at six and seventh trumpet the
[1:03:11] sixth and seventh seal there's three
[1:03:13] entities that God deals with in
[1:03:14] Redemption
[1:03:16] I won't say three and let's go I know it
[1:03:18] kind of might blow your mind a little
[1:03:19] bit I'm gonna show you if I can by the
[1:03:21] quote okay listen to what says
[1:03:25] and this I'd be held a lower great
[1:03:27] multitude no man could number of all
[1:03:28] Nations kindreds and people in tongues
[1:03:30] it sounds like Gentiles don't it stood
[1:03:32] Before the Throne before the lamb
[1:03:33] clothed with white robes and Palms in
[1:03:35] her hand cried with a loud voice saying
[1:03:37] salvation to our god which set us upon
[1:03:39] the throne upon the lamb and all the
[1:03:41] Angels stood round about the throne and
[1:03:42] about the elders and the four beasts
[1:03:44] that fell Before the Throne of their
[1:03:46] faces and worshiped God saying amen
[1:03:48] blessing and the glory and wisdom and
[1:03:49] Thanksgiving honor and power and might
[1:03:51] be under our God forever and ever amen
[1:03:53] and one of the elders answers say to him
[1:03:55] what are these which are red and white
[1:03:57] robes and with skin that he didn't
[1:03:59] recognize the Gentiles right the elders
[1:04:01] only recognized the Jews they were Jews
[1:04:04] right
[1:04:05] we didn't have any of their tribal Garb
[1:04:08] on wait oh
[1:04:10] and I said unto him sir thou knowest he
[1:04:13] said to me these are they which came out
[1:04:15] of Great Tribulation now I'm gonna
[1:04:17] brother Bradham uses this scripture two
[1:04:19] ways
[1:04:20] and I know why he did it does the Bride
[1:04:23] come out of tribulation
[1:04:25] no the prince said we don't go in the
[1:04:27] tree did he say that
[1:04:28] we don't come out of Great Tribulation
[1:04:30] people no we don't go into tribulation
[1:04:33] exactly
[1:04:35] everybody totally agree with what I'm
[1:04:36] saying
[1:04:37] now before that it said it'll be
[1:04:39] gathering around her throne that is the
[1:04:41] bride
[1:04:42] it says Great Tribulation
[1:04:45] and brother and we use that two ways and
[1:04:46] I'm going to explain why and this
[1:04:48] scripture is a character of the church
[1:04:50] and the bride
[1:04:52] and it's mixed together if you don't
[1:04:54] know how if you don't have a revelation
[1:04:55] you'll never figure that out and brother
[1:04:57] Brandon did it for us I mean brother
[1:04:59] Wade we're sitting here today I said
[1:05:00] brother Wade who do you think this is in
[1:05:03] seven he said it's the bride brother
[1:05:04] bran said it was a church but he also
[1:05:06] said in the bride in the church age
[1:05:08] seven seal he said it was the church or
[1:05:10] the church
[1:05:12] right and in the end of the church age
[1:05:14] he said it's a bride but the
[1:05:16] characteristic the bride don't go
[1:05:17] through tribulation right right there's
[1:05:19] where you got to stop this you
[1:05:21] understand is she around the throne day
[1:05:23] and night serving him
[1:05:25] that's the characteristic of Bride
[1:05:28] so look between the six and seven see
[1:05:30] there's there's two entities that are
[1:05:31] going to come out there redeemed the the
[1:05:33] good version the wise virgin and the
[1:05:36] foolish virgin and 144 000. so brother
[1:05:39] Raymond that one passage of scripture so
[1:05:41] is the church and the bride and I have
[1:05:43] no problem with that right if you use it
[1:05:46] either way as long as you explain it if
[1:05:49] you say I go through Great Tribulation I
[1:05:50] can show you quote after quote where I
[1:05:52] don't right
[1:05:54] where if I'm gathered around the throat
[1:05:56] servant he might show you quote after
[1:05:57] quote where I am there
[1:05:59] does everybody got what I'm saying it
[1:06:01] might be different once you heard it I'm
[1:06:02] gonna read the two quotes and you'll see
[1:06:04] what I'm saying
[1:06:05] therefore they are Before the Throne of
[1:06:07] God serving day and night in this Temple
[1:06:08] they shall hunger no more never thirst
[1:06:10] anymore neither shall the sun light on
[1:06:12] them nor any heat for the lamb which is
[1:06:15] in the midst of the throne shall feed
[1:06:16] them shall lead them into ever to let
[1:06:18] unto living Fountains of waters and God
[1:06:20] shall wipe away all the tears from your
[1:06:22] eyes look here we go okay
[1:06:25] I'll start down here I gotta I gotta get
[1:06:28] where I'm getting going here are these
[1:06:29] why which are red and white robes and
[1:06:31] when it's coming south they this is
[1:06:33] under the seven seal by the way
[1:06:35] okay who are these which are red and
[1:06:38] white robes and which cometh they John
[1:06:40] answering now and I said it to him sir I
[1:06:42] know it's John didn't know them see all
[1:06:44] kindreds tongues and Nations and he said
[1:06:46] unto me these are he said unto me uh
[1:06:49] these are they which came out a Great
[1:06:51] Tribulation
[1:06:52] see where he puts it Great Tribulation
[1:06:54] right
[1:06:55] in other words Great Tribulation and
[1:06:57] have washed their robes made them white
[1:06:59] in the blood of the Lamb therefore they
[1:07:01] are Before the Throne of God set him day
[1:07:02] and night brother Abel is on but we know
[1:07:05] that you know by and they had set up on
[1:07:08] the throat shall dwell among them they
[1:07:09] shall hunger no more neither shall they
[1:07:11] thirst anymore uh let me go to that for
[1:07:13] the lamb which is in the midst of the
[1:07:14] throne shall feed them shall lead them
[1:07:16] going down I'm just reading scripture
[1:07:17] now okay let's go to the next quote
[1:07:19] let's see yeah now we open to get to the
[1:07:22] seal and did you notice there first
[1:07:23] start Israel and we see the purge church
[1:07:26] not the bride right
[1:07:28] is that what he said
[1:07:30] I didn't say it he said it he says
[1:07:33] that's the church did I just read it
[1:07:36] yeah okay
[1:07:37] come over here great number of real
[1:07:38] sincere hearts that came up out of the
[1:07:40] Great Tribulation not the church it's
[1:07:42] gone on the bride
[1:07:44] there's the church
[1:07:46] he says the bride don't go through
[1:07:48] tribulation that's what he said over and
[1:07:49] over
[1:07:51] okay right you agree with what I'm
[1:07:52] saying now let's read what it says in
[1:07:54] the church age book
[1:07:56] he says God talking about the bride here
[1:07:58] do you want to see another picture of
[1:07:59] her is over in Revelation 7 4 17. right
[1:08:02] so he calls it the church up here right
[1:08:05] he's told it's a bride here there's
[1:08:07] characteristics of both of them in there
[1:08:09] that's why you you got to take the
[1:08:12] characters of the Bride out of there
[1:08:13] she's around his throne day and night
[1:08:15] those that come up under tribulation are
[1:08:18] going to be outside of the city the only
[1:08:20] ones that's going to be in that pyramid
[1:08:21] City the ones that got the Holy Ghost
[1:08:23] right they ain't going to stand before
[1:08:24] him day and night are they exactly those
[1:08:26] tribulations say he's going to stand
[1:08:28] before God day and night it's only the
[1:08:29] bride but we don't go through Great
[1:08:31] Tribulation so you got to look at this
[1:08:33] scripture and you can have a revelation
[1:08:34] what he's talking about right
[1:08:37] and he uses it both ways because it if
[1:08:40] you want to talk about the church I can
[1:08:41] use that to a portion
[1:08:43] if I'm talking about the bride I can use
[1:08:46] that to a portion right and brother
[1:08:48] Branham does that does everybody agree
[1:08:50] with me because if I would have called
[1:08:52] her the one which I want to type it with
[1:08:55] what I'm doing
[1:08:56] as The Purge Saints it goes through
[1:08:58] tribulation
[1:08:59] okay but you can use it either way
[1:09:02] I know it's been a lot of time on that
[1:09:04] but it'll confuse you if I don't explain
[1:09:05] it I don't leave him with a bunch of
[1:09:07] questions let's go let's go
[1:09:09] okay go up go up okay that's okay but it
[1:09:13] says you see the 12 tribes it mentions
[1:09:14] that you're reading down going up where
[1:09:16] it's highlighted no down down I'm sorry
[1:09:18] I'm going the wrong way
[1:09:20] down down there we go who are they these
[1:09:23] are the bride right one place he says
[1:09:25] it's the church another seven seal of
[1:09:28] the church agency says it's the bride
[1:09:29] right
[1:09:30] so you gotta say am I going to argue a
[1:09:33] quote with a quote do I look stupid
[1:09:35] don't answer that
[1:09:38] I really get disgusted with ministers
[1:09:40] that argue a quote with a globe the
[1:09:42] reason you're arguing it you don't you
[1:09:43] don't have a revelation what he said
[1:09:46] everybody got what I'm saying that's the
[1:09:48] problem we have around
[1:09:49] they don't really understand they say
[1:09:51] well he changed his mind on Daniel
[1:09:52] Saturday no he didn't he said three and
[1:09:54] a half years he's talking in the seals
[1:09:55] of the seven of the of the Messiah week
[1:09:58] if I say it a different way the son of
[1:10:00] man Ministry
[1:10:01] the Messiah week is the son of man
[1:10:03] Ministry it's a seven year Ministry it's
[1:10:06] God complete in three and a half
[1:10:11] answer me
[1:10:14] he's perfect in three
[1:10:16] he's completing seven
[1:10:18] right you three and a half is not on
[1:10:20] either of them folks so you got you got
[1:10:22] to get your types right brother I said
[1:10:24] whatever you do get your threes and
[1:10:25] sevens right right
[1:10:26] okay
[1:10:28] so they serve me to Temple they are the
[1:10:30] special care Lord they are his bride
[1:10:31] blows your weight on it go up next quote
[1:10:34] the bride goes wherever the bridegroom
[1:10:36] is she will never she will never be left
[1:10:38] by well he'll left by him she will learn
[1:10:41] never leave aside see in the portion
[1:10:43] he's taken with him he's not staying
[1:10:45] we're going through Great Tribulation he
[1:10:47] reads the scripture but he doesn't say
[1:10:49] we're going through great we're not
[1:10:50] right come on people
[1:10:52] she will never be left by him she will
[1:10:54] never leave aside she will share the
[1:10:56] throne with him she will be crowned with
[1:10:57] his glory and honor
[1:11:00] brother Ram typed it both ways
[1:11:02] how many knows he taught Noah as the
[1:11:04] people that went over tribulation and as
[1:11:06] the raptured Saints
[1:11:07] you know what brother Graham did here
[1:11:09] did he do what Noah did
[1:11:11] it's no different check it out see what
[1:11:13] he's saying okay let's go now one thing
[1:11:16] I'm gonna I'm gonna interject here
[1:11:18] remember he said under Daniel if you
[1:11:19] don't understand it you don't get three
[1:11:20] woes
[1:11:21] do you say it right you're gonna be at
[1:11:23] the seven vials you're not going to get
[1:11:24] seven trumpets
[1:11:25] did he say it I read it to you all
[1:11:28] you're not going to get them
[1:11:29] you'll never get them
[1:11:31] three woes Revelation 8 13. now I've
[1:11:34] been held and heard an Angel flying
[1:11:35] through the midst of Heaven saying with
[1:11:36] loud voice whoa whoa whoa to the inhabit
[1:11:38] reserved by reason of the other voices
[1:11:40] of The Trumpet of the Three Angels which
[1:11:41] are yet to sound right right
[1:11:45] now this is the third Angel's message to
[1:11:47] the world and you know what the third
[1:11:49] Angel's message is going forth now in
[1:11:51] this day
[1:11:51] what he said this is the flying of the
[1:11:53] third Angel message if you're a Bible
[1:11:55] read there was three woes followed it
[1:11:57] the first one happened in World War One
[1:12:02] okay second one happened in World War II
[1:12:05] right
[1:12:07] right see what we're going in now all
[1:12:08] right we're at the end of the row which
[1:12:10] is the last World War
[1:12:12] Armageddon right
[1:12:14] right we have never had a World War
[1:12:16] since World War II the battle of
[1:12:18] Armageddon is going to take the world to
[1:12:20] the Gates of Jerusalem
[1:12:22] that's going to be your third woe in
[1:12:24] your third world war does everybody
[1:12:25] understand that
[1:12:26] he said it I didn't
[1:12:29] know okay it's important you understand
[1:12:31] the woes because if you don't place them
[1:12:33] right you won't see where the trumpets
[1:12:34] are right

[1:12:55] given the key of the bottomless pit
[1:12:58] and he opened the bottom of his Pit and
[1:13:00] the rose the smoke out of the pit as the
[1:13:02] smoke of a great furnace to the sun in

[1:15:23] thinking right
[1:15:24] brother Ram's a part of the seventh
[1:15:26] seals so are you
[1:15:27] sure
[1:15:28] see it's like he said yesterday if you
[1:15:31] don't take this and make it personal to
[1:15:33] you right if every scripture in there
[1:15:35] don't talk to your heart if you don't
[1:15:37] you don't see yourself in a word like
[1:15:39] Jesus saw himself in the word he said
[1:15:41] destroy the temple I'll raise it up in
[1:15:42] three days exactly sure
[1:15:44] because he's seen songs where it said
[1:15:46] I'll not suffer my Holy One to see
[1:15:48] corruption in three days your body
[1:15:49] starts corrupting he never seen
[1:15:51] corruption you know why he didn't see
[1:15:52] corruption because there was no sin in
[1:15:54] him God had to bring him out before he
[1:15:56] started decaying right or it would have
[1:15:57] been a leavening effect on that body
[1:15:59] just gonna be honest with you guys
[1:16:01] that's why I preached 11.
[1:16:05] okay so these scorpions come out are
[1:16:07] locust on the earth unto them was power
[1:16:10] given as the Scorpions of the Earth have
[1:16:12] power what does Scorpions on the earth
[1:16:13] do they sting you they torment you man
[1:16:17] they'll hurt you some of them will kill
[1:16:18] you
[1:16:19] come on
[1:16:22] 9-4 and it was commanded them that they
[1:16:25] should not hurt the grass or of the
[1:16:27] earth look the first four couldn't hurt
[1:16:29] interrupt nature could it no it it told
[1:16:33] him don't you do that right so this boy
[1:16:35] said I'm Gonna Let You Out Mr Locust but
[1:16:37] you don't hurt the grass last time I
[1:16:39] checked if it was a locust like a little
[1:16:41] fly it eats everybody seen a locust
[1:16:44] plague
[1:16:45] well you won't have grass left on the
[1:16:46] ground when they come through will you
[1:16:48] anybody ever seen them before there was
[1:16:50] one in Nebraska in the early 1900s I'd
[1:16:53] seen a picture of it man they wiped
[1:16:55] every there wasn't a green thing left on
[1:16:56] a tree there wasn't a green thing left
[1:16:58] nowhere you know what brother Brown said
[1:17:01] the leaves are
[1:17:02] that the Locust leaves off the tree do
[1:17:04] you know what he said that was
[1:17:08] these locusts that come out are eating a
[1:17:11] fellowship off the Nations there ain't
[1:17:13] no Nation can agree now we spy on it
[1:17:16] Britain they spy on us and they're our
[1:17:18] friends
[1:17:21] you don't have any Fellowship among the
[1:17:23] Nations come on who are you kidding
[1:17:24] great business Great Rentals sell you
[1:17:27] out tomorrow if it did them good
[1:17:30] since these locusts have let out they
[1:17:33] tried to form a United Nations in the
[1:17:35] early 1900s and couldn't do it and they
[1:17:38] got that stupid one set up in New York
[1:17:39] that we pay for they don't even agree
[1:17:42] then two of them can agree on anything
[1:17:44] yeah that's a jazz a facade that's a
[1:17:47] joke but what is it these locusts are
[1:17:49] coming out they've ate the fellowship
[1:17:51] you can't have Fellowship anywhere we
[1:17:53] can't Fellowship other message churches
[1:17:55] don't tell me these locals saying here
[1:17:57] eating the greens off the tree
[1:17:59] you tell them what you believe that when
[1:18:01] he fellowshift you don't
[1:18:03] like Christ
[1:18:04] they'll chew the they'll chew the leaves
[1:18:06] right off your tree
[1:18:08] waltay you know you've had I've had mine
[1:18:12] ate more than once oh yeah
[1:18:14] a committee that should not hurt the
[1:18:16] grass of the earth neither any green
[1:18:18] thing neither any tree I said read
[1:18:20] Revelation 7 1-3 what it says stop don't
[1:18:23] you interrupt nature yet right right
[1:18:25] it's going to come but I'm going to stop
[1:18:27] you first four because I got 144 000 to
[1:18:30] seal I got a purge
[1:18:33] see what I'm saying
[1:18:34] it's afterwards you know I gotta Purge
[1:18:36] the rest everybody understand okay here
[1:18:38] we go
[1:18:40] but those but only those men which have
[1:18:43] not the Seal of God in their foreheads
[1:18:46] right okay
[1:18:48] and to them it was given that they
[1:18:49] should not kill them but that they
[1:18:51] should be tormented they're tormentors
[1:18:54] they're tormentors that's been led up
[1:18:56] out of the bottomless pit just to be
[1:18:58] honest with you
[1:18:59] okay
[1:19:01] and to them is get tormented five months
[1:19:03] and their torment was as a torment of a
[1:19:05] scorpion right remember brother man said
[1:19:07] it'd be locusts it looked like Locust
[1:19:09] they have a stinger like a scorpion
[1:19:11] remember he said that this is where he's
[1:19:12] getting it
[1:19:13] when he strikes a man and in those days
[1:19:16] shall men seek death and shall not find
[1:19:18] it and shall desire to die and Death
[1:19:20] Shall Not shall flee from them right
[1:19:24] the shape of the locusts were likened to
[1:19:26] horses prepared unto battle isn't that
[1:19:29] something
[1:19:30] and on their heads whereas were crowns
[1:19:31] like golden their faces where the faces
[1:19:33] of men they had hair as the hair of
[1:19:35] women
[1:19:39] and her teeth wears the teeth of lions
[1:19:41] and they had breastplates that were
[1:19:42] breastplates of iron and the sound of
[1:19:44] their wings was as the sound of Chariots
[1:19:46] and many horses running to battle I'm
[1:19:48] going to tell you something if you ever
[1:19:49] I don't know how your church is you ever
[1:19:51] see one family or one person at church
[1:19:53] every time there's a battle they run to
[1:19:54] it they got to get involved in it
[1:19:58] there's something wrong with your spirit
[1:19:59] when you do that
[1:20:02] brother Adam said if something comes
[1:20:03] into the church you stay neutral on it
[1:20:05] right do you know brother Ram said that
[1:20:07] guys
[1:20:07] is that what he said somebody comes in
[1:20:10] here starts bad-mouthing him you're
[1:20:11] supposed to keep your mouth shut right
[1:20:13] they say you say that's what you think
[1:20:14] it ain't what I think right
[1:20:17] you're supposed to not go but if you run
[1:20:19] to that battle right then you become a
[1:20:22] part of the battle you're a part of the
[1:20:23] mass then right if you know a pastor's
[1:20:25] supposed to get between the two parties
[1:20:26] and bring them to a resolution
[1:20:28] but what people want to do in the church
[1:20:30] well I don't think brother Samuel's
[1:20:32] doing it right
[1:20:34] right they didn't put you in God did
[1:20:36] right
[1:20:37] if God don't want you he'll take you out
[1:20:39] if there's seed here and he's going to
[1:20:41] injure it God will take him out right
[1:20:43] sure God will take him home early you
[1:20:45] believe that right amen all right
[1:20:48] you go here you don't like the way you
[1:20:49] run it I don't like who he preaches I
[1:20:51] don't like the way shut up right
[1:20:54] every time something comes up at the
[1:20:56] church you're ready to take sides with
[1:20:58] it
[1:21:00] quit running the battle
[1:21:03] they had tails like little scorpions
[1:21:04] they were stings in their tails and her
[1:21:06] power was to hurt me in five months I
[1:21:08] said it's a season of Torment
[1:21:11] listen to this fella they had a key over
[1:21:13] there which is the Angel of the bottom
[1:21:14] spit who's naming the Hebrew tongue is
[1:21:16] Abaddon but in a Greek tank his name is
[1:21:18] apollyon do you know what it means
[1:21:20] Destroyer
[1:21:21] you know who was laying out of the
[1:21:23] bottle was fit under the fifth trumpet
[1:21:26] the Destroyer
[1:21:29] under the fifth throne but somebody come
[1:21:30] was released out of the bottomless pit
[1:21:33] and he was over those locusts
[1:21:36] you know what his job is to cause
[1:21:37] Discord among the brothers
[1:21:45] let's read the quotes right Revelation 9
[1:21:47] 1 or the fifth drop of 13. notice
[1:21:49] Revelation uh
[1:21:52] moved down it's often what you think now
[1:21:55] the king of this great group of two
[1:21:56] hundred thousand and now brother Branham
[1:21:58] introduces in the sixth trumpet but he's
[1:22:00] talking about the fifth trumpet
[1:22:02] okay so under the fifth trumpet this bad
[1:22:05] guy
[1:22:06] the Destroyer comes out of the
[1:22:07] bottomless pit and with him he's got
[1:22:09] locusts that are going to torment to
[1:22:11] women
[1:22:12] now brother Brad is going to Brother
[1:22:13] Brad was going to interpret this he's a
[1:22:15] Divine interpreter when I start
[1:22:17] interpreting you'll know exactly you've
[1:22:18] heard the quotes I want to tie it up for
[1:22:20] you okay
[1:22:21] okay they had a king over them and if we
[1:22:23] noticed it was a fallen story why out
[1:22:24] there falling manual Lucifer oh how Dr
[1:22:26] Smith got that so scruple up there but
[1:22:28] it's all right see was it for his hour
[1:22:31] all right was the bottomless pit their
[1:22:33] King was the king of the bottomless pit
[1:22:34] he come out
[1:22:36] I'm going to show you I can almost place
[1:22:38] the timing come out
[1:22:40] well I'm gonna show you it'll measure
[1:22:43] when you read it when you see it
[1:22:44] Revelation say 10 I wrote something down
[1:22:46] here I'm just going to read it you see
[1:22:48] here Revelation 17 8 I want to read what
[1:22:50] it says there because I don't know just
[1:22:52] how I hit how to hit the next 17A and
[1:22:55] the Beast without sauce was is not and
[1:22:57] shall Ascend on the bottom of his pit
[1:22:58] and shall go into Perdition right he's
[1:23:01] out of the bottom of this pit and he's
[1:23:02] going to go all the way to the end now
[1:23:04] the fifth trumpet was opened up in the
[1:23:06] early 1900s I'm going to prove it in a
[1:23:08] minute I can prove what I'm saying and
[1:23:10] it's not going to stop until he goes
[1:23:12] into perdition
[1:23:13] the first four trumpets have it sounded
[1:23:15] because that angel said don't do it
[1:23:17] until I seal them
[1:23:19] the acorn Rider stopped him from
[1:23:21] destroying Jerusalem until they could
[1:23:22] steal those Jews until they escaped am I
[1:23:24] telling you the truth or am I am the
[1:23:27] same thing's Happening Here God's not
[1:23:28] going to let him destroy that until it
[1:23:30] was 144 000 get sealed right if he'd let
[1:23:33] them first four trumpets go they
[1:23:34] destroyed just about everything
[1:23:37] does everybody understand what I'm
[1:23:38] saying
[1:23:39] so he's not going to let that happen
[1:23:41] until those 144 000 get sealed right
[1:23:44] everybody okay is what I'm talking about
[1:23:48] dwell upon the Earth shall wonder whose
[1:23:50] names were not written in the Book of
[1:23:51] Life for the life from the foundation of
[1:23:52] the world whether they beheld the Beast
[1:23:54] which was which is not and which yet is
[1:23:56] right next quote
[1:23:59] and they made their first organization
[1:24:01] huh
[1:24:03] and that was the Catholic Church God's
[1:24:05] Church never was organized until
[1:24:06] Catholicism and then it was a forcing
[1:24:08] that you had to do it or they pulled
[1:24:10] them apart with ox
[1:24:14] they burned them they fed them lines
[1:24:16] they've done everything and they forced
[1:24:18] in a false Unity the locusts began to
[1:24:21] sting
[1:24:22] brother Branham is interpreting what
[1:24:23] those locusts are for us
[1:24:25] a false Unity is the sting of those
[1:24:28] locusts
[1:24:35] God help me I know people are going to
[1:24:36] see this and I'm not critical does
[1:24:38] everybody understand what I'm saying
[1:24:40] right
[1:24:41] what happened when this come in the
[1:24:43] first time can I say that under
[1:24:45] Constantine he called them all together
[1:24:46] all the ministers to come together we're
[1:24:49] going to come under the unity of the
[1:24:50] faith and it looks like a beautiful it
[1:24:52] sounds good don't it that does it sound
[1:24:54] pretty they were out there first some of
[1:24:56] them were killing each other Kirsten
[1:24:57] were killing Christians over Doctrine
[1:24:58] well that sounds familiar yeah said if
[1:25:01] you kill a man's influence killed a man
[1:25:03] exactly that happens around the message
[1:25:05] Daniel 30 weeks you're wrong bam don't
[1:25:08] listen to brother Claude shoot you in
[1:25:10] the back
[1:25:12] yeah yeah they do it yeah
[1:25:14] but they do it under the pretense it's
[1:25:16] the unity of the faith brother man said
[1:25:18] they won't prophets they should have
[1:25:19] never went there did he say it they
[1:25:21] should have never went there exactly
[1:25:23] because it was a false Unity they were
[1:25:24] going to get stung right
[1:25:26] everybody understand that some of them
[1:25:28] actually went into that and they didn't
[1:25:29] want to go into it because they went to
[1:25:31] it a lot of these preachers made it you
[1:25:33] know the number one thing they preach
[1:25:35] you need the faith do I believe in unity
[1:25:38] the faith yeah if it's with the word
[1:25:41] if it ain't with the word I'm not going
[1:25:43] to get hide under that remember
[1:25:44] unleavened bread God ain't gonna put his
[1:25:46] name on something it's got levny in it
[1:25:47] right you mean I got to have Unity of
[1:25:49] the faith the word yes that's where
[1:25:52] God's going to meet you
[1:25:53] he's not going to meet you under a false
[1:25:55] pretense or a false Unity what's going
[1:25:58] on around the message there's a false
[1:26:00] Unity going on right that thing started
[1:26:02] in the early 1900s and I'm going to
[1:26:04] prove it by history here in a minute
[1:26:09] it's too bad after the caliper got into
[1:26:11] the Pentecostal church and broke up the
[1:26:12] Brotherhood see what they do
[1:26:14] you know there's certain churches where
[1:26:16] a daughter goes over this church her
[1:26:18] days of Pastor he's a deacon over here
[1:26:20] you can't go visit her because they
[1:26:22] don't believe like I do
[1:26:26] I mean a monkey treats his babies better
[1:26:28] than that
[1:26:31] obviously I I thought we were human I
[1:26:33] thought we were the highest form a
[1:26:35] monkey won't desert their baby if you
[1:26:37] had a daughter that was over in a church
[1:26:39] at Peach two Lords would you still fell
[1:26:40] a shipper Brother Ray would you
[1:26:43] well you ought to
[1:26:45] you if you're not you're no better than
[1:26:47] a monkey
[1:26:49] I won't be I know that sounds funny but
[1:26:51] it's a monkey will leave his own they'll
[1:26:53] take care and they'll feed him bananas
[1:26:54] but we oh you don't believe it just like
[1:26:57] I do you're out
[1:26:59] I don't know it all
[1:27:01] but I will say what I know is thus saith
[1:27:03] the Lord and you're not right I'll tell
[1:27:05] you you're not right but I'm not going
[1:27:07] to draw you out
[1:27:10] you know what they tell us well I'm
[1:27:12] gonna draw you back in because I don't
[1:27:13] agree with them they get up and slam you
[1:27:15] for what you just preached they're not
[1:27:17] drawing you in they're drawing you out
[1:27:18] knucklehead
[1:27:21] let's read it Council of churches
[1:27:24] in the more modern times John Ardmore
[1:27:26] organized in 1910 does that sound
[1:27:28] familiar the fifth trumpet was open I'm
[1:27:30] going to tell you when it was over I can
[1:27:32] place it by the whoa he said if you
[1:27:34] don't get Daniel 70 weeks right you
[1:27:35] won't get the woes you won't get the
[1:27:37] plagues which are the Feast of the
[1:27:38] trumpets you won't get the vials you
[1:27:40] won't get the woes is that what he said
[1:27:43] there's a reason he said and it's part
[1:27:45] of the 70th week
[1:27:46] he didn't say the three and a half years
[1:27:48] he said the 70th week what is wrong with
[1:27:51] us
[1:27:54] organized the 19th International
[1:27:55] missionary Conference held in Edinboro
[1:27:57] well attended well attended you get it
[1:28:01] this conference fostered other movements
[1:28:03] out of its spring International
[1:28:03] missionary Council of 1921 Bishop
[1:28:06] Charles Brandon the United States
[1:28:07] returned member fired up to create the
[1:28:10] World Conference of faith it started the
[1:28:13] World Council of churches they didn't
[1:28:15] become founded until 1948 but the spirit
[1:28:19] of that Destroyer came out
[1:28:21] the fifth trumpet is beyond a doubt open
[1:28:24] oh yeah and I'm going to give you in the
[1:28:26] mouth of two or three Witnesses it'll be
[1:28:27] a stab this is one I can prove it what
[1:28:31] did Brother man say their stinger was
[1:28:32] false Unity what are they starting to
[1:28:35] bring in the early 1900s false Unity
[1:28:38] exactly
[1:28:39] how can two walk together unless they be
[1:28:41] agreed
[1:28:43] now brother we want to have Unity under
[1:28:45] the faith we can't even agree on
[1:28:46] Daniel's 70 weeks
[1:28:48] we're going to have Unity the faith and
[1:28:49] you believe it one way and I believe it
[1:28:51] or not but we're going to have Unity the
[1:28:52] faith am I stupid I feel like Tom do I
[1:28:55] have stupid road on my forehead

[1:33:42] named after the celebrated Ballroom
[1:33:43] dancer Irene Castle while cutting your

[1:33:47] know that she would forever be
[1:33:48] associated with triggering a revolution

[1:34:06] staying if there's false Unity he gets
[1:34:08] stung if you Bob your hair you get stung
[1:34:11] if you cut off any messenger you'll get
[1:34:13] stung right
[1:34:14] brother babe said I said what Paul said
[1:34:16] brother M didn't cut him off right right
[1:34:18] or he had a right for torment if you cut
[1:34:21] off any of those seven Church age
[1:34:22] Messengers message you're going to get
[1:34:24] stung you're cutting your hair because
[1:34:26] your hair is recovering
[1:34:28] is that right brother
[1:34:32] okay go up I got it highlighted ones I
[1:34:35] want or Go Down Nutrition right this was
[1:34:39] and then more warrant started does
[1:34:40] everybody understand that so the bobbing
[1:34:43] of hair the false Unity started before
[1:34:45] World War One what did Brotherhood say
[1:34:47] the first war was
[1:34:50] World War one was what the first woe did
[1:34:53] he say it remember I read the quote
[1:34:55] now the first world war one started
[1:34:58] the first woe listen
[1:35:01] the attrition rate nutrients has left
[1:35:03] you with hope that they would survive
[1:35:04] long enough to return home they found
[1:35:06] themselves inflicted with it eat drink
[1:35:08] and die and be merry for tomorrow we die
[1:35:10] there was no hope for them men in
[1:35:12] trenches one day the British ran 50 000
[1:35:15] men into machine guns and mowed them
[1:35:17] down fifty thousand remember it said the
[1:35:19] men would have no hope
[1:35:21] yeah that's what it's talking about
[1:35:23] under that fifth trumpet they had no
[1:35:25] hope
[1:35:27] they mowed them down they would take in
[1:35:30] World War One there was nothing one the
[1:35:32] other one thing
[1:35:34] they'd get up say charge remember
[1:35:37] uh uh 50 000 and one day they'd mow down
[1:35:40] they said in one day there was like a
[1:35:43] hundred thousand artillery rounds fired
[1:35:45] where you couldn't put your hand down
[1:35:46] and hit they said they don't know how
[1:35:47] anybody survived it they would charge
[1:35:50] and they'd just mow them down so those
[1:35:52] men that were in those Treasures had no
[1:35:54] hope whatsoever they could care live or
[1:35:56] die you know I don't care anymore have
[1:35:59] anybody ever seen pictures of they say
[1:36:01] the war without hope
[1:36:03] well that's what it's taught under the
[1:36:05] go read the fifth trumpet again I know I
[1:36:06] read it fast but it says they'd have no
[1:36:09] hope right
[1:36:10] I mean you know falling them out and
[1:36:11] said I don't care I just kick me I let
[1:36:13] him shoot me I don't care I'm tired of
[1:36:15] this I've spent four years in this
[1:36:16] stupid hole hardly got enough food to
[1:36:19] eat they'll one day you charge you take
[1:36:21] that trench they'll charge and take it
[1:36:23] back World War one we didn't win one
[1:36:25] piece of real estate other than one and
[1:36:27] I preached that here the only thing they
[1:36:30] got in World War one was Jerusalem
[1:36:33] Jerusalem came out the British defeated
[1:36:36] the Ottoman Empire and pushed them out
[1:36:38] of Jerusalem the whole purpose of World
[1:36:40] War One
[1:36:42] is now we got Jerusalem in World War One
[1:36:45] into Christian hands and the British
[1:36:47] would eventually give it back to the
[1:36:49] Jews
[1:36:51] the only thing accomplished in World War
[1:36:53] one was the retaking of Israel right go
[1:36:56] see it right right go up to the next
[1:36:59] highlight and underline go here you go
[1:37:01] however they're going to get mad at me
[1:37:03] back there they've done a good job
[1:37:04] however nearly a whole generation of
[1:37:06] young men had died in the war remember
[1:37:08] the scripture says that seven women take
[1:37:10] a whole one man
[1:37:12] there's a lot of things come out of War
[1:37:14] there's there's out of that fifth
[1:37:16] trumpet there's that Destroyer that come
[1:37:18] out and people's lives are starting to
[1:37:20] change drastically after that okay
[1:37:22] however nearly a whole generation young
[1:37:24] men had died in the war leaving nearly a
[1:37:26] whole generation of young women without
[1:37:27] possible suitors sounds like a message
[1:37:30] believer most of these women in a
[1:37:32] message Church they think first guy that
[1:37:33] comes along boy if this guy don't take
[1:37:35] me out another one won't come along and
[1:37:36] want me
[1:37:38] what is wrong with you girls
[1:37:40] so the prettiest guy girls I've seen in
[1:37:42] a message Church ain't all made up they
[1:37:43] get what they're looking at they like
[1:37:45] you go out there and she's all painted
[1:37:47] up

[1:37:54] call it coyote
[1:37:56] you know what a coyote he does if he
[1:37:57] gets his leg in a trap he'll chew his
[1:37:59] arm off to get away from it we call her
[1:38:01] Miss coyote sometimes you wake up beside
[1:38:03] a woman chew your arm off to get away
[1:38:04] from her
[1:38:05] what she takes all of her makeup off
[1:38:07] it's oh my Lord it ain't what I thought
[1:38:09] it was we used we used to sell you so
[1:38:12] miss coyote you're laughing but it's the
[1:38:15] truth

[1:38:17] painted up you don't know what you're
[1:38:19] getting
[1:38:20] right you know that I'm gonna tell a
[1:38:21] joke to lighten it up a little remember
[1:38:23] they lost that uh who was it the the
[1:38:26] oh the guy the mobster Jimmy Hoffa yeah
[1:38:29] they say they finally found Jimmy Hoffa
[1:38:32] underneath Tammy Faye's makeup
[1:38:35] it's about the truth isn't it
[1:38:38] you don't know what you're getting
[1:38:39] that's the point right
[1:38:41] I'm gonna read some quotes here in a
[1:38:43] minute you think this ain't funny this
[1:38:45] is a spirit that struck the land right
[1:38:47] and you'll fall into that if you're not
[1:38:49] careful sisters right
[1:38:51] the flapper let's go go up to where my
[1:38:54] highlights are
[1:38:55] go up go up here we go here we go in
[1:38:57] America flapper has always been a giddy
[1:38:59] attractive and slightly unconventional
[1:39:00] Young Thing who an H.L mention's words
[1:39:03] was a somewhat foolish girl full of wild
[1:39:05] surmisis and inclined to revolt against
[1:39:08] the precepts and admonitions of her
[1:39:09] Elders does that sound familiar people
[1:39:11] some of you don't have kids here yeah
[1:39:16] Flappers had both an image and an
[1:39:18] attitude
[1:39:19] brother hemp say if your mother's a
[1:39:21] flapper you'll be a flapper daughter
[1:39:22] will be a flapper you know he said that
[1:39:24] okay
[1:39:25] the flappers image consistently drastic
[1:39:27] to some shocking changes women's
[1:39:28] clothing and hair
[1:39:30] nearly every article of clothing was
[1:39:32] trimmed down enlightened in order to
[1:39:33] make movement easier not only did she
[1:39:35] cut her hair she started trimming her
[1:39:36] dress off yeah her sleeves off I've seen
[1:39:40] some sisters and met you raise your arms
[1:39:41] up I can see all the way through your
[1:39:42] blouse something wrong brother man said
[1:39:45] you're not supposed to be able to see
[1:39:46] your underneath clothes did you know he
[1:39:47] said that she's supposed to be modestly
[1:39:50] apparel
[1:39:53] if you don't bleach your clothesline
[1:39:55] you're not preaching the message
[1:39:57] you know we would we want to get all
[1:39:58] this Revelation when we do the little
[1:40:00] things
[1:40:01] come on people let's go go down
[1:40:05] okay Flappers always started wearing
[1:40:07] makeup oh
[1:40:09] something that had previously been only
[1:40:11] worn by loose women
[1:40:12] Rouge powder eyeliner lipstick become
[1:40:15] extremely popular quote I said how can I
[1:40:18] teach him algebra when they won't learn
[1:40:19] their ABCs
[1:40:21] you know what algebra is it's putting
[1:40:23] the algebra's uh Arabic word that means
[1:40:26] putting the pieces together how are you
[1:40:27] going to put all these Revelations
[1:40:28] together when you can't even do that you
[1:40:30] can't even dress right you can't even
[1:40:32] talk right you can't even walk right you
[1:40:34] think God's going to give you these
[1:40:35] greater Revelations you you might have
[1:40:36] it in between your ears but if it ain't
[1:40:38] made flesh it ain't become a revelation
[1:40:40] yeah
[1:40:40] I'm gonna be honest I feel that way if
[1:40:42] you don't live it you don't believe it
[1:40:44] if honestly like my past years if you've
[1:40:47] got a revelation smoking's wrong how
[1:40:48] could you ever smoke another cigarette
[1:40:49] right if you had a revelation that's
[1:40:51] wrong you'd lay them down right
[1:40:53] right wouldn't you even if it killed you
[1:40:55] you say I'm quitting this it ain't right
[1:40:57] all right okay so you see certainly how
[1:40:59] can you do it such a conglomeration to
[1:41:02] see it the mark of it shows anyone knows
[1:41:04] that pain is a heathen Drake whoops I'm
[1:41:06] a missionary heathens paint
[1:41:09] the Indians painted their faces here in
[1:41:11] Arizona before they knowed God they ever
[1:41:13] know God you don't have to tell them no
[1:41:15] more about it they'll take it off right
[1:41:18] we got people sending the message still
[1:41:20] wearing makeup I hear people that say
[1:41:22] well they make up its base
[1:41:25] it's before you put on makeup
[1:41:28] still not the real you you know
[1:41:31] right come on just like I was here one
[1:41:33] time before people say why wear clear
[1:41:35] nail polish brother Ram didn't say a
[1:41:36] color
[1:41:37] he just said polish he didn't say red he
[1:41:41] said well I don't wear red that's
[1:41:42] self-interpretation that's adultery on
[1:41:44] Christ
[1:41:45] he told you not to wear that I'd go in
[1:41:47] my own church and somebody hand me a
[1:41:49] dish and her fingernails be painted I
[1:41:50] almost hated to take the plate out of
[1:41:52] their hands you think I'm being dog
[1:41:54] Maddie no I preach a message and they're
[1:41:56] still doing that stuff brother said I go
[1:41:58] to California I preach it gets worse and
[1:42:00] worse it'll do that right here by the
[1:42:02] preaching of the word you're either
[1:42:03] getting better or worse every service
[1:42:05] you come in is that what he said some of
[1:42:07] you are getting worse and some of you
[1:42:08] will get better when you leave this
[1:42:09] you're not going to stay the same as
[1:42:11] what he said
[1:42:15] shows are at war with God
[1:42:18] if you wear a paint you're at War right
[1:42:19] Indians wore paint when they went to war
[1:42:21] if you wear a paint your own war with
[1:42:23] God
[1:42:24] I didn't say it he did
[1:42:26] when they take it off shows they're at
[1:42:28] peace with God
[1:42:31] flapper attitude let's go down there
[1:42:33] flapper attitude was characterized by
[1:42:35] Stark truthless fast living and sexual
[1:42:37] behavior that's what it everything
[1:42:39] started
[1:42:40] zero in on sex does everybody know this
[1:42:42] Obamacare the major reason it was done
[1:42:45] it's sex they want to pay for abortions
[1:42:48] they want to pay for birth control and
[1:42:51] when you buy Obamacare you're helping
[1:42:53] pay for it
[1:42:55] that's right does everybody understand
[1:42:57] that
[1:42:59] come on it's ridiculous
[1:43:02] Flappers seem to cling to youth as they
[1:43:04] were to leave them at any moment they
[1:43:06] took risks and were Reckless up
[1:43:09] down down
[1:43:11] it's opposite of what you're looking at
[1:43:13] you can read this right here I want to
[1:43:14] say this this I really like this okay
[1:43:17] listen and this is just a guy out in the
[1:43:20] world who wrote this off the internet I
[1:43:21] think it's wonderful listen
[1:43:23] when she cuts her hair look out when
[1:43:25] your wife who has had long hair since
[1:43:26] you've known her suddenly decides one
[1:43:28] day that nice shoulder length bob
[1:43:31] would flatter her more or worse comes
[1:43:33] home out of the blue one day with all of
[1:43:35] her hair hacked off and look out
[1:43:38] this is probably around the time she'll
[1:43:40] stop having sex with you
[1:43:42] I'm just reading what he's saying I'm
[1:43:43] gonna be playing
[1:43:44] to the pure all things are pure by the
[1:43:46] way you know what sometimes I wonder
[1:43:48] when I'm PR we preach serpent seed and
[1:43:50] they look around we got all these little
[1:43:52] kids
[1:43:53] it's like
[1:43:54] you know I mean it's got to be a paradox
[1:43:57] but anyway uh where are we at where are
[1:43:59] we at where do I go
[1:44:00] oh this probably around the time she
[1:44:02] stopped having sex you probably around
[1:44:03] the time she'll start mentioning
[1:44:04] breaking up a divorce at the very least
[1:44:07] you should understand that she is going
[1:44:08] through something very emotional
[1:44:11] very unpleasant and more than likely
[1:44:13] something very much related to you
[1:44:17] when a woman cuts her hair off it's not
[1:44:18] about wanting a cute new look no matter
[1:44:21] what anyone says it's about sheer
[1:44:23] emotional turmoil yeah
[1:44:25] if you don't believe it just look at
[1:44:27] what's been happening in Hollywood
[1:44:28] Nicole Kidman cut all her hair off
[1:44:30] spontaneously and then a month later
[1:44:32] divorce was announced Jennifer Aniston
[1:44:34] hacked off all over here that she was
[1:44:36] famous for immediately after waiting to
[1:44:37] Brett Pitt and later told Vanity Fair
[1:44:40] about the tremendous stress she was
[1:44:42] under during and after the wedding and
[1:44:44] how the first year of the marriage has
[1:44:45] been the hardest of her life
[1:44:47] you looked into the lives of every if
[1:44:50] you look the lives of every celebrity
[1:44:52] who had long hair for a time and then
[1:44:54] slipped it off like Kim Basinger beg
[1:44:56] Ryan among others you would find all
[1:44:59] that luxurious hair grown back as soon
[1:45:01] as the lady was fun was found as soon as
[1:45:04] the lady has found happiness with a new
[1:45:06] love the only mystery here is why more
[1:45:08] people haven't caught on to the shuttle
[1:45:10] but deadly warning sign
[1:45:12] you know what when you let your hair
[1:45:14] grow out women it shows you're in love
[1:45:15] with Jesus Christ you found a new love
[1:45:18] let's just be honest
[1:45:19] if you love Jesus sister you ain't gonna
[1:45:21] cut your hair right because you just
[1:45:23] when you do that you dishonor your
[1:45:25] husband and you dishonor Christ is that
[1:45:28] what the scripture says
[1:45:33] where did I get to right away
[1:45:36] um
[1:45:37] where where did I get to
[1:45:40] oh
[1:45:41] okay but why should this be why should a
[1:45:44] woman's hair have anything to do with
[1:45:45] their emotions cause hair for almost
[1:45:46] everyone represents femininity Beauty
[1:45:48] and sometimes therefore what she thinks
[1:45:50] of herself when you deal with these
[1:45:52] aspects of the woman emotions naturally
[1:45:54] Run High I see the documentary on the
[1:45:56] Jews the women they asked the women they
[1:45:59] had lived through the the uh the uh
[1:46:03] Holocaust they said what's the worst
[1:46:05] thing they've done to you when they cut
[1:46:06] my hair off
[1:46:08] first thing they did was shave them ball
[1:46:10] and send them right
[1:46:11] they asked him what was the worst thing
[1:46:13] that they did to you this is when they
[1:46:15] shaved my hair off it knew you had no

[1:47:47] of those emotions are more closely
[1:47:48] linked to her hair than any other part
[1:47:50] of her isn't that something as any woman
[1:47:53] who seeks out a wig after chemotherapy
[1:47:55] will tell you
[1:47:58] Samson the biblical figure who lost his
[1:48:00] power when does cut off his hair should
[1:48:02] have been written as a woman

[1:48:41] was passed one what was passing behold
[1:48:43] there come two woes more thereafter the
[1:48:45] first one ended at the end of world war
[1:48:46] one right
[1:48:48] that's when that fifth trumpet come out
[1:48:49] right before World War One
[1:48:51] right that's what your Prophet said I'm
[1:48:53] not making this up is that you're saying
[1:48:55] amen so you agree with what I'm saying
[1:48:58] six Angels six trumpet six Angels sound
[1:49:00] I Heard a Voice from four horns at all
[1:49:01] golden altar which is before God saying
[1:49:04] to the sixth Angel which had to trumpet
[1:49:06] loose the Four Angels which are bound to
[1:49:07] greater fear of phrase and the Four
[1:49:09] Angels now these are different Angels
[1:49:11] when you read Revelation you better
[1:49:13] understand what Angel is brother Adam
[1:49:15] said Angel could be a messenger Angel
[1:49:17] could be an Angelic being
[1:49:19] now brother Branham and I'll read the
[1:49:21] quotes in a minute I'm going to say it
[1:49:22] now those four Angels let out of the
[1:49:25] river Euphrates were Eichmann Hitler
[1:49:28] Mussolini and Stalin
[1:49:31] I'm going to tell you ahead of time but
[1:49:33] I you know I can prove that by Pro by
[1:49:35] quote any of you that's read the message
[1:49:37] at all some of you are shaking your head
[1:49:41] loose the Four Angels was bound to the
[1:49:43] great river Euphrates and the Four
[1:49:44] Angels were loosed which were repaired
[1:49:46] prepared for an hour a day a month and a
[1:49:49] year for a certain amount of time these
[1:49:50] angels are going to strike the Earth
[1:49:52] everybody agree with that
[1:49:54] for to slay the third part of men does
[1:49:57] everybody understand six million Jews
[1:49:59] were killed during World War II
[1:50:02] there's only 18 million on the earth a
[1:50:04] third part of the Jews were killed off
[1:50:05] the Earth
[1:50:07] the trumpets are the Jews right yeah
[1:50:10] yeah but God's also going to use plagues
[1:50:11] to get you moving too
[1:50:15] that's what he's doing
[1:50:17] when you come to this message after that
[1:50:19] is everything just a flowery bed of ease
[1:50:22] you come home and there's roses in your
[1:50:24] bed on your pillow and everything's just
[1:50:26] really good I don't know about you some
[1:50:29] of the worst days I've ever had in this
[1:50:30] life is when I've been under in this
[1:50:32] message
[1:50:33] because president said those 200 000 are
[1:50:35] all aimed at the bride remember they're
[1:50:37] spiritual Chargers Supernatural devils
[1:50:41] now look Spirits get off on men
[1:50:44] everybody understand that you take and I
[1:50:46] did it I took the population of Russia
[1:50:49] Germany and Italy it's about 300 million
[1:50:52] do you know people had the spirit so bad
[1:50:54] some of the neighbors of those Jews had
[1:50:56] turned them in
[1:50:59] there were Spirits loud on the people
[1:51:02] and they started persecuting it might
[1:51:03] have been your next door neighbor it
[1:51:05] didn't have to have a Nazi uniform on
[1:51:06] there's many Germans that sold those
[1:51:10] Jews out they had a spirit on them do
[1:51:11] you understand that they persecuted them
[1:51:14] they did in Italy
[1:51:16] Stalin killed a bunch of Jews too folks
[1:51:18] you better go look at your history
[1:51:20] okay right
[1:51:22] you agree how many dollars for 200 000
[1:51:26] 000 and I heard the number of them
[1:51:27] that's 200 million and thus I saw the
[1:51:29] horses in division and them and sat on
[1:51:30] them having breastplates of Fire
[1:51:33] now John didn't see all these modern
[1:51:35] things we got so he described it as the
[1:51:37] best way he could in his hour
[1:51:39] okay my brother Brandon's going to
[1:51:41] interpret it I ain't Brimstone the head
[1:51:43] of the horses whereas the heads of lions
[1:51:44] out of the mouth issued fire smoke and
[1:51:46] brimstone by these three was the third
[1:51:49] part of men killed by the fire by the
[1:51:52] smoke and by the brimstone which issued
[1:51:55] out of their mouth right
[1:51:57] for their powers in their mouth and in
[1:51:59] their tails for their tails were like in
[1:52:01] the serpents and had heads with them
[1:52:04] they did hurt okay well it's 9 20 the
[1:52:07] rest of the men which were not killed by
[1:52:09] these plagues yet repented not right
[1:52:12] the Jew the eight the other 12 million
[1:52:14] Jews that were there they haven't still
[1:52:16] haven't repented
[1:52:18] is that true
[1:52:20] they still haven't repented they're not
[1:52:23] going to be able to until they get them
[1:52:24] two witnesses right let's listen to what
[1:52:26] they did

[1:52:28] hands that they should not worship
[1:52:30] devils and Idols of gold what did them

[1:54:37] Feast of trumpets note in Revelation 9
[1:54:40] Chapter 13 Verse now real close under
[1:54:42] the Sixth trumpet Revelation 9 through
[1:54:45] under the Sixth Trump I know there were
[1:54:46] two a thousand Horsemen that have been
[1:54:47] bound to river Euphrates was turned
[1:54:48] loose under the Sixth trumpet
[1:54:51] now there was not 200 000 Horsemen in
[1:54:54] the world but there was two hundred
[1:54:55] thousand Horsemen notice that I want you
[1:54:58] to jot it down so you can read it they
[1:55:00] wasn't natural horses
[1:55:02] they breathed fire and they had
[1:55:04] breastplates of Jasper and they had
[1:55:05] tails and the end of their tail looked
[1:55:07] like a serpent a snake's head on the end
[1:55:09] of its sting see it was spiritual horses
[1:55:11] spiritual Devils Chargers that had been
[1:55:14] bound and refused all those years
[1:55:15] Supernatural Devils what was it the old
[1:55:18] Roman empire being revived
[1:55:23] and who's over these that guy that was
[1:55:25] let out the bottom of his pit right
[1:55:28] I'm going to tell you what come out and
[1:55:29] I'm going to give you a name I'm gonna
[1:55:30] explain something everybody know what a
[1:55:32] heathen is what heathenism is it's a man
[1:55:34] who don't believe there's God he don't
[1:55:36] believe nothing he does anything he
[1:55:38] wants does anybody know what a pagan is
[1:55:40] he's a heathen that is religious
[1:55:43] that's what a pagan is
[1:55:46] so you know Brethren said the worst
[1:55:47] Devil is a religious devil a paganism is
[1:55:50] worse than Hedonism that's what he's
[1:55:52] really telling you so a pagan is a
[1:55:54] heathen that's religious you know what
[1:55:56] capitalism is it's when he takes him and
[1:55:58] puts them in a system brother said
[1:56:00] papillism is a system
[1:56:03] under that fifth trumpet what started
[1:56:05] where people started
[1:56:06] churches started a
[1:56:08] under the Pentecostal system 50
[1:56:10] denominations come out of it
[1:56:13] false Unity
[1:56:15] is everybody got what I'm saying they
[1:56:17] all say underneath that Pinnacle if you
[1:56:19] speak in tongues you have the bat that
[1:56:21] ain't scripture
[1:56:22] it's a false Unity under false Doctrine
[1:56:26] it can't be true Unity if it's not bound
[1:56:29] on the word
[1:56:30] I am not going to unite with a message
[1:56:33] preacher if he's not preaching 100 of
[1:56:35] the message don't you be unequally yoked
[1:56:38] together is what the scripture says and
[1:56:41] these preachers around the message are
[1:56:42] calling for a Unity how can we have
[1:56:45] Unity if we got five different faiths
[1:56:47] right
[1:56:47] right I see Daniel 70 weeks one way you
[1:56:50] see it the other that ain't Unity
[1:56:52] the only Unity you're going to have is
[1:56:54] if you unite on the word
[1:56:56] there
[1:56:58] okay empire being Riot persecution of
[1:57:00] the Jews they had been bound for nearly
[1:57:02] two thousand years the river Euphrates
[1:57:04] came across to the promise a religious
[1:57:06] set religious Devils right
[1:57:08] they were the worst kind people
[1:57:11] that was trying to get the other side do
[1:57:13] you understand the Germans were one of
[1:57:14] the most Christian nations on the face
[1:57:16] of the earth when this happened
[1:57:17] you know why they killed the Jews what
[1:57:19] they'll tell you because the Jews killed
[1:57:21] Jesus doesn't that sound sweet
[1:57:23] now I don't know about you that sounds
[1:57:25] pretty sweet to me
[1:57:26] they did kill Jesus
[1:57:29] the Romans didn't kill them the Jews did
[1:57:32] pilate said I put him in your hands what
[1:57:35] do you want to do with him they suffered
[1:57:37] a Roman judgment but the Jews had them
[1:57:40] in their heads they could have let him
[1:57:41] go as a nation they cried out and said
[1:57:43] we reject him right
[1:57:45] is that the word
[1:57:48] exactly okay and the Germans were right
[1:57:50] Luther do you know Luther the messenger
[1:57:52] said that the Jews were Antichrist
[1:57:56] you know who most Germans were Catholics
[1:57:58] and lutherans
[1:58:00] kind of easy for him killing Jews off
[1:58:02] you know they killed our savior
[1:58:05] looks real sweet almost like this Unity
[1:58:07] the faith they're preaching now it looks
[1:58:10] good but it ain't no Unity if we're not
[1:58:11] saying the same thing
[1:58:13] better watch it
[1:58:16] a religious act that was trying to get
[1:58:18] the other side of Euphrates you know
[1:58:19] come through Eden
[1:58:21] they were close to Eden they're close to
[1:58:23] the promised land you agree
[1:58:25] but they were bound there 200 000 Devils
[1:58:27] of persecution brother Brandon's telling
[1:58:29] us what they are next quote
[1:58:32] notice what happens under that six
[1:58:34] trumpet the return loose on Jews
[1:58:36] persecute use Supernatural Devils nearly
[1:58:38] two thousand years then loosed by Stalin
[1:58:40] Hitler upon the Jews you say well that
[1:58:42] is a Rome it's the same Spirit exactly
[1:58:47] hmm they've done the same things they
[1:58:49] did to Christians in the old Pagan Roman
[1:58:51] Pagan Roman days now watch the natural
[1:58:53] Israel and the spiritual church now as
[1:58:55] we separated here turn loose on the Jews
[1:58:58] you remember the Sixth Seal how every
[1:59:00] one of those Martyrs are calling
[1:59:01] according to word of God received robes
[1:59:04] under the fifth seal
[1:59:06] that wasn't just the the Jews that were
[1:59:08] killing I mean that goes all the way
[1:59:10] back to the start of the church ages if
[1:59:12] they were blinded in part and they lived
[1:59:14] a true Jewish life they were truly
[1:59:15] Israel God put them under the because
[1:59:18] they were most of them were martyred did
[1:59:19] you know that
[1:59:21] I go show you Jews were martyred way
[1:59:23] back there
[1:59:25] they were put under six seal or fifth
[1:59:27] seal they were given robes the Bible
[1:59:28] says here under that trumpet right
[1:59:32] six trumpet hey what are you talking
[1:59:33] about right I put here my quote six
[1:59:36] trumpet fifth and sixth seal right
[1:59:37] because the fifth seal is a martyr seal
[1:59:39] did those Hunter did those six million
[1:59:41] Jews get martyred
[1:59:43] you agree
[1:59:44] now I'm gonna tell you remember that
[1:59:46] quote logo it said a pre-tribulation
[1:59:47] they also died under tribulation yeah
[1:59:50] Brother Brad is calling that the
[1:59:51] pre-tribulation
[1:59:53] everybody see what I'm saying
[1:59:55] that World War II that was a
[1:59:58] pre-tribulation the fifth and sixth
[2:00:00] trumpets been let out
[2:00:03] persecution everybody got what I'm
[2:00:05] saying loosed on the Jews and that's to
[2:00:08] drive them back to their Homeland right
[2:00:09] does everybody agree with that yeah
[2:00:12] but brother babe say it's a little
[2:00:13] amateur or pre-tribulation now I'm going
[2:00:16] to tell you the fifth and sixth Trump
[2:00:17] would have it quit sounding
[2:00:19] look they killed those Nazi soldiers you
[2:00:22] don't kill those spirits the only time a
[2:00:24] spirit is going to get killed is that
[2:00:25] the Lake of Fire right
[2:00:27] that's before the white Throne judgment
[2:00:29] when the lake of fire comes in because
[2:00:31] those Devils have already been tried
[2:00:33] those Spirits were already in hell
[2:00:36] God don't have to try them over again
[2:00:37] that'd be double jeopardy wouldn't it
[2:00:39] God already seen and found him into hell
[2:00:41] he'd already judged it right do you
[2:00:43] agree yeah so what he's going to do is
[2:00:45] throw them he said he throw the devil
[2:00:47] and his angels in the Lake of Fire the
[2:00:48] white Throne judgment will come and then
[2:00:50] he'll throw those that didn't receive
[2:00:52] eternal light them into the Lake of Fire
[2:00:54] the lake of fire comes before the white
[2:00:56] Throne judgment go read your Bible
[2:00:59] they have Jews who absolutely is against
[2:01:01] Christ and everything the reason they
[2:01:03] are is because the Bible said they are
[2:01:05] blinded and they were blinded for your
[2:01:07] sake right
[2:01:09] Bible and just God knows that they would
[2:01:11] receive it but they were made blind for
[2:01:13] your sake
[2:01:17] there's that piece of trumpet you see
[2:01:19] where he's preaching this
[2:01:21] now where were those let out where were
[2:01:23] they in the sixth trumpet where's he
[2:01:25] preaching it
[2:01:27] Feast of trump everybody agree he's
[2:01:28] preaching at the right place he said but
[2:01:30] I preach those trumpets under the Sixth
[2:01:32] Seal which was the tribulation seal
[2:01:34] those Sia trumpets were open during the
[2:01:37] time of pre-tribulation does everybody
[2:01:38] understand that
[2:01:40] but there's an interval between that
[2:01:42] Trump the sixth trumpet and the seventh
[2:01:45] trumpet he says there's an interval
[2:01:48] he and he shows you the intervals the
[2:01:49] seventh chapter didn't I read it
[2:01:52] what is he does he stops those four
[2:01:53] angels from interrupting nature
[2:01:56] he stops them but he lets that fifth and
[2:01:58] sixth Angel go does everybody understand
[2:02:00] that
[2:02:01] that's what I read
[2:02:03] there's that Roman Empire bound there by
[2:02:05] what the ecclesiastical Powers which
[2:02:08] Rome
[2:02:09] Pagan religious room you see what I mean
[2:02:11] paganism you remember what I said he
[2:02:13] said Heathen is religious rough
[2:02:15] Pagan room becomes people Rome right
[2:02:18] right so you got from Hedonism you go to
[2:02:21] paganism you go to papalism exactly and
[2:02:23] papalism is just nothing but a Unity of
[2:02:25] people under one organization
[2:02:28] that's what was happening when back then
[2:02:30] you agree they were kind to come over
[2:02:32] one world order a long time ago that
[2:02:33] ain't a new statement
[2:02:35] the devil tried to do it under Nimrod
[2:02:37] when he had Babylon oh yeah yeah that
[2:02:39] Spirit was hatched out in Genesis don't
[2:02:41] kid Brother Sam every Spirit was born
[2:02:43] there
[2:02:44] it was bound there in its traditions of
[2:02:46] Christian what part of Christian in the
[2:02:48] superstitions it had of Rome putting
[2:02:51] together all these worship of women yeah
[2:02:56] yeah go to go sell a rigid tool and
[2:02:58] they'll put a woman with a bikini or
[2:02:59] sell the tool all right he'll tell me we

[2:03:28] that was launched
[2:03:30] okay and holidays
[2:03:33] and holy days and things that's been
[2:03:35] bound with that tradition that it cannot
[2:03:37] let loose because it's against Christian
[2:03:40] principles
[2:03:42] that's what he said
[2:03:44] still the same ungodly Pagan spirit and
[2:03:47] that Spirit caught into the nations of
[2:03:49] the world according to the prophets of
[2:03:50] Ezekiel and the rest of them remember

[2:05:21] trumpets and under the seals he hadn't
[2:05:22] seen previously
[2:05:24] I'll use the word Progressive he's
[2:05:26] progressed alone he's seen some Spirit
[2:05:27] come out

[2:05:45] testimony the Beast that had sent it out
[2:05:46] of the bottom of his pit see he did yeah
[2:05:48] I wasn't guessing when I said he'd come
[2:05:50] out the Destroyer abandoned apollyon
[2:05:53] she'll make war against them and shall
[2:05:55] overcome them and kill them
[2:05:57] that's those two prophets remember
[2:05:59] chapter 11. and they're dead bodies
[2:06:01] shall lie in the street in the great
[2:06:02] city which spiritually call Sodom Egypt
[2:06:04] where also our Lord was crucified
[2:06:06] and they they are the people and the
[2:06:08] killers of tongues and they shall see
[2:06:09] their dead bodies three days and a half
[2:06:11] and shall not suffer their dead bodies
[2:06:12] be put in the grave and they shall dwell
[2:06:15] upon the Earth Rejoice over them and
[2:06:17] make marriage shall send gifts one to
[2:06:18] another why not they already got the
[2:06:20] spirit
[2:06:27] am I right

[2:06:31] he said swapping gifts he said let's
[2:06:33] grow up
[2:06:34] come on people it's what I'm gonna
[2:06:38] say something you clean it up okay
[2:06:40] it's Christ Mass it's a Catholic that
[2:06:42] came out of paganism Pagan Rome
[2:06:45] come into papal Rome papal Rome took
[2:06:48] that
[2:06:49] Christmas and tried to make it something
[2:06:51] special when it ain't nothing but a
[2:06:53] pagan it ain't even a Christian
[2:06:54] principle that's what he said people I
[2:06:57] didn't
[2:06:58] swapping gifts look they're going to do
[2:07:01] it there the spirit of that see what it
[2:07:02] brings forth they're going to kill two
[2:07:04] witnesses and they're going to swap
[2:07:05] gifts for it why not I said they already
[2:07:07] got Spirit on them they already got that
[2:07:09] Pagan Spirit on them
[2:07:11] see that's what was loose down the river
[2:07:13] you're afraid I'm gonna be honest with
[2:07:15] you I'm gonna just lay it out that's all
[2:07:16] I know to do
[2:07:17] look when I was a kid they'd start
[2:07:20] putting the Christmas stuff out what
[2:07:22] about December 1st now after Halloween
[2:07:25] October the 30th you start seeing
[2:07:27] Christmas trees in it it's just
[2:07:29] inundated with this paganism stuff all
[2:07:32] over the place
[2:07:34] you didn't see that in your show me
[2:07:36] Christmas in the early church
[2:07:39] I'll challenge anybody we're going to
[2:07:41] fight about the water baptism water
[2:07:44] baptism was changed under that early
[2:07:46] papal Church
[2:07:48] where do you think that stuff come from
[2:07:52] we need to get we need to get away from
[2:07:53] that stuff
[2:07:55] I'm gonna be I don't know I'm gonna
[2:07:57] preach it you we need to grow up
[2:08:00] we get we need to swallower a pride like
[2:08:02] he said step on that thing let's move up
[2:08:11] Pentecostal feasts past the big 50 days
[2:08:14] has passed over Pentecostal Feast has
[2:08:17] passed over seven sabbaths until the
[2:08:18] trumpets a type of the seven Church age
[2:08:20] you know what I said
[2:08:21] you go
[2:08:23] remember under the Sixth trumpet are you
[2:08:26] listening on the sixth trumpet the
[2:08:28] Pentecostals reject the Bible exactly
[2:08:31] exactly you tell me the sixth trumpet
[2:08:33] ain't open he says it is
[2:08:35] when they reject the Bible what he shut
[2:08:38] outside the church
[2:08:40] he said after the Pentecost did he say
[2:08:42] after that when they rejected him in 19
[2:08:45] what is it 63 later in the year brother
[2:08:47] Ram said I indict this generation right
[2:08:50] for the second crucifixion of Jesus
[2:08:51] Christ what was it they took him out of
[2:08:54] Jesus ain't in the church anymore
[2:08:57] here's a quote we say he ain't in the
[2:08:58] churches who are they worshiping it
[2:09:00] ain't worshiping Jesus because remember
[2:09:01] he stands on the outside knocking to get
[2:09:03] in
[2:09:05] that he's in the bride age he I won't
[2:09:07] say he's in the 50s the Jubilee seven
[2:09:10] sevens his church eight we're in a
[2:09:11] jubilee people
[2:09:16] right does everybody agree with what I'm
[2:09:18] saying yeah okay
[2:09:19] the sixth terms of Pentacles reject the
[2:09:21] Bible lukewarm the only Pentecost is all
[2:09:24] the rest right
[2:09:25] the church World rejects Christ and he
[2:09:27] is put on the outside
[2:09:29] and in the same truck but same seal
[2:09:31] rather when it was open just so Jesus on
[2:09:33] the outside church trying to get back in
[2:09:35] same time the trumpet sound for the Jews
[2:09:37] and the Jews recognize the atonement
[2:09:39] right okay the Holy Spirit has been
[2:09:41] bound by these denominational Rivers for
[2:09:43] almost 2000 years but it's loosed in the
[2:09:45] evening time by the evening time message
[2:09:47] right right
[2:09:49] the Holy Spirit back in the church again
[2:09:51] Christ himself revealed in human flesh
[2:09:54] that's the revealing of the son of man
[2:09:56] that's Saint Luke 17 30.
[2:10:01] under the Sixth Seal just before the
[2:10:03] seventh is open right we had and the
[2:10:06] only way you can make this work if you
[2:10:08] understand that free or amateur
[2:10:09] tribulation
[2:10:11] because he said it's between the six
[2:10:12] I'll read the Q I go on and I don't know
[2:10:15] how long I got it's it's 4 30. about
[2:10:18] over Oregon
[2:10:20] okay I'm gonna end it clear quick
[2:10:22] rest of the quotes okay
[2:10:25] I say between the six and seventh seal
[2:10:27] God sends a prophet
[2:10:30] right between the sixth and seventh seal
[2:10:33] God sends two witnesses
[2:10:36] between the sixth and seventh trumpet
[2:10:38] God
[2:10:40] brother in places between the sixth and
[2:10:42] seven Trump and the six and seven seal
[2:10:44] himself and the two witnesses
[2:10:48] is that right you're saying true you
[2:10:49] guys know it let's go let's go up to
[2:10:52] where it says the seventh
[2:10:54] and I'm gonna I'm gonna sum it up and
[2:10:55] we'll get out here
[2:10:58] I talked about Matthew remember
[2:11:04] see between between
[2:11:06] brother and places this interval he
[2:11:08] shows us exactly where it's at
[2:11:11] he froze those first four trumpets until
[2:11:13] those two prophets get on the scene
[2:11:15] those two prophets get on the scene that
[2:11:17] fifth and sixth trumpet is still
[2:11:19] sounding right I can prove to you by the
[2:11:21] scripture that after those two prophets
[2:11:23] are dead the second woe finishes what
[2:11:26] was let out in World War II World War II
[2:11:28] don't end until after those two die
[2:11:30] right those Spirits don't die does
[2:11:33] everybody understand that right those
[2:11:35] two hundred thousand thousand demons are
[2:11:37] still here and they take those six those
[2:11:39] arrested the Jews to the those two
[2:11:41] witnesses to the Grave
[2:11:42] come on that's what he says go look at
[2:11:45] where the woes are right
[2:11:47] uh
[2:11:49] uh is that where it says the seven
[2:11:50] trumpet yeah okay and the seventh angel
[2:11:52] silent there was great voices in heaven
[2:11:54] saying listen to what it says
[2:11:56] the kingdoms not Kingdom it's not just
[2:11:58] talking about the Jews
[2:12:00] cannot say it it's over redemption's
[2:12:03] over right the kingdom of this world
[2:12:05] have become the kingdoms of my God after
[2:12:07] those two and a half Witnesses die after
[2:12:09] the second woe the salmon seal the two
[2:12:13] prophets opened the seventh seal brother
[2:12:15] Ram said it's the coming of the Lord to
[2:12:17] Israel right even he says the seventh
[2:12:21] church had come between the sixth and
[2:12:22] seventh seal that's true Brothers here
[2:12:24] when he came there's two prophets are
[2:12:27] here when that seventh one comes and he
[2:12:29] redeems the 144 000 redemptions over for
[2:12:32] the world
[2:12:33] they'll not I'm gonna be honest after
[2:12:35] that there will not be another one saved
[2:12:38] it's over is that what the salmon seal
[2:12:40] says Brothers
[2:12:42] the kingdoms of this he didn't say
[2:12:43] Kingdom it didn't say the nation of
[2:12:45] Israel said kingdoms
[2:12:47] of this world will become the keys of
[2:12:49] our Lord and he shall reign forever and
[2:12:51] ever amen
[2:12:54] that's the end of the three and a half
[2:12:55] go up let's go I'm sorry
[2:12:58] seven vials come up after that oh yeah
[2:13:02] once those those 144 000 die of
[2:13:05] judgments gonna strike the entire Earth
[2:13:06] brother said those two witnesses call
[2:13:09] those plagues down on the Gentiles huh
[2:13:11] did he say that yeah now I'm gonna be
[2:13:14] honest with you I'm gonna say something
[2:13:15] here when they start calling them four
[2:13:17] down if there's any Jews straggling you
[2:13:18] know there's still six million Jews in
[2:13:19] America
[2:13:22] if he calls those first four do what
[2:13:24] drove Israel back to their Homeland
[2:13:25] plagues what drives them out plagues
[2:13:28] it's exactly typed in the Old Testament
[2:13:30] do you see what I'm saying God ain't
[2:13:32] gonna let none of those 144 thousand die
[2:13:34] until they got to seal
[2:13:36] all right everybody okay with what I'm
[2:13:37] saying right man that's what he's using
[2:13:39] the plagues for to move them right
[2:13:42] her great voice said to him say the same
[2:13:44] and go your ways and pour out the vials
[2:13:45] of Wrath remember they say brother I say
[2:13:47] last plagues
[2:13:49] the Feast of the trumpets is different
[2:13:50] than the last plagues the feast the
[2:13:52] trumpets as plagues going to the Jews to
[2:13:54] drive them back
[2:13:56] okay
[2:13:58] but the interval between that is dealing
[2:14:00] with he he types it as the bride he
[2:14:04] types it as the church
[2:14:06] and 104 in that irritable time they are
[2:14:08] all those three entities here aren't
[2:14:10] they I see why brother Graham could use
[2:14:11] that scripture the way he did
[2:14:13] I don't know of anybody else could put
[2:14:15] it together that perfect do you yeah
[2:14:19] so these vials go to the sixth vial
[2:14:25] sorry guys I really am I don't mean to
[2:14:27] take this long
[2:14:28] we need to start placing it right here I
[2:14:30] saw three unclean spirits like frogs
[2:14:32] come out of the mouth of the dragon out
[2:14:34] of the mouth the Beast now the mouth of
[2:14:35] false prophet go down go down the quotes

[2:14:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost is a spirit
[2:15:02] that gets off on you it's the Holy
[2:15:04] Spirit right okay that really is he says
[2:15:08] now he says he talks about communism he
[2:15:10] said that really isn't it

[2:15:15] Spirits just like that which they were
[2:15:17] kind of a forerunner go up
