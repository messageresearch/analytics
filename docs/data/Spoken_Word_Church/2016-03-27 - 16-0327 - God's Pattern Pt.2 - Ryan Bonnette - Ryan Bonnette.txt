========================================

okay already convicted oh we should kiss happy Easter everybody yeah yeah I'm going he started and probably that's all right I have my father voltar thank you for us to get together tonight in your name we thank you for this Easter table that you raised to throw dust education father's thank you for bearing our sins to Calvary thank you for all the many blessings you've done for a given assorted trader bless the center services today over here to draw the diagram of world there's no dimensional density here is the workers for help us in the Sunday School lessons too or just to you so last time y'all remember me talking about space I was an astronaut brother joe said and I'll tell you I hope I don't lose anybody on that I didn't ever really finish so maybe some of y'all didn't see the relevance of that and see how it pertains to the message of the Bible you might have thought I was often left field and maybe I was because I never really got down to the point so what I want to do I have another lesson to teach you if I finish this one but I don't think I'll get to it pretty sure just going to spend the whole class reviewing that last lesson and trying to hit the nail on the head and kind of make it make sense to you so that's what we're going to do today is review this lesson of God's pattern that is something yeah I'm not using the microphone because it's complicated it's hard to stay on there so uh so why did I talked about the cosmos last time well about the space and all those things first off I want to say y'all don't have to see God in space that's something special to me okay I believe that God is big enough that he's everywhere and that you can see God and whatever is special to you brother Danny he hunts and fishes I think right tries to sometimes well he sees God and nature no doubt because that's his thing say I'll see God I can but I don't look for God that much from nature among major man you know and then brother Aaron you see God in mathematics see what I'm saying this we can all see God leads to like speeches you can see go to the beaches and in the oceans and everything that you look around if you got got in you can see God everywhere my thing is space because i'm partial to the cosmos my god made it and i see a lot of things about God in space that's why I was bringing that out and so I hope I don't lose anybody if I did I don't feel too left out you just look for God in your own life where you see them and what's specially so my god is all around it so let me list some of these things here as I said nature oceans to cause most mathematics for the illustration here all back talked about a certain equation or something math class and he said now how can people home see one God because or something like that wasn't right because of this equation say I mean I wonder sing that is older than much science science is merely I know science is wrong a lot of time because it's man okay science is merely mankind observing the world around him and tell him what he sees and he says he looks at something says well why is that that way and then he taken for my hypothesis and then try to prove it see if they can prove why that thing is that way it is or why it appears if it the way it appears to be that's what science is and sometimes they're wrong they thought the world is flat for a time but you know basically that's a part of mankind got put in man ultimately to seek god man is always seeking for something in searching and trying to get greater in advance and all that well that's part of man that God wanted him to use to seek man right so God wants man to find its way back to God you knew that mankind will fall from from God and he defines way back so we're made to see you know don't know other creatures no other creation is seeking and trying to advance and get better you know the animals just keep building nests and keep you know reproducing and eating and sleeping that's all they ever do they don't really advance but mankind's different man is special in my way you see God in history if you look down through history you see God and you know the wars and the formation of this country you know people came over here with the intent of fun in the country that freedom of religion and you know get off from the Catholic Church and so forth and they wanted to be free and God part of that bless them you can see God in a lot of things about history and then you look at human anatomy I don't know anything about it but if you just look at the human body but there's no doubt in my mind if you study enough about human anatomy you'll see God in that you'll see God in the blood the life is in the blood you see God and the way that our bodies are made and everything about us tells us something about God our bodies were made in His image the fact that we're three a body spirit and soul that tell you something Oh God and everything about us about human and acne is something about thought if you look at and study medical science likewise and then relationships I found that you know years ago I was single and I really had longed for a wife because I wanted someone to love I wanted somebody that I could come for somebody that I could make a living for him and do all the things the husband is supposed to do for a while and God bless me with a wife and gaming the ability to fulfill that but it showed me something about God because he had along at one time he was he brought alone with his attributes and he wanted a bride to manifest himself to do careful will provide for and ultimately to expand himself into say i expanded myself i expanded by having a wife that allowed me to manifest attributes of husband and father and all those things and bring my children so those are just a few of the things i was thinking of the that you we can all see something about gaudium you know that story i couldn't find it the brother battle talked about that little boy that when asked his mom do you see god she said well after sunday school teacher he's sunday school teacher said no glass her pastor pastor said no you can't see God and he eventually asked a sailor or something like that wouldn't and that the Fisher hitting that Fisher said all of ever seen is gone everywhere look because official had some of God in him he could see God everywhere surely out in the water out in the ocean and so forth he could see a law about God so ultimately what I say about all this is that God in the beginning Elohim dwell alone with his attributes and he wanted to be manifested he wanted to expand right so the first thing that he had to manifest was God himself as being God because I'm a human being above all else before I'm a father and reform a son and a brother and the husband before all that I'm a human being I spent primary attribute to me God's primary attribute would be God because before he's anything else he's gone so that's why I agree but a brown that God had to make angles first in order to manifest that part of him is being God then he be called God and creator that's how he does know him as angel as a Dodger career right and I don't understand a whole lot about angles but I know that they're not allowed they're not able to see God in the life that we can see him so God wanting a further creation that he can ultimately move himself over into an image you know a creation maybe his own image and to do that he had to make finite man alright because he had to make a man that could fall in order for him to be able to ever have any chance of no God as a savior and as a healer he had to fall in awe didn't make him fall but he put him in a condition where he was finite and he could fall and I don't fully understand all about that but the point in stopping and making for me not make gone being just so anyway so then God is ultimately trying to move over into this finite man so you have an infinite God and find out man so now here's the thing could God have taken that finite man created him and bring him directly into the presence of Almighty God in heaven I don't think he could have because we have a far night man with an infinite God he wouldn't have understood we would have understood anything if we just ultimately were just born riding around with helping as a say as a as Adam was just a fully grown man and just taken right into the realms of God we wouldn't understood anything about God so he had to have a meeting ground and that was earth God chose the planet Earth to meet man on a finite place to meet a finite math and begin little by little to reveal himself to that man so then i would think that maybe that's why God surrounded man with everything that declares somehow declare something about God because the man here and surround him with the cosmos and relationships all those things I just named in nature in the oceans and the mountains and everything around us declares to us something about God so that mankind would open and begin to look around everywhere the man looks seeking for something else ultimately is going to see something about God so he wants man's understanding and man that way is inclined to come to God see so is everybody saying that okay so that's why i would say that God would make this earth and surrounded with things pertaining to God and then one question in my mind has been widened I go so vastly why did he stretch out so far across the kauffman budding just make an earth in the sun in the moon he could have got bottles just those things just to meet men on but like anything that God does I'm sure there's multiple purposes for it but one thing about it here's what I'm getting into is explain to you some of the things that I see about God is that space all the expense of space is so fast because it takes a great deed creation to declare a great big creator and he knew that someday mankind would begin to advance and begin to look out into space in there indeed still see God and I'm get 2 i'll get your scripture later about i'm sure reiterate but about that scripture that where david said if i send into heaven now aren't there i make my bed in hell they're up there everywhere you go there's God and everywhere you look you see something about God and this is one thought that I've had and maybe it's not running but you know the Lord Jesus in the garden I mean in the in the Gospels we see Jesus have been toward an intimate relationship with his disciples he would speak to others in perils but then with his disciples he expounded them the things and the parables he sit down you tell them all these things and have community them well I would think that the Lord in the garden would make it without irony would sit down maybe one day on the rock and say now I'd minus consider this rock and see them being in the middle of this lush garden not out in the desert not outting in the wilderness or somewhere he put him put them in a garden a place full of life and his need to tell him have him sit down to commune then maybe and say look at this consider this rock and they look at the rock and they so yeah what I see yeah it's a firm heavy rock and then he might say something like well this is me this is a manifestation of make this tell you something about Who I am that I'm the rock with your salvation and I'm the which they one who understood that yet I guess but they say something maybe like on the rock of your revelation okay when my word comes in you and I'll reveal it to you it'll be like this from rock and I can be a foundation and I can build a house upon it's perfectly for you and then you might look at the Alliance they now consider that lion and at that time of course there'd be no fear of the line could be reverence but nobody be afraid of line because it wouldn't be such a that wouldn't be a killing creature and the line might come over and they may be pet the line and then he'd say now this line represents me because I'm fierson everybody valves down reference to me and then you might say consider the eagle and consider the tree he said of the river concealer could consider the mountain and the valley and all these things and he could just go on declaring things to Adam and Eve about himself right there in the garden and that's today I believe what he's still trying to do to his bride is trying to expound him himself to the bride so here's what I see about God in the cosmos first of all first of all I thought last time the hell the reason i believe the Big Bang is because it matches jobs pattern because some of the time now spiritually unnaturally God brings saints from a scene on up to full maturity you look at Jacob fountain big burly man came out of a tiny little frail woman you don't even get him to us on his shoulder para rally hear anything man hang up such a small and for the damn however I'm too many ways right anyway so anyway but see something great you can have something so small and you look at that that is part of the reason I believe that they might not just couldn't other Graham talk about he's talked about the atom bursting you know that came all these cause roles and things but but it is Matthew Scott pattern great things coming from a small see this is what they didn't get you last time and this may not even be right this is what science says they said they're all those flat no wrongs that could be wrong about this but get the point the point I'm making that is still true they said in the beginning and that original particle was nothing but infinite energy infinite density and infinite you know all the matter and everything that we see now was containing that purple and then when God said let there be a burst forth and all out of that came all this energy that spread out over the expanse of space in an instant in a moment and then energy converts to matter ok now when that matter came forth from that energy science says that for every billion in one atoms of matter there were a billion atoms of antimatter I'm really fully understand antimatter but I know the two cancel out so when the matter was first coming forth from that energy it was at it was against all odds in any survival but there was only one greater for every billion atoms of antimatter is only one more Adam matter that survived so we're essentially made all the cosmos was made out of leftovers from that original creation well that tells me something about gone too because God always goes against all odds to prove his own self to prove his that it's him working God works against all one can chase 2002 chased him down to ten thousand to flight so that always goes install lots a little bit of David to defeat a great big of life because of God given that ability so then sure I can see then how that all this matter could be opposed by antimatter and you have that law of opposition you know God has a what I all caught a lot of opposition I don't know what else to call it the basically the nice one declares today and artists you know what declares like is what makes the light know if there was no darkness we wouldn't know like if there was no sin who wouldn't know a savior and if there's no signature with no healing a healer so God has these laws of opposition and it just works all around us and then I out of that original creative act also came all the forces of nature there's four fundamental forces of nature there's gravity electromagnetism and nuclear strong force of nuclear weak force and those things came out of that and science says they all had to be exactly right if there was just a little bit two months of gravity was just a little bit too strong everything will fall into black holes if gravity is too weak nothing would ever for me I'll just keep going into space so it had to be exactly right and that tells you there had to be a mind a divine creator behind that to get everything that's exactly right it didn't just happen science says what we're lucky they got the grab that the big bangs aren't right the big bang in getting right you're starting it had to be perfect and not to mention everybody anybody ever heard of the Goldilocks zone like that's what it's called the earth is just the right distance from the Sun if it was any closer it'd be too hot to sustain life is any further be too cold just insane like we have to be just exactly right as we're floating around the Sun through space and you go throughout the whole galaxies throughout the whole universe you can barely find any planets there in just the right spot to their son that are just close enough to sustain life but he put this one this exactly so and even put the moon in exactly the right spot for the ocean you know to govern the ocean contains to keep the time where it's supposed to be and all the other things so many things I think that planting and I think growing no volley life I think depends somehow on the gravitational pull the Sun so many things rely only mean over the moon so many things rely on the moon being an exactly its location again it shows God had to be there and then about those laws of physics and the laws of those fundamental forces of nature you know Newton we called Newton's laws of motion they're not Newton's laws that he was accredited with discovering them but God created them and personally though the time and this may still be right I don't know ever got it wrong now but there was a time when I thought the job was literally stay on their space this great big man of God and just world in things off his hands just thrown out stars throwing out planets though nothing why would he have to do that wouldn't that make him sort of fun I wouldn't be better to say that he just spoke it and didn't sit back and fold his arms you know and watch it but he was all up all up in it involved in it but yet I believe he spoke it and out of that speaking came laws of gravity knows other ones I named those forces and those forces of what drew the things together because out of that energy came subatomic particles and those formed into atoms because of nuclear strong force of nuclear weak force those formed into molecules and then gravity started pull things together for gases gases are or what stars are made of and then when stars formed and lived and died and cyber stars those chemical processes of fusion and things that make other elements the other elements that didn't come out of the Big Bang and that looks like iron and things that our earth is made out of came out of that so God brought through processes when I'm bang after another another adult mint leaves just his lols i believe the laws because God governs things by laws all throughout the universe its laws of God spiritually and naturally and then these laws are what literally brought things together to bring all the pieces in the right place and God knew each and every atom where would go and where am I know which ones would make the earth and opening them which ones would make our bodies because he knew that we're fearfully made and rock and the lowest parts of the earth of all says he knew exactly where those that were that our bodies would come from that bring us out of the earth that makes sense okay come up anybody sleep all right nothing about the universe is that it's always in motion it's always everything moving nothing is static nothing is stagnated in space everything is either sinning orbiting or moving in some way just like aw he's always moving always advancing forward god never sit still he never stagnates he's always advancing he not changing but he's unfolding is continually unfolding himself becoming greater by our perspective because we're receiving revelation he's not actually changing it all unfolding become greater to us because we're seeing or more other so universe always in motion so it's called the universe they say is expanding I don't understand that but they say the since the Big Bang it started expanding its never stopped everything moving away from everything else I don't know if that's true but I know that God is always expanding he's been ever since he came out of this L him nobody could understand anything about he condescended them to logos and then from there started to create and what is low cost I've been thinking about recently to me it seems like low cost a good way to describe low cost is that it's just a word description of what God hence it's God in letter form its words that God made to describe something about what he is to say that this is what I am he put that in letter form and gave it to us and actually created a thing called language where we can communicate back and forth with one another transmitting a thought from my mind of yours of things that I've thought about then i'm using words language to communicate that to you God does the same thing to us he communicated to us to do the work through the Bible we read it and then God comes to giving inspiration and quick sense to us that's God's life to make us but that's what becomes sent about God I believe and so garden is Fanning that's what he's been doing okay everybody see that pretty good hey psalm 139 to the chief musician of some one day the lord thou has searched me and know me they'll notice my down sitting in mind uprising I understand this my thought afar off now passes my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but local Lord now notice it all together thou has to set me behind him before and lay thy hand upon me such knowledge is to work for me it is hot I cannot attain unto it whether shall I go for my spirit whether shall I flee from that presence if I send up into heaven they weren't there if I make my bed in hell the whole they're out there and I don't believe David actually come please comment actually going to hell I believe you might be pulling up a bit of a sea by me because of committing adultery but even if you turn your back on Lord fog away from the Lord yet there still remain in your thoughts and you'll feel a conviction come on it and you'll come back to the Lord but he's everywhere we go we can't get away from the presence of the lord if I take the lens of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall i hand leave me and I right hand shall holding I looked up teasing the Greek much can the best I can tell about the wings of the morning would be like of course the morning is the dawn and in the dawn in the morning if you're looking out East wing's means edge of something so you'll see where the light is scattering the darkness that makes kind of a line there and if you were to take that I think David say and ride that over to say go if you're looking at your if the west coast and looking out over the ocean or something right over a body of water you derive that out there and that most parts of the sea then God would still be with you anywhere you go in the world are in the cosmos anywhere you look you see God if I say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be like about me the darkest hot if not from thee but the nite chef is the day the darkness the darkness and the light are both alike to thee for thou hast possessed my range that has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee Brian fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth as I said what would go into every atom they kind of that big bang every item in the beginning of creation wherever wound up it and where it would be to make up our natural bodies you know makeup us that thine eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect and then the book all my members were written which in containments were fashioned when it's just it was none of them how precious are also are the thoughts and me oh god how great is the son of them if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I wake I'm still with thee surely that will slay the wicked old dog depart for me therefore you've let him in where they speaking directly and our enemies will take my name in vain all right that's all that didn't want to read ok John 11 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning winter coming all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made he made all things he made it for his glory God doesn't waste any effort i don't believe God does anything in vain everything he does has a purpose you know and no word will return to Him voice phone says his word will accomplish what sent to accomplish so if we made everything in His image made anything for a purpose then it would be all you know like I said a while ago somehow to declare something about him the creation declares the Creator and it's to bring us back to him Ronan's 124 the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead so that there were that excuse because when they knew not when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither we're thankful of invading their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened but the invisible thing through that again of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made the things that are made declare even his power is eternal power and Godhead say so everywhere we look even carnal you know senators look around everywhere they look they see God but I mean I realize they're looking at all but they're looking at a creation of God that declares Scott Rawlins 1136 love him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen and Hebrews let him free through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which to appear God literally brought something from nothing because he's creator all right let's see all right and you'll remember me talking about this image last time this is a computer-generated image of what the Big Bang might have looked like basically very bright very brilliant very fast and very hot very violent woman and tongue when the matter-energy was releasing payment space right he is wise in heart and mighty in strength a dope 94 who has hardened himself against him and hath prospered which remove it the mountains and they know not which overturn them and his anger was shaking the earth I've replaced and the pillars there of criminals which commanded the Sun and advise if not and silloth of the stars which along spread it out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea which make it Arcturus Orion and Pleiades which are constellations and the chambers of the south of the finger also some grouping of constellations which do is great things past finding out yeah and motors without number all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out this is one last comment about this lesson mankind cannot find the end of the universe this is just one picture taken from the hubble space telescope in space just as far as you can see there are stars galaxies things that God is made mankind cannot find the end of the universe what does it tell you about God all this time through all time then kind has been searching try to find out God find out something about him and see if they could find the end of the matter you know and is every time something's reveal to you more comes out of it every time you see something like you think well that's all there is to see about that scripture well then here comes more than unfolds God is just endless and there's no interim just like the creation you make I don't know if there isn't in the universe I kind of doubt about it some are another I guess the finite creation would I don't know I mean honestly but mankind can find it that's the point we cannot search and find the end of God most of the universe is still not understood and it's therefore a mystery just like God as much as we've studied about God we still can't find a min to God we still can't understand all the rest understand about God I leave something for eternity shal cuz we're getting enough heaven here we go to heaven on we're getting off of God to go be with God and and that will see the Eternity them that through the universe ages of attorney will be receiving a message of cheer and God continues to unfold himself through eternity because he's a great big guard full of mystery anybody any questions about that one I just wanted to say something about that last picture you had that amazing and he doesn't do anything for you he's right so somewhere we learned that they all have those strong any other question I can start on this next lesson wake up a few more minutes if that's all right I won't finish it I know that but I standardization to go hard okay this is a lesson about believing like they don't get very far but least I get to the the main point right up front maybe you'll see what I've been thinking about here lately you know we kind of overlooked believing we're kind of over overestimate it or underestimated I mean I think it's just some minor something but it really is a great big thing in the Christian walk and recently I got to thinking about it was something that I've never seen before ism you know I'll get them to the scripture in a little while but jesus said I go away the comforter may come and when the comforter is come he will need you and guide your own truth I always stop that man when I came into the message and and came onto the truth too much more likely what I've seen in Baptist Church I said well this is wonderful and I thought I thought well I can't go wrong now you know I can't believe wrong now I'm in the message i'm under this head shipping brother Dale on shelter and I can't believe false doctrine but that's not so I believe the false finebros so close to the truth on that it will deceive the elective console and I believe that possibly we could walk into false talking for time and begin to see it but God is obligated he'll bring us back he'll go back after his lost sheep but he'll lead us to the truth what he said he did not say he'll make you believe the truth he said my spirit I'll lead you and guide you in all truth and it still makes you believe it you can present it to you all through time has been presented to mankind life and death ever since the garner Dean was life and death blessing and cursing good and evil right and wrong has only been set before us and we choose so that's where the believing comes in you get to choose what to believe and you have to find you have to search out the spirituals with every doctrine every spirit that comes to you and find it in the Bible and see how it pairs up and if you find one thing falls it doesn't have to be ten scripture to disprove it just won't work against it means it's false you remember how careful our pastor is that he talks all he talks all the time about that one time when he found something that that something told him about this idea or dolphin or something that he came up with you that something said that if you do that you make your type crediting ant attack so he was serious about he crumbled up burned it threw it away I mean everything told sister Peggy about whatever it was because he didn't wanted to see me they don't believe in somebody he didn't want to spread a false doctrine that's how serious it was about it and that makes me to realize that we often do very careful about what we choose to believe because the are believing is in the womb of our mind and when you are receiving a false doctrine in the womb of your mind you're identifying with it you're making yourself one with that post offering and it's actually I believe it's the spirit of adultery but you know I believe God can wink at your ignorance if you do it no not knowing any better if you do it thinking that it's in the Bible because every false doctrine has some basis in the Bible you can find some scripture and quote to prove almost I mean every false doctrine I guess so it looks good for a while but when you keep going and consider the end of the matter you find out that there's something false with it and are you going to hold on for the false doctor because it's a feel-good doctrine or because there's a lust demon associated with it or are you going to cast it now because truthfully the false doctrines seem so much more appealing than the true you know there's no beauty that we should desire you as I have said and you know the truth is pretty straight and hard and you know John 8 that book and it became bitter in him because he had to go and live it afterward the truth is bitter something done because it separates us from family separates us from loved ones it's really hard and sometimes it's this not to be desired you know I mean we want we would rather just go a bit easier just to play the false talking sometimes and just settle for them but we have to stick to the straight and narrow way and believe the truth against all against all adversity so and the Bible talks many many times about believeth on going you don't just believe one comma then you're set for your whole Christian journey every day you when you have a false doctrine or some false idea that comes in your mind or some ministry presents something on the tape or whatever you have to try that spirit see with me of God because if it's false and you buy into that you you're identifying with it and I believe it will can't go ring you will cause a lot of problems until you get rid of okay so that's an ongoing it's believable you have to continue to leave the truth and continue to cast down the false and I use this analogy and that probably about all I have timelines so a woman when a man approaches a woman with the intent of consummation then the woman has to do one thing chance to discern is that my husband because legally she can only take her husband so is that my husband well with the problem is sadness that he comes in unaware she comes in appearing as an angel of light the minister of life revelation he comes before us it looks like our husband Christ and so we might be tempted or we are tempted very much so to take that because it looks real it looks right and you're trying to do the right thing you want to believe the truth so then the woman has to be very careful because she don't take her husband but if she take some other word see what she's doing is accepting another man see that's not her husband so then if we accept false stopping in the womb of our mind and I said it won't bring light that will bring death of certainly plus 1 is can see brings sin sin when it's finished or unbelief when it brings death okay the end state of these false talkers is always dead spiritually so it will separate us from God so then so then when we accept it anything except with it right or wrong what we're doing is actually believing whether it be true or false so the state i guess that's going to be all yeah let's go MIA from day I'll try again in this lesson next time and thank you all your questions
