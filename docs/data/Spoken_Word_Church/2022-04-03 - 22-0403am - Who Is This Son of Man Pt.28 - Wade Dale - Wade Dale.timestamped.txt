[2:57] one of
[2:58] the days of the son of man and you shall

[3:13] far as the lightning the lightness
[3:16] out of the parts under heaven
[3:20] shining
[3:21] unto the other part under heaven
[3:24] so shall
[3:25] the son a man be
[3:28] in his day
[3:37] as it was in the days of noah so shall
[3:41] it be in the days of the son of man
[3:45] [Music]

[4:00] it was in the days a lot they did eat
[4:03] they drank
[4:04] they bought
[4:06] they sold they planted they built
[4:19] even thus
[4:21] shall it be in the days when the son of
[4:24] man is revealed
[4:42] remember that's why
[4:54] i tell you
[4:55] in that night
[4:56] there shall be two men in one bed
[5:00] that shall be taken one shall be taken
[5:03] and the other
[5:04] shall be left
[5:13] two men shall be in the field and the
[5:16] one shall be taken and the other left
[5:20] and they are asked
[5:23] well lord he shall unto them
[5:27] whose shall everybody is
[5:30] thou will the eagles be gathered
[5:32] together

[19:57] try to do from now on is
[19:59] um hook up to the zoom meeting part of
[20:01] it so
[20:02] if you can't come you can watch it
[20:04] online and it was good one this is
[20:05] afraid to be able to watch and and the
[20:07] brothers and sisters from ohio we were
[20:09] just sitting up there last weekend and
[20:11] they said well we can we hear your
[20:14] bible study because we we recorded on a
[20:16] little bitty recorder and then brother
[20:17] joe puts it online maybe you know
[20:19] several days or even a week later
[20:21] sometimes
[20:22] and they said we we would like to be
[20:24] able to where we could ask questions
[20:25] also
[20:26] so
[20:27] um
[20:29] when i got back we got with brother
[20:30] anderson the bulldog
[20:32] he's now an official bulldog
[20:35] so brother anderson and brother luis
[20:37] brother
[20:38] richard robertson brother
[20:41] joe and all the different ones they all
[20:42] kind of put their heads together and and
[20:44] came up with this zoom meeting and we
[20:45] had a camera downstairs and and the ones
[20:48] from ohio were able to see us and we
[20:50] were able to see them
[20:51] so uh they're just part of us we're just
[20:54] an extension of
[20:55] you know we got extended family
[20:57] man
[20:58] but uh thank god for our brothers that
[21:00] put all that together for us so man
[21:07] also wednesday night brother aaron will
[21:08] be ministering for us
[21:10] um
[21:12] remember too that uh april the 15th 16th
[21:15] and 17th
[21:17] will be our um
[21:19] i guess first annual easter meeting
[21:21] brother joel fournier will be here at
[21:23] seven o'clock um
[21:25] from the home of angora at three
[21:27] and then brother mike ultieg at
[21:31] regular service on sunday
[21:34] now we got to get together with the food
[21:36] uh mom's compiling the list in june both
[21:39] of them are
[21:40] looking at that just releasing different
[21:42] ones just get with them
[21:43] we'll announce it next sunday from here
[21:46] uh what to bring we're expecting a
[21:48] pretty good crowd there'll be
[21:50] 10 or 11 or 12 from ohio
[21:52] there'll be um several from brother
[21:55] homer's church that's staying over
[21:57] and brother joe's put it online
[21:59] so there's already a brother called this
[22:01] morning and the reason i'm saying this
[22:03] is if you have a place where somebody
[22:05] can stay
[22:07] i know that uh
[22:08] brother joe canada's house will be full
[22:11] my house will be full
[22:13] brother louise's house will be
[22:16] pretty much full if they all come
[22:18] um one of the one of the one of the kids
[22:20] is having acl surgery so we don't know
[22:23] if he's going to be able to make it or
[22:24] not but we're going to pray that he is
[22:28] and then you've got
[22:29] brother boyd's got a couple staying with
[22:31] him
[22:32] and then there's a brother from brother
[22:33] tom creshan's church
[22:35] um
[22:36] he's called this morning and he would
[22:38] like a place to pay if we can so let's
[22:40] just all get together if you want to
[22:42] write it down or tell somebody you tell
[22:43] me or sister june
[22:46] uh if you have a place for someone to
[22:48] stay we would appreciate it
[22:50] and uh
[22:52] we'll uh we'll give you some money for
[22:53] the food and all those things because
[22:55] it's saving uh it's saving them a
[22:58] 100 a night motel bill
[23:01] and it it's it just saves them from
[23:03] eating i i kind of like brother
[23:05] brother emanuel salazar
[23:07] when he had his meetings
[23:09] in june he told me he said brother wait
[23:11] he said i don't want people to fly or
[23:13] drive all the way out here and then have
[23:14] to pay for a room and then have to pay
[23:16] for a meal so they cooked every meal for
[23:18] people out there
[23:19] and all the preachers that came in they
[23:21] took care of their room
[23:23] so
[23:23] so
[23:24] i just don't want it to be a burden i
[23:25] want you to be happy in the lord but i
[23:27] don't it money it takes money
[23:29] sorry it takes money to get here takes
[23:31] money to go home it takes money to stay
[23:32] so we want to uh
[23:34] take the burden off that's why on
[23:36] saturday after the service we're going
[23:38] to have a full we'll have a full meal
[23:41] on that day so just keep that on prayer
[23:43] brother dale's birthday will be that day
[23:44] on the 16th
[23:45] and just remember also
[23:48] um

[24:56] just keep your minds clear and let's
[24:58] turn to john 1 verse 1 and let's begin
[25:02] remember brother aaron will be speaking
[25:04] for us wednesday
[25:06] we've got several things in august
[25:08] that's coming up brother joe's working
[25:09] on a calendar for april so he can put it
[25:11] up on the screen
[25:13] so that we can
[25:15] not forget what i just said
[25:19] what did i just say
[25:22] forget what i just said john 1 verse 1
[25:25] but just pray for each and every one
[25:28] i'm like brother bob in different ones
[25:30] you you feel an urgency somewhere you
[25:32] just don't know
[25:33] enough i don't have enough sorry
[25:34] discernment
[25:36] but that you feel the urge or the pull
[25:37] that something something needs to happen
[25:41] and it's not that we're going to try to
[25:42] make it happen
[25:43] but we're just going to walk in the word
[25:45] of god and let god do it
[25:47] that way it won't be just an emotion or
[25:49] a feeling it'll be a heartfelt something
[25:51] coming from the heart and if it comes
[25:53] from the heart if you got the new birth
[25:55] it's god amen so if you've got any birth
[25:57] in your heart that's god and he's one to
[25:59] what he's wanting to
[26:01] open you up so you can see him
[26:04] in your life
[26:06] that's why we're
[26:07] talking on who is this son of man we're
[26:09] looking at his life
[26:11] the life of jesus christ the man all
[26:13] right this afternoon we'll bring a
[26:14] little bit different
[26:15] um
[26:16] avenue this afternoon but this morning
[26:18] let's continue on and let's uh
[26:20] background a little bit in john 1 verse
[26:21] 1 let's pray
[26:23] the heavenly father we thank you for
[26:24] this day lord we pray that you would be
[26:26] with us lord during this service
[26:28] you be the active participant lord you
[26:30] do the revealing you do the speaking
[26:32] and lord lord just be with each one
[26:34] father just give us a renewed
[26:37] as we renew our vows many times lord
[26:39] we're already married but we'd like to
[26:41] renew our vow our vows to
[26:43] to just
[26:44] just reaffirm
[26:46] that we're married to you lord reaffirm
[26:48] that you're there with us father
[26:50] we pray lord that you'd be with each one
[26:52] that's sick we have sick here in this
[26:54] service we have sick that's out in the
[26:57] internet and at different places we have
[26:58] sick that are at home lord we pray that
[27:00] you're just healing father you're still
[27:02] in the healing business
[27:04] but lord we want the healing of the soul
[27:06] first we want to make sure everybody's
[27:08] got their soul healed
[27:10] before
[27:11] we take on the other part lord it will
[27:13] just completely trust in you lord you're
[27:15] still like the healer that the prophet
[27:18] of god gave us
[27:19] the um
[27:20] he showed us the example of what to do
[27:23] lord that you would come and and you
[27:25] would heal the people from all diseases
[27:28] not just a few but all diseases and the
[27:30] bible tells us that
[27:32] if we believe
[27:34] believe in our heart and confess with
[27:36] our mouth so lord lord we're believing
[27:38] that and confessing today that you'll
[27:40] heal the people father
[27:42] keep us lord safe in your arms lord
[27:45] we need you more than anything now the
[27:47] the wilds of the world is trying to
[27:49] creep in on every hand they're trying to
[27:51] separate us and move us about and and
[27:53] lord your little bride will be beat up
[27:54] but she won't be defeated
[27:56] amen so i pray lord that you just be
[27:58] with each one today lord give us the
[28:00] words to say to the people and may they
[28:02] hear lord from you in jesus name we pray
[28:05] amen
[28:06] in the beginning was the word the word
[28:07] was with god and the word was god verse
[28:09] 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[28:11] among us we beheld his glory as it only
[28:14] begotten of the father full of grace and
[28:17] truth so let's read romans 8 verse 18
[28:20] for i reckon that the suffering of this
[28:21] present time are not worthy to be
[28:22] compared with the glory which shall be
[28:24] what revealed
[28:26] in us that's speaking toward the son of
[28:28] man all right listen for i reckon that
[28:30] the sufferings
[28:31] not the parties
[28:33] not the flowery betta bees
[28:35] not the smooth road
[28:38] not the wide road
[28:40] amen so that leads you to destruction
[28:42] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[28:44] present time are not worthy to be
[28:45] compared with the glory which shall be
[28:47] revealed
[28:48] in us for the earnest
[28:50] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[28:52] the manifestation of the sons of god you
[28:54] may be seated in the lord as blessing we
[28:56] were talking last night about
[28:59] where brother branham was talking in in
[29:01] uh i believe it's 1964
[29:03] and paraphrasing he said he said i uh he
[29:06] said what you see in part
[29:08] is going to be brought in its fullness
[29:10] when the church comes to power amen now
[29:12] listen we've got power now
[29:15] but there's a power coming and i'll read
[29:17] you the quote a little bit later on
[29:18] there's a power coming and we'll look at
[29:20] it this afternoon
[29:21] with the chart that we'll look at later
[29:24] at the end of the service that brother
[29:25] bob's been using on the statue of
[29:27] perfect man and the three stages as you
[29:29] grow up
[29:30] you know as we sit here today we have
[29:32] the holy ghost in our soul if you're
[29:34] born again you have the holy ghost in
[29:36] your soul
[29:37] all right well listen jesus was on the
[29:38] river jordan he was the holy ghost
[29:41] he didn't need the holy ghost he was the
[29:43] holy ghost that soul that was inside of
[29:45] him was the soul of god and the spirit
[29:46] was the spirit of god it wasn't a
[29:48] separate person amen
[29:51] but you and i get it by measure but he
[29:54] had an anointing that came on him in the
[29:56] river at the river jordan why did he
[29:57] need that anointing it was for his
[29:59] ministry it was for something you you
[30:01] look at brother browner and he'll he'll
[30:02] preach a sermon and it'll be revelation
[30:04] like you wouldn't believe and then all
[30:06] of a sudden he said well we're going to
[30:07] have a prayer line
[30:09] well you would think man that anointing
[30:10] would just no he said
[30:12] it's a different anointing
[30:14] what'd he say i'm waiting on him well
[30:16] well him was there all the time
[30:19] him was doing the preaching
[30:20] but him was getting ready to step over
[30:22] into another
[30:24] part or phase of his ministry well
[30:26] that's the same way with you and i'm
[30:27] going up to snatch a perfect man you
[30:29] don't get the new birth two or three
[30:31] times you get the new birth one time but
[30:33] you get a feeling of the holy ghost an
[30:35] anointing
[30:36] a revelation
[30:39] as you could progress up the statue of a
[30:40] perfect man or as we walk through life
[30:43] uh we were talking you know
[30:46] just yesterday at this
[30:48] bible study and i i
[30:50] stumble at my words but i'm trying to
[30:52] think of
[30:53] i don't want to be so brash about it but
[30:56] i mean
[30:57] how are you going to make it without
[30:58] somebody teaching you the statue of
[31:00] perfect man
[31:02] everybody wants the great seals they
[31:04] want the third pool to work in their
[31:05] life god is not going to use a baby
[31:11] to bring the dead out of the ground
[31:15] it's going to be a mature listen jesus
[31:17] was almighty god as a baby right
[31:21] but there was nothing sad for 29 years
[31:23] of that man's life except right there at
[31:25] 13 when he popped up and was in the
[31:27] temple right
[31:28] they call it the silent years there was
[31:30] a silent time in there what he was
[31:32] growing in grace and knowledge that
[31:34] humanity part of him was being human
[31:37] but he did come to a place there at the
[31:39] river jordan where god said all right
[31:42] this is my beloved son in whom i'm
[31:43] pleased to dwell and then he still had
[31:45] to walk for three more years in that
[31:48] anointing before the other before the
[31:50] other anointing came down
[31:53] before the other anointing came down
[31:57] at the mountaintop
[31:58] and said this is my beloved son hear ye
[32:01] him
[32:02] all right
[32:03] we should have heard him back before but
[32:05] really when you come up to this point
[32:07] it's like brother brown i'm preaching to
[32:08] 47 to 63 and all of a sudden god said if
[32:10] you're going to get anything you can get
[32:11] it from him because this is now his
[32:13] message
[32:15] this is now his message and remember
[32:17] john 17 and the great part of the
[32:19] scripture that john and and the
[32:21] different ones
[32:24] portray as
[32:25] you know his movement through his
[32:27] journey is that the river jordan
[32:30] sure he preached the kingdom of heaven
[32:31] is at hand he had great healing signs
[32:33] and wonders and many things went on
[32:35] right
[32:36] but re look at it after matthew 17
[32:40] after the mountain transfiguration
[32:43] um part of his ministry started
[32:46] brother brown said six months later he
[32:48] was dead
[32:49] but
[32:50] he preached the seals
[32:52] in matthew 24.
[32:54] all right john 17 he prayed that we be
[32:57] one then now why didn't he do that you
[32:59] know what i'm saying even in his even in
[33:01] his ministry he progressed
[33:03] amen
[33:04] so even in brother brown's ministry he
[33:06] progressed so any any any minister uh if
[33:10] you're not seeing a progression in their
[33:11] message then you you know there's
[33:13] they're either stumbling or they're
[33:14] going around the mountain the same you
[33:16] know like they were before
[33:18] that's the same way with all of us we
[33:19] need to be where now we we understand
[33:22] not by rev not by knowledge not by head
[33:24] knowledge but by that knowledge
[33:27] understand more about the word of god
[33:30] and many places that we were talking
[33:32] about last night
[33:33] there's many places that you can go and
[33:35] preach to and you have to background so
[33:37] much till you never get to your sermon
[33:39] because they're not well taught but
[33:41] there's not a preacher ever stepped in
[33:42] this pulpit that said i'm gonna have to
[33:44] talk for two or three hours to get you
[33:46] all to know what i'm talking about
[33:48] no they always step in and they say
[33:49] you've been well
[33:51] hey man you've been well taught all
[33:53] right
[33:54] because they know
[33:56] they know that the background
[33:58] all right they say what they want to
[33:59] about this church and about the ministry
[34:01] i really don't care
[34:03] but i think we're on the right track
[34:05] if we're not we'd better like brother
[34:06] dale said if this is not it we need to
[34:08] find something
[34:09] we need to find what is it
[34:11] but romans 8 18 gives us an earnest
[34:13] expectation we're going to talk about
[34:14] that a little bit later on
[34:16] but we know that we are predestinated to
[34:18] adoption so see that's our anointing
[34:22] math you know you take you take martin
[34:24] luther you take john wesley
[34:26] even the pentecostals
[34:28] they were not predestinated to adoption
[34:32] because they didn't have all of the word
[34:34] they didn't have an open book
[34:36] they didn't have
[34:38] something to go to they they had they
[34:40] had reformers i'm trying to pick my
[34:41] words because they were prophets
[34:43] okay
[34:45] even though even though
[34:47] they father son holy ghost and they had
[34:49] all these little things that was off
[34:51] god winked at that because he knew that
[34:53] the fullness would come which was here
[34:55] with us the fullness would be here so
[34:58] god is patiently waiting on us to get to
[35:01] that spot and i believe we're at that
[35:02] spot now amen and like i said before you
[35:05] can stay home and listen to tapes all
[35:07] you want to but you will never come to
[35:09] full maturity without a pastor and
[35:11] without the fivefold ministry and coming
[35:13] to church
[35:14] it ain't going to happen they ain't
[35:16] going to happen
[35:18] because the bible said it's not going to
[35:20] happen
[35:21] okay so you can you can you can uh
[35:25] i hate to say this you're denying the
[35:27] word
[35:28] you're denying the word
[35:30] when you say i can get it on my own
[35:32] or or as um
[35:35] some were talking as we were talking
[35:37] this morning about the zoom meeting
[35:38] every time we do something like that you
[35:40] know you
[35:41] you picture people that are sitting
[35:43] around drinking coffee with their bunny
[35:45] jammies on and their bunny shoes on
[35:47] watching the
[35:49] paul did you have yours on yesterday
[35:52] freda said he did
[35:55] i realize people can't all get
[35:57] to church okay
[35:59] but if if you make it an excuse to stay
[36:01] home
[36:02] um yeah i have a problem with that so
[36:04] does god because he told us in the bible
[36:06] he didn't say zoom your meetings
[36:09] he said come to church assemble yourself
[36:11] together but if you can't um that's what
[36:13] we were talking about you know if we
[36:14] start doing zoom meetings on the bible
[36:16] study the room will be empty i don't
[36:18] think so i think it was full last night
[36:21] so and there were several many that
[36:23] weren't there so
[36:25] i think we're okay
[36:26] but just don't let use that as a crutch
[36:29] don't use it as a crutch
[36:31] and i know as we get older like sister
[36:32] johnny and certain ones man it's a it's
[36:34] a blessing
[36:36] a blessing to be able to
[36:38] to enter in she was so happy i think she
[36:40] called mama she called the pope she
[36:41] called the president
[36:43] she called the congress and she called
[36:45] june this morning about 7 30. praising
[36:47] the lord that she could enter into the
[36:48] service just enough to be able to see
[36:51] the service and and you know enter into
[36:53] the service of us being there amen
[36:56] so that's okay and that's all right but
[36:58] just don't make it a crutch
[37:00] all right don't make it a crutch the
[37:01] word says well i really don't my cat's
[37:03] sick so i'm not going to church
[37:05] i've heard that before but we're
[37:08] predestinated to adoption brother louis
[37:10] said yeah we are predestinated to
[37:12] adoption so we're not predestinated to
[37:14] just come and sit in church and listen
[37:16] to a good sermon and say thank you lord
[37:18] and go home
[37:20] we're predestinated to adoption which is
[37:22] going to do what now it's going to carry
[37:24] us
[37:25] it's going to carry us into the statue
[37:27] of a perfect man which then god's going
[37:30] to do something with that person
[37:32] we'll talk about that in a little while
[37:34] positionally placed i'll read a quote
[37:36] where brother brown says only this
[37:37] message you can be positionally placed
[37:40] amen only in this message you can be
[37:42] positionally placed hey man thank god
[37:44] for a prophet
[37:45] thank god for the message of the hour
[37:46] that he gave you a message
[37:48] and that you responded to that message
[37:50] all right
[37:51] so let's go to ephesians one verse one
[37:54] we're just backgrounding this morning
[37:56] to bring what we need this
[37:58] this afternoon is everybody all right
[38:00] amen i'm gonna quit doing this because
[38:02] they all started doing it ohio they're
[38:03] all doing this and
[38:05] do you hear me now
[38:08] i just want to know if you hear me
[38:11] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[38:13] will of god to the saints
[38:15] which are at ephesus and to the faithful
[38:17] in christ jesus now that's who he's
[38:19] talking to us
[38:20] all right grace be to you in peace from
[38:22] god our father and from the lord jesus
[38:24] christ and we look at verse three we
[38:26] look at that being show that was in the
[38:28] mind of god said blessed be the god and
[38:30] father my lord jesus christ who has
[38:32] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[38:34] in heavenly places according as he has
[38:37] chosen us in him chosen us not by him
[38:40] there's a lot of people chosen by god
[38:42] to do a certain thing everything is
[38:44] ordained of god listen folks god
[38:46] orchestrates this whole thing
[38:48] you say no no the devil
[38:49] god orchestrates this whole thing
[38:53] satan is a puppet
[38:56] in the hand of god because he's never
[38:58] god's never going to be defeated amen
[39:01] according as he has chosen us in him
[39:03] when
[39:05] before the foundation of the world
[39:07] that we should be holy and without blame
[39:09] before him in love where were we before
[39:11] the beginning of time where were we
[39:14] brother branham where were we he said we
[39:16] were nothing
[39:17] only in the mind of god
[39:20] only in the mind of god we were
[39:22] something we were we were the genesis 1
[39:24] 26 we were the part of god that he was
[39:26] getting ready to unfold or unveil in
[39:29] this great plan of redemption
[39:31] all right that we should be holy and
[39:32] without blame before him in love see
[39:34] what god's already seen he's already
[39:35] seen us holy it's what we're going to
[39:38] talk about this this afternoon you we've
[39:40] got to come to a place that that we've
[39:42] been truly justified
[39:45] you say oh brother i got justified uh is
[39:47] brother bibletown we got justified
[39:49] before the new birth you got justified
[39:50] for the sins you used to do
[39:53] but brother brown said the unclean
[39:54] spirit's still there and you're going to
[39:55] continue sinning
[39:57] on down the road now listen if we
[39:59] continue sinning on down the road we
[40:00] ain't got the new birth
[40:03] once we come to the new birth to the
[40:04] justification we're going to talk about
[40:05] this afternoon which is the real you
[40:07] didn't do it then we got to come to a
[40:09] place that listen to take a body change
[40:11] you got to realize that that person
[40:13] inside of you is blameless
[40:16] now it is now already
[40:18] but we're not realizing it we're letting
[40:20] the past get a hold of us we're letting
[40:21] this and and this person didn't shake my
[40:23] hand and this person don't preach long
[40:25] enough and this one preaches too long
[40:34] that we should be holy and without blame
[40:36] before him in love
[40:37] having what predestinated by for
[40:40] knowledge
[40:44] by for knowledge by your free will
[40:48] so i don't have a choice you got a
[40:50] choice every day of your life you've got
[40:52] a choice today
[40:54] choose you this day
[40:55] who you'll serve
[40:57] amen having predestinated us what this
[41:00] is the mind of god seeing down through
[41:02] time seeing everything that's going to
[41:04] happen seeing every avenue that you
[41:06] would take even though you didn't make
[41:08] that choice
[41:11] oh my
[41:13] yeah you get quiet brother dale's
[41:14] preached it too about several years ago
[41:16] and y'all all got quiet too i remember
[41:17] that
[41:18] because if he's infinite he knows every
[41:20] avenue you would take if you had decided
[41:22] this or decided this or decided this he
[41:25] knew what avenue you would take that's
[41:26] why i've always told you that god's nose
[41:28] are the best yes you'll ever get because
[41:30] you're wanting to go down this path and
[41:32] you're just hell-bent to go down this
[41:33] path
[41:35] and god goes um
[41:37] i'm shutting the door
[41:38] well that's the best yes you'll ever get
[41:40] because god knows what's behind that
[41:41] door and what you do when that door
[41:43] opens amen so that's the best thing to
[41:45] do is listen to the word of god listen
[41:47] to your pastor listen to the ones that
[41:49] have wisdom that when you tell them
[41:51] you're going to do something and i like
[41:52] what brother dale's always said he said
[41:54] he said when you come and tell me you're
[41:55] going to do something he said what do
[41:56] you want me to do
[41:58] what do you want me to do you already
[42:00] decided what you're going to do you're
[42:01] telling me what you're going to do but
[42:02] if you approach it to look i've got
[42:04] these two options brother i've got this
[42:06] option in this option which option looks
[42:08] good all right instead of coming the
[42:10] brother down saying i'm i'm going to do
[42:12] this what do you think about it
[42:14] that's kind of
[42:16] the cart before the horse
[42:18] amen
[42:19] but think about that in all that you do
[42:22] i mean we make up our mind a lot of
[42:24] times to do stuff
[42:25] we've never done it before we make up
[42:28] our mind to do something
[42:29] and it doesn't matter if we if the door
[42:31] closes we're a little bit headstrong and
[42:33] we just butt right on through the door
[42:36] watch what a goat does
[42:39] but but but but
[42:42] having predestinated us into the
[42:43] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[42:45] himself according to the good pleasure
[42:47] of his will and his will is his word
[42:49] find yourself in the word of god
[42:51] let's look at number one real quick
[42:54] now preaching usually catches the sinner
[42:56] brings him under condemnation by the
[42:57] word but teaching places a man
[42:59] positionally what he is now it doesn't
[43:01] just place you it places you
[43:02] positionally all right
[43:05] it places you positionally what he is
[43:06] and we can never rightly be able to have
[43:08] faith i keep reading this quote and i'm
[43:11] going to keep reading it because we can
[43:12] never i'm talking about us all of us we
[43:14] can never rightly be able to have faith
[43:18] until
[43:20] positionally we know what we are
[43:23] now he's not talking about this faith
[43:25] right here
[43:27] because according to that you're already
[43:29] born again
[43:31] you've got to have position your
[43:32] position goes here
[43:34] this is where you find your position but
[43:36] that faith right there is a faith that
[43:38] nobody's ever had before
[43:41] is to take a body change
[43:43] without death that's what we were
[43:44] talking about last night
[43:46] let's go to number two real quick
[43:48] adoption
[43:49] 1960.
[43:50] now what is adoption now let me get this
[43:52] now continue down your adoption is not
[43:54] your birth so we've already separated
[43:56] the two that you can be born again today
[43:58] and not be adopted
[44:01] but there is a spirit of adoption there
[44:03] is a open door of adoption that you can
[44:05] step in if you want to if you don't want
[44:08] to god's not going to kick you through
[44:10] the door
[44:12] no
[44:13] he's a gentleman remember remember the
[44:14] holy ghost is a gentleman
[44:16] but if you let him in your house
[44:19] let him in your house
[44:21] and you say all right i got pride
[44:24] i'm gonna get this door open and i'm
[44:26] gonna get rid of that thing
[44:27] then you know what god will step in and
[44:29] take care of that all right if we let
[44:31] him your adoption is not your birth your
[44:33] adoption is your placing when you were
[44:35] born again when you're born of the
[44:36] spirit of god you're sons of god but we
[44:38] were predestinated
[44:40] now here's what i'm trying to get to you
[44:41] for the sons of the white of the last
[44:43] day that's us
[44:46] see we were predestinated unto adoption
[44:48] now here we are now this is what hurts
[44:50] pentecost a little bit and i'm talking
[44:52] about the pentecost in this message
[44:58] we were talking about last night we've
[45:00] had 60 years
[45:02] of journey way more than they had in the
[45:05] children of israel in in egypt
[45:07] 60 years we've wandered in the
[45:09] wilderness
[45:12] what what have we got
[45:13] people churches breaking up people
[45:15] quitting the message people preaching
[45:17] error preaching people can't preach
[45:18] anything but just uh god sent a prophet
[45:24] you think about it
[45:25] why we've been here 60 years
[45:27] brother brown said the rapture was
[45:28] overdue
[45:29] in the 50s
[45:31] 58 59 60 somewhere now he said the
[45:33] rapture is way overdue way past due well
[45:35] guess what now it's way way way way past
[45:37] due
[45:39] but i like what brother michael said
[45:41] brother michael said he said it was it
[45:43] was past due but he hadn't been born yet
[45:47] so god was waiting on him to get here
[45:50] that makes it personal
[45:52] he's waiting on me
[45:54] to come to a place remember brother
[45:56] brown says god's waiting on you he's
[45:57] waiting on me what adoption time we read
[46:00] this a long time ago
[46:02] but yet there ain't that ain't what i'm
[46:04] talking about he said fine
[46:06] you're a child of god
[46:09] but yet that ain't what i'm talking
[46:10] about see you were predestinated into
[46:12] adoption adoption is placing
[46:15] a son
[46:16] then we started on the three stages of
[46:18] adoption let's go through this real
[46:19] quick
[46:20] we'll slow down this afternoon but i
[46:22] want you to keep this in your mind
[46:24] and in your heart
[46:26] because there's three stages of adoption
[46:28] the first stage is the birth and in that
[46:30] birth it's three stages
[46:32] they're all right with that and that
[46:34] birth there is three stages it's always
[46:36] justification and sanctification baptism
[46:37] in the holy ghost i love what brother
[46:39] brown said you know there's a there are
[46:41] certain people in the message that just
[46:42] believes that when you you know you you
[46:44] got it all when you believe
[46:45] or that you didn't need nothing else you
[46:47] know you just
[46:48] boom there you are
[46:50] like we were talking last night most
[46:51] people
[46:52] most people in the christian world
[46:55] believe that god's just going to come
[46:57] just going to pick a random day and he's
[46:59] coming
[47:01] god's not random
[47:03] god's not random in anything he has a
[47:06] plan and a purpose for everything that
[47:07] he does so there is a red letter day on
[47:09] his calendar but you don't know what it
[47:11] is but he knows there's somebody going
[47:13] to come to maturity
[47:15] and somebody's going to fulfill not part
[47:17] of the word but every word of god
[47:19] amen we're going to do the things that
[47:21] we're supposed to do according to the
[47:22] bible but the first stage of adoption is
[47:25] getting you in the family
[47:28] we've been over that but let's go over
[47:30] it again you've got to get into family
[47:31] first don't worry listen don't worry
[47:33] about third pull don't worry about these
[47:36] words that we that we bring out of a
[47:38] full adoption don't worry about adoption
[47:40] until you get bored again
[47:43] when you know that you know that you
[47:44] know that god resides in your soul and
[47:46] look you're doing the abcs
[47:49] that's what we're going to talk about
[47:50] this afternoon we've been flew up to the
[47:52] headstone
[47:55] we don't got a a a
[47:58] doctorate degree in
[48:00] in message 101.
[48:02] by that time it's like 401
[48:04] right
[48:07] but we're still down here i can't read
[48:10] i i i can't do my i can't i can't one
[48:13] plus one's what
[48:15] and we're already wanting up here
[48:18] listen there is a way to get up there
[48:20] and there is a pull
[48:22] to get you up there but you got to go
[48:24] through we'll read this quote i think i
[48:26] may have it this morning if not this
[48:27] afternoon brother adam preaches on
[48:29] time-tested memorials but he also says
[48:32] time-tested christians
[48:35] i'm just a christian that's it
[48:40] no that just gets you started
[48:44] on your journey and every one of us have
[48:45] a journey and it's it's all different
[48:49] but it's one goal
[48:51] many spokes of the wheel but only one
[48:53] centerpiece that turns the axle all
[48:55] right same way with the word of god you
[48:58] can't get out of the word of god and say
[48:59] well i'm going to get bored again and
[49:01] this is the way i'm i'm going to act
[49:04] no when you get born again you should be
[49:05] acting like what god tells you how to
[49:07] act amen
[49:10] but that's what i'm telling you we've
[49:11] got people and and and i read a quote
[49:14] several
[49:15] several weeks ago where brother brown
[49:16] talks about teaching and he said it
[49:18] settles the people
[49:21] now right now there's a lot of churches
[49:23] that's not settled
[49:25] you can decide whether this one is or
[49:26] not
[49:28] but there's a lot of churches that's
[49:29] unsettled because you got that little
[49:30] group that says they're right on that
[49:32] edge well i don't know if if
[49:34] it seems like
[49:36] that that brother brown may be right but
[49:38] this group over here says we we can just
[49:40] need we just need to stay home
[49:42] because it's so confusing i agree
[49:45] i agree there's a lot of confusion out
[49:47] here
[49:48] but there is truth
[49:50] but there's a lot of confusion out here
[49:52] which makes people withdraw and say well
[49:54] i'll just listen to what brother brown
[49:55] said well you can for a while but you
[49:57] can't stay in the bible and do that
[50:00] you can't raise your you can't go up the
[50:02] statue of perfect man
[50:04] if you sit at home
[50:07] sorry
[50:09] and you know i'm tired of people making
[50:11] excuses
[50:16] look at brother golly i was thinking
[50:17] about when he was standing up here he's
[50:19] been doing this for
[50:22] 50 years
[50:25] 50 years
[50:26] you've been a christian that long
[50:28] because you've been in this church
[50:29] almost that long stands up here
[50:32] reads the scripture
[50:33] and i wish i could pray like he prays
[50:37] see that's my prayer warrior i know that
[50:39] man is talking to god
[50:43] why because he's been on a journey
[50:46] he's come now to the journey part to
[50:48] where he should be and he is i say
[50:50] should be he should be a seasoned
[50:51] veteran
[50:53] and you listen to people like that that
[50:54] are seasoned veterans but i appreciate
[50:56] god putting and see that's one of the
[50:58] gifts
[50:59] that's a positional place
[51:01] we want to have the speaking in tongues
[51:03] and the prayer lines and all that stuff
[51:04] the bible says nine spiritual gifts is
[51:06] wisdom
[51:07] faith
[51:09] all those different things
[51:11] and
[51:12] what brother brown say we always pick
[51:13] the lesser gift
[51:15] because why it gets emotional
[51:17] you know
[51:18] i really have never seen brother carly
[51:20] emotional i really want to when we get a
[51:22] body change i want to see your emotion
[51:24] that when that happens hey man
[51:26] brother colley's just been
[51:28] he's like an old he's like an engine
[51:31] steady is a rock
[51:33] that's why he worked for chevrolet
[51:36] the lord
[51:37] i'm not making that up
[51:41] romans 8 verse 14 for as many as led by
[51:43] the spirit of god
[51:44] they are the sons of god
[51:47] so how can you be led by the spirit of
[51:49] god and not do the things of god
[51:51] and do them and do them out of love
[51:53] don't do them out of well i better go
[51:54] church brother the way he's going to
[51:55] preach on me if i don't
[51:59] yeah that's probably true
[52:02] but you got to be led out of spirits by
[52:04] the spirit of god not led by my spirit
[52:07] you've got to be led by the spirit of
[52:08] god for yourself for ye have not
[52:10] received the spirit of bondage again to
[52:12] fear but you have received the spirit of
[52:14] adoption whereby we cry
[52:16] have a father i've seen people and and
[52:19] to get a good case of justification if
[52:21] you get a real case of justification or
[52:23] a real
[52:24] um
[52:25] repentant attitude
[52:27] uh that's good
[52:29] but remember that unclean spirit's still
[52:31] there
[52:32] and you're going to be bound
[52:35] this says for you have not received the
[52:37] spirit of bondage again
[52:40] if you're not born again you're under
[52:42] bondage i don't care if you're even
[52:43] justified and sanctified you're still
[52:45] under bondage because there's an unclean
[52:47] spirit that's in you
[52:50] it may be driven out but if you can't
[52:52] get the holy ghost in there the devil's
[52:53] going to come right back in there again
[52:56] amen and you're going to receive the
[52:58] spirit of bondage again to fear you know
[52:59] what you're going to be bound to
[53:01] a church
[53:03] a religion
[53:05] a denomination that's what you're going
[53:06] to be bound to you're not going to be
[53:07] bound to the beer joint
[53:09] satan's smarter than that
[53:11] he wants you to come to church
[53:13] but he wants you to think everything's
[53:14] fine we're okay we're good no
[53:17] listen
[53:18] i i think brother colly and brother dale
[53:20] brother darty and the different ones
[53:21] that's been here forever
[53:23] are y'all ever satisfied
[53:25] in spirituality are you ever satisfied
[53:27] no you're not you're not satisfied you
[53:28] always want to get that one little bit
[53:30] more that one little extra revelation
[53:32] that one little
[53:33] extra something from god
[53:35] amen we all do that and that's what we
[53:38] should do and not be just where we get
[53:39] the holy ghost and we lay down and quit
[53:41] fighting no that's just when your fight
[53:42] starts
[53:44] but he's give us the spirit of adoption
[53:46] though where we can move over and have
[53:48] some authority
[53:50] that's what we'll talk about this
[53:51] afternoon with with a positionally
[53:53] placed
[53:55] son and daughter of god there's
[53:56] authority that comes with that
[53:58] there's a name on the checkbook there's
[53:59] been able to drive the car there's
[54:01] joshua positionally placing them in the
[54:03] land and they establish their their
[54:06] borders
[54:07] they establish who they are i'm dan i'm
[54:09] ephraim i'm manassa i'm this i'm that
[54:12] and you stay where you're supposed to be
[54:16] cause that's your position
[54:17] all right everybody okay with that
[54:21] so now look
[54:22] now watch and the spirit itself beareth
[54:25] witness with our spirit yes
[54:31] if you're not born again your spirit is
[54:32] contrary to god
[54:34] i don't care who you are
[54:36] your spirit is contrary to god
[54:38] so the spirit beareth witness with our
[54:41] spirit that we're the children of god
[54:43] that's the new birth that puts that all
[54:45] together that we are
[54:47] not going to be but we are the children
[54:49] of god
[54:50] and if children let's move it over then
[54:53] heirs
[54:54] heirs of god and what joint heirs with
[54:56] christ whatever christ gets we get now
[54:58] what are we talking about we're talking
[54:59] about the son of man revelation right
[55:01] well that who was christ
[55:03] he is the son of man
[55:05] amen
[55:07] join heirs with christ look
[55:09] if
[55:11] f so be
[55:12] that we suffer with him
[55:15] amen
[55:16] that we may be also glorified
[55:18] together where was the suffering the
[55:20] suffering was in the son of man
[55:22] the suffering was not in the son of god
[55:26] it was in the son of man when god came
[55:28] down and got in human flesh that's when
[55:30] his suffering began everybody all right
[55:32] with that
[55:33] so that brings us the air that brings it
[55:34] down brother bob it brings us boom we're
[55:37] together
[55:38] he suffered we're going to suffer
[55:40] he was lonely we're going to be lonely
[55:42] he got cast out we got cast out he
[55:45] almost got stoned
[55:46] they stoned us with their words anyway
[55:49] but look it says though look that we may
[55:51] be glorified together
[55:54] glorified together
[55:56] all right
[55:57] now let's go to second peter one
[55:59] simon peter a servant apostle of jesus
[56:01] christ
[56:02] to them that
[56:04] kind of have a little of some kind of
[56:06] faith
[56:08] it says to them that have obtained amen
[56:12] the lights came on
[56:15] you've dug it out with god
[56:17] you've fought the battle god's fought
[56:20] the battle with you
[56:22] but you have obtained like precious
[56:24] faith which is now that's talking about
[56:26] this faith
[56:30] with us through the righteousness of god
[56:34] even our savior jesus christ are in and
[56:36] besides this given all diligence so
[56:38] besides this yes
[56:40] everybody with me besides this
[56:46] giving diligence add
[56:49] to your faith versus knowledge
[56:50] temperance patience godliness
[56:52] it's a requirement
[56:54] listen it's a requirement
[56:56] that you move it's your free will
[56:59] whether you do or not
[57:03] but you'll always be a weak christian
[57:06] sorry
[57:07] you'll always be a weak christian
[57:10] you may be born again you may be a son
[57:11] and daughter of god you you get all the
[57:13] you get all the blessings of god
[57:16] but you'll be a baby
[57:18] and what does babies do
[57:20] we have to change our diapers we have to
[57:21] feed them
[57:22] we have to powder them we have to pamper
[57:24] them
[57:26] that's why i believe brother dale's he's
[57:28] he's got some grown-ups because he's not
[57:30] pampered in baby this church like other
[57:32] pastors pampering baby churches
[57:35] hey he's sitting there i'm gonna give
[57:37] him his i'm gonna give him his crown now
[57:40] all right amen
[57:41] he built a church that don't have to be
[57:43] i'm so sorry
[57:45] pray for my children he's a pray for
[57:47] myself
[57:51] i'll help you pray but i ain't your pope
[57:55] that's what happens a lot in the message
[57:56] they try to get to you know they like me
[57:58] and bob was talking about you know
[58:00] you get forgiven of something and you
[58:01] still want to come through the door and
[58:03] and crawl on nails and
[58:06] we gotta learn to get rid of that thing
[58:09] and know it's under the blood know that
[58:11] god can't ever bring it up again oh
[58:13] hallelujah he'll never bring it up again
[58:16] he'll never bring it up to your presence
[58:18] again never
[58:20] listen there's no way he can even if he
[58:22] wanted to because his bible says he's
[58:25] throwing it in the sea of god's
[58:26] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[58:28] again
[58:31] but we still sat like
[58:33] like brother fernie wow zee wild you
[58:36] i'm having all these problems
[58:41] let's take care of the first problem the
[58:42] first problem is know that you're born
[58:44] again
[58:45] know that you've got the new birth not
[58:46] just anointing not just i come to this
[58:48] church i just i got a message
[58:50] that uh nobody else is god i got
[58:52] something nobody else has got
[58:55] listen that's the way i felt when i was
[58:57] 14 years old i'll just be real with you
[59:02] there's books and and and notes
[59:05] that i think brother tom kept some of
[59:06] them and gave them back to me their dad
[59:08] mom kept them for a long time where i
[59:11] read i read books i i circled stuff i
[59:14] wrote stuff down and i he just i thought
[59:16] this message ain't nobody else got one
[59:17] like this and i got the best message
[59:19] there is
[59:21] well
[59:23] you know who came came to the house
[59:26] knocked on the door and i let him in
[59:28] the devil
[59:29] so for about 20 years i served him
[59:31] instead of the word of god
[59:33] all right because i made a choice
[59:36] amen i made a choice it was a bad choice
[59:38] but you know what we make bad choices
[59:40] that just don't stay in those bad
[59:41] choices all right don't stay in the bad
[59:43] choices don't don't go around horeb
[59:45] yourself

[59:51] promised land and that's where i'm going
[59:53] to get put my victory is over there

[1:00:02] that when all the kings of the amorites

[1:00:06] act 238 i was going to quote
[1:00:08] that's our promise so joshua 5 verse 1
[1:00:11] we won't read all this to save time but
[1:00:13] remember what happened when the children
[1:00:15] of israel come out of egypt they walked
[1:00:17] in the wilderness for what 40 years
[1:00:20] all right and that wilderness was called
[1:00:22] what
[1:00:23] the wilderness of sin
[1:00:25] look in your bible
[1:00:26] it was called the wilderness of sin well
[1:00:28] that's what they walked in they walked
[1:00:30] in the wilderness of sin until what
[1:00:32] happened all those ice got out all those
[1:00:34] dathans and chorus and all those
[1:00:36] doctrines
[1:00:38] got bled out
[1:00:39] died
[1:00:41] and this new group rose up but they
[1:00:42] hadn't been circumcised
[1:00:44] and circumcision was really important
[1:00:46] because
[1:00:47] if you weren't circumcised you wouldn't
[1:00:49] you
[1:00:51] right
[1:00:52] god told them under abraham said this is
[1:00:55] your sign that you're mine
[1:00:57] as you do this circumcision
[1:00:59] on the males eight days after they're
[1:01:02] born so verse two says make sharp knives
[1:01:04] and circumcise sharp knives word of god
[1:01:08] and circumcise again the children of
[1:01:10] israel the second time
[1:01:11] so
[1:01:13] listen we've had a we've had a lutheran
[1:01:15] age we've had a wesley age we've had a
[1:01:17] pentecostal age we've had a and i want
[1:01:20] to say beginning of the message age
[1:01:24] brother branham was was preaching to all
[1:01:25] different denominations trying to get
[1:01:27] them all together trying to get him to
[1:01:29] see the message of the hour but remember
[1:01:31] he preached all the
[1:01:33] i was listening the other day in
[1:01:34] california he said you sisters
[1:01:37] he said i come out here every year and i
[1:01:40] preach on hair and dress and he said you
[1:01:41] get worse
[1:01:43] well what was it they weren't getting
[1:01:45] his message
[1:01:46] they were getting the feeling from the
[1:01:48] healing
[1:01:50] right they were getting they were
[1:01:51] getting a feeling from the discernment
[1:01:54] but the greatest discernment was him to
[1:01:56] look at them women and men and say
[1:01:57] you're not living right
[1:01:59] you hadn't lived right to begin with
[1:02:00] that's why pentecost failed that's why
[1:02:02] they said no oh no i can speak in
[1:02:04] tongues it doesn't matter if i cut my
[1:02:05] hair it doesn't matter if i you know
[1:02:06] commit adultery it doesn't matter if i
[1:02:08] do this it's just this over here i speak
[1:02:10] in tongues
[1:02:11] brother brown said they stopped right
[1:02:13] there
[1:02:14] but there had to be another set
[1:02:16] circumcised
[1:02:18] there had to be another group that come
[1:02:19] up
[1:02:20] that not just the circumcision of the
[1:02:22] holy ghost down here you know that that
[1:02:24] circumcises you here but i see holy
[1:02:26] spirit right here
[1:02:28] i see the
[1:02:30] the apex of the holy spirit here so
[1:02:32] there there's a circumcision a cutting
[1:02:34] away of the skin
[1:02:36] in the journey this is what they're
[1:02:37] doing they're getting ready though they
[1:02:39] went through the journey they're getting
[1:02:41] ready to go in the promised land and
[1:02:43] actually they walk into the promised
[1:02:44] land this is when they were stepped over
[1:02:47] jordan into the promised land right
[1:02:50] and
[1:02:51] god reminded joshua
[1:02:54] said look man
[1:02:55] these people have not been circumcised
[1:02:58] if they're going if i'm going to
[1:02:59] positionally place them you know what he
[1:03:00] was god was saying
[1:03:02] to me
[1:03:03] they're gentiles
[1:03:07] listen to what i'm saying
[1:03:10] and
[1:03:10] because i told you
[1:03:12] my people
[1:03:14] the jewish race is going to circumcise
[1:03:16] on the eighth day and that makes you a
[1:03:19] jew that puts you under
[1:03:21] the the protection of abraham i guess
[1:03:24] you might say the promise i gave abraham
[1:03:26] was that if you're circumcised then
[1:03:28] they'll be a part of me well there was
[1:03:30] so many thousands of
[1:03:32] people 20 and under
[1:03:35] that he didn't consider israelites and
[1:03:37] they were fixing to positionally get the
[1:03:39] property they were supposed to get
[1:03:41] what am i saying get it right
[1:03:45] even though we have to stand and as i
[1:03:46] said before and you make a joke out of
[1:03:49] it but men ought to understand what i'm
[1:03:50] saying
[1:03:51] at eight years old or eight days old
[1:03:53] you're not gonna remember that
[1:03:54] circumcision but when you're 20 years
[1:03:57] old you're going to remember that
[1:03:59] circumcision so that's the same thing in
[1:04:01] our journey you're going to remember
[1:04:02] when god circumcises your heart
[1:04:06] in this journey god
[1:04:08] cut the foreskin off and then let's go
[1:04:10] into the promised land let's go take
[1:04:12] what we're supposed to take
[1:04:14] and joshua did that remember he did the
[1:04:18] verse seven and their children whom he
[1:04:20] raised up in their stay of them joshua
[1:04:21] circumcised
[1:04:23] i was thinking about this the other day
[1:04:24] it's kind of what we were talking about
[1:04:26] this
[1:04:26] uh last night
[1:04:28] everything reminds me to me there was a
[1:04:30] pivotal time there in
[1:04:32] in the seals when brother ryan was
[1:04:34] preaching the the up to the sixth seal
[1:04:36] and then he had questions and answers
[1:04:37] and he told the people you're not
[1:04:39] getting it
[1:04:41] it's not for you
[1:04:43] okay
[1:04:45] they got stuck in the promised land
[1:04:47] right on the border
[1:04:52] because remember a type of that you take
[1:04:54] uh what is it
[1:04:56] a half tribal manasseh and the other two
[1:04:58] tribes they stayed on this side of
[1:04:59] jordan
[1:05:00] now they went across and helped them
[1:05:01] fight but brother brown said that was a
[1:05:03] type of luther wesleyan pentecost or
[1:05:06] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:05:07] holy ghost
[1:05:10] so that's what happened they went in and
[1:05:11] fought but they came back out
[1:05:13] listen i don't want to fight and come
[1:05:14] back out i don't know why they did that
[1:05:16] well you know there's a story behind it
[1:05:18] but but i want to take in that prom my
[1:05:20] promised land was on that side of jordan
[1:05:22] mine and your promised land is on that
[1:05:23] side of jordan what jordan is what a
[1:05:25] type of death my property is going to be
[1:05:27] over there
[1:05:28] but you got to die out to yourself first
[1:05:30] you've got to have verse seven their
[1:05:32] children whom he raised up in their
[1:05:33] stead them joshua circumcised for they
[1:05:36] were uncircumcised because they had not
[1:05:38] circumcised them by the way and it came
[1:05:40] to pass when they had done circumcising
[1:05:41] all the people that they abode in their
[1:05:43] place in the camp till they were whole
[1:05:48] in other words until they healed
[1:05:51] that's the same thing with you coming to
[1:05:53] church
[1:05:57] it don't hurt to sit at home and listen
[1:06:00] or watch
[1:06:02] because you can just kind of filter out
[1:06:04] you know the cat can walk by or
[1:06:07] right
[1:06:08] but when you're in church and you got to
[1:06:10] look at me or you got to look at
[1:06:11] somebody and they start walking down
[1:06:13] your aisle and stepping on your toes
[1:06:15] they something got to happen there's a
[1:06:17] reaction that's got to happen
[1:06:19] amen so when we're circumcising up here
[1:06:22] on sundays and wednesdays
[1:06:24] when we're doing the the the work of
[1:06:26] circumcision it's going to hurt
[1:06:30] but listen you're going gonna walk
[1:06:31] different
[1:06:32] you don't walk the same way you walked
[1:06:34] before
[1:06:35] and it does hurt but listen look what
[1:06:37] they had they went on in verse 11 god
[1:06:39] didn't say no i'm just going to throw
[1:06:41] them away no they began to eat the whole
[1:06:43] corner of the land or they began to eat
[1:06:44] more nutritious food more of what had
[1:06:48] already been planted in the land
[1:06:51] right manis east
[1:06:53] the old corner of the land came in other
[1:06:55] words
[1:06:57] i'm going to say this
[1:06:58] the miracles were over
[1:07:02] the the the hand to mouth
[1:07:05] bless you
[1:07:09] nurse
[1:07:10] the hand to mouth
[1:07:11] the hand to mouth was over you're not
[1:07:13] babies anymore i'm not gonna let your
[1:07:16] clothes not rot
[1:07:18] i'm not gonna give you water that runs
[1:07:20] with you every day
[1:07:22] i'm not gonna give you manna that you
[1:07:24] just hold your hand down and it hits
[1:07:25] your hand and you eat it you're going to
[1:07:28] work for it
[1:07:31] now we know that brother bible's talking
[1:07:32] about rest
[1:07:34] there is a rest but when you get born
[1:07:35] again that's just rest in your soul
[1:07:38] the fight's over inside but the fight
[1:07:39] starts on the outside
[1:07:41] and man it's the same way with them in
[1:07:42] the promised land listen elijah i mean
[1:07:45] elijah joshua didn't tell him say look
[1:07:46] now you just walk in over there and you
[1:07:49] just tell them who you are
[1:07:51] and they gonna just all fall dead
[1:07:54] right that's what we think
[1:07:57] that's what happens when we have a good
[1:07:58] meeting like you know
[1:08:00] sunday a couple sundays ago
[1:08:02] i don't say we have
[1:08:03] bad meetings but the spirit of the lord
[1:08:05] fell
[1:08:07] and you could feel it even last sunday
[1:08:08] when we were up there in ohio you could
[1:08:10] feel the spirit of god
[1:08:11] settle into the building
[1:08:13] and people were worshiping not
[1:08:14] worshiping because the neighbor
[1:08:15] worshipped or not worshipped because of
[1:08:17] neighbor worship they worshiped because
[1:08:18] god had come to them
[1:08:20] god had come to them and not anybody
[1:08:22] else
[1:08:23] all right and whatever situation you had
[1:08:25] that you were praying about
[1:08:28] did it get settled
[1:08:32] bruce
[1:08:33] got settled didn't it
[1:08:35] you see what i
[1:08:36] mean that's telling you that the fight's
[1:08:40] over
[1:08:41] but you gotta fight a battle first
[1:08:45] you don't just walk in
[1:08:46] and and uh we were talking about
[1:08:48] something the other day and
[1:08:49] you know people have a uh
[1:08:51] a tendency even in the message
[1:08:54] to to put preachers up on the pedestal
[1:08:56] and and you know unreachable and
[1:08:59] and uh you know he's so holy and
[1:09:02] you know listen when i got called to
[1:09:03] preach
[1:09:04] when brother dale got called to preach
[1:09:06] brother bob different ones got called to
[1:09:07] preach by the aaron brothers
[1:09:11] our bills
[1:09:12] kept coming
[1:09:18] i delivered a lot of them myself
[1:09:22] and and my grass just didn't stop
[1:09:25] growing in april
[1:09:27] and never grow again until october
[1:09:31] and brother brother bob's car never run
[1:09:33] out of gas
[1:09:37] huh
[1:09:38] and i go out in the garden and i work
[1:09:40] and and the mud would just fall off me
[1:09:44] never had to take a bath
[1:09:48] you're saying someone's saying you know
[1:09:49] what i'm saying
[1:09:50] we always think if
[1:09:52] the reason i'm saying this is because we
[1:09:54] have a position
[1:09:55] but you also have a position
[1:09:57] deacon's elders
[1:09:59] all y'all
[1:10:00] have a place positionally placed but
[1:10:01] don't think because you're positionally
[1:10:03] placed you just stepped into a bubble
[1:10:07] right
[1:10:09] what brother brown say when you get born
[1:10:10] again
[1:10:12] satan turns every gun
[1:10:15] right to you and i mean he doesn't just
[1:10:17] go
[1:10:21] no he said
[1:10:22] [Laughter]
[1:10:25] hey man
[1:10:27] am i hitting something
[1:10:29] so this positionally placing in the
[1:10:31] promised land even though according to
[1:10:34] that scripture right there
[1:10:36] according to the scripture turn it back
[1:10:37] to verse one please
[1:10:40] we'll get into the second stage this
[1:10:42] afternoon go back go the other way i'm
[1:10:43] sorry i don't know which way that me and
[1:10:45] daddy don't have directional let's go
[1:10:48] go to verse 1.
[1:10:52] look it came to pass when all the kings
[1:10:55] of the amorites all their mites
[1:10:57] and they were on the side of jordan
[1:10:58] westward and all the kings of the
[1:11:00] canaanites which were by the sea heard
[1:11:01] that the lord had dried up the waters of
[1:11:03] jordan before the children of israel
[1:11:06] until we were passed over that their
[1:11:08] heart
[1:11:10] melted
[1:11:12] neither was their spirit in them anymore
[1:11:16] because of the children of israel
[1:11:19] our problem is
[1:11:21] it's like brother gary atkins always
[1:11:22] said
[1:11:23] he's a bluff he's a bowl with no he's
[1:11:25] got a bow with no arrows
[1:11:27] when we get up in the morning we hand
[1:11:28] him a fistful of arrows
[1:11:30] say here shoot me
[1:11:33] even though he's got the bow and he's a
[1:11:34] bluff
[1:11:35] here shoot me devil
[1:11:37] but that's the same way there then then
[1:11:40] if that would have been able to be put
[1:11:42] into a a message book
[1:11:44] it already is but if that would have
[1:11:46] been put in a message book
[1:11:48] that would tell you whatever fight you
[1:11:50] was going to have they didn't have no
[1:11:51] fighting to begin with
[1:11:54] same way with the devil remember we in
[1:11:56] the scripture i believe it's in ezekiel
[1:11:58] where we look at this man laying on the
[1:12:00] side of the road a drunks laying in his
[1:12:02] own vomit
[1:12:04] and we say is this the man
[1:12:06] that caused me all this trouble
[1:12:08] that in other words that ruled the
[1:12:10] nations that caused the battle of
[1:12:12] armageddon that caused the battle that
[1:12:13] we all fight and he's nothing but a
[1:12:15] sought drunk laying in the land in the
[1:12:16] street
[1:12:19] i know devil hates that but you know
[1:12:21] what if you believe the bible he's
[1:12:23] already written and that's going to
[1:12:24] happen
[1:12:25] and he's not even going to judgment he's
[1:12:27] going to be stuck in the lake of fire
[1:12:28] before the white throne judgment
[1:12:30] according to the bible
[1:12:31] because he's already been judged all
[1:12:33] right so there was no fight in them but
[1:12:36] remember even though there was no fight
[1:12:38] in them they still had to fight
[1:12:40] there was no there was no
[1:12:42] there was nothing
[1:12:43] jericho man
[1:12:44] even rahab said look when y'all crossed
[1:12:46] that river and we heard y'all crossed
[1:12:47] that river and god opened up the waters
[1:12:50] that was it
[1:12:52] we didn't know how he was going to win
[1:12:54] this thing but we knew that god was with
[1:12:55] you
[1:12:56] that's why that when all these times
[1:12:59] that god or the people were trying to
[1:13:01] build the temple the natural temple it's
[1:13:04] been destroyed like 17 times
[1:13:06] in jerusalem that's why they're trying
[1:13:08] to build it back again
[1:13:11] but the whole why does the whole world
[1:13:13] hate israel
[1:13:14] just because they're jews no
[1:13:18] they are the people of god
[1:13:23] bible tells you that now whether they
[1:13:25] were divorced and put away and they
[1:13:27] they've they're not bribed anymore
[1:13:29] that's not the world's not thinking that
[1:13:31] they're thinking
[1:13:33] if this is the children of god
[1:13:35] and they get that temple built back
[1:13:38] they're going to be more powerful than a
[1:13:39] nuclear warhead
[1:13:41] because they're going to have god and
[1:13:43] they're going to have miracles that's
[1:13:44] why all them people around them hate
[1:13:46] them they don't want to build nothing
[1:13:48] they don't want to get back restore
[1:13:50] israel back to its its prominent power
[1:13:53] why because like i said before that when
[1:13:55] you read in the book of
[1:13:57] of ezra and different ones they had a
[1:13:59] sword in one hand and a
[1:14:01] trial in the other hand the people
[1:14:03] around them knew
[1:14:05] the cities and the countries around
[1:14:07] jerusalem knew that if they'd ever built
[1:14:09] that city back they were going to become
[1:14:11] powerful
[1:14:13] and they didn't want to do it now that's
[1:14:14] the same way with me and you
[1:14:16] build your wall with a trial in this
[1:14:18] hand and a sword in this hand
[1:14:20] amen
[1:14:21] know that god's told you you've got a
[1:14:23] position and that position is that
[1:14:24] you're a child of god
[1:14:26] and that you will have authority to
[1:14:28] build what you need to build and to
[1:14:30] destroy what you need to destroy
[1:14:33] that's what we got to come to folks
[1:14:37] but their heart melted
[1:14:40] if we really realized it
[1:14:42] if we really come under the power of god
[1:14:45] satan has to tremble
[1:14:48] he can't stand that anointing not that
[1:14:50] kind of anointing now he can stand all
[1:14:51] anointings all them good feelings and
[1:14:53] all them good things but he can't stand
[1:14:54] the word of god in power
[1:14:56] he can't stand that because he can't get
[1:14:58] either one
[1:15:00] he can't get the word he can't put the
[1:15:02] word together and he can't get that
[1:15:03] anointing that you and i have on us he
[1:15:05] would have been jesus if it had that
[1:15:07] same anointing but i thought that
[1:15:08] anointing was on me and you
[1:15:11] so the rest of us just going to be a big
[1:15:12] fight
[1:15:14] and it's going to be a fight until we
[1:15:16] get out of here
[1:15:17] listen we're going to squeeze out of
[1:15:18] here we're not going to go out on the
[1:15:20] flower bed of ease we're not going to go
[1:15:22] out on the broad highway we're not going
[1:15:24] to go out and everybody's patting us on
[1:15:26] the back side boy y'all doing good
[1:15:29] no they're going to hate us like they
[1:15:30] did jesus
[1:15:31] they're going to put us to death they
[1:15:32] don't have to do it spirits i mean
[1:15:34] naturally they do it spiritually
[1:15:36] amen
[1:15:38] but there's a temple being built
[1:15:41] there's a temple being built
[1:15:43] not with hands of man
[1:15:46] but a body
[1:15:48] a body of flesh
[1:15:50] with an outer court
[1:15:52] an inner court
[1:15:53] and a holy of holies
[1:15:55] amen and that's where god wanted to
[1:15:57] reside right here in that holy of holies
[1:16:00] sure he sure he had things on the
[1:16:02] outside the menorah and the different
[1:16:03] things but inside that holy of holies
[1:16:05] was one thing
[1:16:07] that was the word of god
[1:16:09] and god came to that word of god we were
[1:16:11] talking about that uh
[1:16:13] in ohio last week about solomon
[1:16:16] when that
[1:16:17] listen
[1:16:18] the shekinah glory didn't come
[1:16:21] when the art was
[1:16:23] over here
[1:16:25] because it was out of its place
[1:16:27] it was still the word of god
[1:16:29] but when the priest picked it up
[1:16:32] all right they go through the outer
[1:16:34] court
[1:16:36] solomon's already built this great big
[1:16:37] temple
[1:16:39] it's beautiful
[1:16:41] man it's got pearls and i think the
[1:16:43] bible even says gold and silver that you
[1:16:45] couldn't even weigh it it was so much
[1:16:47] they overlaid about everything in gold
[1:16:50] here they come in
[1:16:52] they're singing
[1:16:53] they're praising god
[1:16:55] they come into the
[1:16:56] outer court they come into the inner
[1:16:58] court
[1:17:00] it's kind of glorious still not there
[1:17:04] but when that thing went in and the
[1:17:05] bible says they turned
[1:17:07] and they set the ark down
[1:17:09] and then they pulled
[1:17:12] the staves or they pulled the poles
[1:17:15] they pulled the poles out that means it
[1:17:17] was going to stay right there
[1:17:19] that thing got into its positionally
[1:17:22] placed
[1:17:23] spot
[1:17:25] and when it got into that spot what
[1:17:26] happened
[1:17:28] the bible says the shekinah glory came
[1:17:31] in that building so much so the priest
[1:17:33] had to shut up
[1:17:34] the people had to shut up
[1:17:36] and the power of an anointing listen and
[1:17:38] this was just wood
[1:17:40] and paper
[1:17:42] and a little bit of stone
[1:17:45] that's all it was
[1:17:46] but god said that's where i put my name
[1:17:49] god should do the same thing with me and
[1:17:50] you we've been through justification
[1:17:52] sanctification now to baptism the holy
[1:17:55] ghost and the priests are pulling the
[1:17:57] staves out
[1:17:58] and what happens is that curtain falls
[1:18:00] down like this and when it falls down
[1:18:03] you don't go back there anymore
[1:18:06] but now what did they tell us in the new
[1:18:07] testament though
[1:18:11] it's all open now
[1:18:12] we have an open book we have an open
[1:18:14] altar we have an open holy of holies
[1:18:17] because we walk around in that
[1:18:19] holy of holies
[1:18:20] never all right
[1:18:22] but that's what you have to look at
[1:18:24] we look at that we see that god is you
[1:18:27] know what god did he challenged solomon
[1:18:30] to build that temple
[1:18:32] because see david was commissioned
[1:18:33] david's one that said hey i want to get
[1:18:35] i want to have it built
[1:18:37] but who built it solomon built it the
[1:18:39] son
[1:18:41] of man
[1:18:42] built it
[1:18:44] the temple the right temple the one that
[1:18:47] was exactly the way god wanted it wasn't
[1:18:49] just a now remember the one in the
[1:18:50] wilderness was temporary
[1:18:53] hello
[1:18:54] the one in the wilderness was temporary
[1:18:56] he had badger skin and they had to
[1:18:58] overlay it with this and and they had to
[1:19:00] haul it and it was always covered with
[1:19:01] something
[1:19:02] they'd set it down in the middle and
[1:19:03] they camp around it which was good but
[1:19:05] david said in other words i've had
[1:19:08] enough of this carrying around i live in
[1:19:09] a house
[1:19:11] i live in a real big mansion
[1:19:14] and god's out there in the elements
[1:19:16] underneath that
[1:19:18] badger skin and all that different
[1:19:20] colors
[1:19:21] i want him to be in here
[1:19:23] you know what he said i want him to be
[1:19:25] comfortable
[1:19:27] where he's at
[1:19:30] so god said i know you have a desire
[1:19:33] i know in 1963 the prophet told you
[1:19:36] you had a desire to sit under that
[1:19:38] ministry
[1:19:39] everybody with me
[1:19:42] but god said you can't build that house
[1:19:45] too much bloodshed
[1:19:50] too much bloodshed
[1:19:52] but the sun
[1:19:54] is going to build the house
[1:19:57] the son of man
[1:19:59] is going to come in human flesh
[1:20:01] and build the house
[1:20:02] and then he's going to go back
[1:20:04] and then he's going to come back on the
[1:20:05] day of pentecost as the son of god and
[1:20:07] they're going to go out according to
[1:20:09] court holy of holies but
[1:20:12] i'm not satisfied there
[1:20:14] i want you to build me this big temple
[1:20:19] make you look like a pyramid
[1:20:23] and my son's going to build it
[1:20:28] and then he's going to come back in the
[1:20:29] end
[1:20:32] he's going to pray read the prayer of
[1:20:33] solomon it's a beautiful prayer we read
[1:20:36] that thing sunday and it just everybody
[1:20:37] fell apart
[1:20:40] a man a human man stands and gets on his
[1:20:42] knees with his hands raised to god he
[1:20:44] said god these are your people
[1:20:47] and we've done exactly what you've told
[1:20:49] us to do
[1:20:52] have we done exactly what he's told us
[1:20:54] to do
[1:20:56] if you have
[1:20:57] then you can say uh
[1:20:59] and then god can fill that holy of
[1:21:02] holies with so much power until you
[1:21:05] can't say a word
[1:21:07] there's nothing can be said nothing can
[1:21:09] be added
[1:21:11] what is
[1:21:12] the seventh seal
[1:21:15] there was silence in heaven
[1:21:17] about the space of a half an hour
[1:21:20] the shekinah glory had filled the room
[1:21:22] full there was nothing else to be said
[1:21:25] there was nothing else to be revealed
[1:21:27] everything happens
[1:21:29] a secret though
[1:21:31] because remember there were many nations
[1:21:34] around israel at the time but he made
[1:21:37] solomon so powerful
[1:21:39] till there's no army could defeat him
[1:21:43] oh hallelujah
[1:21:45] there's no army could defeat him and
[1:21:47] then he built the temple
[1:21:50] and it was not a hammer or a saw
[1:21:53] nothing they made those pieces give them
[1:21:55] the dimensions
[1:21:57] eleven hundred of them
[1:22:00] come on somebody
[1:22:02] eleven that we've been giving 1100
[1:22:04] sermons
[1:22:05] that you don't have to saw it up
[1:22:07] you don't have to beat it with a hammer
[1:22:11] you just what
[1:22:14] put it together
[1:22:16] fifo ministry we'll put it together and
[1:22:18] then we will what we will enter that
[1:22:20] temple
[1:22:22] and be not just look at the shekinah
[1:22:25] glory
[1:22:26] we will be the shekinah glory we will be
[1:22:29] the one that anoints that temple in in
[1:22:31] the millennium that we're going to talk

[1:22:34] next saturday or no next first saturday
[1:22:37] of the month but that's what we're going
[1:22:38] to be
[1:22:40] we're not going to be somebody standing
[1:22:41] out here
[1:22:44] i thought we were already inside there
[1:22:46] but he's just going to just keep piling
[1:22:47] the shekinah glory on top of us

[1:24:57] not only that then but he's doing it now
[1:25:00] all right let's read number nine
[1:25:03] oh i wish i had the ability to grind
[1:25:05] that into the people's hearts
[1:25:07] god is looking for a time-tested
[1:25:10] christian
[1:25:11] every son that cometh to god must be
[1:25:13] tried
[1:25:14] child trained tested and you who jump
[1:25:17] from pillar to post
[1:25:19] let me stop just a minute
[1:25:21] and you who jumped from pillar everybody
[1:25:23] believed brother brown was a prophet i
[1:25:25] don't think i asked you that today so
[1:25:27] some of you don't
[1:25:28] how many believe brother brown was the
[1:25:30] prophet
[1:25:31] oh thank you more of you some of you
[1:25:33] woke up
[1:25:35] and you who jump from pillar to post and
[1:25:37] this to that
[1:25:41] let that soak in
[1:25:42] this to that
[1:25:44] and in
[1:25:46] and out
[1:25:48] that just got of all of us didn't it
[1:25:53] how god can ever adopt you into his
[1:25:55] family or positionally place you that's
[1:25:56] a question mark in other words he's
[1:25:58] questioning how in the world if you jump
[1:26:00] from pillar to post this and that up and
[1:26:01] down in and out how can god ever adopt
[1:26:04] you into his family or positionally
[1:26:05] place you
[1:26:07] now think of that for a moment how can
[1:26:08] you be positionally placed when you will
[1:26:10] not stand still long enough for god to
[1:26:13] do it
[1:26:16] god let me stay still one time just long
[1:26:18] enough
[1:26:20] let me stand still one time and let me
[1:26:22] see
[1:26:23] my position
[1:26:25] musicians come
[1:26:26] we'll get on to a little bit more this
[1:26:28] afternoon
[1:26:31] but god
[1:26:34] he said brother we're not supposed to
[1:26:36] stand still
[1:26:37] well we ain't supposed to run out in
[1:26:39] front of the program of god either
[1:26:42] be still and know that i am god i think
[1:26:45] that's what you're looking at on the
[1:26:46] backside of that beam right there but
[1:26:48] how can you be positionally placed
[1:26:50] listen one more time i'll read this
[1:26:51] again every son that cometh to god must
[1:26:53] be tried child trained and tested and
[1:26:55] you who jump from pillar to post
[1:26:58] and this and that and in and out how can
[1:27:01] god ever adopt you into his family or
[1:27:03] positionally place you now think of that
[1:27:05] for a moment how can you be positionally
[1:27:07] placed when you will not stand still
[1:27:09] long enough
[1:27:10] for god
[1:27:12] to dress you
[1:27:13] let's stand our
[1:27:16] feet you love the lord
[1:27:20] he's trying to get us to come to a place
[1:27:24] where he can use
[1:27:27] you
[1:27:28] we listen we've been used by the devil
[1:27:31] long enough
[1:27:33] hello somebody we've been used by the
[1:27:35] devil long enough let's turn ourselves
[1:27:37] over and be used by god
[1:27:39] [Music]
[1:27:40] let that thing as again one more time
[1:27:42] let that thing out
[1:27:44] use that gift that god's given you don't
[1:27:46] ever
[1:27:47] suppress the gift that god gives you you
[1:27:49] need to pray about it
[1:27:51] but don't tell me you got a gift and
[1:27:54] you're in and out up and down
[1:27:56] pillar to post
[1:27:58] unsettled
[1:28:00] somewhere you got to be settled
[1:28:03] and listen then if you do that
[1:28:06] what's god obligated to his word
[1:28:09] he's not obligated to your thoughts or
[1:28:11] idea i don't think i need to go to
[1:28:12] church that much well that's not what
[1:28:13] god said
[1:28:15] i thought if we obeyed the word of god
[1:28:19] maybe some of our troubles will be over
[1:28:22] and we're all human beings we all do the
[1:28:23] same thing once we start getting in
[1:28:25] trouble what do we do
[1:28:27] we quit coming to church
[1:28:30] am i loud enough
[1:28:33] we quit coming to church
[1:28:35] we get in our little pity party our
[1:28:36] little shell
[1:28:39] when you should be under the anointing
[1:28:41] of the of the preacher and the and the
[1:28:43] fellowship in the church
[1:28:47] [Music]
[1:28:49] but you know what we've been preaching
[1:28:50] this for 50 or 60 years and people still
[1:28:52] as soon as trouble happens they head off
[1:28:54] somewhere
[1:28:57] no
[1:28:58] stand still
[1:29:00] be still
[1:29:02] and see the glory of god be still and
[1:29:04] watch your jordan part
[1:29:07] be still and watch the water come out of
[1:29:09] the rock and that water which is christ
[1:29:12] and let him follow you through your life
[1:29:14] and let him nurse you every time you
[1:29:15] need every time they need some water
[1:29:17] they just

[1:29:20] go
[1:29:20] what about a river that followed them
[1:29:22] through the desert if they went this way
[1:29:24] the river was right there beside of them
[1:29:25] and it wasn't a little trickle because
[1:29:27] it fed two million people and their
[1:29:29] animals
[1:29:30] so it was a gusher of water but every
[1:29:32] day they could just dip their little
[1:29:33] dipper in it and drink the water
[1:29:35] that's what god will do for your life if
[1:29:37] you'll do what he says
