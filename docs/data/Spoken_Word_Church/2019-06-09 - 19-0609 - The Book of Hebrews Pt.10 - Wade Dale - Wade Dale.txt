========================================

in first but I trying to help brother Bob and some of the other one and if I gave my life with that it didn't make you better it just made me dead right but Christ died knowing that that life he had which was eternal life that life could come right back into Bob and make him don't come for bid make you me made manifest in another form if I was one day die if my life could come back on you and make you better that's why snuff it's not that way well that we Christ had to do that for us so he sent us a we be like him not like each other all right has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto man once to die but after this the judgment now if I see that word appointed it is appointed unto men once to die there is what an appointment drawl says to be reserved to be laid away laid by reserved for one awaiting him appointed there's an appointment that we must reach for men to die but after this the judgment now this is my take on all this it is appointed unto men once today it didn't say every man's gonna die it's appointed unto man once to die there's an appointment with death brethren even talks about that there's an appointment with death that you and I have to me but they somebody not gonna make that appointment and then you have an appointment to go to the doctors more you can break that appointment and knock don't believe that God still can not though you can do that so that's what I'm gonna believe that I support another man wants to die but I'm not going to that point okay but after this the judgment so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation they appeared the first time physically his second appearing was on the day of Pentecost to go into the heart of the believer to give them salvation because there was no salvation look we'll read this new will quit will stop really early today for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect for then when they have not have ceased to be offered in other words when in one day up the priests waltz in one day and eat this makes the sacrificing doctors forgiving everybody and starts living in them and no they didn't happen because he have coming release the life itself because that the worshiper once purged should have had no more conscious the sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sin every year right here's your answer the invite says anything well yeah they work perfect in the Old Testament no they weren't or they had their sins take away no the Hendersons covered for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sing not possible they taking blood of all the notes can take away sin I will stop with their Google everything every books today not seven for somebody one day one day I will get work late for every house you know what [Music] about rape fight but oh well nobody will say it was is it usefully that women with blush and not even look at a man of blah blah blah now they just so boldly no blush so anyway was but it's not each what do you say well you don't see just don't say it much all right we're on Hebrews 9 we have been talking about the tabernacle and milk as a date and let's drop back to Hebrews 8 verse 10 for this is the covenant that will make with the house of Israel after those days saith Lord Oh put my laws into their mind around them into heart now remember the first covenant was United tabernacle you had the three-room Tabernacle all you had two out of court in court holy holy it was a physical building and what he's saying now is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days another act of the days that they did all these sacrifices I will put my laws in their mind and write them in the hearts because they weren't in the heart in the Old Testament they were just rituals they were something you went by able to do the don'ts and and all that and I will be to them O God and they shall be to me people who I've been reading back in chronicles and Kings and man they didn't do nothing said they'd have one King and do good and then half forward that was do evil and then they would tear the Groves down and they build oh my god and the problem I got with this whole thing is is even the good Kings didn't take care all the Groves down right they still have to grow up on the hill I don't know with a great girlfriend knock them down but they always left that Grove up on the top of the hill up there and that was always a pain and usual side because the next king to come by and have supper sacrifice living just bring them down here and start sacrificing to Moloch or whoever else the person in it but now remember God's going to be their Pig god they're going to be the people of God they still are the people of God but not every one of them are there's going to be a hundred forty-four thousand that's going to be the people of God coming up math right not all in Israel he was dealing with all Israel at this time back in the Old Testament but now you come into the New Testament Paul is trying to remember remember what Paul is doing Paul is dealing with Jews and Gentiles he's trying to get the Jews to see sacrifices are not any good anymore the temple is not any good anymore there's a better thing a new covenant which is the New Testament which Paul was trying to preach to them this is the New Testament this is the new thing runs them put my law in your heart and not put the law in in a book and put it in an ark and I think that's what we come to now I was talking about the clock yesterday we had a group of that time talking about people still going by the law they're still one of my books they've not moved into that new covenant the new covenant is it that you were gonna be a God we're gonna be the guy that God wanted so I wanted God's your God Adam first Adam when he brought Adam he said you got here I've got heaven he wants us to be God's well they couldn't be God's in the Old Testament well he couldn't hurt hiding their heart the only way for you to be a diet for God I probably come to Perdition well we we don't want to be like God the only that you know any say you hear song to be like Jesus to be like Jesus don't do it there won't be like it right but if you are Jesus Christ made manifest in another form color run then you will act exactly the way God wants you to have it man alright and you don't have to read that's gonna hurt you don't have to read the Bible to act to some people read the Bible to act do it some people read the Bible just eat the do's and don'ts but to get the essence of it is for garbage speak to you in your heart in your mind we'll talk about the sacraments a great mystery which is Christ in you the hope the boy mm-hmm and they shall not teach every man its neighbour and never man's brother now what happened was in the Old Testament what happened in the Old Testament they had the horrible they had the commandments of God and I would sit down ask the father of them of the family and I would teach Josh the do's and dont's then when I got over passed away Josh would teach his children the do's and don'ts okay and that's the way it passed now that's what he's talking about here he's not talking about they shall not teach every man his neighbor no words well you don't keep no really today today I'm not here to teach you I'm just saying words if God does speak to you I'm gonna get into that the sacraments voice of God if you don't hear the voice of God you're just listening to a man and he can be wrong but the voice of God can never ever be wrong hammer anima that's where we can put our faith in brother ground center face final resting places in that word all right so whatever brother Brown says that they say it's contrary to the Bible the legends about he said what the policy right and we didn't I had to put my faith on that that that was the voice of God now it's not the voice of God when they tell you to soul seven thunder you've made twenty five people you can do this you can do that right that's not the voice of God the voice of dark not even telling you they don't listen to the day so that's not the Boise God that's no way to say that's all well you're not going for a Bible thing all right so yep yep if brother Graham said it it's God compared with the Bible if it's not it's not the voice and done pretty simple huh and you shall not teach every man his neighbour and ever man's brother saying know the Lord for all shall know me why God's going to speak personally now to each person when he come onto that Pentecost and that's a great thing you got Peter Peter was the most contentious man in Jesus's life he was always doing the wrong but he was always standing up and saying I'm gonna do this and I'll do that but God taught some less of that though he used him on the day of Pentecost to preach the first sermon and three times when people got saved now I'll try that okay Peter said let's go meet with him brother Claude read that sermon men and brethren this thing Jesus whom you crucified he throwed a trap Oh the people who you crucified God has made both lordy Christ in other words that won't freak their hearts a civil man you're speaking as a goggle because remember they spoke so much as they died till they made Paul Paul they made one of them earth three and one of them whatever the God they made them died they put God into the ex-wife well they did the same thing with brother Graham now he's not big guy but he's a total time for all of you though but I will be to them so and they shall be to me of people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor like I said in other words I don't have to sit you know Bob's dad said don't bother the Oracles we've gotten involved tell them the lack exactly when he gets mad and he'll know we go and we listen the daughter self individual that's what I said you've got to hear the voice of God individually for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities where I will remember no more all right he's fixing to do away by Daniel seventy weeks by the state slow purpose make an end of sin reconciliation for iniquity and all those things he's going to do to Israel just like he does to us right that's the total plan of redemption and that he sets a new covenant he hath made the first fold now we don't do it was Old Testament cuz it's plenty of time plenty of shadows but you can't take them tops all the way you can't get a prophet in New Testament to go marry a prostitute and have children but in the Old Testament God told the Prophet we go matter you prostitute and have children and she'll and even come back they had some more kids so that's you can't go that far stay but brother Brown said he said the Prophet knows when to start a time and went in the top so that brother Branham gave it to us being prophetic people we can take a example in the Old Testament and take the type of where it needs to go on and stop all right and somehow its own took it on the well we're playing we come from new testament and then they all come from the old testament and it was legal under that covenant but this is a new covenant right a new covenant he have made the first over now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away but the old temple so here we go to Hebrews 9 then fairly the first covenant had also orbits is of divine service and a worldly sanctuary are a earthly sanctuary not worldly like we say worldly right that word day if you look at it right there it says and earthly sanctuary which was true when there was a tyrannical made the first wherein was the candlesticks in the table and the shoeprint which is called the sanctuary so we know that's made but you know what that exactly times justification sanctification baptism and all we go that's the updated new covenant that we're under now we're not under the Old Covenant we're under the new testament jesus said in my blood right and after the second Vail the tabernacle we just called the holiest of all because so you got you out of court your air court and the Holy of Holies everybody got that all right Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden censer in the Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with Dover where it was a goal pot that had manna and Aaron's rod that budded and the tables of the Covenant and over it the chair of the glory shouted the mercy seat of which we cannot now speak particularly in other words just gone they can't find it it's not anywhere members not in the temple some back took you more in detail okay because really under Paul's tenure he's trying to get him away from that he's been trying to get him away from that box with all this stuff in it you know he's trying to get them away from that to say that is now inside of do you know piece of wood or but now at one time you got you gotta take your top though at one time that art was coming from one city to the next city and it almost fell all over the car and what would we do if we saw something holy getting ready to fall we would immediately well you know what got killed it man right right God killed that man why because he wasn't under the Old Covenant it was do's and dont's all only the Levi's could touch it he wasn't Oliva and he was a good man he was actually one of the two guys that brought it from this country to the net so you got a like like said you gotta watch your tops but the man touched it and should not him and God killed him God want to kill the kabobs a duck killer no I don't think so I think he was just he would just he had to die because the water said he said no I touched him nobody touching these things that believe us and even the Levite remember the Levites had to turn around when they put the stage then the Levites had to turn around to get the thing up and I look at it had to be it was so holy why because God was teaching us that it come from that down to right now now the same thing if you look at Paul and the ones like that you see Paul kind of the way God moves you see Paul now Paul being the holy of holies man took garments awesome Paul and give them to people like we do prayer cloths and God healing well to me there's there's your Tabernacle had moved into flesh and now everybody it can come boldly to that throne everybody can come and receive of that gift that Paul had and that you and I have anybody with the Holy Ghost is God help me now when these things were thus ordained the priests were always in the first time in that will accomplishing the service and God out of court pretty much it you go in and out of court you know the list of the court it's open right but into the second went to high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered first for itself member preacher has to be the first particular it has to be the first one to get cleaned and then they were buddy behind me right and for the errors of the people or the sin though that goes this stick of mind that the length of the holiest of Hall was not yet made manifest all right the Holy Ghost did not come to go inside the people right while as the first tabernacle it was yet standing you see what that means that means that while the first time when Apple was standing no one got the Holy Ghost in their soul no one while that Tabernacle was standing there God was at that Tabernacle he was in the tabernacle he was telling them to do what to do but when that Tabernacle became God in human flesh in Jesus Christ he done away with that Tabernacle that tower handle was done away with a man why would you think though the curtain was ran from top to bottom they should have known them them you should have known if it was rent from bottom to top you could say well somebody walked in there and did it but that thing was took from the very time that same like 20-something feet high ain't no short not way up there that same comes down and goes all the way in the bottom from the top to the bottom showing brother Brown said when that Oakland of course I know you know it's just a story show he said when they opened that curtain up so you can see Jesus Christ names on the cross now I don't know if it's true or not but it would be a symbol of that would be Christ on the cross and the bail being rent from top to bottom so the Holy Ghost distinct affined that the way that the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while it's the first time when angle was yet standing look which was a figure something to look at a figure for the time then present Old Testament in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect there if people would read the Bible just read the Bible that what does the Holy Ghost do that makes you perfect inside there was nothing in the Old Testament to make you perfect that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience inside him the conscience which stood only in meats and drinks I was reading about in Chronicle when Solomon rebuilt the temple and brought the Holy of Holies in the Bible said they sacrificed so many animals that it was the number became you couldn't number many more thousands of sacrifices they did and then what the solomon do he sent him home with meat bread and wine he said everybody in israel home with meat bread one alright so that was but that was a symbol of the preachers today brother Dale is going to give you meat bread and wine okay and he's not seeing you home okay and that's kind of the way it was but they did it naturally but today we're going to get our meat and our drink spiritually from ministry all right which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation but Christ being come an high priest of good things to come by the greater and more perfect Tabernacle now you'd think that was really pretty out there that Solomon built this and you read for how many tons of gold tons of brass and silver but you know well that's all I have now don't you think since this in the baguette tons of stuff the whole inside of the holy always was lined with gold so when Titus comes in and tears that thing apart and he just takes it all back to two of the morrow all right into the Vatican but look by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle it was him in his flesh I don't see why that's why I keep over it over again your flex don't sin your flesh is just holds you ducks in that hope you hold it it helps you to it what it does is it keeps all that spiritual stuff inside of you right that's what it does the firing mechanism thank it saturnine but look a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is the same out of this building though was it Jesus Christ standing there in human flesh or not of this creation because neither by the blood of bulls and goats and calves because remember those lives those are just lives that's just nature they don't just go away and there's no way that that life can come back and make the person pure and make the person holy right no way but one man but by his own blood what the life is in the blood that life it was in Jesus Christ did come back home the believer and not just ol number them but his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us now show me in there where it says but not for your body like we've run into okay come on the label good grief if Jesus swiftly if what he did can change his body if he's inside of you it's gonna change your body we just got to believe that not believe something else not believe somebody else that this is just an old and it isn't okay you know why sometimes now you know my brother Graham coated the past now till they stink it's rotten it's gonna die if we don't think about a change just know things hurt they didn't hurt the horn remember I said we'd get up and chips now be good buddy try try to roll over and get to the end of the bed we're used to Deanna you know she just said if she wakes up she's 100 degrees and Mandan still one will be there in a minute but that's why they that's why it's called the pest as it's not called a pest house cause you're living in it cuz if you're God in human flesh that's God and you know what when he takes over that's God's flick neither the blood of goats and calves I believe it's now this but by his own blood the internet wants them to the holy place having them eternal redemption for us for if the blood right here's your your answer to them look for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more show the blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God there's your answer let them purge your conscience from dead works to serve living done and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament New Testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament they which are called might receive the promise of an eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also necessity be the death of the testator that's why they call it a new testament right because the testator is one that brings you bring something to you all right and he's got a guide to make them a New Testament so he can bring it you you know I can't give I can't give sure I could probably give all my inheritance to Josh but I'm still alive I gotta have something for me to live off okay until then but when I pass away there is a new covenant made and that covenant or that inheritance goes to your for your family members particularly your son you've done the Old Testament son where a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth that's why Jesus didn't save one soul by living on earth no one he's all what about Paradise blood you don't remember that wasn't a new birth that was a fair enough that was him in parting eternal life to the thief on the cross No I don't see the Bible in a little field even the woman at the well that brother branham talks about the spark of eternal life she didn't get eternal life then in there if she did see the guy before the disciples then it would have broke the scripture Jesus Christ had to die before eternal life could go into somebody's soul don't care what anybody says it's what the Bible says okay brother Branham was giving us an example of how the spark got lived but she didn't get eternal life right then I promise you the Bible said that yes that's that's why we come to church that's why we have somebody get up and teach but you can't get it on phone yo her Testament is the force after men are dead but couldn't be a New Testament until the testator and died otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth remember the New Testament remember that's one if we cover the New Testament didn't start the book a man here our mark or Luke or John that's not the New Testament that's part of the Old Testament the New Testament that Jesus is talking about is the book last when Peter stood up and said this Jesus whom you crucified God has made him both Lord and Christ indeed when they were pricked in their heart 120 got the Holy Ghost the New Testament started on the book in the book of Acts acts 2:4 the New Testament started that's love otherwise Paul's telling you this oh why this is of no strength while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first Testament was dedicated without blood we know that was the blood of bulls and goat where when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of cabinet of goats with water scarlet walled hyssop sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the Testament which God hath enjoined unto you but now what did they do it did not make the him eternal people with God it did not make them born-again believers so they went right out and just what I said if you read all of Kings the first King second King Chronicle they sacrificed their kids to Moloch then they did they didn't do nothing got cold what are they working all right saying this is what the Testament wants done have been joined I'm thinking they do then commanded God had commanded underneath he did it now see those were the commandments when God went to Mount Horeb he gave that command much to Moses Moses brought down but remember what brother Brown said brother Graham said they thought they got a book of rules but they got Jesus Christ why because the only somebody with Christ inside of them can live with those ten command if people never do live the Ten Commandment she had good people you had bad people you always going to have that but no one attained to eternal life in their soul in the Old Testament instead of Adam and he was imparted it wasn't it wasn't a new birth he wasn't more wrong indeed born right right that's why Jesus kept telling Nicodemus you must be born again that was never spoken in the Old Testament because there's no way you can be born from your mother's womb by sexual desire and be clean but now Paul's telling us we can by the blood of Jesus Christ right saying this is the blood of the Testament which God had been joined into you are commanded moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry now look there was there was tons and millions and millions and millions of tons of blood goat blood I mean look this thing that looked nice and look when they put Christ on the cross program see little I can burger me well if you take Solomon's Temple and you think oh this is such a clean place that killed probably a hundred thousand animals have you ever i'm molested deer hunters and one animal makes a lot of mess because you got think the intros valid you got to cut them in half and you got a good public old gut up and you got it it ain't pretty blood running everywhere blood splattered all over everything but that's what christ looked like when he went with the cross but he did that one time so he doesn't have to do that again but what they did every year they went back through the same thing they cleaned the place up they did it again clean the place up and do it again but they didn't cure affine here to look and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding a blood is no remission there had to be shedding the blood our forgiveness and God did God did he didn't he didn't take their stand completely away in the Old Testament brother round city one he pushed it to Calvary he covered it and pushed it to Calvary but now watch it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than date from Christ is not entered into the holy place made with hands which are the figures of the truth like I said they are examples right there is a candlestick this an example there's a shewbread this example that's all our examples of what we need to do in our life but it's not something to purify all right but Christ is not here there the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear have done for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entered into the holy place every year with the blood of others for them must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world in other words Christ didn't soon as I haven't even what they did Christ didn't have to be killed over and over all down prison no he's a substitute which was the animal the substitute of the animal is the one that Satan entered and calls to follow right so the animal had to be sacrificed for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world had the appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself so he came as the ultimate sacrifice and he being the total ultimate sacrifice I mean I if I come in here today and of course I try to stop the bullet
