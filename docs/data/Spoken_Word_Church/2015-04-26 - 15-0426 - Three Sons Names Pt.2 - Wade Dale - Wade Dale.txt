TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what's going on so did you get your supper did you get your supper did I get one yeah I have lost almost 30 pounds it's a shirt I've lost 30 pounds you're out of him man but yeah I've been over you've been hanging around oh people too long all right let's go to I want to read I want to read a scripture here let's let's go back over here I didn't put all this together because I don't know how to do all this like Bob and everyone knows how to do it but let's go to John and let's start we go into three sons name that's what we've been talking about or what we kind of give a preview last Sunday all right and I hope you enjoy this because I'm real this this brings in Genesis one it brings in the creation brings in a lot of what brother Nails already been talking about but we're gonna stay on the titles of the three sons name which was what son of man Son of God Son of David now that is not a complete order because brother Brown starts with Jesus Son of Man then Son of God Spirit God and then he goes to son of David well we know the son of David is going to be in the Millennium we'll talk about his characteristics later the son of man was the one that was on the Earth but the Son of God is the one before the foundation of the world all right so we're going to read this and then we're going to read something that brother Brown said and then we're going to kind of put the picture in because watch this because in the beginning was the word and word was with God and the word what was God turn on electronics okay in the beginning what's the word a word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God so there's not anything different it's the same all right all things were made by him as a person it wasn't made by what man would say a light or a spirit but this Spirit man has formed he's a human if we're Made In His Image God has never been anything but a human form right that's right amen and we're going to read where brother around said nobody's seen God at any time and that's the truth I'm not seeing you I'm not seeing the real you right the real you resides inside all right all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so we know that whatever this was so let's go to this word thank God for Bob showing me this program and putting it on here I like this because you do cross reference what's that word right there low guys all right now that's a big word that's actually a little word but watch the meaning of it's of speech a word uttered by a living voice embodies a conception or idea all right because remember watch what the word logo means right yeah what is the word logo it describes what your business is right the logo oh okay lights are on now well look that word is logos that word comes from the root meaning oh we brought it in the logo which is what we put it up this is our logo this is our you know Matt down State Farm Act it describes who he is and what he is but logo shows but remember but remember it's just a form of the business it's not the whole business yeah right it's the logo listen don't have it but you know you see a little thing stuck funeral home or whatever it's the logo all right what the word that describes your business same way with logos it's the word that describes God conception or ideal now we don't we know that God's not a conception God is real right okay he's not just an idea he's the only idea he's the word period he's the only word all right now look what someone has said a word the sayings of God now what God is doing here watch what God's doing and you'll see the you'll see the very Foundation of why God had to come from brother Brown will say great Eternal cover all space Time and Eternity and he steps into logos why not that God can understand us so that we can understand the logo of what his business is and what he's fixing to do yeah everybody got that same man this is going by I don't want to run past anybody but that's the logo that's what is coming forth that God is being able to represent in word now what he is because I want somebody to Define eternal we can't conceive that right right can you really honestly can you conceive never beginning when you go back 10 billion billion billion billion years there's somebody stood when you go back more years never somebody stood that's right when you go 10B million years that way there's somebody stands can you right can you comprehend that though no you cannot comprehend that I cannot comprehend never having a beginning and never having an end in my Humanity that's right let's just be honest when it says then the word was with God you automatically think you know outside of God right but the word now that you're talking well see what the Lord our son the logos came out didn't come out of God and make a separate person but it was with God because what watch this here's here's the here's an analogy June and I are developing a logo for Daleville Farms or Daleville bee farm now what that is is the description of the business right but where did it come from it came from my idea and her idea and then being put into word or into script right decree mandate or order the what Old Testament prophecy given by the prophets with the logos obviously that was for Christ we're going to talk about that a little bit later but I love this one this um definition here you know that's of speech a word under by Olivia was now what it is we had this conception in our mind embodies a conception or idea we got this idea now remember let's go back to what brother Brown said brother Brown said God had a plan right and a purpose where did it come from he said let's go back in the back part of God's mind because God can't do anything to help us understand him without going the same way we understand how we live here just like Jen and I sat down we go okay we're going to sell this kind of product we're going to do this now it's not in Word it's not developed yet it's an idea right but when we do Daleville bee farm obviously one thing's for sure it's got to have to do something with beef and honey and maybe some of the other things that go along with it right you see how this is developing well see you don't understand that unless we tell you right right it's our idea and we know all the if ands and buts about it we know every bit of it we can see the conception or idea but one day it's going to become embodied in a store or an online is that okay you know we're going to develop that and then we're going to show it we're gonna show it to the people yeah that's the same way God is because you can't understand what we're thinking about but when we take what we have yeah and either put it on paper or a logo and then we begin to develop that then you're going to be unable to understand the conception same thing with Microsoft same thing with apple and although they started with nothing but just a simple arithmetic that's all it is there's only 10 there's only 10 numbers zero through nine right it's just a combination of those first computer I ever saw I was at Guilford High School Guildford high school girls were grammar school and a guy comes by and he says this is a new thing and he takes and he's got a little pad with a cup and he's pouring um marbles or something in the thing well the computer's counting it like only go from zero to nine and it just Loops back over again well over here it's tallying it up to me that was what it was a plan somebody had a plan then they were getting ready to develop look what it developed into computers now you don't even need to wire anything up phones that work anywhere you know Bob's watch and get emails in his watch now they got an apple there's an Apple or Google uh watch everybody's got one now okay well not everybody and they have Google Glasses what did that come from listen to what I'm saying that come from and just somebody sitting down like Dave Ramsey Dave Ramsey's 20 something years ago broke bankrupt didn't have a what we talking about telling how to pop the do nothing in cooking but now he's now he's a president of a 30 million dollar Corporation in 25 years he said it started at a card table with me and my wife we'll see what was he doing he was like logos he was writing it down he was the great one that had this great mind of course it's limited God's not but our brand is limited but whatever idea we have that's what we're gonna do now with man we make mistakes so you can't use the whole analogy but you can still see the concept are the conception the concept was God is so great nobody can understand me so I'm going to develop down yeah same man right but I'm going to develop down first by low gospel because logos is my logo that's what I'm going to show to the people because what that word was what finally was made Flash now that's the son of man but you got to go back up here we got to stay with the Son of God but that word right here what is declared a thought declaration aphorism a weighty saying a discourse the act of speaking or speech The Faculty of speech now it's not here's Here's my thought it's what brother Brandon was talking about because remember when God ever speaks it has to happen right right so he had to have the thought first because when he starts speaking it it's going to happen it's not like me and you like Jen and I sitting down trying to develop a develop a logo and develop a list and develop that well we're throwing out 5 000 different ideas God's got one idea God's got one plan hey man he knew everything so before he could say anything that plan had to be saw he had to see the plan amen he had to see it by foreigners he had to see that whole plan then he could begin to speak that plan into existence because remember sure he was logos he was Son of God he was all these things but you have to take what brother Brown says and go all the way back to where he was covering everything let that mean God was just like a vapor right no God was a man yeah yeah he was a human he's the only human that ever lived amen but he had a plan and a purpose because inside of him June and my desire is is to get product out so people can purchase it same way with God but remember in God we can't purchase it he had to come and purchase it for us right then he give it back to us right remember the quote Jesus didn't come to bring you an inheritance your inheritance was before the foundation of the world he just came to make a way to you get back to your American right because we got l-o-s-t we got lost okay but this to me was wonderful once I was seeing this where that God and you know the difference in God thinking and speaking it because remember when he thought it he's no more older than when he thought it than today right explain that that's how the word was with him that's what I'm getting that's correct that's right that's right that's right it resided in him right right it wasn't with him beside him because you can go on through a little bit more and they'll talk about this is not it but there's a oh yeah right here because watch it says in John denotes the essential word of God Jesus Christ and personal wisdom and power and Union with God his ministry and creation and government of the universe the cause of all the world's life both physical and ethical which for the procurement of man's salvation put on human nature and the person abused on Messiah the second person in the godhead well you know can we just spit that we need to spit that seed out and just keep on eating the pie right just spit that seed out because remember they didn't have a revelation like we did right okay this comes from Strong's Concordance okay excuse me so they they identify him as the second person in the godhead coach when they do say with God that's what they say that it was with God another person but it's not it's the same person just moving over into a form that he can say Let There be okay is everybody okay with that but when now when you see the word logo think hello God sometimes you wouldn't want to put that together but but he does describe what's behind the sign yeah amen I mean it describes what's behind the sign right okay everybody got that say amen amen all right everybody win that so in the beginning was the word sometimes it helps somebody sometimes we like I said before sometimes we read that like a newspaper get this program and and just mask your finger on that word and it'll pop up the definition and the cross reference which is Strong's Concordance I like that because sometimes the words don't exactly mean what it shows what we think it means right because see the same was in the beginning with god well did God have a beginning no God never had a beginning but brother Brown did say go ahead of the beginning but look origin origin right the first person or thing in the series The Leader okay so he's a leader that by which anything yes a feminine noun all right okay so look up these things sometimes but look all things were made by whoever this is all things were made by him right all right so it has to be God could keep that thought forever and ever and ever and then but once he drops down into the logos or speech he begins to speak that word and he can't be taken back he's already thought it out in his mind everything's perfect it's going to happen that way but it's going to happen because he for an instant look down through time saw everything that was going on that's see to me that's I can't understand how that somebody in India 600 years ago God knew that who that man was what he was going to think there's six billion people in the world right now God knew every one of their thoughts for the foundation of the world he knew what they were going to good and bad yeah he knew what their life was going to be and you the day they were going to be born the day they were going to die now how in the world are we going to understand that kind of a guy unless that he comes down and narrows his self down so now we can take this great Eternal and we can say well now he's beginning to speak so he is beginning to show himself our logos he's beginning to speak what he has in his in his heart okay okay what's the name of the problem huh yeah Bob Bob hold on man go back something it's um let's see all right get this thing back to the back to the beginning yeah I reckon it's uh it's got all it's got a bunch of different Bible translations even the Korean Bible t-e-c-a-r-t-a Bible okay and it's an app obviously it's an app you can get for I guess okay and don't worry these are Deanna's they're not mine yeah sure are you sure all right no but no but that that right there that's mine right there get out of there quick all right now let's go here to the quotes let's watch what brother Brown says here there's a Bible part that goes there's another Bible that comes with your with your tablet but it does not have the strong support it's in it this one has the strongest quartz and several translations of the Bible so I love that um if we look up here logos now look all right let's let's let brother Brown develop this and questions and answers on Genesis let's read verse 21. now if God created man in his own or paragraph 21. now if God's created man in his own image and his own lightness what kind of a man did he create Spirit man now if you'll notice after he made all the creation and created Spirit man we're gonna we're gonna read this down and then go back all right that God gave dominion over the cattle and the fish and everything to the man but it is making up there he made him in his own image to lead the cattle so now who was Adam Adam was the first man in the Lord creation okay all right he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creation oh sorry the lower creations of God the first creation was God himself there you go oh wait a minute remember look up that word creation that word creation means fashion like I said before automobiles were in the Garden of Eden this computer the components of this computer was in the Garden of Eden you say how in the elements right amen right you were in the Earth right your body was at your 16 elements never changed from the time of the beginning down to now right but what did man do Man created an automobile out of all these parks that were already here so when he says God created man or the first creation was God himself no it's just like I said it's God putting everything together so that we can understand it all right nobody understand that right he fashioned he fashioned the first fashion was God himself had to have an image to start with right right because there had to be a man made in the image of God I saw the image of God had to be okay got it yep okay same like I said like an automobile Man created they can't save it they say well Henry Ford says I created the automobile sure he did but he didn't he's not God he can't take nothing and he can just say car right he had to take the Earth the things in the Earth the chemicals the rubber the plastic the metal The Ore the iron and put it together and say Here's my creation right right here's my creation right uh sister Gabby that um uh cake last night he was a creation it wasn't anywhere it was in the ground you say how's that come from sugar milk eggs right take it back people on this just as simple as it can be your body the same way brother Brown said always 16 other ones 16 other ones 16 elements right and to me the cosmic like that he's always talked about is that firing mechanism that's inside of you that in the beginning God created everything and man fashioned everything from that country right that's correct but we say creation yes Apple computer was created by Steve Jobs well technically yes it was but it was more of put together it's always been here right television's always been in within the Garden of Eden brother Brown said right because it's a vision right Moses had a vision right he had a computer screen pop up and there he saw what happened in the Garden of Eden I don't believe that God handed him a piece of paper and said this is what happened the Bible or man says Moses wrote Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible so God just opened a vision like I said about brother Branham he would be standing in front of somebody and you see him in that movie you see him kind of move his eyes kind of move away from the person or up above him what's he doing watching the screen yeah he's he's a table being by a doctor and you've got cancer on your left breast well he's standing there watching it just like it's a movie that's the vision man has just took him perverted it making it television but it was always in the Garden of Eden it was all it's always been amen Isaiah I saw them you know train of the yeah in the temple I saw the trouble what's he doing he's looking at a vision he's letting something opened up in front of him and he could see it I think they literally see these things I don't think God just put a premonition in his mind right no I think they saw brother Branham Eve had blonde hair blue eyes Adam's shoulders was a little broad with shoulder length hair he was watching the whole thing remember he's the eagle that goes up above everything and can see just as far this way this way this way this way right so God put him in a vision I want you to if you can if you can find it we don't have time to get done um Google George Smith on YouTube and he does in 2011 he's when brother Jeff Jenkins was still in the message he had George come up and for about two hours almost tell his story of his story of brother Brown coming up from horny brother Branham and and he George goes back to the 1945 when he was born and brings up where his mama and daddy went to Mexico and he grew up in Mexico and lived in Mexico for 20 something years and and then he goes and meets brother Branham and he said all these different but what there's a lot of Supernatural things that he said a lot of things happened he said that brother Brandon would tell me and I'd be like and then years later it happened he said well brother randomly said when I walked up he said well around was looking in a vision he was seeing what was going on years later even brother George when he received he told Brother George he said you cannot marry my daughter to you and my daughter receive the Holy Ghost he said he was in Texas with brother Perry green just la la line out you know just spending time and you know and but he got to pray in one night and said he felt like everything was settled he said the next morning brother Branham called him at seven o'clock I believe it was that morning and said brother George I want to be the first one to congratulate you on receiving the Holy Ghost he said now how'd that man know that all right he said God told him he said now you can marry my daughter so of course they didn't get married I didn't know this I thought brother Brown married them but he didn't they got married after brother round and got killed uh several months after Bill Brown got killed yeah they were married I think California brother George was in the Army he was into Vietnam War yeah but do I protected him in camping during that time so but go to that it come from bro what's the name of that church brother Chad Lounge church now uh BC Fellowship Believers Christian Fellowship but put George Smith in and put in YouTube and it'll come up and it's about an hour and 30 minutes or so and he's done a real good job of just telling this story he wasn't trying to present no Doctrine but he was telling the story of how he met brother Brown and all the supernatural things that went on during that time and a lot of things that Rebecca told him that I didn't know he's a lot of things Rebecca told him that happened before he even met her all right but look in other words let's read this quote and then we'll go we're gonna stop right here and then we'll take off because we're going to take a trip here but look he was in other words Adam the first man of the Lord creation of God first creation was God himself everybody okay with that that doesn't stump me okay then out of God comes the logos now what is the law the speech the logo what's fits into happen what I've got in my mind I'm fixing to bring it so you can see it which was the what Son of God so the Son of God is before everything before there's even a um an atom or anything he's always been the Son of God Amen he's always been the son of man he's always been these things all right he's just what developing or fashioning them all right because remember Revelation 3 14 says the beginning Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God the beginning of the fashioning of the way God wanted to be had there not been a fall then out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was word words with God's word was God and the Word was made flesh is one among us out of the logos came forth the man so what was the logos the one that was speaking in Genesis 1. God said let us make man in our own image right okay all right let's stop right there amen thank you
