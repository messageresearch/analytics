========================================

over in South Carolina I'll not call his name but he's preaching on the statute of perfect man also from birth to adoption is what he called it from birth to adoption okay so he's been going and he really rejoiced in in that uh in that point that we've been doing the same thing and I didn't know this but brother Lis said he went back and tried to find out when I started and he thought it was last year it was February 2013 is actually when we first started on the statute of First Command that's been almost two years this coming February be two years so well you take 60 something this is number 67 so yeah that's a good bit anyway just we need to just trust the Lord and don't pause it turn it on thank you just trust the Lord that he will uh he'll make this thing live CU it's a requirement right right and it's refreshing to see and it's like the brother said and he he made a wonderful point he said I believe this is the centerpiece of the message yeah and I believe that this is the centerpiece of the message cuz it is the foundation of all the message all them 100 sermons it is the foundation cuz you have to start with the foundation stone to get this one here and it's like he said he said he said well I'm glad you took that much time he said because if you don't get the foundation right the building will crack fall warp right but if you got that foundation on real good solid rock real good Revelation then you know what it's a little bit better to go up through these these virtues so let's read right here I think we kind of stopped right here these fellas wasn't required what these fellas are now what he's talking about these fellas these fellas wasn't required they weren't required Luther wasn't required to come to here Luther's m message was the just shall live by faith these fellas wasn't required what these fellas are this wasn't required what this was see but he brought his church up the same way he brought his church up the same way he brings his people up Peter says here first seven things Faith virtue knowledge temper fa God brotherly kindness as brotherly kindness then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Spirit now does anybody need explaining of that I know there's still a confusion in the message when brother brandham says that they think you have to get all the virtues and then you get the Holy Ghost cuz it says the true baptism that doesn't mean you got a false birth down here you got a true birth down here what happens is is the holy spirit can add more to you and has been adding more to you up through the pyramid so it's the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you get all these virtues sealed in you now it doesn't say you get all these virtues see what that one word would do then you get all these and you get all these virtues virtues in you see if you read it read Now read it read it like somebody else would read it holy ghost comes upon you and the baptism of Holy Ghost and you get all these virtues in you that seems to me like you got to come here before these virtues come in you but he put sealed in you they are you got to be in there before they're sealed right G not the holy spirit of God were you're sealed till the day of your Redemption you don't seal a truck when it's empty yes sir we would fill a truck full of chicken and we'd shut the doors and we'd seal it so something it was already full of something okay so it was full of virtue and all the temp place god brother kind and it seals you Holy Ghost comes upon you that's right because you already having in that's right it comes upon you it's it is another anointing it's an anointing that is different from your new birth your new birth makes you a spirit bab in Christ this does not this he said then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him that's right no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonating any gift that God's Got You might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of Faith but when these virtues grow in and you add that to that then you are a living Monument you're a living moving Idol and then he talks about the you know people the imaginary gods and that's what they have romanism see that that's romanism but when we not I like this one right here but when we not in an imaginary way so there's no imagination to this all right but when we not in an imaginary way but prostrate ourself before a living God a living virtue living knowledge living patience living godliness living power coming from a living God makes a living man a Living Image in the stature of God what's he doing the same things that Jesus did walking the same way he walked doing the same things he did because it's not imaginary thing there's a reality that proves it is what is the reality the way you live your life the things you do when we get finished with this you ought to know exactly where you are in this pyramid that's right you ought to know exactly where you are in this pyramid and then you need to start working on it cuz see I can't give it to you I can make it available and I can make the way open for you to get there but you got to go out there by yourself it's an individual affair with God first thing thing you got to do though is you got to get under a teaching that actually teaches that okay cuz cuz most don't and I was talking to that brother too when he was I said brother I said I I if you say it's a centerpiece I said I won't hear anybody preach me he said no brother they don't but he told me he said he said I know they're a requirement he said I'm trying to teach my people that it is a requirement see what I mean see how these virtues these Building Material types in the church age Messengers with the church ages and one of these days we're going to take each one of these words which he did now that is the house that God dwells in not a building with a big belt but a body has thou prepared me body that God can dwell in walk in see in talk in work in living instrumentality of God God walking in two on two feet in you glory footsteps of the righteous order of God God walking in you for your a written epistle and if the life that's in Christ be in you you'll bear the life that Christ bore all right let's skip going over a little bit let's read this one right here I like that and now we put the blood of Jesus Christ in see and that brings the faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ right got it the love of God which is Jesus Christ he's the head and controls you and your feet is the foundation Faith controlled by the head take the there you are there is the perfect man of God when he possesses these virtues then remember God represents his bride as a bride as a person that says my feet moves why because my head says so now it can't move like my hand because it's my feet Luther can't do the things we did neither can Methodist because they were something else the feet moves because the head says so and the head never says now feet you become hand ear you become eyes see that's what our problem is when the message now we got people we we're not in we're not in line brother when we realize who we are well if you're an ear be an ear your finger be a finger if your leg be a leg you know but each age God has placed these things into his church and patterned it by showing that each individual has these possesses these qualities and this being when it's complete is the Church of God going to Rapture and this being and completed is a servant of God and the Church of God is going in Rapture see what I mean there you are there's the full thing here comes Paul he and now he watch he goes through this CU I want you to see how it parallels Church AG here comes the man Paul laying the foundation cuz brother Brown said Paul was the pattern Messenger right pattern messenger Foundation right Paul laying the foundation irus began to pour this into to it the next one poured this the next one poured this next one that that that on down till it comes to the last stage but what is it it's the same Spirit everybody got that it's the same Spirit the whole stature of your being is governed and controlled by these things but it cannot be completely controlled till it completely possesses these qualities you understand that you can't be completely controlled until it completely possesses these qualities in other words you can't you still got the power without character did you ever hear this now let me tell you this keep it real put this in your listening ear a chain is it strongest at its Wist length all right anybody understand that I got a question uhhuh on um 357 now we still have premoral agency whether we are filled with all these virtues right but it's still easier for God to control us at that point well if you come to right here you've lost a lot of your free will okay a lot of it that's right cuz your will becomes his will okay see because Jesus was standing there with the headstone he said not my will but thy will be done okay not my will but thy will be done you got it okay yeah I mean sure you you got free moral agency to stop any of this and and not have all these full virtues like we've been teaching but as you get further and further up what's it doing Mar and even listen even when we're finished with this we're going to get into another part even when you finish with this brother Brown says you still got to take like Michelangelo he finished that statue of Moses but it still looked kind of rough brother Brown said he took and he polished it till it shined then he' go polish the other side till it Shine so see God's you get up to he God still he's got to polish you off that's right cuz even brother you know brother Brown 1963 we believe he become this complete image of God he was still a human being he still had problems he still had things he had to work on but he had lost a lot of his Free Will okay is that what the persecution is going to do probably do some of it yes cuz the bride does better under persecution I mean right now what do we need he so confident like we were talking about what do we need yeah we all got good jobs we all got this we all got that you know as you're going up the statute of perfect man you're obtaining each step as you go up the more you increase that your free will decrease that's correct I believe that I mean that's just the way I believe because you'll always be a free moral agent cuz brother B said this will always be sticky cuz remember your memory reason conscious affection and Imagination God can come through there and so can the devil mm mhm but remember it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside right so he's inside here trying to push that junk out of those flu he's pushing that memory toward him not toward Satan but now listen if you let Satan get in your memory and start playing Holy Ghost is a gentleman he's going okay right I'll go out on the limb and sit here for a minute Prophet said that right he said I'm going out Li he said I'm going to sit here until you and you may go through a beating yeah M you may go through a beating but if you're a son the Holy Ghost will finally go you need to go back out there where you used to be or you need to call me back out if you don't mind I'll come out there and help you but he's a gentleman so he'll not we will be free moral agents till the time of the change that's right that's just because remember I read the quote yesterday I wish I had it with me i' read it cuz he said the animal has no free will because he has no soul the reason you're given a soul is to choose right I got I don't have it on here I got it on my papers at home brother rown said the animal has no choice that's right but you no what he was saying was going to heaven he said the animal has no choice of going to heaven let me get it right the animal has no choice of going to heaven or hell what he said right cuz it's just a nature their their flesh will go back down into the Earth and it's gone there's no soul laying somewhere that's got to make a choice but he said in man he put a soul for one thing only and that's to make a choice give you a free will makes you gives you a Godlike quality when he gives you a soul that gives you a Godlike quality you can either choose to or not to everybody okay with that all right right here no matter how strong these are built up this is built up if he's got a weak link there's where she breaks and it's no stronger than that weakest link now if you possess you say you got this this this you don't have this there's where she breaks if you got this and haven't got that she'll break right there point to the Chart you get this and haven't got that it'll break this and haven't got that it'll break this and haven't got that it'll break and if you ain't can't have this without having this now here he's summing this all up he's summing he's making a summation so when you surrender your compl being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues then you're a living Tabernacle then people look at you and say that's a man full of virtue knowledge Temperance patience God brother kindness full of the love of the Holy Ghost see there he is walking around what is it a stature that unbelievers can look at and say there is a Christian there is a man or woman who knows what they're talking about you never see a Kinder sweeter Godly a person you're Seal Seal shows on both sides whether you're going or coming you see what he's saying seal shows forward seal shows back so it's you're coming and you're going and in other words that means if you come into a building and you talk to a group of people and when you walk off they say man that guy ain't no Christian yeah see that's your seal showing on the backside that you're not you may put the front that you are but the you know the opinion of it is no I don't think so a seal shows on both sides whether you're going or coming you see the seal just the same there you are see when a man or woman possesses this then the Capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost so it's the Holy Ghost here and it's the Holy Ghost here and the Holy Ghost here and the Holy Ghost here same Holy Ghost and I really enjoyed what that brother said he said I can put justification sanctification baptism holy ghost in the pyramid I've never in my life heard that except from this church never have I heard that that he could put justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost Inside the pyramid not down here but inside this pyramid and I said brother you're exactly correct so I'm glad that the the Lord is dealing with people that has a good heart that brother I believe got a real good heart then the word coming from him here manifest itself through each of these things beings see and makes this complete being a tabernacle of the Living God a walking living example of Christianity what Christ was these people are cuz his life is in here they are in Christ and their life is dead and hid in Christ through God and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost 1 Corinthians 12 see you reckon yourself dead then you're born of Faith see there they starts you you reckon yourself dead then you're born of faith not a here you're born of Faith so he puts it in the right place see that then virtue and these other things is added if any people would just read the book that thinks you get the Holy Ghost up here he never explains that you get the Holy Ghost up here right you get the Holy Ghost at Faith all right then virtue and these other things is added to you till you're a perfect living image of God that wonderful congregation says amen and then God through that has brought us seven Church ages to show the seven steps that he brought building his individual Into His Image he's built a complete Church in His image at the resurrection this complete body will be raised up to live with him forever because it's a bride so that cuts in every age every age that come and there's more required remember remember what Paul said in Hebrews 11 he he reads Hebrews 11 like what dad's been reading the whole thing all the way down through through here but watch him he gets to the do that what paragraph Was I on right there he reads Hebrews 11 but he some his summation is in paragraph 366 just like he see he said here brother refers to the drawing good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church I believe he's pointing right here has to come to Perfection that's us right the loudest we're the only one that's alive that's right all right this church has to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and there under Souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its Perfection that when Christ does come and this church you see is coming smaller in the minority refers to the Chart board I think he's referring to this look a lot of people in the first St coming down down down down down all the way to the razor's Edge it's a whole lot sharper than that but just like to write that cross there see cuz in the original drawing there's a cross right here there's a cross right on top of that pyramid I wish I could find that I know Daddy's got one somewhere I'll see if I can find the thing it's a whole lot sharper than that but just like to write that cross there see it comes up to the needle point till the church in the minority has got to get into a place until it's the same kind of a Ministry that this left because when this because when this headstone comes back we're going to stop right there cuz we'll cover the other in just a minute I mean next Sunday okay but this church we we actually if you're born again remember we're already raptured out of that church out of the laan church age right right right we're not in any the bride is not in any age but we get the characteristics of that age right everybody in the age got a characteristic of the age we still have that same characteristic to the L and age but we have to be called up into this is a bride age but we got to be called up into here where it's real thin where only a certain group of people can come to but we'll stop just a minute on that and we'll take it up next Sunday we're done Lord bless you Lord bless you Lord bless you
