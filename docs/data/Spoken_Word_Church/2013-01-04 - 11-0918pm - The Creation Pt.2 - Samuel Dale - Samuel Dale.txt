we'll go for 1 26 and 27 and then we'll read from genesis 2 7. now remember the lord willing on the 2nd of october brother keith reed will be here preaching for us for the weekend now to the children especially we've got you some new basketball goals and got some new basketballs down there so we're asking you to do for us you know and help us now i know uh kids that the bigger ones they want to play and bounce on the asphalt you know and it does work better i know that but i'm sorry but we designated and and and richard and terence and zach and all just a whole bunch got down there and fixed the goal where the the little kids could play so that's that one on the asphalt now at the end there is made for the little bitty kids you know the little little bitty girls and little boys that you know that can get out there and play so now please kids go on down to yours and play and you know uh do the best you can down there and have some shooting goals and things you know but don't be up trying to be with the little kids we're trying to make it as safe as possible but we want the little kids to have a good time too because you know they've been kind of pushed out we had the big goals and couldn't do it now we've got it fixed where we can do that and we're in the process of trying to buy some new swing sets and things of that order and we just ask you to help us you know to do and if we come out and we put a little poster sign up on there and says no child under a certain age swings on this we'll please abide by kids because we're we're going to spend a lot of money it's going to cost up and weigh into the thousands of dollars to buy two different swing sets one for the little kids and one for the bigger kids to swing on so you know we don't want to tire up the little kids things and i know some of you get out there and and want to play on the monkey bars and walk the top well um parents if i was you i'd instruct my kids not to try to walk on top of them beans up there you know because they're small and they can get hurt so uh you know just uh adults instruct and then when we do get that set up we will probably try to like in you know appoint a person to stay out there and direct and make sure that everything goes good you know with the kids because we want you to play we just don't want you get hurt so don't get up on the top of those bars and walk out across there that you know i know your kids and i like to play tarzan when i was a kid too we swung out the trees and you know and all like that but brother ray tried it yesterday stepping out of the van with the bus and wound up laying on the ground but i didn't hear him yelling like tarzan we thank god that he was with him because he did slip and fall and just flat on his back right there and we got some scratches out of it but he he's still all right we thank god for that we didn't want nobody to get hurt amen but just remember that kids okay genesis 1 26 and 27 we'll try to pick up the point and move on then we'll go to genesis 2 7. heavenly father we thank you for your loving your grace and to us we thank you that you are god and you change not and that way we can depend upon what you say and we thank you and we ask you to just help us help us to realize realization lord to be able to be your children to be your offspring and what you'd have for us to be here upon earth we love you and we thank you bless the little ride around the world lord remember sister faith our brother richards we forgot this morning but we you know you remember and sister faye was real sick and in the hospital so we ask you to reach down and touch her and just bless each one we love you and we thank you have your way now in jesus name amen so we go to genesis 1 26 and 27 and then we'll go to 2-7 because we're trying to tie together the the point of what we've been what we're talking about this morning right and god said let us make man in our image after a likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the iron over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created in him male and female created he them now we go over genesis 2 7 and the lord god form man out man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils breath of life and man became a living soul you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now i hope that we you know had a have an understanding to to you know understand the point of what we're trying to get to this morning of the creation of the spiritual man now the spiritual man 126-27 the prophet we gave this morning was created before the foundation of the world but the natural man of genesis 2 7 he was created on the sixth day all right and doing that then the spiritual man was created before the world the natural man was created and in the creation of lining up one two three four five six seven day okay we know in genesis 2 then that it goes on to about verse 20 to 25 and it speaks about the fact that god put adam to sleep and took a rib and made him a help meet all right that would have been in the sixth day of the creation of man see nothing was created in the seventh day god rested i know that's contrary to the jewish teaching they say that they're seven days creation but i can't find it but then some of the others believe too that more was created but that's all right that's their business now what i want you to see today is one thing all right now he was made a spiritual man before the foundation of the world and so i was trying to explain about the word creation and to get you to see that when we look at something and we talk about creation our human mind locks on to the point of of like something that was not in existence and then it comes into existence and we we try to make some kind of a certain beginning of things instead of making it to where that we can can uh stay with it in the correct order the word creation doesn't always signify something that's coming into being that as i said that didn't exist it's just a way of stating what you know what it is it's a creation right it means that it was maybe not in that form before but then it became into a form to be able to be seen and we covered where the prophet of god said that god's first creation was himself and then out of that came the logos the another creation but that's not another creation like a different creation it's the same creation in another form another way of doing to where he can reveal himself like i said about the the the fish you know jesus didn't they didn't walk up to him and hand him the fish and the loaves and he said well go set that down over there i'll just do it from here no he took that and he kept from that of the original creation because that way then you can tie all together all right now so as we see them we come to the point of the natural creation of man and that natural creation was brought into being is looking even like the animals but i hope you was listening this morning that god is a person he's real right he has a body he has a place he lives he has a house to live in the prophet of god said all right then in all of that as i tried to explain in the previous messages we look at things here and we tap it on the pulpit of those maybe on tape or something that we think this wood this is oak wood and it's really you know extremely hard and and all because one of the hardest of our woods here in this part of the country uh maybe the hickory a little harder but it's firm and solid and all but you know that's not really the hard that's not real the world above us is what's real the dimensions above us is more real than we are and if we would look at that and stay with that point then we could see that you know god is real as we keep going up and we would we would find a play somewhere that you know we could find what reality really is or what something is real all right now to look at the man then see brother branham said he took that 126 and 27 man and he said that's the catch that where people don't understand he said they don't see that there was a spiritual creation in genesis 1 and then a physical creation in genesis 2. all right so then he took the man of genesis 1 put him into the physical body of genesis 2 but when he put him in there he put him in a special way because he he put him there as one body there was only one body standing there any place within him the theophany the eternal life of god came into adam well brother branham you can go back to those questions and answers in genesis i ask you to do and you'll see in dark you know i'm trying to cut down instead of bringing so much to you and you know but brother brown said he was in adam and that's theophany well now he said her natural being now listen her natural being has elements would be called a by-product right right but he said in her spiritual condition she was not in my brother right right now so follow that line with me now and he said a true husband and wife becomes one in god he said their hearts beat as one they become one in their thinking and they're doing and he said as they do that then truly they're coming back to look like and it was there that adam and eve in the garden standing there in a beautiful condition before sin entered would be a type of christ in the church and so is a husband and wife truly you know a husband and wife they become one together and then their hearts speed is one then why wouldn't you believe that he could say that he was in adam in theophany and then separated why wouldn't we accept that as being a truth because what i've tried to get you to see is that genesis 1 26 is just one person yeah right right that's not a lot of people but ron said that's where he made man not amen you know like he made man all right so then when you come forth in genesis 2 and you put that into a body you see him standing there and what we're looking at a lot of times our mind will lock on a point that we'll only see adam as uh you know that say well it took out the feminist part you know and put it into a body called eve which their name wasn't eve at that time i like what brother stephen wilson said the other day he said when you get down do you call her eve she'd become a byproduct that's when she really messed up because her name wasn't even her name was adam when she developed the name king richie scripture when the name came of eve that meant the mother of all living right theirs were something messed up by that time it was getting all confused but see and i'm not i know the quotes of brother branham and i i love to read and see what he has to say and he said we have taken the woman and made her our god but said remember eve was made for adam right now that's right not adam now i know the women don't like those terminologies but this church should realize by now what brother dale has tried to preach over 40 years to you amen that i am not what is the word i don't i don't i can't finish what's what's that word showing his stick or whatever it is i don't know i'm not the kind that pushes women down all right never what y'all put the words to it i don't have enough education i don't put the women down but i don't push the woman up okay okay so then you ought to realize that we're in a position to where we hold it correct that brother adams would say that on one side she is a symbolic symbol of all things dirty unholy garbage cans and we call her sex deposits you know disposal excuse me and uh but he said on the other hand she's the top of everything beautiful he said she's the top of the bride of christ after a while we're going to get down to where brother branham said something that is going to shock you just a little about most people in their ways of talking about a byproduct i said in most people's ways of talking about a bright brother to me i hear preachers preach about women and by product you know i don't like the jokes where he said yeah they buy products they'll buy every product they can get i don't like that that is silly most men are outspenders and more than women and i just you know would you spend theirs on hunting and fishing and stuff like that i've killed about 30 deer in my lifetime and if i calculated how much it cost me per pound i would have about a hundred thousand dollars per pound in every deer that i've killed so i don't think we need to talk about spending and garbage who's spending too much or what you know i think we ought to just settle down be human forget it and that's what i try to be i don't try to build up i don't try to turn down i try to just state and try to state all that brother branham had to say right but how would you write a statement like this boy you cut it off out there on me on the internet you good because you make me say something bad but how would you like it if brother brown called the bride the bride a byproduct so stay with me paul harvey we get to get to page two but we're not gonna get there right now all right just to make that the word you know you better search out what you're talking about instead of trying to do because what i think most preachers are talking about when they called a woman to byproduct they're talking about them as porterhouse steaks and maybe they might give the woman the right to be uh hamburger and and my wife is very choicey about it and she she doesn't like to buy this regular hamburger meat all right she gets to what is the ground ground brown round as we call it she likes to get that for the hamburger meat all right now i remember when we were so poor that we ate the hamburger meat and what was it used to put in it uh no what are you used to stirring the hamburger meat years ago um well no not the heifers that's later this is on down i'm talking about welding back when i'm dipping red in it we used to put bread but it's not called bread it was something else oatmeal okay used to put oatmeal some of you ain't old enough to know that we ate oatmeal hamburgers all right but it went down and it took care of a lot of things down in the body and we lived and i didn't know what a steak was until i got married i told you i thought when my wife cooked the first chicken she cooked the breast and asked her what in the world the thing was and all i was used to was the neck and the wings you know what we didn't get that when we was kids the preacher got the chicken all right make sure you don't go to sleep but listen see that's what i think people do you see the mail showing us pigs as we're calling a lot of times they want to down everybody why truth is truth your sisters have a place you have the right to prophet said and we'll get to it in a little bit that was where she was made she has a right to say yes or no and you don't blame nobody else don't blame nobody for how you wound up being made in your body you blame yourself for what you are that's right and then you do something about it it's almost to the point that it's just about like that women can't even be saved and i've even heard preachers preach that women shall be saved in childbearing and they just stop and i asked this brother one day i said why don't you quote the rest of that verse he said what i quoted the verse i said no you didn't you left off the last part i said you said some woman shall be chilled saved in you left off where it says if she continues in the faith you didn't talk about that if you just talk about her having babies she's going to be saved that's catholic church sister anna you mean it she came from there that's catholic church that's why they don't believe in birth controls right and things like that all right now let's go on get all the natural out but you know that one thing i like i looked for this and i found the part where i'm talking about adam brother adam said god looked down on adam and saw him not by himself he said he saw him lonely you know what because he was in heaven but there is a quote that runs close similar to it that he said because god at one time was lonely you know god had attributes in him to be a savior a healer deliverer etc you know father all of that and you know he wanted them displayed that's why he was lonely all right but he said adam was lonely because he had nobody he could look at the animals he could see them the male and the female he could see all of the things but nobody for him so god put him to sleep and made him help me it says now a lot of people read that and they still ain't getting it right it doesn't say help mate you make it don't say that read your bible it says help meet m-e-e-t two men can be mates two women can be mates but a wife is really a part of a man that's the way they ought to consider it and that's why don't ever ask me to do a wedding to work that you want to keep your mighty name right i'll tell you up front i ain't going to do it because that's what we took totally derogatory to the bible to say i'm going to keep my maiden name no we'll get into a few things in a minute maybe about a by-product but that's what i said i see most people talk about byproducts and just like and they preach it that she's just a garbage can well why don't they ever get to the point that she's the bride of christ why don't they ever get to the point of realizing they are the bride of christ you know that brothers no matter what you think about your masculinity in the body of christ we are feminist because we're body of christ he's the man we're the the wife that goes beyond your natural comprehension man but now get what i'm saying the spiritual man first genesis 1 26 made in the image of god because that was god the genesis 2 man was the man that was put in the garden adam to start that part of it and i'm going to try to go through a certain way this evening and then i'll drop back to pick up the whole thing of mankind and maybe wednesday but see when he put him in in flesh even though and that was what made him lonely what made him lonely was the in flesh inside of him was something else now i know two ways brother random does it and i'll try to give you both of them he covers it the word that it looked like in a scale going across some quotes that god didn't think enough of her to put her in the first creation does he say she's not an original and you can take that and you can run a long line of things that she was not in the original and then not being in the original then she would have been a byproduct but most people don't look up byproduct anyway they know all about it they're already educated spiritually they know all about it but your look up by product it means something of equal value right or even greater yeah brother ain't greater i didn't say that but there's one thing about it your sisters has got something that you can type the bride of christ you can type the bride of christ keep yourself unto your husband girls don't throw it out to everybody else because if they do i'm just blunt to say it you belong to everybody else and that's the same thing with boys keep yourself into the world today when you get married you won't have the problems life you know well i have trouble doing it you ain't got such a trouble as you will have if you go do it wrong all right but now think on it just trying to get something to you we know that eve was not made like the other animals but all the other animals was made in an original creation right but yet brother adam gets on to the other side of what i was saying there that you can bring her out it's you know god didn't even think enough in her to make her like a dog he just made a dog female didn't like that much as a woman well that's not exactly i don't believe the way to go he thought so much of the one we call eve until he never took a lump of clay to make her out of it you took her from adam you don't hear it that way do you no don't want to down see everybody but he thought so much until he didn't go to that he put adam to sleep when adam was lonely why didn't he just take a lot of clay just creating a wife because see she wouldn't have been part of adam and in no way could you have a type out of that because a male and a female animal is not a type of christ in the church we came out of the side of of jesus christ the same as eve came out of adam we had to come out of christ so as i said you can type it in every which way you want it but yet take the real time what was different about eve what was odd and different about her she was created perfect so that's what most people think you know they want to their little thoughts adam is perfect but she just didn't quite make it where do you get that from where did god get any imperfection to create the imperfect all i want to know where did god get anything to bring anything he creates nothing that's not perfect now there's different between the word perfect and eternal all right i didn't say eternal i said perfect he created adam perfect he created me perfect right if you're going to do anything with bringing and talk about byproducts bring it in to break more on over as stephen said when she gets that name and bringing her into the you know the things don't do it in the original because you didn't have a name that's why sisters you lose your name when you get married right that's why we lost our name when we married christ we become christians miss jesus see in that way you can keep it in the perfect order what about her being created co-equal you don't hear these quoted by the byproduct people okay how about being co-equal bring it up my brother anderson trying to remember who's pulling the cords today look what he's right around says on marriage and divorce 1965 2 21 the morning service number one on your notes paragraph 102. look what he says notice why did she do such a thing being in that high order she was right with man co-equal with him we all know that she lost her co-equalness with man when she sinned and then god put her under the rulership notice the reason she had done these things and the way she was doing was what she's not in god's original creation all right now there's a quoting here somewhere where brother brown said that when he created adam he said and see we on the count one day he said it could have been years and years and years and years before eve came into being right but see she was co-equal now for my understanding of co-equal it'd be kind of hard to tack on the word byproduct there as our understanding of my product are you listening now take that quote from the prophet of co-equal and slap a by-product on top of it and see what what what can you do now the reason she's a byproduct is that he did not take another lump of clay and make her out of it that's the reason she's a byproduct he took a part of adam a product and took a part of it and made a byproduct and she was perfect beautiful everything wonderful no problem all right i told him i gave him a couple we don't have to jump on i called him to throw in quote so okay brother anderson throw in the quote where you got it on corinthians book of correction top of the page is the one i gave you with no number on it 1957 414 paragraph e49 so let's see hey man they get good in there you had it it just disappeared you know all right they they play with things back there a little you know because we're getting used to all this stuff but look read this one very carefully at the beginning they were one god when he made man he made him a dual person both male and female he separated him in flesh and put him here on earth and flesh and the female part was still in spirit look friends god was so careful oh how this don't let it leave you god never got a handful of dust and made it eve she'd have been a different creation and she's not a creation she's a by-product huh i don't degrade that he's explaining it all right be a difference he's not a he's not a creation she's a by-product and god goes over in the heart of adam his right hand right out from under his heart and takes a rib and makes a wife and the very part of adam's spirit was in the woman and they too are one soul body spirit now you argue with brother around you're going to argue with me because i'm going to argue me i'm going to read he said they were one body soul body and spirit okay don't look too much like a bad product looks like part of adam right so they're one they're a perfect oneness a real woman and a real husband a real wife they are one together what is it type of christ from out of his bosom not a by-product now watch what you say not a methodist now what's he saying he's making a by-product they're an organization right come on read it or a badness or a pentecostal hatch up no sir but out of his own heart he took the sweetheart that's as pure and loyal and she can be she's a as loyal as a lily then he goes to solomon while you're there brother anderson just drop them down to the spoken words original seed and let's get one beautiful look 1962 318 paragraph 51 look what your prophet had to say now he gave him a bribe atop the second atom he gave the first atom of bride she failed he gave the second adam christ a bride she failed that's exactly why she's not an original okay she's a by-product now we're going to get down to where you're gonna have to think in a little while to what really was the fall and why your prophet would make these statements he said the bride fell no no brother brad can't fall well now you talk to your prophet he said the bride failed on that other one he called the byproduct to measure just a baptist etc now what's he talking about he's talking about that they could not come back to originality no denomination can come back to originality we've got to come back to the seed in christ so what's he saying here look the bride today is a by-product oh brother now now he read she she calls herself the bride you say oh he can talk about the denominations until you and i come back to the original seed we are a byproduct a denomination now swallow that and pray no well bless god we ain't a denomination what's the difference what is a denomination well a denomination is a group of people got together attacking well we've got two souls seventh under virtue perusia solomon river jordan i'm still stamping and i don't know how many stamps they can stamp that's why i said it i'm in it until the bride of christ comes back to the original seed go to masterpiece god use them denominations go to masterpiece sometime and read it and notice where he stops with mary as a representative of azusa street pentecost because the word was in mary only to the ability to give birth he said mary was not the seed i'd ask you to get that book and read over and over and over said mary was not the seed said the seed was in mary she gave birth to it right we must give birth to the word right then we won't be a byproduct until we give birth to it we are a byproduct that's right because we're an organization right bless god i don't like it i'll turn you off goodbye come on all right when you say around here you'll find out we believe strong in what we believe come and show me where i'm wrong but you better bring your computer and brother brandon with you i'm not going to argue with you on nothing else we're going to see what he had to say about it see what the bible has to say about it but we said but brother daley was just a by-product all right your signification is what upon the basis of what we just brought what is a byproduct a byproduct simply means something taken from the original to make another product all right now when we get on down see then you see that as sin enters the picture surely he becomes a hybrid but now tell me how eve is a hybrid god made her did he make her a hybrid come on you better say no you didn't make her a hybrid right you made her right she became a hybrid because she accepted the wrong seed then really she became a high breeder there was nothing wrong with these right she wasn't made some vulgar form you know what her problem was she was made beautiful and she couldn't handle it she couldn't handle it no she was made beautiful she was co-equal got other quotes if you'd like them there was only one covenant when adam and eve was coequal there was only one covenant when he sinned god made another covenant put it up right let's go ahead pull up um 194 okay then we'll go through that number 95. and notice after the beginning after the beginning after time began back in that was eternity is over notice after that fall was made by eve after the fall there was no need to there was need to be another covenant now this is going to stumble you and he said i'll give you scripture god at the beginning made one of a kind but now after the fall right they didn't say he made it wrong after the fall we're going beyond the covenant was co-equal but now after the fall there is another covenant made but she was no longer ruler with him each must have a separate covenant what made the two covenants come into being because of her fault because of what happened god never made two covenants in the beginning when he was in adam there was no need of two covenants you agree when eve was taken from adam and placed in a rightful position there was no need of two covenants she was coequal but when she done what she done she became to a position no longer co-equal now listen come on church this is the covenants that goes down to the polygamies et cetera et cetera et cetera i don't have time to explain it this is not talking about that a woman has one way of salvation a man has another there's only one way of salvation that's jesus christ don't get over on the other side with it the two covenants wound up to were that he wound up with more than one wife which she could never have but one husband that's right he can put her away marriage and divorce but there's no scripture for a woman to ever divorce a man period that's right mine not because that she was a bad egg but because she let the egg go bad two covenants look at the next one number three right record 198 marriage and divorce you talking about the beginning it wasn't so we got another covenant now it's another covenant now there's a there is a covenant for the product all right and the byproduct see now she's developed the wrong thing now she is a byproduct that is in bad shape a covenant for the product the male the covenant for the right product the female i didn't write the book but i do believe in the straightness of the book you keep it right now requiring another covenant see adam and eve was co-equal one man one woman now the woman sinned and what does she do that throwed them all to death and god had to make a covenant by that another covenant here it is right here in genesis 3 16. he made another covenant all right i'll put enmity between thy seed and seed of the woman now by product what made the byproduct to be in our word or terminologies of what we look at it as a bad thing with what the by-product done will you go along with me i said all of that to say one statement will you go along with the statement that she done the wrong not that she was made wrong not that she was forced into a situation that she could not uh resist but she was the one that done the wrong now we get onto the basis of looking at it as something that's not right but still now get the whole point i know what brother branham says and i just quotes there i'll give them to you if you want them that she was made to where she could fall now what's he talking about he said she was made so she could fall now did god make her wrong that's my point if you believe that then there's no need to continue under the rest of the story if you believe god made her wrong she was made perfect she started from beauty as number one and she began to reason no female animal can reason you agree female animals dog cats whatever they don't reason she was made with the ability to reason you know there's nothing wrong with reasoning you know the bible says come let us reason together though your sins will be scarlet there'll be white us all right there's nothing wrong with reasoning if it's in the right way reasoning is what helps us in life and doings and doing better and better jobs and you know and reasoning upon the word of god right no blessed god i don't reason brother dale i just take what it says well then i'm sorry this you trying to convince me or yourself but what way was she made see lucifer was made perfect and on one of those quotes if you looked them down a little bit while ago is underlying lucifer at one time was co-equal with god except for the fact he couldn't create what did lucifer fall from reasoning beauty knowledge wisdoms wanting to know more wanting to be looked up to right what did he kill leave in the garden you be his god well you know what that was what she's supposed to be right you know if we believe that he was in adam and if we believe rhetoric said that she was in him in theophany right you may not agree with this that's all right show me where i'm wrong adam had eternal life what did he have right see now you want to drop down and say now she is created a little bit different you know she didn't get exactly all of it so that made her where she could uh now brother branham didn't say that right that's your thoughts sister asked me yesterday said about the mormons and the way they believe in them they said where did they get that from i said sitting down thinking amen but satan took the thing to remember the sin in heaven would have to be descent on earth and it would have to return in the end time he was not made a sex pot that is the attribute agreed she wasn't made that she couldn't control herself if you did you got trouble with god making her that way that's right you got trouble with god making her if you don't let him make her in a certain way if he does anything whatsoever to make her wrong in any form then other than what he made adam you got a problem you better remember one thing you say adam was perfect i agree okay but from my understanding of the bible even the beast brought cain adam and eve brought abel well you know then adam had the ability i don't want to get nasty do you follow me yeah he was perfect hey folks don't run down here to all of this stuff i've been asked this you know people say okay don't let me go down to the this is a point go down to the ymca and work out so good but how come in the ymca i think i've been to one i just take everybody else's word okay but there ain't never a 400 pound woman out there showing you how to work weights in her bikini you go in there and man they get them pumping and waste this little girl come back oh look at it man you're strong he goes home dying from pain right get what i'm talking about we look at adam and the beauty and all and it was perfect but you know he did have an act with eve you know that god never beat him to death about doing that you know why he was human amen don't go down to the honky tonks boys think you can testify to them women come on this gets the point of what i'm talking about i'm talking about what's the difference in adam and eve if you make it eve so lustfully sinful in her desires and her doings until she can't control herself why didn't adam say i don't want you no more i'm so holy and pious i can't do that but he did i ain't never heard nobody preach like you i agree with you they've never been nobody with me like i am well i hope it gives you a little understanding to get away from looking down on women and being byproducts you know dog meat you big old steak you know look at me i didn't fall the bible says in adam all die amen he never sold the human race adam sold the human race am i in the bible adam had a right to just throw her away you say top christ okay fine but he had the right to do it and the bible told him not to do it right there's a lot of incidents in the bible where that people would take back but the bible said don't do it you're going to stay in the scripture it's going to be plain but was he made such a way can't you see exactly what happened in heaven lucifer and what started out so simple i want things to be prettier that's right i want it to be beautiful i i kind of think maybe that that i'm a pretty nice guy and it wound up in a battle in heaven had to be cast out went up in sin right what happened in the garden it probably took years and years to explain to for the beast to explain to eve the whole situation and why would brother branham emphasize over and over and say she was wrong and said she still thinks she's right that's right come on did he do it emphasize it she still thinks he's right and she becomes what mess of this baptist presbyterian brandon mouse lula ice okay you know what the exaltation was i tried to explain it the other night and i'm sorry i don't have a way and sometimes i lose my thought and gotta preach like get it back but it's all right what's the problem today people come to a church and they don't know nothing hardly about you know the deeper things of bread around his message would you let them hang around for a few years and first thing you know they begin to get hooked into that real good and you know what they find out they know more than the you pastor the one that taught them well you know my brother daley is i hope you do know more than i do that don't bother me what bothers me is when people unless you get to the big head and they won't listen because that's what happened in heaven that's what happened to eve in the garden she got to knowing more about it than adam and you say but now brother dale what happened in the garden if it was over a period of time before the the things takes place as we call it why didn't adam know all about why didn't adam say he leave that based alone now what took care of it the whole beast and eve when i tried to explain to you the other night satan lucifer tried his best to destroy michael and michael was the thing that stood between him and god to keep him from being killed there in the garden god had to blind adam's eyes right looked like he was seeing what was going on but he didn't see it it was all in god's plan to kind of let everything just kind of run wouldn't it yes to give everybody a choice he gave the devil a choice he took his choice look what he went wrong with it and tell me i want to know i mean i'm honest i'm sorry i just like to know things show me the great thing that that lucifer done in heaven what was the great thing he done to get kicked out come on it's been preached to you but do you even see it now what was the great thing you've he done eat up in his own self pride look at me i'm more beautiful than michael that was my job and he took it away from me just help me and we'll get it back what else you're going to say happened in heaven we done done away with the fact that he was committing adultery running around and all that things were taking place in heaven because he wouldn't die and if it was angels couldn't have done it but they have no ways so when he come to even the garden they started real slow look how beautiful you are don't you know eve that they're withholding from you the very thing you know when she was in adam when god said multiply and replenish the earth agree don't you think that some of that would be retained when she would be put in her own natural being especially if she was part of adam's soul part of his being but we think we get it all figured out when we think that then adam was masculine and feminine we see him on one side and he said oh you're doing this one animal hi animals how you doing i don't think anyway i'm sorry here regardless of what you think was pulled out and put over the other you got to remember there were one that's right two people standing there with bodies right right but one identity her name was adam she don't get the name eve until the fall transmits that's right so the beauty of the things that she had the way she was made now i'm sorry i just talked plain so if you don't like it i'm sorry you don't see too many prostitutes that weigh 450 pounds not blown enough yes i'm sorry you don't see that that's right it's in beauty your sisters have your beauty but your beauty is your husband and why is it you get up and you pretty yourself up and you really smell good and you look good and you dress up just go buy groceries and the hubby comes in and there you are and there it all moves around okay you get the point and it will shock me if i come in one day my wife was standing there with a you know all dolled up and everything and said hi honey i'd say oh wrong house well honest she does dress up for me though i just hope you get the point i'm trying to get to you a simple little instruction what was the difference in adam and eve we don't solve one problem adam had ever ability and produced the ability and it says he killed the human rights he said brother daley never heard nobody talk like him i agree with you but is it the truth yes that's right but eve got in her beauty i know be glad to get them to you lord around said she was made that way he said she was made beautiful how did he know i'd run around but i loved it because i believe him he said there stood adam said he wasn't a great big masculine thing looking like a big city just kind of wasn't a guy problem maybe you know but he said understood if i get it wrong y'all correct what blond-headed blue-eyed beautiful he said i see all these pictures they draw and said makes it look so weird but he said no said she was the prettiest woman and you know what how many quotes you want that was her curse you want tim told you i don't bring everything you think i'd pray a lot but that was her curse the curse of making her beautiful to make her to give her to adam god didn't want to give adam an ugly woman he doesn't want an ugly woman i ain't talking about when you got run over by a truck you can't have it you know what i mean by that that's an old joke among us we're a bunch of we're just ugly but beauty is beauty i look at you girls and i see you i think oh god what if it would be for a world full of people the word that you see the sisters that are really dressed nice and you know not showing yourself to the world why would you want to show yourself to the world why would you want to unveil your body and show it to the world not realizing you're going to pay for commitment adultery but why wouldn't you want to have your beauty to your husband and your husband only see if he would have stayed right look what it would have been lucifer to stay right look what it would have been but eve was made and given a beautiful being of herself and satan says don't you realize that's what you're made for i've preached to you what 40 years and you know what i'm fixing to say what i preach for 40 years satan was trying to tell eve that she was going to bring forth the product that god wanted rob i've always believed that she believed she was going to bring forth what god had said multiply and replenish the earth she was trying to help god just as sarah was trying to help god when she gave hagar to abraham her beauty was her curse she wasn't made as i said to be all lustful you look beautiful she had to be brought into a place and that had to be through her spiritual being in their spiritual beings she began to accept satan's lie right and then things started happening then the beast could say look at the animals they are reproducing that's what you made for but at that time the animals were reproducing look what they're doing they're multiplying replenishing the earth because that's what you're money for brother brown said the mind things she done she mixed her seed she couldn't wait well where's original seed he said the church can't wait you look around this message people and you see that they can't wait they gotta have something tantalizing something going something running some way some new thing now brother brown said the way that the woman was made with one thing and i'll end with he said she was made to be able to receive at any time a male said whereas the animals you look at a line but he's mean and tough but he will not touch that female until she's ready because he knows he's going to have some scars on his he said she was made to work she could receive a mail at any time now i've been not going away i think a lot of times but i was going to say part of it what's wrong with a man and wife being husband and wife and living together now you understand my point everybody know what i'm talking about what's wrong with that nothing so was she made in a bad way but her beauty her desire of knowledge her all kind of things took her to a place that she eventually done the wrong thing no right act with the wrong person as you say she didn't become a hybrid for a high breeder because that's what she done she bred the animal race to the human race and then you can think all you want to of how holy and pious and lovely you are you ain't nothing but a hybrid that's right every human being in the world except jesus christ prophet priest king or who is a hybrid you want those quotes brother branham said i'm a hybrid because you see the byproduct that should have been that brother maloney said actually the word foreign and i don't know this in the greek i'm just quoting him sounds good he said in the greek that really eve was signifying as being a womb of wounds w-o-m-b one you know to reproduce the man that's how close it is she's given to reproduce man her problem was she refused to reproduce an animal in man because we know what happened in the garden you ever noticed then that god didn't curse adam you want the quote god didn't curse he you want the quote he cursed the animal because now the animal must be the sacrifice that's right because he said the animal calls to fall now it must be accepted as a sacrifice so then you started making your sacrifices of animals until jesus came a lot of people don't read enough to know what read around and say it but what about it you sisters you have the most wonderful opportunity in the world hold yourself keep yourself pure why won't you even want to go in and show your body why would you have any desires whatsoever as to anyone else besides your husband and i'll say say that brothers why would you because remember i just got through proving the point that you may not like a lot of people here that won't like it at all but you know adam had a part to do with this thing because he had a choice now let's don't go too far okay because there is doctrines among the people of the message that said adam grabbed eve and planted his seed within her to save her now you brother gary what was that you used to tell me about them when y'all live down on the 10th street you know the hippie movement free love if sex is what kept eve from being destroyed then what's wrong with it no no no come on sex didn't keep me from being destroyed sex was the original and then they'll take julian and tamar and they bring it over and they try to bring out these beautiful things and they show that tamar took you know judah took tamar planted his seed to savor let me quote brother branham i don't see how that adultery can be a predestinated seed quote brother there where does that leave me because i'm not don't worry about it because ain't none of us in this building original season naturally i don't care what you think your family come from what tree you come off of all the human race is a garbage can was run around saying that an illegitimate child he said i don't see how the illegitimate child can go into rapture you see why people want to quote but they don't answer the quote every one of us in this building was born from an adulterous act right oh no no my mom and dad was married well what about grandma grandpa what about grandpa grandpa grandpa grandpa grandpa don't remember the bibles this is bad for one's other that's right what's brother brown saying an illegitimate child is not a predestinated seed because he talked about the seed of natural things because if you get born again you're not illegitimate anymore and if i was bastard born from 40 generations and you could prove my dna went straight back to cain i would still stand here today and say jesus christ has saved me no sex act didn't save me a creation to come into being all right to take my place and pay my price my child going into rapture no but all babies go to heaven so what are you worried about that's right from the time we go into rapture it's only three and a half years maybe you can't believe it three and a half years old so don't worry about it but it's not going in the rapture with you because like i've always told you you have a child today and rapture takes place tomorrow that baby's going with you if mom and daddy are going i believe that because i believe in in jesus christ being a savior a redeemer he come to redeem you and i from those things that we thought were our ideas and that's the main sin that we have is our concept or thoughts of what we believe because mama told me grandma told me grandpa told me he said we're laying in the bible yes it is people are getting just upset with you because you tell them it's not in the bible mom told me what i don't want to call mama liar i just say mama didn't read it right that's right my mama your mama who it was they just didn't read it right because we're down here remember we're here where it can be brought into being now the thing that was in heaven that was unbelief and the thing that happened in the garden now why is it that you see around this message that is turning to beautiful buildings and beautiful congregations sorry not jealous i don't want 700 i'd wear my arm out because you know yourself when i go outside i shake hands with everybody you don't shake hands with me today it'll be your fault you won't hang around long enough if i had 700 i'd shake hands with 700. i know jealousy of all these people we could have that we could have a brand new building but instead of that we try to put it back in for the work of the lord okay i'm tickled but we really work good around here we look at the video sometimes when we see we did that the things here at sure oh yeah we got a little small 700 camera or something maybe i don't know what it was sitting over here and the man sitting on the still haven't operated don't even have automatic controls and we have a small place up here to the to the musicians have to play in harmony because if the film goes up the horn's got to go down they have enough room to breathe i need a lot about beauty around here but you know i love it i love her music i love people because we're trying the same thing we're trying amen trying to get rid of what he let get in her way oh look how y'all look at lulu got all the words ain't nobody look whoever said that where'd you get it i never said we got all the word that's right i hear a preacher come up here and say we've got all the word i'll get up right behind him say will he lie i'm not a problem we don't claim that we just claim to have what god gives us thank god for that a rejoicing time about all of it where do we got me all right all right anybody have any yes have amen decided is is oh i have decided let's see your party oh oh oh oh um me like your desires you leave so today inside so you
