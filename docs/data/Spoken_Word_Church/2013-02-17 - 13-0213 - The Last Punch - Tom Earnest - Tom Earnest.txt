========================================

oh amen foreign me everybody say praise the lord all right let's read our scriptures together if we can in matthew matthew chapter 7 it is good to be in the house of the lord with you tonight damn it good to see you all out on a wednesday night it's coming rainy and and cool and this time last week we had well on thursday last week we were supposed to we were up in canada we got a foot and a half of snow on thursday night so all right let's read our scriptures together matthew chapter seven you're going to know this one very well you could probably look back in your in your years of being in church and have heard it preached on many times verse 24 therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat up on that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that here at these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened into a foolish man which built his house upon the sand the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when jesus said into these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine right now like verse 29 40 taught them as one having authority right and not as the scribes exactly and it wonderful that you can tell the difference between the scribes and him let's just pray father as we look into the word tonight and have a little time around the the word of life that's left here for us we pray you'll say something that'll quicken and happen and encourage and lift up and and let us let us find a way to be a better soldier for the journey that's left out ahead of us lord we're always looking for that thank you for the the faithfulness of the people to see them out here on a on a wednesday night many of them probably work today and the frustrations of work so hard sometimes to roll that off and and enter into the word but we pray you'll help us for this little time together in her name amen amen god bless you may be seated i understand that y'all just began a new tradition around here of having the people stand while the preacher preached i don't know i i heard that i'm just saying actually i i was so intrigued by it i went back and watched today so i did see it i wanted to see how that was done you know i'm just gonna get rid of this but uh yeah it was but you know i'm gonna take up from my brother back then because that is actually the way it was done in jesus christ how many times did he sat down and the people stood up so as our brother dale gets older i expect to see a chair up here for him to sit down so he's just getting ready for the way it's going to be that's right jesus sat in the boat and the people stood on the shores that's all scriptural you did well my brother you did well but see we just get it messed up in our laodicean minds we want to relax most of us want to get on to sleep so we can be rested up for work tomorrow i've been out there i've been out there with you that's right but it is good to be with you i enjoyed hearing our brother that's some very good thoughts there he had a lot of them i will have to give him credit for that we have a lot of good things but i appreciate it getting whatever the lord's going to do through our brothers that's right all right amen we we really just have a a pass through this wednesday night i i always hate to invade a man's pulpit and wins we were just coming by and we had you know who was at our house a couple of weeks ago mostly this trip was payback for that so that i could stay in his house and and agonize him the way he antagonized us for a whole week out there but i was i was tempted to just take a little time to share with y'all how he acts when he gets on the road but i know he won't be able to handle that so we don't want to get into that too much but we did enjoy having brother wade out and he gets to stay at our house and so we appreciate our birthday all y'all all y'all that are here it's good good to be with you of course on wednesday we always want to go quickly because just because you never can get to the end the brothers ask me to handle quotes and i handed them enough for about three or four hours if we just went slow and so we'll get to as much as we can and we live in a funny a very uh unusual time i mean you know here how many would have known a few just what it wasn't monday this week we found out we're getting a new pope yeah he's going to resign on february 28th i don't know what that means i'm not a prophet or the son of a prophet and i know a lot of folks probably tonight in the pulpits they're speculating and postulating and formulating yeah and data layton you know setting some dates it is it is unique that he's resigning on the very 50-year anniversary of the cloud appearing right now right i don't know what that means it's just the way it is sorry you know and the lord will we'll make all that work out we coming up on the 50-year anniversary of the seals being opened and you know it's a it's a funny thing that that here we are 50 years later talking about that and there was people sitting in those meetings that week that the seals were being open and expecting brother when he preached that seventh seal right that it was going to end that day all right and here you and i are 50 years later we're still talking about it right it makes it more wonderful than ever right right because i got a really dried out mouth so y'all just saved me from spitting on these guys if i keep sucking on that thing a little bit it's almost too fancy to use though you know but that's that's good thank you for whoever provided that yeah 50 years later we you know like i said people that were in those meetings brother you've heard the testimonies we thought when he opened that seventh seal it was going to be over that morning all right and here we are still worshiping around i don't care if it's another 50 years i plan on still being there all right i'll be too old then to talk to you all about it but you know i'm not worried about it being 2013 right not worried about it that's right about it you know all the dates we passed and yep right you know i said to a group the other day you know the quietest bunch around right now are the mayans you don't hear much out of them haven't had any mayans stopping you on the stream handing you out a track telling you it's all going to be over in 2012 right i don't know harold camping he's also pretty quiet of course he died so that probably prohibited him picking another day but you know he picked a couple along the way that buses out all around the world and they were they were coming to an end and and then we had the mayans and there was a lot of a lot of people put a lot of stock in that mayan thing the mayan calendar i don't know who could read a mayan calendar anyway y'all ever seen y'all see pictures of it on the internet the internet people probably do a round disc with all these engravings on it and i like that that cartoon that was on there the best they had a mayan calendar there around this and had an oreo cookie over here beside of it yeah right and underneath it it said the mayans tell you that it's all going to be over in 2012 but the oreo cookie says you're okay you know one's about as valuable as the other exactly it was funny but it was quite true and if you looked at them they both looked about the same they both had engravings on them and they both had one of them probably said nabisco and i don't know what the other one said but those guys are quiet now but it uh it doesn't matter how many more come and go hollywood got people excited about 2012 and they made that movie in the earth breaking up and asteroids and meteors and and all of those things going on but we just ain't really too bothered about what day it is enrollment calendar the calendar so goofed up from all the years of adding and subtracting multiplying and dividing we hardly know what the real calendar is anyway i like brother brown's philosophy we need to just live today right glory like tomorrow could be the last amendment right and then whenever it is we're just ready right it's just staying on ready right amen and so tonight we're gonna we're gonna look at a little simple thought coming through on a quick wednesday night like this so we're not gonna get into into too much heavy and and and deep-minded stuff but let's just look at what brother branham said about these verses he in the oncoming storm and i gave the brothers these quotes i don't know if they're in any kind of order that they can can help put them up there but this is in the message of the oncoming storm brother branham has just read these verses and he said this jesus was speaking here of a coming storm which has got to strike every man and every woman that's born in the world there is just no way out of it right man that's a promising wednesday night it's tight topic right the oncoming storm that storm will strike you sometime or another and it depends on what kind of a foundation that you have right whether your house will weather it or not that's right there's been many lives saved because of preparation for storms there's been many of life's lost because of failing to take heed to the warning of storms that's coming we might come back to that in a few minutes but that just sets the tone for what we're going to look at tonight jesus was speaking of a coming storm which has got to strike every man and every woman that's born in the world i believe brothers and sisters that we have the the antidote for that storm here in front of us let me just say that that's the end of the message but that's that's all i'm going to think about throughout it there's a quote i wanted to read to you christ is revealed in his own word and and it was it was very very struck my heart very special in this area and and i trust it'll be a blessing to you this is in 1965. brother branham is beginning his text he says now my text this morning is christ is revealed in his own word now where i come to the conclusion to talk on that on this was because that knowing that what we say we mustn't just say because we're gathered together to just haphazardly speak on anything but it's something that will help stabilize the people right yeah if every preacher would come to the pulpit with that in his heart in mind we'd have a whole lot better services i get to visit a lot of churches i get to sit in a lot of meetings i don't always preach when i go out to service i could have blown in here on wednesday night and sat and listened it would have been it would have been just fine and i do get to hear a lot of different preachers i go on the internet and i try to keep up with not because i'm nosy but that's 50 of it the other 50 percent maybe 60 some nights when i'm feeling really nosy it's 75 percent of it but but i do like to see what brothers are looking at and i don't want to be critical of men of my own profession you know it's like one car salesman criticizing another you're both in the same thing you know i mean you're both doing the same job right and i don't want to be critical of ministry but but my goodness brothers and sisters as long as i listen to some of these men preach and i wonder if they've ever even listened to a tape right or read the books or studied the message right i'm embarrassed for men that i know that have been ministering for years can't just just can't read it off of the page and get the revelations what brother brown was trying to tell them now their argument might be well that's your revelation and this is mine and but you can tell you can tell the difference in a man that that that is not applying himself to the word right right and brother dale and i were talking about it a bit last night you know you sit and you talk to people and and you hear brother branham said and he didn't say that at all it's just what they a lot of times they're repeating what they've heard that he said right and they don't take time to go back into the message themselves and and it is an embarrassment again i don't want to be be critical of people of my own profession but there are some horrible man this may sound awful there's some really bad preachers out there is that is that too cruel i don't know they say they're called but our brother said more last night than that a basket full of them have said in the last six months right yeah right and i i'm not interested to pinpoint them you'll run across them soon or another and that's why or hopefully you won't hopefully that won't be the case right but this is what brother branham says we don't want to gather back to that quote we don't want to gather just because we're gathered and just haphazardly speak on anything right but we want to say something that will help stabilize the people that's what a lot of them don't have in their heart they come in with a doctrine or they come in with a a personal little revelation and they want to say something that doesn't stabilize the people but messes their minds up right right where's the motivation behind that from right that's right oh my he says they need to stabilize the people because we're going to pass through dangerous treacherous waters we're already sailing through them right and sometimes and this is an honest confession from brother branham and sometimes i guess it's with you like it is with me it seems like so much of it is such a scary yeah it's such a scary that's what that's what he's saying it's just such a scary right time he goes on have they got that quote up are you finding that one back there because i wanted you to read this one with me there we go paragraph 18 there i was just talking to a young minister and his wife in the room just a few moments ago and both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world rest of the human beings on earth and i said remember satan's got a punch coming at you i don't care who you are he's got a right and this is we don't appreciate this but if we was born with it right we was born with satan's right on us is that right i mean he was right he was our first he was first in line right remember satan's got a punch coming at you don't care who you are he's got a right for that one punch which should you rather be that punch be blind or being arthritic sitting in a chair or be nervous see he's got somewhere he can punch you right he's got a right to that open place now that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time and to see this nervous age that we're living in that's right amen i think brother branham is looking at the body as a whole the group as a whole and he's saying if there's one spot that he hits the most of us at it's nerves every one of us has got him if you ain't got no nerves you've got them maybe it just hasn't been hit in the right spot yet but we're all nervous that's right we were talking about a little bit in our fellowship last night how many prayer lines you would listen to brother branham as the women you know as they reach that time of life and they would they would come at the up in the prayer line thinking something was wrong with them and you go back and listen to those cases and and the sister would come and and he'd say oh he brother i remember very clearly he said oh sister he says he said that's just he said that's just that's just human nature that's just you going through the change of life he said if i ask half of the women out here that's your age they can all raise their hand and say they got the same thing he says that nervousness is right he's just born in it now i know it affects some women worse than others and easier than others and i've heard women believe me these are conversations we all run from right but i know the sisters get together they compare notes we don't care about that that's y'all's information we are okay all right brother wants in on that i i don't understand but i know if you're young you sisters haven't reached there yet ask some of the older ones they have lots of notes taken for you along the way i remember this and i remember that and brother branham wasn't making little of that he was just recognizing it's a human condition that's a human condition and they're thinking something is bad wrong with them and it's just a human condition right and the lord has helped for that there certainly we understand there's severe cases and mild cases and and all of those things but but it's just he said maybe it's with you like it is with me we're just in a nervous time right just a nervous time and satan's got a punch come at you would you rather be something else right that's right come on bro you see his question that's what he's asking you would you rather be blindness would you rather be you're sitting there through to get a chair or just be nervous what you're gonna take i'll take the nerves and i'll take the grace that comes right for a nervous condition but don't you see here's what brother branham is telling us when we look into the word there is help from the word for this era there is help from the word if a minister comes to the pulpit with the right heart with the right attitude not just haphazardly speaking on anything but he wants to find something that'll stabilize the people right sure you know i wish there was a magic wand or a magic sermon that i know brother dale probably would like to have one that he could just wave over the congregation and you are stabilized forever how many know stabilization is a continuing process because it's an oncoming storm it's waves crashing into it and you may be able to better one and then tomorrow there's a different one but brother branham looks at these quotes he begins to look at this and he recognizes that somewhere in our lives there's a big punch coming he's got one how many believe that i don't know if you can stop and look back in your life and say i remember when that one came right if you've lived through it i wouldn't get too comfortable because right right because knowing the walls of the enemy right yeah he will try to duplicate it so you can the good thing is after you come through it you know how to fight the battle yeah and the lord keeps giving us strength that's right but that's what he says remember satan's got a punch a punch i just call this message the last punch the last punch here's another quote that i wanted to add to this and you'll see where our thought is coming from it's in the unwelcome christ back in 1955 brother branham is is actually praying before he gets in into the message there our brothers can find that one forces in 1955 starting right there we're thankful this morning lord that you put with us the eye of the eagle the holy spirit that looks far off and sees the great time coming when jesus shall come all troubles will be over you see brother respect i'm grateful that you've given us an eye of an eagle that can look for out there right when all troubles will be over right all sickness will end all sorrows and death will flee away we're happy for this hobby wouldn't be happy for that alrighty man aren't you looking forward to that like brother lord we are grateful that you're letting us see that right we're happy for this and to have the opportunity living in this great marvelous day now preaching the gospel and knowing this look as he goes on he's praying now knowing this that satan is making his last punch at the church he will never be able to do it after this age she will be safely under the wings of her lover after this time and we realize that he's impersonating in the way of religion he's doing all kinds of the things and the bible said he'd be like a roaring lion devoured what he would he'd be so shrewd and cunning that he would deceive the very elect if possible amen and he puts it in brackets and brackets there if possible what does that mean it's impossible right it's not possible that the elect will be deceived but oh lord thou art the protection of those who flee to that bosom for a refuge and here we come in jesus name receive us lord amen he says i'm grateful we're thankful lord that you've given us an eye that when the storms of life are raging we can look over there and guess what you got right standing by me when the when our friends of me have left us and our foes have y'all sing that song here stand on me what a wonderful song right when the storms of life are raging stand by me stand by me over and over and repeat that this is what our prophet is telling us we're glad that you've given us a vision a vision beyond the the mess that's going on today beyond the troubles that we have today you know we when we sit together as brothers and we were sitting just having some fellowship last night with brother wade and we and and it's human nature we began to pile up all the scarecrows along the way right oh my goodness we had a big pile in just a very short time oh my god that's even hard for me to say because there was men broken on that pile of scarecrows they were my friends there's brothers piled up in that pile of scarecrows that just needs to be burned and forgotten about right that are shipwrecked some of them are dead and gone some of them are still living coming out with doctrines that lead them into filth and defilement right and yet and yet somehow looking at that pile of scarecrows and brotherhood so that's what the devil will always try to get you to do he'll try to get you to look at some shipwreck along the way and say look they shipwrecked what hope do you have right but i have hope and that's the only thing we're talking about tonight oh yeah we can make a pile don't glory in the in the beat down that you got once upon your life let me just say that i've had them i've worked with a man for seven or eight years as his associate here he told me in the very end as i was on my way out the door he said the only mistake you ever made was thinking that i needed you here oh man i wish you'd told me that seven years ago when sure don't let the disappointments i know a lot of brothers friends of mine when you get with them all they want to talk about is how badly they were abused in some other church one time or another yeah leaving those things that are behind when you press forward right don't hang on to those shipwrecks a long way amen don't revel and rejoice over and over even though you say it's it's it's just it's not but it is it's there's some value that you're seeing and knowing that you were once abused and scarred and and mistreated and called names given up forgetting those things we've all got them we've all had pastors that didn't do us right right we've all had churches that didn't do us right yeah oh it's it's easy but don't let that hinder you don't let that bother you now amen satan is making his last punch at the church if we could if we could throw our shoulders back tonight when we're done and say we've got something to rejoice about this is the last group that right that's what brother brown said satan is making his last punches to the church he'll never be able to do it after this age right right don't you see what a wonderful age god let us live all right that's right we're taking the last hits and you know why he's not gonna have anybody else to hit again is because we're going to overcome it and walk out and be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye amen he will be defeated by what our change right amen satan will be defeated by a group of people that brother branham said as she nears him she will be so much like him right she'll be in his very image glory that's the defeat of the enemies what's what is it over in the millennium when he he had what did brother graham say the reason he can't cause any trouble anymore right he has nobody to work on all right we're getting there brothers and sisters we got there yet we got there yet yeah right you know i can kick brother wade hard enough in the shins he's finally going to get mad at me but that won't be he only takes one lick he says see it can happen we're in a glorious time amen i believe brothers and sisters when this bride overcomes when that when when the scripture is finally fulfilled we which are alive and remain will not prevent or hinder them that you are asleep amen but we'll all be we'll be changed in a moment in the trackling overnight don't you realize satan is defeated amen uh us waving goodbye is his last defeat because there's nobody left to work on it amen that's why brother brown says satan is making his last punch at the church he'll never be able to do it after this age that's why we say don't don't worry about writing a book of acts behind this church why because there ain't going to be nobody there to read it this is it we're us for us right and i know what you're sitting back at this while ago you said 50 years ago we thought it was us i don't care if it's not me brother branham talked enough about enoch and he said he said i may not have faith to go like him but somebody will just don't let me get in their way don't let me hand her down right now because somebody it becometh us to fulfill all right it becometh us to fulfill this word and be that elect lady yes that is going to be changed that's right oh man we're taking the last hit that's the last bullets coming this way right come on he's a bluff anyway when that horse how much damage can a guy do with a boat right he forgot and left his arrows at home right come on you i don't boat huh but you guys at the bow hunt i mean you ever get with just a boat yeah yeah come on no none right because why he's got no weapon right right that's why the scripture says no weapon that he forms against the ship i was reading some old football player the one the super bowl was using that as his quote man leave that alone yeah like who's impressed by that yeah he's talking about football we're talking about warfare hey man all right i don't mean to get i did get disgusted at that no weapon for him against this shall prosper yeah he's talking about another football team that's not why that scripture is right that's nuts for us that's right satan is making his last punch at the church he'll never be able to do it after this age this is the last punch over in revelations 12 just quickly look at that it's worth reading i want you to read read that that revelation you know this verse very well it's an end time verse talking about war in heaven verse chapter 12 verse 7 there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevail not neither was their place found anymore in heaven that the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying and heaven now has come salvation and strength in the kingdom of our god in the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused him before our god they and they overcame him they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony they love not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice ye heavens and you that dwell in them what are the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath having great wrath because he knoweth what that he had about a short time exactly come on there's a great wrath time going on he's got his last punch coming at us right and the book of revelation sums it up as great wrath all right you know why he's so angry because he ain't got much time left right right there and because there's somebody here that can take that blow there's somebody on the scene that can take that gift that can take that punch brothers and sisters some of them are sitting in this building tonight that elect lady that can take that kind of a blog that can take that time of great wrath right amen i'm not fall all right she's sitting here tonight man that's why you've been called to this word it's not because we're of anything in ourselves it's because this word has fortified us yes it's because of this foreign but oh it's a nervous age it's a weak age it amazes me sometimes what what trips people up do you ever you get amazed you hear people falling away because of some little minor insignificant don't amount to it hillary beans nothing right now come on brothers and sisters amen well i just can't go down to that church no more because and it's the weakest right right oh my goodness the weakest reason i can't go because of that well i'm glad it wasn't something big yeah yeah right something big you just went out and hung yourself right i can't go because of nothing right people are finding reasons amen it's that last is that it's part of that last punch coming at the truth right amen because those that can be shaken they will be those that can will but those that cannot cannot everybody would deceive the very elect but you know what he cannot deceive the very like because it's not possible right right if it was possible he would but it is not possible having great wrath it all bleeds on into the squeeze i don't know what y'all believe about the squeeze come on man you know i know i preached here not long ago in the church the guy got up behind me the next week i hurt him myself and i got that bad habit of going back and listening to what people thought of me i shouldn't have cared i should have just preached the word and when i i got one or two complex not near as many as brother wade but i've got a couple you know i got a cup and i want sure enough i know brother tom said that about a squeeze and pressure and persecution but i just want you to know i've already had a mental squeeze i agree with that my brain is squeezed out as well sure but i i can't take this batch of quotes right right and make it a mental squeeze i can't take this you know i'm sitting in brother wade's chair there this afternoon and i looked over there and there was a a brochure about alaska vacations i don't know why he's looking at that but i it made me think of these quotes and i had them in my in my notes there so i just pulled them out now this ain't got to be right but i'm just going to tell you brother brother in 1962 he said this i understand that everybody that won't agree and come into the international agreement of this fellowship that they're trying to put and unite all the churches together the federation's churches that all that won't come in and unite with it they're making them a little province and they're going to send them to alaska yeah that's a free trip brother amen i think my words influence of another they all they won't come in and unite with they're making them a little province and then send them to alaska yeah so we might have a cruise coming up already amen all right brother ram goes on to say you might as well get ready for cold weather because it looks like it's gone yeah that was cheaper than all of them in that book yeah that's when that squeeze comes now right that's all right he didn't just say it once any of you want to go to alaska here's your trip i'm getting ready to read it to you ready this is in a god same year 1962 october they see the hours closing in fog is coming over the earth great the creeds and things are uniting together i didn't give the brother these so thank god you just listen churches are confederating coming together and oh god how they're going to say all that has a peculiarity will have it will have to leave here and go to alaska and all these things that they're threatening it's not new to us the great god has showed us that in the path of the word we're just passing through that part of it right try it blasphemous names man we may go home and pack what do you think this woman her power and you see right now where they're going to take all the people that's got odd ideas about religion and send them to alaska right just go and pack our bags yeah i don't know if we all get to make the trip somebody undoubtedly is heading to alaska that's all i want to say about that that is not a mental squeeze that's right all i want to say to you the squeeze is the final fulfillment of this time of great wrath right right and it's not the enemy coming against you because you're you it's the enemy coming against the word right the squeeze is a move against the word it's not a move against wade and tom and terence and brother sam and our brother donnie over there the squeezing doesn't affect him because his brother donnie it's going to affect him because he's part it's not a personal onslaught of the enemy it's a move against the word right and all those who have been united with the word cannot unite themselves right with that spirit that's right over and over and over over and over brother adam lets us know i don't know when they're going to close it up and make it a storehouse i don't know if it's going to happen in every message church or some messenger right i don't know if all message believers get to go to alaska right back and christ the mystery of god revealed they're going to bring a persecution on pretty soon and shut up all the churches and churches like this who's not a denomination they'll use them for a storehouse and anything and if any man goes and offer a prayer for anybody else that don't belong to the economic economical movement will be shot on the spot right how is that a mental squeeze come on brothers and sisters exactly i don't know how bad nobody wants to talk about that right nobody wants to look forward to this day over and over brother branham keeps going through these things thing but there's one thing about it over and over you'll find there's a man here that can turn on the light when the persecution comes what's his advice don't get scared don't get scared there's a light he said he would catch his people away she'll not go through the tribulation she'll never do it and he said she wouldn't she'll be caught away right how are they gonna do it brother branham it looks awful dark no matter how dark it gets right if you can't see your hand before you just remember there's a man here that can hurt all right he will rapture i don't know how much of it we're going to see i hope i don't see none right i hope all of those quotes are just for y'all and he'll leave me alone i really do i'm sorry brother let me tell you something you better sure get christ in your heart right because there's coming a time where you're really going to need it right exactly it looks like they're going to force us everyone you got to come in or they're going to close you up right and you know what's going to happen while we're not a denomination you know what's going to happen to a little group like this does this sound like a mental squeeze you're going to pay for it boys that's exactly right we're going to go out with a it's the last punch it's the final stage of that final punch that satan has on the church my brother ran him over and over over and over as he went through these quotes he mentions this several times watch that third full man amen watch that's why we don't have to be scared because we believe right i believe the true report believe when that final punch comes down when that great wrath of satan takes its turn and ever how it manifests right man there's a man here that can turn on the light after a short and powerful demonstration of the spirit this little hunted and persecuted group right we'll go to be with jesus that's right oh my we'll be able to weather it brothers and sisters all right i know one time i was talking about the squeeze a man came up mad at me because we've even talked about i don't want to think about that well don't think about it right but i believe it prepares us a stack of them here over and over preparing us right preparing us now getting us ready right for that last punch that's coming our way i'm still glad knowing how dark it looks out there knowing how drew i'm still glad right to be the one that can take that last punch i'm glad to be in a body that's going to be changed and the punch won't hurt that's what i'm looking for glory he's preparing us for it now he's ready for it now that's right let me read you another quote in possessing the enemy's gates maybe they'll find this one if they're 59 1108 possession i like this quote god's getting us ready for that fight he's building up soldiers he's building up shoulders it was moses after being also in the line of this royal seat of abraham that when he was sent down into egypt to deliver the children of israel god had given signs and wonders to perform to smite the earth to bring forth frogs and fleas and darkness and hail and rain and fire and he'd done all these miracles yet when he led them out by the hand of jehovah there'd come a time when he met the gate between him and the promised land and there was the red sea a bar across the way they were hemmed in by pharaoh's army mountains and deserts in the red sea but moses stepped forward and possessed the gate of his emmy across the red sea dry shot as he was walking on a dusty road you shall possess the gate of the enemy i like that picture you put up there right there the other night about the crossing of the red sea i don't know where he got there was it was just an awful narrow line it's going to take two million people a long time to get across right now but then chariots wouldn't make catch them it didn't matter how long i was envisioned just a little wider way but that's okay that was alright that was a good picture anyway i appreciate that you shall put god said so but it was yeah they come out under a great victory but it was a few years later when the trials come and the church got all shook up and look what brethren said it is so easy for a congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen the way that it's supposed to be what's brother it's easy for a church to get sugar but things don't just seem to happen the way that it's supposed to be god makes it that way amen god brings tensions into the church for every son that cometh to god must be tried and proven right and tested he let sickness strike you he lets diseases come on you to test you and approve you to show the world that you're truly the seed of abraham he permits it by his own will amen he permits disasters he permits the friends to turn against you he permits all these things and turns the devil loose to tempt you and he'll do all but take your life he could throw you on a bit of affliction he could turn your neighbors against you he could turn the church against you he can do most anything and it's god's will for him to do it amen we are taught that it is more precious than goldfest that's right oh my brothers and sisters i know what you're thinking i don't care if the neighbors don't think much of me he can turn the neighbors against you he can turn the church against you and it's god's will for that man but all we just if you're like me you just want to cry for a little while get that out of your system right come on god can't help you through all them tears stand up he's making a soldier out of him he permits these things right he permits disasters he permits friends he permits the devil to turn loose on you he can throw you on how many of us have symptoms through these all these we've felt them we felt them our friends have turned against us our neighbors what about abraham with isaac on the mountain the one that his the promise was given and by his loyalty and knowing his faith in jehovah it's through that and that alone that god looked down and said his seed shall possess again i've sworn by myself and i'll do these things there's no greater thing he could swear by but he swore by himself then if he let abraham be tested at that final point he's got to test you and me in that final moment right that time of decision you know what he's talking about is when he asked abraham after giving him the promised son right he asked him to go up there and offer him up on the mountain brother brown in one place call that a double test right talk about a test this was a double test here is your heir you waited all these years to get him and now i want you to give him back to you right right and abraham passed that double test that's why he was making a soldier out of him he was building him up he was preparing him for life last night brothers and sisters i believe god is taking our little battles and our little skirmishes and our little fights and our little disappointments and our little focuses that we get into along the way right and he's building an army he's building a body that when that time comes when that big punch comes your way when that final strike of the enemy comes our way in the form of a squeeze watch that third pull down he's got a people preparing that is watching it moving their lives now amen he says what we've seen temporarily now you're going to see it manifest in its fullness i don't mean we just sit around and wait on something that's happening now all right he is preparing us now that's right i had to bring this party i was reading today and it just it just so fit the sermon so well i added it to some of these thoughts i like what brother brandon said here it's in a message called presuming presuming i may remember a man that he talked about that he trained in boxing with six seconds smith yeah you mean i love this quote you remember six seconds smith yeah this is unpresuming when i first started training for boxing before i got in professional fighting there used to be a trainer called him six seconds smith the first professional fight he had he whipped the man in six seconds well that's a good nickname if you can do that right and when i started training that man liked to kill me he had knocked me plum out of the ring and everything else and i was skipping ropes and running seven eight miles every day and taking all the training and i said six why do you have to do me that way see i said you just knocked the breath out of me man i went plumb over four ropes come right out of there in amongst some chairs and like to broke my back on them and he laughed and said that'll do you good oh sure brother was thinking good yeah in fact i said do me good how can it do me good you're about to kill me and he said look billy i don't care how physically fit you arm your body's got to be able to stand that and come back right quick right if you take a hard punch said if your body's not used to coming back you'll lay there and take the count yeah but if your body's used to taking it and then coming back every time you hit it that shocks the blood runs it back to the heart but said if you do that said then your body's used to coming back quick when you get knocked down brother snaps his fingers you're on your feet again see that don't mean a thing when you get knocked down you're up on your feet again quick said you hate me now but you'll appreciate me when you get out there in the rain that was right a lesson from six seconds smith you've got to be conditioned right conditioning is what we're going through now we have our pressures in this life now and we see the hand of god we hear the testimonies i had a pain and god delivered me all right i know everybody's saying well everybody has pains but maybe you just want to live with yours this brother wanted to be delivered so it became god's provided way and god proved that for what about one of these days when it's a harder pain and he needs that same god it's because he's already proven the word amen prove me and see this is what brother branham is telling us he says you might hate me now but you're going to appreciate it one of these days when that hits coming down right when that last punch is coming your way you're going to appreciate that god has showed you right how to be a real soldier how to get back up and not just lay down there foreign i believe brothers and sisters i believe i believe this body this bride this elect lady is gonna have what it takes to stand until the end it may not be me i want to take brother branham's brother brown's hand on that it may not be me maybe i won't have faith enough to do it but somebody is going through him trouble with everybody wants you to believe it's them that's why sex fly off that's why things father said you can't get into my church even get it nowhere well that's just as wrong as romney's ever been that's where cults have raised up in this message and gather men around themselves oh there's one quote i want to read you and this is the brother i'm talking about the condition of the ministry today look in this quote it's in satan's eden in 1965 oh my the theme of it is today this is a paragraph 108 the thing of it is is today we don't try to establish the word of god in the people's hearts we are trying to establish ourselves right how many of you run into god like that it's all about me mine us them my brothers and sisters we don't try to establish the word of god in the people's hearts we are trying to establish ourselves right churches are trying to establish the doctrine of the church in a person's heart right we are commanded to establish the word of god amen paul said i didn't come to you with the enticing words of man that your faith might rest up in the knowledge of man but i come to you in power in manifestations of the holy ghost that your faith might rest in god there you are man mustn't establish yourself oh what a statement man mustn't establish yourself right we find it amongst let god do something for a person and send him out you find every man trying to impersonate it see they're trying to establish themselves right every man i did this me i mine my denomination me this establishing themselves what are we preaching about ourselves or the kingdom of god establish the word of god that's our goal tonight establish the word of god take out the unbelief and establish the kingdom of god in a man's heart and the kingdom of god cannot be established in a man's heart unless god made that man thus right right oh my and remember the deceitful part that man think that it's right there's a way that seemeth right unto a man every intellectual being seems right we run into a lot of them this is the only way i heard brother neville say this morning someone might have asked him why i didn't preach on the holy ghost why didn't i do this here it is you ready here it is you want a lesson on the holy ghost here it is the holy ghost is the action in you it's a life it's a life not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence but it is the person amen jesus christ the word of god established in your heart to quicken every word of this age amen right watch the holy ghost in action not so much in denial not so much in demonstrations but in action what it does according to the word you want to know if you got the holy ghost how do you know not in emotions i mean motion isn't going to tell you you've got the holy ghost right brother brown said the evidence of the holy ghost is when you can say amen every that's the word of the baptism of the holy ghost right well i didn't feel nothing who cares when did it become feelings anyway in some of the greatest miracles where you wake up one morning you don't feel nothing feeling nothing is a good thing right right the man i don't know who's whose testimony it was he had a pain in his arm he woke up and he felt nothing that's a good thing having the holy ghost and feeling nothing right away with experience as you're measuring life come on brothers and sisters so many people you especially out in these youth camps and i'm not against youth camp all right all right i'm halfway against youth camp yeah i would get some youth camps all right but people get out and that's all they want to do is get the holy ghost get the holy ghost get the holy ghost get the holy ghost and they get the same crowd back next year and they're getting them the holy ghost again and they come back the next year and guess what they're still doing they're getting the holy ghost again away with that my dear brothers and sisters what is the holy ghost it is the life of christ in you they lay hold on that promise may not have one ounce of emotion behind it right hard may not have one else none i want to ask you when brother brown was carefully explaining to us the life of christ coming into mary what did mary feel right what's the word he used nothing that's right mary felt nothing right yet she was impregnated by the life of god and she felt nothing right that's enough feeling nothing is enough right i know we're going to get you just somebody can jump up back there and maybe i know you're thinking already well brother i'm feeling if you don't feel nothing you're dead you're dead to the world brothers and sisters i believe god is conditioning us for this i believe he's getting us ready i believe we got some sick second smiths out there teaching us the way man you're not gonna do it they're gonna pound us they're gonna smack us around they're gonna knock his plum over four ropes and into those chairs and we're gonna think we broke our back right it's gonna hurt everybody all right but then the pain will leave all right maybe you'll feel nothing and you'll learn i don't know medically how accurate that is i you know i know everybody that's got complaints about brother brown i'm sure some doctor will raise them see that ain't how it works at all well it works good enough for me that way all right right if he learned it from six seconds that's a lesson i want to learn that's right i want to believe that god is right now conditioning me as a part of this bride for that last big punch is going to come one way for that last big onslaught right and when that squeeze comes down brother wade calls and tells me i just got a free trip set up for alaska it ain't gonna be fun but he'd be here somebody's gonna head there it may not be me it might be him he's got his book laid out he might be planning on it i don't know i don't have an alaska brochure on my desk i believe god right is going to have us ready for that glory amen i don't think we're going to wake up we're just going to hide in our closet crying and sniveling and we're going to remember this life amen we're going to remember right he had a trial along this way right we're going to remember when we got knocked over than four ropes and into the chairs and thought our back was broke and we're going to remember god doing something for us and we're going to remember and something in our hearts is going to raise up and say you know i remember when that third pull was temporarily manifested when i saw the opening of the word move in my life and the word go out there and heal me i'm going to remember that right and now that i really need it and now that this big lick has come i'm going to be able to take it i believe god is doing that for his family i believe we're part of it i'm glad to be part of it i'm glad to be in the end time when the last big lick of satan is coming right because you know what ain't gonna hurt nobody else after that right you remember school when they used to pick on your little sister you got to go through me you know i'm willing to take it for her all right why because it's good it's the last one right that's the last one amen don't you love him do you believe it's real sir i believe it i believe jesus said he's looking at an oncoming storm that's coming i believe he's conditioning this amen conditioning you might hear some hard things come over this pulpit most pulpits have hard things they're they're true ones that's right brother i said why do you want to just go to church if they just pet the babies and marry the women and marry the some churches they marry several women but we're not going to talk about that that's those guys over there in that pile of scarecrow yeah don't get discouraged by all of that no right don't get all alarmed this person right here is doing that what do you think of that i don't think nothing of that i just think he's not called to the same word that i'm i am called to a life of purity and holiness under this word and i'm called to a promise and it becometh me to fulfill that i don't fulfill this word because i'm supposed to unfulfill it because it's becoming due right now it's calling me it's drawing me that's it and it's preparing me you believe it live it man let's stand up and what can we see what do you want to say all right take it over there my brother god bless you all i my oh it will never fall down do you believe that there'll be a time of persecution a priesthood ever since i've been here there'll be a time of persecution not a tribulation period we don't go there how can you read the quotes that the prophet says when that third pool watch it he said when the persecution comes watch that third pool well now okay now we got a quote for that the third pool is for the bride and the church until you go a little so you can put anything you want and i believe we need something to put us in that place amen and if god wants to send it our way let it come just give me grace to stand right right that's it let's see what happened spring little sweet chariot 160. you might have a need yeah come back to me is he let him is through the darkness sweet all and we'll all be introduced to christ so you see that's what's already happening here that's right but we're going to see him everybody for ourselves one more i just won't take a little bit of time amen a little bit oh we're not in darkness we like everybody else we'll be going down oh hello glory glory don't come late and think you can get your picture made a lot of people think the world gotta revolve around them but you don't want it revolved around me because i'm the guy in charge and if you don't come you make sure you tell brother tom how much you understand we really do appreciate you staying appreciated honestly appreciate the love in his heart appreciate his life coming with him and then coming out of fellowship with us and just thank god and you pray for

thank you for your word that you've given unto us and truly we realize and know that satan's got to punch at us but we try to keep that place covered and then in doing that learn lord we learn that
