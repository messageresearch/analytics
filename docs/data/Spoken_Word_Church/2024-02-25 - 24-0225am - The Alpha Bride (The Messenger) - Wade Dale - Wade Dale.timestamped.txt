[20:10] miracle working God we still believe
[20:12] that God's on the scene he hadn't left
[20:14] us he said he'd never leave us he'd
[20:16] never forsake us even in the darkest
[20:18] hour you know sometimes you can think we
[20:21] think back and what happened with with
[20:24] that and different ones and last night
[20:26] we were watching uh
[20:29] brother Ron Spencer I know most of you
[20:30] all know him and he's been fighting
[20:32] cancer now for they told him two years
[20:35] ago he had four months so but he stood
[20:39] before his congregation last Sunday
[20:41] night and told him he had two
[20:45] months you think you got
[20:48] problems that's what's facing him but
[20:50] you know what they said that two years
[20:53] ago that's right but it's Advanced into
[20:56] his eyes and and he just looked at his
[20:58] congregation and and and the way that
[21:01] same way that I feel that we watched a
[21:03] lot of you grow up he W he dedicated a
[21:05] lot of babies and then he dedicated a
[21:07] lot of babies of the babies that he
[21:08] dedicated he buried some he brought some
[21:11] in and he over he looked them looked at
[21:14] him and he said when you think you got
[21:16] problems just remember
[21:18] me but he
[21:21] preached like he never preached
[21:24] before he preached on the
[21:27] duel u e l The
[21:29] Duel guess who wins The Duel every time
[21:33] you can rewind it as many times as you
[21:34] want to God
[21:37] wins you rewind it again it's like the
[21:39] turtle in the hair you can read every
[21:41] book you want to uh of the different uh
[21:43] different writers or different copies of
[21:46] it and turtle always wins God always
[21:50] wins he will not be defeated uh it's a
[21:53] dark hour for for a lot of people but
[21:56] God's still on the scene and God's still
[21:58] in control sir and we believe that God's
[22:01] here to answer your prayer today and
[22:03] we're going to talk about that first
[22:05] church today we're going to talk about a
[22:06] little bit about the messenger but we're
[22:07] going to talk about that first church
[22:09] how they stood
[22:11] persecution uh they
[22:13] stood um the religious group of the day
[22:17] that wanted to kill them and they killed
[22:19] all the all the uh all the disciples
[22:21] except for John they died very shortly
[22:24] after Jesus after Jesus went off the
[22:27] scene because of their stand for God
[22:31] Amen so now if the alpha bride's that
[22:33] way then the Omega Brides coming to a
[22:35] time that where even brother Ry says
[22:36] that they will kill your influence they
[22:38] don't have to kill you and you you know
[22:40] die or personal death but but you can
[22:43] have your influence killed but you can
[22:45] also have your influence raised up as
[22:48] with John and different ones that come
[22:50] went to the aisle of patmas and and God
[22:52] wanted him to write down and send it to
[22:54] the churches so we're part of that
[22:55] church I mean we're we're in lay of see
[22:58] I know we're not part of it but we get
[23:00] the good and we get the bad that's right
[23:02] all right so we're here today to um to
[23:05] tell you that we love you we thank him
[23:08] next Sunday you
[23:09] pray you pray and you pray some more if
[23:14] you don't have a prayer closet build
[23:16] one all
[23:18] right serious serious for all of us but
[23:22] we love you with the love of the Lord
[23:23] and thank you so much I I ask U I ask
[23:27] Dad
[23:28] in March we were sitting on a porch and
[23:30] this was before that uh he became a
[23:33] little bit uh incoherent and and um we
[23:36] were sitting there and and and I I
[23:38] looked at him I said hey look at me he
[23:41] looked at me and I
[23:43] said if you're ready to come
[23:46] back I said you let me
[23:48] know if you're ready to come we'll
[23:53] open everything we can open up to get
[23:55] you
[23:56] here he said
[23:59] no I'm not
[24:01] ready and I'll not tell you what he said
[24:04] after
[24:05] that that was personal to
[24:07] me but he said I'm not
[24:09] ready he said I'm not ready to come back
[24:13] so and and listen we pray all the time
[24:16] God
[24:17] raise raise him up we need people like
[24:20] that we need the the older group brother
[24:22] collie brother Dy and different ones
[24:24] that stood in in the in the the bushes
[24:27] and kick back to bushes just so that we
[24:28] can have a a better place and a better
[24:31] opportunity to serve the
[24:34] Lord
[24:35] amen think about it we've had a lot of
[24:38] Warriors leave the place too you know a
[24:40] lot of Warriors have left and the
[24:41] Warriors that have left they had
[24:43] something to do with yes sir everything
[24:46] that goes on in the whole functioning of
[24:48] the church the whole function of your
[24:50] life and my life we live together yes
[24:53] amen a real true Ministry like us we
[24:57] live with the people we don't just pop
[24:58] in and preach that's an evangelist
[25:00] Brother David Gman popped in he preaches
[25:02] does a real good job did the best job I
[25:04] ever heard him last Sunday actually I
[25:05] told him that but he goes off and does
[25:07] that somewhere else but but when you
[25:09] take the other part of the fivefold
[25:11] ministry you have to live with the
[25:12] people you have to be here with you and
[25:15] and be sorrowful when you're sorrowful
[25:17] be happy when you're happy and then be
[25:19] happy when you're
[25:20] sorrowful okay so um just remember all
[25:24] that also on the 10th and I want to
[25:26] appreciate uh the song leaders uh
[25:29] brother Joe Canada um we had a last week
[25:32] they had a meeting with all the

[28:41] harp and he started playing
[28:44] heart Maybe started singing some of the
[28:46] Psalms that we that brother collie and
[28:48] and the responsive reading uh brothers

[29:18] earth oh to the world we we're
[29:20] insignificant we don't mean anything and
[29:22] we're just quacks and Cs and we believe
[29:25] this different Doctrine and we have this
[29:28] different idea and we live different we
[29:31] act different we talk different praise
[29:33] God that we are separated that you
[29:37] separated us from the world and the
[29:39] things of the world that will not come
[29:41] into that condemnation that the world is
[29:42] going to have Lord that we'll be carried
[29:45] away from this place in a moment in the
[29:46] twinkling of an eye father that's what
[29:48] we're heading toward lord it's not
[29:50] something Lord that's that's too far
[29:52] away I don't believe Lord I believe it's
[29:54] coming Lord in in in fast fast manner
[29:57] and father I pray that we not get left
[29:59] behind and as brother Dell always said I
[30:01] hope we're not at the train station with
[30:03] a plane ticket Lord I pray that we're at
[30:05] this place that we need with the ticket
[30:07] that we need to get on board to get out
[30:09] of here father forgive us of our sins

[30:14] dad different ones mom and Lily and uh
[30:18] all the ones are sick Lord I pray that
[30:20] You' touch their body Lord You Are the
[30:21] Healer you're doing it anyway you're
[30:23] healing through the body and people

[30:27] healing them Lord thank you for that
[30:29] father thank you for being merciful
[30:31] thank you for grace and thank you for
[30:33] the love that you bestowed upon your
[30:35] people father we ask these things in
[30:37] Jesus name amen and we'll try to get to
[30:39] the messenger but the alpha bride I've
[30:41] kind of got a little something I want to
[30:43] I want to bring to you because remember
[30:45] that Alpha bride whatever that Alpha
[30:46] bride is that's what we are supposed to
[30:47] be Mirror Image but now remember we have
[30:51] a
[30:52] plus plus the opening of the seals plus
[30:55] the body change that we're requireed
[30:57] ired to come to that they weren't
[30:59] required to come to all right so we have
[31:01] everything plus not plus another
[31:04] messenger plus another Bible plus
[31:06] another no it's more Revelation being
[31:09] revealed to us than it was to them all
[31:12] right Revelations one ver10 says I was
[31:14] in the spirit on the Lord's day and
[31:15] heard behind me a a great voice as of a
[31:18] trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the
[31:20] first and the last what thou seest right
[31:22] in the book and send it into the seven
[31:24] churches which are in Asia the Ephesus
[31:26] Smyrna pamas thyra Sardis Philadelphia
[31:29] and L out a sip and I turned to see the
[31:31] voice that spake with me and being
[31:33] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[31:35] and in the midst of the seven golden
[31:37] candlesticks one liken to the son of man
[31:39] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[31:41] and G about the paps with the golden
[31:43] girdle Revelations 1:16 you can be
[31:46] seated and he had in his right hand
[31:48] Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a
[31:51] sharp two-edged sword as we were talking
[31:53] about the other day God is going to make
[31:56] sure we get the right right message amen
[31:58] from the right person because he holds
[32:01] those seven stars in his hand not in a
[32:03] bishop hand not in an Elder's hand he
[32:05] holds not even in an angel's hand that's
[32:07] right he holds it in his hand and we're
[32:10] going to see in just a minute that truly
[32:13] when God unfolds himself through those
[32:15] prophets or Messengers it is the logos
[32:18] or the speech of almighty God coming
[32:20] through
[32:21] them that's why we call it the voice of
[32:24] God in the end time all right well we
[32:26] could call it the voice of God if we
[32:28] needed to back in Paul's time irenius
[32:30] Martin Columban all the different ones
[32:32] all right but he had in his right hand
[32:33] Seven Stars and out of his mouth with a
[32:35] sharp two-edged sword so in other words
[32:37] he didn't just have the stars in his
[32:38] hand he had them there for a purpose
[32:40] there was something going to come forth
[32:42] from them which was a sharp two-edged
[32:44] sword which we know is the word of God
[32:47] all right not man's ideas but the word
[32:49] of God for the people that need it for
[32:53] the day and hour that they're living in
[32:54] all right cuz remember Luther's message
[32:56] will not do us any good we love the Lord
[32:58] we we we love justification but
[33:00] justification in its baby form won't
[33:02] even get you to be
[33:05] bride but it did for hundreds of
[33:07] thousands of them back in Luther's day
[33:08] but remember God comes on through as we
[33:10] were reading the other day the life
[33:12] comes from the seed to the stop to the
[33:15] shook to the tussel all the way out to
[33:18] produce corn again well we at to
[33:20] producing corn again to look like the
[33:23] original ybody with me Revelations 1:20
[33:26] the mystery of the Seven Stars which
[33:29] thou saw us in see God thought so much
[33:30] of this mystery he didn't leave it
[33:34] open-ended he told you what they were
[33:36] right the Seven Stars are the Angels and
[33:39] the Seven candlesticks are the seven
[33:41] churches so he pretty much took all
[33:43] man's ideas out and said this is this
[33:46] and this is this all right and I've got
[33:48] them all in my hand I'm standing in the
[33:50] midst of them I'm going to do this
[33:52] there's nobody else going to do now
[33:54] Satan's going to come in and try to
[33:55] muddle it all up and he knew that
[33:57] but he's going to have a bride everybody
[34:00] with me so that means he was in the
[34:02] midst of the church or the middle or
[34:04] amongst the church Amos 5:8 even tells
[34:08] us that seek him that maketh the Seven
[34:10] Stars and a now we see the Seven Stars
[34:13] is who he hold in his hand and there's a
[34:15] message behind that with with oy but
[34:17] we'll wait a little bit later on with
[34:19] that and turth the shadow of death into
[34:21] the
[34:22] morning when God sends a messenger on
[34:24] the scene it's life amen it's it's light
[34:28] it's to get rid of the darkness that
[34:30] come in from the
[34:33] people and maketh the day dark with
[34:35] night that calleth for the Waters of the
[34:37] sea and porth them out upon the face of
[34:39] the Earth the Lord is his
[34:42] name so the seven Church ages remember
[34:45] is a complete and final revelation of
[34:48] Jesus Christ to the Gentile Nations now
[34:50] he's not the final Revelation to the
[34:52] Jews he's not the final Revelation to
[34:55] the foolish virgin
[34:57] he's not over there yet that he's got to
[34:59] be revealed to them yes all right but to
[35:02] you and I as a gentile Nation when the
[35:05] seven Church ages are complete for us
[35:08] the bride takes her last call we're
[35:10] sealed in everybody else is sealed out
[35:13] and we're going to a marriage supper all
[35:15] right and that's the nation that you and
[35:16] I are in right now we're in God's Nation
[35:18] today by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[35:21] all right and it started all new and I I
[35:24] was thinking about this the other day it
[35:26] was a new concept you know I say concept
[35:29] Loosely but it was something new when
[35:31] when when even when John the Baptist
[35:33] stood and said Behold the Lamb of God
[35:35] well the the priests were going they
[35:37] were looking for a lamb right cuz that's
[35:41] what they're used to they weren't used
[35:42] to God being in human flesh come on
[35:43] somebody so it was all new to them
[35:46] that's why John had to be so adamant he
[35:48] said hey you
[35:50] vipers you snakes yes you're holding
[35:54] this from the people there's your
[35:57] Messiah the one you're asking for he's
[36:00] standing right
[36:02] there plain view so it was new that's
[36:06] why there had to be a new as Paul says
[36:08] in Hebrews 10 a new dispensation or a
[36:11] New and Living Way there had to be a a
[36:14] New and Living Way coming from Luther
[36:16] coming from Wesley coming from Pentecost
[36:18] to this end time all right which he has
[36:22] cons consecrated for us through the veil
[36:24] that is to say his flesh so there
[36:27] something came on on the scene called
[36:29] The Flesh of God right the Flesh of
[36:32] animals was
[36:34] before I was telling them at work they
[36:36] were talking about Jesus and and the new
[36:38] movie called Chosen and and and I like
[36:41] it cuz it it kind of humanizes the Lord
[36:44] and um I appreciate them doing it that
[36:46] way but they were talking about the New
[36:48] Testament New Testament I said you know
[36:52] me I said that movie wasn't made in the
[36:56] new test
[36:59] that movie was made in the Old Testament
[37:00] and they're like you know how they
[37:06] go I said let's read Hebrews 9 verse1 14
[37:11] amen cuz there's something new when
[37:14] Jesus held that cup up he said this is
[37:15] the New Testament in my blood so the
[37:19] book of Acts would be your first book of
[37:22] the New Testament Matthew Martin Luke
[37:24] and John is a commentary or a or are a
[37:27] um um I guess you might say a story not
[37:30] a story it's true but it's four
[37:32] different people telling you four
[37:34] different things sometimes come on now
[37:37] all right that's right right all right
[37:40] all y'all I believe all of you today got
[37:41] the Holy Ghost all right we're going to
[37:42] use this in the in the uh when we get to
[37:45] the uh Alpha bride everybody's in here I
[37:48] believe F filled with the baptism of the
[37:49] Holy Ghost how many of you drove a
[37:51] Chevrolet to work to church today don't
[37:54] be ashamed you Chevrolet drivers
[37:58] Ford there's
[38:02] prayer
[38:04] Toyota
[38:07] Nissan but you all came to the same
[38:10] place we had one common goal they had
[38:14] one common goal in the old test in the
[38:15] in not Old Testament in the first church
[38:17] age was to get this new testament or
[38:20] this new way this New and Living Way uh
[38:24] man I think about the Ethiopian unit
[38:26] he's he's sitting on his Chariot and
[38:28] they what I mean he was a man of
[38:31] status he wasn't in a buggy or or or o
[38:35] cart he was in a chariot and he had
[38:38] picked up a message book
[38:41] somewhere and he was reading
[38:43] it and what did it take it took somebody
[38:47] that had the Holy Ghost for God to send
[38:53] Phil and he says tell me is this talking
[38:56] about this guy or is it talking about
[38:57] this guy he was in the Old Testament pH
[39:00] let me explain to you just like what
[39:03] Steven did now but Steven Steven's a
[39:05] little bit different we'll get to him a
[39:07] little bit later but remember Steven got
[39:08] killed for what he
[39:10] preached but when he started out he was
[39:12] among all the Sanhedrin and he's telling
[39:14] them
[39:15] hey The Ten Commandments didn't come
[39:18] right here the Ten Commandments was out
[39:20] in the desert he's telling them all
[39:23] these things were out here out here out
[39:25] here and we've missed a lot of things in
[39:27] there and they're going you know like
[39:28] most of you you going yeah that's right
[39:30] praise the Lord amen amen but you killed
[39:34] him you killed
[39:37] him you crucified him and you killed him
[39:40] what the Bible say they nasted at their
[39:42] heart and they got so mad at him they
[39:44] killed him right they physically bashed
[39:46] his head in because of what he was
[39:51] different he was showing them a New and
[39:53] Living Way but praise God before he died
[39:56] died Steven looks up in heaven he says
[39:58] father don't lay this to their charge
[40:01] because there was a guy standing there
[40:03] his name was sa he was holding their
[40:06] coats he consented to what was going on
[40:09] but God was going to use that guy listen
[40:11] go through the Bible there is not one of
[40:13] you would pick anybody that God picked
[40:15] in the Bible to do his
[40:18] work would you pick Moses
[40:23] murderer run away from God HD for 40
[40:26] years
[40:27] huh would you P
[40:30] David
[40:32] murderer liar a
[40:37] doter would you pick
[40:42] shamgar would you would have
[40:46] picked anybody you want would you pick
[40:50] Paul we're going to read here just a
[40:52] little bit about the messenger when this
[40:54] messenger first started out he Pur
[40:56] persecuted the people he preached
[41:00] to and I'll promise you when anas when
[41:03] God said anas there's a man coming to
[41:05] your house his name is Saul and is like
[41:08] oh hold on a minute but you know what he
[41:12] obeyed what God said that's the key I
[41:14] want you all to see in that first church
[41:16] age they obeyed what God told
[41:19] them and they did what God
[41:22] said listen even though ion was looking
[41:25] at at when Saul comes in and he looks
[41:28] he's he's thinking in his mind that man
[41:30] put my mama in
[41:32] prison that man had my grandmother and
[41:35] grandfather
[41:39] killed but Saul you've been
[41:43] chos and he laid his hands on him and he
[41:45] got filled with the Holy
[41:47] Ghost Hebrews 9 ver14 how much more
[41:49] shall the blood of Christ who through
[41:51] the eternal spirit offered himself
[41:52] without spot to God Purge your
[41:54] conscience and their cons ious could not
[41:56] be purged in the Old Testament it can
[41:59] only be forgiven they reply they you
[42:01] know they they just the lamb was it and
[42:04] then you just went out and did what you
[42:05] wanted to not anymore but it C it
[42:09] couldn't Purge your dead your conscience
[42:10] from dead works and for this cause he is
[42:13] a mediator so in other words of the New
[42:14] Testament that by means of death because
[42:17] remember he had to Die the testator has
[42:20] to die before a New Testament comes into
[42:22] force all right is everybody with me so
[42:25] the first testament was what the Old
[42:28] Testament uh for the Redemption of the
[42:30] transgression that were under the first
[42:33] testament they which are called might
[42:35] receive the promise of Eternal
[42:37] inheritance which is the baptism of the
[42:39] Holy Ghost we know that for where a
[42:41] testament is there must also of
[42:43] necessity be the death of the
[42:46] testator for a testament is a force
[42:49] after men are dead so Jesus had to die
[42:51] to start a new testament all right
[42:53] everybody with me it says look it is it
[42:56] is of no
[42:57] strength while he's
[43:01] here let me tell you something Jesus
[43:04] didn't save one person while he was
[43:06] walking on the
[43:07] Earth but he's a savior of the world
[43:10] Amen they didn't understand him he had
[43:12] to come back in this new way through a
[43:16] group of people called his bride and
[43:19] called as we are looking now at Bishops
[43:22] Elders Paul set the church up the way
[43:24] God wanted it set up not the way he
[43:25] wanted it set up all right so each age
[43:29] had his message and his messenger all
[43:31] through the times every age has packed
[43:33] his message with a messenger god in
[43:36] every dispensation has sent forth
[43:38] someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit to
[43:40] bring forth his message for that age
[43:42] every time and I want to reiterate for
[43:44] all these idiots that are on the
[43:46] internet that are saying brother random
[43:47] was not him he was not Mali for then God
[43:52] you got to send me somebody and you got
[43:54] to send him to me quick
[43:56] before the great and dareful day of the
[43:58] Lord because you promised it well I
[44:01] declare to you today he's already
[44:05] sinning Jesus came and they never who
[44:07] knew who he was and they were looking
[44:09] for
[44:10] him here's the plan of it here's what I
[44:13] want to break this down for you a little
[44:14] bit before we get get into it the first
[44:16] thing happens there's an announcement in
[44:17] heaven brother r on the first seal he's
[44:19] telling you how each Church age is set
[44:21] up now listen I want to ask you one more
[44:23] time does God ever make a mistake God
[44:26] ever lie does God ever have to say oops
[44:29] does God ever
[44:31] redo he's perfect the first time so
[44:34] whatever he says that's what we do all
[44:37] right so now look what happened a seal
[44:39] is opened what is that a mystery is
[44:41] unfolded see when a mystery unfolds then
[44:44] a trumpet sounds and we know what a
[44:45] trumpet is it's a message it declares a
[44:48] war as brother Ron was preaching last
[44:51] Sunday a duel between right and wrong as
[44:53] brother Chris Long preached a couple
[44:55] years ago go about the conflict between
[44:58] God and Satan well the conflict between
[45:00] God and Satan is not God and Satan it's
[45:03] you our plague Falls and the church AE
[45:06] open listen why did God send a messenger
[45:09] cuz he had bride he had bride sent out
[45:12] there in the world he had bride sent in
[45:13] churches he had bride that were that
[45:15] were blinded as he was blinded that's
[45:18] right or a plague falls in the church
[45:20] age is open what is the war part the
[45:22] angel of the church catches the mystery
[45:23] of God not fully yet revealed but when
[45:25] he does he catches this mystery and I
[45:27] want you to put that in the back of your
[45:29] mind when we get to Paul and then he
[45:31] goes forth to the people after the
[45:33] mystery has been given to him he goes
[45:35] forth to the people what does he do out
[45:37] there he begins to declare that message
[45:39] and what does it start a war it starts a
[45:41] spiritual war as also like
[45:44] Paul did the same thing and so did
[45:47] stepen Paul got up before griin all the
[45:49] different ones right and he preached him
[45:51] a sermon well listen brother Brandon was
[45:54] the same thing he went to the
[45:55] Pentecostal people people they pulled on
[45:57] the signs they pulled on the gift they
[45:58] pulled on the Wonders but when he turned
[46:01] to the Pentecostals and he said you've
[46:03] lost your first love you've got away
[46:06] from this that speaking in tongues is
[46:07] not the evidence of the Holy Ghost what
[46:09] happened they nashed at their teeth and
[46:11] they did what they did what they did
[46:13] with Steven they killed his influence
[46:16] and they killed the man same thing it's
[46:18] the same Spirit folks I'm telling you
[46:20] the same spirit says here today as it
[46:22] was
[46:23] then then God takes his message with the
[46:26] elect of that age and lays them away
[46:28] asleep then he drops a plague upon them
[46:30] who rejected it a temporary judgment and
[46:33] then after that is over then he goes on
[46:35] and they denominate bring in
[46:37] denominations and start off with that
[46:39] man's work of Luther and the rest of
[46:40] them it gets into scrapple again in
[46:42] other words false Doctrine and then
[46:44] another mystery comes forth then what
[46:45] happens another messenger arrives on
[46:47] Earth for a church age now listen we're
[46:49] not looking for another one this is it
[46:52] and when he arrives the trumpet sounds
[46:54] he declares war then what happens
[46:56] finally he's caught away and when he's
[46:58] laid away a plague Falls destroys them
[47:01] spiritual death hits the church and
[47:02] she's gone that group now let me break
[47:04] that down for you real quick right here
[47:06] there's an announcement in heaven now we
[47:08] don't hear this announcement God has one
[47:11] person picked
[47:12] out Paul arenus Martin Columba Luther
[47:16] Wesley and William brandom everybody
[47:18] with me all right he knows that they
[47:22] don't
[47:23] yet listen Saul like I said before would
[47:26] you have pick Paul to write 80% of the
[47:29] Bible of the New
[47:31] Testament he was making people
[47:33] blasphemed he was putting them in prison
[47:36] he was having them put in there where
[47:37] they were put on The Gallows and killed
[47:39] he was making them do it right he was
[47:43] zealous oh give me that piece of paper
[47:45] I'm going to Damascus and I'm going to
[47:47] tear that church up well he got tore up
[47:49] for before he got there praise God he
[47:53] got blinded God smoted him blind and
[47:55] said hey you you're going to have to
[47:56] listen to one of my
[47:58] people you going to have to listen to
[48:00] anas to get them scales off your eyes so
[48:04] there's an announcement in heaven so out
[48:06] of the mind of God comes the logos a
[48:08] sealed up message is open in other words
[48:10] God's got it in his mind he knows he's
[48:13] going to have the church ages he knows
[48:15] that he's willing and able to do that
[48:18] but there's a group that's willing and
[48:19] able to receive it there's got to be
[48:21] work on both ends right that's like you
[48:24] pulling on the gift of God if you don't
[48:25] pull today that we're just going to
[48:26] muddle through and and plow as much as
[48:29] we can plow but if you'll pull on the
[48:30] gift of God and Saul get rid of them
[48:32] demons that you brought in here hello
[48:35] somebody I did
[48:38] too might as well be
[48:41] honest a sealed up message is
[48:45] open Paul steps on the
[48:48] scene he goes
[48:50] man I persecuted him but now I love him
[48:54] that's right
[48:56] I drove them to blaspheme now I'm trying
[48:59] my best to preach every day The
[49:01] unsearchable Riches of Jesus
[49:05] Christ so a mystery is unfolded to the
[49:08] star of the age in other words the
[49:09] messenger picks up the logos of God all
[49:13] right brother brandham he comes and and
[49:15] he's sitting in a cave and this Angel
[49:17] steps out of the light and he says I've
[49:19] been sent from the presence of God to
[49:21] bring you this message that you're going
[49:23] to do this and that and the other right
[49:25] that was a messenger sent from God and
[49:28] brother R fulfilled it he was not
[49:30] disobedient as Paul said to the heavenly
[49:32] vision praise God for that so the
[49:35] messenger picks up the logos of God in
[49:37] other words picks up the T the mind of
[49:38] God see what these people are doing when
[49:40] they're saying brother ranam was wrong
[49:43] they're saying God was
[49:46] wrong I don't want to be them on
[49:47] Judgment Day I do
[49:51] not so then a trumpet sounds so the
[49:53] messenger steps out and Paul declares
[49:56] and I'll read you in a few minutes he
[49:57] was pretty bold in declaring who he
[50:01] was if a messenger or an angel comes
[50:04] from heaven and preaches any other thing
[50:06] and you hear from me let him be a curse
[50:08] he said that twice he said you've come
[50:11] and you've you you've spoke these great
[50:13] beautiful words he said but it's added
[50:15] nothing to my Revelation we'll read that
[50:17] here in just a few minutes but it
[50:20] starts a message is proclaimed a church
[50:23] age begins in other words the people
[50:25] that SP supp to hear it start to hear it
[50:28] all right a church age begins a distinct
[50:30] and declared
[50:32] message for your time all right and it
[50:37] starts a spiritual war what Satan FS the
[50:41] pull of the
[50:43] righteous and he said I got to get into
[50:45] that I got to get into that and let Him
[50:47] worship me I want him to worship me not
[50:49] worship him they're worshiping oh my
[50:51] goodness let me just add a little bit in
[50:53] here a little bit in here and that's
[50:54] what happened right but praise God
[50:57] that's not going to happen in this age
[50:59] somebody's going to be the true word of
[51:02] God no false Doctrine so then the
[51:05] messenger brings his message he's laid
[51:08] Away Paul got his head chopped off all
[51:11] the different ones uh some of them were
[51:13] abruptly uh you know taken off the scene
[51:16] especially the 11 of the disciples were
[51:18] taken off the scene by hanging them
[51:20] upside down and pulling them apart and
[51:21] cutting their head off and all these
[51:23] different things we think we got
[51:24] problems
[51:25] yeah right to be killed for what you
[51:28] believe you have not done that
[51:30] yet so The Messengers is laid away or
[51:32] taken off the earth now look when
[51:35] they're taking off the Earth thank God
[51:37] we've had a prophet in the end time that
[51:39] when he was taken off the Earth we still
[51:42] have his voice amen we still have his
[51:44] 1100 sermons that he has that we can
[51:46] listen and we can go back but it's not
[51:49] just the books and tapes that's going to
[51:50] save you the books and tapes are not
[51:53] going to make you a mature Christian
[51:55] that's right it takes a five-fold
[51:57] Ministry because look if people didn't
[51:59] accept what Paul said because Paul would
[52:01] preach and then he would leave he was an
[52:04] apostle he set up a church and he well
[52:07] what Paul
[52:08] say by the word of the Lord I tell you
[52:10] this is what Paul said and by the Holy
[52:13] Ghost they had inside of them they
[52:14] believed it or if they didn't have the
[52:15] Holy Ghost they were pricked in their
[52:17] heart and there was a
[52:19] connection and that the way okay never
[52:21] mind so people accept it or reject it
[52:26] in every age there's people that accept
[52:27] it and people that reject it and then a
[52:29] temporary judgment or a plague spiritual
[52:32] death to the ones who reject their
[52:34] messenger so when brother randam was
[52:36] taken off the scene abruptly he was 56
[52:38] years old but
[52:40] listen and I say this lightly when God's
[52:43] finished with somebody he don't dilly
[52:44] dally
[52:45] around he takes them
[52:49] off you prove me wrong he's never let
[52:52] people go like Paul didn't continue on
[52:54] into Iranian his age no he don't bring
[52:56] two messages at the same time remember
[52:58] he stops one takes them off the scene
[53:01] brings one right on the scene and
[53:02] continues right on that's the way God
[53:04] said it and that's the way I believe it
[53:06] so spiritual death to the ones who
[53:08] reject their messenger well now brother
[53:10] R stood and he said there's 969
[53:12] different denominations you've heard him
[53:14] on the tape if you've listened 969
[53:17] Google how many there are
[53:19] today
[53:23] 13,000 and I did this several months ago
[53:25] so there's 14,000 maybe
[53:28] 13,000 different ideas to this right
[53:31] here that's
[53:32] right 969 when he was alive when God
[53:37] took the messenger off the scene and
[53:38] laid him away the people accepted it or
[53:41] rejected it when they rejected it what'
[53:43] they do they went into
[53:45] denominationalism they went into their
[53:47] own ideas they
[53:49] dead Bible says twice plucked up by the
[53:54] root my brother brand he didn't hate the
[53:56] people he hated the system that had
[53:58] begun but remember the system if you are
[54:01] part of the
[54:05] system you're part of the
[54:08] system that's why we don't want to be a
[54:10] part of that system we want to be a part
[54:11] of the Bride of Jesus Christ set apart
[54:14] from that spiritual death so then what
[54:18] happens then the messenger now the
[54:20] messenger goes off the scene and we'll
[54:21] realize here in the Middle Ages that
[54:24] Columba died before his church AE
[54:27] started so the message of Columba had to
[54:29] be preserved
[54:32] where and maybe a little bit writing
[54:34] down cuz he was in the middle of the
[54:35] Dark Ages maybe a little bit writing
[54:37] down what Columbus say well he
[54:40] said and the message continued on they
[54:44] didn't need a book or a
[54:46] tape don't get quiet on
[54:49] me do we need a quote for everything we
[54:53] say we need need the
[54:56] Bible but we don't need a quote like
[54:58] brother George Smith I was watching him
[55:00] uh he was down at brother Jason Watkins
[55:02] and Lord he pulled that stinking ruler
[55:04] out I mean that level and he laid it on
[55:06] the thing you know it's about this long
[55:08] cuz he preaches balance and he's you
[55:09] know what he's about the only one left
[55:11] this brother Jason was talking about
[55:12] he's about the only one left that was
[55:15] old enough to know brother brandham cuz
[55:18] remember he married his daughter but
[55:20] brother B Paul's gone Brother Joseph was
[55:21] a little bitty boy he was the only one
[55:24] of the only adult that really saw and
[55:26] and brother George told us many many
[55:27] times he said soon as brother Ram left
[55:29] the Earth he said those people were a
[55:30] bunch of quacks and they just started
[55:33] right and left started
[55:34] leaving why it was for us it was for the
[55:38] people that would listen to the voice of
[55:40] God not the voice of William brandom but
[55:43] the voice of God to me and you behold I
[55:46] sent you Elijah the prophet I didn't
[55:49] send him to the world I sent him to
[55:51] you and I rever that he's not my God but
[55:54] listen without brother random we'd be in
[55:56] deep
[55:59] trouble deep
[56:02] trouble what would we do drive a
[56:04] Chevrolet drive a Ford but we go
[56:06] somewhere else we be driving I think we
[56:07] need to go over this
[56:09] way that's why I'm sorry folks that you
[56:11] need leadership in the
[56:13] church why would you bring somebody like
[56:15] you watch a movie about Robert El Lee he
[56:17] comes up you know and he's got 50,000
[56:20] men out there in front of him getting
[56:21] ready to go to
[56:23] Gettysburg he's the captain
[56:25] they are
[56:26] going to battle knowing that probably
[56:30] 30% of them are not going to make it
[56:33] back and he knows that probably 30% of
[56:37] them is not going to make it back they
[56:40] actually were sewing their they sewed
[56:42] their names inside their coats in case
[56:44] they died they didn't know who they were
[56:46] because there's no such thing as a
[56:47] driver's license social security card
[56:48] and all that other stuff so if you died
[56:50] on the battlefield they had you had to
[56:52] to know your name there was no other
[56:53] registry maybe they had a registry in
[56:55] Washington or somewhere but here he is
[56:57] standing what if what if 10,000 said
[57:00] well now I think I'm going to go over
[57:01] here and me and and pick it we're going
[57:03] to go oh and we're going to go over this
[57:05] way and then Long Street says no no no
[57:08] no no no no don't listen to him we're
[57:10] going over this way well they really got
[57:12] their rear end beat they got it beat
[57:15] pretty bad anyway but there had to be
[57:18] one General and he know what he took the
[57:20] blame I love that part of the movie when
[57:22] they came back through the woods and and
[57:25] and Robert El Le is this he's just
[57:27] distraught he just knew he could go
[57:29] right through that right through that
[57:30] wedge of the front people of the of the
[57:34] north and he believed that cuz he sent
[57:37] people to their death but them guys come
[57:39] back and they didn't point up and say I
[57:41] told you this wasn't going to happen no
[57:44] they come back and said Captain give us
[57:46] one more time give us one more chance
[57:49] we'll go we'll go one more time now
[57:52] that's a real group of people amen
[57:55] that's a real group of people that
[57:56] believe so much in a cause do you
[57:59] believe so much in a cause today that
[58:00] you give your life for it I
[58:06] do so next day it's come there was an
[58:09] announcement in heaven same thing out of
[58:10] the mind of God comes a logos a sealed
[58:13] message is opened up a mystery is
[58:15] unfolded to the star of that age the
[58:17] messenger picks up the logos of God and
[58:18] what does he do he proclaims that
[58:20] message and then it takes a five-fold
[58:22] Ministry according to God according to
[58:24] the Bible it takes a five-fold Ministry
[58:26] to receive that from the messenger and
[58:29] break it down to the people not break it
[58:31] off
[58:34] amen break it down to the
[58:37] people Revelations 1 ver8 says I am
[58:40] Alpha and Oma the beginning and the
[58:41] ending sayith the Lord which is and
[58:43] which was and which is to come the
[58:45] almighty so the day of Pentecost started
[58:48] in 830 the day of Pentecost I like what
[58:51] brother Donnie Ragan said the other day
[58:52] he's kind preaching there's about four
[58:54] people preach preaching on the same
[58:55] thing of the early church and um he said
[58:58] now God didn't God didn't say well I'll
[59:01] just pour out the Holy Ghost any time he
[59:03] had a distinct time to do
[59:05] it now God said Jesus said go to
[59:08] Jerusalem till you be endued with power
[59:10] from on high amen right remember brother
[59:14] Brown said about 10 days into it or five
[59:16] days into it they're like I think we got
[59:18] it I think I think
[59:20] no no we don't have it cuz we still act
[59:23] the same way we did before
[59:26] for come on
[59:28] somebody that's how you know if you got
[59:30] it or don't got it so the day Pentecost
[59:33] Penta 50 days on the day of Pentecost
[59:36] there was a
[59:37] feast there was a feast of the Holy
[59:39] Ghost falling on 12 120 people and what
[59:42] a feast day that was there hadn't been a
[59:44] Pentecost since that but we're now
[59:46] living in that Pentecostal Feast so ad30
[59:50] now the church age didn't start till 856
[59:55] so there was a Pentecostal age or the
[59:58] beginning of the alpha Church in that
[1:00:01] called Ephesus but it began with a day
[1:00:04] of
[1:00:06] Pentecost then they took the message and
[1:00:09] I'll read it to you in just a little
[1:00:10] while where where Paul he he he says I
[1:00:13] should have been back there I was born
[1:00:16] out of due
[1:00:17] season brother R said the same identical
[1:00:20] thing 1950 on that movie that they made
[1:00:24] he said I was born out of due time to
[1:00:25] you Pentecostal people in other words I
[1:00:28] should have been born and been in your
[1:00:29] 1906 isua Street no he was just Desiring
[1:00:33] to be that way but that's not the way
[1:00:34] God wanted it all right so the alpha
[1:00:37] Church started with a day of Pentecost
[1:00:39] where the Holy Ghost fell no Messenger
[1:00:41] to the age the Holy Ghost fell Peter
[1:00:44] listen Peter was the spokesperson he
[1:00:46] wasn't the messenger right there's a
[1:00:49] difference everybody with me all right
[1:00:52] God didn't pick Peter he picked Saul but
[1:00:55] by the time he had Peter out here to
[1:00:57] have the keys to open up the door Saul
[1:00:59] was closing the door and killing
[1:01:03] him would you have picked
[1:01:06] him I didn't think
[1:01:08] so we would have probably pick
[1:01:12] Judas hello somebody I'll wake you up
[1:01:15] you say the word Judas and they
[1:01:17] go we would have pick Judas he was the
[1:01:20] Slick guy the guy that's always got the
[1:01:23] money here and he's always got this in
[1:01:25] control and that in
[1:01:27] anyway but here's Peter naked half the
[1:01:31] time
[1:01:33] cussing fighting cutting people's ears
[1:01:36] off lying to the Lord would you have
[1:01:39] pick him didn't think
[1:01:42] so I'm glad I'm not
[1:01:44] God cuz they were the perfect pick for
[1:01:47] the perfect time for the perfect AG that
[1:01:48] we're in cuz remember God don't make a
[1:01:52] mistake okay if he picked Peter to do
[1:01:55] what he did he picked Peter to open the
[1:01:57] door but he sent Paul to be the
[1:01:59] messenger to the church age all right
[1:02:01] and we'll look here right here now look
[1:02:03] on the day of Pentecost here in this age
[1:02:04] 1906a Street he did not pick a messenger
[1:02:08] he picked a
[1:02:09] spokesperson the one ey black
[1:02:12] man all right read read it read it it'll
[1:02:15] tell you he was the
[1:02:18] spearhead but he wasn't The Messengers
[1:02:20] of the age right the messenger of the
[1:02:22] age actually wasn't even born yet
[1:02:23] brother Ram was born in
[1:02:25] 1909 so see they started that isua
[1:02:28] street Mission with the oneeyed black
[1:02:29] man and then they continued on and then
[1:02:32] brother brandham was born and from 1909
[1:02:36] to
[1:02:37] 1947 we don't hear anything about
[1:02:39] brother brandham not much we know he
[1:02:42] preached some but we know one time for
[1:02:44] sure he told us and I thank God for a
[1:02:45] prophet that's honest enough to tell us
[1:02:48] that he waxed his car and washed it on
[1:02:52] Sunday and watched it them church people
[1:02:55] go to
[1:02:56] church but boy when the Holy Ghost got a
[1:02:59] hold of him he preached against them
[1:03:01] people that was washing their car not
[1:03:03] going to church but the day of Pentecost
[1:03:06] in our age though there was no messeng
[1:03:08] to the age we'll read that in in the uh
[1:03:10] Church in the seal book way away from
[1:03:13] now when we get to lay out of sea so the
[1:03:15] first AG the alpha age started with an
[1:03:17] day of Pentecost during the age of
[1:03:19] Pentecost with no messenger but a
[1:03:21] spokesperson all right then the
[1:03:23] messenger comes on the scen 1906 Isa
[1:03:25] Street the gifts come back the Holy
[1:03:27] Ghost fell in 1906 Isa Street and that
[1:03:30] if y'all don't know that that's in
[1:03:32] California started in the
[1:03:34] East ended up in the west and isusa
[1:03:38] Street do you know what that you know
[1:03:40] why they named it isusa
[1:03:43] street I'm not going to charge you for
[1:03:45] this
[1:03:47] one they had everything from A to Z in
[1:03:50] the
[1:03:50] USA come
[1:03:53] on
[1:03:55] ausa look it up they had everything from
[1:03:58] A to Z in the USA they had everything in
[1:04:01] the world out there cuz remember we
[1:04:03] started out here in the East and then it
[1:04:05] trickled went all the way to the west
[1:04:06] and then it stopped oh yeah there was a
[1:04:09] few went here and there but they it
[1:04:11] stopped on the on the west coast in
[1:04:13] theza Street on the mission the Holy
[1:04:15] Ghost fell on a bunch of
[1:04:18] trinitarians but he was pleased to dwell
[1:04:20] in them at the moment he was pleased for
[1:04:23] for bar and different ones to open up
[1:04:25] the word of God to the group of people
[1:04:27] that he had but the messenger of Malachi
[1:04:30] 4 was not on the scene yet cuz he was to
[1:04:32] turn the hearts of those people back to
[1:04:35] original Pentecost that we're talking
[1:04:38] about in ad30 everybody with
[1:04:41] me so the beginning and ending of the
[1:04:43] dispensation of the Gentiles started the
[1:04:46] same way it ended the same way all right
[1:04:48] it's ending up now with a Pentecostal
[1:04:51] blessing First Alpha
[1:04:54] Bride Comes in they they were bride but
[1:04:57] there was no messenger of the age then
[1:04:58] ad 56 Paul steps on the scene he's a
[1:05:01] messenger establishes um the Church of
[1:05:03] Ephesus brother BR said and that's our
[1:05:05] marker from 856 well brother Brown was
[1:05:07] born in 1909 1906 zuda Street Mission
[1:05:11] started they were trinitarians but God
[1:05:13] said I'm pleased to dwell in them I'm
[1:05:14] going to send the real true baptism of
[1:05:16] the Holy
[1:05:18] Ghost but that's not
[1:05:20] all I got to restore the gifts according
[1:05:23] to my I mean restore the word back
[1:05:25] according to Malachi 4 turn the hearts
[1:05:27] of the children those 1906 Babylon
[1:05:30] Pentecostal babies he was turning them
[1:05:32] back to the original faith of the
[1:05:34] Pentecostal fathers that had this
[1:05:36] working in their life and had this
[1:05:37] working in their
[1:05:38] church right everybody with me so you
[1:05:42] got the book ends he was both Alpha and
[1:05:45] Omega of course he was in between all
[1:05:48] the other letters but he specifically
[1:05:50] said Alpha and Omega he had a rainbow
[1:05:52] over his head which is covenant now if
[1:05:54] you notice the light now watch the light
[1:05:56] of
[1:05:57] Pentecost what did I just say there was
[1:05:59] a Pentecostal age over here right right
[1:06:02] there was a Pentecost age
[1:06:05] 1906 now if you notice the light of
[1:06:08] Pentecost where it started gradually
[1:06:11] smothered
[1:06:13] out H you've lost your first
[1:06:20] love these men ireneus polycarp all the
[1:06:22] rest of them sealed their testimony with
[1:06:24] their blood until it finally squeezed
[1:06:26] Christianity into the darkest of days
[1:06:30] Philadelphia and church age brother
[1:06:32] Brown said he had his hands out in the
[1:06:34] form of a cross I'm Alpha and Omega in
[1:06:36] other words I'll be Supreme in the first
[1:06:39] and I'll be Supreme in the last now what
[1:06:43] did he do in the first chapter of
[1:06:44] Revelations he revealed his Supreme
[1:06:46] deity to the first church in Ephesus is
[1:06:49] that right well now notice every one of
[1:06:51] these churches coming down through here
[1:06:54] he revealed himself in deity look only
[1:06:56] in his glorified
[1:06:59] form if you don't understand that I'm
[1:07:01] going to explain it to
[1:07:03] you he revealed his Supreme de the first
[1:07:06] church age had no problem with one
[1:07:10] God they knew who he was they knew who
[1:07:14] that he had all these compound names but
[1:07:16] he was that Jesus Christ that walk to
[1:07:18] the Earth they didn't have a problem
[1:07:20] with that until people like sthus and
[1:07:22] different ones got sitting around going
[1:07:24] well you know I saw him cry I saw him he
[1:07:26] had to go to the bathroom he can't be
[1:07:27] God uh maybe he's just a like person of
[1:07:30] God maybe he's kind of a little bit like
[1:07:31] oh he's his
[1:07:32] son so now let's split him now he said
[1:07:35] I'm going to send the Holy Ghost back so
[1:07:36] now let's give us another person over
[1:07:37] here do you understand you see how that
[1:07:39] see how easy that would be but now
[1:07:42] remember he revealed himself in his
[1:07:44] deity on his glorified form down through
[1:07:46] the other ages because they believed the
[1:07:48] father son Holy Ghost Doctrine but now
[1:07:51] remember if they didn't believe it
[1:07:54] we had to be restored too right the
[1:07:57] Omega bride had to come back to where
[1:07:59] your first seal and your first three
[1:08:01] Church ages correlate with each other
[1:08:04] because of what's the first
[1:08:05] seal the mystery of iniquity what that
[1:08:09] God's not three he's
[1:08:11] one same thing in the church age one God
[1:08:14] so it had to be restored back here so
[1:08:15] the first seal when it opened it wasn't
[1:08:17] that that rider was riding off and this
[1:08:19] is this and this is that no there was
[1:08:21] two the two forces right
[1:08:24] brother Bram said here stands the Lamb
[1:08:25] with his book in hand there goes a wy's
[1:08:27] riter in other words if you got two
[1:08:29] people on the scene one's got to be God
[1:08:31] the other one's got to be the devil
[1:08:33] there's only two Powers one's permitted
[1:08:35] and one's the big man all right so
[1:08:39] everybody had a little bit of Revelation
[1:08:41] but on this last one he becomes Z back
[1:08:44] to the original beginning again the
[1:08:47] first and the last the first age now the
[1:08:50] last age priest said I am the first and
[1:08:52] the last and then the Masterpiece we
[1:08:54] talked about the other day the seed is
[1:08:56] back to its original condition listen
[1:08:59] that's
[1:09:00] us there's no life in the shook anymore
[1:09:03] there's no life in the stock anymore the
[1:09:06] life is only in the seed
[1:09:08] right and the seed's the word of God and
[1:09:12] must have all the word in order to be
[1:09:14] seed now you can't have half a seed it
[1:09:16] won't grow right you can't cut a seed in
[1:09:19] half and plant it yeah you can plant it
[1:09:21] you won't get anything the word has
[1:09:24] become flesh exactly like he promised in
[1:09:26] Luke 17 Malachi 4 and all these others a
[1:09:29] true life that all true life that was in
[1:09:32] the stock tassel and husk Luther Wesley
[1:09:34] and Pentecost was true they was true
[1:09:36] Holy Ghost they were True Believers in
[1:09:38] their
[1:09:40] age ready for the resurrection ready for
[1:09:42] the Harvest This Is Us is now gathering
[1:09:44] in the seed the alpha has become Omega
[1:09:48] amen the first come last and the last is
[1:09:50] first the seed that went in has come
[1:09:52] through a process says and become the
[1:09:55] seed again that's me and you the seed
[1:09:57] that fell in the Garden of Eden and died
[1:09:59] there come back for that imperfect seed
[1:10:02] that died there comes to the perfect
[1:10:04] seed the second Adam which is Jesus
[1:10:06] Christ which was not born of a natural
[1:10:09] seed he born of a spiritual seed a
[1:10:11] creation of God the first Ministry and
[1:10:14] the last Ministry is the same the first
[1:10:17] message and the last message is the same
[1:10:20] I was in Alpha I'm in Omega there'll be
[1:10:22] a day that won't be called day or night
[1:10:23] but in the evening time that's where
[1:10:25] we're at it shall be light see Alpha and
[1:10:27] Omega has become the first and the last
[1:10:30] did everybody understand
[1:10:31] that because it proved its point right
[1:10:33] here when brother rown saw the vision of
[1:10:36] the church and the bride remember the
[1:10:37] bride comes into
[1:10:39] view beautiful of all Nations they're
[1:10:42] dressed right they go off the scene then
[1:10:44] here comes the American
[1:10:46] Church naked twisting everything going
[1:10:49] in every different direction if you know
[1:10:51] what I mean he was ashamed of it he
[1:10:53] turned turned away from it he said oh is
[1:10:55] this all I produced and the angel said
[1:10:57] no no no don't don't worry Here Comes
[1:10:59] Your
[1:11:01] group amen you know you and I were in
[1:11:04] that
[1:11:05] group spiritually we were in that group
[1:11:09] but the Bride come into view twice so it
[1:11:11] was one time then the church and then
[1:11:13] the bride comes into view again the seed
[1:11:15] fell in the ground at Nia and it had to
[1:11:17] come up that's why brother Brandon
[1:11:19] preaching the spoken words Original Seed
[1:11:21] I believe he really what his message was
[1:11:25] I mean yeah he did down through he would
[1:11:27] hit not hit and miss IND Doctrine but he
[1:11:29] he'd Proclaim something and then say
[1:11:31] well but boy when he come to spoke
[1:11:33] Original Seed he said look it's come
[1:11:35] back to grain
[1:11:36] now this is grain we're talking about
[1:11:39] here this ain't no stock this ain't no
[1:11:40] shook this is grain and then when God
[1:11:44] told him said pick up your pen and write
[1:11:46] man he poured it on yes sir and I'm sure
[1:11:49] people left him then listen that's the
[1:11:52] only reason she was in view reviewed the
[1:11:54] second time she was reviewed the first
[1:11:55] time then she was reviewed the second
[1:11:58] time and she is perfectly the second
[1:12:00] time like she was the first
[1:12:02] time Revelations 2 vers1 to the angel of
[1:12:05] the Church of Ephesus write these things
[1:12:07] which sayith he that holdeth the Seven
[1:12:09] Stars and his right hand who walketh in
[1:12:11] the midst of the seven golden
[1:12:13] candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy
[1:12:15] labor listen God knows everything and
[1:12:17] thy patience and how thou cast not bear
[1:12:19] them which are
[1:12:22] evil right
[1:12:25] and thou H has tried them which say they
[1:12:27] are Apostles and are not and H has found
[1:12:29] them Liars amen wow and has borne and
[1:12:34] has patience and for my name's sake has
[1:12:36] labored and not fainted nevertheless I
[1:12:38] have somewhat against thee because thou
[1:12:40] Hast left thy First Love remember
[1:12:43] therefore from when thou art fallen in
[1:12:44] other words remember
[1:12:47] Pentecost remember when I fell on a
[1:12:49] group of people that were scared to
[1:12:50] death and those people came out and and
[1:12:53] by this time he wrote this they've all
[1:12:55] died except John every one of them had
[1:12:58] died except
[1:13:00] John remember from when thou are fallen
[1:13:03] and repent do the first words go back do
[1:13:05] the first words or else I'll come unto
[1:13:07] thee quickly and remove thy Candlestick
[1:13:09] out of his place except thou repent but
[1:13:12] this thou Hast that thou hatest the
[1:13:14] Deeds of the nicians which I also hate
[1:13:17] yes Believers God
[1:13:20] hates cuz he said he did ever tell you
[1:13:23] God don't make a mistake okay so God
[1:13:26] don't make a mistake if he wrote this
[1:13:27] right here and said I hate him too then
[1:13:30] that's something he hates he hates the
[1:13:32] Deeds of the nicians which is people as
[1:13:36] the Catholic church has done has
[1:13:37] conquered the leoty and give them no
[1:13:39] voice no power nothing all right they
[1:13:42] may have been identified identical with
[1:13:45] those who held the doctrine of balum and
[1:13:47] I told you about a hirling prophet and
[1:13:49] all those different things we praise God
[1:13:50] we know that brother Ram come back and
[1:13:52] he he did as he Elijah did in at Mount
[1:13:55] Carmel excuse me he put everything back
[1:13:58] together he put everything He restored
[1:14:01] the the rocks on the altar He restored
[1:14:04] worship He restored everything as Elijah
[1:14:07] did there on the
[1:14:11] mountain so God hates that he hates
[1:14:22] ncismelanie and is not for you to know
[1:14:24] the times of the seasons which the
[1:14:25] father hath put in his own power this is
[1:14:27] Jesus talking is in red letter not me
[1:14:29] putting it in there that's red letter
[1:14:31] but you shall receive power after that
[1:14:33] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[1:14:35] shall be witnesses to Jerusalem Judea
[1:14:37] Samaria and Lula
[1:14:40] Georgia can somebody say praise
[1:14:43] God he was thinking of me when he was
[1:14:46] saying that I hope he's thinking to you
[1:14:48] yes sir I'm going to send I'm going to
[1:14:50] send up there the Holy Ghost to that
[1:14:52] group of people
[1:14:53] and I'm going to burst some
[1:14:56] children and when he had spoken these
[1:14:58] things while they beheld he was taken up
[1:15:00] and a cloud received in my other sight
[1:15:02] listen that's why people hate the cloud
[1:15:03] in the end time they hate that
[1:15:06] thing
[1:15:09] amen cuz he left in the
[1:15:13] cloud he's coming back in the
[1:15:16] cloud and a cloud received him out of
[1:15:18] their sight while they looked
[1:15:19] steadfastly toward heaven in other words
[1:15:20] they were going where'd he go what
[1:15:22] happened I thought he was going to rest
[1:15:23] Jerusalem every kept they kept asking
[1:15:25] they had no Revelation are you going to
[1:15:27] restore Israel at this time are you
[1:15:28] going to fight our battles for us are
[1:15:29] you going to like take that big old
[1:15:30] spear you're talking about run it
[1:15:32] through them 10,000 Romans that are
[1:15:33] persecuting us and we're just going to
[1:15:35] have a an absolute
[1:15:37] Millennium that's what they were
[1:15:38] believing that's why a lot of people
[1:15:40] didn't believe listen he was seen a 500
[1:15:43] people after his resurrection a
[1:15:46] glorified Jesus walked on the Earth 500
[1:15:49] people saw him and only 120 made it to
[1:15:52] the upper room where the other 380
[1:15:56] go well maybe not oh he really wasn't a
[1:16:00] prophet oh oh no that message I can't
[1:16:02] believe that you know I'm going go back
[1:16:04] over here where I was at
[1:16:06] M you men of Galilee other words there
[1:16:09] was two men stood in white apparel why
[1:16:12] are you gazing up into heaven this same
[1:16:14] Jesus which is taken up from you into
[1:16:15] heaven so shall come in light manner as
[1:16:18] you have seen him go into heaven and we
[1:16:20] know in 1963 he did not physically come
[1:16:23] back I want y'all to understand that
[1:16:25] when we say he came back 1963 he came
[1:16:27] back in word form in his bride in the
[1:16:30] fullness of the godhead bodily in The
[1:16:33] Headstone not his personal being
[1:16:36] everybody with me his personal being
[1:16:39] will not return and put his feet on this
[1:16:41] Earth till the Millennium so we got a
[1:16:42] little time remember we meet him in the
[1:16:47] air praise God for a
[1:16:49] prophet Luke 24:46 he said unto them
[1:16:53] thus it is written and thus it behooved
[1:16:55] Christ to suffer and rise from the dead
[1:16:56] the third day this is Jesus talking and
[1:16:59] that repentance and remission of sin
[1:17:01] should be preached in his name among all
[1:17:03] nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye
[1:17:05] are witnesses of these things and behold
[1:17:07] I send the promise of my father upon you
[1:17:12] but car ye in the city of Jerusalem till
[1:17:13] you be endued with power from on high
[1:17:16] what's you talking about what is the
[1:17:19] promise of the father it's a promise of
[1:17:22] the Holy Ghost
[1:17:23] to come back in a group of people and be
[1:17:26] the Holy Ghost dispensation down through
[1:17:28] the church ages everybody with me say
[1:17:30] Amen the Son of God dispensation listen
[1:17:33] Jesus is not on his throne right
[1:17:38] now remember everybody saw him standing
[1:17:40] on the right hand of the
[1:17:42] father standing making
[1:17:46] intercession but one day he's going to
[1:17:47] sit
[1:17:50] down but not until he makes his enemies
[1:17:53] his foot
[1:17:54] stol not until we get to the Millennium
[1:17:57] when he becomes in dispensation he'll
[1:18:00] become the son of David and he'll sit
[1:18:02] down on his own throne but the father's
[1:18:05] Throne is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:08] that's why I totally disagree with the
[1:18:09] people that say well I'm not taking
[1:18:11] communion because Christ come in
[1:18:14] 1963 and we don't have to take it
[1:18:17] anymore well I got something for him
[1:18:19] Jesus told him said I'll not drink this
[1:18:22] with you till I come in my father's
[1:18:23] Kingdom well when did his father's
[1:18:24] Kingdom
[1:18:25] Come just a few days later on the day of
[1:18:28] Pentecost that's why the book of Acts is
[1:18:31] full of people going to
[1:18:35] church and taking
[1:18:38] communion listen if it's good enough for
[1:18:41] them good enough for
[1:18:43] me I'd be lary of any doctrine that
[1:18:46] takes stuff out of the
[1:18:47] Bible sorry I
[1:18:50] would CU Revelations over there in about
[1:18:53] 20s something over there said something
[1:18:54] about plagues and names took out and
[1:18:59] yeah let's just leave it like it is
[1:19:02] Jesus said do this till I come that's
[1:19:04] right all right and I believe he meant
[1:19:05] physical form okay everybody with me
[1:19:08] because he did not come in 1963 in
[1:19:10] physical form so he could take communion
[1:19:12] with
[1:19:13] us he came in spiritual form and the
[1:19:15] opening of the word to open the complete
[1:19:17] word of God The Headstone came back what
[1:19:20] to the church to the bride to the El
[1:19:24] lady he's at me and you now doing the
[1:19:29] work now his body when nail scars in it
[1:19:32] has not come back
[1:19:33] yet is sitting at the right hand of God
[1:19:36] he says sitting but he's standing he's
[1:19:38] sitting on the father's Throne now which
[1:19:39] now look but when he comes back he's
[1:19:41] going to sit on his own Throne the
[1:19:42] Throne of David look that he
[1:19:46] inherited that's when he comes in
[1:19:48] physical form but see he's here now in
[1:19:50] spiritual form working through your body
[1:19:52] and my body body all right everybody
[1:19:54] with me the breach it comes from the
[1:19:56] father's Throne where he has been seated
[1:19:58] now he is Seated on the father's throne
[1:20:00] in your heart where's the father's
[1:20:02] Throne at the moment it's in your
[1:20:05] heart where he had been seated since he
[1:20:08] had been slain and raised again he
[1:20:10] raised up and sat on the right hand of
[1:20:12] God look making intercession who is
[1:20:16] that that's Jesus Christ in intercessory
[1:20:19] form called the Holy Ghost that's why so
[1:20:22] important for you to have the Holy
[1:20:26] Ghost Acts 2 verse1 when the day of
[1:20:29] Pentecost was fully come they were with
[1:20:31] one mind and one Accord in one place
[1:20:33] praise
[1:20:35] God they might have drove Chevrolets and
[1:20:38] fors a few backslid Toyotas where
[1:20:42] Danny and backslid
[1:20:44] Nissan but they came for one thing God
[1:20:48] told him to go somewhere and wait to be
[1:20:51] endued with what power power that you
[1:20:54] had never had
[1:20:56] before receive the Holy Ghost today
[1:20:58] folks it'll be a power you've never had
[1:21:01] before Oh I it looks so bad it looks so
[1:21:04] weak you're not looking at the right
[1:21:07] Jesus he never ever fails it's like
[1:21:11] brother Ron said said I ain't never seen
[1:21:13] him lose
[1:21:16] one he enters into a battle never is
[1:21:20] there any odds of him losing right he
[1:21:23] wins every time so let's let him fight
[1:21:26] our battles enter in with him and let
[1:21:27] him fight for us and suddenly there came
[1:21:30] a sound from Heaven as of a rushing
[1:21:31] Mighty Wind and it filled all the house
[1:21:33] where they were sitting they appeared on
[1:21:35] them clothing tongues like a fire do
[1:21:37] y'all remember that tape there's a tape
[1:21:38] somewhere I know maybe probably sister C
[1:21:40] knows that where there's a tape where
[1:21:41] brother brandham when he's up he's
[1:21:43] getting ready to to end the service and
[1:21:45] you hear
[1:21:48] this he said that was the same thing he
[1:21:51] said it's the Holy Ghost ghost coming
[1:21:53] into the room oh praise God I I pray
[1:21:55] that if it don't ever happen here that's
[1:21:57] okay but I sure would love for it to
[1:21:59] happen and they were all filled well if
[1:22:02] you desire listen if that's the desire
[1:22:03] of your heart if you're if you're
[1:22:04] ashamed of it you'll never see
[1:22:07] it and they were all filled with the
[1:22:09] Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:22:10] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:22:11] utterance and there was dwelling at
[1:22:13] Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every
[1:22:15] nation under heaven now what' they say
[1:22:17] they said how is this miracle that we're
[1:22:19] listening to every man and we're hearing
[1:22:21] him in our own language
[1:22:23] that's where the Pentecostals got him
[1:22:25] wrong tongues is the evidence no tongues
[1:22:28] is not the evidence listening is the
[1:22:31] evidence faith comes by hearing not by
[1:22:33] speaking in tongues they heard everyone
[1:22:36] that was the mystery that they heard
[1:22:37] them all in their language so Pentecost
[1:22:41] means 50 we know
[1:22:43] that keep going now this
[1:22:45] is Peter with the
[1:22:49] keys got the keys in his hand so
[1:22:51] whatever he unlocks down here is God's
[1:22:52] got to unlock up there now when they
[1:22:54] heard this they were pricked in the
[1:22:56] heart and said un Peter and the rest of
[1:22:57] the Apostles men and Brethren what shall
[1:22:59] we do then Peter said unto them repent
[1:23:02] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:23:03] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:23:05] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[1:23:07] of the
[1:23:09] Father the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:23:12] that promise is unto you and to your
[1:23:14] children all that are far off even as
[1:23:16] many as the Lord Our God shall call and
[1:23:19] with many other words he did testify and
[1:23:21] exhort saying save yourself from this
[1:23:23] wicked or untoward generation they don't
[1:23:26] even know anything about
[1:23:28] Wicked according to
[1:23:31] us then they gladly received his word
[1:23:34] they were
[1:23:37] baptized and brother George Smith you
[1:23:39] know he knows about Jerusalem he knows
[1:23:41] everything he said now where they had
[1:23:42] this upper room he said it was about a
[1:23:44] 100 miles from the nearest
[1:23:47] water he said I'd like to ask Peter
[1:23:49] where he baptized 3,000 people and it
[1:23:52] wasn't a water hole nearby I think God
[1:23:54] may have just created
[1:23:56] one gave them a flood and said here
[1:23:58] baptize these 3,000 people we can't go
[1:24:00] 100 miles you baptize them right
[1:24:03] here y'all going to understand that when
[1:24:05] we get in the glor get to glory and we
[1:24:07] look at those people that Liv in the
[1:24:08] book of Acts there's going to be more
[1:24:10] miracles That Never Was Written that
[1:24:11] you're going to go
[1:24:13] wow that happened under the power of the
[1:24:16] first church and you know what they're
[1:24:17] going to look at us and say hey what
[1:24:19] happened in your age we barely made it
[1:24:24] but we watched you
[1:24:27] guys we watched the Holy Ghost fall on
[1:24:29] the original Believers and we became
[1:24:32] that we didn't copy it Satan's a copier
[1:24:36] no the same holy ghost that fell there
[1:24:38] we realize it fell on us right but but
[1:24:42] your age was wicked hey everybody's
[1:24:45] dealt their age we were number seven but
[1:24:49] God put every one of us in an age that
[1:24:51] we can make make it and overcome so
[1:24:55] you're in the age of the
[1:24:56] Overcomer in your age The Darkest Hour
[1:25:00] you'll ever see on the face of the earth
[1:25:01] is right now but it's the most glorious
[1:25:03] time to be here we're going home this is
[1:25:06] not this is not your
[1:25:10] house then they gladly received his word
[1:25:12] were baptized the same day and added
[1:25:14] 3,000 souls and look and they continued
[1:25:18] steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and
[1:25:21] fellowship y boy if we could do that in
[1:25:24] a
[1:25:26] message you know if you get two
[1:25:28] preachers in a room there's three
[1:25:30] opinions and they continue steadfastly
[1:25:33] in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship
[1:25:36] that was an old thing that come from
[1:25:37] beekeepers they said if you if you ask
[1:25:39] 10 beekeepers uh one question you get 11
[1:25:41] different
[1:25:43] answers and they contined steadfastly in
[1:25:45] Apostles Doctrine in fellowship and in
[1:25:47] Breaking of bread and in prayer they
[1:25:50] took
[1:25:51] communion
[1:25:53] I'm bring something out maybe later
[1:25:57] on make it a little bit solemn for right
[1:25:59] now but if it happened then it's going
[1:26:01] to happen
[1:26:02] now brother Ram said there was an anany
[1:26:05] and saf Fire Spirit in that age there
[1:26:07] going to be one in this age that's right
[1:26:10] amen you know I got a revelation today
[1:26:12] brother
[1:26:13] Bob after you walked out of the room for
[1:26:16] some silly reason I did do you
[1:26:20] know if they were on if they were like
[1:26:23] they they had all things common right
[1:26:25] everybody with me the reason anas and
[1:26:28] Safara got
[1:26:29] killed by God was that they withheld
[1:26:33] some of their money that they had
[1:26:36] pledged
[1:26:38] right what if they missed the church
[1:26:40] service that Peter said you got to give
[1:26:41] it
[1:26:47] all there's a day of visitation and if
[1:26:49] you miss it it's your fault right God's
[1:26:52] here every
[1:26:54] service what if ananas heard this great
[1:26:57] sermon by Peter that says Oh we must
[1:26:59] give all and and and and stopped his
[1:27:02] sermon right there and then the next
[1:27:03] week Ann and sa fire went out tried to
[1:27:05] make some more money that's a man and a
[1:27:07] woman if y'all don't know that that's
[1:27:08] some husband and wife and they went out
[1:27:10] to make some more money and so Peter has
[1:27:12] another sermon the next the next uh
[1:27:14] Sunday and he says now if you
[1:27:19] withhold you've done it against the Holy
[1:27:21] Ghost you've done it against me cuz
[1:27:23] remember he told him specifically he
[1:27:25] said you didn't lie to me you lied to
[1:27:28] the Holy Ghost and an I fell over dead
[1:27:30] and you know what they took him out and
[1:27:32] buried him his wife walks in they must
[1:27:34] not have communicated very well and she
[1:27:37] said the same thing so they were both in
[1:27:39] the same boat but just be
[1:27:42] careful if there's one there brother R
[1:27:44] said there's one coming here and that's
[1:27:46] lying to the Holy
[1:27:49] Ghost remember the Bible tells us that
[1:27:51] they'll come a day when the The Sinner
[1:27:53] won't be able to sit in the congregation
[1:27:54] of the
[1:27:57] righteous folks God's going to weed the
[1:28:00] weeds out we don't judge who the weeds
[1:28:04] are we preach the
[1:28:06] gospel he's a one he's the one that
[1:28:12] separates the
[1:28:13] tears from the wheat all right but
[1:28:16] remember what what what God say let them
[1:28:18] grow though let them grow so we can tell
[1:28:20] the difference cuz listen one's going to
[1:28:23] grow this way one's going to grow this
[1:28:24] way I'm sorry God is a segregationist I
[1:28:27] am sorry brother Brown said he was and
[1:28:29] God said he was I hate that
[1:28:31] thing will you do you go somewhere that
[1:28:33] you
[1:28:34] hate I hope you don't hate us I hope he
[1:28:38] loves us he loves everybody but you and
[1:28:41] I make the choice whether to be one or
[1:28:42] the
[1:28:44] other everybody all
[1:28:46] right Peter on before the day of
[1:28:48] Pentecost was given the keys to the
[1:28:49] kingdom we find out that he opened it to
[1:28:52] the Jews on the day of Pentecost so he
[1:28:54] opened the door he was a spokesperson as
[1:28:56] as the oneeyed black man I'm trying to
[1:28:58] think of his name um
[1:29:01] param daddy Seymour all right opened the
[1:29:04] door but he wasn't the spokes I mean he
[1:29:06] was a spokesman but he wasn't a
[1:29:08] prophet we had to have a res praise God
[1:29:11] that just hit me we had to have a
[1:29:13] restoration Prophet on the scene he
[1:29:15] didn't restore he just brought the gifts
[1:29:18] back but they still were trinitarian God
[1:29:20] hated that
[1:29:22] right when they preach that God had to
[1:29:25] go with brother R
[1:29:29] coming he hates false Doctrine right but
[1:29:33] he's so gracious and so merciful to take
[1:29:36] the part that they were supposed to play
[1:29:39] and he said I'm pleased to dwell in that
[1:29:41] group of people right listen daddy seyar
[1:29:45] will and is in that sixth
[1:29:48] Dimension he's waiting on me and youly
[1:29:52] right he not
[1:29:55] lost no
[1:29:57] way I believe that he was a born again
[1:30:00] Christian that's right but he was in
[1:30:02] that Pentecostal age that didn't have a
[1:30:06] messenger but we got a
[1:30:08] messenger in this age
[1:30:12] yes and the final voice to the final age
[1:30:15] under her messenger is sitting here
[1:30:17] today that's right so Peter was a
[1:30:20] spokesperson he opened to the Jews
[1:30:22] waiting on
[1:30:24] Paul as brother Brown said a little
[1:30:26] short stooped over hook
[1:30:30] nose high-tempered
[1:30:33] Jew that's pretty much a direct
[1:30:38] quote would you have picked
[1:30:41] him no you wouldn't have Hey listen they
[1:30:44] ran from
[1:30:45] him could you imagine the first time
[1:30:47] Paul steps out and says hey ho hey come
[1:30:50] back come back come back I'm not here to
[1:30:51] kill you
[1:30:54] but what did the Holy Ghost do those
[1:30:56] people that he persecuted had the Holy
[1:30:57] Ghost everybody with
[1:30:58] me and when he got the Holy
[1:31:01] Ghost it brought them together right it
[1:31:05] did not separate them we ought to put
[1:31:07] that in there mouth and chew on that for
[1:31:10] a little while the hly if you got the
[1:31:12] Holy Ghost and I got the Holy
[1:31:13] Ghost whether you drive a forward or
[1:31:15] chevolet right doesn't matter it brings
[1:31:18] us together under the word of God Amen
[1:31:21] so it brought them together under the
[1:31:23] word of God Paul he took what brought
[1:31:26] the logos of God he brought it to the
[1:31:28] people and the people that had listen he
[1:31:30] was preaching to people a lot of times
[1:31:32] that that had the Holy Ghost
[1:31:35] already they got it in ad30 he start
[1:31:38] preaching
[1:31:38] 056 they had established a couple of
[1:31:41] churches maybe between now and then
[1:31:43] between 830 and 56 but then there was a
[1:31:45] group of people that he come to that had
[1:31:47] never even heard of the Holy Ghost oh
[1:31:50] praise God then they got
[1:31:54] it so then they sent up for him they had
[1:31:56] the keys and he laid his hands on
[1:31:57] talking about Peter Acts 2 verse 46 and
[1:32:01] they continually daily with one Accord
[1:32:04] in the
[1:32:06] church we can't make it without each
[1:32:10] other we are
[1:32:15] sheep and he's a
[1:32:20] wolf and we have a great Shepherd amen
[1:32:24] that keeps a sheep that's right and they
[1:32:27] continuing daily with one Accord in the
[1:32:29] temple and breaking bread from house to
[1:32:32] house did eat their meat with
[1:32:38] gladness and singleness of
[1:32:43] heart now that doesn't
[1:32:46] mean that Peter ate chicken and the rest
[1:32:49] of them ate chicken because Peter did
[1:32:55] but they had one singleness in
[1:32:58] heart what is the heart the Holy Ghost
[1:33:01] that's the inner that's the soul of you
[1:33:03] cuz remember we're going to get to a
[1:33:04] part here people where where where Paul
[1:33:07] now the Bible specifically tells us
[1:33:09] Barnabas full of the Holy
[1:33:14] Ghost powerful man in the
[1:33:17] Bible Paul Church age messenger
[1:33:20] obviously full of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:22] they get together and they do some work
[1:33:24] but all of a
[1:33:26] sudden they have a little difference of
[1:33:28] opinion right one goes one way one goes
[1:33:32] the other way you don't hear Barnabas no
[1:33:33] more and you hear
[1:33:35] Paul now was Barnabas lost or back SL
[1:33:39] no one drove a chevet and one drove a
[1:33:42] Ford but Barnabas didn't deny the word
[1:33:44] of God because he had a word of God
[1:33:46] inside of him what am I telling you we
[1:33:48] may have our
[1:33:50] differences but we need to be
[1:33:52] singleness inside of oursel in one
[1:33:55] heart I want to see this church full of
[1:33:58] Holy Ghost fill people not just people
[1:34:02] and then I want that Holy Ghost to
[1:34:04] mature into a statue of a perfect man to
[1:34:08] where we don't have to listen we don't
[1:34:10] have to call the preacher find him every
[1:34:13] time you got a toothache Lay Your Hands
[1:34:15] on the sick lay your hands on your
[1:34:19] children Hannah is not going listen to
[1:34:22] this but she's fixing to have some hands
[1:34:23] laid on her I'm tired of her being tired
[1:34:27] I'm tired of me being tired of her and I
[1:34:29] ain't tired of her because you know what
[1:34:30] I
[1:34:33] mean but I don't touch her
[1:34:35] much you may think it's a
[1:34:38] silly but how many times have
[1:34:41] you we won't even get to Paul we'll get
[1:34:43] to him next week how many times of you
[1:34:46] told Brother Dale that your back
[1:34:49] hurt or your shoulder hurting
[1:34:52] right and sometime during the day he can
[1:34:55] bring you up here and Shake you and
[1:34:56] throw all all over you right right he
[1:34:59] said God bless you brother good to see
[1:35:01] you you know what he's doing he's making
[1:35:03] a
[1:35:05] contact and he's praying in his
[1:35:08] heart for that shoulder without him
[1:35:10] going oh bless God he's going to be
[1:35:12] healed because I prayed for him God you
[1:35:14] feel that brother no he probably didn't
[1:35:17] feel a thing but you know
[1:35:20] what most of the
[1:35:23] time it went
[1:35:25] away sister Gail she's she's probably
[1:35:28] watching online now she same thing I was
[1:35:29] preaching one time this been 10 more
[1:35:31] years
[1:35:32] ago and I saw her kind of sitting cockey
[1:35:35] over in her seat over there she finally
[1:35:37] straightened up and she just raised her
[1:35:39] hand and you know silently I thought
[1:35:42] well okay what had happened was she had
[1:35:45] a back a she couldn't she couldn't
[1:35:46] hardly bend over she you know how you
[1:35:47] get when you get a back eight you either
[1:35:49] like this or you over like this and she
[1:35:51] said she said I just believe what that
[1:35:52] man
[1:35:53] said right I believe what brother W said
[1:35:57] didn't I mean we was from here to to
[1:35:59] where Sister Mary sitting now where her
[1:36:01] and Dick used to sit healed just like
[1:36:04] that that's what a mature church I'm
[1:36:07] talking about you I ain't talking about
[1:36:08] me I'm talking about you a mature
[1:36:11] church should be run if you want to say
[1:36:14] that God runs his business different
[1:36:17] than we
[1:36:18] do but he gives us his business
[1:36:22] that he runs right
[1:36:24] here and this is the
[1:36:27] Playbook this is the whole thing don't
[1:36:30] need another opinion this is it right
[1:36:32] here cuz remember the Pentecostal they
[1:36:36] always now Jamaica boy was over in
[1:36:38] Jamaica and they was you know W this
[1:36:40] place that Daddy was preaching out they
[1:36:42] weren't they weren't message Believers
[1:36:43] but brother Keith had um brother SCS and
[1:36:46] him had been friends so Daddy went and
[1:36:47] preached a wonderful week of messages on
[1:36:50] Oneness and uh oh they were trying to
[1:36:53] get them to speak in tongues
[1:36:55] they and then they shake them and then
[1:36:57] and Daddy's over there he's dealing with
[1:36:59] a couple of people he just dealing with
[1:37:00] them dealing with them silently dealing
[1:37:03] with them when the service was over and
[1:37:06] everything got quiet
[1:37:08] down they had a guy up there his name
[1:37:10] was Clark and he's big he was bigger
[1:37:12] than Michael and had a wingspan of
[1:37:15] several feet big old black guy and they
[1:37:19] called him the prophet Prophet Clark
[1:37:22] he stands
[1:37:23] up he says oh deep voice I mean man
[1:37:26] you're
[1:37:27] like he said I want to tell y'all
[1:37:30] something he said I've watched all
[1:37:34] week y'all trying to get people to get
[1:37:37] the Holy Ghost by beating them on the
[1:37:41] back of course they're like they're all
[1:37:44] like he's a prophet we consider him
[1:37:46] maybe not
[1:37:48] anymore he turned around he said Daddy
[1:37:50] was sitting over there he said but that
[1:37:52] man right there has been telling us the
[1:37:55] truth all week never had to lay his
[1:37:58] hands on anybody never had to slap
[1:37:59] anybody or beat him on the
[1:38:01] back in other words he said that man's
[1:38:03] been telling he took that finger and it
[1:38:05] looked like it went all the way to
[1:38:05] Daddy's nose he was he was 20t away but
[1:38:08] he was like that man told us the truth
[1:38:11] all week and I watched him tonight and
[1:38:14] that's the right way to do it and boy
[1:38:16] they a get no clapping either it was
[1:38:17] just like dead
[1:38:19] silence cuz I mean they've been Ian they
[1:38:21] really because we sit in the back me and
[1:38:23] brother Harris was stood we actually we
[1:38:24] stood in the window looking in they was
[1:38:26] so packed full of people and they would
[1:38:28] try to get them to speak in tongues and
[1:38:29] they go and you could hear them well all
[1:38:32] they was doing was that was
[1:38:35] it and I don't say they wasn't any God
[1:38:37] in there but that's not a way to get God
[1:38:39] into somebody right and that's what
[1:38:41] brother Ram tried to explain and they
[1:38:43] got mad at him because see most of the
[1:38:45] people in that church based their whole
[1:38:48] Christian experience on that thing right
[1:38:50] there and beat him on the back take him
[1:38:54] in the
[1:38:55] room no you just deal with them Jesus
[1:38:59] never dealt with anybody that way he
[1:39:01] dealt with them quietly unless he was
[1:39:03] dealing with the devil but he still told
[1:39:04] the devil he said go just go but look
[1:39:08] right here this is the
[1:39:11] people of that age they continued daily
[1:39:14] with one according to Temple breaking
[1:39:15] bread from house to house they did eat
[1:39:17] their meat with gladness and singleness
[1:39:19] of heart praising God and having favor
[1:39:22] with
[1:39:22] all the people and the Lord added to the
[1:39:26] church daily as should be
[1:39:30] saved we know what Peter did Peter said
[1:39:33] Silver and Gold Have I None but such as
[1:39:34] I have give thee in the name of Jesus
[1:39:38] rise up and walk and he took him by the
[1:39:41] right hand and lifted him up and
[1:39:42] immediately his feet and ankle bones
[1:39:44] receive
[1:39:46] strength acts
[1:39:49] 7:57 here's where all comes into
[1:39:52] view where they they Steven got him so
[1:39:56] upset they stopped their ears and ran
[1:39:58] after him and cast him out of the city
[1:40:00] and stoned him and the witnesses laid
[1:40:02] down their clothes at a young man's feet
[1:40:03] whose name was
[1:40:06] Saul we've all been
[1:40:08] Saul but he had a name
[1:40:12] change and they stoned Steven calling
[1:40:14] upon God saying Lord Jesus receive my
[1:40:16] spirit and he kneeled down and cried
[1:40:18] with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin
[1:40:21] what a
[1:40:23] Christian listen it wasn't a sorry to be
[1:40:26] graphic it wasn't a you're
[1:40:28] dead they stoned him with stones that
[1:40:30] means they kept hitting him in the head
[1:40:32] and in the back and in the arm until he
[1:40:34] died they bludgeoned him to death and it
[1:40:37] was a slow agonizing death but he looked
[1:40:39] up and said lay not this sin to their
[1:40:42] charge and when he had said this he fell
[1:40:46] asleep he die the first martyr the first
[1:40:50] martyr he fell asleep he die that's
[1:40:54] right can't kill me can't kill you so
[1:40:57] the age of Pentecost started with a
[1:40:58] messenger of the Holy Ghost let's stand
[1:41:00] our feet come on
[1:41:01] musicians and then we know that
[1:41:03] continued on the day of Pentecost and we
[1:41:05] know what
[1:41:06] happened I remember we'll give this
[1:41:09] right here real quick Peter was the
[1:41:10] spokesperson and had the keys to open
[1:41:12] the door of the Gentiles until Paul come
[1:41:14] on the sink because then you got Peter
[1:41:16] Peter says hey Paul says things really
[1:41:19] hard to be understood in other words
[1:41:21] Peter's Revelation was good but Paul's
[1:41:24] was different as far
[1:41:27] as Paul was a prophet to write 80% of
[1:41:31] the New Testament but you see that right
[1:41:33] there on the day of Pentecost there was
[1:41:35] a Pentecostal Revival started before the
[1:41:37] book of Ephesus or before the church age
[1:41:39] of Ephesus started and Paul comes at the
[1:41:42] end of the Pentecostal age you see that
[1:41:44] everybody see that say Amen all right
[1:41:46] then you come over here to brother

[1:41:59] himself through a oneeyed black man
[1:42:01] param and different ones and then
[1:42:04] brother Bram comes on the scene and
[1:42:06] starts his message we thank God we're a
[1:42:09] part of

[1:42:13] the world he rebukes the previous age
