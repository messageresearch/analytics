the fullness of the word and not just part of it they've had part of the word all down Through the Ages the part of the word has come but the fullness of the word is here everything we need all the mysteries of God have been finished yes as he has declared unto who his servants the prophets and he brought that to me and you by a prophet just by way of an announcements real quick I'm not going we

we just come in and fellowship get to know each other a little bit more on Friday that's kind of what we made it I think some of them some of the youth are going to maybe hike a mountain or something but this young guy ain't hiking no mountain I give me my Mountain as as Caleb said give me my Mountain well give me my Mountain but that's what's going to uh transpire on Friday so it's just um kind of casual Saturday will be casual also somebody ask about this I'm going to cover it Sunday will be regular church service so you need to wear your Sunday best but Saturday is going to be still informal even with brother Joel Brown being there uh for the Youth um like and meals will be provided except for the the meal for breakfast and that at the facilities then on Sunday after the service on Sunday we will go to the farmer's daughter and have um dinner there it's $20 each plus tax plus tips which would be around 30 bucks a piece and cash or check only no debit card no plastic I don't know the Amish must not believe in it or something maybe we should do the same thing Dave Ramsey said maybe he live maybe he owns that restaurant C cash check only all right but just remember that uh you can't pay for it with a credit card so cash your check only and then we will eat there right afterwards and then we should be finished by 3: or 4 and then another another 3 hour come back home so we should be home way before dark so just come and enjoy the motel is a comfort in in or Comfort Suites in Johnson City uh super nice lady we've changed some of the rooms up a little bit and um we sure appreciate them giving us a little bit of a break have y'all Che tried motel rooms yeah yes ain't cheap that and rental cars goodness gracious we should have gotten a rental car business not this car sales rental okay a lot of yours were rented just for a few months and then you picked it back up again so yeah I know so anyway but just remember that we're going to have a good time in the Lord and remember the Morales will be here Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday uh they'll be here Wednesday and brother Christian will be leading singing for us and we sure do appreciate them and uh uh they're doing really good uh brother Isaac is doing a good job up there pastoring the people and we keep up with them so we just make sure we keep up with them and and we're going to haul them all down here probably by the end of the year maybe we'll get them all to come down here I don't know I don't know if brother Isaac is ready to preach here or not he might fall out and die but um we'll see what we can do we we can stand and hold brother up amen if he falls out we just take over for him it'll be all right let Michael preach for him or something I don't did I say that yeah okay just remember that um brother Bob will be preaching for us Wednesday night too so we'll just keep that in prayer and there will be service here for those of you that don't go there will be service here 10:00 one service

morning so just keep that in prayer also one other thing make sure that you uh that bethle camp I I I want us to try to take a couple days off if you can and go up there and work in the kitchen for them uh we are actually one of the closest churches that are affiliated with bethl and um with brother Jason Watkins and them and we're actually they're 4 and 1/2 hours and we're an hour and a half so uh let's go up there and at least support him a day or so I know some of you said you couldn't go during the week but if you could just go help him on Saturday and Sunday morning that would be good brother Aon are you going to you you going to help with the security this year or you don't know oh that's right we already talked about never mind we got it okay aon's banking his days cuz he's going to make a special trip the end of the year somewhere down south not Florida a little bit further down further than that so yeah I got you all right so let's turn to uh John 1 and uh sister Rama was we were talking between services and she said we ain't been here about 3 months is the last time they came she said you're still on son of man she it like part 60 something I said you just hang on you come back again and be part 190 something cuz we ain't even got to the son of man yet we we we ain't got we got to get to the Holy Spirit I hope we get to it a little bit today so let's bow our heads remember these that are not here the ones that that are sick and pray for them dear Lord thank you for this time you've give us thank you for the word that we have Lord and we want more we want more of you Lord amen Lord I pray that you'd open us up Lord open our eyes open our ears that we may see and hear you Lord be with the ones that are sick that are not with us Lord I pray that You' touch them Lord in their body Lord I pray that You' be with this church as a body too Lord all people that have anything to do with the church father we pray that you just give them strength Lord I know it's a uh sometimes it's a struggle to drive and do all the things and stay here all day and and spend money on food we we realize that Lord and we we pray that you will bless the people that have made the effort to come Lord and and sit and listen Lord to maybe just a moment of what you got to say say to them Father forgive us of our sins bless us in the further of their service we with us Lord as the Morales come visit Lord this week be with them on the highways be with us Lord as we um go and take some fellowship to brother Andre heads Lord we pray that you'd be with him Brother Richard Wilson also lord they're together we pray that you'd bless us Lord in our fellowship just be with us now and take care of us in Jesus name amen amen I touched something while I was praying all right in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God what that word you we're going to take it later on but when we talk about Agape you got to talk about the word of God agape love is the word of God that's what he that's that you know God could express himself any other way and he did he went to the Stars he went to the pyramid but he wanted to get it to us in word amen now when he got this agape love the love of God into word it became flesh because it had to be equal with us according to Romans 8 it had to become equal with us so that we can even understand this word there's a lot of things in the Bible I don't know about you there a lot of things in the Bible I don't understand hello there's a lot of things I don't understand in the Bible all right it's going to be made known but there is a lot of things I do understand in the Bible and I understand God said if he give it to us and required it through a prophet brother R said if God required it he's got to already put it in there for you to make it all right so if there's going to be brother R said the rapturing faith lays in what books and tapes these books and tapes which is the enhanced word of God for us it's the love letter that God wrote to us the in between the lines is what we're getting now is that love letter from God and it doesn't have anything to do with the Trinity doesn't have anything to do with false Doctrine it's truth all right so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace that's what I want I want us to get full we're going to talk about that in a minute about sister Shepherd's dream that that pyramid got so full it started running out that's what I wanted to do I want to start running out I I I don't I don't want to ooze I want to run I want to just just if Bly George needs something I want it just flow right down to him amen when you're sitting here today when you're out on your job where you're anywhere you're at doesn't matter if those people flip you off call you whatever you just keep you just keep packing it in you just keep letting it out listen you're going to probably be the only breath of fresh air those people ever see you think about that next time you choose your words choose your words lightly and you know don't choose your words lightly in other words don't do that cuz you may be able to what let the water out let it run on them and let them feel something that they never felt before that's what I want I want I mean they felt enough of of my junk yes and my and my stuff I want them to feel God and His presence as I've always brother Bisal told us this himself when we was down here in ' 06 but he was relating to the picture cuz I think his daughter had just painted the picture there's one it's right there in the room where he he painted a picture she did Brother brand he took a picture of brother brandham with the over the fire you know they were they were hunting and it's it's right in there but his daughter did that but brother bisc relayed the message that brother Brandon was going to like stay up a little while so he kind of took the first watch and kept the fire going and then and then um no brother Ed did and brother B brother brandom got over under a bush and laid there and went to sleep for a couple hours and then brother brandom you know he woke him up and said brother Bram now you know I'll let me take a nap he said he laid down right where brother Bram was at said said he had never had felt that feeling of a presence of God he didn't want to get up he said I never felt that before and you can see like some like sister CLE and different ones I know brother George Canada always told us that that when brother randam with look or he would say something to one person and they would be sitting standing right beside of them they'd feel that presence that's right you said oh that's just for a prophet no I want that to be us I want us to have the presence of God so much to till we don't not love everybody right that's what I want to do okay that's that's our goal let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem others better than themselves you may be seated and if we get to this we'll get to this today cuz I want to get to cuz we're going to have to explain and I didn't bring it today but we're going to have to explain that for those of you that are here that that have weren't here at the beginning this part of your journey or this part of your um Christianity starts at Faith and faith is a new birth all right that's when God takes the old nature you had Burns it out by the fire of God not by the fire of anybody else by the fire of God burns your own nature out and puts his nature in that means that you are birthed from above not birthed from Hall County hospital or Northeast Georgia Medical Center everybody with me all right or some of y'all old you birth at home but anyway praise the Lord that's right just thought I'd throw that in there but that's down here now we see this word Holy Spirit up here all right there are many people in the message now brother brandom and I'll bring the quote later on but I don't want to throw it to you right now I want to read you what Corinthians says but but brother Bown says you've got all this way and you don't have the holy spirit yet now then there's a teaching in the message that teaches that you got to have all these virtues before that's your new birth well that can't happen because this is God God God God God if you don't have the new birth birth you're devil devil devil devil devil thereby with me if you're not born again today you have a soul that is demon-possessed yes you do right either Faith or doubt that's right God or the devil one of the two yes all right so if he burns the old you out burns the old you out puts to puts to Genesis 1:26 man the love of God the agape love what we read in Genesis 1:26 when he puts that in there then you begin to believe like God believes then you begin to have virtue like God had virtue knowledge knowledge of God Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness but that Holy Spirit is written there for a purpose and it's very important all right that it's place there brother brand place that there listen that's not you can't read that in second pet Peter right all right cuz let me read it real quick second Peter 1 verse5 look and besides this now he talks about the divine nature of God all right come on take your hand like this all right you got it put it right here pinch amen thank you but anyway we're all family here okay yes we are we are where's the pares at that it takes both of them to take care of that baby bless her heart oh J you got the baby you got the where are they at baby I guess they so old they sing a song they have to go down there and get water and eat something and come on back up here I guess but I appreciate the pars they they have a good testimony and we really appreciate them coming and uh and being a part of our part of our assembly for a little while we borrowed them from brother juel so oh there she is now they'll come in after we after we talked about them so anyway what was I talking about I'm just kidding but now it says besides this in other words you've got to get the divine nature of God for him to impart it out cuz you can't just he's not going to impart this nature of God is not going to be imparted to me or you if he knows we're not going to go on or use it or if if we're going to use it wrong everybody with me so he gives you the new birth and then Peter says besides this in other words besides the new birth besides you starting on your Christian Journey giving all diligence add Okay add to your faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godl brotherly kindness now it continues on says if to brotherly kindness charity so the Bible to takes it on up to to hear but the prophet of God knew what he was talking about knowing that the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit Holy Ghost same thing had to be there to finish the product cuz watch let me just cover this if it's okay this the music they'll kill me if I do anything remember this is this is what we've been dealing with since Christ left everybody with me this is what we've been dealing with the headstone of the church has not been here right okay amen we've had the Cornerstone right Chief Cornerstone to build the building and even Paul talking about being a master builder Paul was teaching us Paul and Peter and James and all the different ones teaching us how to live this but this was withheld you why the Bible says The Headstone was rejected that's right all right so we're going by the Bible not by hearsay or what even what brother B said the Bible says that the headstone was rejected it was a stumbling Stone a rock of offense amen so it wasn't here it was now look still there right but it was hid the book was closed amen now it's open but the book was closed the seals how to get your body changed was withheld right right cuz Peter and James and John they had all this working in their life amen all right and I say ireneus and different ones too you if you may but this was not there everybody with me all right so that's why this is important we'll get to it in just a minute but now since the seals broke what came in in a form we could watch in Arizona in 1963 we could see The Headstone coming down amen amen coming down on the church not on just William brandham on all of us I say church I say bride listen denom nation in the world they a carry anything about Cloud that's right you see 90% well not 90 half the people in the message or are debating that was even there come on this is a sign to me that God is here that he came in 1963 through the word not but it came through a prophet had to come to a prophet because that's what the Bible said but it was the headstone brother R said to the church with the church or the bride everybody with me so that's got to fit though this yes the reason it came was somebody came to that that's right but you say well why did Paul not get the headstone Paul wasn't promised it right that's right first church agent was not promised a headstone only in the end time when the son of man that's what I'm telling you this this is not I wasn't going this way but I am now this is the this is the church age bride can everybody see this don't look at my Baldhead I know you did Aaron did cuz his like mine if I was about 6'4 you wouldn't see it amen but anyway this is this is a revelation that God give in the Bible that was open to Paul arenius Martin this was their message all right everybody with me this is their me this is the Son of God revelation God in a bride right right Son of God which is the new birth all right then when you get to our age it requires that the son of man according to Luke 17:30 and who is the son of man son of man is God that word I was talking about in human flesh now listen we know it was in human flesh here but it was in human flesh in a part right cuz Wesley didn't have an open book Wesley still preached trinitarian Doctrine God wed into ignorance of that and but let Wesley bring his message up of sanctification all right amen am I making sense all right so then you come up here to uh re to um Malachi 4:5 he's going to turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers 1906 no ad30 we're not going back the 1906 is right here 8030 is right here everybody with me all right he's going to turn us back that message is going to turn us back to where he takes not zero this guy out but takes their message plus takes their message opens the book and says no we got to get back to here to where Paul these three Church AE Messengers right here never preached trinitarian Doctrine right remember they only started baptizing in like 300 ad which was was in Mar past Martin heading into Columba by the Catholic church so those doctrines were not here that's why we had to be turned back to the faith of the fathers now remember brother Ram said though this messenger Malachi forced to do two things one take the people forget about all these lines this is where we are peoplewise TimeWise all right and he's going to turn us back by revelation to hear amen did did Brother BR said did I preach what Paul preached he said I preached what Paul preach did Paul make it he said yeah Paul made it remember he went over across the curtain of time he said did Paul make it he said yeah Paul made it he said well I preach the same thing Paul preached he didn't say I preach the same thing Wesley preached he said I preach the same thing Paul preached and in preaching the same thing that Paul preached he literally that message brought us back to here his message but that's the first part that's right if it brought us back to right here we just gonna die again amen yeah cuz we're right here I mean you can you can come back and start this race again and you just keep looping like this something's got to happen to bring this back so number two brother BR said two to open in other words in my paraphrasing to open the Bible to the Thunders and the seals to literally turn us back in other words what literally turn us back not to hear to Christ when he was standing on the earth cuz that's the son of man message Luke 17:30 in the days when the son of man is what being revealed today you're under that anointing of the son of man being revealed all right amen but we've got to go through this journey of virtue knowledge temper Pati god brother kindness that's why brother Mar said it was required it was a requirement that we make it but there's other there's anointings I want you to read this right here let's go to 1 Corinthians 2:12 maybe this will help now this is I'm heading I'm jumping way up there where it says holy spirit it's up there for a reason okay now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which is not false Doctrine right which things all so we speak now here's Paul saying I'm speaking this all right not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual amen all right now we take and we say the natural types of spiritual but we've got to understand we got to come to a place where the natural goes away natural is temporary natural is fio natural will make you sin right but the spirit of God will never make you sin that's right now the spirit of man Spirit of the devil absolutely but the spirit of God the Holy Ghost will teach us remember the Bible says and will show us things to come comparing spiritual things with spiritual and that's what brother B did he took us and he literally opened he didn't physically open a book he opened our eyes he opened our our revelation two back to the fath of the fathers then he said he would bring his message which would be the opening of the seals which in 1963 all that that happened as a sign to me that brother brandom not that he was this great something but he was but you know what it brought me it I knew at at my point of my journey that was a sign to me that God was back here in his entirety amen one human at the time one first fruits got to have one person here got to got get start somewhere amen Jesus wasn't in nobody but Jesus at the time Jesus was here everybody with me can I say that again Jesus was not in no other person when he was here but in himself but now on the day of Pentecost oh on the day of Pentecost there was 120 of them little Jesus is running around and that's what he wanted amen but when they started they started down here with a pure word kept preaching the word of God preaching the word of God till you get up to where the Catholic Church takes over and starts interject and brother R said takes the Holy Ghost out and puts their own ideas in now that's what happened but God wined at the ignorance of those people and let them preach that come on that's CU cuz God can't preach false Doctrine and Wesley was a man of God Luther was a man of God right right but their Doctrine was not all right right that's why I read y'all several weeks ago that a church without a Doctrine it's like a jellyfish that has no bite bone you got to have a Doctrine our Doctrine is I say our Doctrine is maturity you see some Churches they preach the same thing they preached 30 years ago 40 years ago and guess what you are what you hear you are what you hear if you're pastor can't get you past a new birth you ain't going past it praise God ours did amen there was a maturity taught and listen it's like brother um TIG we've known him I mean he he came here to church in 70 early 70s when he first came into the message I mean he didn't attend the church here but he would always come here for meetings and stuff and him and brother Dale were were were close then because we fellowship with brother do which was in augustae that kind of put us all together but um he said um he said you know he said people um think you and your dad's a little arrogant he said he said he said he he said I defended you he said no he said they just know what they're talking about abely Lord I'm just telling you that's what another preacher said he said no they're not arrogant they know what they believe what they preach and they can back it up and to me like brother like brother Dell always said you know brother um um Perry green you know bragged about being in 10 and something countries well if the dude went to 10 and something countries he ain't bragging he went right now if I go to bragging I've been in aund and something countries you can call me a liar cuz I've only been in a few Alabama was one of them but but that's what you see because the Paul Paul you know you know it's okay for Paul to say the boldness of preaching it's okay for Paul to say you'll be judged by my gospel it's okay to say for Paul you know well Paul said for us to be and for the you know Peter said for us to stand up and be bold you know stand up and be bold but when brother Dale gets up and bold they're like he's just arrogant well so was Paul Paul wasn't arrogant he knew what he was talking about listen Paul said you'll be judged by my gospel amen you'll be judged by the gospel that's in this church right amen yes and you more is required more is given more is required you can't sit here and say we drink milk that's right so if you don't get it it's your fault and mine I'm part of it too right but let's get back to this so he he brought us back to the foundation and now we are by The Prophet's message we're moving up into this statue of a perfect man but there's something got to happen right there that seals the deal all right we talk to you about in just a minute so it says besides this though giving all diligence add to your faith virtue vers of knowledge and all his temperance add add add add then we were talking about this morning about the Genesis 126 man the agape love the agape love is what come to you at the new birth that's what brought you the faith of Jesus Christ and not this is not the faith of William brandham this is not the faith of Samuel Dale or Wade Dale that's the faith of God given to you but once it's given to you I love what brother Brown said he said this is my eye he said God gave me this eye and now it's mine so in other words God gave me the Holy Ghost in 1998 now it's mine but you know what there's a requirement that comes with that God give it to you what are you going to do about it amen it's in your hands now much is given much is required let us make man our own image so he did so now he's working on that image to build that stature back not statue we're not statues statues don't move stature is what growth development it's when you when you got the little marks you know Dianna of course she's a tall girl but we've got her in the in the uh on the whatever you call that thing right there on the side of the door in the bathroom every time you know about every 6 months we'll socer up against that thing and we'll mark it you know and put the date on it she's growing in stature right and you can see the growth spur there SE several you know the the last year she's only grown about that much but buddy the year before that it was like 4 inches so you can track all that same thing with God same thing with the gospel if you don't love the Lord more than we started number one to 119 if you hadn't learned something okay you can blame me but I blame you too cuz you listen to it and I hope it was right but what are we going to do about it more is given more is required we have been given growth hormones we should be bigger and taller than others so God created man his own image so now we have come into that image and then and Masterpiece I love what brother Bram said he said the the the flaw so all the flaws of Moses uh Noah all the different ones all their flaws we look at them and we learn from them right right we learn from those they're our example as we were talking about this morning but God saw us as a masterpiece family and that's what he's building back listen God didn't tear it down right Satan tore it down but God through Paul calling himself a master builder He is building this family back up amen and we do have flaws we're human that's right but as brother Brown says the flaw the marring is what makes it a masterpiece amen how in the world would you have a testimony if you didn't have trials and tests you could not stand up here and give a testimony if your life was perfect amen I testify a day my life perfect you ain't never heard nobody stand up there and tell that usually it's I was this and I was that and I was lost and I was this and I got drug out of a trash can and I got drug out of a bar right okay then that we were marred that's right moreover Brethren I would not you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud that we talking about this this morning all passed through the sea baptized under Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat in other words went to the same message Church read the same message books listen to the same message tapes all right and did all eat of the same spiritual meat is that not what we're doing today we're eating on spiritual meat all right and did all drink the same spiritual drink for the drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples like I said before you took the old you take the Old Testament out and you've took about half your sermons out amen lots of testimonies you take out especially Abraham people preach on Abraham it don't matter if it's a Methodist Baptist Pentecost or whoever they preach on Father Abraham he's the father of the of our faith now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after in other words the things they lusted after Fame Fortune Lord why are you not doing this why are we eating all this uh Wafers we want something different so he gave them quail and killed them cuz it was not in the plan plan was for them to eat Mana cuz that's what he said I'm going to give you Mana I'm I'm going to give you a double portion on Saturday you or Friday you can't do anything with it on Saturday and well I'll start again on Sunday remember somebody tried to gather some even sticks on the Sabbath day and God killed him neither be idolators as were some of them it's written the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play is that what we're doing neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell on one day 23,000 people neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents that's when the serpents um poisoned them neither murmur as some of them murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer now these things were happen to them for examples and they are written for our admonition to whom the ends of the world are come and remember that word means pattern or the mark of a stroke or blow a figure formed by a blow or an impression hence a figure an image a form the teaching which embodies the sum and substance of religion and represents it to the Mind manner of writing the content and form of letter in other words sermons all right a pattern of warning of ruinous events because remember David stood one day and said God you've lived in tabern you've lived in Badgers skins all the whole time I want to build you a house remember and then Nathan said do all that's in your heart David but God went back to Nathan and said hold on a minute we got a problem David you shed too much blood he killed youah he committed adultery you've done too much David you can't do it but I promise you your son will amen so he gave him a son that built Solomon's Temple right but the ruinous events which serve as admonition or warning to others in a doctrinal sense it's a type a person or thing prefiguring a future person or thing Jesus was all in the Old Testament they just couldn't see him when he came here in flesh all right brotherly kindness so now we come to brotherly kindness what brotherly kindness was it was Philadelphia which meant just it's just love it's it's love for the brethren all right but our problem is is our love as I've always said our love and felio love is conditional think about that our fial love is conditional so and so is my favorite preacher oh what about the other guy I don't like him that must be on condition cuz that preach probably stepped on your stinking toes one day and that's why you don't like him or he said something you didn't like amen I've heard it right God don't let you decide who he loves amen I've said many times before there's a lot of you I'm glad you're not God I said you I'm glad we're not God because we're critical we have so much fio love to where don't you tell me now don't tell me that FAL love is not conditional you say I love my wife unconditionally there's days on now preach brother yeah I believe it will there are days I don't un love I just don't want to be around her right oh wait a minute y'all all lying if you're not Lily stop that business y'all ain't been married long enough remember that's why June tells me to go hunting do not tell him to stay home but we got to get our feel we thank God that God's love is not F your love amen cuz see then it would be just like this right remember though he can't unlove you if he loved you to begin with thank God for that he cannot UNL you if he loved you to begin with you're loved all the way through like brother Brown said thank God he can't see my sins he hears my my voice through the blood amen all right now remember put yourself in the person's place I've said always said before something happened the other day and um it was kind of a similar situation and you just don't know what people going through you don't know what people kind of day they're having so you just don't want to make their day worse right cuz like I said you're probably the only God or closest to God they'll ever see they'll see the God of this evil age and somebody cuss them out or give them the middle finger wave or or run them off the road and they'll shoot you now if you cut people off you know you right they don't care anything about life but you see somebody that's a little bit upset just say God bless you we were somewhere the other day and we say Lord bless you and I mean it's just like they go that's right now you do see some that told one lady told us yesterday said God bless you and I thought I did the same thing but but we do why should I mean we shouldn't be that way like I always said before uh and you know that's this is me if I go through Walmart and I see something laying in the floor I pick it up and put it on the Shelf if I go through the parking lot at the post office I went through the parking lot the other day and I'm going to tell the truth there was something laying in there in the in out in the parking lot I didn't pick it up if I can't identify it I ain't going to pick it up but most of the time if it's a plate or a napkin or a cup or something I'll pick it up and throw in the trash and then something that was in the floor the other day in the post office and two people just stepped over it well I picked it up and the Postmaster said I was wondering if somebody's going to pick that up I said yeah I try to make things a little bit better right my attitude may not be better but I try to leave the world a little bit better place and that's life lesson what was it Jes 763 all right but you know what it makes me feel better yeah amen good does it not make you feel better to make things better well you know what you say well that's human that that is human but if it's God telling you this is the things we need to do on the earth to keep it better and make it better we know this is God of the evil age we know that but You' got your own little world that's right you need to keep it clean my brother sinned against me shall I forgive him seven times a day that's pretty good but Jesus said no 70 * 7 brotherly kindness now you see if her brother's All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see be kind to him go anyway then they was he's talking about how in the world did Brother B do you put up with these people he said hoping someday see patience with him see temperate enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes you ever tried to do that brother R always says put yourself in their place cuz putting yourself in the place you understand maybe you understand why they're going through it or you try to understand what they believe and listen if it's contrary to you that's okay that's okay if they try to explain the Trinity to you I don't want you to sit there with a knife I don't believe that right listen to what they got to say ah I'm listen I'm I'm preaching on myself today me quick on the trigger nah come on but watch this John 13:34 this is what we were talking about this morning a new commandment and I put that in big letter a new one why did he bring a new commandment he really brought a new commandment out of an old commandment cuz he can't change the word of God he did not stand there and say all right you don't have to live the Old Testament I'm here now you don't have to live that no he healed that leper yeah remember he healed the people with the blind eyes what's the first thing he said he said go do the law of Moses because remember if you were cleansed as a leper you had to go to the priest and they had to examine you and if he found no scars or boils or whatever open sores then you were not a leper anymore and they didn't have to stick you over in the corner somewhere right Jesus didn't say well bless God I'm God I'm no he said go do the law cuz he was born what under the law all right so he's given them a new commandment that you love one another cuz they had always come to the place he knew one thing for sure those Pharisees didn't love nobody but theirself right they love their s you could tell that cuz they were always tempting God they were always tempting in the Lord by this shall you know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another in other words an outward display an outward display but let your communication be yay yay and nigh nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that has been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you that's hard to do yeah yeah right love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you amen amen it didn't say evil for evil what we always call it in the South get back at them right the golden rule in the south is do under others and run no no do unto others as you would have them do unto you okay do I brought back a memory do good to them that hate you pray for them which despitefully use you that's kind of why I said this morning kids I didn't like my parents either oh y'all did I'm listen I'm just so bad I'm just way off here in left field right field left feel thank you I like I even told my mom I hated her one time have you ever done that if you hadn't you done it in your head hello I hate you what do you mean I can't stay out till 11:15 what 15 minutes you would just want to be contrary to what your parents said if they said blue you want it black tell them I'm the only one who's done this oh thank you appreciate that your mom sitting right about that he's good did everything you told him to do I told him I said listen brother George I told him my kids and honestly they sat down one day and said dad what can we do there was two things they asked that day said what can we do to be able to do whatever we want to do all right because I put these rules rul out Anna you you got rules rules you got rules yeah rules got them written in your p no they're in here rules we all got rules we got to do rules they said what can we do dad and then what can we do to be famous I said number one I can tell you how to be famous you'll be on Oprah you'll be on maybe not well Phil Donahue back when y'all knew that who Phil Donahue was I said you know how to get on there I said do everything I tell you to do cuz since the dawn of time no kid has ever done everything their parents told them to do right Esther don't Li me I've known y'all since we were kids but anyway so they said well what can I do to U you know if we want to stay out to 12 or one just I said you know what I said pay my house payment pay the car payment I had one then don't have one now but pay the car payment I said uh oh uh the electrical bill will be here every month make sure you pay that or they'll turn your power off all right gas bill food when I'm hungry you got to go buy me groceries Josh and Hannah Hannah right I said now you can do whatever you want to do if you do those things I said oh by the way I need clothes I've had these shoes Dad I've had them for two months they're out of date we used to wear our Converse till our feet to to stuck through the end of it I said if you can do all that you can be king of this Castle but if you don't I am am and that's what the and but but now you if you tell them that way explain it to them that way see explain something to your kids and then kids like I said before pray for your parents don't don't despitefully use them and they're not despitefully using you because I'll promise you one thing for sure this is life Le lesson 763 kids you're going to grow up and God for forbid we make it long enough you're going to have kids right right find out and you'll find out exactly that the love that we had for you sure it may not have come the way you wanted it but does the love of God come exactly the way we want it no it doesn't cuz we go H if he'd love me he'd give me this no that ain't the way God works right no that's why he always said it was a it was a young man we were talking yesterday on my mail route and he said you know what he said God's ways are funny I said yeah the Bible says they are he says my ways are not your ways my thoughts are higher than your thoughts and other words you're just zeroed out amen that's right but thank God when you the mind of Christ you can understand a little bit of what God's telling us amen that's why the new birth is the most important then you become and go up to be an adult in Christ listen you can be an adult in Christ and be 202 years old or be 70 and be two if anybody 70 I just hit that number okay he talking about me yeah probably if you were 70 and still acting too absolutely but we want our don't we want our kids to grow up but it's hard it's a hard battle this is yes it's a hard battle to get them deceived so so the battle then don't let us you know I pray for Michael I pray for all the young kids but y'all pray for me pray for your parents like I said this morning you pray for them that they'll make the right decision amen amen cuz you listen listen until you get to the age of accountability they're your Holy Ghost so their decision is what you got to Bear am I okay brother Daniel did you did you grow up the same way his his grandpa was a message preacher he just from a whole line now Sister Raymond's like me he just picked her up out somewhere out of the world and amen I know that we know same way with June but we all come a different way right right you I've always told you you think about predestination you think about the things that you the choices you make in life I was dating a message girl right brother Hal Thomas's daughter Debbie jet was here she know she was a little nine-year-old girl so we've known each other for period of time and uh so I had you know I had she would come to church I'd go to church at brother Mike and she'd come here the only way we can see each other is go to church I kind of like that idea if you want to have a date come to church we'll see how serious you are amen I I I'm just off but but here I am and I'm dating this girl that's a message girl all right so I meet this other girl well actually she meets me and she's y'all know she smoked she had short hair cursed a little smoked a little wasn't no church girl now but now I went contrary to what the message tells you to do and I tell you now like I told Zach and Lily different ones you need to marry a Believer that's right all right don't get me that I'm trying to tell you but this this did happen for the good so I'm dating this message girl and then all of a sudden I bring I'm sorry but I bring that home my mom was watching she said who is that and where did you get her I said mama she got me she did she's wanted to knock me down I wasn't looking for another one but now to make a long story short though and and I say this I say this with all respect Debbie's not a message believer right she she just when she got married she just went out you know she didn't go out in the world and become wild but she got married had kids and don't care a thing about the message don't even go to a message Church don't even believe it short hair pants all that stuff see the difference I know my mother prayed for me to help get a good girl but she just wasn't she just she just wasn't expecting her we all want the best for our kids right but listen even out of a mistake I don't mean it was a mistake I'm playing an instrument from now on even out of what they thought was a mistake yeah there you go God put us together God put us together and listen it wasn't it wasn't no bad roses to begin with it wasn't like you know I found miss you know miss queen of the world and she found Mr King of the World We Were King and Queen all right but we fought like kings and queens but we made it we had our conversation in times past you don't don't get me wrong it wasn't uh uh what do you call it Camelot but now we love God a lot and that's what makes the difference amen and my parents prayed for me but you know my problem was though I didn't pray for them brother George am I getting somewhere with this kids I'm telling you pray and listen even us like me I need to pray for my mom and dad now connection of parent that's my living parents that's your blood down here long as you got them alive you need to pray for them amen Michael you need to pray for your mama your mama's done an outstanding I mean I I almost cry when I realized what sister milus went through to raise you two young man and boy does she do a good [Music] job but you know what even all that under all out of all that adversity she kept her Christianity CU it was true it was the foundation she' come to this church not just this church she came and listened she heard she matured and being that she matured she could raise too mature listen a k a parent that's a kid Can't Raise a kid to be a parent everybody with me I mean if you're 40 well I ain't going there never mind I'll get on video games in a minute if you're 40 years old and you got kids and you're sitting around playing video games you're lost I don't mean maybe not lost in the Lord but you're lost get a life love your wife play games with her what an idea but I say do you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father now we all want to be children of God right that's how to do it that's your formula right there for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you you do not even the do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only that's why brother Brown said look he said don't be clannish don't be clickish I know we all have our little groups but that's okay okay birds of a feather and I don't mean that bad I mean you know if you're sitting over there talking about um Electronics I might go somewhere else and find somebody talking about hunting you know but that's okay but if you're talking about the word of God you should never walk away from it cuz the word of God is what is common and what brings us all together amen it does and that's supposed to be that you feel com I don't feel comfortable around these guys talking about computers and bits and bites and right brother George it's like that ain't hitting anywhere but you start talking about a little bit of hunting I'll get a little closer to you but you start talking about the Lord I'm right there with you right that's what we have in common we may not like each other or as far as you know that uh things of the of the nature of going out and hunting and different things but when we come to the word of God it should be everybody's Focus turns in makes us all right sisters too if you salute your brethren only in other words Michael's my favorite I'm just going to hang around him you'd hate that wouldn't you I was going I'm just going to hang around him brother Dy this is my bud cuz you done something for me see what I mean conditional I'm supposed to love Michael even if he don't if I know he don't like me that's why I love all y'all cuz half of you don't like me so be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect dad told me one thing a long time ago and I want this is life lesson 769 n five 5 765 if everybody loves you you're a hypocrite and you think about that if everybody loves you you're a hypocrite I mean I these people grapes my cheese just the way it is and I grate theirs it's like dick said my spirit irritates your demons yeah yours vice versa as a father hath loved me we're just family as a father hath loved me so have I loved you continue ye in my love listen agape love remember fio love brother R I read the quote a couple Sundays ago all other loves have a beginning and an end right felio love has a beginning and an end you'll never love your wife on the other side like you love her now it will turn into total agape love which is Genesis 1:26 never had a beginning it'll never have an end all right perfect love is what brother Brown calls it so continue ye in my love now you can only continue if the Love's Eternal all right so we put our faith in Jesus that he loves us if you keep my Commandments look if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love amen now that's not just 10 amen even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full listen I appreciate when people uh you like brother Brown said that guy said oh I don't like people bragging on me brother Brown said he's a liar I don't mind somebody packing me on the back and saying a good job some of you ain't never done it but that's okay I can look over that this is my commandment that you love one another look not just because I told you love them because I loved you now I wrote myself a note brothers or sisters that denotes you're from the same family I mean you won't now it is okay to go to the convenience store and the guy selling liquor and beer and all that other stuff and you say God bless you brother but that ain't saying God bless you brother like we saying to us right we would like listen and that's why I was thinking about the other day I thought if I brought it this way they're going to they're going to say something about it but I'm hoping they're wanting to be my brother I'm hoping that my life will convert them that they will be my brother and come into the family family of God cuz if you're bornn again you're already in you're already in the family of God you're not struggling trying to get in you're in so you want others to come in ain't it comfortable to be around family I mean most of the time you do have them weird cousins but anyway but when I go home to day I'll go in my Mom and Daddy's house and I'll feel just as comfortable I take my shoes off but we don't drink on the tapt floor but we can take our shoes off and put our feet up and enjoy what's in the fridge if Mama tells us to no I mean so it's same thing here that's why I tell ministers I said look don't be nervous this is a family meeting this is brothers and sisters getting together together in a family reunion and we want to hear what you got to say about our daddy cuz now we all got the same Daddy I want you to tell me what your Daddy has done for you amen and I'm telling you today what my daddy's done for me and I hope it helps you cuz we got the same daddy right I hope we do Divine love and Sovereign Grace let me get this real quick 1956 now we are facing a day now this is 1956 think about today I was thinking the other day going down the road and most of the time in the South all of us are from the south pretty much you you know somebody comes by you know car comes by you or at least if you're driving you go you know hey how you doing you know right now you get the other one but nobody hardly now I mean it's just like well there goes Terence and he never said he never even looked at me but used to man you always you know and you didn't even know if you knew him or not so brother Brown says now we're facing a day which prophesied that Brotherly Love would become a strange thing among people that's right and it's to my humble belief that that is the greatest of all the gifts in the Bible wow amen I read you this quote the entirety of it so I broke it down a little little bit to save time brotherly love will become strange and it's my humble belief remember he he said if God took me on the platform and say I'm going to give you the greatest Ministry the greatest healing campaigns I'm going to give you the greatest gift but I'm going to withhold love from you which one would you want brother Ram emphatically said give me love right take every gift you've got God but one give me love so what's the greatest gift we should be looking for love love I'm talking about agape love and the only way you can get agape love is to be born again and then get into the word of God right all right let's look at this for a minute because this is a selfish world to be selfish is to be concerned excessively or exclusively with one selfie selfishness is one of the biggest obstacles to having the kind of close relationship with God why why because you look into self all the time I want to be able to look in the mirror brother George and see Christ not see this guy the kind of close relationship with God and the inspiring relationship with other people that many of us desire you can't be selfish and be friends to people I am crucified with Christ here's where Paul just laid it right out he said nevertheless I live in other words I've got a life yet not I but Christ liveth in me now I've got the new birth and the life which I now live like I said before and brother um Mike was bringing it out Sunday there was a life before this even though listen even though people can be loving and sweet and nice there's some just people have that nature and they'll be in hell because they never accepted Christ and that love right amen they're just loving people maybe had loving parents maybe had grandparents so it just came down through the kids I've seen people that way even like Brother Richard Wilson said he was preaching on statute of perfect man years and years ago he said that's a a man in my in my plant that's just so Meek and Mild said if you said look John I'm going to take your paycheck away from you this week and I ain't going to give you nothing I'm going to get you a paycheck he said that man and say well if you need it take it not me bless God I work 40 hours for that paycheck right well you can amen I'll amen for you every one of you do it how many of you ever give your paycheck to your that's what I thought and I said paycheck and I didn't say a certain person anybody except your wife boy can I go home with one of y'all J what you she's actually got the car keys and she's leaving me here I need somebody to take me home Hannah stuck in Six Flags without a key so she's got to go down there and they're going to make her a key so pray for that situation she's got to drive all the way to Six Flags so anyway she got to leave here in just a few minutes but you know what life happens do it for your kids right I am Paul says I am crucified but now the life I now live now look he didn't say he didn't live in the flesh he said the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God not my faith his faith amen all right who loved me and gave himself for me so he has took that life of himself out that's why you take people like brother Dale and different ones that that have just W look at his body now and I'm sorry if you think I'm bragging he's my dad and he's one of the greatest men I've ever met on the face of this Earth okay all right I wish I'd be like him more but I don't want to be him okay you understand I want to be my own individual and you need to be your own too all right but you take look how they wore their your self out why cuz of you amen I say Dad let's go hunting it's it's rut time you know if you don't know what that is look it up Google it not now later oh listen there's a new app on your phone have you seen it everybody's got it it's right on the side it says off use it sometime when you're in church Church you thought I you thought I really had come going didn't you it's on every one of your phone you thought I really had come going didn't you it's on every one of your phone they ain't one it's not on not one so anyway where'd all that come to H oh okay thank you see you use the app that's wonderful thank you I'm trying to find my thought back again so let's continue on the KN the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God so my life's been taken out and his life has been put in so what did I do oh now I know where he talking about so I gave my life up I called Dad I said come on dad it's rut time it's time to go hunting three or four days I got time off I can't I got a funeral I got a counsel with somebody I got a wedding and I got got to preach can't do it we grew up playing baseball and different things you know pretty decent at it and and uh he'd get out just every once in a while play catch with us but he wasn't inside playing video games he wasn't inside watching TV cuz we didn't have one he was inside with his Bible open and a message book out trying to get something from me and you and he's wore himself out because of it that see is the life I now live see and become so unselfish right unselfish a servant is never selfish let's continue on second Timothy 3 for men shall be lovers of their own selves oh boy Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and Unholy now brother Brown listen 1950 I'll tell you that's what a whole lot the matter with the people today they're not friendly 1950 99% of us wasn't even born when this was preached 1950 I tell you they're not friendly like they used to be the people's got too selfish got to a place where they think they live in a little world all by themselves you know that's the truth now I put this in red because this is a prophet tell I'm fixing to tell you three quotes this one another one and another one where brother brandham he says I despise that old somebody feels they're bigger than somebody else yeah H yeah he was a human 1954 listen to this I recognized the other day a selfish Spirit Come On Me of saying this man's wrong I ought to tell him about it he said that's wrong God's the one to tell him about it it's none of my business but my business is to preach the gospel and love everybody and move on and love my enemies as Jesus Christ listen we spend a lot of time what's that old saying I was trying to get it the other day maybe we need to Google that one too where it says that people spend 90% of the time worrying about people worrying about them only 10% of the time in other words I'm like what's Michael thinking about me I Lord he's probably sitting there no he ain't he's working he don't he he might he God bless my brother and that's about it you know I don't I don't do the same thing if if if there something comes up like sister i' had talk about something and and and she get a little harsh everybody sayen she and I clash with each other and we have but that's okay that's all all right but two minutes later brother George honestly with my hands up to the Lord It's Gone why do you want to keep how many times have you done that though you've held on held on and held on Gina held on held on I bet you I bet you oh um sister Anna is sitting over there at her house just steaming mad talking about me and and you know you go through the whole thing you know and and then like sister Anna came up to me one time she said I want to apologize for something something something and I'm like when did you say that right and I know one thing for sure once we get something straightened out it straightened out we're done there's no grudges there's no oh well I'm going to I got enough to worry about sitting worried about what y'all think about me collectively right right but we do the old saying we spend way too much time worrying about what somebody else is thinking about us when that person ain't worried about you they got their own issues life lesson 695 6 676 you got to keep up with it ought to tell him about it that's wrong God's wanted to tell him about it it's none of my business but my business is to preach the gospel and love everybody and move on right move on right amen me and Jun will have a spat well think about that just had one a few minutes ago and U but I'm over it now we'll talk about it later if she's over it but I'm over it now but how many of you have I ain't going no further worry about stuff that you should never even worry about and you should never listen you need to be in altar if you are are fabricating a plan to get back at somebody and we've done it wait a minute I'm not going to call any hands I'm going to raise it for all of you we've all fabricated a plan you remember what brother Dale and different ones that say boy you know I'm me and my wife we say something and I bless God I go to work and I'm like when I get home I'm going to AB absolutely let her have it she's F to get it cuz I'm the head of the house and she's going to get it she's going to just absolutely get it soon as you open my door she's standing there and your favorite outfit I said yours not hers and she says honey I am so sorry I love you and I got your favorite meal cooked on the stove it just blows you whole day really makes you mad more mad than what you were cuz you worried about all day what you going to do now is that not us and this has all got to do with brotherly kindness CU we do that to other people if you try to fabricate a way to get back at somebody you need a new birth thank God God doesn't fabricate a way listen he made a way for us to get back to him not to drive us away from him who drives us away from God we do we do amen my stinking self I want to ask the church one more thing before we get some place to study in the scriptures that you'll pray for me oh wow a prophet I I've developed a critical spirit oh now Brother brandom come on I want y'all to realize something did you see that he talks about having a selfish spirit in the word become flesh 1954 10:03 it would be all right if that was just one sermon I mean one thing and a couple of you know so the next thing he says he's going to have a critical spirit watch where he preached this at same message he's continuing down the line getting itself cleaned out I want to ask the church one more thing before we get some place to study that you'll pray for me I've developed a critical spirit and it haunts at me I told my wife yesterday the first time something happened now I was sitting in the yard and I told her she had reminded me and I told her about it I said honey I've got to a place till I become critical of people I don't want to be whose job is it it's not mine and God's the one to criticize not me Jubilee year 1954 this was pre in the evening of 10:03 same day different message I'm not going to ask you how many made the consecration but I believe many of you did in myself I did in My Heart Lord take that critical spirit from me he said it the morning and now he's saying in the afternoon same thing now I don't criticize people out to their face that's what I telling you after the service this morning I don't criticize people out to their face but in my heart I do I see a lady walking down the street especially that see she's not dressed properly I say isn't that awful in my heart I don't say it to nobody else after all that's her business she's a free moral agent she ain't got no right to do it Christ bought her life but maybe she doesn't understand wow so it's not for me to criticize let God do do that when I'm in the pull pit I'll preach the gospel the best way I know how and the rest of it I'll commit to god let's stop right there can't get to the rest of it musicians come on okay cuz we'll get to uh we'll get to the holy ghost in a minute in a little bit but I wanted to read that but I won't read it I'll wait it's almost 4:00 and and I forgot to announce that we needed to have communion today so I think we'll let's have it next Sunday I forgot next Sunday I didn't huh are you leaving me too okay we'll do it maybe the next weekend I forgot about today though somebody remind me of that cuz we didn't have it last weekend cuz we had special service let's stand our feet but we
