TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he's not gonna be here all right I'm gonna just keep right on through the part folder on the birth pains I'm just finished right on up and I'm not totally so I'm gonna pass into the baton like the only thing we got never recorded we're not going on so let's recap birth pains what causes birth pains when a message goes out and first of all that message going out and cause the pain because the people are coming out of that system that they're in within the people not just the preaching of the message but the one that people begin to receive it then they're birthed out of that that organizational system they're there in burnt-down of their own ideas and they come forth the birth born by the word and they and when you're born you come out so you come out speak and cry to have a father I believe the message I believe what God has spoken is correct I believe that the way to to the new birth is to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and who his name is and all those things and you keep confessing as you keep growing and you walk into your confession all up until you come to maturity and then finally to birth us from completely out of the world God sent us a message a shout to birth us from the things of this world that's the capstone and it births us out of this and come it's gonna change our bodies it's changing our bodies right now and and when you catch that then you begin to speak the same thing and that's what's going to cause the Damned to be raised as when the pride is saying the same thing that was spoken by the prophets message and so what's pulling us up was doing all the turning and the pulling him is this message the capstone message that the prophet priest that he brought today that he the the shout as the bride begins to catch the message then she's birthed from the things of this world out of the earth out of the things of this world that's why I preached to miss a long time ago called earthly shackles because all of our creeds and our dogmas are things they're all up shack loans to the earth and as you believe the word then those shackles are broken until finally the last shackle is broken and you can brush death off your own sickness comes up your honor you brush it off because you have become the word and so that's why we'll say you know when brother I preach the message the rapture it changes the way we perceive the rapture because we used to you think well the rapture was like this event that like the how they make movies of things about where that one one day just also thereby is disappearing from planes and all kinds of things that is one event but what brother Branham taught the rapture is is a process where you begin to you it really starts when it starts on a clothesline in religion where you say I'm not dressing right I'm not doing right I don't want to change the way I am because I heard the word and you start you begin to feed all the things of the world the things of God the thing on the word and it changes you from the things of the world to the things of God and that's a long process maybe because because it's really found that it depends on how much you can open your heart to the work to the word open your heart to receive God so I might want to when the kid was asking me how long does it take to be adopted and you can look at the disciples you just say well they say that were with Jesus for three and a half years and after that three years the spirit fellow limit the day of Pentecost and boom they shout up all the virtues were manifested in them so it really it depends home and how much word you can receive how much you could yourself up two and and that's really what the constraint is the God has been waiting on the readiness of the bride all these years he's been waiting on us to get ready because we to be an honest to do for round we don't give enough we don't dedicate ourselves to the word we don't get into the message and read about it and find it and see what it's really saying but back at the point I was trying to make people have have had a incorrect conception of what it means to miss the rapture to miss the rapture you could be missing the rapture right now if you're not in the books and the tanks you're not listening to what the prophets said because this is the rapture the rapture is the word that the prophets in and if you you know you so if you're not if you're not paying attention to what the message is you could be missing the rapture right now and so so these birth pains the birth pains are the producing the word and us producing a change in the world and we know that the change has to be in us first before the world can be redeemed that but all of these things are kind of happening simultaneously you can see that the three loaves world war one world war two all their four things we talked about last time all the earthquakes and things and it was at this 8.0 earthquake in Alaska just recently all these things are taking place in the world because there's something taking place in the bride and that has a it produces a chain reaction right that because there's a change of happening in the bride there's a change happening in the earth as well so what I wanted to kind of finish this last little little surgical lesson home is Anna's the bride is being birthed there's a twin produced because brother branham always taught in every revival there's a twin producer there's been carnal and the spiritual just like Isaac and Rebekah when they had the children they had to take it from Esau and then we're at war in the womb because that carnal and this always at war they're always fighting because they can't agree with one another they were at war all the way back to the beginning of in the Garden of Eden when when Cain and Abel came forth and came knock table upside the head with a stone or whatever he did and that continues all the way down word goes forth and somebody believes it because to confess it and say this is what it really is it produces it produces conflict because there's this twin being born and what what what's happening is this twin is an impersonation of the real thing and if you want to really around them even even talk that it gets as we get closer to the end time the impersonation gets closer and closer and closer you start out with like a cane move on up to Esau and then finally you've got a Judas that's right there putting his arm around Jesus with the money bag right in there with the camp casting out Devils he's right there next to the word made flesh he's right in there so you know we're gonna look at how you know I said that as birth pangs they produce they're ultimately going to produce in this world council two churches that bundles up all the all the denominational systems and and through that the Roman Catholic Church has an opportunity to influence the world economic situation but you know really that's not going to deceive the message believer what what the real the real doesn't there's a house they have another twin there's right sitting in the church right next to you a carnal and person ATAR that's that claims to believe the same message that you do but it doesn't go all the way and that's really what the impersonator does is they stop and just a sanctified life and they don't continue own like Jesus failed to do continue on to Pentecost he didn't go all the way and we know that's that's really the the Gospel message is to keep moving on as God as the message keeps moving on this fried keeps moving on and follow us with the work because when you don't continue to go on then you'll follow by an end innominate which is what happens is each message went forth Paul's message went forth something I came after him pullback denominated him and God mark Cyrenius mark mark and Colombo each of these men they preached a message in and they fell back and the people could not continue o and continue all this with the message and so they feel like in the denominator so a carnal the carnal twin can't impersonate the work and we're gonna look at another example as Janice and jammers who they could impersonate maybe they're throwing down the snake the sign in the in the hand all the different things but when it came to the word to follow that word out of Egypt to leave them aside all of Egypt and and speaking the word they could not be personate that so you know look at this there's a lot of things that you could impersonate you could say I've been taught there's a a just a natural that when you're born of their mother earthly mother and father you could you you even maybe have a natural virtue or you can speak words of encouragement to help people natural temperance and patience and all these things could be impersonated but when it comes to the opening of the word for this to the to the third pool you can't impersonate that you can't personate the third pool because the third pool is that the word open knowledge a super knowledge is super anointing and speaking the word and so another thing I want to bring out is is look at look at like Joshua and Caleb as they got to Kadish barn even then you really got an example of the of the two spirits right there one Joshua and Caleb were saying what God is able to deliver the Giants into our hands and and / they were it was really wanted to be and I wanted to be in a situation the whole rest of the group said well I don't believe that and so it came down to what their confession was one said I believe that God is able to take us over the other said I don't believe God is able to take us over all the others until they were ready to kill Joshua and Caleb and that's that same story of the conflict being repeated all the way down and so you know I really think that that we're seeing that kind of repeat even now when Joshua and Caleb maybe maybe frame with the statement that Joshua and Caleb made like this I believe that God is able to produce adopted sons and daughters of God I believe that the adoption time is now and everybody else was looking like like maybe like Balaam did all the people he saw the hinder parks he saw the the bad things the ones that weren't moving fast enough and he looked down on the people and said I don't see nothing moving in them I don't really see I can't recognize the pillar of fire and so you see those two one has a confession I believe that God is able to take us over and the other can't quite get there and so I would caution you and this time I believe this is adoption time I believe now is the time when God is a dumb brother and I said that way back and what 1960 1963 a long time ago its adoption time but now you can see more than ever something better to happen because like let me go to this this first the second slide they just adjusted the Doomsday Clock meant from three minutes to midnight to two minutes to midnight because of what's going on in North Korea you can look at the signs of the times all around the world and we know we don't base it on a calendar like a date or anything like that but just looking at the signs of the times something somewhere is happening to somebody and you say well I don't see nothing happening in this church let's say let's just say for example that there is nothing happening in this church but there's something happening somewhere somebody is going to be adopted and somebody is going to take a hold of the word and believe it because it's already been spoken God promised it his prophet spoke and somebody's taking taking it and running with it and I would rather it be man so I'm gonna I'm believing I believe that is able I believe I believe that God is able to take us over he is able to by the power of a spoken word that we have heard the changes in to adopts his sons sons and daughters of God so let's let me go back to this slide this is the this is a 1961 Brook where brother Branham said he was talking about how the Doomsday Clock was three minutes to midnight and we know that since then the Doomsday Clock is oscillating backwards and forwards and it's not necessarily an accurate measure it's precisely where we are as far as the dangerousness all these these are scientists and whatnot they kind of put together a little visualization see the people kick in a picture where we are as far as the how close we are to somebody dropping a nuclear bomb and so they just like the last week or so they move this to two minutes to midnight as an indicator that there's some stuff going on in the world that people should be concerned about doesn't North Korea is waving their hands and they're saying that Russia is behind it and all this kind of stuff and just a reminder that all these things we're not looking for a particular world of being to change our bodies what we're looking for is the word or change our body but this shows that there's something taking place is what's taking places in the bride there's a people that are catching on to what the message heat is their bodies their their their lives are being changed and it's causing a reaction worldwide and you can see see that it's going to produce twins and the twin that the other twin is this world council of churches that is coming together they're saying that I want to have that all together this year the middle of this year and what that will allow the Roman Catholic churches is through that World Council of Churches that is coming together in then they're a man-made unity it will all have a Roman Catholic Church to begin to influence the economy and begin to put things into place and everything and and it will reproduce what has been going down through all the ages the great conflict that where the devil is after the bride you see and so then then you got things like a brother man talk about one day that doors will close and the doors are kind of close now because there's all these people who are saying things about how don't listen to the five-point ministry don't you don't need to go to church and so that closes the doors in one way but one day the doors of the churches will be closed so that you can't go to church anymore unless you are under this World Council of Churches system and then it'll be like when when the door of the Noah's Ark was closed God closed he allowed the door to be closed Noah's Ark he'll allow this doors to be closed and you'll see something happen then I believe our births must have pain and that's what when the message goes forth it produces a conflict and that's what it produces a sorrow in your life as you struggle as a word was being born and so he just kind of took a recap and earnestly continued for the faith that was once looked at the same way back in 1950 brother branham said just as there was pains and growing's in the first birth birth of natural or have to be the same thing in the second making a man a new creature in Christ Jesus there's got to be fenders god we talked about that there's got to be a gardener yes Emily there's got to be a crucifixion a public crucifixion and so look for that public crucifixion when a bride is vilified they say talking about how when Jesus was publicly crucified what more could be what what more horrible think that it be did for people to laugh and mock him and scorn for the word that he preached it's one thing to be hung up there on the cross but when people pointed you and say well these people aren't Christians and Keena my wife and I were talking about even now today when she goes into Walmart or anywhere you can see it's like people hate somebody this wearing a dress I was walking behind my family at a part recent land and and these young girls were walking by they began to laugh and what who do they think they are wearing their dresses and you think that people are more receptive to that kind of thing in this modern day but people hate it you know like I was thing about the Nazis when when when they kind of pull the the gates back of the restriction on the people and gave them an opportunity people to shoot people in the back of the head there were many people that were willing they were glad they were happy to shoot people in the back of the head and you think there's an undercurrent today of people around in the world that would be happy if it's just the restrictions of the laws were Unleashed they would be willing to do some pretty horrible things and that's what's going to come on the face that's what's going to happen during the tribulation all Jacob's trouble all those things because there's got to be a purging the people that cannot come all the way now well that will give them an opportunity to be purged under the sixth seal of perfect of the world all those things the but you don't want to be purpose that will because if the if the things that they endured on their Eichmann and Stalin and during the Dark Ages or think about how horrible that was we don't want to go through the tribulation it's time to to open our hearts fully to receive the gospel that we've heard now so that the word can be born in us because we don't want to I think sometimes we kind of get so caught up in the theological aspect of well God's going to save other people then then the ones that hear the message that's true now that's true but but think about what those people would have to go through to go through the tribulation or to stand in from the white throne judgment without knowing what you're standing on you're just being you just in from the white throne judgment being judged no not only based on his works but upon your works so certainly there will be salvation to those that don't hear the message there'll be many people saved but we want to receive the word that we've heard now hear the gospel now but let me hurry I'm not I'm not going to give in my slides so it's this is adoption time and brother Graham way back in 1953 and the valley full of ditches says it's adoption time he said that's what's matter today brother the church ought to be an adoption right now bring into the full favours of God but the thing we're ups and downs and ins and outs and ups and downs and in and out del God can't trust us with nothing hardly and then this day the Scriptures fulfilled he talked about the pains that the world is going through and finally she had birth planes pulling up blowing up pull them all up until she delivered a son of the gospel which was the Word made flesh which is really the focus of what I've been running out and bringing forth that son of the gospel word made flesh again now bring Jesus Christ to his bride he said in this day scriptures were fulfilled in 1965 that's why the churches in birth pains for the deliverance of the son and things that are to be he said that you've got to be born again he said that why goes to show there's more for you so you're craving it your little birth pains are coming home so you need more so that we can be happy and free and perfect we got to be and then in unity now this is the scripture that I was listening to some denominational preachers recently and they will bring it out really it's just really amazing what some of them are preaching about the World Council of Churches coming together and how that they're using like Kenneth Copeland and Tony Palmer and others are using these scriptures ephesians 4 11 and 12 Malachi 4 5 and 6 to justify the World Council of Churches to come together and so the word is bringing the bride together which you know a lot of skeptics and things the young people so lots of people even around the message say well it seems like the message believers are not in any kind of unity there's all these disagreements and things everybody that seems like they're at each other's throats and and you know to a point I would agree honestly and ministers meetings everything that seems like there's not too much agreement but there's one thing that I'm assured of is that the bride all around the world is coming to a unity that what's he bringing them together is the Spirit of God as uniting the bride and it might be like brother Adam tall and it is a small small group of people all around the world one here one there but all around the world are coming together into a unity of faith that is not going to be a you at some particular geographic location but as the unity under the word now what the World Council of Churches is trying to do is they're trying to produce a unity based on just same way everybody we just saw all roads lead to God we're just all one instead of coming to the word they're trying to trying to create this man-made unity but they read this scripture scripture I was listening Kenneth Copeland read this I'm just going on the internet so he read it he read this scripture too we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and we his more be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby that a lot they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ and so they read this about coming into the unity of faith and yeah it's interesting too that they read about the sliding men and cunning craftiness because that's exactly what's happening yeah by that cunningness and their craftiness and saying words of the you know encouragement to one another and it looks so beautiful and so wonderful but seeing how you can impersonate all the way up you can impersonate it looks good a kind no priest somebody that's real sweet and humble and and looks nice and fine on that on the outside but they can impersonate the word they cannot impersonate the third pole what's the third pole will effectively blame the third pole is this because you come through three pools of your own journey where you start off in a justified by the new birth you you are just there's who can only think of the charge of God's elect agonic begins to produce a sanctification by the word in Washington you by the word a higher form of sense of sanctification until you come up to the headstone where he you you hear the message for your day from the message being from that now we know we believe all the message from 1953 or whatever all the way up to 1965 but the shout the message the capstone began in 1963 when when it really began to preach the seals and preach all the all of all of this and so that's that's when when you feel that cool when that pulls you up you enter into the third pool and that is something that cannot be impersonated I've been back I want to appreciate this and so so when when something that happens when a revival happens and we know this this is the greatest revival of all that's right look you know people say the Bible days are over but when the word begins to open up to the bride there's a revival fire and you that will never burn out because it's been kindling you and it just keeps growing it grows from the face olive oil is come on come back and so when a revival is preached now revival always produces twins and that's why we're talking about twins whenever there is art available it always produces twins that's the root of Martin but it's true when it was a birth from I produce twins when the world was created produce twins to trees and it goes on down that one look to the natural intellectual the other one walk by the spirit and that innovation apart that's that's the dangerous part that's what Paul preached it you could have you could understand all mysteries had it fair all knowledge but without love and and now now that's that's the treat part without love because perfect love in your soul is down here but perfect love here is the full redemption of the body that's why people that's what sort of tricks up its up so many people they say well how can you have perfect love until you get all the way up here what about the ones beyond the curtain of time I'm gonna grab one over there and they they he said they all had perfect love perfect love and your soul that's what Redemption is three stages are interesting for your soul it's your spirit lined up and in your body perfect love and in your soul down here but we're coming to this perfect love well you have come into the full unity of the faith where you come to line up perfectly in sync with God's Word matching pieces and brother Brennan said you cannot impersonate the magic pieces where your life matches exactly what was in heaven before the foundation of the world matches exactly that one twenty six seven member you have the the word is now in flesh in you and it matches perfectly with that well I got off my twenty let me get back to this that spiritual seat and here in recognizing acting on the Word of God going to said but that spiritual seed to the Living God though it has to be a sojourner though it has to be a Rambler it always causes separation he says this church settles down see it cannot go on and that's why it's so important to keep moving on we don't say well I believe this put a dot by put a comma because that God will continue to even after we get out of here there will be a message of cheer downs of the endless ages because God will still have more of himself to unfold so don't put a period on the end of your revelation but keep moving home because if you put a period on the end of your revelation down here then you wouldn't be able to move on to verse here you keep moving on up until you come to the full unity of the faith Esau was a very good type of the carnal believer that you've never able to overcome the world he don't that's that's the difference Janice and Jambres didn't want to leave Egypt days and Igor couldn't leave Egypt the King couldn't forsake the things of the world and follow after God Judas was so interested in the money bag and said after that the woman who watched Jesus feeding and all from then on Jews had a problem because he couldn't be get out he couldn't lay down on the things of this world knowing he couldn't he died there's gotta be a death to have a birthday man he couldn't lay he loved the things of the world so much they couldn't keep going on until the kingdom was birthed in they still like their Corral their dicks and their manicure makeups and the women on their faces and cutting their hair and still belong to church and all of us and you can keep reading but then carnal and the spiritual because it twins are being born that clock is my enemy the program he talks about in the unfriendly realities of the Living God that the spiritual they got their eyes on Christ because they were elected to eternal life they plant right there on that it takes everything if you take everything it takes everything that God they plant there the other is a nominal man he goes to church he feels just as good as the rest of them goes home oh my that's that's dangerous that's that's the danger zone right there when you come to church and you feel like you've done your religion you've done your religion for the week and you go through the whole exercises and you go home and you say well I'm just as good as the other one there well there's somebody else there that is dying to their self and you soaking up the word and then going home and studying and when they sit in church they don't they don't complain about how long the minister's preaching but they're eating it up and that's the difference between the carnal and spiritual that's how close it is in this day it's gonna be so close where Jesus Judas is putting his own around the word and say I believe the same thing you do I'm casting out Devils I'm doing all this kind of stuff but he's sitting right there amongst the people and so you say well brother Bob are you preaching against me I'm preaching against all of this was if we can all get it get an understanding of how close it's gonna be with I think we maybe wait up like program said in the beginning of why Christ speak he said everybody all well all of us we need to be down in the altar seeking God and praying for God to come in and restoring us the joy of his salvation might as well do the dying now because get it down by the way before before the bad times comes every model produces twins just as Jacob and Rebecca produced wind as he said in the ephesian church changed and Jacob he didn't care how long he had to hang around or whatever he had to do the many thing in his life was the birthright and you know we can look at the birthright of the Old Testament from also some theological standpoint would represent real and all that stuff but brother Aaron was typing that as the new birth there's nothing more important than being born again and nothing more important now in this time then adoption because this adoption time it's time to get adopted because if you're not adopted if you don't come to adoption then you're gonna go by the grave and that's that's one of those things that I know blows a lot of people's minds that I've been kind of talking to my wife about how I honestly I have presented that wrong because the way that you should worry is you can't take a body change without coming to adoption right you can't go in the rapture without coming to adoption because you go by the grave you come up and then you go in the rapture but the body changes what we're talking about and so when I say I've said in the past you can't go in the rapp rapture without that's that's a correct incorrect way of saying it because what we're trying to do is we're trying to go from walking around now sitting in church directly into heaven without without tasting data and so that's what I mean when you you must we're it's an option traffic Jesus and Jews come out of the same tribe and in the same church and even the Holy Spirit of the Antichrist is to be twins so close that will deceive the very elect that's possible hey you know you can even see the twins and the seals if you listen to what brother Wayne has been preaching out as as the Beast set come come and see then then the devil impersonates and he says okay now I got what God is doing and how it goes as a rider now you can see that down through all the church ages but you know it represents something a little different in your own life as you see the word being born in you then you see the rider going away now see see what the devil does they see always he can't he never does anything first there's a quote we're gonna I'm gonna lay that out he's always wanting to see what God does first because he isn't he don't he's not a creator he doesn't have any understanding outside of what he sees God do so he's got a weight firt and that's why you know all these things that are happening in the world are a side effect of what's happening in the bride because the bride God produces his word in the bride and then if the devil looks at that and says okay now I see how to make myself fully manifest in in the Pope in the people in the system and he incarnates himself in the in the people the same way that he's watched God incarnated himself in his people and that's really that's really the twins and he said in in birth pains which again is where I'm getting all of these lessons and them to today is in the womb of the church and in the womb of the church because that's where the bride came out she was called out of the church and then there's another group that's that's called out too but they standard carnal ideas and they don't go on to the new birth and so it produces this this horrible situation and there's a great big system trying to be formed he said called the World Council of Churches and from the womb of the church is coming forth to children you just mark my word the world's and the word must deliver the word bride Church the church has got the believer that could be delivered out of her a bride for Christ then that fell asleep and all ages will make up that bride they come out on the word that they come out on the light from your feet coming to your head she gets greater and more you have to have and so forth as the body grows up so does the body of Christ grow up and then finally the head will come to let's see now he's turned up the bride gets greater and greater but this twin is also gives you greater and greater because they say it's a it's a the devil sees more and more of what he's in a person a demon and so it gets greater and greater from a came to an e so the bail mixed in there somewhere all the way down to Judas right there amongst the people experiencing the same blessings he talks about the two of them are fighting she speaks to bring from with a perfect word and I'm gonna finish up and just hearsay let me let me get to these last few slides he said he's going to produce uh stillborn baby an ecclesiastical system that's going to bring all the denominations together to produce any II saw that hate speaks Jacob I hope you see it a stillborn and their denomination all of them going together all of them going together and and now the Kenneth Copeland is and and the Catholic Church and the World Council of Churches coming together is not just bringing all the denominations together but they're bringing the Muslims together the Jews together everything is going together into this great big thing and so that's what if you go to look at these websites this big conference that they had look at the look at the headlines of this website reconciliation matter this is from this for this meeting in 2017 to they had lack of Christian unity harms gospel witness there's not unity in diversity you think Jellico's Orthodox and Catholics discuss justification and reconciliation and that's what's on their mind is coming back together completely contrary to the word but they don't realize it United in Christ icon this is another one of their big websites working to strengthen the whole body of Christ the mission of United in Christ is to promote the reconciliation of all Christians and Christian churches who profess creatures Christ as Lord and Messiah everybody coming together and so these things are happening behind the scenes that's it let's look at what he said in to hearing recognizing acting on the word just a second not just the carnal church the one out there the regular routine Carl church the Esau group which is what those slides represent the carnal church we got now the Judit Aryan group which is far more treacherous far more treacherous coming right up into the very hands of the blessing and so there's two really groups one that's making this world Council of Churches and the other this sitting right there in the blessings saying they believe the same thing but they'll and I'm gonna finish right there [Music] every day I [Music]
