========================================

let's just give the Lord and pray Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word I pray Lord as we look into your word and study these things out or you're quick in it to us Lord and help us Lord that our hearts will be prepared Lord for the word that we receive today I pray God that shall just be with brother Wade is he studying Lord Jesus granted Lord that you'll bless our services today in your name amen now we've been studying out Hebrews 11 which is uh I I just uh a summation of all of the great things that God that God has done in people's lives they should build our faith to realize that if you believe that anything's possible and it starts off it says that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen you you when you've when you've got and brother Brown would explain that faith is a revelation that makes that means that faith when you've got when God speaks something to you it it uh goes beyond anything that that you can see or feel whether you're with your natural senses it trumps any any kind of circumstance because faith is is tied to God it's it's something Eternal when it's when you when you go beyond hope to to a living reality of the god of speaking to something to you now we're talking this morning about um faith is because faith is a revelation that goes with anything if you've got faith if God reveals to you the correct way to be baptized who who uh that that God is not three different people and you really have a real revelation of that it's a substance to you it's something that nobody's going to take away from you because of their of of reason or anything and it's not based upon the man's ideas or something but it's based upon God's word so all our if faith if our faith is based upon God's word then everything in a Christian's life everything everything the in the economy of God centers around the world that's why we come to church is because we want word we want the word we want to get fed because that's where we get our faith from faith is built upon the word it comes from hearing the word so the whole uh the whole system of God is based around the word so what what's what are you craving this morning you want some word uh somebody was coming in the door and we were standing at the door and there so I forget who it was but they said feed us this morning because we want that's what a Christian wants why because that's where that's where you get your faith from faith and the more word you hear the more word that you receive the more faith you get if you really open the door of your heart and and you allow God to come in and Quicken that to you it it produces something that is a substance that is the evidence of Things Not Seen now I mean we've got and Paul goes through the summary of all these all these uh great Hebrews of the faith that they subdue kingdoms and and we read this last time so I'll maybe just kind of go quickly over this slide but you look at this and you it I think that should just build our confidence that if these individuals did these things by their confidence in God's word and what should we be able to do by confidence in God's word see as you as you hear the word it actually produces a confidence in you where you start to trust God and you start to know God and you start to have confidence and if he said that he's going to bring it to pass and your faith begins to rise and it's rising that's that's what the stature of a perfect man is about that's what the that's what the third pull the opening of the word was to do is to build your faith that God would uh open the open the tear off the seals of the whole Bible so that you could have faith to believe that anything is possible to believe for a body change so brother man said in faith cometh by hearing he said God will look right down in your heart and see that almost faith in the promise that's that's kind of what we're talking about because when we when you look in the Bible it's it's a lot of promises so if you can believe that God made the promise and he's going to begin to pass then diseases will melt back from side to side cripples will walk blind we'll see death will hear dumb will speak why they have taken God at his word now there's a challenge for us this morning can we just take God at his word if God said it he's the one that made the promise my brother I'm said in the power of God he said what is it a revelation what is faith is God by the spirit revealing to you something that he's going to do or he's promised that should give us confidence this morning that if God really reveals something to you how to be baptized what who God is all these different things that we know if God's really revealed it to you then it wasn't something that a man taught to you he you it's taught in your mind at first but when God reveals it to you it come from God that's I I think sometimes we you know we well in Ephesians 4 11 and 12 says that God gave five gifts into the church Apostles prophets and so forth for the perfecting of the Saints that's that's for your perfecting but the perfecting brother Brown would say comes between you and God and see if we can get that really home down so that we're explaining it right when you're perfected it's a relationship between you and God that's God doing to you personally that's something that the minister won't do for you the minister gives you the word but it's up to you to believe it when you believe it then now there's a relationship between you and God God is the one that's given you the revelation he said now if you only hear Faith cometh by hearing but hearing is not Faith a loaf of bread is purchased for 25 cents but 25 cents is not the loaf of bread see here hearing only brings the word that produces Faith but faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen then you see you hear the word god reveals it to you that it is the truth and by Spirit revealed truth confirms your faith to God then that's the the church that God built upon the rock that the gates of hell can't Prevail against it that's a promise too that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against a revelation because if you've got a revelation it's Eternal it's substance it's something that the devil can't attack the devil can't take it from you in perfect faith and when he was talking about Peter walking on the water he said Peter he was doing all right till he got scared the word told him he could walk on the water that's how a lot of us do we look in the Bible and it says you can be healed it says you can do whatever that it said that Peter could walk on the water he was scared first he thought it was a ghost and he said Lord if it be you bid me come to you on the water what he feared happened what he believed happened now look at that what you fear will happen what you believe will happen so let's not fear let's not be afraid and we don't have any reason to fear when we've got God's promises that we can look at it if God said it we don't have to be afraid when he believed he could walk he walked when he believed he got scared in his belief then his substance lifted he still professed his faith but he didn't have the substance the substance whenever right over top of that white cap and went right on to him see if he has the perfect Faith see but he didn't have it he thought he did he did it first he was willing to venture out why the Lord told me to do it it's got to happen so he just steps right down out of the boat and takes off he never thought about the waves how contrary to what they was he never got that in his mind and the second hand of the robe he said you don't look at the symptoms you look at the promise symptoms are one of the greatest hindrance God has to work with his symptoms you don't never go by your feelings Jesus never did say did you feel it he said did you believe it see where you get the thing all turned around it's your faith in his promise that does it like Elisha he wanted the promise and if Elijah said he could have it if he kept his eye on him he kept his eye on him you remember that story of Elijah how he followed he followed Elijah through three stages and I don't know if I could remember the school of the prophets the then the next phase and all over to the River Jordan the death and he followed him through three stages just like just like David went through three stages and Abraham went through three stages and you're going to go through three stages and he kept his eye on the prophet who who he knew he was going to take him through three stages until he saw the word come to pass because he was looking at the promise now see you and I are not looking at we're looking at the promise of God that God made that's why even when we when we listen to brother Brown and we're not even listening to the words of a man I'm gonna quote this um this is one of my favorite quotes or when brother Brown was preaching and looking to the Unseen God just took him over and began to speak through his lips and he said if you go back to that message you could hear him say this he said I'm the Lord that raised I'm talking about the promise that's where we have our confidence is in the promise that God made he said I'm the Lord that raised up Christ from the grave I'm the one that sent the Holy Ghost I'm the one that give the promise brother Branham has nothing to do in this he surrendered his life to me I'm using his Spirit I'm talking through his lips that's me I'm the Lord so we we have confidence and not the words of a man but we have confidence that God is the one that spoke God is the one that gave us this message God was the one that gave us the word and you see that's what built will build our faith up faith in what God Said brother Brown said in the power of God he said what is it a revelation what is faith is God by the spirit revealing to you something that he's going to do or he's promised now if you only hear Faith cometh by hearing but hearing is not Faith a loaf oh I already read that quote oops and the statue of a perfect man he said first there's got to be faith faith is the substance of things things hoped for it's you already have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith Hebrews 11 see the evidence what is it what kind of an Evidence a holy evidence therefore when you say brother Branham I believe that God Is A Healer well if you believe that and then accept him as your healer and not lying but actually believing that by his stripes you are healed there's nothing going to turn you from it it's a subtle thing now you might have hope just keep dodging to this and Dodge into that but when you got faith you know it because it is the evidence you've already got it now a lot of times we'll get real emotional like when we're reading through all these stories in Hebrews 11 there's a lot of places where somebody could get real emotional like for example Abraham when God told him to go take his son to the top of the mountain he could have got real emotional and said well that's my son he got real emotional and then it just wouldn't have worked he'd come down and say maybe explain to his wife or someone his church folks well it was my son and I you know how could God expect me to do that but you see we've got to take everything back to the word our emotion our motion doesn't matter our fear doesn't matter you got to take everything back to the word because that's what we're basing we're basing our confidence in brother random said and then faith is once delivered to the Saints he said this brother prayed for me and this one cast The Devil out and this one that and the other he said mental emotions can do that but when that real genuine faith that God spoke the truth is settled in the person's heart it's eternal feeling has nothing to do with it no more God said so then that faith is stable no matter what takes place how you feel whether you get sick or whether you do or not that has nothing to do with it it's that faith that was once delivered to the saints that they believe oh so many times where like you think about Rahab she could have got real emotional and said well how could somebody expect me to just have confidence in a little Scarlet uh ribbon and I hang out hang out in my window but emotion emotion has no place when the Seal of the Antichrist he said upon emotions you can't rely upon that although that's right that goes with it you got to get the real thing first I've seen people stand throw themselves back and forth and work themselves into a panic screaming to the top of their voice and walk through pits of fire without even touching it and deny there was such a thing as Jesus Christ so that doesn't mean anything I've seen them such frantic hollering Allah until they take a lance and running up through their chin and nose like this and pull it out it wouldn't even be a drop of blood come out certainly cut themselves in the flesh of the prophets when the in the Feast of the prophets when they're cutting the leaves that the young ladies sitting there cutting leaves and the man laid his arm out and take a saber and whack his arms like that wouldn't even bleed in such a frantic you get what I mean and see I got a picture of something I got off the internet if somebody actually walking through coals of fire and so you can get real emotion on the outside but now on the inside there's nothing there's no substance and that's why the the evidence the evidence is faith faith will produce an emotion faith will produce a reaction but look down on the inside do you really believe because that's and and and how are you going to really believe without the word that's why what we want this morning is the word because the word received in a heart in that good ground that Jesus talked about it's if the if the word is planned in the good ground of your heart it's going to produce then we get all feared and brother Brown said it's the scare that burns you you got the Holy Ghost that's operating in your body well when that old snake grabbed a hold of Paul's hand that was not a bit of scare he looked at it like that shook it off in the fire and went on and got some more sticks it didn't scare him see if you're not scared Jesus said well why did you fear Peter come walking on the water doing fine until he's seen the waves were contrary then he got scared and began to sink Jesus come picked him up said why did you fear oh ye of little faith fear you're scared it won't happen don't have one bit of fear move forward God said so that settles it now now we're saying all don't don't be emotional don't get caught up in emotional don't use fear don't don't be afraid but you know really what's going to take all that away what takes the fear away is the word of God the word of God is what settles everything and so as you receive in the word you have confidence in the word and begins to take the fear away you sometimes we come to church and we just want to we just want to work it up well I'm not going to be afraid but you you can't work it up in yourself how are you going to not be afraid the word of God received into your heart is what takes the fear it away in Luke chapter one you know when when when uh the angel gave Zechariah a promise that he was going to have his son John the Baptist and that he didn't believe so his his mouth was shut up uh when his mouth was finally opened right at the uh near the birth of John he began to prophesy and this is what he said this is part of what he said he began to speak about the promise that God had given and he said the oath which he swear to Our Father Abraham that he would Grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear that's a promise that we've got that's that's why God sinned Jesus Christ on the earth to die for us so that he could give us back the holy ghost that you would have a revelation of who he really was and it would take the fear away and Holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life so when we have faith real faith it gets rid of the fear real faith is substance where there's no it's not based on emotion it's not based on because you jumped around or ran up and down and screamed but there's something down on the inside that's confidence and what God Said that God said it so I know that God is able to perform it if God said I can be healed God is faithful to produce that if God said that somebody can get the Holy Ghost I'm going to get it that's where you start having faith faith in God's word so in the Bible it says where Paul speak of faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report if you want to if you want to make God happy that's the only way to make God happy reading that's the only way to get a good report is to believe what he said to have faith in what he said through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which were seen were not made of things which do appear now see Paul's setting the stage for all these examples these Faith examples and he's starting off with saying through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God the word of God is so powerful that it could set the sun and the moon and the stars and all those things that the James Webb Telescope was unfolding all those things are hung in the heavens by the word of God so if the word of God can control the heavens what about your life if the word of God is powerful enough to control the Heavens to set the heavens in order and then what about the problem in your family what about the problems in the all the circumstances in your life if you have faith in the word of God that is able to set the worlds in order so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and the door of the heart brother Ram said I found a picture once that was well sorry let me go by to this because Hebrews 11 is is about the it's the Hall of Faith it's looking at all these examples of people that believed and and the impossible was accomplished in their life so brother Adam said in the door of the heart he said I found a picture once that was striking just can't think of the artist who painted the picture but it was of Christ knocking at the door and while he was knocking at the door he said all famous pictures first has to go through What's called the Hall of critics before it can go to the Hall of Fame that's a beautiful thought did you know all great things has to pass through the critics God's blessed church has to go through the critics and stand the criticism before it can be took to the hall of God's Immortal thing and the scripture says all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions so if you're not persecuted for righteousness sake not something you brought on yourself but for righteousness Satan there's something wrong somewhere now why is that everybody's got to be examined your doctrine's got to be examined your faith has got to be examined you're going to have to go through situations in life just like these in Hebrews 11 because your faith has got to be proved out and God will set you through circumstances and things to test you and prove you just like Abraham and David and every other one of these Rahab to see to prove do you believe and so if that's if that's the case for these people that we're going to read about and that's the case for us I I want to I want to set in my mind to believe God's word because I want I want to be I want to be found faithful when I when the test comes he said every famous picture must first go through the Hall of critics before it can be hung in a Hall of Fame and I tell you that's what the church has done today is went through the critics but one of these mornings God's going to hang her in a Hall of Fame out here just as sure as the world that same church is going to be called up one of these mornings hung in the Hall of Fame as she cuts through the air Yonder and doors and door he said see it's like the church has to pass through the Hall of critics you're going to be called Holy Roller you're going to be called Everything But If You Could Only Hold Your Position in Christ and someday he'll take us to the Hall of Fame but first we've got to stand criticism there is where the littleness of us stand there is where it shows he that cannot stand chastisement is an illegitimate child and not a child of God no matter how much he's joined church and whatever he's done he is still if he cannot stand chastisement he's an illegitimate and he's not a real child of God but a real genuine child of God don't care what the world says everything else is secondary he's got his mind on Christ and that settles it now see that goes back to Hebrews 11 1 faith is the substance and if faith is based on the word that's all a Believer cares about not emotion not fear not all those other things not what the world cares about not what the the critics say about you at work or school you care about the word you care about pleasing God because that's the only thing that matters to you look he said whatever Christ says do he'll do it wherever the lamb goes they're with him wherever and then you see his appearing his presence and what he does he is always with his people his bride his courtinger mm-hmm and the revelation of Jesus Christ he said we get in it'll dig up the lives of the Great Men back there how they sacrificed you'll see how little you've done it makes me feel ashamed of myself sometimes how we have to have everything so easy and they had everything so hard wondered about Paul said in Hebrews 11 and sheepskins and goat skins tormented and Afflicted destitute what will our testimony stand up beside of theirs how will it be up beside of that and we have to have everything so nice foreign so by faith Abel offered unto able a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh Faith Abel had such a substance faith that he he was willing to he he was willing to forsake everything to do what God said he knew what it was that that he had he had to offer up a a lamb that it was blood he he it wasn't somebody something that he was taught or that he was educated into but it was something real to him that he knew the problem and brother I said in the ministry explained he said when Solomon's gift was recognized among the people that he was A Gifted Man that God was with Solomon everybody come from everywhere to see Solomon because he had a Divine gift that was in operation and it proved itself the Bible said God will testify of his gifts he always has he always will might be a lot of things said it wasn't right but God will testify of his gifts you don't believe the holy spirit is a gift of God let it come on you one time God will testify of his gifts God will testify of somebody that's got a real Revelation it's going to Bear forth fruit it's going to manifest itself and then it says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him and we're going to end on this but you think about what brother Brown said that at the end of the road Enoch turned back and he said I've done everything that you require me to do and everything that God required him to do he did by faith now you think about that you can look back through your life and say that I've done everything when you come to the end of the journey if if you truly have and you can say that you asked me to go down into the water and be baptized and I did it by faith you told me I needed to be born again and I did it by faith you told me I needed to grow up on the stature of a perfect man and I I read and I understood the quotes and the Word was revealed to me and I did it by faith and you can say well I like Enoch could look back in his life I've done everything that you require to me when you can say that that word has been opened up and we're adopted and you know whether or not that is true in your life it's got to be true to somebody somebody's got a somebody's got to look back and say I've done everything that you required we've eaten the we've eaten the body word of Christ and we've eaten it until until we've come to a faith and but by faith that's the only way that you can please God Is by Faith by faith in his word his word is what is transforming us his word is what is giving us power his word is giving us overcoming power again against the devil and if you come to God you've got to believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that but trust in his word and Trust in his word and believe believe in his word because his faith faith is trusting what God Said and we'll stop right there foreign
