========================================

[Music] okay ready yeah let's pray everybody normally probably thank you for that skips guys are they in your name or for services in the Sun that's cool prayers blesses everything that's done materially help us teach in the Senate school no sources upstairs we'll just nothing ministers that's just be nice to hear understanding the words that come forth I pray one straighten out one thing the last time I have taught two lessons last time back-to-back and I had said I was gonna be arrogant and about something I was arrogant I think about a lot of things okay all right it sounded like it anyway but on that second lesson grab the start of it I was specifically a lot of 15 minutes for talking about mine and Gabby's marriage and about dreams that EULA had and so forth and I felt like that was being arrogant but all I simply doing is trying to show y'all how that you put Christ in your marriage and God will bless you for it and that's all that I took those dreams to me not have not many anything I was just assuming that the Lord was telling us I'm pleased with what you're doing okay it's all I was trying to say I wasn't trying to brag but anything we've done I hope taken that way but later this lesson I'll try to get back into that topic about marriage and putting Christ in your marriage and starting to make more sense because I believe in sick and gone in every facet of your life every single thing and you're individually and together in your marriage and on your job and wherever you're able to think about the Lord meditate pray and read your Bible and so forth so I just want to set that straight cuz I didn't feel right about that other thing if I talk about fish sticks anybody ever seen a fish stick and its natural habitat I mean you read it for I'll read it down a little fine frame over the bent stick pipefish occurs in marine waters throughout much of Indo West Pacific in Australia is known from the central coast of Western Australia around the tropical north and south to central New South Wales the bent stick pipefish has a long snout and a head that projects at a slight angle to the body its coloration is variable from yellow to brown red or black also commonly called the stick fish these I'm sorry the thick the fish stick these creatures are captured battered and fried it can be typically found in the frozen section of supermarkets this is going down it's only showing like they're doing yeah what's that Becky Becky caller always run around with Rebecca one Thank You Colin and we're both the same thing or that from Becky burn anyway the little colleagues browser we have got a still too heavy to money I mean you know she was she I'm gonna throw progress autofill what about technology and this was a Christmas gift so sorry I remember we talking a few years ago about sheep right learned another lesson about sheep this time a little bit more in depth okay the reason for that little story was to show you how cool we are okay like sheep and I want to believe that story I know some of y'all caught on to it but I would have believed it is I'm told me that there is such a thing as a fish stick swimming in the ocean but actually there's a processed white fish meat and so for that thing I'm leather you know alright so all we like sheep have gone astray the title is the west part that going astray as they have 53 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all psalm 119 176 I've gone astray like a lost sheep seek thy servants rod do not forget thy Commandments so the objective is to better understand the Sheep like nature we have as humans and to recognize that we have a tendency to go astray I'm gonna put up some definitions for y'all because I know I'm going to step on some toes and I'm not leaning and calling by stupid but actually there's there's a good definition here a minute about stupid what it really means and in Scripture we're locking on a sheet this is our sheep like that and results in a great need for a Shepherd the goddess okay stupid is having or showing great lack of intelligence which is a kind of derogatory way to use it or common sense and I'm talking about the common sense part all right so use that word in this lesson I'm not calling anybody stupid like in the derogatory sense intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills we all have that right we know we have that and we're not lacking that so we're not stupid in that sense we have the ability to acquire knowledge and skill that's why we're here we're learning about the Lord and we're growing like humans sheep are actually intelligent however due to their instincts they can easily be led astray right ignorant means liking knowledge or awareness in general uneducated or unsophisticated and poor Christian that's actually a good place to be in directions in a good position if you are an educated unsophisticated but if you're already obtained if you know I mean I have a little bit of college education and I have to actually try to suppress that some time because I get to this know-it-all mentality this intellectual mentality and that's not the way to approach God alright my next lesson is gonna be about humility I'm talking about how we approach God in humility and in the humble way okay so just laying some of these things out there I'm not calling anybody dumb alright just I just really want everybody recognize how bad we need a shepherd a fivefold ministry we need the Holy Ghost to guide us and direct us okay and the better the sooner we can recognize that better all right so there is no such thing as being too dumb to understand the mysteries of God he reveals them to babes to the uneducated the unsophisticated the simple and the humble that will tell you to dumb them tell me that it's not too hard or too complex to understand we simply need to read listen and pray then trust God to bring the understanding the revelation okay and I'll play a little bit of a tape if this technology will work I already forget that speaker over there to work so I had to bring something else there's $1 for long because this is a lengthy quote so that's why my brother Brennan traded to us from the unveiling of God it's all you know the older Hart sisters it was in that day doors they asked to stay away from it now are you behind the word it was C the Word of God is not far off its nightly the Bob says he's in thy heart and my mouth the Word of Faith which we preach right Romans 10:8 he's trying to reveal himself it's us that's lacking because we're not studying in framix he can go to like we showed he's here he's very prevalent and very available to us right and brother said he had blasting himself right out as bright as the Sun not trying to hide himself he hide himself from the wise and prudent but to us he's trying to reveal if we'll make ourselves available who humble ourselves okay that's going amen God University and tight hose is coming from the presence of God with the Word of God for that age watching we're not Exodus 19 miss this mountain Exodus 19 Moses is kind of the presence of God into the word the worst mineral idea the presence of God with the word he had the word for the age there's a word for a change hey all just coming forth his face shine so you get out to the people the true word got it rolled it and was ready to be benefit he was the word today he was a living worth it healed himself Moses had to put a veil over his own face he was that was that just give up something to think about she instinctively follow the lead sheep and their flaw hey I looked all this up on Wikipedia if you want to verify some of this similar to our instinct the Adamic nature okay sometimes that leader can be just the first sheep that moves to another location you know she just followed that instinct it's so ingrained in them that they can actually like the grass they're eating they can getting fat good food and then all of a sudden they have the flock just sort of migrate or whatever you call it over to another part of the field say over there and this there's one shakes like willing like this food all along because it's so instinctive he's not really thinking about it it's just an instinct however she often followed the oldest mother which is called the you dance I pronounced that in the flaw so lucky you if you notice you is like half the letter off from being Eve humans do the same thing we tend to follow our mother Eve you know our that that nature that raising on the Word of God instead of letting God reveal it to you I like the denominational churches following the mother or you know the daughter harlots following the mother floor and so forth we tend to follow the old mother and we do that this just by our nature it's our instinct if you will that's part of us that we have to overcome no brother BAM I'm saying hiding behind something simplicity para flinch was because the man was made up in the beginning not to try to shift for himself a man was made to rely completely upon God that's the reason we're liking under Lambs of sheep a sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and the Holy Spirit is supposed to lead us so man has made that way brother that was always talking about how that God made things how he wanted her in the Garden of Eden if you want to know how God wants something you look back to the patterns of the original and you know how I want it and in the end beginning in the garden he made man brother Graham said with that nature he made man with this part of him that he needs a shepherd he needs to be led right but will follow the other leading fall the wrong leading if we're not careful we'll go off on her own way especially if we choose not to follow anybody well we're off on our own way but you do not follow a pastor or whatever kind of try to hurry through some of these because it's a long lesson and sheep we have a natural tendency to go astray from common sense and sound doctrine when one dares talk about these lists of things here just mostly natural examples to show you how stupid we really are and a lot of things a lot I'm not teaching about finances of parenting and driving I'm just going to show you how doubly stupid whatever you want to call us in that in those things of life if we don't seek the coach or a wisdom you know we're not going to counsel or whatever about some of those things from the time that financially just for a moment they remedy you're all familiar with him I think what this man and I agree with him I appreciate him not condemning anything he does because he self not watching out a lot but what he does if you really think about it at its root this man is making money off of telling people to bounce their checkbook you shouldn't have to be talkative that or tell people to live below what they make you should have to be told a thing that he always said I teach you what your grandma taught you but I keep my teeth then all I'm doing is saying this is what's supposed to do you know it not going to do it right so he's doing a shepherd in that regard and these are selling in slogans calling cents is not really that common common sense is so uncommon that it is now deemed a superpower all we like sheep have gone astray even in our finances we just go just do what feels right just do it feels good borrow a car here's and make little but spend a whole lot and wonder why we're having problems parenting modern parents typically do not spank their children because they consider that to be abuse if I'm also most talking about here implement like in the world you go to Walmart and stuff and people are begging their children to try to suffice um you know say we just give them a good banging proverbs 13:24 he that spareth his rod hateth the Sun but he that loveth Sam chasing us in The Times these are the guidelines in the Bible about raising children all verbs 2313 withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die I was 26 train up a child we should go and then he's old enough apart from it but all we like sheep have gone astray we just go do what feels right maybe maybe the maybe Junior will behave a little better if I try the a surprise notice come in spanking and then rewarding when he does good you know I'm not an expert parent I'm just trying to you know driving all right eyebrow 4:11 and watch a lot of people actually I don't drive as much as I do just watch people because it's not that far to stay in between the lines it's hard to not hit someone because everyone likes to plant their car in front of a tractor trailer often more than you would think or front of whatever vehicle you drive you don't know what happens there's a couple of basic principles in driving that I'm going to discuss with you that are often neglected and we know to do these things everybody knows the three-second rule what everybody knows to keep a good phone just even if you don't count to three I don't I just stay really far away from people they get on the brakes and I can't stop in time I'm too close you know so just follow far away and you'll be all right and the speed limit commonly broken now and those too low let's see those broken very often and I say wrecks were little from and I see maybe a couple of wrecks a week on average I do I saw one wreck like this several years ago after our first turn of driving I was coming up 62 four-lane divided highway now Ronald Thompson Bridge Road all right right on Thompson bridge and there was a convoy of cars like this pass to me because I'm a big stinky chicken truck Ron spiel and they're all mine mr. Pat over to get around that's okay the one in front decided to stop really hard because of a little piece of plastic and rope kind of dumb but that's okay it would have been alright if the others were not following some clothes the problem was that that one was being followed very close by three or four the car my window was down as it was hot and I heard these cars as they are I'm not any smarter than them I'm just trying to follow good and sound advice and instruction and on phone calls so they all probably thought well it's this guy's fault really you're not gonna fall closer whatever several things we just lets go astray all we like sheep have gone astray we did what everybody else does doesn't matter to make sense or not don't even have credible thought we just do it because every bus is demand and your finances and your drive and your parenting just you try whatever bail to us know what it is it's there we have this one little speed zone over by our house now that construction is on it's 35 years big 55 every single time got their their car on my bumper tanker trucks gas tankers past me in the dope in the in the center growling I don't do that anymore you know say all of those speed limits like it's a limit you know a lot of people take the speed limits that well that's a good starting point let's go up from there let's build on man yeah I'm with ya suggestion yeah this is yes okay this is not so much about what you do for a career this is about you know putting on in your career choice when you choose what you're going to do and yeah and hang about there I made a big mistake over this career several years ago I had a trial and a test and I fell but we went back you made it right and our career choices we often lose sight of what our real goals should be in life we strive for the best paid jobs and all facility cetera how the job will affect our relationship with Laura we should strongly consider whether career choice will cause us to miss church or take away time from the Lord this is another area where we like sheep go astray all right real quick my little testimony about that so about 10 or 11 years ago me about 11 years ago we were engaged and I was interested in a job where I could keep her at home I have a strong conviction about that because what brother Brennan said that I want my wife at home and at the same time I have a scripture that says I need to be in church now these two things we need to be in church so I came worked so much that I have to miss church I'm into work enough to keep her at home at the time I dog was not big enough evidently to fulfill both those needs because I said well my boss that way if you want to drive and he was all for me the dog and ask him he said if you have this crowded up but if you're gonna drive you gotta miss church some I should have said no if you want me in the job you make it to run off to miss church but I let my bar my guard down because I wanted to fulfill this part which was all right keep my wife at home that's that's good and honorable but I thought well God can't do both you're not big enough Lord so I'll just go ahead and forget that scripture for a little while well eight years I did that we missed half the windsor night services for eight years because i was having to work late every wednesday almost or every other wednesday finally had this terrible conviction of my heart and i really hated that my phone worked out my boss for three years now i'm not mr. Salem Wednesday night because I simply went to not shift you know we worked it out and you know the Lord blessed us and helped us in that but saying what I have done to let my guard down for that little while and just simply fail the test you know and kept trying won't work it out you know and he I kept getting the sense that you know you got yourself into this you get yourself back out I just made a mess because I was simply trying to fulfill two things and didn't think God was big enough to to fulfill both those leaders okay all right one of the attributes of Satan's Kingdom is busyness I don't mean the work in general business I mean busyness and many scriptures say this depicted is wandering to and fro restless fearful striving totally worried Christ gives us peace that passes understanding a firm foundation promise of a future and expected in Jeremiah 29:11 rest contentment fulfillment Joe etc few scriptures on that so y'all know the parable of the sower of the seed of the Sun so the seed and nineteen thirteen eighteen here you therefore the parable is so you know all the different things others skip down to this part he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth or and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful okay so the business of the chores and things around the house and doing things in the yard and whatever else you got to do that you think it's so important but I think it's something where this is the biggest conflict in my life really for most of the time is this the biggest damn struggle with its trying to put God first around the house not do all the tour's first because the tour firm necessary sometimes need to be done but I'm a perfectionist and try to do just exactly perfect and if I don't have to always be perfect but the problem comes when I thought read my Bible and pray over me and Gabby don't read and pray together until after all well then I'll run out of time so the thing the thing to do is to cook trucks first always and this is a very difficult thing is easier said than done thus the apex of Satan in the apex of Satan's even we tend to succumb to these same attributes by setting our sights on the wrong goal even in our household duties we can easily become distracted like Martha being careful about anything let's read that Luke 10 but Martha was cumbered about much serving Martha wasn't in a honky-tonk or a marshal or anything and really wrong she was serving right doing a good thing good deed and came to him and said Lord dost thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone bettered therefore that she help me and jesus answered and said unto her Martha Martha they are careful and troubled about many things he did to say you know you're deep in sin you need to know we're pandering thing he just said you're troubled and careful about many things but one thing is needful and Mary have chosen that good part you remember what she was doing just in the feet of Jesus and she was having communion if she was just hearing the Word of God and she no doubt wanted to go he'll probably yearning to go help Martha and do all these chores you know but yet she was living to put that down for in just a minute and go listen to the Lord put it now for just a minute and go listen to the sermon this is our little tiny speaker there twice turning on in her house and you know you can do that while you're doing chores actually you only live another long go through that sure and Mary have chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her I look too young remember of course tears was in the temple to spewing the word with the Pharisee and so forth at 12 years old well they call about the age of accountability recognizing who he is and mines here he said I must be about my father's business and that's what we need to say we must see you've found father's business we tend to put like these little chores and the little things we do around the house and work and so forth right on par with operating in prayer and it's not just another thing to do this should be up here and then the other things are down here that are so temporal okay it's not that these are not important for now those things are important but nothing in comparison to reading the word and pray and study meditating Hebrews 12 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before Matthew 6 lay down for yourself treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and still volectro so treasure in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not great Civic still where your treasure are there will your heart be also be careful not to get distracted and Satan Satan with all the cares of life get much time to God and then marriage talk a little bit about it long ago brother Brown said a lot of things about marriage and about you know basically they talk about Adam and Eve in the garden with the Lord right having communion and if you look up in the cool of the day that's where I found this in the cool of the day if you look that up you find several books about this now in the beginning when God came down the evening and talked to Adam and Eve and the cool of the day and there's great voice whispered to them and they have fellowship love one another now or how the moving of the Spirit went through the bushes the lines came up the Tigers all of them and they worship the Lord man was conscious at all times that his presence was with them they had oneness you know they had a unity and that's what you can experience if you and your spouse if you're able to die no matter if eyes they would do that but if your spouse will sit down after me and talk about the Lord together fellowship read and pray together listen to sermons together and individually that's not to replace the individual quiet time a traditional wedding ceremony takes place in a church sanctuary before Wow before a preacher and in the presence of both God and man presumably the couple being married adhere to this tradition because it is our for God to bless their marriage you would think that when people above the altar that for a wedding ceremony right now obviously the reason they're doing that having this traditional things because in the presence of God man because they want a blessing on their man so with God to make their marriage fruitful or else I just fall in tradition which ever make the last thing a fruitful a holy matrimony which nominal holy means like sanctified means consecrated to God it means God is in it basically what I'm saying however though maybe Christians happen they felt to seek God collectively in their marriage now I'm not be Christian as anybody not saying they're not Christians you can both be and do your individual quiet time but just forget to come together and do that together with you in the Lord and there's a great blessing in that there really is all right this is yet another way we like sheep go straight after the wedding a true holy matrimony should have not gone into the marriage and into the hunt their daily bar reading and prayer talking about the Lord listens phones etc spend time together with the Lord and then the last thing is this we're going to go into our part two next week because I'm out of time with pretty much the Christian life this is the most important thing when I get to like halfway through this lesson so if we're not careful we can go straight even on our Christian experience saving Peter 3:17 a therefore beloved seeing you know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness we're not immune okay we have to keep keep steady going this is a race we're running still second Peter 2 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that bought down and bring upon themselves Swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious way a reason affirmed the way of truth shall be evil spoken of you know people really do speak evil the message in general you know the world speaks evil with us but there's even folks within the message that speak evil of this church and our pastor and so forth they don't understand first Peter 2:25 for you are a sheep going astray but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your soul Holy Spirit now I'm gonna play a little game with y'all I think this is this is a little game called name that preacher I've got a quote here from one of our five ministers in this church I'm going to start trying to do this in some of my listeners I want to read the quote to you it's very profound the reason for doing this is because of one sec scripture probably did not without honor in his own country and among his own kin mark six for you say well brother Del's my you know kinfolk or it's just brother Dale's just growing legs just brother Bob you know what long to God I know we don't really come right up and say it but in our heart we really think it by our actions we prove because we don't go back and hear these sermons my conviction is that we should listen to these men the tapes hear over and over and over until we really understand because you don't get it I don't understand I don't get it just sitting in the service that's right distraction is leaving us and so forth kids and whatnot all right this is a really good quote from our pastor I want y'all to say that God is in our thoughtful ministry that's how I'm doing this okay he is really here what about the constant listening to the word and letting the word clean you out now who do you think said that one of the five ministers here how good guess wait just like it's brother nail that was on 1:7 that a.m. service the sermon was salvation Guaymas would be born again I put a timestamp reading find that an hour twenty five minutes into the service what about the constant listen to the word and let the word clean you out y'all believe that that's a constant thing it's not my life put in my duty I listen to once around the dam okay listeners means you have time for a minute you can make time for brother Dale this was rather dealt in his reference to Jesus convert Jesus conversation with Nicodemus you know he was trying to explain with the new birth is to Nicodemus releve oldest right no that just says what about the constant listing of the word Hebrew six twelve that she'd be not slothful but followers of them through faith and patience inherit the promises this is me and I have witnessed our fivefold ministers inherit the promise of the new birth thus I follow them I see what they're doing brother Dale stands up often not bragging I've never took it as bragging these things up and says I used to listen to two types of a and read six books I take that if my pastor tell me how he got in such a progressed level the revelations so close with the Lord I want to be in there too this was the path I follow right respective persons if brother nailed up there that way I'll get there that way so that you be not slothful questions you need to study them the followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises God keeps his word brother Branham say us oh this is one brother never make reference to a couple weeks ago in his sermon but you go into a place where I pass through the solid gospel teacher my gosh all hell will never move that church really strong flow do the processing yesterday today forever it works so much greater in foreign countries that then it doesn't American because we have been so and documented with different teachings so forth so many times we've failed to get the real power of the gospel out of the gospel because we're trying to make it so complicated and to see how simple it is we missed it by that way how many more minutes I got David good ok so we go about real people time I want sure if you're going back I'm really late well that one said it's like three more minutes he only got three minutes okay alright nevermind oh come on give us five minutes yeah he's got having so simplicity we expect it to be some great something we missed the simple thing we stumble over simplicity the Salamis college by strolling over simplicity God is so simple until the scholars of these days and all days miss him a million miles because in their intellects they know that there's nothing like him so great buddy in his revelation he makes it so simple you find yourself not in revelation that's gone not there with you as much as you would like this is not his fault it is not slack concerning his promise he's like a paper three now we'll pick up there the next time [Music]
