[7:17] by the scripture not using quotes
[7:22] by the bible
[7:24] and by the church history to prove that
[7:26] there was no baptism
[7:29] except the name of the lord jesus christ
[7:31] until about 300 or 400 a.d when the
[7:33] catholic church instituted the father
[7:36] son holy ghost baptism all right so

[14:45] of the morales children and we had the
[14:47] youngest here the other day and she was

[14:50] baptized so we're going to work on that
[14:52] middle one though we're going to work on
[14:53] jasmine
[14:54] so uh the lord's moving
[14:58] the lord's moving i can see it in
[14:59] different in other churches and i can
[15:00] see it in people this world wants god
[15:05] so let me read you this quote
[15:08] brother brown in a deep call to the deep
[15:10] 1952 he says lord jesus
[15:12] blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[15:14] after righteousness for they shall be
[15:15] filled
[15:16] now feel the longing and desire of every
[15:19] heart in here
[15:21] and make these christians who are called
[15:22] by your name
[15:24] you said the people that are called by
[15:26] my name shall assemble themselves
[15:27] together and pray and then i'll hear
[15:29] from heaven and heal the land
[15:32] he said they were the salt of the earth
[15:35] brother isaac now we're talking about
[15:36] he's talking about wanting to be salty
[15:38] so
[15:39] i pulled up this quote but if the salt
[15:41] has lost its savior it's henceforth good
[15:43] for nothing to be cast out tried under
[15:46] the foot of men now father we realize
[15:48] that salt is a savior if it's contacted
[15:50] if it contacts
[15:52] but there must be a contact a settling
[15:55] and now may the holy spirit that has
[15:56] given new birth to every one of these
[15:58] children of god by faith may they be so
[16:02] salty tonight in their faith that the
[16:04] unbeliever that might be sitting in here
[16:08] say oh that's the way that's the end
[16:11] that's the way i believe christianity
[16:13] and may they accept him
[16:15] and may the sick be healed the lost be
[16:17] saved and the backsliders reclaimed
[16:20] god be glorified
[16:22] be salty
[16:24] be salty it's got to come from you
[16:25] though the contact has got to come from
[16:28] you be salty
[16:29] [Applause]
[16:33] compel them to want what you got
[16:35] but you got to live it first
[16:37] amen
[16:38] that's why i said church is important
[16:42] coming together is important being a
[16:43] family is important being a church
[16:45] family is important it's important
[16:46] because who's going to divide us
[16:48] god will never divide us
[16:50] satan will always try to divide us amen
[16:53] so let's bow our heads we'll get can
[16:54] start on the sentiment son of man here
[16:56] just a second dear heavenly father thank
[16:58] you for this
[16:59] lovely day that you give us father
[17:01] we pray now that you sanctify us for
[17:02] this journey be with the people lord
[17:04] may we realize lord that you're working
[17:07] in a group of people
[17:08] because we're coming to an end
[17:10] we're coming to a revelation that's
[17:12] never been before a father to where
[17:14] death will have no dominion over us in
[17:17] the physical realm
[17:18] we know it still does lord as we were
[17:20] watching last night brother biscuit
[17:21] there in his late 80s and we can see the
[17:24] toils of life
[17:26] and all this that's
[17:27] messing with his mind and messing with
[17:29] his body and it's just the sin curse
[17:32] being made manifest
[17:34] but father inside of that man
[17:36] is a soul
[17:38] and that soul i believe has the new
[17:40] birth and this is just as eternal as god
[17:42] is
[17:43] and satan is looking at the outside but
[17:45] lord jesus may we today look at the
[17:47] inside
[17:48] may we know that our inside is right
[17:52] and then like the prophet said be salty
[17:54] and display it on the outside
[17:56] father forgive us of our sins and bless
[17:58] this day lord be with the ones that are
[17:59] sick
[18:00] ones that are not with us ones that are
[18:01] traveling give them traveling mercies
[18:04] lord and bless each one lord that's on
[18:05] the prayer list that we pray for the
[18:07] ones down below my feet for salvation
[18:09] lord i pray bring them in father
[18:12] bring them in under the correct way
[18:15] which is water baptism in the name of
[18:16] the lord jesus christ and receiving the
[18:19] holy ghost in their soul not just on
[18:21] their spirit
[18:22] father we pray that you just please lord
[18:25] be the active participant in this
[18:26] service father we give it to you in
[18:28] jesus name
[18:30] amen
[18:31] who is this son of man part number 40.
[18:34] in the beginning was the word and where
[18:36] it was with god in the word was god and
[18:37] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[18:39] us and we behold his glory the glory of
[18:41] the only begotten of the father
[18:43] full of grace and truth now that's
[18:45] that's what john saw that because this
[18:47] is john
[18:48] this is john the revelator this is one
[18:49] of the disciples
[18:51] john we beheld his glory we saw him
[18:54] there we knew who he was the glory is
[18:56] the only begotten of the father and they
[18:58] weren't confused in their baptism
[19:00] they weren't confused in their
[19:02] trinitarianism they knew who that man
[19:04] was especially when on the day of
[19:06] pentecost they knew exactly who he was
[19:09] and where he went
[19:10] he went in them so you may be seated in
[19:12] the lord as blessing to the reading of
[19:14] the word we'll talk about a little bit
[19:15] this afternoon now i want you to
[19:17] understand one thing water baptism does
[19:19] not save your soul
[19:25] never has
[19:26] never will
[19:28] because the saving of your soul is the
[19:30] atonement that was at calvary
[19:33] it was the giving of a life
[19:35] but to start your christian journey you
[19:38] must start correct
[19:40] and we'll talk about this afternoon god
[19:42] started his church on the day of
[19:43] pentecost and he wants it to end the
[19:44] same way if he started with baptism in
[19:46] the name lord jesus christ he's going to
[19:48] have to end up in the baptism in the
[19:49] name of the lord jesus christ amen
[19:52] so we'll get to that this afternoon but
[19:54] i was compelled i was out in my
[19:57] out in the garden working
[19:59] and
[20:03] one of those fits hit
[20:04] me just on water baptism you say water
[20:07] baptism we've been in mexico 50 years
[20:09] what about water baptism
[20:11] i just got to thinking
[20:13] the institution of that
[20:15] john
[20:16] baptized jesus
[20:19] and then you come on up and you see the
[20:21] water baptism it is extremely important
[20:25] extremely important and it's extremely
[20:27] extremely important to be baptized the
[20:29] correct way and i think people are
[20:31] seeing that more now that there's got to
[20:33] be a name involved
[20:35] just like here where there's got to be a
[20:37] name this now remember the son of man
[20:39] you can't we're not going to baptize
[20:41] today in the day in the name of the son
[20:42] of man even though jesus christ is the
[20:44] son of man
[20:46] that is a title and we'll get into that
[20:48] i looked up the a definition of of name
[20:51] and title
[20:53] it says a title is something attached to
[20:55] but a name is a person
[20:57] all right so we want the person of god
[20:59] we don't want the title
[21:01] we don't want to be baptized in the name
[21:02] of the son of man but to baptize in the
[21:04] name of the son of man you can do that
[21:08] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[21:10] that's why matthew 28 19 there's no
[21:12] doing away with that that's the only way
[21:14] you can baptize it's in the name of the
[21:16] father and of the son and of the holy
[21:17] ghost and that is the lord jesus christ
[21:19] so we don't we're the only ones that
[21:21] have the christian baptism correct
[21:24] in this whole world they're all deceived
[21:27] sorry
[21:29] so listen also we're predestinated to
[21:31] adoption we're not predestinated just to
[21:32] come to church and live a good life and
[21:34] though that's wonderful
[21:36] but we've come to a place to where we
[21:38] have to live
[21:40] and make this thing manifest
[21:42] because we were talking yesterday
[21:44] you know it's good to be a christian and
[21:46] wonderful to be a christian but to get
[21:48] more of god
[21:50] to get more of god who all wants more of
[21:53] god today we all want more of god to get
[21:55] more of god you've got to grow
[21:57] to get more out of life you've got to
[21:59] grow
[22:02] so it's not your birth your birth has to
[22:04] get you here
[22:06] but when that birth gets you here then
[22:08] we have to have what tutors and
[22:10] governors we have to have people that
[22:11] teach us and train us but now remember
[22:14] the bible tells us later on that we
[22:16] don't have need of teachers anymore well
[22:17] now by the way that's good then we'll
[22:19] just all set home we won't get it all
[22:20] ourselves that's not what that means
[22:22] that means that tutor don't have to
[22:24] teach you how to walk anymore that tutor
[22:26] don't have to teach you to go from milk
[22:28] to meat no you're standing on your own
[22:30] do you know today i'm just going to
[22:31] speak to you today but the revelation
[22:33] has got to come from god that's inside
[22:35] of you not from this teacher
[22:38] it's got to come from you
[22:41] what's inside of you has got to speak
[22:43] back
[22:44] and say that ain't nothing but the truth
[22:47] so that's where it's coming from
[22:48] everybody's wanting to hang on people's
[22:49] words yeah let's hang on people's words
[22:52] let's hang on the words of the son of
[22:53] man
[22:55] amen as long as we preach the gospel and
[22:57] preach the message of the hour i believe
[22:59] we're preaching the son of man
[23:02] so it's not your birth
[23:04] brother bob was talking about this
[23:05] morning
[23:06] you can have the baptism of the holy
[23:07] ghost every day of your life on your
[23:10] flesh you know in your spirit realm
[23:11] that'll make you go to church and make
[23:13] you do emotional things that's why i
[23:15] said about justification that's a hard
[23:17] place to stay because that's what satan
[23:19] will do he'll make you laxadaisical
[23:21] he'll say you've got feelings emotions
[23:24] you read you study
[23:26] no somewhere down the line you're going
[23:28] to fall off
[23:29] that's what's happening now
[23:31] this is the day of manifestation of the
[23:33] sons of god well it's also going to
[23:35] manifest the sons of the devil too
[23:38] amen in the manifestation of the sons of
[23:40] god is going to be the manifestation of
[23:42] the sons of the devil and the seals
[23:44] being broken open what's the first thing
[23:46] happens
[23:47] the voice
[23:48] of that combat beast says come and see
[23:52] it's not the devil sitting there going
[23:54] i'm going to see this before you will
[23:56] know god is going to reveal it to us
[23:58] first
[23:59] and then the white horse rider will be
[24:01] what
[24:02] he'll have to leave
[24:04] just like these unclean spirits that's
[24:06] why i want you to fight i want you to
[24:07] pull i want you to do everything you can
[24:10] to get those unclean spirits out of you
[24:12] because they're wanting to come back
[24:13] they want to come back they want to come
[24:14] back drive them out
[24:21] listen we have enough fighting with
[24:23] fighting our own self
[24:25] amen
[24:26] everything good
[24:29] we
[24:30] good okay
[24:33] all right
[24:36] so now
[24:38] you don't have to pull the chart up
[24:40] because everybody knows where we're
[24:41] going with this we got that big wide
[24:42] foundation and you got to start on that
[24:44] big wide foundation right there and what
[24:46] is it it's called faith
[24:47] you got to start with faith but now
[24:49] watch we're going to read in just a few
[24:50] minutes though where the prophet of god
[24:52] says okay now that you're born again and
[24:53] you've got this light precious faith
[24:56] that alone is not going to do it
[24:59] so faith alone's not gonna do it you say
[25:00] well faith yes faith based is everything
[25:04] you gotta base it but you can't just say
[25:07] hey listen let me ask you a question how
[25:09] many have you seen jesus die on the
[25:10] cross not one of you
[25:12] physically saw him
[25:14] but in your heart you have that person
[25:17] inside of you so he is revealing that to
[25:19] you and you have faith but then you got
[25:22] to add to that faith
[25:24] because when we get to virtue when we
[25:26] get to the virtues maybe on wednesday
[25:29] night when we get to the virtues that
[25:31] virtue is strength that's something that
[25:33] god is going to give you and then you're
[25:35] not going to hold on to it you're going
[25:36] to give it back out
[25:39] jesus didn't hold on to his virtue
[25:41] he gave it out all the time the woman
[25:43] touched his garment the different things
[25:44] he healed the sick raised the dead he
[25:47] virtue was flowing from him
[25:49] and that's what you and i are going to
[25:50] have to come to where virtue where you
[25:53] can
[25:53] as we were talking even last night and
[25:55] we talk about life a little bit and then
[25:57] we talk about the lord and i'm talking
[25:59] about when we're outside there's a place
[26:02] though that we all connect under one
[26:04] thing and that's the baptism of the holy
[26:05] ghost the new birth
[26:07] in our life
[26:10] helping our life to change because like
[26:12] i said before we live
[26:14] a human being 90 of the time
[26:19] all right 99
[26:20] percent of the time we live a human
[26:22] being
[26:23] all right god gets about ten percent
[26:25] maybe that's let's do 90 and 10. that'll
[26:27] get in in the scriptures we give him ten
[26:29] percent of our time do we
[26:31] give him ten percent of our time
[26:34] figure that out
[26:37] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[26:38] god they are the sons of god and that's
[26:40] what we've seen we've seen the spirit of
[26:42] god move as i was watching brother
[26:43] biscuit last night at his 50th
[26:45] anniversary
[26:46] he was explaining about a healing that
[26:48] had come because of the bypasses and i
[26:50] thought
[26:50] man when i met that brother in 20 what
[26:53] was it oh six when he came down here in
[26:55] in gainesville and he had his um
[26:58] he brought we had a um a convention
[27:00] there and he brought all his people down
[27:02] from from bible way just about it you
[27:04] know and they kind of like we are now
[27:06] they kind of got everything all set up
[27:07] and i thought man what a vibrant man
[27:10] well now you look at him and
[27:13] he can hardly speak
[27:16] that's the fall
[27:19] but that's a paradox too because i can
[27:21] look at him through my eyes and see a
[27:23] revelation
[27:24] that satan can't see
[27:26] satan sees a man fixing to go to the
[27:27] grave if the body change doesn't happen
[27:29] but i see a man that's already been
[27:31] changed
[27:31] i said man it's already eternal i see a
[27:34] man that's already 20 years old i see a
[27:36] man that's going to be able to preach we
[27:38] were talking about last night preaching
[27:40] yeah i believe we'll preach in the in in
[27:42] the millennium and in the future home
[27:43] and all the different things because
[27:44] there's a message of cheer down through
[27:46] the endless ages there's a lot of people
[27:48] going to be given eternal life that
[27:49] didn't even know that jesus existed on
[27:51] earth
[27:52] and you're going to be able to
[27:53] gloriously sit with him for just
[27:55] millions of years and just expound on
[27:57] everything you know about god
[27:59] and how he saved your soul yes
[28:01] that is if you got saved
[28:04] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[28:06] god they are not going to be they are
[28:08] the sons of god so when you receive the
[28:10] new birth that we're talking about now
[28:12] then you are a son and daughter of god
[28:14] cannot be taken away from that that's
[28:17] right
[28:18] for you have not received the spirit of
[28:19] bondage again to fear but you have
[28:20] received
[28:22] the spirit of adoption whereby we cry
[28:25] out by father or daddy daddy
[28:27] the spirit itself bear witness with our
[28:29] spirit that we are the children of god
[28:32] and if children okay children if
[28:35] children then heirs to what
[28:38] add to your faith virtue knowledge
[28:40] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[28:42] kindness and the capstone which is love
[28:45] there's a new song out i don't know who
[28:47] it's by but it's some
[28:49] it's on a contemporary station
[28:51] christian station
[28:52] and it talks about love is all we need
[28:55] the love that they project is not all we
[28:58] need
[29:00] because if without the new birth it's
[29:01] only feel your love it'll take you to a
[29:04] perversion every single time that's why
[29:07] you see now and you say you say what do
[29:09] you mean well you look at these people
[29:10] falling away from the message what are
[29:11] they falling for a perversion
[29:13] there's a perverse spirit that's driving
[29:16] them away from the truth
[29:19] they just don't realize it
[29:21] because they got the new birth they got
[29:22] the holy ghost on their
[29:24] spirit and not in their soul
[29:27] but now if we become children
[29:30] you got to know today whether you're a
[29:32] child of god or not
[29:34] a child of god is led by the spirit of
[29:37] god and we are joint heirs with christ
[29:40] or whatever christ gets that's why
[29:42] brother brown could stand and say she is
[29:43] him
[29:44] because whatever we read the scripture
[29:47] about jesus is talking about you
[29:49] amen can you believe that
[29:51] then
[29:52] john 1 1. in the beginning was the word
[29:54] words with god and word was god and the
[29:56] word was made flesh
[29:58] in 2022 and dwelt among us
[30:02] folks this god dwelling here
[30:04] he decided this he decided to put
[30:06] everything he had on a bride
[30:08] he didn't put it on an angel he didn't
[30:10] put it on the devil he put it on a bride
[30:13] he put it on god and human flesh inside
[30:16] of a group of people
[30:18] that's what he decided so i'm just going
[30:19] to follow the plan
[30:22] and if children then heirs the heirs of
[30:23] god and join heirs with christ if so be
[30:25] that we suffer with him
[30:27] that we may be what glorified
[30:30] together now we were talking about
[30:32] justification
[30:36] i was
[30:37] listening to a brother
[30:40] a young a man testifying the other day
[30:43] and he'd been listening to the message
[30:45] and
[30:46] kind of a new convert
[30:50] he said i've been fooled
[30:53] i've been fooled
[30:55] i've been fooled into believing i was a
[30:57] christian
[30:58] i've been fooled into believing that
[31:00] everything i did was right
[31:02] i've been fooled
[31:05] i thank god for that
[31:08] if you don't know your food
[31:11] you're gonna stay in what you got
[31:14] and brother and and god said he'd give
[31:16] you a strong delusion and let you
[31:17] believe the lie
[31:19] the lie and be damned by it but no
[31:22] that's okay
[31:23] that's why i said i like ignorance but
[31:26] ignorance becomes stupidity when you
[31:28] continue in ignorance for so long
[31:30] and man it's not bad to be ignorant it's
[31:32] just you don't know but once light has
[31:35] shined on it now see you take somebody
[31:37] like the brother you take somebody like
[31:38] somebody you've testified to or that
[31:40] you've brought into the message of the
[31:42] hour you present it to them
[31:44] and then you just kind of back off
[31:46] because then what's going to happen is
[31:47] if there's something inside of them
[31:50] a desire to do better he's they're going
[31:52] to come back to you and say tell me some
[31:53] more
[31:55] amen it's kind of what happened with
[31:56] brother dale with brother mo you know
[31:57] they started riding with each other
[31:58] southern general motors and brother moat
[32:00] was playing the tapes and brother dale
[32:02] was like what is this who is this guy
[32:03] and then back and forth and back and
[32:05] forth and all of a sudden he says tell
[32:06] me more
[32:08] tell me more
[32:10] now there's some that we're going to
[32:11] testify to that say don't tell me no
[32:13] more
[32:15] amen we've met those where they go in a
[32:17] totally opposite direction
[32:19] well that's okay not everybody this is
[32:21] not for everybody when i mean the
[32:22] message of the hour i mean
[32:24] the true
[32:25] christian walk
[32:28] amen
[32:29] listen folks i'll get to it just a
[32:30] minute but i'm going to tell you now
[32:33] moses brought a message
[32:38] to himself
[32:40] no it wasn't for moses
[32:46] nope
[32:47] moses go up on the mountain
[32:50] moses go up on the mountain and i'll
[32:51] meet you up there and i'm going to write
[32:53] 10 things on a piece of paper or i mean
[32:56] a piece of stone
[32:58] and you're gonna take those and you're
[33:00] just gonna stay up there and it's all
[33:02] yours
[33:04] he said take what i said go down there
[33:06] and give it to the people
[33:10] that's what brother branham did
[33:13] prophet of god go back into my mind
[33:17] get these mysteries
[33:20] and bring them and give them to my
[33:22] people
[33:23] not keep it for yourself give it to the
[33:26] people moses comes down he gives it to
[33:28] the people oh he gets mad throws them
[33:30] down he goes back again but what did
[33:32] moses he said moses whatever you saw
[33:36] remember brother brown said he went into
[33:37] heaven
[33:39] and got the tabernacle saw jesus christ
[33:42] made a cat made the wrote about the
[33:44] tabernacle and brought it what and he
[33:45] give it to the
[33:46] people so the message of the hour is not
[33:49] william brown's message
[33:51] it's my message in your message
[33:55] and then whatever happens with that man
[33:58] that has nothing to do with me that's
[34:00] between him and god but he brought me
[34:02] the message of the hour which is that
[34:05] jesus christ is going to live in a bride
[34:08] and going to have full preeminence he's
[34:10] never had full preeminence
[34:13] since he left this earth 2000 years ago
[34:15] there's never been full preeminence
[34:17] there's always been a low of this and a
[34:18] low of that and a little the other a
[34:20] strand of this and a strand of that
[34:24] but then the prophet of god said
[34:26] my message is to tie up those loose ends
[34:29] take those loose strands
[34:31] and tie them back together
[34:32] so that god can work through a group of
[34:34] people
[34:35] not just work through him
[34:37] but work through a group of people
[34:39] what was he sent for for himself no he
[34:41] was sent for you and me he was sent for
[34:44] people
[34:47] same way with jesus christ he just i
[34:49] didn't come on my own court he said i
[34:50] came because of you
[34:53] you know what he did he come to save me
[34:54] i don't know if he can save you or not
[34:58] but he did come to save me
[35:01] romans 8 verse 10
[35:03] but what saith thee the word is nigh the
[35:05] even in thy mouth and in the heart that
[35:07] is the word of faith
[35:09] which we preach
[35:10] that thou shalt confess with the mouth
[35:12] the lord jesus and believe in thy heart
[35:14] that god hath raised him from the dead
[35:16] thou shalt be saved that's what we're
[35:18] talking about just for the for the
[35:20] visitors to back up a little bit we're
[35:21] talking about justification in its baby
[35:24] form
[35:25] this is not even in the body of christ
[35:27] yet this is just getting your chop your
[35:29] sins chopped off and being totally
[35:31] repentant i mean sorrowfully repentant
[35:34] not repentant because you got caught
[35:40] you repent because there's something
[35:41] inside of you said i need to change
[35:45] this is not going to work anymore
[35:47] that's why i always when i pray i said
[35:49] lord stir their water
[35:51] make them where they don't sleep at
[35:53] night
[35:54] make them wear where if they want to put
[35:56] that booze back in their mouth make them
[35:58] so sick they throw up and have to have
[36:00] to go to the hospital
[36:03] whatever you got to do
[36:05] you put that cigarette in your mouth i
[36:07] hope you choke on it
[36:12] that's how desperate we got to be if we
[36:13] want to get rid of those things
[36:15] that's how desperate we got to be
[36:17] and you know what god will do it if
[36:18] you'll ask him
[36:20] that thou shalt confess with thy mouth
[36:21] the lord jesus and believe in thy heart
[36:23] that god hath raised him from the dead
[36:25] thou shalt be saved because you know
[36:26] what if you if you believe that god
[36:28] raised him from the dead where is he now
[36:31] he's in you
[36:32] he's in you guys
[36:34] he's in us
[36:35] he'll just go back to heaven and stay up
[36:37] there no he came back over the day of
[36:38] pentecost
[36:41] for with the heart
[36:43] not the mind
[36:44] with the heart
[36:46] man believeth unto righteousness and
[36:47] with the mouth confession is made
[36:50] unto salvation i confess my sins
[36:53] i don't want to live this way anymore i
[36:56] want to act
[36:58] act different
[37:01] that's what we're going to talk about
[37:02] tonight we're going to talk about or
[37:03] this afternoon we'll call why you call
[37:05] it the book of acts
[37:08] that's how the apostles acted
[37:10] that's why it's called the book of acts
[37:11] it's how they acted it's the acts of the
[37:14] apostles acts
[37:16] romans 8 verse 3 says being justified
[37:18] freely by his grace you cannot justify
[37:21] yourself
[37:23] no way
[37:24] you can't chop off your past sins
[37:27] i was talking to somebody the other day
[37:28] they were talking about well
[37:30] you know if we're so powerful to be able
[37:31] to speak things into existence we'd be
[37:34] able to maybe speak people into
[37:35] existence i said nope
[37:38] that's reserved for god alone
[37:41] now we're part of that creator we're a
[37:42] mini creator but we cannot
[37:46] speak souls into existence god alone
[37:49] thank god
[37:50] that god alone can only speak souls into
[37:52] existence because he's going to be able
[37:54] to speak him out of existence when we
[37:56] get to the end of this thing but listen
[37:58] if you have the soul of god inside of
[37:59] you he can't speak itself out of
[38:01] existence
[38:03] so then we are connected with god but we
[38:05] are little creators but we can't create
[38:07] a person
[38:09] only god can do that
[38:11] we create yeah i see now the creation of
[38:15] our union between husband and wife i see
[38:17] that creation but it didn't bring us all
[38:19] inside of you
[38:21] it brought a shell so a soul can fit in
[38:23] it and that came from god
[38:25] amen
[38:26] and then it becomes perverted as you go
[38:28] along
[38:29] because we are what born in sin shaping
[38:32] iniquity
[38:33] spouse from my mother's womb
[38:36] come forth a liar
[38:38] but being justified freely by his grace
[38:41] through the redemption that is in christ
[38:43] jesus
[38:44] whom god has set forth to be a
[38:45] perpetuation through faith
[38:48] in his blood to declare his
[38:50] righteousness look for the remission of
[38:51] sins that are past
[38:54] not for the future sins that's why you
[38:56] have to die daily that's why you have to
[38:58] get up every morning and say and don't
[39:00] say look don't say god i know i'm going
[39:02] to sin i'm going to pray this morning
[39:03] and i'm done
[39:04] no
[39:06] you don't you don't know what you're
[39:07] going to do that day
[39:08] but now the end of the night when you
[39:10] get ready to go to bed
[39:12] god i got a book here that's full of
[39:13] these things that i didn't have this
[39:15] morning and i pray that you would put
[39:16] them in your sea of forgetfulness never
[39:18] to be remembered again
[39:20] and you know what he's just
[39:23] to do that
[39:25] but the righteousness for the remission
[39:26] of sins that are past
[39:29] through the forbearance of god to
[39:30] declare i say at this time his
[39:32] righteousness not ours that he might be
[39:35] just and the justifier of him which
[39:37] believeth
[39:39] believeth not believe
[39:41] everybody believes in jesus
[39:43] you believe in jesus
[39:45] drunk you believe in jesus yep
[39:48] saw him other day
[39:51] but believeth in jesus watch his works
[39:55] watch what he does that's why i say with
[39:56] this baptism all this this we're getting
[39:58] getting a lot of people baptized almost
[40:00] 20 now be baptized
[40:02] we got to watch the results
[40:05] through the years we've watched the
[40:07] results and they've left
[40:09] i was looking at
[40:11] brother joe's going to compile
[40:13] uh all of our baptisms into one like one
[40:15] long
[40:16] string with the music behind it and
[40:18] thank god that we've got people that can
[40:20] do that
[40:21] and that we can be the benefit of it but
[40:22] i look back in 2015 and 2016 the ones i
[40:26] was watching the other night
[40:28] and and a couple of those people that we
[40:29] baptized and not even around here
[40:31] anymore
[40:34] i don't like that
[40:36] there was something they came to and
[40:37] then they left it as brother bob was
[40:39] talking about today about romans you've
[40:41] come to the knowledge of the truth you
[40:42] come right up to the door
[40:45] and then you walk away
[40:48] jesus said it would be better that you'd
[40:49] never known it
[40:51] than to do what you did and then walk
[40:53] away from it
[40:56] where's the boasting then it is excluded
[40:58] by what law of works nope
[41:00] but by the law of faith therefore we
[41:03] conclude that paul what are you talking
[41:05] about okay let me give you the
[41:06] conclusion therefore we conclude that a
[41:08] man is justified by faith without the
[41:11] deeds of the law
[41:13] the do's and the don'ts
[41:15] all right
[41:16] so that's baby form justification
[41:18] doesn't put you in the body it will save
[41:20] you talk about this a little bit last
[41:22] night it will save you there's a
[41:23] difference in being saved and being born
[41:25] again
[41:26] but they're connected
[41:29] everybody with me they're connected
[41:31] because you can be saved die tomorrow
[41:33] and go to heaven but you got to go to
[41:35] the white throne judgment you got to
[41:37] stay dead a thousand years you got to
[41:38] come up and give what an account of what
[41:40] you're doing now look you won't have to
[41:41] give an account what you did before
[41:45] but remember that same spirit's still
[41:46] there motivating you to do the same
[41:49] things you did before
[41:50] but if you come to the white throne
[41:52] judgment
[41:53] god is just to say okay i chopped your
[41:55] past sins off there's nothing you could
[41:57] do about that because you come to this
[41:58] place and you've reached this spot you
[42:00] couldn't go any further therefore i will
[42:02] impart to you eternal life
[42:04] and you can live on the earth but not in
[42:06] the city now listen no one sitting in
[42:08] this building
[42:10] no one
[42:12] sitting in this building
[42:14] can claim that
[42:19] no one
[42:22] now maybe maybe marty or some of the
[42:23] little ones below the age of
[42:25] accountability maybe some of the brother
[42:26] ryan's girl but when you come to the age
[42:28] of accountability you can't plead that
[42:31] not sitting here in this church you
[42:32] can't
[42:34] because you know
[42:36] you know that you stopped you know that
[42:38] you hadn't went any further you know
[42:40] that you might have got saved but you
[42:42] lost it
[42:44] oh brother once saved always saved no
[42:46] one's born again always born again
[42:50] not once saved always saved
[42:52] in that aspect
[42:54] because you see that in a denominational
[42:55] world what that's the lie of the devil
[42:57] they they
[42:58] shake their hand they give the letter or
[43:00] they have this thing in the baptist
[43:01] church you know and then they live 40
[43:04] years and then they have a funeral well
[43:05] they go back to that same thing well oh
[43:07] john was baptized at nine years old he's
[43:10] got a letter in good standing in the
[43:11] church so he's got to be going to heaven
[43:13] no if john didn't give his life to jesus
[43:15] christ he's going to hell
[43:19] like brother brady says if he don't
[43:20] change he's going to hell
[43:27] we think we're brash he did that at a
[43:29] funeral one time
[43:32] did you talk about this mine he's so
[43:34] good said if he didn't repent on his
[43:36] deathbed said he's on his way to hell
[43:40] okey-dokey then
[43:45] i wouldn't try that over here
[43:48] some family member may shoot you
[43:52] but it's the truth
[43:55] we put a lot of people in heaven
[43:57] the world does
[43:59] just because they're good and they did
[44:01] this and they did that that's the do's
[44:03] and don'ts
[44:05] if they're born again they'll go to
[44:06] heaven
[44:07] if they're not born again they ain't
[44:10] they might be given eternal life but
[44:11] it's going to be way down the road and
[44:13] they're going to be up there shaking in
[44:15] their boots
[44:16] because they know they missed an
[44:18] opportunity but maybe god to give enough
[44:20] grace to say you walked so far
[44:24] and you couldn't go any further so i'm
[44:25] going to give you eternal life but no
[44:27] bride bride that's sitting here today
[44:29] you already have that
[44:31] you already have eternal life you
[44:32] already went through justification you
[44:33] already went through sanctification you
[44:34] had the unclean spirit
[44:37] drug out of you
[44:39] amen
[44:41] right here sanctification when the
[44:42] unclean spirit has gone out of a man he
[44:44] walketh through dry places seeking rest
[44:46] find us none they hate being out of a
[44:47] body
[44:49] what did those demons say at legion hey
[44:50] let's go somewhere
[44:53] jesus christ i think jesus kind of
[44:55] looked around he said well you're not
[44:56] going in me
[44:57] and you're not going back in that guy
[45:00] they said oh we there's some pigs over
[45:01] here on the on the hill we'll just go
[45:04] getting them pigs and you know what god
[45:06] jesus said
[45:07] go
[45:09] right go
[45:11] and they went and got in them pigs and
[45:12] pigs did the best thing they could do
[45:14] they went and committed suicide
[45:17] i'm so i'm not advocating suicide i'm
[45:19] you understand what i mean but if the
[45:21] devil gets on you like that they had
[45:22] enough sense to try to get the devil off
[45:24] of them
[45:25] those pigs did or swine then he said i
[45:28] will return into my house which i came
[45:30] out and when he has come he findeth it
[45:32] empty swept and garnished we come to
[45:34] church everything's good we've been
[45:36] baptized we've we believing on the lord
[45:38] we we're coming to church and see that's
[45:41] what i mean that that one first when you
[45:43] start and begin at the beginning
[45:47] will tell
[45:48] what you're going to end up
[45:51] because you've come to a new way of life
[45:52] you've come to a new thought
[45:54] you come to a new attitude but what's
[45:56] going to happen is if you don't get
[45:58] filled with the holy ghost you're gonna
[45:59] the unclean spirits are gonna just
[46:04] you're never gonna bring fruit
[46:06] you're just gonna be in a message church
[46:07] you're gonna be gone two weeks you're
[46:09] gonna be gone a month you're gonna show
[46:10] back up
[46:11] i i like what brother donnie said he's
[46:13] talking about you know brother branham
[46:15] he said that
[46:16] people will be at the end time when the
[46:18] bride's gone the people will still be
[46:20] thinking they're getting saved and full
[46:21] of the holy ghost
[46:22] he said finally they're coming to church
[46:27] finally they're getting in church that's
[46:28] what he was talking about he said if you
[46:30] don't go to church he said you miss it
[46:32] you're going to miss it over there he
[46:34] said you need to come to church and hear
[46:35] it now
[46:36] instead of having to hear that little
[46:37] still small voice say you missed
[46:40] it you will not if you're born again
[46:45] because that voice is going to be in
[46:46] heaven
[46:47] with you attached to it
[46:50] then he said i will return into my house
[46:52] and whence i came out and when he has
[46:54] come he finds his empty swept and
[46:56] garnished then goethe and take of them
[46:58] seven other spirits more wicked than
[47:00] himself and they entered in and dwelt
[47:02] there
[47:03] dwelled there
[47:05] dwelled there
[47:07] listen folks those demons are coming
[47:09] back
[47:11] trust me
[47:13] they're more diligent than we are most
[47:14] of the time they're going to come back
[47:18] because they're uncomfortable walking
[47:20] through dry places and can't find
[47:21] somebody to work through
[47:23] so they're going to come back with a
[47:24] vengeance and they're going to work
[47:26] inside of you if you let them back in
[47:30] and they're going to dwell there
[47:32] and the last state of that man is worse
[47:35] than the first
[47:36] even so shall it be unto this wicked
[47:39] generation how many believes we live in
[47:41] a wicked generation oh my lord it's
[47:42] getting worse and worse and worse
[47:45] things are happening now that you would
[47:46] have never even in 10 years ago wouldn't
[47:49] have imagined what's going on in this
[47:51] world right now amen so we're ready to
[47:53] get out of here
[47:54] let's don't put our stock on everything
[47:56] on the earth all right it's okay like i
[47:58] said last night it's good to have a job
[48:00] it's good to be well educated it's good
[48:01] to have nice things but don't build a
[48:04] kingdom on it
[48:06] you're building on sinking sand
[48:08] you build the kingdom from above
[48:10] if you put god first he'll give you all
[48:12] these other things
[48:13] amen
[48:14] second timothy 2 19 says nevertheless
[48:16] the foundation of god standeth sure
[48:18] having this seal the lord knoweth them
[48:21] that are his and let everyone that
[48:23] nameth the name of christ depart from
[48:26] iniquity depart from iniquity
[48:29] but in a great house there's not only
[48:30] vessels of gold and silver but wood
[48:33] and earth and some to honor and some to
[48:35] dishonor
[48:36] if a man therefore purge himself from
[48:38] these he shall be a vessel unto honor
[48:41] sanctified and meet for the master's use
[48:44] and prepared unto every good work now
[48:47] remember that's just sanctification
[48:50] and like i said before we're going to
[48:51] read it in a minute he'll give you a new
[48:53] spirit
[48:54] a new spirit to what get along with him
[48:58] get along with yourself
[49:00] questions and answers i'm going to skip
[49:01] through this real quick but everybody
[49:02] knows we know that judas was part of the
[49:04] ministry of jesus christ
[49:06] now watch judas was sanctif was
[49:08] justified by faith and believed on the
[49:10] lord jesus christ and was baptized
[49:12] sounded pretty good didn't it
[49:15] he got started right
[49:19] he got started right
[49:21] he didn't have a trinitarian doctrine to
[49:22] get rid of or uh father son of holy
[49:24] ghost baptism he was born he was
[49:26] baptized right into the body
[49:28] on earth
[49:30] he wasn't baptized in the body of christ
[49:32] he was baptized on the body on earth
[49:34] everybody with me the 12 disciples
[49:37] and believed on the lord jesus christ
[49:38] was baptized
[49:40] john 17 17 before he could send them out
[49:43] he said sanctify them father through thy
[49:44] truth thy word is truth
[49:46] and he was the word
[49:49] even before the atonement was made in
[49:50] other words as a preview father my shed
[49:52] blood i sanctify these he gave them
[49:54] power against unclean spirits
[49:57] and they went out and cast out devils
[49:58] look at that they're doing they're doing
[50:00] supposedly what everybody else is doing
[50:02] they're casting out devils and healing
[50:04] the sick
[50:05] they were rejoicing jumping shouting
[50:07] praising god
[50:08] even the devil's subject to us jesus
[50:11] said don't you rejoice because the devil
[50:12] subject to you but rejoice because your
[50:14] names are written in the book of heaven
[50:16] is that right and judas was one of them
[50:20] called out sanctified his name written
[50:22] in the lamb's book of life not the
[50:24] eternal section read matthew 10 and see
[50:27] if that's not right he called each one
[50:28] of them and judas and every one of them
[50:30] right down there he sent them out give
[50:32] them power against unclean spirit
[50:35] the prophet of god tells us in a hidden
[50:37] light
[50:38] it says how the thing was refreshed in
[50:40] the presence watch this notice another
[50:42] thing once in the presence of god you
[50:44] get quieted
[50:47] you're not talked about now he don't
[50:48] mean quiet like y'all are
[50:54] your spirit gets quieted
[50:56] you're not tossed about by everything
[50:58] some little something pops up you know
[51:00] how to take care of it
[51:02] some of something pops up you don't have
[51:03] to take care of you got a big old
[51:04] support group
[51:06] big support group and man that'll help
[51:08] you out you know where you're standing
[51:11] there something happens
[51:13] i want to ask you a question has
[51:14] something happened in your life
[51:17] that something got to happen not that
[51:19] you just walked into this and appeared
[51:20] in the message
[51:23] there's something has to happen
[51:25] you know that you're a real christian
[51:27] you know that you've been in contact
[51:29] with somebody that's capital s
[51:32] somebody that loves you you know that
[51:34] something's happened down here yes and
[51:37] it's refreshing and not only you but it
[51:40] refreshes others like we were just
[51:41] talking about being salty
[51:43] then you see he said you've seen people
[51:44] that are nice but you don't stand to be
[51:46] around them let's continue on he's
[51:48] you're a little creator now watch this
[51:49] is where we talk about sanctification he
[51:51] said he'd give you a new spirit now that
[51:53] spirit isn't god's spirit
[51:55] we've read this before but i think it
[51:57] we need to catch this
[51:59] you know what the bible says try the
[52:01] spirit
[52:03] have you ever tried yours
[52:08] have you ever tried your spirit to see
[52:10] if it'd be in the face
[52:12] because there's something we got that
[52:14] ain't
[52:15] hello somebody don't get quiet on me now
[52:20] have you tried your spirit try that
[52:22] spirit to see if it's of god to see if
[52:24] it's of the household of faith make sure
[52:26] that that's not an unholy spirit that's
[52:29] trying to act holy you know how to do
[52:32] that try it with the word the word says
[52:34] come to church where it says read your
[52:35] bible the word says study the word says
[52:36] do this and that and the other if you're
[52:38] not doing that get born again
[52:41] now that spirit isn't god's spirit
[52:43] that's your spirit
[52:44] god gives you a new spirit then he says
[52:46] i'll put my spirit in him but the thing
[52:48] god has to do is give you a new spirit
[52:51] make your nature now look he said a
[52:53] little more gentle
[52:55] and say gentle
[52:57] because you're still not born again when
[52:58] he gives you this new spirit everybody
[53:00] with me
[53:02] this is still in sanctification this is
[53:04] cleaned and set aside for service this
[53:06] is cleaning you up so that god because
[53:08] remember when god enters your soul there
[53:10] can't be one speck of sin absolutely
[53:13] there can't be one speck of you left
[53:16] over or you just divorced the devil you
[53:18] didn't kill him
[53:21] everybody with me
[53:22] and you can't be married to two husbands
[53:24] at the same time
[53:26] but the thing god has to do is give you
[53:28] a new spirit make your nature a little
[53:30] more gentle what's it doing it's heading
[53:32] you in the right direction
[53:34] it's putting you in contact with god
[53:38] not in contact with the world
[53:43] or he couldn't even live with you
[53:45] so he has to get you fixed up
[53:48] i like i like profit
[53:50] he's just as country as a cornbread
[53:53] he gets you fixed up
[53:56] that didn't come from a seminary i'm
[53:57] sure them guys in the seminars are just
[53:59] looking there with their eyes crossing
[54:00] this i don't know nothing no that guy
[54:03] knew it a lot more than they did
[54:05] so he's got to get you fixed up first
[54:07] before he can come in
[54:09] i'll give you a new spirit then you take
[54:11] him anywhere you go all kinds of places
[54:13] he's got to get you fixed up so you can
[54:15] entertain him right now how do you
[54:18] entertain the devil is by having the
[54:20] devil inside of you
[54:22] how do you entertain god it's by having
[54:24] the spirit of god inside of you amen
[54:26] but so when you're on the first altar
[54:28] that's when you're on the first altar
[54:30] but when you hide away
[54:32] you get his spirit now that's we're
[54:33] talking about the holy spirit down at
[54:34] the bottom of the pyramid that's when
[54:36] you receive the holy ghost that's when
[54:37] you become a son or daughter of god
[54:39] that's when you become heirs and joint
[54:41] heirs with christ that's when you become
[54:42] into the family of god
[54:44] everybody with me
[54:46] then the holy spirit none other than god
[54:48] himself
[54:49] comes and dwells in you and then there's
[54:52] something about you the neighbors love
[54:53] you the people likes you
[54:56] in travail 1956.
[55:00] he's talking about ezekiel and all that
[55:01] now a lot of people even you pentecostal
[55:03] people a lot of times got mistaken in
[55:04] that you get a new spirit
[55:06] that's not god's spirit that's you
[55:10] that isn't god
[55:12] you get a little happy because you got a
[55:13] new spirit and you jump up down run
[55:15] around over the floor
[55:16] maybe and shout a little bit and speak
[55:18] with tongs and run around a little bit
[55:20] he's speaking to pentecostals
[55:23] he's burning their hide they just don't
[55:25] know it he's taking he's he's a master
[55:26] surgeon
[55:28] he's cutting them with that surgeon's
[55:29] blade and they don't even know what
[55:30] they're doing because they're probably
[55:31] going yeah yeah we know that brother
[55:33] baby
[55:34] and run around a bit a little bit and
[55:36] think you got the holy ghost that's not
[55:38] it that's a new spirit
[55:40] god gave you
[55:42] that's you
[55:43] then after he gives you your spirit then
[55:45] he said i'll put my spirit then what's
[55:47] the matter with this missed meal cramps
[55:49] you know what he's talking about there's
[55:50] another southern expression
[55:53] how many of you be the big old bowl of
[55:54] collards
[55:57] you get the cramps
[56:00] do i need to draw you a picture
[56:04] have you ever eat something it made your
[56:05] stomach cramp
[56:07] and then you know what happens
[56:08] afterwards
[56:09] nobody with me that's what he's saying
[56:12] you getting your stomach mixed up and
[56:14] eating all this junk food you're getting
[56:16] the cramps
[56:18] the pentecostals are we're eating what
[56:20] the wrong food and getting cramps
[56:24] okay i'll draw it out next time that's
[56:26] the reason
[56:27] you can't get nowhere with god
[56:31] listen if you get the cramps
[56:35] you're not going on a long vacation
[56:38] you're not going on an hour drive in
[56:40] your car
[56:43] now
[56:44] notice i hope that's clear now
[56:47] that's why but that's what brother i'm
[56:48] talking about
[56:50] miss meal crabs mess me and it's mess
[56:53] miss meal cramps you get today they
[56:56] missed a few meals but what they eat was
[56:58] wrong
[56:59] that's the reason you can't get nowhere
[57:00] with god that's the reason we can't get
[57:02] nowhere with god
[57:04] it's eating the wrong food
[57:07] notice you put a new spirit god has to
[57:09] give you a new spirit or you couldn't
[57:10] even get along with him
[57:12] you can't get along with yourself that
[57:14] old devil spirit you had in you
[57:16] so he's got to put a new spirit in you
[57:18] so you can get along with his spirit
[57:20] amen
[57:21] i'll put a new spirit in them and i will
[57:23] put my spirit in them and he said after
[57:25] he's given you a new spirit that's you
[57:29] don't get it confused with god's spirit
[57:31] it's not
[57:32] it's your new spirit so you can get
[57:34] along with the holy spirit if he ever
[57:36] gives it to you
[57:38] well i thought was born with this
[57:39] eternal seed i didn't know we needed if
[57:41] he ever don't give me anything
[57:43] no
[57:45] listen
[57:46] if you were some eternal something why
[57:48] are we going through all this all these
[57:50] stages
[57:51] why are we going through justification
[57:53] why are we going through sanctification
[57:54] why are we even reading these quotes
[57:57] if you just always this thing just
[57:58] popped up out of you and it just started
[58:00] growing
[58:02] only in the mind of god
[58:04] were you a seed
[58:09] and what is the seed
[58:11] the word
[58:13] the word was planted in your heart by
[58:15] some preacher by some listening to a
[58:17] tape
[58:18] by some
[58:20] evangelist
[58:23] and if they preach that you just you
[58:25] know you're just always eternal and you
[58:27] got this great spirit and all this stuff
[58:29] i i just don't see that that's a missed
[58:30] meal cramp to me you're not going to get
[58:32] anywhere you're not going you're not
[58:33] going to go you're not here for the long
[58:35] haul
[58:36] we got to be here for the long haul
[58:38] amen it's your new spirit so you can get
[58:40] along with the holy spirit if he ever
[58:42] gives it to you amen because you and
[58:44] your condition
[58:45] never get along
[58:47] you can't get along with your wife you
[58:49] can't get along with your husband you
[58:51] can't get along with your neighbor how
[58:52] are you ever going to get along with god
[58:55] so how so he has to give you a new
[58:58] spirit
[58:59] for
[59:00] that's before
[59:02] you can get along with him
[59:05] so he puts a new spirit in you
[59:07] and then he puts his spirit in you
[59:10] gives you a new spirit a new outlook a
[59:12] new faith
[59:14] then he puts his holy spirit
[59:17] in you so let's just make sure that
[59:19] we're not at sanctification and nowhere
[59:21] else let's let's go on to perfection
[59:23] let's go on to the baptism of the holy
[59:25] ghost let's go on to make sure that that
[59:27] that thing doesn't just burn the
[59:29] unclean spirit out of your spirit realm
[59:31] it burns that unclean spirit out of your
[59:33] soul
[59:34] the thing that's attached to that that
[59:36] old adamic nature that oh brother brown
[59:38] calls it a cloudy it's just it's it's
[59:40] smutty it stuck to you because of what
[59:43] adam and eve did everybody with me on
[59:45] that y'all quiet this morning
[59:48] you're quiet this morning amen okay
[59:51] that's exactly the truth baptism of the
[59:53] holy spirit
[59:54] thomas that wasn't funny
[59:59] okay so it was
[1:00:01] all right so let's look at the holy
[1:00:02] ghost just for a minute i know we
[1:00:03] background some but we just we'll get
[1:00:05] we'll get a little bit further later on
[1:00:07] because we got to get the holy ghost
[1:00:08] before we have the virtues you can have
[1:00:10] part of them working in your life
[1:00:12] but you can't have the full virtue of
[1:00:15] god working through you without having
[1:00:16] something to come in quicken and pass
[1:00:19] out
[1:00:23] paul couldn't preach that without
[1:00:24] already having him brother brown had to
[1:00:26] come to a place 30 years to preach that
[1:00:29] message that you perfect man because i
[1:00:30] believe he came to a place
[1:00:34] you said prophet to god oh please
[1:00:37] he learned just like jesus learned by
[1:00:38] the things he suffered so did brother
[1:00:40] brown them he was he had his revelation
[1:00:42] was progressing all the time because he
[1:00:44] was a human mortal man
[1:00:46] he wasn't just somebody that god just
[1:00:47] dumped everything on him and said this
[1:00:49] is it william brown i'm uh just go out
[1:00:50] there and preach 30 or 40 years and
[1:00:52] don't change a bit
[1:00:54] now there's certain things that he
[1:00:55] didn't change but there are certain
[1:00:57] things that he did
[1:00:58] everybody that's another another sermon
[1:01:00] for another day does he preach the white
[1:01:02] horse rider was the holy ghost in the
[1:01:03] 50s and then when god revealed to him
[1:01:05] that the holy ghost that the white horse
[1:01:06] rider was the antichrist
[1:01:08] he grew in grace and knowledge all right
[1:01:13] everybody all right with that
[1:01:15] so when he grew in grace and knowledge
[1:01:17] he was coming up to a place to where god
[1:01:19] said okay preach that sermon right there
[1:01:21] remember he was sitting down i love that
[1:01:24] what he tells he's sitting down he's
[1:01:26] supposed to be hunting squirrels
[1:01:28] lays his gun over to the side he's
[1:01:30] sitter sitting down at the bottom of
[1:01:31] that big old tree he's got a little pad
[1:01:32] of paper and a pencil and he said this
[1:01:34] is what come to me
[1:01:36] and he built that statue of a perfect
[1:01:38] man that drawing and how that faith
[1:01:40] virtue knowledge and all the scriptures
[1:01:41] that tied into it and then remember he
[1:01:43] said he got up and he had a pentecostal
[1:01:44] revival going around around that tree
[1:01:46] why because god had put things together
[1:01:48] for him that he'd probably never seen
[1:01:49] remember he brother brown said himself
[1:01:51] he said i didn't preach on hell
[1:01:54] hello
[1:01:56] i didn't preach on hell not being
[1:01:58] eternal until god showed it to me
[1:02:01] progressive revelation so listen what
[1:02:03] are you saying brother there's there's
[1:02:05] some things we may not see
[1:02:07] but just keep persevering keep pushing
[1:02:09] through brother brown didn't say oh my
[1:02:11] lord i'm so wrong i'm just going to quit
[1:02:13] preaching
[1:02:15] no
[1:02:16] he said thank you god
[1:02:18] that you've revealed it to me and i can
[1:02:20] give it to your people
[1:02:23] first peter once is seeing you purified
[1:02:25] your souls and obeying the truth through
[1:02:27] the spirit unto unfeigned love
[1:02:30] of the brethren see that you love one
[1:02:31] another with a pure heart
[1:02:33] fervently that's with fire
[1:02:36] being born again
[1:02:38] not a corruptible seed
[1:02:40] because that's what you were born of the
[1:02:41] first time
[1:02:43] your first birth was wrong
[1:02:46] your first birth is what your problem
[1:02:48] was
[1:02:50] or you wouldn't need a rebirth
[1:02:52] you were born of corruptable seed
[1:02:54] between your mom and daddy that was
[1:02:55] allowed by god to get you here so that
[1:02:57] you can make a choice
[1:03:03] have you made yours yet
[1:03:05] you better decide real quick
[1:03:07] the deciding time's about over
[1:03:11] being born again not a corruptable seed
[1:03:12] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[1:03:16] how were you born again by the word of
[1:03:17] god
[1:03:19] which liveth and abideth forever for all
[1:03:21] flesh is grass and all the glory of man
[1:03:23] is the flower of grass the grass
[1:03:25] withereth and the flower therefore
[1:03:26] fadeth away but
[1:03:29] but the word of the lord endureth
[1:03:31] forever amen
[1:03:34] and this is the word which by the gospel
[1:03:36] is preached
[1:03:37] unto you what i've been trying for 40
[1:03:39] sermons to get us see that you must be
[1:03:41] born again because you know what that
[1:03:42] was the sermon of the son of man
[1:03:46] you must be born again
[1:03:48] the kingdom of heaven is at hand you
[1:03:50] must be born again
[1:03:53] and no one was born again while he was
[1:03:55] here
[1:03:56] so what did he do he got
[1:03:58] he got the revelation from the father
[1:04:01] and he gave it to the people
[1:04:03] and then on the day of pentecost
[1:04:05] they began to be born
[1:04:07] his children his real children ephesians
[1:04:10] 1 verse 10 says then in the dispensation
[1:04:12] of the fullness of times
[1:04:14] he might gather together in one that's
[1:04:16] why i said there's only one message
[1:04:17] we'll read it tonight or this afternoon
[1:04:20] the bible says one faith
[1:04:22] one lord amen and one baptism now the
[1:04:26] scripture's lying if there's two
[1:04:27] baptisms laying in the scripture
[1:04:30] one faith one lord one baptism all right
[1:04:32] we'll talk look at it this afternoon
[1:04:34] but he's going to gather together in one
[1:04:36] all things where not william branham
[1:04:40] not in a message but the message
[1:04:43] to me the message is christ
[1:04:46] and in that it entails a lot of things
[1:04:49] because he wants us to continue to grow
[1:04:51] he just don't want us to say i believe
[1:04:53] in the lord jesus christ because the
[1:04:54] bible says and thou shalt be saved
[1:04:57] no there's got to be somebody that lives
[1:05:00] what he's talking about there's got to
[1:05:01] be somebody that manifests romans 8 says
[1:05:05] we're waiting on the manifestation of
[1:05:07] the sons of god not a manifestation of
[1:05:09] william branham not a manifestation of
[1:05:11] the lord jesus but a manifestation of
[1:05:13] the lord jesus through the prophet of
[1:05:15] god into me and you and we reflect back
[1:05:18] to lord jesus christ
[1:05:20] that's what he's looking for he's
[1:05:21] looking for himself
[1:05:23] and it's been so muddled so mismilled
[1:05:26] down through the church ages and so
[1:05:27] mismilled in this message where they
[1:05:29] teach this and teach that and teach the
[1:05:31] other and
[1:05:32] people get mad at each other for this
[1:05:33] mad at each other for that
[1:05:36] grievousness
[1:05:38] but the bible says gather together all
[1:05:41] things one in christ all things
[1:05:45] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:05:47] on earth
[1:05:49] even in him
[1:05:50] and him also we have what obtained an
[1:05:53] inheritance
[1:05:56] all right what is our inheritance being
[1:05:57] predestinated
[1:05:59] according to the purpose of him he
[1:06:00] worketh all things after the council of
[1:06:02] his own will
[1:06:03] that we should be dwight to the praise
[1:06:05] of his glory who first trusted in christ
[1:06:08] and whom also you have trusted look
[1:06:10] after
[1:06:11] that you heard the word of truth you got
[1:06:13] to hear the word of truth first
[1:06:17] before you can come to a knowledge that
[1:06:18] that is truth and that's error
[1:06:21] when you come to the age of
[1:06:22] accountability what do you come to
[1:06:24] you come to a place that your body and
[1:06:27] your
[1:06:28] psychological part of you your brain and
[1:06:31] your spirit says that's right
[1:06:33] and that's wrong
[1:06:35] everybody with me on that
[1:06:37] and now every day we do the same thing
[1:06:39] is that right or is that wrong but
[1:06:41] you've got that spiritual rudder inside
[1:06:42] of you now that says no that's wrong go
[1:06:44] this way
[1:06:47] when we were in the world we never had
[1:06:48] that what'd we do oh that's nice i think
[1:06:50] i'll go that way
[1:06:54] but whom also you trusted after that you
[1:06:57] heard the word of truth
[1:06:59] the gospel of your salvation
[1:07:02] your salvation
[1:07:04] and him also look after that you believe
[1:07:06] so you had to what hear the word
[1:07:09] read your bible start coming to church
[1:07:11] get a new spirit
[1:07:13] everybody with me you get a new spirit
[1:07:15] that spirit says read the word of god
[1:07:19] throw the magazines away or don't
[1:07:21] magazine anymore quit watching this and
[1:07:22] quit doing this quit doing you're
[1:07:24] shaving that off at sanctification
[1:07:26] that's why i said
[1:07:27] don't don't base you got the new birth
[1:07:29] because you don't smoke anymore
[1:07:31] don't base your uh your
[1:07:34] your salve don't brace your new birth on
[1:07:36] that well i read that message and it
[1:07:38] really it really did me some good well
[1:07:40] we'll see
[1:07:43] if you got the new birth you're just
[1:07:44] reading the newspaper
[1:07:45] if you don't have the new birth you just
[1:07:46] read the newspaper
[1:07:48] but with the new birth you read the love
[1:07:49] letter
[1:07:51] amen
[1:07:52] god never intended for us to read the
[1:07:54] bible like a newspaper
[1:07:59] it's revealed
[1:08:01] to babe such and we'll learn
[1:08:03] we'll read that tonight
[1:08:05] after that you believed after that you
[1:08:07] heard the word of truth after that you
[1:08:09] believed you were sealed with that holy
[1:08:10] spirit of promise which is the earnest
[1:08:12] of our inheritance until the redemption
[1:08:14] of the purchased possession so there's
[1:08:16] there's a peace
[1:08:18] or a part
[1:08:20] amen
[1:08:22] the down payment then you got to make
[1:08:24] your payments right
[1:08:26] right
[1:08:28] until the redemption of what the
[1:08:30] purchased possession what did he possess
[1:08:32] at calvary not only your soul he
[1:08:35] possessed and and brought your body
[1:08:38] under subjection if you'll just let it
[1:08:40] he purchased every bit of that
[1:08:42] at calvary
[1:08:45] purchase your body
[1:08:46] your spirit and your soul
[1:08:50] we just know that the first inlet
[1:08:53] is god working in the soul because he's
[1:08:54] a spiritual being
[1:08:56] everybody with me
[1:08:57] on the day of pentecost he was a
[1:08:59] spiritual being son of god went into
[1:09:01] those groups of people
[1:09:03] burn out the old dynamic nature burn out
[1:09:05] the old nature they had and put his
[1:09:07] nature
[1:09:08] inside of them
[1:09:10] everybody with me and that's how the
[1:09:11] church got started
[1:09:13] that's how the bride got started well
[1:09:14] guess what we come over here in the end
[1:09:16] time and they try to change it oh just
[1:09:17] believe brother i was a prophet oh just
[1:09:19] believe this seed was in you you got to
[1:09:21] do just like they did
[1:09:23] you got to go through justification you
[1:09:24] got to go through sanctification and you
[1:09:26] said well i don't really know you better
[1:09:28] start praying
[1:09:30] because you're going to have to know
[1:09:31] that you know that you know
[1:09:35] quit messing around with god
[1:09:39] he's long suffering sister gail always
[1:09:41] said god's long his arm but
[1:09:43] arm is long but it's got an end
[1:09:47] his arm may go way out under but there's
[1:09:49] an end to it
[1:09:50] like about the bottom of a barrel you
[1:09:52] say well that barrel's deep it's deep
[1:09:53] but it's got a bottom to it
[1:09:55] amen so same thing with god he's long
[1:09:57] suffering but you know one day he was
[1:09:59] long suffering in the days of noah the
[1:10:00] bible says but there was a time when he
[1:10:02] shut the door
[1:10:04] i've had enough i'm done there's nobody
[1:10:06] else going to believe me
[1:10:08] they're sealed in lock the door and
[1:10:10] whatever happens outside you've made
[1:10:12] your choice
[1:10:14] that's what we're going to be doing now
[1:10:16] in the end time we're going to have to
[1:10:17] make our choice
[1:10:19] to stand with god
[1:10:21] or you're going to be took by the devil
[1:10:23] brother ramsay you get caught in that
[1:10:24] system
[1:10:25] and not even know it if you know if
[1:10:27] you're born again you won't
[1:10:31] you'll get confused
[1:10:32] probably god tells us
[1:10:34] but you won't ever go back in that
[1:10:35] system if you get born again that's the
[1:10:37] spirit of god
[1:10:39] that's not the spirit that's not just
[1:10:40] like that spirit that god gave you to
[1:10:41] get along with yourself
[1:10:43] john 14 verse 15 says if you love me
[1:10:50] if you love me
[1:10:54] keep my
[1:10:56] commandments one more time if you love
[1:10:59] me
[1:11:01] keep my commandments
[1:11:05] and that's not filial love
[1:11:07] that's agape love
[1:11:10] that's him talking back to himself
[1:11:13] that's what agape love is
[1:11:15] video love is like this
[1:11:18] if you don't like me i ain't gonna like
[1:11:20] you
[1:11:22] but what's agape love i'm gonna love you
[1:11:24] anyway
[1:11:25] regardless if you hate me i'm gonna love
[1:11:27] you anyway
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:30] we all know feel your love is
[1:11:32] conditional y'all know that come on
[1:11:37] amen
[1:11:39] i'm gonna make you say amen because it
[1:11:40] is sorry
[1:11:44] if you love me
[1:11:46] keep my commandments
[1:11:48] if you come to the new birth you've got
[1:11:50] to keep my commandments
[1:11:53] because that is the commandment
[1:11:56] and i will pray the father and he shall
[1:11:58] give you another comforter
[1:12:00] that may abide with you forever
[1:12:02] even the spirit of some truth
[1:12:06] oh them's big letters
[1:12:08] even the spirit of truth
[1:12:11] whom the world cannot
[1:12:13] receive
[1:12:16] because it seeth him not
[1:12:18] neither knoweth him
[1:12:20] but you shall know him for he shall
[1:12:21] dwell with you and in you
[1:12:24] not just with you
[1:12:26] in you
[1:12:28] and listen when something dwells inside
[1:12:30] of you it possesses you
[1:12:32] when you have a devil inside of you it
[1:12:34] possesses you right
[1:12:37] there's a possession
[1:12:38] well guess what there's a possession in
[1:12:40] god
[1:12:42] if he possesses you he's got you you're
[1:12:44] all wrapped up in him and you will do
[1:12:46] his commandments
[1:12:48] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[1:12:50] come to you i'll stop right here yet a
[1:12:52] little while in the world save me no
[1:12:54] more but you'll see me
[1:12:57] because i live you shall live also and
[1:12:59] at that day
[1:13:00] you shall know that i am in the father
[1:13:02] and ye and me
[1:13:04] and i and you
[1:13:07] let's read this one and then we'll close
[1:13:10] first corinthians three verse one said i
[1:13:11] brethren could not speak unto you as
[1:13:14] unto spiritual
[1:13:15] but carnal
[1:13:17] even as unto babes in christ
[1:13:20] i have fed you with milk and not with
[1:13:22] meat
[1:13:23] for hitherto you were not able to bury
[1:13:26] we don't like to choke little kids do we
[1:13:28] no
[1:13:30] because you were not able to bear it
[1:13:32] neither yet now are you able
[1:13:34] for ye are yet carnal for whereas there
[1:13:37] is among you envy and strife what
[1:13:39] demons
[1:13:41] devils in your spirit realm
[1:13:43] that is making you do these things
[1:13:46] carnal strife division are you not
[1:13:49] carnal and walk as men
[1:13:52] first peter 2 1 let's musicians come
[1:13:55] wherefore laying aside all malice
[1:13:57] all gown
[1:13:58] all hypocrisy lay aside envies and all
[1:14:01] evil speaking as newborn babes desire
[1:14:04] the sincere milk of the word what that
[1:14:07] you may grow thereby
[1:14:10] that you may grow up in god
[1:14:13] if so be that you have what tasted
[1:14:15] that the lord is gracious let's stand to
[1:14:17] our feet
[1:14:19] wherefore i give you to understand that
[1:14:21] no man speaketh by the spirit of god
[1:14:23] calleth jesus a curse and that no man
[1:14:26] can say that jesus is the lord but by
[1:14:29] the holy ghost
[1:14:30] because you will be confused
[1:14:35] simon peter servant apostle jesus christ
[1:14:37] to them that what have obtained
[1:14:40] obtained
[1:14:43] now when you go to a store you go to a
[1:14:45] store to buy groceries

[1:15:16] unto you through the knowledge look
[1:15:17] multiplied everything is ongoing god's
[1:15:20] just not flatlining
[1:15:22] he wants everything to be moving motion
[1:15:25] and of jesus our lord according us what
