[8:28] something all right
[8:30] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[8:32] day in your grace unto us Lord and we
[8:35] look at and we see a lot missing we know
[8:37] that some are here doing this and doing
[8:39] that sicknesses and things but we just
[8:42] pray that you would bless each one of us
[8:44] with your presence and maybe they can
[8:46] look in on the services or later can
[8:49] view the the things Lord and they can
[8:51] see that you know that we're here and
[8:54] trying to manifest whatever we can for
[8:57] the hour that we're walking upon the
[8:58] Earth we love you we thank you we pray
[9:01] that you would just give us Lord your
[9:06] understanding because that's our desire
[9:08] more than anything not just a head
[9:10] knowledge but a revelation to be able to
[9:13] speak upon Thy word we love you and we
[9:15] thank you bless those that are sick
[9:17] among us and the different ones that are
[9:19] not here because of that we pray that
[9:21] you'd bless and guide we love you and we
[9:23] thank you in Jesus name
[9:28] amen
[9:30] let's go to Hebrews 111 and2 then we'll
[9:33] go to verse 7 all right now Faith is a
[9:37] substance of things H for the evidence
[9:38] of Things Not Seen for by it the elders
[9:42] obtained a good report all right now we
[9:45] get over to verse 7 it says by faith
[9:49] Noah being warned of God of things not
[9:52] seen as yet moved with fear prepared an
[9:56] ark to the saving of his house by the
[9:59] which he condemned the world and became
[10:02] heir of the righteousness which is by
[10:05] faith you may be SE to the Lord that is
[10:08] blessing to the reading of the
[10:14] word and we're trying to take the things
[10:18] that we're talking about the Warriors of
[10:21] faith and talking about them in
[10:26] relationship to us all you know coming
[10:31] to where we're at to see ourselves it's
[10:34] not to just learn the knowledge of them
[10:37] and what they done they live their lives
[10:40] out as an example for you and
[10:44] I all right see they spoke of us it's
[10:47] not us speaking of them we talk about
[10:50] them but they really were speaking of us
[10:54] to come down and that's what we've been
[10:56] trying to to cover with the one you know
[11:00] that where we can see it like Abel
[11:02] offered unto God a more excellent
[11:04] sacrifice
[11:06] and see he had a
[11:08] revelation that he was born in his
[11:10] mama's blood from his daddy's blood and
[11:12] and he knew it wasn't fruit so he could
[11:15] offer that you know by Revelation all
[11:19] right then we moved up to uh dealing
[11:23] with
[11:25] uh
[11:26] Enoch and how that he was trans
[11:30] ated because God took him and because he
[11:33] pleased God he walked with God the
[11:36] prophet said with raptured faith all
[11:40] right he pleased God and remember I I
[11:42] asked the question how can you walk with
[11:45] God is it our
[11:47] lives that uh we live is that what
[11:52] pleases God or is it the Revelation that
[11:55] we're able to receive of what he had has
[11:59] done for us then our lives are supposed
[12:01] to be an outward manifestation of
[12:06] what we have accepted or believed or
[12:09] what God has done for us all right Cain
[12:12] was speaking of the pointy of works and
[12:16] trying to make his religious uh
[12:19] appeasement to God by his daily works
[12:22] and we know those things won't work see
[12:25] it must be by faith all right but then
[12:28] when I preach I know people they hear me
[12:30] and they well he don't believe in living
[12:32] good no I believe in being born
[12:36] again then letting Christ Paul said the
[12:39] life that I now
[12:41] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[12:44] the Son of God all right and that then
[12:47] uh The Works is supposed to be our faith
[12:50] expressed all right and somebody that's
[12:53] not living right but got a great
[12:56] Revelation you
[12:57] know right would just tell that person
[13:01] said you're just proving you're
[13:04] lost because if you're if your uh works
[13:08] is not comparative to your faith if the
[13:12] inward man is not coming out and living
[13:15] out then there's no inward
[13:17] man I mean that shouldn't have to be
[13:20] explained but see people say oh you
[13:22] don't believe in living good no I
[13:24] believe in being born
[13:26] again and then the life we live proves
[13:29] what side we're on you know right all
[13:34] right see then in doing that then we we
[13:36] got into Enoch being
[13:40] translated all right that he walked with
[13:46] God and he preached the gospel to the
[13:51] people remember we went through that he
[13:53] was a preacher and he preached the
[13:56] gospel to them speaking of the coming
[14:00] Messiah that Abel saw by Blood by
[14:06] Revelation that they would have to be
[14:08] and that's why brother around said Abel
[14:11] saw the seed of the
[14:13] woman he saw that he his speaking was of
[14:17] the coming Messiah all right Enoch could
[14:20] not speak of just something else
[14:23] then so as he built an ark see I mean as
[14:28] he walked off the Earth in his
[14:31] Revelation he was showing what it will
[14:34] do for you and
[14:35] I all right and we talked about the walk
[14:39] with God how do we walk with
[14:41] God we walk daily by the revealed
[14:46] word all right that way then we walk by
[14:52] faith Noah Enoch Abel all of them was
[14:59] speaking of our
[15:02] day see that we would be here in the end
[15:06] time and could look back at those
[15:09] things have you ever noticed brother
[15:11] Brandon will say I walked with
[15:16] Noah he said I walked with
[15:19] Abraham he said I walked with him and I
[15:22] was there with him he said I was there
[15:25] on the day of Pentecost when the Holy
[15:27] Ghost came
[15:29] well you know he wasn't back
[15:35] there but yet the faith that's within
[15:38] him the
[15:40] Revelation that was within brother
[15:42] brandom was what was back
[15:44] there see that's why he can speak of it
[15:47] brother Joe would show it me because you
[15:49] look it up and brother bradam would say
[15:52] that when Noah saw that Enoch was gone
[15:56] said he started building an ark
[15:59] well see that looks like that
[16:02] he's well he went
[16:04] up now start better start building AR
[16:07] there's hundreds of years between the
[16:10] two and see that way people try to make
[16:13] those things contradictory forms or
[16:15] something but I was telling brother Joe
[16:19] and I've tried to explain it to
[16:21] you do you believe let me just say it
[16:23] this way and we'll get this out of the
[16:25] way then I'll move on do you believe the
[16:27] day the time and the people in the days
[16:30] of Enoch believe that he walked off the
[16:35] Earth do you believe
[16:39] that no he just come up
[16:43] missing do you think that they believed
[16:45] even though he spoke of it even though
[16:48] maybe he said said I believe I'm just
[16:51] going to walk off the earth do you think
[16:53] anybody believed
[16:56] him no but the record was was made
[16:59] because that's the way they kept things
[17:02] right but see then Noah one day he
[17:05] says by Revelation seems something
[17:08] struck him and he
[17:12] said you know the story's been told
[17:15] it Enoch come up
[17:18] missing and you know they never have
[17:20] found his burial
[17:24] place you know
[17:27] what they say he
[17:30] spoke of walking off the Earth one
[17:36] day and said you know what I believe he
[17:40] did see that way Noah saw Enoch
[17:47] leaving do you understand not physically
[17:51] standing there looking at him
[17:55] disappearing that's why brother random
[17:56] will say and see uh Enoch was only 365
[18:00] years old but brother Brown will say he
[18:02] walked with God for 500
[18:09] years and we'll say well no he can't
[18:12] keep his story straight well he might as
[18:14] I said Wednesday night he might have had
[18:15] a better story than you think
[18:18] because he might have been talking that
[18:22] Enoch
[18:24] walked about aund and something years in
[18:26] God before he ever even started the
[18:31] world where was that at brother Dale it
[18:33] was in God's
[18:37] mind we might have been speaking from
[18:39] God's mind
[18:41] that Enoch walked 500 years see we want
[18:45] to get those things in our mind and fail
[18:48] to see the
[18:52] revelation we want to try to find the
[18:54] contradictory things instead of
[18:57] believing God's word what if it's 300
[19:00] years or 500 years what if he'd say one
[19:03] day you know uh to Elijah that had 700
[19:08] people 700 and well no we know it says
[19:11] 7,000 you
[19:14] know well he couldn't be a prophet ca he
[19:16] couldn't even keep that
[19:22] straight but you see we want to try to
[19:25] make those things as an excuse
[19:28] that we don't have to believe the other
[19:30] things that he
[19:32] said
[19:36] right see then he'd say if you find me
[19:39] wrong on one
[19:41] thing he said then you know that I'm
[19:44] wrong wrong
[19:46] always don't to that
[19:48] degree
[19:51] right see you can find him wrong
[19:53] anywhere you want
[19:56] to as far as what we think
[20:01] humanly but yet see to that is not so
[20:04] then like I said we're going to talk
[20:07] about Noah and Noah he it hits
[20:12] him you know Enoch wouldn't as crazy as
[20:15] we thought he
[20:17] was we thought he' just come up missing
[20:21] or maybe went to another country or
[20:23] sailed off somewhere else but said you
[20:26] know what he walked off the
[20:29] Earth cuz that was his
[20:34] message his message was that he was
[20:37] going to walk off the earth right what
[20:40] was his
[20:42] message his message was that Abel was
[20:44] right about speaking of the coming
[20:49] Messiah and that he would just walk off
[20:51] the earth because of
[20:54] that you see it's very simple when we
[20:57] get out of our own
[20:58] s and let God do the
[21:02] thinking it's like I was telling them
[21:04] yesterday about see educated people is
[21:07] the hardest thing in the world to deal
[21:08] with educated people and the worst
[21:11] educated person is a guy that's got a
[21:13] third grade education physically but yet
[21:16] he's got a college
[21:18] mind that's the hardest person to deal
[21:20] with there is
[21:23] anywhere do you say to me say brother
[21:26] Dale this message M brought to
[21:32] me one God that's all I believed in one
[21:35] God and I the Baptist
[21:39] Church how many of you believed in one
[21:41] God before you ever come in the message
[21:43] of the
[21:44] hour you
[21:48] thought you thought got a couple of
[21:50] hands when I said you
[21:53] thought but you see I can say the
[21:57] Baptist Doctrine is one
[22:00] God and say well what do you mean
[22:03] brother Brandon brought the Revelation
[22:04] one God we believed in one
[22:07] God see that's an educated
[22:09] idiot because that's where brother mol
[22:11] nailed me to the wall with it he said
[22:13] explain
[22:15] it I said the best I can do is God in
[22:18] three persons he said you're just as
[22:20] Trinity as anybody else if you got three
[22:22] person other personality is individual
[22:24] individual
[22:26] person
[22:29] bless God I saw one God for I ever heard
[22:31] of brother
[22:33] brandham I believe there something
[22:35] happened in the garden it was different
[22:37] than eating an apple before I ever heard
[22:39] of the
[22:42] Prophet learn
[22:44] Larin way before brother brandham
[22:46] thought it t horse rider was the
[22:49] Antichrist when brother brandham said
[22:52] was saying in his early Ministry that it
[22:54] was Jesus
[22:56] Christ
[23:00] you see what I'm talking about I'm
[23:01] trying to get you to think about
[23:04] things Noah got a revelation that Enoch
[23:07] was
[23:10] gone and God was dealing with him to
[23:12] build an
[23:19] ark and see to get
[23:22] prepared for him and his
[23:25] household all right well now let's pick
[23:28] up now remember what we're doing with
[23:30] taking these that have made a good
[23:33] report through faith and looking at the
[23:36] lives of the day that they were living
[23:38] and then coming down and bringing that
[23:41] down to where we're
[23:44] living all
[23:49] right will your sacrifice be as able
[23:52] sacrifice that spoke of the coming
[23:56] Messiah
[24:00] will your ability to walk in what you
[24:02] see today be like
[24:06] Enoch that walked off the
[24:10] Earth on the Revelation he
[24:12] had well I just don't believe he done
[24:15] that now that's just a little bit beyond
[24:18] well then that means you don't believe
[24:20] you can walk off the
[24:23] earth
[24:26] right now get my point we'll move
[24:30] on see Noah knew God was dealing with
[24:34] him to build an
[24:36] ark right gave him the dimensions we'll
[24:40] read gave him
[24:43] everything and he knew that that was of
[24:49] God but then in in the basis of all of
[24:52] that he could look back and see Enoch
[24:55] and Abel had spoke already ready of the
[24:59] things of
[25:03] God so we begin to preach the Judgment
[25:07] storm was
[25:10] coming now is that the way it ends up in
[25:12] the last
[25:14] days is it not true that we're supposed
[25:16] to have the faith of Abel to believe in
[25:19] the
[25:21] Messiah and then is it not true that the
[25:23] bride is supposed to walk off the earth
[25:26] in a rapture before the tribulation
[25:29] judgment
[25:32] strikes well we can look back there and
[25:34] see them and see our
[25:38] day and where we're
[25:40] living as an as an example and we can
[25:44] see
[25:45] it all
[25:48] right see knowing that it lays in
[25:51] order but then moving with it as we
[25:54] would move into
[25:55] Noah see we read where it says said what
[25:58] Noah being warned of God of things not
[26:02] seen as
[26:05] yet there was no rain there were no
[26:08] storms there were nothing like that in
[26:10] the days of Noah The Fountains of the
[26:13] deep push the water up and all of the
[26:15] different things Tak place and you say
[26:18] well I just can't see that you go out
[26:20] there and lay a piece of plywood down on
[26:23] the
[26:24] ground and in the morning look
[26:26] underneath it and you'll find where the
[26:28] water's
[26:29] at right you're out in the desert and
[26:33] you need some water you hang up a piece
[26:36] of
[26:38] plastic close to the ground and it'll
[26:40] draw enough moisture in there until you
[26:42] can drink the
[26:44] water they're still doing it now that's
[26:47] what you call your water
[26:49] table at that time they didn't have rain
[26:52] out of the sky it was the water
[26:54] table all right so he knew knew that he
[26:58] understood what was taking
[27:00] place and he started speaking of a
[27:03] coming
[27:06] flood of rain and his brother around
[27:09] said they could shoot the stars and
[27:11] prove to him they would no water up
[27:13] there but they didn't read the Bible
[27:15] because it said the waters in the
[27:17] heavens and the waters on the earth it
[27:19] was there they just couldn't see it
[27:22] their scientific instruments would not
[27:24] record what was out there because it was
[27:26] not in a liquid
[27:30] form right I mean is is it liquid out
[27:33] there right now no when the cloud forms
[27:36] and when it goes through the chains and
[27:38] the thing then you start water falling
[27:40] out of the
[27:41] cloud it's not it's just a water's dir
[27:44] floating around and all at once it
[27:46] starts dropping it's got to go through
[27:48] chemical changes all right but now are
[27:52] you
[27:55] listening he prepared an ark
[28:00] to the saving of his
[28:04] house all
[28:06] right will our revelation of
[28:12] God provide an ark for the saving of our
[28:20] home
[28:23] right will it provide something for a
[28:26] family and like around and said it if
[28:28] you don't have enough faith for your
[28:31] family to be saved he said then I doubt
[28:35] you having enough faith for
[28:38] yourself well because there's only one
[28:40] Faith one Lord one baptism it's not not
[28:43] many
[28:46] things but
[28:48] see God spoke to no one said it's going
[28:51] to
[28:53] rain there's going to be a judgment come
[28:55] upon the world 120 20 years he preached
[28:59] that to the
[29:01] people all right at the time he was
[29:04] building an ark when you know in that
[29:06] day it was more scientific in today and
[29:08] they would have probably told us hey
[29:11] look you think a Titanic is something
[29:14] we'll build you a ship if that's what
[29:16] you
[29:18] want he said but God didn't tell me to
[29:20] build it out of metal he didn't tell me
[29:23] to do it out of this that or the
[29:26] other
[29:27] they were already tempering steel and
[29:29] metal there in Genesis because you read
[29:31] about uh musical instruments and all
[29:34] kind of things and in Genesis and just a
[29:38] very few years after the the fall they
[29:41] were already doing
[29:43] things
[29:45] right and then you get over to to the
[29:50] uh you know won't go through it but get
[29:53] over there to building the the the
[29:55] pyramids and the things they were able
[29:57] to do those
[29:59] things and you know what they was
[30:01] building a tower to go all the way up
[30:03] into
[30:05] heaven now if you think they could stack
[30:07] block on block to get up in the
[30:10] atmosphere now you need to think that
[30:12] over a little bit you know you need to
[30:15] upgrade your
[30:16] thinking what kind of tower was they
[30:19] building a spaceship
[30:23] Tower
[30:25] right you can't build a tower that can
[30:28] be seen around the
[30:30] world you can't Stack Rock on top of
[30:32] rock if you did you'd throw the world
[30:34] out of
[30:36] Gater I mean how about I what is it 93
[30:39] million miles to the to the Moon isn't
[30:41] it or something like that a sun how many
[30:44] how far is it to the moon and how could
[30:47] you stack block on top of block that
[30:50] high do we need to get all that out of
[30:52] our mind mentally speaking and get down
[30:55] to the fact of what was taking place
[31:00] they had come to a One World Government
[31:01] because their language was one
[31:04] right and they had it going that they
[31:07] was going to build
[31:09] a
[31:11] rockets and I've told you before it
[31:13] wouldn't bother me what one word if they
[31:17] went back up to the moon and they
[31:19] stumbled on a spaceship that was there
[31:22] before the flood that wouldn't bother me
[31:25] none whatsoever I would say
[31:30] amen and to read before even heard of
[31:33] brother random of pyramids that had old
[31:35] waterwork systems in them and batteries
[31:38] and
[31:40] things back before the
[31:43] flood a scientific
[31:46] people
[31:48] right why they could tell Noah I said no
[31:50] it's not going to
[31:51] rain but you know what that didn't stop
[31:54] him and they can say no will supply I
[31:57] use the material we'll do all this he
[31:58] said no I'll take care of it
[32:01] myself men my boys is going to build an
[32:08] ark well in building that Ark he
[32:14] built a transportation
[32:17] piece for him and his family
[32:23] right which would speak of
[32:26] redemption
[32:27] right you remember it was in three
[32:29] layers you had the animals in this and
[32:32] animals in this and the top part was the
[32:34] human dwellings justification
[32:37] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[32:39] Ghost which all of the speaking he was
[32:41] speaking of redemption he was a preacher
[32:42] of
[32:45] righteousness Enoch built the pyramids
[32:47] right which was a Bible in
[32:51] stone
[32:55] true then see see they were speaking of
[32:58] the coming
[33:01] Messiah Noah was speaking of the fact
[33:04] that God was going to provide a way to
[33:07] save
[33:09] people
[33:12] right all right then why can't we
[33:15] see
[33:18] that our
[33:20] day like I said will
[33:23] your Revelation provide you an
[33:33] Mark or are you living in the Ark of
[33:37] Safety but two will it provide it for
[33:40] your
[33:44] family now how many of you would if you
[33:48] had three
[33:51] boys and Daddy come
[33:54] in he says boys we're going to build an
[33:56] AR
[34:01] okay
[34:02] pop which Bridge Building Company we're
[34:05] going to get to do
[34:07] it and number one where we going to get
[34:10] the
[34:12] money to build it
[34:14] with and number two who's going to do
[34:17] the
[34:20] work
[34:23] right he say we're going to do it
[34:25] boys
[34:28] so then they must have believed
[34:34] him my point is did the
[34:38] boat save Noah's
[34:43] family physically preserved them took
[34:46] them up rote them over come back
[34:48] down but my point was or
[34:53] is did they finally catch on to the
[34:56] revelation of the their daddy
[35:01] had
[35:03] right see they got a
[35:06] revelation and they work day in and day
[35:09] out for 120 years listening to Daddy
[35:13] talk about what was going to
[35:20] happen don't you think as I said Noah
[35:22] could say look
[35:24] boys Enoch's gone
[35:28] I believe he walked off the
[35:34] earth now let's get to working on this
[35:38] Ark and the nastiest jobs
[35:42] of doing and
[35:46] working I don't say that that they had
[35:49] to do every piece of their material I
[35:52] don't say that they couldn't go down and
[35:53] buy some of it from some of the lumber
[35:56] companies that were were around them
[35:57] they got it
[35:58] somewhere but remember it's 120 years so
[36:01] they they might have cleared out a good
[36:03] bit of
[36:05] territory and then he pitched all that
[36:07] tar and stuff and man
[36:11] stinking you know they pitched it within
[36:13] and without stinking 120° and they're
[36:17] out there pouring
[36:21] Tower are you getting my
[36:23] point was it building the ark that saved
[36:27] his
[36:29] family or was it his family getting the
[36:34] Revelation that Daddy was
[36:39] right see now you're basing it upon what
[36:41] a prophet would say
[36:44] then if you can't believe for your
[36:49] family
[36:51] then I doubt you have faith for yourself
[36:55] but brother Dale you don't understand
[36:56] and my
[36:58] family okay go home get your kids and
[37:02] build an
[37:07] ark are you with
[37:10] me get your kids and tell them you're
[37:12] going to build an
[37:13] ark yeah you going
[37:18] crazy but you say kids
[37:24] look what I've got
[37:27] I can compare it with
[37:30] Enoch and I believe he walked off the
[37:34] earth I can compare it to Abel in his
[37:39] Revelation I can look at the things
[37:42] that's taken
[37:45] place and I'm seeing
[37:50] God come on there was God manifested
[37:54] upon a hill as we'd call it on
[37:58] Ark and everything that was placed
[38:01] within there like I said the layers the
[38:02] stories the things the windows in the
[38:05] top they claim some of them say it was
[38:07] actually built over on its side when it
[38:09] turned up you know they say it was built
[38:12] like a block it built I don't care what
[38:14] it's built
[38:15] like the main point was he built it
[38:18] according to God's
[38:20] specification certain
[38:23] size back in the Baptist Church I heard
[38:25] one day said
[38:27] boy that Ark was big enough for
[38:29] everybody in the world to get in
[38:36] it well you know
[38:38] what I've read one day then back to our
[38:41] that they was probably millions of
[38:44] people before
[38:45] the
[38:47] flood you know when my little old human
[38:49] brain didn't work too
[38:53] good how big of a b a boat would would
[38:56] it take to get a million people
[39:05] in Noah didn't know about
[39:08] nobody but his wife his three boys and
[39:11] their
[39:14] wives he didn't build the
[39:16] ark 40,000 ft
[39:21] long and 20,000 ft wide he build it
[39:25] according to what God God
[39:27] said you know
[39:29] what which would only hold his
[39:37] family he had four
[39:41] bedrooms the way it generally works out
[39:43] one
[39:44] bath right that's gener the way it is in
[39:46] our hom you know I always said if I had
[39:49] the money to build a house I would build
[39:51] a house and every room would have a
[39:53] bathroom it wouldn't matter what it is
[39:55] the only one I'd leave it out of is the
[39:59] kitchen
[40:01] right but every house room in the house
[40:04] have a bathroom in and then two extra in
[40:06] the
[40:08] hallway cuz no way do you ever have
[40:10] enough bathrooms all right make you
[40:13] shake thinking a little bit
[40:15] okay he built a four-bedroom
[40:21] Arc he buil it for just enough
[40:25] animals
[40:27] because God knew how many animals could
[40:29] be able to held and house within certain
[40:32] areas and he' build an areas for the
[40:34] clean animals and then he build areas
[40:37] for the other
[40:39] animals but he knew he was only going to
[40:41] take two of each
[40:43] one
[40:46] right see God didn't play because we
[40:48] talk about
[40:52] predestination that God knew that nobody
[40:54] wouldn't go to believe Noah his
[40:59] message nobody didn't believe
[41:04] Enoch come on you don't think like that
[41:07] they didn't believe Enoch walked off the
[41:12] Earth they didn't believe Abel that it
[41:15] was
[41:17] blood you know what Cain's lineages is
[41:20] no listing that ever changed to a blood
[41:25] sacrifice
[41:28] they kept right on with their works and
[41:29] their doings and their fruit their
[41:31] beautiful things and trying to appease
[41:34] God or Abel wasn't trying to appease God
[41:38] he answered God for what God wanted as a
[41:46] sacrifice are you
[41:48] listening noise boat
[41:51] then was their Arc of safety you ever
[41:54] heard brother around say it like this he
[41:56] said the water that destroyed the
[41:59] world was the same water that saved
[42:04] Noah
[42:07] right because it picked up the boat
[42:09] moved
[42:12] it if you went over and found the boat
[42:15] you know people will probably be
[42:17] surprised how big it
[42:20] was it would have to be more for the
[42:23] animals than the
[42:25] food
[42:28] CU they were almost a year in the ark
[42:30] floating they had to feed the animals
[42:33] and the
[42:34] things
[42:39] know but just get what I'm talking
[42:43] about Noah could tie what he had back to
[42:49] Enoch and also back to Abel that's what
[42:51] I'm trying to get you to
[42:53] follow and like I said I can take what
[42:56] God has revealed to me of one true and
[42:58] living God I can go back through the
[43:01] scriptures I can go back through L I can
[43:04] go back through Pentecost Wesley Luther
[43:07] Baptist Methodist Presbyterian and I can
[43:10] take the truth of each one of
[43:14] those and it'll tie together with my
[43:17] Revelation
[43:20] today it'll go all the way back to the
[43:22] book of
[43:25] Acts
[43:29] then it'll go all the way back to the
[43:31] Old
[43:32] Testament of all of those
[43:34] prophets and things that were
[43:37] speaking of the coming
[43:41] Messiah will yours do
[43:48] that do you can't take these doctrines
[43:50] of the message of the hour then and take
[43:52] them back through
[43:55] there that Jesus wouldn't go to the
[43:57] River Jordan how are you going to put
[43:59] that back in there and wind up with it
[44:01] being born Emmanuel God With
[44:05] Us you see what I'm talking
[44:10] about well you think you're the only one
[44:13] got to Revelation I'm the only one that
[44:15] I know of that's got
[44:20] it oh you're exalted no if you don't
[44:23] believe it that way then you got the
[44:25] problem
[44:26] problem right did the prophet say that
[44:29] if we believe there ain't but one person
[44:31] going who's that supposed to be
[44:35] right well I know brother bram's going I
[44:39] know you you can't believe it that way
[44:42] you got to believe it's you got it cuz
[44:44] God reveals himself to
[44:48] individuals
[44:50] right see Noah then as he did he
[44:54] provided an ark not just for
[44:58] himself he didn't build an ark with one
[45:02] bedroom right he built an ark with four
[45:07] bedrooms because he had faith for his
[45:12] family like I said we look at our
[45:14] families and say well I don't
[45:17] know I don't know whether they're going
[45:19] to be there or
[45:20] not I just see him keep on doing bad
[45:24] things well PR praise God cuz you know
[45:28] what somebody looked at you and seeing
[45:31] you doing bad
[45:33] things and wondered whether or not there
[45:36] was enough Faith to save
[45:38] you but of course we don't like it that
[45:42] way we think we're the
[45:51] Kingpin but just think about
[45:54] it God told Noah to build an ark make it
[45:58] a certain size make everything to go
[46:00] it's going to rain and judgment is going
[46:03] to strike the
[46:05] Earth and in doing that only those who
[46:08] will
[46:11] accept the message of Noah was going to
[46:14] be
[46:16] saved if that ain't predestination I
[46:19] don't know what
[46:21] is cu see God knew nobody else would
[46:24] want it
[46:28] do we built the ark a certain
[46:32] size all
[46:34] right by Faith by Revelation by God
[46:39] speaking to
[46:43] him God speaking to
[46:45] him and telling him build it so long so
[46:49] wide so
[46:53] high you know he probably had a lot of
[46:55] trouble getting his Revelation over his
[46:57] kids but you know they got
[47:00] it cuz they probably said Daddy we can
[47:02] do it this way he said no now
[47:05] boys remember God told me how to build
[47:09] it you got a better way yeah we can go
[47:12] down here and we can get us some metal
[47:14] and we could do this that and the other
[47:16] but said God didn't tell me that way
[47:18] now so the boys had to give up their own
[47:24] idea what do you say
[47:28] I've claimed my
[47:31] family kids grandkids great grandkids
[47:35] live long enough great great
[47:38] grandkids I've claimed them why because
[47:42] God told me to build an
[47:48] ark well you ain't started on it yet cuz
[47:50] we don't even have a pedal
[47:53] booat you
[47:58] but there's one thing about it the kids
[48:00] are sitting
[48:02] here some of the grandkids are sitting
[48:07] here and a great grandchild is sitting
[48:10] back
[48:13] there
[48:16] well you think your family's going to be
[48:18] saved because of you I have never taught
[48:22] that and never had any concept of that
[48:26] but I do have the concept of one thing
[48:29] God told
[48:31] me to build an
[48:34] ark for the saving of my
[48:37] household cuz he told me one day he said
[48:40] you'll be with there I was reading it in
[48:42] the Bible and said you'll be there with
[48:44] your
[48:45] Offspring well you know what I believe
[48:49] that why can't you believe it for your
[48:52] household yeah but your household never
[48:54] been like mine
[48:58] oh probably worse
[49:02] but are you listening to what I'm
[49:04] talking
[49:06] about taking back there but bringing it
[49:09] down to
[49:12] here see we talk about that Enoch walked
[49:16] with God we make that some kind of a uh
[49:21] uh special something that he
[49:24] was
[49:26] or a special way did he walk like I was
[49:28] talking you know did he did he limp did
[49:30] he
[49:32] do no he walked by
[49:37] faith my kids are not coming because
[49:40] they're my Offspring physically DNA
[49:43] makeup it's because I've claimed
[49:47] them well it don't look like they doing
[49:50] it
[49:50] well all
[49:53] right they ain't dead yet
[49:59] amen but the main thing is
[50:03] what Noah built a
[50:07] Ark you know really Noah was the
[50:11] ark you know you
[50:13] know I mean he was what the boys could
[50:17] look
[50:21] at and see in doing that then he saved
[50:26] his whole
[50:33] household you know what they wanted what
[50:35] he had it's what I've always said to you
[50:38] does your family want what you
[50:41] got and I've told you
[50:44] bluntly especially some of your older
[50:46] ones you need to go to apologize to your
[50:48] families the way you live before
[50:54] them
[50:58] I've always stood for this message and
[51:01] how did you
[51:03] stand with such a strong constitution of
[51:07] attitude till nobody could live
[51:08] according to your your ways and thinking
[51:11] and neither do
[51:14] you
[51:21] right come
[51:23] on no's revelation build an ark to
[51:26] saving his
[51:29] family what are you living before your
[51:33] kids you remember how I've always
[51:35] expressed
[51:37] it the reason those shearers ate up
[51:41] those 42
[51:42] children was because it wasn't Mom and
[51:45] Daddy standing on the side of the road
[51:47] making fun of Elijah and say or Elisha
[51:51] saying go up old ballhead it was the
[51:54] kids
[51:56] well if they'd have been kids of any
[51:58] reputable form or beings they wouldn't
[52:01] have been doing that but you know what
[52:04] they were sitting at the table eating
[52:06] and Mama and Daddy was saying why don't
[52:08] know Elisha go up oh bald
[52:13] head and them kids just went out
[52:16] there and told them be careful what you
[52:19] say to your kids cuz remember they going
[52:21] to tell it like it
[52:23] is you going to try to
[52:27] explain
[52:29] right you going to say now
[52:32] Benny now V I didn't really mean what
[52:35] the kid told you that that I thought
[52:38] about
[52:41] you no the kids going to tell him what I
[52:44] thought about
[52:45] him
[52:50] right see it's our problem about our
[52:53] kids the reason and our kids don't want
[52:56] the
[52:58] message and we've made it a book of
[53:02] rules and I believe in living right you
[53:05] know
[53:06] that but we've made it a book of
[53:10] rules until the poor kids they're doomed
[53:14] and on their way to hell for they even
[53:15] breathe a breath of
[53:20] life
[53:24] right but yet we believe the
[53:28] message
[53:33] right we're facing coming up to
[53:35] Christmas and you know how I am about
[53:37] Christmas you want to put up a tree put
[53:40] it up you don't want to don't do it
[53:42] that's your business that's your
[53:45] home but I always tell you don't make
[53:47] fun of the other person that
[53:49] does because your Prophet put up a
[53:51] Christmas
[53:53] tree but see the that but but but I've
[53:56] heard preacher but but there's no way my
[53:59] Prophet didn't do that so they wind up
[54:01] putting brother brandom in another
[54:05] age you never heard that and explained
[54:08] that brother brandom was in another age
[54:10] we're in the bride age
[54:13] now and we're not to put up a Christmas
[54:16] tree well your messenger is not in the
[54:18] age with you so that
[54:20] means you ain't in the bride because you
[54:22] ain't got no
[54:24] messenger they just don't realize how
[54:27] carnal do you understand what I'm
[54:30] saying is the life that we're
[54:33] living the way that we do which is the
[54:35] worst mess garbage can of
[54:38] all but is it at least trying to bring
[54:41] Christ to our
[54:45] family and try to bring it in the
[54:47] correct
[54:50] way don't tell them kids don't try to
[54:53] make them afraid of Jesus
[54:57] Jesus don't like the way you do give
[54:59] them a
[55:02] weapon don't threaten them with a God
[55:05] that don't like
[55:10] them if you ain't got enough Bry on you
[55:13] to give them a spanking then you're not
[55:14] a good mom and daddy anyway well brother
[55:17] Dale we're in a day when we can't do
[55:23] that we just go ahead through kids
[55:25] lose let them live like the devil and
[55:29] you blame the
[55:31] government my kids out there own dope
[55:33] it's the government's fault they
[55:35] wouldn't let me Spike
[55:39] them
[55:42] uh
[55:44] okay the
[55:48] Noah told his
[55:50] kids about
[55:53] God the great God that had told him how
[55:56] to save
[56:04] them he built an ark for the saving of
[56:08] his
[56:11] household what about our
[56:16] Ark I said the other day that Enoch
[56:18] meant rest but really Noah means
[56:21] rest see Noah was a preacher of
[56:24] righteousness
[56:30] he said no was a preacher that's what
[56:32] said that he was a preacher of
[56:35] righteousness because there's never been
[56:37] a preacher now listen to what I'm
[56:41] saying there has never been a preacher
[56:43] called of God that was a law
[56:49] teacher W go do what you want
[56:53] to you show me that in the
[56:57] Bible when Noah was a preacher of
[57:03] righteousness even John Wesley
[57:09] understood that it was not all just in
[57:11] the bases of what we do and don't do
[57:14] read his
[57:16] writings even he had the Revelation the
[57:19] understanding of God being the
[57:23] savior
[57:26] show me any preacher that would tell you
[57:29] I ain't nothing but I'm just a straight
[57:30] law teacher boy I'm just straight then
[57:32] he has no hopes he's an old testament
[57:36] preacher and even in the Old Testament
[57:38] he has no hopes cuz Noah was a preacher
[57:40] of
[57:45] righteous you realize everything they
[57:48] done back Dar spoke of the coming of
[57:50] Jesus
[57:53] Christ
[57:55] that's what I'm trying to get us to
[57:57] see and we're in the hour when it's all
[57:59] to be made
[58:02] manifest in a group of people that we
[58:04] talk about is going to walk off the
[58:09] earth
[58:12] well that's the the time is at hand 1956
[58:16] you want that he was a preacher of
[58:19] righteousness he condemned the
[58:23] world
[58:26] now but he saved his
[58:30] household was his condemning of the
[58:33] world and I know he did he preached
[58:36] against sodomites and things he did yeah
[58:39] but what was the main
[58:41] thing how did he walk with
[58:46] God because Genesis 6 and
[58:50] N the Bible says Noah walked with
[58:53] God
[58:58] that Noah walk with
[59:02] God I can see now that Enoch walked with
[59:05] God
[59:07] but Noah walked with
[59:14] God he kept building that Ark kept
[59:16] building that providing for his
[59:17] household preaching to the world trying
[59:19] to save
[59:22] them and you know what he was selling
[59:24] them
[59:26] now you you can get it in the right
[59:30] order they' say but Noah said look like
[59:33] your boat is not very big how's all the
[59:35] world going to get in it he said well
[59:38] then if all the world repents we won't
[59:40] have to have no
[59:44] flood
[59:47] right where do you need that at where
[59:49] can you find out well there was a man
[59:53] named who
[59:56] fell in the bar water
[59:58] and fish picked him up and and old Jonah
[1:00:02] goes over there and God's done told him
[1:00:04] he's getting ready to destroy that whole
[1:00:06] thing but you know what they repented
[1:00:09] and God didn't
[1:00:11] destroy now if you're preaching
[1:00:13] righteousness that's righteousness being
[1:00:16] preached see righteousness is when you
[1:00:18] tell people the truth because you
[1:00:20] remember how I told you go home and look
[1:00:21] up the definition of
[1:00:23] righteousness
[1:00:28] righteousness is not living a good life
[1:00:30] or doing righteousness is the fact of
[1:00:32] being
[1:00:34] right look it up it's the fact or state
[1:00:38] of being
[1:00:39] right Noah was right God Vindicated that
[1:00:43] Noah was right because he destroyed the
[1:00:46] world but had the world repented he
[1:00:47] wouldn't destroyed it like Wade was
[1:00:49] bringing out we'll get back to it on
[1:00:51] Abraham
[1:00:52] maybe Abraham was a man that was able to
[1:00:55] deal with
[1:00:56] God and God listened to
[1:00:59] him and he says if they 50 people down
[1:01:02] there you want to if it's 40 if it's 30
[1:01:04] if it's 20 if there's
[1:01:08] 10 God said you find 10 I won't destroy
[1:01:14] it you see there wouldn't have been a
[1:01:16] flood had the people
[1:01:20] repented but they wouldn't
[1:01:23] repent he had to be the preacher of
[1:01:26] righteousness because when Jesus went
[1:01:27] and preached to those spirits that were
[1:01:29] in prison and watch what he said in the
[1:01:31] days of
[1:01:33] Noah is that the scripture Jesus went
[1:01:36] and preached to the spirit in prison
[1:01:37] that in the days of Noah would not
[1:01:40] repent it stipulates that you know
[1:01:44] why because they had a preacher of
[1:01:51] righteousness but yet he was building an
[1:01:53] ark and talking of a
[1:01:57] God that was not as a personal
[1:02:00] experience as it would be with Moses
[1:02:03] when we get to that at the burning bush
[1:02:05] that he walks into the I am that I am
[1:02:07] are the Abraham that walks into the
[1:02:10] great
[1:02:12] MDC why does it say in the days of
[1:02:18] Noah when it says that they repented not
[1:02:21] see and it says in the days of Noah that
[1:02:23] Jesus had to preach to those spirits
[1:02:25] that was in prison that in the days of
[1:02:27] Noah repented
[1:02:29] not because the building of an ark was a
[1:02:35] type then you get the bosom of Abraham
[1:02:38] in your Revelation and it's not the
[1:02:41] belly of Abraham it was the faith of
[1:02:43] Abraham that would provide a place to
[1:02:45] die for and Jesus didn't have to go
[1:02:47] preach to those that was in the bosom of
[1:02:49] Abraham he did but remember he didn't
[1:02:52] preach to them he went and preached to
[1:02:54] the one that was in the days of Noah
[1:02:56] that were disobedient come on he came
[1:02:58] back up and Abraham is the first one
[1:03:01] that meets him at the
[1:03:02] door come
[1:03:06] on come on is that the way your Prophet
[1:03:08] said
[1:03:11] it Abraham meets him at the door and
[1:03:13] says Sarah this is the one i' when we
[1:03:15] fed the cave
[1:03:20] to you see the witness became more
[1:03:23] personal
[1:03:25] amen whereas in the days of Noah was
[1:03:28] just looking at an ark it was looking at
[1:03:29] the
[1:03:30] things and you start dealing with
[1:03:32] looking at a person we'll get to that
[1:03:34] more as we go along but just think about
[1:03:36] it see they had to be a Noah he said
[1:03:39] well Enoch typed the bride in the
[1:03:42] Rapture and Noah types the tribulation s
[1:03:45] that's good but he also typed the
[1:03:48] Jews would you like to read that one you
[1:03:51] can go ahead and pull it up I'll quote
[1:03:52] it to them but it's off with 397 no wait
[1:03:55] a minute I didn't even give him that 397
[1:03:58] revelation of Jesus
[1:04:01] Christ he represented the Jews they
[1:04:03] probably got it in Noah was the top of
[1:04:05] the Jews there you
[1:04:09] go he was the top of the Jews where
[1:04:11] would you bring the Jews into
[1:04:13] it see we only talk about Enoch as being
[1:04:16] the top of the Bride that's all we want
[1:04:17] to talk
[1:04:19] about but there's a lot more than just
[1:04:21] foolish virgins that go with it there's
[1:04:23] the Israel the the Jews that we'll get
[1:04:25] to the Lord willing some this afternoon
[1:04:28] if we
[1:04:31] can Noah type the
[1:04:34] Jews because they're not in the body of
[1:04:38] Christ now you're talking about a whole
[1:04:40] as a nation and things not meaning that
[1:04:42] there are not Jews born into the body of
[1:04:44] Christ because that's why we're in a
[1:04:45] gentile dispensation which means anybody
[1:04:47] can come in all
[1:04:50] right but are you listening to what I'm
[1:04:52] saying even even though Noah was not a
[1:04:55] typ of the
[1:04:58] Bride in the bases of what he's typing
[1:05:02] but he is the type of the Jews and the
[1:05:05] others that will be
[1:05:08] saved all right so then when he provided
[1:05:11] a house for his
[1:05:13] family Noah could speak of a house being
[1:05:16] made or a way being made for the Jews to
[1:05:19] come
[1:05:20] in for the foolish virgins to come in
[1:05:26] because he walk with
[1:05:32] God Genesis 6
[1:05:35] and9 you remember what we were talking
[1:05:38] about and been talking about how do you
[1:05:40] walk with
[1:05:44] God how do you walk with god well I'm
[1:05:48] just so good I've just been so good
[1:05:51] until God loves to walk with me
[1:05:57] I thought that our righteousness was as
[1:06:00] filthy rags I thought that's what the
[1:06:03] word
[1:06:04] said so does God walk with us because of
[1:06:07] the goodness of Our Lives or does he
[1:06:09] walk with us because of the Revelation
[1:06:12] that we're able to receive and believe
[1:06:15] when that others that are more righteous
[1:06:18] in their
[1:06:22] lives are turned down
[1:06:26] you remember Jesus the man I've fasted
[1:06:29] I've done everything I've done and I'm
[1:06:31] not like that guy over
[1:06:34] there the man over there said Lord just
[1:06:37] forgive me Jesus was asking which one of
[1:06:40] them went home
[1:06:42] Justified the one that was repentant not
[1:06:44] the guy with the good works now okay
[1:06:47] don't go wrong on me works is supposed
[1:06:50] to follow your faith so if you tell me
[1:06:52] you have a great faith but yet you're
[1:06:54] out in The Honky ton Living For The
[1:06:58] Devil then don't tell me you're a
[1:07:00] Christian soor am too
[1:07:05] old I remember years ago that there was
[1:07:07] a a
[1:07:09] strip lady that was a
[1:07:12] stripper and everybody went to see the
[1:07:14] stripper and then she'd go talk to them
[1:07:16] about the
[1:07:17] Lord oh that was a great Christian she
[1:07:20] was a Christian you a you going to say
[1:07:22] she wasn't a Christian
[1:07:26] yeah yeah you need anything else
[1:07:31] yeah but you don't know her heart I
[1:07:34] don't have to I see too
[1:07:39] much
[1:07:42] right oh but we'll go down to we'll go
[1:07:44] down to the beer joint and we'll go in
[1:07:46] and talk to them about the Lord be
[1:07:49] careful make sure the Lord sent
[1:07:52] you all right might be a rare occasion
[1:07:56] something might happen but this make
[1:07:59] sure he sent you but you're not going to
[1:08:01] go in there drinking and carousing with
[1:08:03] them and then try to win them to the
[1:08:06] Lord don't sorry forget
[1:08:11] it Noah walked with God it
[1:08:16] says and you know
[1:08:21] what is it the fact that
[1:08:25] he had a different kind of walk than
[1:08:27] Enoch had no Noah walked with God and
[1:08:30] the what it please
[1:08:33] God they got that one up six and N Noah
[1:08:37] Walk With
[1:08:42] God all
[1:08:46] right what kind of a walk is it a good
[1:08:49] life okay we're supposed to be that way
[1:08:52] that's expected
[1:08:57] but he told
[1:09:00] Abraham or Abram really walk before me
[1:09:04] and be thou
[1:09:05] perfect you can pull the rest of these
[1:09:07] scriptures up one at a time if you want
[1:09:09] to James 2 and
[1:09:12] 23 he's called a
[1:09:14] friend of
[1:09:17] God my point what we just look at Enoch
[1:09:21] pleased god with Rapture and faith and
[1:09:23] we try to make that some form of
[1:09:25] something as a different individual or
[1:09:27] part just remember these others have the
[1:09:30] parts
[1:09:31] too Noah walked with
[1:09:34] God Abraham walked with
[1:09:37] God job what one
[1:09:42] and8 Satan have you considered my
[1:09:46] servant job there's none like him in the
[1:09:49] earth a perfect and upright man one that
[1:09:52] fearth God in youth evil don't you think
[1:09:55] he walked With
[1:09:58] God all right what about David acts 13
[1:10:01] and 23 said David was a man after my own
[1:10:10] heart orer
[1:10:13] adultery
[1:10:17] murderer dirty stinking
[1:10:20] Rascal was God's heart that away no
[1:10:23] David had a repentant heart read your
[1:10:26] scripture I love that even Scofield
[1:10:28] knows it Scofield says that David on his
[1:10:31] way home from the bed of basba Cries Out
[1:10:35] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[1:10:43] amen what did he say tired of your no
[1:10:46] your stink is becoming your your
[1:10:48] offerings are become a stink in my
[1:10:50] nostrils but an honest and a contrite
[1:10:52] heart so David walked before
[1:10:55] God Israel walks before God according to
[1:10:58] Zechariah
[1:10:59] 2:8 and they're the apple of his
[1:11:03] eye of David it speaks in
[1:11:07] Psalms I think it's 12 and 8 I got BR
[1:11:09] down here and then race out part of it
[1:11:12] he was the apple of God's eye Malachi 2
[1:11:15] 4-6 speaks of
[1:11:19] Levi
[1:11:21] walking before God
[1:11:26] a covenant with him of life and
[1:11:31] peace he feared me he was afraid before
[1:11:35] my name the law of Truth was in his
[1:11:37] mouth and iniquity was not found in his
[1:11:40] lips he walked with me in peace and
[1:11:43] equity and did turn many away from
[1:11:47] iniquity these people walk with
[1:11:52] God
[1:11:55] do we walk with God in our
[1:11:59] Revelation what about the last
[1:12:03] one look at number 12 perfect
[1:12:08] faith my brother R saids I'm pleased to
[1:12:10] make my Abode in
[1:12:13] here this is my beloved Son and pleased
[1:12:15] to dwell talking about the Lord Jesus
[1:12:17] I'm pleased to make my boat in here
[1:12:19] there's no condemnation to him at all
[1:12:22] now when the same God comes to you and
[1:12:24] is pleased to dwell in you pleased to
[1:12:26] honor your
[1:12:29] word what your decision
[1:12:38] is you mean to say that brother brandom
[1:12:41] would believe that a human being could
[1:12:43] change God's
[1:12:47] mind do you believe in a God that will
[1:12:49] change his mind according to your ways
[1:12:51] and your desires
[1:12:54] not changing the bases that he don't
[1:12:56] know you're going to do it cuz he knows
[1:12:57] he's going to do that anyway but he's
[1:12:59] waiting on you to ask for
[1:13:01] it you remember who was it Hezekiah was
[1:13:04] that his name which one was it asked God
[1:13:07] for 15 years and he got
[1:13:13] it oh all we want to talk about is that
[1:13:16] he would have been better off had he
[1:13:18] died right there and that's true because
[1:13:20] he caused Israel to sin of great sins in
[1:13:22] them but still you know what God
[1:13:24] listened to
[1:13:27] it please to honor your word what your
[1:13:31] decision is what was Joshua's decision
[1:13:34] stand still son and it stood
[1:13:38] there is he pleased to honor your word
[1:13:40] your
[1:13:44] decision well then then what I'm going
[1:13:47] to do is I'm going to pray for God to
[1:13:48] change his mind no no that's not what
[1:13:50] we're talking
[1:13:52] about
[1:13:55] Noah was told to build an
[1:14:00] ark he could have went home and sat down
[1:14:03] and said God if you want an ark you
[1:14:06] build it yourself speak it into
[1:14:10] existence no he went out every day he
[1:14:14] got up and he worked himself to death
[1:14:16] for 120 years and all the time that
[1:14:20] anybody would come
[1:14:22] by
[1:14:26] he'd say have you heard about
[1:14:30] Jesus no no no no no no brother no it
[1:14:34] didn't come
[1:14:37] on he'd say have you heard about God and
[1:14:41] what God's going to
[1:14:43] do he's going to destroy this bunch of
[1:14:45] junk out
[1:14:47] here but he's told me that all that
[1:14:49] believe it will be
[1:14:52] saved he was a preacher of
[1:14:55] righteousness his message condemned the
[1:15:04] world what about our
[1:15:09] message do we have enough faith for our
[1:15:11] own
[1:15:12] kids you know for our
[1:15:15] kids why can't
[1:15:18] we yeah and I know what it is you I know
[1:15:21] what you say but brother Dale every time
[1:15:24] I pray for my kids it gets worse what
[1:15:27] are you going to do stop
[1:15:32] praying come
[1:15:34] on when it gets worse you keep on
[1:15:39] praying June can tell you I told her one
[1:15:43] day I said every time I look at Wade and
[1:15:45] see what he's doing I
[1:15:47] life not life because of being silly or
[1:15:50] what I said but what he's going to have
[1:15:54] to go
[1:15:58] through because as far as I'm concerned
[1:16:01] it's already
[1:16:03] settled well brother Dale what if Wade
[1:16:06] would have died before he come to the
[1:16:07] lord well then I know for certain it
[1:16:09] wasn't the Lord that told
[1:16:13] me what if Noah had got the ark
[1:16:16] ready and it didn't
[1:16:19] rain in another 120 years he's sitting
[1:16:22] there waiting
[1:16:23] I'll tell you some good ones we ought to
[1:16:25] get into the book of Noah and talk about
[1:16:28] him you know that Noah told them people
[1:16:30] tomorrow is going to
[1:16:35] rain and you know he got in the ark and
[1:16:38] it didn't rain for seven
[1:16:42] days eight days is that what you're
[1:16:45] saying seven days I
[1:16:48] know you know his kids even as brother
[1:16:51] Brown said come around and said Daddy
[1:16:53] are you
[1:16:54] sure you told us it going to rain that
[1:16:56] first day we come in here it ain't
[1:16:58] rained yet he said it will
[1:17:02] rain but you know what at that
[1:17:08] time now listen what I'm talking about
[1:17:10] at that time the day they walked in the
[1:17:13] ark it wasn't seven days later that the
[1:17:16] door was closed by the Lord the day they
[1:17:18] walked in the ark that day God closed
[1:17:21] the door there wasn't nobody body going
[1:17:24] out it was done settled it was done
[1:17:27] finished it was over with nobody was
[1:17:30] coming in and nobody was going
[1:17:32] out so even though the kids could doubt
[1:17:36] Daddy he said it's going to
[1:17:41] rain seven days he sat there it's going
[1:17:45] to
[1:17:46] rain but don't you think that it it
[1:17:48] ought to be raining by now oh it's hot
[1:17:51] in here man they're out there throwing
[1:17:54] Rotten Tomatoes at the side of this
[1:17:56] place making fun of it he said God told
[1:18:00] me it's going to
[1:18:03] rain then we got to wait 120 more years
[1:18:07] it's going to
[1:18:08] rain we got enough food in here to take
[1:18:10] care of
[1:18:11] us had enough food in there to take care
[1:18:14] of for a year or twoo and
[1:18:16] it you see what I'm talking about it
[1:18:19] looks like even God turned against Noah
[1:18:24] because Noah said God told me it's going
[1:18:26] to rain
[1:18:31] tomorrow sometimes God wants to try our
[1:18:34] faith to see if we really believe
[1:18:39] it
[1:18:42] right you claim your family and it
[1:18:44] starts getting worse and then you start
[1:18:45] doubting oh Lord and yours the worst one
[1:18:49] you turn your kids over to the Lord and
[1:18:51] they start getting sick and you said
[1:18:53] Lord I didn't mean it that
[1:18:55] way
[1:18:58] right come on is that right that's right
[1:19:01] I didn't mean for it to go that bad I
[1:19:04] quit praying for him cu the more I pray
[1:19:07] the worse it
[1:19:09] gets I had to overcome that I'll tell
[1:19:11] you a personal point one of the
[1:19:13] musicians is
[1:19:14] coming I'll tell you a personal point
[1:19:17] that used to
[1:19:19] happen I used to walk in the room where
[1:19:21] people were sick
[1:19:24] and try to pray for them and every time
[1:19:26] I'd walk into that room and try to pray
[1:19:27] for
[1:19:29] them they'd get
[1:19:35] worse they get
[1:19:38] worse I'm tell you a personal
[1:19:42] thing I finally come to the conclusion
[1:19:46] that I would stand outside the room and
[1:19:48] let other people go
[1:19:50] in I did
[1:19:53] because it seemed like I was causing the
[1:19:58] problem seemed like my presence in that
[1:20:00] room I'm telling you I went through a
[1:20:02] long period of time with
[1:20:07] this and it bothered me and I wouldn't
[1:20:11] go pray for people I say Brothers y'all
[1:20:13] go pray I'll stand out here and
[1:20:17] pray I didn't tell
[1:20:19] nobody thought he wouldn't understood it
[1:20:21] anyway
[1:20:24] and I cried unto God about it God what's
[1:20:27] wrong every time I enter that room they
[1:20:29] get sick the kids would be real
[1:20:31] violently be sick and I'd be in the
[1:20:34] other room I'd go in that room and
[1:20:36] they'd start vomiting they'd start all
[1:20:38] kind of
[1:20:41] time that's oh
[1:20:43] God am I a
[1:20:46] demon you
[1:20:49] know am I the one that's causing them to
[1:20:51] get worse
[1:20:55] and one
[1:20:58] day he reminded me of a
[1:21:03] scripture and you remember it looks kind
[1:21:05] of like in the Bible
[1:21:09] that who was it
[1:21:13] that Elijah that built the you know laid
[1:21:17] out the order put everything in
[1:21:20] order and then you said now the god that
[1:21:23] answers by fire let him
[1:21:26] come you know brother Woodby made a
[1:21:29] statement one day about it and it hit me
[1:21:32] and from there it opened up a
[1:21:36] door do you know that those people was
[1:21:38] challenging Elijah it wasn't Elijah
[1:21:40] challenging
[1:21:43] them I've read it in the Bible where he
[1:21:45] says you do this they challenged
[1:21:49] him he accepted the challenge
[1:21:56] come on they were the ones that was in
[1:21:58] the wrong they challenged
[1:22:04] Elijah and Elijah said I
[1:22:07] accept now you go build
[1:22:11] your place and I'll build
[1:22:14] mine so you don't have to worry about
[1:22:16] the challenging the devil's going to
[1:22:18] challenge you anytime you try to move
[1:22:22] he's going to challenge you it may not
[1:22:24] be I I challenge you no no
[1:22:29] no if it hadn't been for those people
[1:22:33] Elijah would have never had to said what
[1:22:34] he said so they were the one to trouble
[1:22:37] and that's what the Lord spoke to
[1:22:40] me he said just like it was with Elijah
[1:22:45] said they challenged
[1:22:49] Elijah he said when you enter that room
[1:22:54] those demons is challenging
[1:23:00] you and have faith step in and call for
[1:23:10] it I stepped into the
[1:23:13] room and I've never failed since
[1:23:16] then I made one failure just
[1:23:21] recently that I blame
[1:23:26] myself ran tried to give me that baby
[1:23:30] when it was
[1:23:35] born he said here brother Dale I'm kind
[1:23:38] of shy about babies and
[1:23:40] things I just always been that way
[1:23:42] they're they're precious and I don't
[1:23:44] want to break them you know you might
[1:23:45] drop them Ryan said here brother Dale
[1:23:48] you want to hold her I said no I won't
[1:23:50] do
[1:23:50] it and I walked out of of that
[1:23:54] room it went
[1:24:00] down I've cried and prayed ever since
[1:24:02] then it's back
[1:24:06] now well why would you even tell that
[1:24:09] because it's the
[1:24:11] truth I failed see and I took that baby
[1:24:15] I believe today had I took that baby in
[1:24:18] my arms and blessed it there would have
[1:24:21] been no demon would have been able to
[1:24:23] come on
[1:24:25] it when I walked out of that room and
[1:24:28] walked down the
[1:24:31] hallway I said Lord I've messed
[1:24:37] up have to wait an hour or two
[1:24:40] immediately I said I've messed up
[1:24:43] Lord and you take over and you bring
[1:24:46] that child out of this condition go at
[1:24:49] that time we didn't know there was any
[1:24:50] condition to be
[1:24:53] well he's done
[1:24:57] it see when the Lord speaks to you go do
[1:25:00] it immediately don't wait because you
[1:25:03] can get in
[1:25:04] trouble by not speaking and doing he
[1:25:08] tells you to go pray for somebody go
[1:25:10] pray for
[1:25:11] them
[1:25:15] right but you see folks God's waiting on
[1:25:18] you and I what's your answer what's your
[1:25:21] decision
[1:25:23] what are you asking well when you asked
[1:25:26] why don't you believe what you're asking
