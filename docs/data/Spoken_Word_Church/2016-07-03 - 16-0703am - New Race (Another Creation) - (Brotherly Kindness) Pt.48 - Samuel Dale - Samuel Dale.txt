turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Revelations 3 and then we'll go to Second Peter 1 it's good to see everybody we're good to see our visitors they're coming up and with us today and fellowshipping some of Brother Anderson sister Anna's crowd we had a good time last night in the Bible study we had more visitors that about it and we did have our own people you know to fellowship and had a good time in doing that together in the Bible study but we say to you welcome now some of you are not visitors because you've been here before and you know how we do that we say if you come one time you're visitor two times you're part of us so that just makes it to be the whole point right good to have everybody or some back like brother dick n from vacations others now there's a good many missing today uh that are gone to youth camps and things so remember each one of them you know the the families and the things that they all get a uh a safe trip back and everything will be all right remember that okay now the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday of this month it will be at brother page so remember that the third Saturday they start at 3:30 we'll leave here about at least by 12:30 to be able to be there so if you want to ride this it's a very short one this time but still the time we stop and eat it ties up and if you don't stop and eat you're going to have to eat before you get started so we generally always try to uh get everything set up we'll stop in Gainsville somewhere and get about to eat all right that's on the third Saturday so remember that and I uh pray that the Lord would bless each one and guide us all in his love all right uh we thank God for this tomorrow being the 4th of July being Independence Day we thank God for that that we too at this time still have our independence and thanking God for the freedom that we do have it may be fast being taken from us but we still have a lot more than most of the world have so we thank God for that you know and all it's been done to make it all all the lives it's been given to bring us to an independence day but see that's tomorrow because that would be our 4th of July and we started here July the 4th 1971 in the services here at the church so that means a lot to us about independence day but just remember Independence Day is the day you're born again that's the Independence that we want that's the dependence upon him to make you and I to be the children of God and that's that's the great part of it right so we thank God for him allowing us to have the time and to hear the word and and receive all of those things uh I guess that's all the announcements anything else remember the the things are downstairs for the uh announcement in October when we're going on on the train ride so we hope everybody will will sign up and be ready to go and and everything and we can go up and ride through the mountains and just have a good time together as fellowshipping as the body of Christ all right now uh okay I guess that's all and I got a whole bunch written down anyway so maybe I've announced enough anyway so the Lord willing brother Aaron will be ministering this coming Wednesday so remember that and keep all in your prayers father we thank you for this day Lord because we can this day enjoy our freedom in Jesus Christ we know tomorrow is our natural holiday for the land and things and people will be celebrating and all kind of things of our independence day but today is the day of salvation so we thank you for that and we love you and we just ask that you would bless each one remember the sick among us we know that there's many many sicknesses that are there Lord remember each one and these old flu bugs coming around and all the different things and we thank you Lord we ask you to just guide each and every one of us and Lord most of all forgive our sins cover Us by thy blood that we may walk in you because that is the only way we can think about anything in ourselves to be worth anything is what you've made us and we love you and we thank you have your way now and guide us and keep us we love you father and thank you for all things in Jesus name amen Ray and Kathy made it back from their 35th honeymoon how much 60 60th oh I didn't know y'all was that old anyhow it was good all right Revelations 3:14 and then second Peter okay and unto the angel Ang of the Church of the lady of sin right these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God and like I say then if he was the beginning brother Brown said we are the continuation of that creation all right so now we go over here in Peter to think about this new creation that we are in Christ Jesus and watch now where Peter is addressing this Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ who to them that have aain like Precious Faith so whatever Peter had these people have that this is not addressed to the world right the world cannot be partakers of God's divine nature the world needs to be born again you got to do that first and that's what he's saying these are to people that are born again this is not written to just anybody all right that have obtained like Precious Faith where with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord now watch him according as his divine power hath given unto all us all things that pertain unto life now he's GI it's there free Li unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue now we're called to this position right see whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and brother brand on the message of the position in Christ he said after we come into the body of Christ then he expects us to have his divine nature all right now watch him and beside this given all diligence add to your faith virtue into virtue knowledge into knowledge Temperance and temp Temperance patience and patience godliness and godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make ye that she shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now to not back up a whole lot but yet to um you know not carry on and go on through um to our visitors a good many are here today and like I said we had almost as many lies not of visitors in the Bible study and I hope they had a good time and and us just because that's the Bible study to us as you sitting around and just fellowshipping and asking questions and commenting and and that way and you know your sisters you have just as much right there to question and talk about as us Brothers it's just a fellowship time to be able to uh talk about these things and a lot of times uh it does relate over into the message that we're preaching and the things so then that's that's good and if you want to copy of that then it is available to where that you must request it from brother Joe or one other of them Brother Richard and him and they'll make uh you a copy of the Bible study that you can hear us as we discuss things you know and it gets kind of comical sometimes and and all and we just have a good time because I don't see why we can't do that to fellowship and to do and all but if you want that also too now last Sun last Wednesday's message you cannot pull it up at this time on the video it it was something happening they're working trying to make sure that it has happened one time before that we lose the video part we still have the audio it is there but we don't have the video part of it and they're trying to work upon uh a system to where we'll have two systems cuz that's really what we have back here see in the back we have a thing set up to copy ever service on the audio that's separate from the internet to where that we make sure that we have a copy of the services now I I've done that for years because I want you to do and if anybody on the internet system desires any of these things go on the internet you'll see that they're there from about 2002 on down to now and you can check out to see whether I've changed my Doctrine or whatever I've tried to teach to you for all of those years they're available whatever you want to do with them you can listen but I have them there for another purpose too you come up and say brother Dale you said so and so I said well let's go get the tape you know see you say well I heard you say it okay let's go play the tape if I said it I'd be glad to apologize you know but let's go play the tape well you know what I've never had to play the tape yet cuz I guess anybody figures if you're Stern enough to say let's play the tape that you know you pretty well know where you're standing so you know that don't make us right it just makes us safe I like to be sa about everything to keep everything in order and then that way you can check out to see if I've changed my Doctrine right you know and and see what you want to because it's they're available in all of the years because we just not that we're trying to uh Pastor anything but just open it up to where that if anybody wants to listen you're welcome to listen all right at least then you'll know what I believe now if you're honest and think about it if you ask some some of your pastors before you came here you ask them what they believe and you generally didn't get a good answer cuz a lot of them but just you know uh most preachers won't tell you what to believe right well that's one thing I do right or wrong good or bad I tell you what I believe and you say well brother Dale like one brother one time wanted to question me in a ministers meeting we were having and it was designed for that to try to jump me and I I I knew about it knew beforehand and Nana knew about it nanny did and Anna even knew about it and they both told me and said they're trying to trap you I said well I'll give you my word that I will not say nothing I said I'll give you my word right now that I know what their plans are they were planning on to attack me on a doctor old isue and I said I won't answer them so the brothers kept on kept on at the meeting that day to try to get me to to do and I said listen Brothers I just have to repeat the same thing I've already said you know you know what I've already taught and if you wanted to know what I already taught it's there and and there's no need of me going over it again CU I've always taught it this way well that pretty well put a stop to the to the point but you know I just like to be that way I think it ought to be I thank God for the fact that we live in the day and the time and the age and the situation I thank God that he sent a prophet to America because what if he'd sent him to some of these other foreign countries there would have been no ability to capture the message they would have been no ability to do anything you would have just had Word of Mouth things or whatever was written but look what we have we have the ability to pull up everything the prophet taught from like 47 you know up to the end and and all like that and thank God for that we can you know come to that point and that's why I do like I'm doing now see there is an argument among the people of the message to the visitors that we're doing there's an argument among the Believers of the message over this little Point called the stature of a perfect man second Peter some say well I got all of this when I was born again I have all of these things they I got them when I was born again the other group says we don't have them yet well why not just somewhere get in the middle yeah and be able to believe all the word of God there's quotes for this there's quotes for that but what about a reality in our hearts and lives we read it and Peter said add to your faith virtue knowledge well if you already had it then why was he writing for them to receive it all right that brings it into but we are not to the position as a body holder of the Church of Jesus Christ maybe to where the faith of the father others were I'll agree with that so then that puts these quotes some right and this right but bring it in the middle of the road and bring it to our lives and situation of where we're at all right see then we can establish then the things because as we went through this so far coming up through this we're over to brotherly kindness now and we spent quite a time with the message where brother Brandon would say like paragraph 142 143 of the Statue of a perfect man he says have faith and be born again he said you're only laying the foundation well you can look at the pyramid and you can see the things and you say how faith and be born again see like I said some believe that we get all of this when we're the day we're born again as newborn babies well why you want to grow in Grace and knowledge you know to come and in your prophets when it said it I didn't he said the holy go The Headstone had not come yet well you say well we've got everything just like the apostles well I'll go along with you if you'll divide the day of Pentecost cuz on the day of Pentecost you got 120 that had been tutored when they received the Holy Ghost it put them that's what we call the faith of the fathers and brother rown said they had these virtues but they didn't have the headstone okay you say well you mean they didn't have the headstone back there no that's what your Prophet said I didn't make those statements well I I think they had the headstone I think Paul had it well I didn't answer that brother Rams wouldn't said it see in opinions is is is something to talk about but it's not Truth All right but see he says how faith and be born again he said you're only laying the foundation then he goes on to paragraph 176 178 read the message statue of a perfect man he said these are the things that God expects for us to add as these things all right so now it's simple if we are to add them we didn't have them that's plain language I I like to make things blunt you know and you well who are you well love me who are you like we were talking about last night a question was asked about uh the uh standing at the Judgment seat of Christ well we had to express the message part of it cuz you see we'd say the Bible says we'll all stand at the Judgment seat of Christ all right now according to the Bible and according to the prophet the bride doesn't stand before the white Throne judgment right so there must be another judgment that's not interpreting something that's imp pling sense are you going to put everybody at the white throne MH see if you do then you're contrary to the Bible cuz you're not perfect see cuz you'd have to stand at the white throne for something to happen and your Prophet emphatically States over and over the bride does not stand at to White Throne judgment she sets on the Judgment according to the Bible with him judging others see that to me is sensible then that's right amen then when you say you know this to the visitors a point see when you say well I I've I got all these when I born again well what does it mean to add see you say I got it I got it just like the discipled like I said 120 received it because of the word they heard 3,000 received it and that put them at Faith amen because they were not tutored by the word now that's simple to me yes you know and and and that answers a lot of the questions of why we're here what this like we've talking about last night then it answers the question of what why we're here 50 years after the prophet's gone evidently according to the prophet there was only thing one thing holding off the coming of the Lord and he said it was the Readiness of the Bride that's right amen so evidently that's our problem that's right and that's the only thing that I'm trying to say now is we need these virtues that's right Peter spoke of it and we need them we have to have them it's not a choice of saying well we might to do this no but remember how we've taught it to you too that you can't say well okay and there's a Doctrine in the message that people say we're born again right up here where it says lady OA he that put us right to our brotherly kindness well that didn't I don't see how you can say we're bornn in a certain age that makes us that no see you got to get it in the right order to bringing it to a point all right now then bringing it down what we situation we've come down through is you add to your faith see faith is not an ad we'll get to the mathematical calculations later of the nine things that you see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 n you're looking at the pyramid that's right but there's only seven ads your Prophet said all right he said only seven Church ages all right see we'll get to those as we go along in the message but to just back up enough to people to understand what we're doing you see then you must add to your faith amen faith is not an ad that's a birth a baby is born a baby but it does does not have any virtues it is simply a baby it grows into the virtues of life in the natural so as a Christian is born again as a baby and you say well I've got this or I've got that you can have those things and not even be born again remember that's in Blasphemous names and stature of perfect man that you can have a portion of these things and not even born again at all all right but you see that it takes the new birth to bring it amen and then when it when you get that New Birth now you're in the place to grow right amen so you add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge but see what we think we just take add to your faith knowledge you remember how we've been covering that you say well I'll just I I don't need to worry about these other things I'll just add knowledge and then I'll add godliness and and I I might play around with a bloodly kind of no remember you don't go up a ladder two or three rungs you going to slip and fall you go up the ladder one rung at a time you go up the Christian ladder one layer or rung or what you want to call it at the time that's right the prophet said you try to add brotherly kindness he said and he said if these are not right here he said they'll all crumble that's right amen that's in statue of perfect man he said it'll all crumble why because it's not correct back behind but if you build everything according to each one in its place see that's right then God doesn't require us to have knowledge and that's not head knowledge that's Holy Ghost knowledge he doesn't require that until you have virtue what is virtue not a virgin life the prophet covers it it's the fact of Christ Living in us to make us what we have need of Being for the time then you add brotherly kind I mean you add knowledge to that and see then you come on to knowledge before you have required to have Temperance well bless God when I got born again I ain't had no Temperance since then yeah you just hang around me a little while and you'll find out I'll find a way to tell where that Temperance is right or not cuz that's what the Bible said about trying of your Faith worketh patience all right trying of your Revelation all right but get the point so you don't get this and in Jump way up here everybody understand a baby doesn't go from year one and you take it down it's the year old you take it down to the school and said now September when it starts we're going to put this baby oh we're going to bypass the the kindergarten cuz they don't need it we're going to put them in the first well let's don't put them in the first let's put about third grade boy that's really good it's Oney old you say you're silly no that's the way Christian Life that's the way people explain the Christian Life right when you're born again the Bible calls it an Earnest a baby to desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby all right so is it with the stature of a perfect man see to grow in it right and the prophet says it uh on the message let's see uh looking under Jesus he said all you got to do is just keep drinking in and said these things will be pushed out just keep inhaling the word as you take the word it'll push out the things we have need of right but everybody with me now you don't have to you don't try to jump the rung and go to another that's right God if you try to go to to Temperance without having knowledge then you think Temperance means don't drink alcohol the prophet says that's not what it means in this case he said it's that temper you have Blasphemous names he said it's that ungodly uncontrollable temper you have just remember how we went through what is the one member of the body that is never been able to be controlled the tongue right you remember what Jack Co that lady said said then my tongue is my problem and said I want to lay it on the altar he said ma'am he said this pull Pit's only 14 ft he said there ain't enough room well he was telling the truth wasn't he that's the thing is not been controlled by mankind all right because it's the problem with us is that all right now now so then we're expected then as we come up we're expected then as we grow these are supposed to be brought into existence and remember when we got to Godliness you remember that we got to Godliness and brother Brandon says what he said you come all this way you come all the way up to here before God expects you to be Godly then we went through be you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect well ain't none of us perfect and that's what I kept emphasizing the other day we say they ain't none of us perfect we're just forgiven you see that on the tags don't you and you say oh that's a great statement is that a great statement or is that stupidity come on if you're forgiven it means it's wiped out right it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness if you're forgiven well then if you're forgiven you're not guilty if you're not guilty you're perfect that's right the only way to be perfect is through the blood of Jesus Christ right but if we don't confess what he says amen then we went through it there the point of godliness the brother R said you come all this way he said now he expects you to be like God well I was like God down here at the bottom I remember when iten but there's more to the story remember what we were talking about to be like God do you know that the Bible says that people have a form of godliness and deny the power thereof that's second Timothy uh 3 and 5 I guess to have a form of godliness what is a form of godliness but not having the power thereof and the situation exists there these are ones that go about doing this creep into houses they doing they lead captive silly women all like that that's certainly not God kind of godliness is it but remember how we were bringing out you say well they have a form of godliness the kind o priest did right you could not condemn the kind o priest of anything Jesus never condemned him of anything did did Jesus tell Nicodemus any of his faults am I right now he didn't tell Nicodemus any faults he had why cuz he didn't have any his only fault was that he needed to be born again right right see then that way you can look at it and see that Jesus wasn't not condemning him for his life because his life was right right see you can have a form of godliness you can act like God you can be forgiven I mean forgive people and be great and have a great nature about you and all kind of things and you look at the kind old priest and look how great he was you know but then Jesus comes along plats a rope together runs them out of the temple but just remember now he was God right amen you say well the nature of God wasn't displayed that day that was the nature of a man no that was the nature of God because he said you make my house A din of Thieves let me set quote brother random you know what he become by doing that you know what brother R said that Jesus become what he done a deacon you need that quote he said he become a deacon you know why cuz he he's supposed to take care of everything doing his office and things all right you see the message has given us the answers to a lot of the questions we thought about all right and what about a God that is so great of a God that could utterly destroy a whole nation men women children babies and everything wipe them out that's right but yet he's God now who can condemn him but to our eyes the kind o priest was a better guy he had more godliness the way we think than Jesus had right but that won't work that's right see his godliness was without power without the love of God without the strength of God without the virtue of God that's right he had natural virtue that's right Blasphemous name says you can have it statue perfect man says you can have natural virtues and things but we need it with God and other words we don't need a knowledge until we first get a virtue that's right then we need knowledge am right well but I want I'm coming up this way come on quit playing G games you can play games and say when a baby's born it's got everything that'll ever had amen but it ain't grown enough to use it all right so don't play with the games with me or saying well when I got born again I had these things in a potential okay we'll go along with you if you'll go along with me on one thing a potential is not a real thing if a potential is never developed into a full thing it is not real right so we don't play with words we take it straight that's right and try to comprehend what is being said all right so we come and the prophet said we come all the way up here now he's expecting us to be perfect you remember that Matthew 5:48 be therefore perfect oh but it's none of us perfect we're just forgiven you see that's carnal mankind right come on if you're forgiven like I said I talking about brother collie I said now brother collie I can say brother colie robbed the bank today well he didn't rob the bank he's perfect he ain't guilty he's perfect perfect doesn't just mean you done it and then are forgiven come on we got the message go into invisible Union on the message of justification right come on and what does he say on the invisible Union of justification you start off chopping off your pie sin that's fine but after while it comes what it says though you never done it that's right that's when he puts in the SE of forgi but what about the lies part we don't study that part of the future of the invisible Union going to where he said the real you never did do it that's right amen now who's the real you right the god that's living in you is a real you right so that's why a believer in a born again believer is perfectly totally sinless that's right that don't mean we don't do wrong right we do that every day cuz that's the human elements but inside of us is eternal life and that's what he's doing inside of us now adding the word to push out to bring these virtues into being all right now so we're up to that point of thinking and see I want to drop back though cuz I want you to think on these things and I'll try to run through them in a hurry and we don't have to read them but we'll if they throw them up then you'll be able to read it on Blasphemous names paragraph 135 brother Brandon says these virtues all right without see Gifts of those but those gifts of God without these virtues in them make a stumble block to the unbeliever what if GI see we want the gifts without the giver that's the next quote see that's on debate on tongue that we want to have gifts without the giver and that's what Pentecost not throwing off on them that's what they come up with was gifts and that's what gets in the way see a gift will get in your way Brother Don can tell you about a man that at his work he's been healed of different things but now how you going to tell him he's a sinner he's going to tell you all of the healing that happened to him and he's going to look at you and say you ever been healed you going to throw it right in your face cuz that's a gift amen right see gifts are the worst thing in the world to people because how are you going to condemn somebody with a gift come on folks get serious gifts and callings the Bible said is what without repentance outside of repentance you don't repent to get a gift you're born with a gift I was I born with a gift to gab it took 20 years to get that out because in my early life I was the most shameful person you ever seen when you were talking to me I was you you've seen them right you talk to some people there they come look at you a little well because they embarrassed and that's the way I was but then God got a hold of that and he changed it whether you want to call it a Gift of Gab that's all right no problem it works anyway so who's worried about it but see gifts and callings are without repentance you can have all of those gifts and still not be right now here's the one that I quote a lot so to go ahead with number four let's see yeah let's read this one look at number four which is the Harvest Time preached in 1964 watch him now watch this point and read it real careful notice if Satan fails here in other words he's explaining Satan trying to get you okay read it notice if Satan fails here then he'll try his second scheme on you I read it get you to dis believe the word right if he can get you that way just believe the word go to the Seminary if that don't work then watch him he'll try the next a scheme if he can't get you off the word by sending you to school send you to denominational this that and the other he goes to the secondary now watch him what it is he'll try the next to scheme now here is where you want to be real careful and just set for another five minutes on this part if you will then he makes you a supernatural offer now Satan can't get you off the word and you stay with it he'll offer you a supernatural offer now that's what your Prophet is saying now I'm going to come back to all this just before closing if he can't tempt you away from the word no I'm going to stay with the word then he'll give you a supernatural offer and we're talking about Satan right look what he said he said I'll tell you what you remember this is what happened to Jesus fall down jump down the angel to B the up let you hurt you you know and all the remember that was in Satan is in Temptation I'll tell you what you get up here and dive off the temple and bring back up see show the people that you can do something than Supernatural and that was the temptation of the Lord Jesus right boy got them there now watch this this is it watch when you get to the end where this temptation come maybe he might let some of you speak in tongues think you got it that's right right now watch him they going to give you a supernatural offer right or he might even let you prophesy right though it not be with the word see because people don't care look I've seen people stand up and prophesy was as contrary to the word as the East is from the west but now you think you can tell that person there no I forget it see it's a word that you live by look them Supernatural gifts everybody a ha haa Supernatural gifts Satan can just hand them out by the handful Satan he said certainly that don't mean one thing y but brother so and so he got a gift praise God gifts are call into without repentance amen praise the Lord with this brother but he's got a gift to do this out of the other praise God I'm going to relate a story that we were sitting in a certain place one time and this man used his gift as a sister walked by he used his gift and he said so and so right in front of everybody which to me was very out you know uncal for he he could approach her personally but he made a statement the sister came to me and she said brother Dale she said what the brother said he said how come every time I see you he said I think of baby clothes well what does that mean to a unwed girl especially a girl that's own up in age maybe in her 30s you know maybe even old at that time I don't know exactly maybe younger whatever she was she wasn't married we knew the whole story the brother said how come I when I see you I think of baby clothes so the sister came to me later and she said brother Dale she said I want you to know one thing that there ain't no problems you know she's right she's virgin she was right she said the only thing is I work at a baby clothes Factory all right now what am I going to do serious I love the brother still no problems nothing whatsoever didn't condemn and didn't holler at him I just went to him this brother won't talk to you I said remember the other night when you said that every time that girl went across in front of you you saw baby clothes he said yeah I said brother there's no problem problem I said she worked at a baby clothes Factory well I eniz his gift didn't pick up that fact it picked up something he knew something in relation but he didn't have wisdom with his gift irregardless of anything else you said you mean you would be willing to talk to somebody that's your Elder that was in the message and under brother around his ministry at that You' talk to him to tell him that he wasn't right I don't see why you wouldn't are we going to a seniority you know well brother so and so you can't say nothing to him because he was ordained by the prophet if he's wrong he's wrong that's right what's the difference come on you see but we don't want it that way brother BR said he'd be glad when the bride would stand up and say you're not teaching it like like Paul said it well isn't it something in this day we ought to be able to stand up and say you're not saying what brother brandom said I don't care who is who the person is wrong is wrong but see what is God doing Satan can pass out Supernatural gifts you said I don't understand that forget it I don't either but the prophet said it and I believe it right amen cuz remember he was the anointed sherff that Stood Beside the Lord that's one thing you always remember he was those sign he knew all about all of this he was greater than in that extent than any anybody there other than Michael Michael was the only one that could control him and threw him out of Heaven see all right and see Michael was Christ all right but you see now I'm off of trying to help the visitors now down to us so listen Satan can pass out Supernatural gifts but we think well we've got this and we got that we do this we do that the gifts without the virtues or a stumble block that's why he said it we always quote it stumbling block but it says stumble block there okay just in case somebody don't take one but he didn't say that the way the prophet said okay I'll say it the way the prophet said it stumble block what is a stumble block stumbling block but listen what about would God allow these things to happen sir now remember you have come up through virtue knowledge to know that God's word cannot be contradictory you know he can't say something here and something over here and then that would bring Temperance self-control upon us and it would bring us to patience to we WR around and said patience with God not just patience with one another he said patience with God he said when God tells you so and so he said you wait that's right patience with God you mean God would allow Satan to be able to deceive the people through gifts well I just can't see a god like that boy you you just don't see God like I see him I know that cuz when you talk about being God you talk about a lovey doy granddaddy old guy that won't condemn us for being wrong and problems with it he loves us so much yeah but we're the Bride of Jesus Christ you remember the other week when I gave out those quotes where the Prophet said two times in our thus sayith the Lord there'd be a persecution we know the bride doesn't go through tribulation come on get that out but he said there'd be a persecution all right now you said but no I'm not looking forward to it I just know he said it he said Keep Your Homes belong to the Catholic church I didn't make them things well I don't don't brother I just don't think that God let his bride go through that you'd sure would be in bad shape in the Dark Ages wouldn't you when he allowed women to stand and them rip the baby out of their stomach and throw it to the Hogs you should sure wouldn't fit there too good you better thank God you're here now come on brother Rand on the message God of this evil age this evil age is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve that she is not that type of a woman she will be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was was Tried by the word and Adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever see but look that's number six drop back to five we've heard this scripture but do you read it like that Deuteronomy 13 if there arise now we we we quote the scripture that if a prophet comes and give you a sign you're supposed to believe the prophet Propet right that's a scripture I forgot what that one is but that is a scripture that's what God said about it we to believe that Prophet because he gave the signs and the things thank God but now look at this if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a Wonder now watch him and the sign or wonder come to pass other words he says here I got 10 people laying in caskets and when I speak it they're going to raise from the dead what are you going to do oh that has to be of God read the rest of the scripture and the sign and wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us serve them what is other gods trinities are right yeah come on we got trinities we T but what about the people of this message brother R said this and brother said this and we believe this and we believe that and he said other gods they made brother brandom God right look what it says Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that Prophet now this is what I love cuz look what God will do are that dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God proveth you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul now that's Bible he's going to allow things to happen that's right 40 something years ago I said you think this is coming but I said one of these days called brother R may I quote him he said it'll come to a date the Methodist and Baptist and all them are Healing The Sick a direct quote come on they're Healing The Sick what are you going to do you go right over there and today you'll probably be some miracle happen in that church right across there well I guess we don't have nothing cuz we ain't got what they got what going on over there that's no problem that's no trouble go worry what do you think I'm not trying to run nobody I I'm just telling the truth that's right but see if he takes you to another God another denomination another idea or opinion and it says that God allowed these to come among you to prove you have you ever noticed this quote now we know God is all knowing god right he knows everything before the world ever begin all that but why would brother R make this statement he said he tried Moses watch him he said because he didn't want to get down to the Red Sea and find out he had the wrong man that's a paraphrase but it's very very close you mean God didn't know Moses would do why did he try Moses to let Moses find out who he was why is he trying us not to prove brother Brandon was right but to see whether we'll take it or not well that brother remember he gave you two things if you won't fall off the word you remember the quote back up above if you won't go off the word what'll he do he'll send you a supernatural offer well brother Dale brother called me one time he had back Sid he was a preacher and he called me he said brother Dale I don't understand it he said I know I'm backslid that's what he said he said I know I'm backlit I'm not living right he said I get sermons just like I did when I was serving the lord he said why would that work like that I said because the Bible says gifts and callings are without repentance I said then he'll give you the gift is I the gift will work you so you mean God would beat that away now what are you bringing all this out of it brother Dale I'm bringing it out for the basis of one thing brother Brown said we come all the way up to Godliness before we got to be like God that's right come all the way up to Godliness before he expects us to be perfect that's what your Prophet said now it's in the Statue of perfect man so now when we come to brotherly kindness in a minute think about it he's let us come all this way before he requires brotherly kindness now come on get the point what does he say the prophet said he come out of this way before he requires that we be perfect what is he talking about your Prophet always taught that the new birth makes you just as perfect as God is amen eternal life in your soul makes you just as perfect why because it is God that's right but now he requires us to come to perfection you remember what we brought out to in definitions of the word Perfection What Be You therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven perfect means complete in a full age that's right just the same as Paul saying in Hebrews 6 And1 he just got two and five declaring that babies need milk but those that are are of to eat meat are of those of strong because they've exercised their their faith they're doing then he declares it in chapter 61 and says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundations of dead works and of Eternal judgment was Paul saying we're going to leave all of these things no come on what kind of a carnal mind have you got that's right he was saying put these place things in order that's right get it settled that there's no judgment for the bride amen but get it settled that they can be a judgment to the world and that judgment is eternal because God made the judgment and you can't change the Judgment once it's made so then it's right Eternal judgments and baptisms and why don't we read the Bible that's it so you come all the way up statue of perfect man you come all the way up to Godliness then you're required to be perfect Paul is explaining the same thing therefore leaving the principles of doctr of let us go on to perfection what Perfection perfect means of full grown or age why is it as we were talking about last night why is it in Hebrews 1140 they without us cannot be made what perfect what does that mean are we going to get them up and preach something to them no we're going to bring them to a full age cuz in the resurrection and Rapture they're going to be to a full age not at everybody we talking about last night everybody won't be the same no because it's meant to be that way but you'll bring them to a completion why because the holy ghost that started in them by New Birth brings you to a completion through the bride in the end time all right so then and what is it in brotherly kindness the prophet said on what let's see the statue of perfect man 3:41 he said these Fellers are not required what these Fells required these Fells are not required what these Fells are required why cuz Luther met his and took it and stopped on that of that y shall live by faith he's not required to come to a change of the body but you and I are that's why there waiting on you and I Amen brother R said God's waiting on you and I so let's don't blame god well God just ain't never give that to me have you made yourself available I ain't going out there I might get confused don't worry about honey you already are yeah but if I went out there and listen to Brother D I might get confused honey you already are confused where would the truth confuse anybody that's right yeah would he is so deep to he's this that or the other I wish you could understand what being deep is okay you know that being deep is the shallowest thing that's ever been in the world that's my definition of deep brother brand was very deep you know what he was the most shallow man that I've ever seen as he could explain the Bible right not that he was shallow in that he didn't have anything no but he took all he had and brought it to a place to where he could talk our language is that not what the scripture says about Jesus that the Common People heard him gladly why not because he could explain the vs the plagues the Thunders the this that or the other but because he could bring the gospel down to a simple language that it could be comprehended what are we supposed to be go ahead to number nine we'll pick this up and look what he says CU we're going to come down to brotherly kindness you better remember one thing too because like I told you there was a brother came through one time brother Mo was preaching on the Statue of perfect man and he he was telling the brother and the brother said don't tell me let me figure it all out and I'll come back and preach it 6 months later he came back ain't joking you know 6 months later he came back and he preached because of a quote that he had brother brandham says the brotherly kindness age is takes the Rapture now this is a Ministry I'm thought not throwing off on God help me I'm just telling it like it is to make it sensible to you you know what he preached what do does the word Philadelphia mean what does the word Philadelphia mean brotherly love right the City of Brotherly Love is Philadelphia what it Pennsylvania is that what what state is it in brotherly love and so he preached that if if Brotherly Love was where he at then rash are going to take place in sixth Church AG they spent six months studying that I happen to remember that a brother two sent three days studying on Daniel 70 weeks and made his own drawing he wasn't the other guy that made it but he followed right with him yeah why you want make another one brother randam already Dr it that's right but listen what is he saying brotherly kindness now that's a good one right there the sixth seventh see all right adding brotherly kindness all right when you get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter now you say now watch what I'm getting at you come up to to Godliness before you're required to be perfect you come to Godliness before it's required that you be like God you come to Godliness and Perfection before you come to brother kindness so it's not brotherly kindness of Philadelphia well that's just a good old brother he just never says anything about anybody he's a wonderful old brother ain't he nature given brother around and said y that's what he says look what is brotherly kindness all right brotherly kindness all right when you get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter now how many's ever done that you differ with somebody if you ever put yourself in their place have you ever thought about oh brother Perry green made a statement years ago he said don't say nothing about somebody cuz he's quoting brother Brown until you walked in your shoes and that just stuck with me you know you realize that I'm talking to people out on internet probably that have never heard that you need these virtues because their pastors never taught them that well what can they understand about what we're talking about but just remember they've never heard it oh that gets me good I I'm I'm sorry I'm human I'm sorry but how many times have I ever said it this way takes you six months for me to pound into to you that you need to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but the first person you see out on the street your church wrong you ever been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you don't you going to die and go to hell and you come back and you say well brother you shouldn't have been that well I got it to start with when I first started I got it I said 6 months it took me to get you in the water but see that's the why we think isin it so is it with brotherly kindness see well I've got brotherly kindness have you got what the prophet calls it when you get that brotherly kindness you put yourself in his place I don't see why y'all can't believe that I I believed it a long time put yourself in his place come on we're going to read right hope we get it my brother sinned against me said Peter shall I forgive give him he said seven times a day that's wonderful ain't he's quoting scripture back to the Lord Jesus what Jesus say Jesus said 70 * 7 that's 490 that's why you're Daniel 70 weeks has the 490 heers to it that's why all of that is in there cuz Jesus said for 70 * 7 that's 490 now he also adds right in there if you know he said it again if you ask you that's the best way brother Rand had defining it 70 * 7 is 490 again if you ask it well I'm up to it now one more time one more time and no he said again if you ask you brotherly kindness and you see if a brother is All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see no see be kind to him go anyhow bless God you don't agree with me you ain't have nothing to do with him where would I be if I have said that years ago and I know you don't like the rest of it where would you be I told you one time God told me he said you can do in a certain situation he said anytime you want to and I never done that yet well if he tells me I can do it I'll just go do it there was a lot involved and I didn't do it okay brotherly kindness Brothers All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see be kind to him go anyhow going up to the next uh let's see where' we get to what number we on I've done lost it okay we go roll it up to work we we can obtain now watch him we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another now watch him cuz this will relate to The Headstone watch the statement he makes we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another see but to maintain it in a group of people there's some of you that won't even speak to the other person cuz you know what cuz they ain't spoke to you they didn't speak to me and I'll speak to him oh that's wonderful whetherly kindness right we go to some of these meetings and there's a lot of brothers in those meetings that wouldn't walk across the street to shake my my hand but I go to every one of them and I grab them and I hug their neck I guess I'm called a hugger in the message go I go to them and I hugged her neck and I said brother I love you like I was telling them last night a certain brother in this message I won't call his name or the church either but he was wrong and I went to him and told him he was wrong and he got offended with me and I went back and I said brother I'm sorry I believe what I told you is the truth but I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings over this matter he got up in front of a congregation one day and he said to thank a man that would tell me I was wrong and show me I was wrong but said yet he would apologize for talking to me I didn't have no problem with that I don't have no problem with saying I'm sorry I ain't saying I'm sorry if I'm right remember may I quote brother per green as a quote okay cuz he said brother brandham said it I believe it he said he was talking to brother brandham one day and he said brother brandham told him said brother Perry he said from where you stand he said to where I stand he said everything you do is sin now some of you may have heard him because I'm 99% sure he said in Atlanta but he said brother brandham said but from where I stand to where God is everything I do is sin I believe that whether it ever happened or not I believe it not because so and so said so and so no because it's truth just remember when you're looking down on somebody there's always somebody looking down on you never forget that might change your thoughts all right go ahead and pull it back up where are we why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him here at the altar as you will tonight your fellowship with him you shook his hands you worship with him he's your brother wait an hour in Jamaica when a certain brother passed away I regretted that so much if there was any possibility I asked him was there any possibility for me to go get a flight home and they said doubtful that he wouldn't be able to get you home I wanted to go to the man's funeral I was not able to I regret that till this day I regret that because you broke bread with him at the altar you will deny you fellowship with him you shook his hands you worship with him he's your brother and he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with because you're just kind of stay which you ought to do but shine him a little you ever been that way you ever been to where you know you just kind of then you you just kind of you know want to get around when I see that and I see them brothers and sisters don't want to shake my hand you're going to shake my hand I'm going to run you down right well I being arrogant okay what are you if that's being arrogant we got that problem what's yours but not wanting to do it okay no problem what your you ought to do but shun him a little but in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it would just nearly kill you or that sister he said I'm an old man I was young and old I've seen it down to the age do that he people say I just won't have any won't have no more to do with him and something happened to that man it nearly kills him he thinks oh God I let my precious brother go without making friends with him you see see see it's brotherly love it looks like it WS stick but it does the honey sticks okay what's he talking about the honey sticks it won't but the honey sticks go ahead to the next one CU I've lost my page that supposed to be reading to you on this is from the message why I'm against organized religion see if what is purposed to to the church the life that was in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still until you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue all of these things and Temperance and things and godliness and brotherly kindness all these things that's required of you what would you be if you would like brother brandom you ever thought about that he said stand there and that person hug your neck and say I love you he said f a knife sticking in your back I don't want to know that Bo I'd like to know how many Church really loves me I don't want to know nothing about that I want to think everybody does come on look and godliness brotherly kind and all these things that's required of you requirement means remember I gave you the thing where it's a commission these virtues is a commission or a commandment from God I gave it to you the other day out a statue of perfect man no matter what you've done no matter how much you shouted how many churches you've joined how many feathers you've pinned into yourself don't do it wait till gely from your heart you can forgive till in your heart you have brotherly kindness no matter if they pull a handful of beard from one side you turn the other cheek with sweetness see until those virtues no matter what they say to you no matter what listen all right what is he going on to I don't have time to let me preach just a little bit okay and and you know it's there cuz I'll do the best I can quoting so they can pull this up and let you do it uh brother brandham in speaking on a message right after the statue of perfect man which is two or three days later he preaches a message called Blasphemous names and in that message he begins with telling a dream that a sister had and that she was worried whether she had the holy ghost or not and as she was concerned about those things she laid down on a new folder of thing she had a dream she goes to brother brandham tells him the dream you know writes a letter I think to him and then he refers back to it when he gets to this message you know and refers back to her and the dream you know now he says in he said I don't have the paper she wrote it on I'm I'm a little bit beyond that and I hope you are God brother around says when you tell a prophet a dream he says he sees the dream he'll say you'll say so and so and so he say why did you leave this out he said he sees the Dream well he's telling the sister about the dream and she saw this place upon a mountain or like upon a thing and she sees a rock Box sitting in in the top of the mountain and this is not Junior Jackson's dream we'll get to that one later all right if we have time all right and he's covering this that it's a rock Box sitting in the top of the mountain he covers that every Church age has a rock box that dream was a he said it is a spiritual dream he said it identically goes with the message he preached of the stature of a perfect man all right so then they go together to make the same point so read them together all right so in that mean he got to it and he says that when he saw that he said this man was standing there and said he had this thing and he would holding water and he poured over in to this rock box and he said it was boiling out all of the trash and it was running out he says that water was the Holy Spirit and he goes on to say that that was the Holy Spirit and nothing will hold it he said nothing will hold the Holy Spirit he said you don't put it in churches you put it in individuals right he said c it'll run out all right he says then he the man went and got she was concerned about because it was boiling over the man went and got some honey and poured it into the Rock box and he said that honey represents brotherly kindness see now so none of these others would hold on even though you come up to Great godliness they won't hold on to that point but when it come to that little rock box he said that honey represented the holy represented brotherly kindness and he said it held said it looked like it wasn't but said it held together he said that's brotherly kindness the age that you're living in all right see then because it's a restoration now listen so therefore the rock the latterday Pentecostal Church which has received this is paragraph 121 of Blasphemous night received the Holy Spirit they did at the first all down Through the Ages they received the Holy Spirit but not in the measure that they have it now because it's a restoration of the first all right see so it's been the Holy Ghost and every age and that Holy Ghost it is the word he said it was the messenger now I'm jumping a whole lot but the messenger to the church paragraph 123 24 of blasphemia names the messenger to the church pouring the message into the church okay what was the water that was being poured into that the message this message is to boil out all of our unbelief right he said I just got to telling you of Brotherly kindness the age we live in now all right see then when it does he poured out onto that church and his brotherly kindness to Honey now we pick up this evening a little more on the TI together with brother Jackson's dream that he has that brother random verifies because listen I ain't just quoting to you you can do what you want to let's see he says paragraph 114 of Blasphemous 9 now here is the interpretation of her dream a rock Box water was boiling out the message boiling out all the trash then you add brotherly kindness Brotherly Love said it looked like it was going to SW swell and bust but said it didn't said it held we see that's a very important thing for the hour to think about that the brotherly kindness of this messenger pouring the message in will bring that brotherly kindness into being to where it'll hold you got a lot more you go through blasphemist names you go through it what he's talking about the Rock Box confession the Holy Ghost he said can be preached in these places but that's good or bad he said because you got Renegades you got everything therefore the rock this latterday Pentecostal Church the Bride of Jesus Christ there's a brotherly kindness that's expected in you and I he said why would you go brother brandom he realized that he would go a lot of times and preach when he knew the people there only had him for the signs and the Wonders they only had him for showing the gifts they didn't believe what he said what about the 300 ministers that he went and talked to about baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said they all wanted tapes he said we never seen a one none of them ever got tapes and things but did brother Brandon quit going no he went what' you call him brotherly kindness the brotherly kindness would come to a position that God would require this brotherly kindness before he would cap off the whole thing that brotherly kindness would be the honey that would be there sure there's Honey in the Rock my brother we talk about brotherly kindness he said we we can have brotherly kindness yes because see some people have brotherly kindness one to the other but he says as a group this little what about this this little group brotherly kindness no Facebook amen Facebook telephone right I don't how no Facebook we just taking prayer request when you're sitting there yakking about somebody when the prophet said don't do that he said pray for them brother Dale just as guilty as anybody but you know for certain the Facebooks don't work and you know for certain the telephone don't work too good because I feel so bad a lot of time because people will call me and Teggy will say later said what they call you about I said I don't know they didn't tell me you I didn't ask them you come in my my office don't come in I want to tell the tales about this we go get the other person okay we go get the other person I've been in there right lot of you know that right I don't go in there by myself some of you sitting here they've been in my office years back when something would come up and i' take you in office and say okay but we're going to have a witness we're going to have somebody else sitting here we're not going to talk about this and you better be ready to prove what you're talking about cuz I told one brother in the office in front of everybody else I said because of your P record I do not believe you are saying the truth I've got to be plain right I'm the pastor I got to be plain not arrogant plain I want to tell you about so and so come on folks we've had some leave because we didn't go along with their Yaky Yaky Yaky about everybody but did that stop from Yaky Yaky yaking about it no they still Yaky Yaky they still call you just remember what I'm saying if you sit there and listen to Somebody yak yak you are just as guilty as the person that has called you and you saywell I didn't do nothing wrong I just listen why didn't you say I don't want to hear it remember that's my brother that's my sister you're talking about come and tell me when lady told me one day boy she was chewing me out call me up chewing me out about certain thing I said ma'am are you willing to face that person that you just saying that about that kind of quiet I said because if you don't don't talk to me about it if you're willing we'll go right now and meet that person and we'll talk about it but you better be ready to talk but if not shut it up that's why my phone doesn't ring all the time but a lot of yours do have you ever done this somebody says here's what brother Brown said I can find these quotes if you want he said somebody comes to you and tells you about somebody he said let's pray have you prayed for the brother maybe I better put it that way to get exact he said have you prayed for the brother or sister what should we first do wouldn't that put Facebook on really good you turn it on over morning it says up the top don't say nothing until you pray ah come on fol somebody calls you up and start talking to say we're not let's pray let's pray yeah but but that's not the definition of Brotherly kindness that I've got well that's the Holy Ghost definition that's right now you tell me it ain't I just read to you and there's a lot more brother run says about brotherly kindness we'll use it in another message on down the road cuz remember you're going to have brotherly kindness then the holy spirit will come down and seal you that's right that's why there's not a lot of seiling right I don't see why God let this run like half to try us come on Brothers come on musician to try us to see what we'll do to see if we'll stay with the word well you just don't leave me no good I just have a good time on the phone talking I'm not gossiping I'm not gossiping
