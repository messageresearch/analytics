we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for all your blessings on us and Lord what you've done for us Lord that we're able to Lord walk in this world it's so dreary and Lord it is so dark lord but there's great light Lord wherever you are Lord and Lord we're just so thankful for the light of your word Lord that we can see our way Lord did you lead us and guide us in all things and father we just pray tonight you just come help us tonight Lord you just take the words that we say or just anoint us to speak and to hear Lord and you just have your way with us this evening we just pray for each one that has a need Lord you know what's on each heart what's in each life Lord and Lord we just commit ourselves to you we just pray that you bless the bride around the world Lord there's many that are sick and Afflicted Lord and we just pray that you just keep your hand upon them touch them anoint them Lord you said you sent your word and you healed them and you delivered them from destruction and Lord we believe that and we we agree with our brothers and sisters Lord that are in a battle Lord that are need a touch from you Lord and we just believe Lord that you'll go and touch them tonight Lord Lord that the enemy has to back up because he doesn't have a place to stand Lord and we call for it you know we just commit ourselves to you tonight we thank you for all things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen first second Corinthians chapter five very familiar scriptures says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be closed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do grown being burdened not for that which for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath brought us for the same self-sane thing as God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefore we also we are also confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord and they didn't put that up there I'm sorry I forgot that I was just I got to reading and wasn't paying attention I know I only had one one three four up there let's go to First Corinthians very familiar scripture verse 13 says but I would not have you ignorant Brethren concerning which them are concerning them which are asleep that you saw or not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep before the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be called up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words and then Romans 8 28 very familiar says for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose amen you may be seated and there's many things that in and are I was kind of continuing on from what we've been we were talking about earlier and to know you know Paul talks about to know for we know and we know and he also says it's important that I'd have you would not have you ignorant Brethren of these things and we know Paul talks about different places in the scripture and I just want to look at a few things tonight but you know there's there's many things that we can look at in the in the scripture from from the this uh rating and you know there's there's many things that people uh look at and you know when we look at these scriptures here you know we know from the beginning you know God had a had a plan and a purpose and you know God God made man in his own image and in his likeness and you know he had a he had a plan and a purpose that he wanted man to fulfill and you know the the you know the way God created man he put man on free moral agency and we know how God allowed man to do his own thing and do his own go his own way because that was part of God's plan for God to manifest all of his attributes because if you know if nobody was ever sick he couldn't be a Healer and if nobody ever got lost he couldn't he couldn't be a savior but we know how God had all these attributes that he wanted to be displayed and you know he set it up not that you know many people when you talk to him and you try to explain the the plan and the purpose of God you know it's either well God doesn't know anything or he knows so much but he doesn't know everything but you know because people say well the Lord knows all things he's like well do you really believe that because when you begin to express things because let me ask you a question about foreknowledge and predestination and then all of a sudden you get this pushback it's like well now did God know everything or he didn't know everything either he knew what he was doing ahead of time and he knew what you were going to do before you done it before he created the world when he was Elohim when he was self-existing when he was by himself he knew what was going to take place or he didn't then he would know that he's not forcing any one of us through a tube he's not dragging us kicking and screaming but he knew that if the word passed our way we'd receive it he made the word available to us so then God's not a respecter of person so the scripture is true where he said that God was willing that none should perish but that all might come to repentance so he made a way for everybody to come the problem is is people won't accept it you know many times when people people begin to look into in the Book of Genesis when it talks about Cain and Abel and you know many people stumble at even people in this message they stumble at that and it's like it's to me it's a very simple concept of the scripture God told uh Cain what to do he come by his own way come by his own thought by his by his intellectual thinking he's like well this is what God would like but that's not what God required that's not God's plan it required blood there had to be blood because it was blood that caused the fall it had to be blood to take it back so there had to be without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sins so there had to be blood that was shed and by Revelation Abel knew what sacrificed to offer but Kane didn't have that but Cain had the way presented to it the way was made for him because God told him said listen if you will do as your brother you don't even have to know what to how understand all this just do as your brother because see the the problem that Cain had Cain could not walk by faith because that's what it required it's not understanding it's by faith I'm going to take God at his word that's what faith is taking God at his word and doing what he said and so when Cain with he did not take God at his work and so he was like no I'm not going to do because I've made my choice make my decision this is what I'm going to do and God said listen he said either either you follow this or sin lies at the door and that was your choice and he made it and every person every one of us here throughout the whole world we've all had that choice somewhere along the way God has made the choice has made the opportunity we make our choice where we've heard the gospel once or we've heard it ten thousand times we make our choice and that's what too much to those who have been given little little is required but to those have been given much much is required so each one of us have to make our decision and we all have to go by the things that that we do and we have to pay the consequences of it but God God is gracious and when we do make a mistake there is a blood atonement to cover our sins and we can always go to the blood there's always a way made but we have to take that uh atonement we can't because he doesn't force that on us that's our that's our choice and just you know it's so gracious to think of of or of how God is with us that he has made a way for us and we have to receive this it's it's a wonderful thing but the world is not there's many people that will not accept it but that's that's their that's their loss that's the condition of the world is in but you know God God made man to to fulfill his plan and and you know the fall took place and and God made a way for them to come back in to Fellowship there was a way made and you know and he was wanting to bring him back into fellowship and you know to express his attributes and you know there was a way made that we can come back from where we came from if we came from God we have a purpose brother Brown said we're every part of the creation of God is here to fulfill their purpose everybody that was created all things were created that was created for a purpose and so everything has to fulfill its purpose and brother Branham said he said for every every part of the creation of God that fulfills its purpose he said it lives again because he said when you see that when job was speaking of the tree he said when you see the tree and it blossoms and and the leaves and all these things but then it comes in the and the leaves fall off and and the life leaves and everything looks so dead and dried up but he saw the life return the life came back on display why because it fulfilled its purpose through the through the spring through the summer through the fall but there was another spring coming and when he saw it when job saw a man he's like man gives up The Ghost and he goes in the ground but will man live again but you know God began to speak to job and tell him and show him give him a revelation so as as we know here in the scripture that God had had man and he give him away back to to him back to the place where he came from that's what and that's that's our opportunity today the same thing if we come from God we're going back to God there's a way made for us to go back and you know the scripture says that you know man was put down here on the earth and you know we just we're just here for a short period of time and you know we realize that as as I believe it was brother Dutch you know it was taken of you know we're only we're just Spiritual Beings here for in a human experience a human time here but then we're going back to where we came from you know we're just here for this portion of time but we got to go back and we've got to make that decision of which way we want to go because if we're a part of God then we go back to God and I thank God he's made the way but you know so when he made this way that we're only here for a period of time and then and then time is over with and you know we're only here for this period of time that that while we're here where we are to prepare ourselves because this is just the window dressing this is just the rehearsal it's just going to soon pass away but you know because we we can get so tied down to the world and and the things that we have to deal with day to day and not realize there's a greater thing waiting on us than this you know many times we we just see we just see these three dimensions and we're Bound by these three dimensions and and many times we fail to see the greater things that are coming you know because you know that's what I'm waiting on I'm looking forward because there's coming a day when when all this will pass away and you know we don't know we don't know when our time's going to be up but we're promised that our time's going to be up you know we would you know there's there's no uh expiration date stepped on anybody's foot so you don't know but God knows God knows when our time will be up and it'll be and you know God and and His Infinite Wisdom not not for us to figure these things out we just know it's a fact that you know as brother random said he said if we if we live through the night we'll outlive many 16 year olds we'll outlive many babies we don't know if we're going to wake up in the morning wait not we're not promised them all we're not promised the rest of the night but now is the day of salvation now is the time to prepare to get ready and now is the time for us to make sure that we are ready to go because everything else is is is insignificant because all this will pass away but there's only one thing because what what part of God the word of God what you take of the word what the having the life of God inside of you that's the only thing that counts what is eternal is the only thing that's important the rest of it will pass away so you know as as we begin to look here in the scripture and you know when we see that God Made A Way and and and so when God made this made a way for us to come that that God can take up residence in us that we come alienated from the life of God lost doomed on our way to hell but he made a way for us to come back and not just away but he came to live inside of us he come to take up residence inside of us he come to live inside of us that we that we it's not us living anymore it's no longer Aaron Roberts living but it's Christ Living in me that's what Paul said and and so it's not as Paul said it's no longer I that live now and it's and it's chose to be our testimony each one of us should have that same testimony it's no longer that that it's me but it's Christ Living in me and you know when we see the things that the the pressures and the problems that come to us but you know when God come to take to come up take up residence in us to live in us then God wants to display himself that we fulfill his portion his plan for our lives is to make sure that we the world gets to see who who God is because you know the the you know you can argue you can argue Theology and many things like that but you can't argue with a life and you know and so when when the when the things come our way and we have problems and and and issues and things you know when when these things come when we realize when these things take place that God has has a plan for us a purpose and he wants to make us known you know if if you I was listening to a man the other day and and he was talking about he said you know if you take if you take an orange and you squeeze that orange he said what did you get what do you what do you get when you squeeze an orange juice you know what none of y'all said juice you said orange juice why because when you squeeze an orange you don't get anything else but orange juice and brothers and sisters when God is on the inside when God has taken up resonance and we wonder why we Face problems and heartaches and troubles and trials well when the squeeze comes on then you know what it's really bad if you claim to be a believer if we claim to be children of God and when the squeeze comes on when the trials and the troubles come and the heartaches come and the disappointments come and we can people get everything else but God when you squeeze a Christian then it should be christ-like we should see they should seek Jesus Christ on display that's what God wants in this life when these things come our way we we're not we're not ever promised a Bed of Roses but when these things hit us and they come our way then you know what it's for God to get the glory and so when these things happen they come for a reason and see many things come our way and we don't we don't understand why these things happen the way they do we don't understand all these things but you know what God is in control and God God knows what's going to take place long before we ever get here and have to go through these things and I'm so glad that we have somebody that can lead us all the way and knows the answer that I can put my confidence in you know there's many times we have heartaches and problems and I was and I was listening to brother Branham and you know certain things that just stand out to me and and you know you listen to things why things happen and here in the scripture and it says you know we're not to sorrow as others which have no hope you know we're all going to have problems and sorrows and heartaches and disappointments that's life's grab bag you know you just buckle up because they're coming but the scripture tells us not to sorrow as the others because they have no hope but brothers and sisters we have all the Hope in the world we got all the hope that passes all understanding and uh I just want to read a few things here uh I love this brother Branham um there's there's a there's a lady that that brother Branham talks about and you know when I get on the other side everybody says who do you want to meet and you know there's people that I will I want to meet and everybody says I want to meet brother Branham and I want to meet Paul and I want to meet this person and I want to meet that person I tell you some of the people I want to meet I want to meet I want to meet that black sister from Memphis that stopped a plane that grounded a plane and had and told us she prayed through that she knew the prophet was coming and brother Brandon didn't know where he was going but Sheena who he was when he come walking down the street praying singing then she said good morning Parson because she said I've been waiting on you all night long because the Lord spoke to me and told me to come stand beside this fence and I've been waiting on you now that's the kind of person I want to meet I tell people the per another person I want to meet in this world I want to meet Garnet Pete Pete I tell you what for a man that's 18 years old to have that kind of effect on the profit I tell you what that's an amazing I I tell you what I would rather have a a testimony to be a a Christian that had that kind of faith had lived that kind of life and only lived to be 18 years old than to be a hundred and twenty years old and not have anything in my life and not have anything to show for it but I'd rather I'd just like just like brother Brandon said talking about Garnet say he came and he lived his life and he lived the part that he and you know he was saying you listen to brother Brown and you tell that that young man had an effect on him it touched him when he when he was giving his funeral and you listen to that it's like man if you're ever a teenager and you ever want to live a life you listen to what brother Garnet lived that's the kind of life you live that's the kind of testimony that you want to have that you can reach out you know that moves everybody hey because you know what we're not promised tomorrow we're not promised the next day you may not graduate from high school you may not ever get married you might ever do anything but you know what you can be a Christian you can show this world what a real true life of God is [Applause] and the other and this and this is the other sister that I that I I would love to meet and that's sister Bale and brother Brown talks about that he said you know she was a big sort of a heavy set black lady and brother Brown said he said always love to hear her course amens and you know and brother random was talking about she was the sister that brother random talks that tells the story about that he got the phone call and he thought it was a sister Shepard had a need and so they were praying over sister Shepherd and then brother Billy Paul calls him and says no it's not sister Shepherd it's sister bail sister Bell had a need and said well then he raced to the hospital to find her and when he got to the hospital sister Bale had already passed and brother Branham and you know when you hear these things and you know it just it stirs me so many times to hear that and you know he goes out there and you know he says you know she had this the gallbladder issue and all these things and he says he said but when we bring it to a full measure he said we have we say this God called for sister Baal and that's the way it had to be taken you see now why was it now when we look at the all the heartaches and the disappointments and all these things are happening off why was it that the message came to brother Branham that it was Sister Shepard and not sister Bale why was it that it came that it was her why did it go that way and it and brother Brown says well you know he was talking about and and when he gives when he gives the but he does her funeral and the message Expressions brother random covers that also and he says you know it he thought it was sister Shepard and he said it was Sister Bale and he said he said and to see that he said the wise Providence and plan of God before he could ever get their sister Baal had done climbed the golden stairs he said before I could get there God had plucked his rows of color to take his bouquet for the millennium before I could get there she was going to meet God God's expression of his love now many times see when we see that in our lives we don't understand that but say when God but see if we understand that all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord so if that was the case then when when God had a plan we don't see that we don't understand that why because here here's a family here's the Bell family sitting in the church brokenhearted and at the loss of their mother and you know and this in this one that had left the Tabernacle and it stirred brother around him but you know what that was God's plan God had God had a certain amount of time sister Bell was going to be here she lived her life she had a testimony and when she lived her life it was full God fulfilled she fulfilled her plan that God had for her when that was her time to go but brother Brown said see if I'd have known it was Sister Bell he said I would have probably been down there interceding on her behalf and that wasn't what God wanted why because it was time for her to go now there were times that brother round said that she had she had this issue she had been touched the Lord had healed her and administered to her and he said God had been merciful to her but you know what it came her time to leave well if it was time for her to leave then you know the one thing when it was time for her to leave then you know what she had a place to go to when this Earthly house was dissolved she had a body not made by hands Eternal in the heavens she had a place to go to that was eternal rest for her she did she laid down all of the cares and the problems and the worries and everything here and she stepped into another dimension that was greater that she couldn't even imagine how great it was and she stepped on into that Dimension and how great it was but see many times we begin to hold back and we went well why did God allow this thing to happen why did this happen why was that but see we're not supposed to sorrow Paul said not like the others why because if we understand the plan of God if we understand that God then you know what there's a place for them to go to so when they step on over and they you know what they're better off than we are then they have finished their course they run their race well praise God and you know what then yeah we have our heartaches we have our troubles we have our pain that doesn't discount any of that you know I've thought so many times that you know I would you know there's there's days you know there's days that I wake up and you know what I think man I would what I wouldn't give to see my dad again that's right you know like you know if I could just hug my dad one more time if I could just hold his hand one more time but you know when that when you get into situations like that but when you realize you know he's in a better place than I am today when you when you begin to see where where they're sitting at today then you know what then you know what if I want to honor my dad I can't I can't do anything else for him he's gone but you know the one thing that I can do when I think when I think about you know because you know we live in filio love that's what it is I mean we still have love for our family because it's not the you know just normal human love but you know when you have the love of God but you still have love for your parents you still love them but they're gone but you know the one thing that I can do to honor my my dad is I can do what he wanted what he would want me to do my if my dad could lay over the banister of time to this this evening and speak to me that he would tell me not to stop he would tell me keep going son why because it's just a little bit further but you know what you keep going you keep pressing the battle you don't stop you're not a quitter and what because that's what God has given to us is produced in US is not to be quitters not to be given not to be given up not to be compromisers but to be just fight the battle as hard as we can go down one because it won't be long I don't believe it'll be long we'll be out of here we're going to meet them they're going to come back in this dimension he'd always face them so many heartaches and pains and struggles and Brothers says you know he said you can imagine he said we fight strains and and disappointments and he talks about having all these different disappointments and and problems and he talks about he said he said no wonder I'm a neurotic or almost a one he said you got people that are calling on the phone and he said they call you all hours of the day and night and he said they're calling they're saying Lord send brother Brown because I've got a I've got a sick child or a you know a spouse that's dying or whatever and you know and he said you hang up the phone and another one calls and you and you put that one down you pick up the phone here's another one calling hey you know about all the strain and all the pressure but you know he said the only thing Eastside can do is he said I keep my eyes on Calvary he said I keep my eyes on Kevin I keep moving because he said that's what he would have me do and that's all we can do we feel we see all these things we don't understand why things happen the way they do why they why they come our way why is all these things that we have to face but you know what we keep our eyes on Calvary maybe we don't understand these things but you know what God does foreign you just hold on to what God has given you you know brother Brandon said one time he was talking about these people and you know you see these people and they hold on they have faith they take God at his word and he said there was a there was a lady she had a sick child and she kept holding on to God for for for healing and he said he said after all the time that she put in to believe in and trust in God for a healing and believing he said she had the the child end up passing away and in the midst of all that he said all that went around the country and everybody all they could do is condemn Divine Healing because that child died and brother Bradham said in the midst of the time of that child dying because that woman had had Faith she was holding On Believing for a miracle to take place in that child and it didn't ever come for her but he said in the midst of that he said the doctors have lost tens of thousands of of cases but he said he said they would dare you to stand up and call Medical Science fanaticism why because brother random said he said if I if I paid if I prayed for a hundred people tonight and every one of them died he said I'd pray for a hundred more tomorrow night why because that doesn't change the word of God because he's a Healer he's the same yesterday a day and forever and if he's ever healed one person he can still do it tonight but let me tell you you can't override the sovereignty of God but you know what we still preach that God is the Healer we don't know when to be just like you preach the message of Salvation you speak to people and you preach the word of God to them whether whether they reach it they accept it or not that's not our job and just like when we pray over the sick we don't know what's going to take place but you know what we I'm gonna hold on and I'm gonna have my faith until it comes to pass well you know what hap what happens when you come to a time in your life when there's everything goes wrong when when the when the things don't go the way that you won't want them to go what do we do then when brother Branham he was speaking of job and you know job was out there and here's here's a man a great testimony as a great man of God living lived a life and live such a life that when Satan come to God and was speaking to him about walking through in the earth and seeing all these things that God pointed job out and said have you considered my servant job there's none like him in the Earth well you know what if that was me I'd say I'll pass on that brother but you know what God had confidence in job didn't know what was going to take place job had no understanding of that but you know what God had confidence in job and when Satan come to job he says well you know you got that hedge around him you know he's like your little pet over there look at the way you treat him but he was like let me get my fingers on him I want to get a hold of him hey let me touch him for a while I promise you he'll catch you to your face he'll curse you and God had enough confidence in job he turned around and said have at him there you go lay your hands on him she can't take his life in the midst of look at job he's out there offering those sacrifices perhaps one of my children have sinned and I'm offering a sacrifice to God for my children holding the token up for his children every day many times we have we have situations we don't understand especially amongst our children like somebody said parroting ain't for the weak of heart you know you got to be you've got to be tough because let me tell you that it don't all it ain't anywhere of any bed of roses there's a lot of issues and a lot of problems but you know what God is faithful here's here's job standing in the midst of all this and all of a sudden all everything that job had all of his great possessions all of his animals are dead all of his children are dead everything is gone everything's destroyed he's got Bulls all over him but you know what he didn't understand what was going on but the one thing about job he didn't he didn't charge God foolishly he didn't he didn't he didn't understand but you know what he still had faith in God he didn't understand or the the situation he was in why everything had befallen him but you know what he still had faith in God and in the midst of all of that there he is his brother Ram said he was out there scratching those Bulls off with a piece of glass sitting on an ash Heap but you know what he didn't worry about that because he still knew inside of his heart he's thinking I'm still right with God I've still done and I was God knows the Integrity in my heart but I don't understand this now brother Brandon says this is this is from the message I know this is number one brother Graham says and he said and now we come to those places we all come and I believe today that we are gathered here for something like that same purpose we are all on the ash heaps we have our troubles our ups and downs and our bad moments and our sicknesses and our heartaches and our disappointments so we come like this of a morning this Easter morning to find words of comfort like job was trying to find from his friends none of them could give him any consolation because of his trouble they were accusing him of being a secret sinner then in the midst of all that trouble God came to his rescue so we understand that when God came when when he went through all of these things and and to understand all the issues and the problems that that job had to face and all the things that he was going through and all of this and you you see how everything had went but you know he didn't charge God foolish but but he kept holding on to the one thing that he knew God was real and God was true and he didn't understand it but you know what it never lost his faith in God to the position that he came to and you know when all when all of his the Physicians of no value showed up and you know his friends come to console him and you know then all they all they could do was accuse him and even his wife said you know why don't you just Curse God and die in all the situations that he had went through all the problems but you know what he never he never you know he never changed it he had faith in God he never lost that confidence in God he never lost who God was brother Brown says he says he said why do we why do we come to these troubles he said what makes these come he said why should a Christian ever be perplexed why wouldn't not everything just run perfect for a Christian he said but it doesn't and we know it so why why don't we have all these issues and things why because that's part of Who We Are he said he said and sometimes having we have more troubles than when we become a Christian than we did when we were sinners he said he goes you know the script says many of the afflictions are the Righteous but God delivers them out of them all so we and he said he said God promised many afflictions strange feelings and strange things that we would be beyond that would be beyond our understanding but it's always done for our good just can't understand it because if we did then we would not be of Faith to it would not be a faith to us because we would go with an understanding but we do it and we have it and we believe by faith his word and that it's going to work some good thing for us if we could grasp that today on this morning if we could grasp that that all of our troubles that there's none of us immune from them but if we could realize that those things are for our good that we understand how all these things are written they all become for our good we don't understand them all these strange things happen how everything turns out we don't we can't under you know there's no way of trying to put your finger on understanding by Logic it doesn't make sense but the great thing is is God says that your thoughts are not my thoughts and my my ways are not your ways and my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts and so when it comes to all those things and guess what we we don't we can't figure those things out but the good thing is we can take it by faith that we can trust him by faith how all these trials and tribulations they come they're they're more precious than gold how all these things come we don't understand why these things have happened the way they do but your brother Branham said when when you have when you become a God's Property when you become a child of God and he said he said he said do our confession through in him he said then all of a sudden it brings these things to come and and we have these we have these trials and all these problems come our way but we realize that we don't sometimes we don't realize that is the promise of God we have the promises of God in our lives but we don't realize it as being a promise of God we just see it as problems you know brother Brandon said one time he said you know he said we pray for priests and comfort we go to God and we're wanting peace and comfort and you know what we get we get trials and tribulations not realizing that is the peace and comfort that we get we don't see it that way but that's what God has for us he said he said that every trial that comes our way he said is is put upon us he said to perfect us for his glory he said it's to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than we he was before the trial come he said I want I want to join in this morning with job to say he said I've lived long enough to know that's the truth I have seen it in my own life that every time great City a great situation Rises that I can't get around it or under it or over it God makes a way and comes out glorious he said I just wonder how his grace ever does it but he does it and remember in all these things Satan tries to make us nervous and upset us to get us to think oh why did this happen why couldn't I have been like this but see if we get to looking at our situations and not looking at the promises of God that we're not looking at what God wants us to look at then we're not putting our because you know I'll I'll put Joe could look at was all those bulls and that Ash Heap and all the different things that he was facing but you know there was something that he won't God wanted him to see who he was and God was working in his life and he said if we could only see these great things and he said he said brother said these crucial times in her life he said he said they press us on to the sacred Sands it brings us to the place where we're on the back side of the desert when we don't understand the plan of God but that what brings us to that place because God is working in our lives when we go through these things and and you see how all this is just all you go through you look at the life of Moses and and all the things that he was that he had to go through and he had to face and all the all the issues you know when you see a man that was that was so great and you know was raised in Pharaoh's home and great learning and and great understanding was so elevated in in Egypt everybody honored it you know his position he had he had he had the whole world at his fingertips he had had control of the whole world but you know what God brought him to that place for 40 years to beat it out of him now you you say why why did that take place why because it made Moses who he was it molded the character in Moses it molded him to the person that he needed to be when he was when he was a young man no doubt Charlton Heston muscular great looking guy come in there and I know the word the word says and I'm I'm the deliverer because you know what I've been taught this I have I have the theology it'll work but you know what it wasn't God's time but he had the theology right that's what the word says and all he ended up with a bunch of angry Jews a bunch of angry Israelites down there the children of Israel everybody's all upset wanting to fight each other and he had a dead Egyptian and all he done was just stirred to stirred them up but you know hey this is this is the plan of God this is the right time no it's not and then when he ran I spent 40 years on the back side of the Desert from being in great palaces and having the greatest things that are all in the world to following stinky animals around in the desert and having nothing but when he got to the place that he had nothing then you know what God could use him he went through all of that and all the struggle all the praying all the problems and when he got to the place and he realized you know he was still the deliverer he'd been the deliverer the whole time the word of God never changed in his life but he entered a new season in his life and when he got when he got on the backside of the desert and there was a burning bush experience for him when he came to that Bernie's Bush experience you don't hate him won't have anything to do with it well God you know what I'm I can't talk you know you know I that's not good I just no it's not me but all after all of that it brought him to the place that God wanted to use him and when he got to that place then God wanted to use him and he said listen I've got you you you go and I'll be with you and he give he gave him the signs and told him said you go and you showed these to pharaoh he said you can't talk that's all right you got a brother we'll send him his name's Aaron and if you've met any errands they know how to talk and talk and talk and talk so that wouldn't that wasn't a problem but when he went he went brother Ram said he went on a donk a little mule with a wife and a little kid and they asked him say where are you going he said I'm going to take over I'm going to take over Egypt the greatest army in the world the greatest civilization in the world a ball-headed prophet with a stick and he was going down our takeover he's like well you don't look like much well that's all right because I'm gonna be the biggest pain y'all ever had I'm gonna be the biggest heartache y'all ever had and he went down there and he didn't have to worry about you know what Pharaoh was going to do Pharaoh couldn't touch him he went right in there and he told told listen I come to see Pharaoh I got a word from the Lord from him and he went in he's like hey I got these two signs I got a I got a rod I can turn into a snake and make my hand leprous and you know when a lot of people when they would have went into that situation is like hey I got this stick and they dropped the rod all of a sudden it becomes a snake well you know what the Egyptian magicians could do the same thing but you know what it didn't Shake him right he didn't he wasn't nervous he wasn't concerned about any of that why because he knew what his commission was when those things came his way it didn't change him and so when he went in he and he began to speak and he said well listen I've got word that we're going out whether you like it or not we can do it the easy way or the hard way but God told Moses he said I have hardened Pharaoh's heart and they're not let he's not gonna let y'all go but that's okay we don't worry about that because we're going to show the people of Egypt who the real true God is because every one of their deities and all of the situations that they controlled the now God couldn't change the water back it became blood it wouldn't have changed it back to water couldn't stop the fleas of flies the frogs the hail the darkness hey when he come up there and told him it's coming then what he do Moses turned around went back to Goshen he had a place to go to and when it went all when all those things went through the death of the firstborn it led right up to the time it was time for them to go but it was amazing here's all these people in Egypt that well I got no confidence in this crazy man but after they see all these things even the children of Israel who were promised a deliverer that they were going to come out of the Strange Land they had a land to go to and here's this man comes on the scene and begins to show the Miracles that's taken place and yet they couldn't have faith to believe that they could get to where they were supposed to be going that when it was written that that's what we're going that's where we're going that's what we're going to do I've got a land flowing with milk and honey and it's where we're going we're going it's like but they couldn't get out of their own way to get to the land but see all these things come brother Rams says this is from the the message I know he says he said and why does God let troubles come he said God harnesses troubles puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God he said there had been no rainbow until the flood came but after Noah was pressed into the that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in a storm a little Arc pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over with that he saw the rainbow for its first time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of Promise after he had been through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the Promise after you've come through the tribulation like I've like that poem or Psalm must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease while the others fought to win the prize and sell through but he sees he said we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace our Comforts is just beyond the river see many times these things come our way and you know you you see the the condition to all these things that that happen there's many people in the scripture that you know they they come into these situations and you look at the um the the disciples after after hearing all of the scriptures all these years of knowing what God was going to do they hear all the all these things no doubt hearing the prophets all the Scrolls read so many times all the things that were going to take place that the the Messiah was coming you know the Peter and John them their dad was telling them about what was going to take place he said I may not see this son but listen I'm going to tell you something there's a day of coming because the scripture tells us and we're looking for the Messiah keep your eyes open look into the scripture look what the word says and there's coming a day this word's going to be fulfilled and what a great day it was when Jesus crossed their paths and began to speak to them tell them who they were what their conditions were and letting them know all of a sudden when they began to see who Jesus was they began to realize this is the Fulfillment of scripture we walked into a condition wow look at this it's so great and then all of a sudden here they are you're going to follow me and we're going to that you'll be Fishers of Men and he began to crawl these cause these young men to come with them these men to follow him and he begins to speak to him and tell him that what was going to take place and it was so amazing because their lives were so wrapped up all they could see was the fishes and the loaves uh Peter was the thing that that Peter could see was when Jesus cursed the Fig Tree and the Fig Tree died wow that's amazing look Lord the tree that you cursed it died it's dried up he's looking at these amazing things take place when they're sitting when he's sitting beside the well and he begins to speak to the woman and he asked her for water and he begins to speak to her and they're behind the trees in the bushes and they're watching Jesus have a have this conversation with a woman of ill repute when he begins to speak to her and begin to understand all of a sudden he begins to tell her who she was and her condition and he begins to speak to a man they're moved by that it stirs them up man look at this and then when he begins to explain to them the word and he gives them the commission to go and cast out and preach the word and cast out devils and then they come back and they're rejoicing to to Jesus tell Lord look what we can do we can cast out Devils we're able to preach the gospel and he said listen he said don't glory in that Glory that your names are written in heaven now not worry about these things and how many times did he come and tell him listen when they when they began to show him the temple and he's there at the temple and he's looking he said well tear this Temple down three days I'll raise it up again and how many times did he stand there and tell the disciples listen he said the son of man is going to fall in the hands of sinful men began to tell them what's going to take place but all they could see was the Miracles the water being turned into wine the dead being raised all the things that took place in their life all these great things that was taking place it was just so amazing but he began to speak to him and tell him there's coming a day I won't be with you always but he said I must go away that the comforter will come man and he said when the comforter comes he said he'll lead you and guide you into all truth the spirit will come and he said and you will be Witnesses and he begins to tell them all these things is going to take place and the scripture says Hey pointing them back to the Old Testament prophets the Old Testament prophecies and he's telling them before it happens he said listen he said all of y'all will deny me every one of you will deny that you ever knew me that you ever spent any time with me because why because I have to die alone I have to be rejected but it's promised in the scripture that is my that is my that's my lot that's that's the prophecy that I'm going to fulfill but he begins to tell them in all these problems and situations that he's coming he stands there and tell him he said let not your heart be troubled he said you believe in God believe also in me and he began to express to him listen there is a place laid up for you but you're going to go through hard times you're going to be uh rejected of all men you're going to be persecuted you're going to be hated for my name's sake he begins to speak to him the whole time and express to him what was going to take place in their lives but you know what he brought Peter aside and he told Peter he said listen he said Do You Love Me he said I want you to know something Peter he said Satan has desire to shift you like we but I've prayed for you and he said listen when it comes to the place you don't understand these things even when he was in the upper room and he began to speak to the disciples y'all don't understand these things but he said one of these days you will understand these things he said that's the reason I'm telling you now I want you to understand these things and when he began to express all these things to Peter and he tells Peter listen when you go through these things I've prayed for you feed my sheep feed my Lambs he's trying to Point Peter listen there's a job for you to do there's a commission for you to fulfill ment you may you may not understand it Peter but I want you to understand what a wonderful God that Jesus could stand there and speak to him and tell him all these things when they went through all of these things and you know maybe maybe it was a little bit of a shock to him even after Jesus had been preaching to him and explaining all these things but here they are going up into the Upper Room to have the Passover and he begins to speak to him and realizing I don't have much time left he said I want to share this with you and he wanted to show the sacredness of breaking bread and the wine and he wanted wanted to have this communion with him not just Bread and Wine but he wanted to show his heart to him and he began to speak to him he's meant to tell these things listen this is what's going to take place but you'll understand these things not long from now you know then he goes out into the garden and he begins to pray and you know and you know and all these things and here and in the midst of praying and you know when the when the Lord begins to to deal with him and and you know the spirit leaves him and all those things and he's there and all of a sudden here comes the Pharisees in Judas and and the rest of them come to get him then all of a sudden all of a sudden it's like a light switch flipped on and you know what that you know all of a sudden it got real he got real for them boys after they had heard after they had heard Jesus speak about all this stuff and all of a sudden here's Jesus like why are y'all coming at night with with all these weapons and everything he said didn't I preach in the synagogue every day didn't y'all see me all the time why are y'all acting like this now but you know all of a sudden everybody when all they come to get Jesus you know what it was a foot race to see who could get out of Dodge first when he just told him that was going to take place and then all the rest of them here they are sitting around holding their heads trying to think and you know they're trying to sneak around Peter them trying to sneak around trying to figure out where Jesus is and what's going on when in the midst of all that and Jesus told him said listen you're going to deny me Thrice before the crows and then in the midst of all that here here they are and they come to Peter and he was with that man he's one of his disciples I got no idea who you talking about you're out of your mind I got I got no recollection of this man well let me tell you something your speech gives you away by your speech we know your Galilee and We Know Who You Are I don't know I don't know him but went through all of that went went through before Pilate all the things that Jesus went through here they are standing back looking trying to see what's going on can you imagine being in the crowd your lord when you've ate with him you've slept with him you've seen him walk on the water he allowed you to walk on the water he give you the word to speak and you walked on the water and you're standing there and you're looking at your lovely Lord Jesus and they strip him and they beat him until he's almost dead today beat him till he's almost unrecognizable as a human and then they March him up up Calvary up to mount go gotha to nail him to a cross and you're standing there and looking at that and you wonder what in the world is going on and here he is hanging there and here he is hanging on the cross and he's struggling to breathe and he's and he's barely hanging on and all of a sudden then he begins to scream out and all of a sudden when he screams and nobody understands what he's talking about he's like is he calling for Elijah but Joe then he dies and then all of a sudden all our hope is gone we got no hope at all he just died he's our Messiah he's our King everything's gone brother Rome said even creation testified that he was dead and here they are out what are we going to do now not not listening to what Jesus had told him was going to take place but they just look in the situation and how hopeless it is and how and how they're they're I mean they have no they have no concept of what to do they've long I mean it's just you know their mind's spinning what are we going to do and here they are in the midst of all well I don't know I don't know and here they are standing there dumb from all the things that they've seen right where can we put our confidence where can we put our hope there's no place but Peter says he tells the other disciples he said I'm going fishing he said I'm going to go back to what I know I got to get away from the crowds and everybody out I got to get out on the water and some of the others what we're going with you and after all the things that they went through and all the things that they had suffered all these things here they are going through all this here we are uh trying to try to make sense of all this but when Jesus raises from the dead and he begins to speak to the women and he tells them he said you tell Peter and the disciples to meet me in Galilee when he begins to speak to him and tell him he didn't leave Peter out he know Peter was broken-hearted but he told him to say specifically you call Peter you let Peter know and when he began then when they began to all see all these things take place and you know you know this this great joy comes over hey the Lord's risen you remember when he told us that he was going to raise what he did he's alive we've seen him and you know what it was almost too good to be true they almost couldn't believe that it was going to take place after he told them and told him and told them but all of a sudden now they're trying to get their mind around the fact that he's risen he rose from the dead well because he's done what he said he would do and then he begins to make himself known to all of them and brother Branham tells us he said see before there can be a resurrection he said there's got to be a crucifixion and brothers sisters he said there's got to be a crucifixion in our life before there's a resurrection when he rose and he began to speak to him he said listen now after you've seen all these things take place he said now I'm telling you what the rest of it's going to be he began to encourage them listen I'm going to I'm going to ascend but the spirit's going to descend and he began to tell them what was going to take place he said Terry and Jerusalem there's a place for you to be you'd be there he said and stay there Terry don't go don't don't do anything you stay there until you're in dude with no power from on high so there was a time for them to be there for those things to take place and when all these things have taken place then when they begin to the place that they see the Lord just Ascend and they go and wait then you know what he wasn't he wasn't you know one day or two days or they're trying to figure out why have we got it yet have we got it yet he said you're going to know when you've been endued with this power when this takes place and they go through all all those days waiting until that rushing Mighty Wind comes and it touches them and it fills them and instead of being scaredy scaredy cats and and worried about things and you know so so confused and and so messed up about things and not understanding you know what's going to take place but when he came when the Holy Ghost came to them and it began to Quicken the word to them then they realized who they were they realized because they began to recognize what Jesus had told them that was the fact then all of a sudden then they become drunk men like drunk men walking out the door staggering out the door he's like well we got a bunch of drunk people up here and what was it Peter began to preach them and the 11 began to preach what was it this is they're not drunk like you're supposed but what do you but this is that that was prophesied by the prophet Joel this is the Fulfillment of the word and they began to preach to him and tell them who Jesus was and what Jesus came to do and they began to preach to them and it and the Holy Ghost was so real to them that they began to hear that message in their own language how how we hear every man in our own tongue we we're hearing these great things of God that's taken place well what what amazing thing and all of a sudden as as many of these people that believed we know what they heard they were baptized they believed and the Holy Ghost fell upon them and we see all these things have taken place but you know what it was it was the move of God and so you know many times we see things that happen in our lives and we wonder why things go the way they go we wonder why things happen the way they happen but you know what there's a time and a place for everything we don't understand things may look the worst that they've ever looked you may not understand anything that you're going through you may be on an ash Heap just like job and trying to figure out what's taking place and why things are going that way but you know what there was a man that come to job and began eliu began to speak to him and tell him the word and begin to imagine preach the word to him and show him and then the Lord came and spoke to job and began to speak to him brother Brian said he had a revelation of the Resurrection he saw those things and he said he said I know in the last days he said he said I'll see him with my own eyes he said I know my redeemer liveth when all the things that he had been through all the problems and all the confusion and all the disappointments that he had went through when God began to speak to job and he began to understand he began to reveal the word to him he said he had job had to had to receive a divine revelation and that's what it takes we have to have a divine revelation and when you receive that Revelation then God begins to express to you tell you the things that why things are the way they are you know we we want to do things the way we want to do it we want things to work out the way that we want them to work out but that's not God's plan many times you know we may suffer and and you know if we have loved ones that you know we want to see healed or or different things that happen in their lives and those things don't happen but you know all things work together for the good whatever whatever the situation is it may it may not be what we want it to be but you know what if God has it in control it'll work out for his honor and Glory and it'll brother said it'll be for our benefit it'll be for us many times we don't understand that but brother REM says you know one thing when these trials and tribulations and problems brother REM said they ask Heap don't last forever thank God the ash Heap doesn't last forever why because there's a Time Coming we may not understand all these things but we know that there's a time that it's all going to work out and we don't understand but God tells us just to be faithful just be faithful to what God has called you may not understand but just be faithful and all these things will work out in time Brethren said he said all made possible to us because there was one obedient in trial there was one who stood the test that was Jesus the one who was so obedient to the father to the father raised him up on Easter morning because it was not possible that he should be holding of death he said for I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell for he was found faithful always doing that which pleased the father he said may we ever be faithful at the post of Duty no matter what our trials is and our troubles whatever may we be able to say always I know that all things work together for the good to them that love God granted father amen well God bless you this evening let's all stand we'll have the musicians come thank you [Applause] amen okay I mean he can say My Redeemer Lives amen no matter what the circumstance or the trial the problems he lives He reigns it's

that's all these all these people it's like wow but you know what when the one of these days if you've not ever experienced it when you become a child of God and you realize that you've come from the foundation of the world he was he was a part of God he was in the mind of God you know all these great celebrities and all these people these famous people but I tell you what nothing trumps being a child of God realizing hey I'm I I'm the seed a jean seed of God has come man I tell you what you have like brother Louise says all the time brother Ram said ten thousand worlds if you had ten
