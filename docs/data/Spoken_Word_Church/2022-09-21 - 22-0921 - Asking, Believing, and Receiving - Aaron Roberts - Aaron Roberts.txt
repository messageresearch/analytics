then we'll go to james chapter 4. and going to talk on about prayer tonight and i entitled this asking believing and receiving amen that's what we're supposed to do and uh looking at some things and uh it's quite interesting when you get into things about asking and so we'll look at some of those things tonight so let's all bow our heads and we'll speak to the author before we get into the scripture this evening our heavenly father we just thank you lord for allowing us to come back in your house father lord together with those of like precious faith lord lord to fill your anointing lord to fill your presence wherever lord you said whether two or three are gathered in your name you're there in the midst of them and we just thank you lord for lord coming amongst us lord we invite

are how insignificant they may think they are lord lord you said but you had your eye on the sparrow if you had your eye on the spiral lord you had your eye on them lord because they're written in the palms of your hands or they're a part of you lord so you won't forget them lord matter where we go lord you're always there with us lord trying to bring us back trying to lead us and guide us in the correct way lord trying to correct us lord when we're wrong and lord just lord we just thank you for that lord that you're such a heavenly father to us lord him and lord every day you want us to see your presence lord that you want us to see your love that you have for us and father we just pray tonight lord you just help us as we look into your word bless each one we just commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen matthew chapter 21 and verse 22 says and all things whatsoever ye ask in prayer believing ye shall receive matthew 7 7-8 says ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened so now this is this is a looking james is speaking here in james chapter 4. it's a little bit a little bit different here but james says he says from whence come wars and fightings amongst you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members you lust and have not ye heal and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight more yet you have not because you ask not you ask and receive not because you ask amiss and ye may that you may consume it upon your lust ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enmity of god is the enemy of god do ye think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us loveth to envy but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you draw an eye to god and he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands he centers and purify your hearts you double-minded amen god bless you tonight you have your seats and this is uh this is from the message and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies the brotherhood says now imagine when a trial come up what's the first thing a child of god has for refuge when a trial comes he says the greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of mankind prayer it even changes everything it even changed the mind of god one time god told his prophets go up and tell the king he was going to die and the king turned his face to the wall and said lord i beseech you to consider me i have walked before you with a perfect heart i need 15 years longer and god spared his life 15 years longer prayer changes things that's right and he says no doubt when these three hebrew children come to a prayer meeting that night what are we going to do there had to be a gathering and decision to be made no doubt they prayed all night long and the decision was unanimously because they were going they were deciding that they could not afford to go back on god in the time of trial he said wouldn't that be good for the whole church now when the decision is made shall i turn to the things of the world shall i go like the rest of them go that decision comes to every christian it comes to you daily how are you going to do it you've got to make your decision amen so i want to look here asking and believing and receiving and one of the first things i want to look at is the word ask and here's some definitions for the word ask it says to put a question to to inquire of and that's usually what we think of when when we talk about asking is we always talk about it being in the form of a question to inquire but it says to say something in order to obtain an answer or more information or request something to do or give something so here when we when we talk about see say something and one of the things i was when i was looking at some of these things what come to my mind is you know we have they have a uh program now in the united states and it says if you see something say something if you see something out of place or whatever you see something suspicious you're supposed to say something and i i was looking at some things and that's what caught my attention was you know if you see something then you ought to say something also if you see something in the word of god then you ought to say something because it should elicit a response from you because if if something catches your attention because you know then you have to say what what it is to you because you should amen that it should it shouldn't have you know nobody has should have to pull an amen out of you or glory to god or hallelujah or something that caused you to raise your hands it should always be something inside of you that's just bubbling up that somebody just say something and you say that's nothing but the truth it requires a response boy because there's something down on the inside because if it's if it's a fountain that's bubbling up then it's got to have a release somewhere it's going to come out somewhere and you know i was thinking about what brother brother wade's talking about now is the time that he talks about you know now is the time and the day in which we live it's time to let it out whatever is on the inside it needs to come out it needs to it needs to be exposed it needs to be manifest because if it's on the inside then it's time to let it out now many times you know what we talk about the word ask and we always talk about you know when we're little and we're teaching little kids you know to ask nicely you know and maybe make sure you use the right words you know don't say can you say may i do something because you don't say can because that's that's wrong because that's asking if somebody has the ability to do something but you're asking for permission but you know one of the things that that when we look here in the scripture you know when when you're asking of something of god you know god doesn't always want us to question or ask it in the form of a question you know because it's not asking but to understand who you are and what what is yours then when you go to claim or you have a need then it's not something where we have to sit and even though brother branham said you know god doesn't have to beg us but he said if there's any begging needs to be done we need to do it but it doesn't necessarily mean that we have to beg god to get something from it now here in the message the restoration of the broad tree brother branham says he said now if satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or daughter of god we have a right this morning by the holy ghost to enforce the claim of god bring them back if he's afflicted you and made you sick we have a right before god to enforce the laws of god by stripes we are healed amen bring it back turn him loose you're taking him out here under death and we claim him bring him back now that's the enforcement restore it back to its natural condition again a man is sick a baby is sick a woman is 6c they're not out they're out of their natural condition then we have a right to enforce our claim not our claim it's our claim because god gave it to us by stripes we were healed he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed now we have a right to enforce that law and the lawgiver the holy spirit himself is here the agent of god to see that it's done that way amen now when when uh one of the things i was looking at when when here brother branham and he's speaking of this and he's speaking of having an enforcement and having a claim now when you go to a court of law and you make a claim and you file a lawsuit and you go before the court to make a claim you know you don't have to go before the court and and you don't have to ask can i do something because when you go before the court when you go into court the thing that you have to do is when you file your legal documents or whatever the first thing you have to do is you have to apply the law so you have to know what the law says and then when you walk in there then because if you say well this is my property and this is my deed to this property this belongs to me i have the sales receiver and all the different prop the paperwork for this shows that it's mine now when i walk into court and say no this is the law this is the right court for this is the judge that i'm supposed to be standing before here's my documents this shows that this belongs to me now what i want to do under the law certain law certain subsection whatever it says that i can do this this person right here that is on my property or has taken my property his brother bannon breeds here and i'm going to kick him out or i want my property back now this is the law and this is what it says now i don't have to go in there and ask the judge for that all i have to do is bring it before the judge and telling this is what the law says this is who i am so i'm in good standing in the proper standing to make this claim and this is my this is my documents and then all i have to do is apply all the other evidence and facts that are needed for the case and i present that before the judge and then then the case has to present go forward and where the judge can have to hear the from the other side and make his judgment i don't have to go in there and ask questions you know question and plead well all i got to do is go in and make my po so when the word says that i make my petitions known before god it's not that i have to go in there and plead and beg all i have to do is walk in and tell him i'm a son of god and this is my claims and i'm gonna exercise my rights and here i stand so when i come boldly before the throne of grace to make known my petitions i don't have to stand there and wonder if god's going to hear me or not i don't have to plead and beg all i got to do is stand up and claim my god-given rights as brother brown said claim your god-given rights so when i stand up there now all i have to do when i walk into a court is make my petitions known and show who i am and what i want amen so here i will read the i just want to read a few scriptures here this is matthew chapter six beginning at verse eight it's number three he says he says be not therefore like unto them when he's speaking of the pharisees and such he said for your father knoweth what things you had need of before you asked them he said after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our sin our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not in temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever amen now i read that for one thing is he this this is why jesus told the disciples he said under this matter this way you should pray and you know because he was talking about you know the the pharisees and such you know the scribes and all that you know they they want to make these long prayers and he thought well you know the longer they make their prayers and and these great flowing words and everything like and they think they're going to be heard because of what they say and god knows what you have need of before you say anything it doesn't no no that makes it makes you god want to listen to you but it's it's a it's a broken and a contrite heart it's somebody that's open and and bear before god and honest before god is who he's going to listen to so that's the way you present your case but one of the things i i want to read some of these because you know one of the things i read that you know there's never a question in any of that he didn't question any of that oh please god can you do this for me may i have this no jesus said give us this day our daily bread amen so when you go into just like when you went into a court of law you're not asking you're making your petition known so how do you do that you know what your position is and you know what you want and you make that known amen amen here's here's jesus also praying matthew in matthew 26 when he's in the garden and he's and he's praying before he goes to calvary and he says and and he says and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt and then in verse 42 says and he went it went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thou will be done so when he's speaking then he's not he's not questioning it but he's just making his petition known and then mark 11 23 and 24 says for verily i say unto you that what whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what so what things soever ye desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them so we don't so right back we're not we're not asking for something we're making our petition known so we're claiming what's ours and speaking to god amen now one of the things that that i wanted to say was you know i love that story that brother dale's told so many times about that man said you know he said i don't ask the god for anything anymore he said i'm working on commanding the lord because the bible says command ye me and pop said he just turned around and walked off because he knew he was talking to i mean what kind what kind of ridiculous thing but you know it's not because you you don't go in arrogant and you're not gonna you're not gonna force god into something but you know what god wants you to bring his word to him when you bring israel because what does he want to hear when you when you when he says confess when he says confess what what brother rhymes say he said it's to say the same thing so when you're confessing you're saying the same thing it's not that well lord can i have this no you said that i could have these things you know uh when i was when i was preaching to the brothers in india i use my i use my favorite quote and and you know i've read it many times and y'all may y'all may know it but i love it just it just first time i read it just thrilled my soul and you know brother in the message why he talks about that little sister that had that was poverty-stricken you know she just had all those those little pretty pictures that her son had sent her and she was about ready to starve to death and had nothing but somebody come by and was checking on her and asked her about you know you had a son yeah and you know he's got money and and all this type thing and it's like well you know it seemed like he'd be want to take care of his mother so well he probably don't know what kind of kind of condition i i'm in but you know went through all of those things and they said but i get all these pretty pictures from him and you know the man was in india and and he had all these pretty pictures that he had sent his mom and she just stuffed them in her bible and she was just laying there holding on to all those things and and then somebody come by and and they took those things and and said well let's see those pretty pictures so she went and got her bible and she opened up her bible and she began to look at and pull those pretty pictures out and somebody began to look at them and realize you know what they just want pretty pictures but they were bank drafts that had come from india that had been converted from indian money into american money and brother brown said what was it he said in the lids of her bible she had everything he she thought it was just pretty pictures but come to find out it had real value to her and brother brown says and brother when somebody tries to take you of a painted fire of pentecost that jesus is not the same as he was back then he said don't believe that he said because the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that's a far off even as many as the lord our god shall call he said he said that's a bank draft on heaven so when the money is already there he said all you got to do is make that claim is write that check on the bank draft of heaven and see if he won't fulfill it so when you're making the claim it's not that we're asking god that we have to ask god for something no god wants you he said ask that your joy might be full so when we're asking we're not asking if we can have something while we're just going to claim what's ours why because he's already given to if he's standing here today brother ram said if he was standing here tonight in clothes standing in front of us he couldn't do more for you than he's already done he said lord jesus could you heal me no i've already healed you the problem is is you've got to make the claim and you've got to walk into the claim and make that make that claim and stand and hold on to it so it's your claim have you made that petition known before god not wondering if god's going to do it no you make it known and put it in god's in god's life put it in god's hands and you know what then he'll take care of it but the problem is is we wonder if you know it's like as brother brown was talking about somebody stole their property and you know and the lawman comes to take him to jail and you're holding on to well i don't know if i should let him go no yes man you know i don't know he said you know what you're not ever going to get anywhere doing that he said you've got to turn him over to god and the devil take your property or take whatever from you then you let the you let the holy spirit take him and take him and pull him away and let him handle the situation then you can get what you have need of but if you've got your hands and you want to meddle in it and try to hold on to it and you're just being a being a hindrance to yourself but you've got to let god have it and handle it turn it over to him so then he can do what needs to be done see all these things are placed in the scripture for us james chapter james chapter 1. verse 5 and 6 says if any any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and not upright of not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing weight nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed so you can't you've got to turn it over to god and hold on by faith nothing wavering why because if he said it then you know what i'm just going to turn over to you lord because that's what you said and i'm just going to let you handle it because that's all i can do i can't let i can't do anything else you're the one that's in charge and you're the one that's made to make the petition known so i'm just going to let you handle it first john 5 verse 14 and 15 says and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him so if we ask in confidence because we know where we're standing and if we know what the will of god is because we know that the will of god is his word so if we know what the word says then if we just take the word right here and we begin to read in the scripture and we realize that the word is this is ours and then whatever he says in the word belongs to us and there's no there's no qualms there's there's no wavering god don't waver on what he said god's not an indian giver he's not confused on what he said now sometimes we get confused on what he said but you know he's never been confused on it and the thing is is if he's ever done it brother i said if he's ever done it one time for any one person that if you make the same conditions that person meant then he's got to do the same thing why because he's he's honor bound by his word to fulfill it and you know what he wants that's his desire is for us to take him at his word and hold on and believe what he's saying and if he can just get people to actually believe what he said and walk in it and believe what he said that's all that was that's the greatest thing if that god wants us to have somebody that will actually take him and believe what he said now this is from the message and i read all that and you know there's no there's no questions no questions but just saying what you want now to believe and confess what the word says and this this is from the message look away to jesus and brother branham's and brother branham is at sister hattie wright's house and he and he's speaking and he says look look i said it is only the only thing is he is jehovah jireh just when abraham needed a realm god provided that rim and he provided the squirrels he can speak a squirrel just into existence because he is a creator creator just the same as he could speak the realm abraham never asked for it he was just simply going on to do it but he showed that jehovah jireh was there so he didn't ask for it why because he was fulfilling what god told abraham to do he god told abraham he said take your son and go offer him on the mountain but you know what abraham didn't waver he didn't get confused he didn't he didn't have any problems with what he said he took him and when he when the servants were there he said me and the lad are going yondered to worship but we'll come back because he had a confession he had had faith to what god was going to do he didn't know how god was going to work it out but he knew what god would do because he was the promised son because brother madam said in the message patriarch abraham he said he got god gave abraham a double test he made him wait 25 years and go through all of the journey that he had to to come to the place where he could actually receive a son and then the son was born and then he turned right around and told him to offer him as a sacrifice you know many times people people have to you know they get so troubled sometimes because they go through things and you know they they struggle with things and they have to go through a hard time and and it struggled and all this and just on and on and on and it seems like they got victory and as soon as they get through the victory then they got another battle and it's worse than the first one or they're more confused why why god why are we going through this i mean we just come out of this and now we're going through the same thing and not realizing if you're if you're the faith seed of abraham you know what then you go through one trial guess what god's made you and he showed you you can come through that one so when you enter into the next one then you don't have to complain why because if he brought you through the first one then he's giving you the grace to come through the second one instead of saying thank god i've got the victory then i'm just going to continue to walk in it instead of complaining and trying to look and have the wowzy wowzy woos and the molly grubs and everything else but to realize you've got victory he's already given you the victory see he brought us through see if he was he was jehovah jireh that he that he brought us through he said i said that a humble little woman the first time this ever happened the third pull being upon a human a human being was a little humble woman and he was talking about you know she only made like two hundred dollars a year another just strolling up bro but you know he talks about all this and you know he wanted to give her money back and he says and little had he said the right word said that's nothing but the truth and there she she said that brother banks wouldn't hear is one that was present that room filled like it was coming apart and the holy spirit said the same voice that spoke about those squirrels said give her what she asked for and i said sister hattie as a witness before god this is it now if there is any doubt in your mind you ask what you want to and if it ain't laid on in your lap then i'm a false prophet she said brother branham everyone was crying said what shall i ask for and then she began to talk about well you know you're poor and all these things like that but scrolling up says but whatever you asked for sister had he see now if it happens or not right now see if it happens or not right now and i said he just told me the same voice said give her what she asked for and she looked around and said what shall i say brother branham i said say didn't i didn't say i said say what you desire what your desire is think of your greatest desire and say it and her voice was even snickering and laughing and she said the greatest desire that i have is the salvation of my two sons i said i give them to you in the name of jesus christ and there they went and they have been faithful in this church with communion them little boys sitting there watching feet with the men and things like that and we are witness to that she had a real choice her mother has to die so does she all of them but what she asks will be eternal and the salvation of her children that is the third time it happened so when she began to say when they asked her what was what was the you know what shall i say brother branham what shall i ask for he didn't say that she had to ask he said say what you want make your petition don't say because you're standing there because you said the right word and you know what struck me was i was sitting on i was sitting on the roof and i was thinking about you know but what sister hattie wright said put her in the right condition and it left her in a position for her to say whatever she wanted to and i was sitting on the roof and i and i and i thought that and i and i repeated it back to myself and it's like man we play that left right game there's a there's a red light right left thing because you know what because sister hattie wright said the right thing and it left her standing in the position to say the right word because she had the right thing to say that confused some of you but you know what i had to laugh on when i said it on the roof and i said you know what i'm going to have to say that in church because that i just love that but you know what it puts you in the right condition by saying the right thing it leaves you in the right place to say what you have need of and many times people's like well you know it's just like being trying to get say well you know i'll come to church or i'll come to god when i get good enough you know what you're never going to get good enough to come to god all you got to do is follow the word and come to god and he takes care of the rest and lots of times people think about all the things all the sins that we've committed all these things you've got to get beyond all that and put that under the blood because he's faithful and just to forgive you and cleanse you from all unrighteousness then make your petitions known but if you let the devil play in your mind then you'll wonder about all these things that you've done you can't stand there and hold the promises of god and worry let the devil play in your mind you can't have let the devil have any place in any of this you've got to stand there and say devil you're done you're finished get behind me because i because i claim the blood i have stood i'm righteous before god that i have the right to stand boldly before the throne of grace and make my petitions known i can claim what he said why because he gave it to me the desire that god has is for us to claim what belongs to us but many times people want to hold on to the wrong things we want to people people have their desires so messed up that they get they get so bound down by things that are false and and wrong that's the reason i was i was reading here in james where it talks about you know all these fightings and wars and things when when here's james speaking to the to the believers you know when you get all wrapped up and things why because there's things in this world that people people want you know because we're human we like nice things we like comfort i mean and it's not wrong to have those things but the problem is that sometimes people desire to have have the things of the world then they have more have more desire the things of the world than they do of the things of god and he says he said ye ask and you receive not he said he said ye he said you lust and you have not you killed and you desire to have and you cannot obtain you fight in war yet you have have not because you ask not why because people people are out they get up early in the morning and they're struggling and striving trying to get something but you know what they never ask god for anything they get out people do things and they the last person they ask is god they never bring anything before god to find out what needs to be done what god's will is or anything like that they're spinning their wheels and they wonder why things never get to the place where they want them to get to why things don't ever change why things don't get any better and it's like why because you've not asked and he said he said you asked and received not he said because you ask amiss that you may consume it upon your own lust so when you're asking for something brother if you look up the word i miss it means something that's improper so you're asking for something that's improper that you may feel your own desires and not the desires of god what would what would you have me to do what is that your desire for me to do no it's i'm chasing my own dreams i'm chasing my own things and you know many times we have a lot of young people and they they start to wonder about what they're going to do in the future and all these things like that and it's like well just seek the lord just seek the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you but you've got to seek god first if you put god first in everything that you do you never go wrong but the problem is we get we get messed up on things because we get out of step now one of the one of the the definitions of of the word of mist is when you start to look at the word of mist and when you it means improper it means wrong one of the one of the words for that is sick when jesus speaking to the pharisees and and they're asking why are you eating with the sinners and the publicans he says a physician is not needed by the well people it's by the ones that are sick it's the same word a miss is the same word it means sick it also means diseased it also mean anything anything that's out of place out of out of order so you know when you think about all these things when you're asking for something and then when you when you start to get something and things don't go the correct way then you wonder why because you've asked the wrong way because you're following the wrong way now when when brother branham was speaking here in the message the inner veil he was speaking of of the children of israel and he says notice this how god sets in the church this is number 10 brothers he said now notice is how god sits in the church and what he does you're eating the same manna now he said now here was one wall of justification one man can come to christ and no man can come to christ unless the holy spirit calls him and the holy spirit is god and you know it no man can it's the same holy ghost and these people out here in the in the justified state a fellow trying to serve god out here in the courts was eating the same kind of manna they were that was on the inside of the holiest of holies but the thing it was it ran out it got contaminated he said they were all saying there's wiggle tails in it and the problem is what is what he say he said you must go out every morning when the when the manna fell he said they had to go out and pick up their portion every morning but they couldn't hold any of that over except on the on the the sixth day for the seventh day because they had to hold get that double portion because they wouldn't fall on the on the sabbath they had to get that double portion but anytime anybody tried to hold over any of that manna that failed they go well i don't have to go out and do this tomorrow because i'm gonna hold this over well the next thing you know they had a big disease rotten mess on their hands because it was full of wiggle tails and then and when the children of israel done that then moses got mad at him and told him so why did you do these things knowing this contrary to the word it's contrary to what god told you he said he got contaminated says all they all say it had wiggle tails and he said that's what's the matter with a lot of people's experience tonight it's got wiggle tails in it rotten maggots it's because you permitted it there you are living out here eating the same manna now the man could eat here he was he was eat all right but he got he got hungry real quick that's the way with the people saying i can i just can't hardly hold yeah you're not far enough right you'll come to that holy place watch aaron the high priest when once a year anointed went in behind the curtains and when the with them curtains dropped behind him the world was shut off so what is it because the the same brother said the matter was a type of the holy ghost it's the same holy ghost all the way through that's leading you brethren said also types the message so it's the same word that's coming all the way through that's leading you in the beginning it's the same word that you're feeding on the problem is is people don't follow the same way because you've got to continue until you get into the holy of holies but so when you when you're in the outer court or in the inner court that's good but you got to continue on till you enter into the holies of holies because the problem is is all of that on the outside yeah it run out there was they had to continue to go back but he said the thing is when you went behind the holy of holies that group that owner of of mana that was collected was put back there in that area behind where the holy of holies when it said back there you know what it never got old it never got stale and every time each priest when they had the opportunity to go back there when they came into the priesthood then they were offered the opportunity to come into that same place and taste that same manna that nobody else knew anything about but they could come into there and they could eat of that same manner that fell in the wilderness that was showing that god that god kept his promise you know it's you know they call it the the the ark of the testimony well why was it called the ark of the testimony because it was a testimony of god to the people showing that he was true to them he fulfilled his promise but they never kept their end of the bargain they never kept their word to him because each one of the times that you see why was it because when they when they went up there when moses went into the mountain and he went on the end of the mountain and god gave him that was giving him the ten commandments and god was communing with him for the 40 days what were the what were the children of israel doing they were down there committing idolatry and what was it when moses came down he break up the stones on the golden calf destroying that why because it was a testimony to them because god had went in there to bring the law down to them and they're out there committing adultery committing idolatry spiritual fornication because they were out there just i just well you know what aaron we want you to raise up another god to us because this moses ain't coming back we ain't seen him in forever but that's not what god said god was still god and god kept his word to him and then he told moses later on after he rebuked the people and he ground up the gold and he made him drink the water and then he went back up into the mountain and god told him said come back up here and i'll give you the law the tablets that you broke and he brought them back down to the people and he showed them the tablets said this is a rebuke to you because you know what if you hadn't been in idolatry if you hadn't got away from god and his word then you know what we wouldn't had this problem because we would have had the original ones so here they come bringing the second ones in because it was a rebuke to them because they didn't follow the word and then they went here they are murmuring and complaining against moses and aaron because he didn't like they didn't like the way that god chose them well i don't think god really chose you i don't think you're really called of god then what did he do he took one he took each one of the tribes and wrote their name on they told him you take a man you take a stick you write their name on each stick and you put it in in the holy play in the holy of holies and see which one god vindicated why because it butted and brought forth the almonds why because it was a proof to the people who god had chosen you know what that wasn't something that moses done that wasn't something that aaron did that was something that god done for them and here they are when they go out and god brings them out into the wilderness and leading them and and told them we're going to the land of milk and honey and every time they had a need when they were short of water he always gave them water but he told them all the way in this journey you're going to have food that you're going to eat that's going to give you the strength and then you're going to be well and you won't have any problems all the way through this journey and all they were walking and going and every time they had a need every time they had a battle whatever would come their way god was there to answer the need and meet their need and all they could do was murmur and complain about what god had done and they stood there and said we blow this light bread moses we're so tired of this get us something else go to god we want something else because we're tired of what comes from heaven so what'd he do he took a whole homer of that and put in there as a testament but because each one of those things spoke against the children of israel why because god does exactly what he was going to do and what he would do for them and they rebuked and done away with it murmured and complained against what god had done for him amen you know what no wonder that god didn't told him don't come up on this mountain you know he wanted he wanted to have fellowship with him he wanted he wanted to speak to each one of them but they didn't want it that's right and many times god wants to speak to different ones and he wants to speak to us and many times you know we don't want to listen and people don't want to listen to what god has to say why because sometimes it doesn't come through the right person and you know and they don't like the person that's saying it and you know they don't like the way the person says it and and you know they don't like they don't like their english or or whatever else that you know they don't like the color of their necktie whatever else the problem is you know they always have some kind of issue with it that they don't like and you know it's like you know that when you when you want to if you have if you need to find a excuse why the lord's all or the devil's always there to give you an excuse or whatever you want no matter how flimsy it is and but but you know they you know the lord wants to try to help people and and speak to people's hearts but you know it's what your desire is whatever you what your desire if you want to hear from god or not when we speak here when we look at so when we have this he said you have you asked not you ask and you receive not because you ask amiss so when we speak of this word i miss and we look at these things that that are that are improper and all these things and you know you think about all you know you all of this what am i you know just trying to put this in words but you know you think of something that's that is so sickening and something that's diseased or something that's rotten you think you think of all these things and people would rather hold on to that than what god has for them you know and here is a from the message uh the seed is not heir with the shuck brother i'm speaking and he says um he said it reminds me as i was coming from phoenix the other day coming to tucson from the meeting the spirit lord called my attention to something as my wife and i were going along talking and the children were asleep in the back of the car getting late called my attention to a hulk and i watched that hulk a little bit and studied him he's a very type of the church today now the hulk as we all know has lost his identification of his original creation that's exactly right once he was similar to an eagle is his greater brother a hawk was but now he doesn't fly in the skies no more to hunt his heavenly mana but he's he's gotten soft he don't fly in the skies anymore he hops on the ground like a vulture sits upon a telephone post hops along hunting for dead rabbits the hulk wasn't made to do that no he was made to be similar like an eagle now just like like the church it was made similar to the eagle it should take the place in the heavenlies but instead of that he it's got soft it don't fly into the unknown anymore into the blue no sir it's depending on its modern ways of adoption of education and theology and some man-made denomination looking for a bunch of dead rabbits half rotten that something else had that's right hopping along on the ground now you see that's right a hulk see that's what tails the eagle hasn't changed a bit it stays an eagle and brother brahma says in the in the message the queen of the south he said where the carcass is the eagles will be gathered together he said i'm talking about eagles now not buzzards i'm talking about eagles that like eagle food out of the word of god not out of some creed book or almanac but out of the word of god that teaches that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he never fails he just remains the same living god amen amen and he continues only speaking to the queen the queen of sheba she was going on and you know she was hungry because she wanted to she wanted she had a desire to see those things that she had heard about the things that that solomon you know of all the people had been passing through the land and they were telling her about the wisdom of solomon all those things that she had seen that they had seen and heard and they began to tell and it began to create a hunger inside of her it had a desire inside of her to go see those things and you know what when she made up her mind to go and see the things of solomon then you know what it didn't it didn't matter what anybody else said whether whether the religious people wanted her to go or whoever else didn't want her to go it didn't matter she's like i'm going to go see this for myself because it has stirred something inside of me that i have a desire to go see that and it didn't matter that she took up all of her all her jewelry and fine things with her and to set off with her servants and she was going to go see those things and brother i'm talking about those 90 days through the desert and all the the perils that she had to go through and all the the dangers that she went through but you know what it didn't matter to her because there was something that was driving her forward that she was coming to that place and when she got there and began to speak to solomon and see those things and she was like all the things that i have heard and that and all the things that they've told me about all this she said the half wasn't even told well how great it was and when she began to see all of not just to hear the wisdom of solomon but to see all the things that were built and all of the servants and everything that was there she was just amazed how all of that was put together and how it was so wonderful she said the half hasn't ever been told how great it was and you know because if you only see how good it is you know because many people people you know they don't see how great god is and how what god has in store for you and they they just get so far but they don't go any further and not realizing how much greater things are in store for you just to hate it amen amen now this is from the message the world falling apart and brother ram says now watch god he gave us a program the father's word and the true believer holds on to it because he can't help it it's the kingdom of god in him and like abraham he calls everything contrary to god's word as though it wasn't and if anybody tells you that denomination is of god you stay what like abraham if anybody tells you you must be sprinkled or some kind of little something system or something contrary to god's word don't you believe it you can count you count it as though it wasn't and you know about women cutting their hair and wearing slacks and all these different things and he said in that system that tells you that it's all right to do that don't you believe it it's false anointed it's a false christ it's against god's word the righteous hold on to the word of god because it's the program of god's eternal word he said when god made a man he made him one way made a woman he made him a nut made him another way made her another way there's two different covenants two different plans two different all together between them and they don't look alike they're not they're not look alike they're not to act alike they're different all together right and he said a woman they're trying to be like men and a man so cystified he's like a woman and i thought that was good i seen a woman the other day seen a boy yesterday in cincinnati it looked like mrs kennedy the kennedy that hair the way it was like that god wants a man to look like a man wants a woman to look like a woman said i tell you this jezebel system of the devil's got the whole world in corruption not a sound place sin it's all purified source source of cancer malignancy of the devil that's eating the very core out of the systems that they've got set up here satan is a vulture feeding this is so satan is a vulture feeding upon his own kingdom he's a devil he's in he's an impure he is the father of lie he feeds upon the flesh of his own people the devil now i i was thinking about i was listening to somebody the other day and they were talking about abraham and man i tell you what he was this man was talking about abraham and the seed of abraham and man i tell you what he was he was a little snippet of a sermon and man i tell you what he was laying it all down about abraham the seed of abraham and being christ and being christ like all the things that abraham went through and we're just like that man he was laying it down just all right down the line see to abraham man we're overcomers all the things man he was laying it down just perfect and then i seen another clip from him the other day and he was out there and he was laying it down and he was talking about paying tithes and he said well you know in the new testament there's no place that tells you we're supposed to pay attention and he was leading he was going through all these scriptures and everything like that but the only scripture that's in the bible that talks about that was you're supposed to give cheerfully unto god that's the only scripture that he was talking about he went through all that and i thought man did you learn did you ever remember your sermon where you preached on on the seat of abraham and you remember about seed of abraham and you just kept laying down the seed of abraham seed abraham going on down that line i said do you remember that seed abraham when he met melchizedek he gave a 10th of all he's like man that's really good you won't talk about being the seed of abraham until the time it comes time to pay in tithes and then we forget that we're belonging to the seat of abraham he was just amazing but you know i just thought you know that's the way people are they they just want to pick and choose what kind of part of the you know what i i want all the blessings i want all this but don't let me have any hardships don't let me go through all of this and don't ask me about my money yeah don't touch my any of my money i don't want to have anything to do with that but you know what it's it's if you're going to belong to the seat of abraham that it's in the good times and the bad times the hard times and the difficult times amen but you know what if you're if you're a cheerful giver why would it why would it matter if you gave 10 or not i just thought that was kind of interesting how people you just hear people talk about things that just kind of stood out to me when i heard that says here christ is the king of kings and lord of lord the anointed messiah the believer holds to that word god and his word is one i and my word are one you and your word are warned they don't lean then don't lean use your own thoughts use his thought then you're a part of of god because his word and you become the same see then you're in the kingdom abraham called anything that was contrary to god's promise as though it wasn't see like man made things today we don't hold any of those things but you know if if you look at where he was talking about you know holding on to the things of of the devil and the things that the devil says and he says you know here they are putrified sores cancer malignancies and all those things and it's like well you know i don't i don't know if i want to give these things up well sometimes when you begin to see what what it actually is then you know what i don't want to hold on to anything the devil has i don't you know whatever whatever the devil tries to put on me i don't want to have it now he's gonna paint you you know he wants to paint a beautiful picture of all this he wants everything to look so beautiful and and everything like that and it's like but when you begin to see what it actually really is then you know what then you realize you know what it's not the way it looks you know i i was thinking about a story that we read in school years ago and and it was this uh it was this man who married this this new new wife and he was bringing her back to town on the train and and they come in and everybody saw her from a distance and was talking about oh how beautiful she was and and all her fineries and all these great things that she came with on the train and and everything like that and this man had lots of money and and all this was coming in and as they were all cheering as she come into town and they were all excited to see this woman but you know as they begin to get closer to her and they begin to see spend more time with her and and all these different things then they begin to see you know what she had a lot of flaws in her and there was a lot of things that just you know just wasn't as as beautiful as everybody thought they were and and all this as time went on then people began to realize you know what this ain't all it's cracked up to be and they were and it was telling all this and and so you know lots of times when you read stories in school it's like okay i read the story now you tell me what the story's supposed to mean because i don't know you tell me what it's supposed to mean it's like because if you don't know what the author's trying to tell you sometimes when you read these stories it's like i know what it i know what it says but what's the underlying what's the parable here you know what's the underlying meaning but the story the the meaning of the story was this man had great wealth and he was bringing this new woman in and she was bringing all these fineries in and what it was talking about was the change from the old agricultural way of america coming into a technological and mechanical uh industrial way of of living and and everybody began to look at all these great things and they thought man this is so beautiful because we're going to have you know all these great fineries and wonderful things all these great inventions are going to come in you know we're going to have washing machines and all these other things you know we're gonna have cars and and all these things everybody thinks hey this is so great they're gonna start recording music and and all these great things we think man this is so great and then all of a sudden later on people start getting into those things and realizing you know what it's not as great as you think it is so as we've you know as i was saying about where uh brother branham was talking about john and uh charles wesley's mother you know having 17 children and being able to pray with each one of them and all those things he said you know we we had all these all these things when we had to work on the farm and we'd done all these things and now we you know we're supposed to have more time and we've got less time for god and it's like you know we're supposed it's supposed to alleviate the burdens of our lives and all it does it takes up more of our time and we've we've lost we've lost the the time we think we're saving time and we're not saving any time because we're not any closer to god than we was before and it's like no so when you're reading these stories and it looks so beautiful and and it looks so great but when you start getting closer to it and you start to really dig into it it's like it's not as pretty as it looks it's and so many times you know the devil wants to paint you a pretty picture of something and he wants it to look so rosy and everything but when you start to get into it realizing it's not what you think it is it's not as great as you think it is it's not as beautiful but you know what you can't you can't say the same thing about god's word i tell you what the more you get into god's word the more it opens up the more beautiful it is the more fulfilling it is the more great it is and then when you get to a place where you can't you can't put enough words to describe how great it is this is from the this is from the anointed ones at the end time brother brown says he said he said no notice moses never give give them what was moses time he said we'll build an ark because that's that's the word you know noah built an ark one day no vultures was eating on that no no this is this is a promised word notice for his message he had from god he had the genuine predestinated word of god for his hour neither did jesus serve them moses leftovers moses had the word for that hour but moses was a prophet here is god himself see he never served them moses leftovers but just look at the vultures there in that organization was gutting over it he said we know we got moses we don't have time we don't have to have you he said he said if you'd have known moses you'd have you would know me because moses spoke of me see oh my i said where the carcass is the eagles will gather eagles the fresh kill of the word the word that's raised up and fattened that's been made manifest and give out to the food from for the children now the old carcass that's laid there for hundreds of years that that'll be there it'll be same now luther had a message of repentance but you bunch of lutheran buzzards message baptist had a message but you baptist buzzard see the pentecost had a message coming home now the pentecostal buzzer but where the carcass is he said there the eagles will gather so all of the time that you go through all of the the ages and all the things that that's taken place all the way down through the to the yes it was truth god had truth but you know what it only takes the truth of this day not any truth we build on what was said in the past but you know what you can't hold on to what was back there you have to continue on and you know because any of those things that you let down on any one spot and if you don't go further from where you are today then you know what then it all begins to get wiggle tails and it all becomes rotted it all becomes putrified source because you know it's wonderful to talk about what god done yesterday or done last year or 20 years ago or whatever like that but you know if if it's not greater today than it was back then then then we need to have a reconversion we need to get back in the altar of god because we need to get back to the place where it's greater today than it was yesterday i don't want to live on on the things that that have taken place in the past i'm i'm going up higher and higher and higher i want to continue on i want to because why because if there's a if there's a new fresh manner there's a new fresh keel of the word in the opening of the word today then that's what i want to be in i want to feed on that i don't want to feed on on the other things brother bram said when you when you recognize that the very word of god was eagle so he said you left the other thing he said it's time to leave all that other he said he said when you he said when you formed into the living image of the living god he said you've heard from your theology so when you when you've heard from one because you realize what the word is that you're hearing from it's what you are yeah i i tell you what you know it's hard it's hard to sit still sometimes when you realize you know i came from god and that's who i'm hearing i'm hearing from the one that created me i'm this is this is who i am why because we are one it's not that i'm that god is one and i'm somebody else no i'm a part of him when you realize who you are that you're a part of him when you're a part of the word amen when you're a part of the word made manifest then when you realize who you are then you know what i can believe what the word says why because it's a part of me i'm not believing somebody else's word i'm believing the word for me why because if i receive the word as the word has gone forth and after i've received the word then i've become the word then you know what then how can i deny the word just like jesus couldn't deny the word and god couldn't deny his own word because you know what i am that word amen well people as brother ronnie was speaking of you know when you're looking for the revival who is the revival i'm the revival where is the word the word is in me and you know it's like whether i i'm going to continue to claim that and believe that it's like well you know what you still got faults well you know we're all going to have faults but you know what i'm going to overcome them you know what there's still more grace to continue on glory it's not the man that falls down it's the man that gets back up i didn't start this race it was god god started me on this journey i didn't start it on my own i didn't choose this he chose me but he started me on this way and he began to continue and then so when when i realized who i am that i'm walking the way god wants me to walk and you know what if and i realize that if i get off the way if i get out of step if i get out of out of balance somewhere then you know what then the word of god is is obligated to come to me and speak to me to bring me back to bring me back into balance to bring me right back into the sight in the right place then you know what i can believe what god said so when i when i'm asking i can make my petitions known because that's my desire i want to know where i need to be lord show me where i need to be let me step into this word right here and feast on this word lord put me in the place that i need to be give me the words that need to be said that can speak to others in order to encourage them to edify them the lord just not just to be saying things but let's say something that's going to benefit the people let's let's get into the word and let's become the word and show the world who we are amen that's my why because god said in those last days that he's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle or any such thing he's going to show the devil this bride this eve will not fall like the last that's that second he won because he's promised that to you then you know what whatever you have need of you can claim amen then i can i will receive what's mine i've made my petition known i say thank the lord thank you lord because you've made that known to me i'm i'm claiming what's mine but you know what if you don't read if you don't read the wheel how do you know what your what your possession is how do you know what belongs to you but that's that's what we have this evening so god bless you let's all stand i want you i want you to be edified and get into the word of god whatever you have need of then you know what i'm so thankful that god said if you've got questions then you know what he said he'd put somebody in the pulpit to answer your questions praise god and you know what i think we got we've got a great fifo ministry here and if you have a if you have a need then you know what it's not it's not the men but i tell you what it's the god that's living in the in these men in this five-fold ministry that god will answer the questions and you know what because if you have confusion god's not the author of confusion he is the he's the author that he's going to bring you clarity amen right yes sir yes because the word is i said yes amen amen let's have the musicians coming so if you have a need this evening then he's here to meet your need that's right amanda and all you gotta do is i look like my little story you know all you got to do is that's a bank draft on heaven so all you got to do is fill it out and you know when you when you've got when you've got access to a bank account like wade when he had a business you know and you had money in the bank and you had to write checks and and do things like that you know when you write checks and everything like that you don't have to ask them because you know what it don't belong to them it's your money and i'm gonna do with my money so if it's your possession that god gave it to you then it's a bank draft on heaven then you know what then you know that don't be afraid i you know because let me tell you what if you have kids they they don't have a problem spending your money unless unless your kids are different i ain't met a kid yet don't mind spending your money i think it was i think it was levi levi was a what was the most generous kid we had he had friends and he hit by him ice cream and and all kinds everybody needed something he was buying it up and he'd always and sarah was trying to figure out where all his lunch money was going it's like listen you can spend your money like that quit spending my money like it's to help some folks out but not in it i think about what margaret thatcher the former prime minister of britain said the problem with socialism was after sooner or later you run out of other people's money that was a problem you're running out of our money but if you have if you have the money then you know what then spend it yeah to get the things that you have need of it's a bank draft on heaven yeah so you know because you know healing it's it's the it's the children's bread it's yours you don't have to worry about it will god heal me it's already finished work at calvary so whatever you have need of and it's like well i i've if you're seeking the holy ghost now you know what it's for you it's a promise that's right and he said well lord i'm born again but i don't know where i want to come the statue of a perfect man i want to get these virtues then you know what they are required but you know what god's made a way for you to get them then you know what there's and there's a prescription right here if you get in the word and you begin to feed on the word then you know what it comes to you amen and so it's just like everything else it's as you feed on the word and you grow and the lord begins to reveal things to you he begins to open the word to you right but you know what it's it's not it's not hard all right you know you know i know y'all won't believe this but i'm going to tell you anyway it might be hard to believe but you know what i didn't have to struggle and strive and go through all of this to get this big i know y'all won't believe that but that's true you know what because i used to tell you richard not here but i used to tell her he's kidding he said well aaron was on like his 30 seconds before i could get to my second plate of food i was like well you're slow yeah i come to get mine i don't know about you but you know what you know it's like you know if if a whopper was is good a double offer is better if a big mac's good a big mac two big macs is better and that's and that's that's how you get here if one shot piece of chocolate is good two's better and what you do you just keep on you just keep on feeding well let me tell you something it's the same way in the gospels if one message is good then you ought to have two man and you know what if if and and it's i talked to people and i tell them i said you know what they sing that song sweet hour of prayer i think this reason they took it out a lot of churches because nobody ever does it anymore people people couldn't figure out what an hour of prayer was anyway but uh maybe five ten minutes whatever but you know what if prayer is good then you want more prayer yeah he said how do you get closer to god he said if you just read your bible and pray then just continue to feed and you know i i i like being at work i get on the roof sometimes by myself and i i put my earbud in i get my phone out turn it on and i'm i'm listening i'm listening to preaching and i and i just sit and listen to preaching all day and it's like you know what then i have to stop sometimes and and have taken have taken a momentary break you know because sometimes things you see things in the scripture and it's like well nobody's up here so yeah yeah i i can i can have church up here by myself just me and me and the and the gra and y'all wouldn't believe this but there's grasshoppers on there and i got birds up there and little creepy crawly things and it's just me and the bugs and the birds and we have church man but you know what i enjoy that yes yes it's the greatest time of the day you get up and hear some good preaching it's like when everything goes wrong and you don't know what to do you just hear some good music some good preaching you start hearing the voice of god and i tell you what it'll stir your soul it'll change it change your atmosphere it may not change it may not change your the conditions around you but it'll change your it'll change it don't change the environment but it'll change your atmosphere amen amen well god bless you tonight i'm gonna i'm gonna stop here uh sister
