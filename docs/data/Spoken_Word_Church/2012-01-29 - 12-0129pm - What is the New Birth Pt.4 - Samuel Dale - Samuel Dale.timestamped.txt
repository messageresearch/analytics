[18:09] in jesus' name amen amen John
[18:19] 3 there was a man of the Pharisees named
[18:22] Nicodemus the ruler of the Jews the same
[18:25] came to Jesus by night and said unto him
[18:27] Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[18:30] verse 10 says Thou Art a teacher brother
[18:32] R said the original said art the
[18:35] teacher all right so then coming down
[18:37] there are a teacher come from God for no
[18:40] man can do these M Jesus refer he's
[18:44] referring to Jesus is being the teacher
[18:46] and and Jesus refers to him as being the
[18:48] teacher let me get it right now we want
[18:51] misunderstand Rabbi know we know that th
[18:53] are a teacher come from God for no man
[18:55] can do these Miracles that thou doest
[18:57] except God be with him
[18:59] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[19:01] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[19:03] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[19:05] God Nicodemus sayth unto him how can a
[19:08] man be born when he is old can he enter
[19:11] the second time into his mother's W and
[19:13] be born Jesus answered verily verily I
[19:15] say unto thee except a man be born of
[19:18] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[19:21] into the kingdom of God that which is
[19:23] born of the flesh is flesh and that
[19:25] which is born of the spirit is Spirit
[19:27] Marvel not that I said unto thee you
[19:30] must be borned again now let's go to
[19:33] acts
[19:35] 1 verse
[19:39] 8 but you shall repeat see Power the
[19:42] Lord Jesus speaking see to the disciples
[19:44] and you shall receive power after that
[19:46] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[19:48] shall be Witnesses of me both in
[19:50] Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria
[19:53] and unto the uttermost part of the earth
[19:56] okay then Acts 2 and when the day of
[19:59] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[20:01] in one Accord in one place and
[20:05] suddenly Accord Accord in one place and
[20:08] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[20:10] as of rushing Mighty Wind and filled all
[20:12] the house where they were sitting there
[20:14] appeared unto them clothing tongues like
[20:16] as of fire and it set upon each of them
[20:19] and they were all filled with the Holy
[20:20] Ghost and began to speak with tongues as
[20:22] the spirit gave them utterance you may
[20:25] be seated the Lord at his Blessing to
[20:28] the reading of the
[20:30] word
[20:32] now I want
[20:36] to you know just kind
[20:40] of preach across for a little bit and
[20:44] then we'll back up and go through the
[20:47] things that you know we need to and this
[20:51] can be counted in as one of those things
[20:54] of the doctrines that I said I would get
[20:56] to eventually and preach on some of the
[20:58] the doctrines of the people of the
[20:59] message that and the reason I don't
[21:02] believe them and what I believe the
[21:04] truth is you know and this can be
[21:06] counted in with that too
[21:09] because uh if you go out among the
[21:12] denominations and everything and you ask
[21:14] them what is the new birth and one's
[21:17] going to tell you this and one's going
[21:18] to tell you that and uh you know
[21:21] different things and you be shouting
[21:24] speaking in tongues uh feelings is
[21:27] involved
[21:29] uh believing and just accepting and all
[21:32] kind of things that they'd be
[21:34] saying like then you come among the
[21:36] Believers of what you call the Believers
[21:39] of the message and uh you find that some
[21:41] of them are saying that well brother
[21:43] random change here and he changed there
[21:46] and uh it's you know uh pretty well
[21:49] among us just like it is anywhere else
[21:52] and uh but I want to just talk to us and
[21:55] just ask us what is the new birth
[21:59] now to follow that as I was saying this
[22:02] morning in the
[22:05] message if you approach something this a
[22:09] blunt statement like a lot of people try
[22:12] to and uh you know you say well what is
[22:16] the new
[22:17] birth well you can give a quote that
[22:20] it's the revelation of Jesus
[22:22] Christ uh you can give a quote that it's
[22:24] the baptism of the Holy
[22:26] Ghost uh you you got quotes that we'll
[22:29] get to in a few minutes you'll see that
[22:31] brother ROM calls
[22:33] believing the new
[22:35] birth then he will talk about the being
[22:38] baptized into the body that's the new
[22:41] birth and he'll talk about just that
[22:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost as being in
[22:46] the body that's we talking about New
[22:48] Birth now right all right and then uh if
[22:52] we have time we'll conclude by bringing
[22:54] it to what I believe is what he was
[22:56] really bringing it all to
[22:59] is that the headstone uniting with the
[23:01] body will be the new
[23:02] birth which will
[23:05] um end up ever how you want to say it by
[23:10] the change of this body and we'll step
[23:12] into eternity Body Spirit and soul and
[23:15] then you can say you got the new birth
[23:17] all right so then it's a vast thing to
[23:20] be covered and it would take it took the
[23:23] prophet um 40 years so if we go that
[23:28] long this afternoon you know we try not
[23:31] to but uh I want to make sure that we
[23:34] get it right then if you want to have
[23:35] questions and answers on it I'm I'm
[23:38] always pleased to to have questions and
[23:41] answers now if you misunderstand
[23:43] something I
[23:44] say uh the only thing I would ask you to
[23:47] do I would ask you to do one thing it
[23:49] may solve a lot of
[23:51] problems if you have a something that
[23:54] you misunderstand write it
[23:56] down all J it down what I'm
[23:59] speaking you know did you mean this did
[24:01] you mean that what write it down you
[24:03] know all right but they not ask you to
[24:04] do one thing to my save some problems in
[24:07] time is to go back and listen to the
[24:12] tape you know and and you know kind of
[24:15] Mark if you want to the time and say
[24:19] well it's got to be in the first half of
[24:20] the you know it's got to be in the first
[24:22] hour you might save you a lot of trouble
[24:24] trying to find it on the tape but go to
[24:27] the tape and listen to it to see because
[24:30] in that way and I probably will too
[24:32] myself because I can I know I can make
[24:35] human errors in speech and and being a
[24:38] human being I'm sorry but I will do that
[24:41] as a human being and and it doesn't
[24:44] bother me for somebody to say you said
[24:46] so and so all right as long as I said it
[24:48] it doesn't bother me I can go back and
[24:50] correct it I can say well that's exactly
[24:53] what I meant you know or I can say now
[24:56] you heard me say this this is what I
[24:58] meant got to be like brother R said but
[25:00] that fell you know said don't take what
[25:02] I say said take what I meant you know so
[25:05] that way let the Holy Spirit be in you
[25:08] to to help and to do and and to give an
[25:13] understanding because it is a vast
[25:15] territory and I told you this morning
[25:18] one key to it is that brother brandom
[25:22] the ages as they came down and that was
[25:25] so marvelous to me when I seen it when
[25:27] he started preaching you know when I
[25:28] first started reading of the message and
[25:31] how that he would talk about Luther's
[25:34] justification Wesley sanctification
[25:36] Pentecostal baptism and he say when now
[25:39] here come the Presbyterian restoring
[25:41] some of of the predestination here would
[25:44] come the Baptist with the immersing down
[25:47] in the water you know the baptizo and
[25:50] and doing those things and U you know
[25:53] that was to me was an amazing thing to
[25:56] think about how God could keep this
[25:58] thing so straight and then a prophet
[26:01] would come cuz see we never had anybody
[26:04] back there to be able to help us uh you
[26:07] know I mean we were Baptist and they
[26:09] just said all you got to do to believe
[26:11] and I then I asked them I said well how
[26:13] come it says believe us right it doesn't
[26:15] say just believe it says believe us you
[26:19] know and and I wanted to
[26:22] know and you know and then as I always
[26:25] try to say that I didn't just accept the
[26:29] fact that I Was Born Again by just
[26:32] something that happened something that
[26:34] took place I've told you about seeing
[26:37] God in a form in a church about 11 years
[26:39] old I never took that as my new
[26:41] birth uh I come to a place one day if
[26:44] you have asked me after I joined the
[26:46] church there in the Baptist form I would
[26:49] have said that was my new birth that I
[26:51] believed on the Lord Jesus Christ but
[26:54] then when I came into the message and
[26:57] seen how the prophet was expressing
[26:59] thing even in seemingly contradictory I
[27:02] said seemingly now contradictory
[27:06] statements I was
[27:08] still happy to see the things that he
[27:11] was saying and then I realized that I
[27:13] was not born again and then it was 2
[27:16] years before I received the baptism of
[27:17] the Holy Ghost you know and and all of
[27:20] that but uh you know after I come into
[27:23] the
[27:24] message but that was an amazing thing to
[27:27] look back and see just ification see
[27:29] that your church went
[27:31] down it come on the day of Pentecost
[27:34] come over through the the Dark Ages went
[27:36] down into the ground and came back out
[27:38] with two little shoots of Luther with
[27:40] the just shall live by faith and then
[27:42] wesle we come along preaching
[27:45] sanctification all right and then the
[27:47] Pentecostals with the baptism of the
[27:48] Holy Ghost and I believe that those
[27:52] people down through there I'm not like
[27:53] some that say that people have said you
[27:57] know that
[27:58] that Luther wesle and Pentecost didn't
[28:01] have nothing now I don't agree with that
[28:04] I believe it was the new birth in the
[28:05] days of Luther and there is a direct
[28:08] quote I'll be glad to find for you I was
[28:09] looking at it this morning that brother
[28:11] around that said called the sa the new
[28:13] birth of
[28:15] sanctification all right but you see you
[28:17] got to remember that they can only be
[28:20] responsible for what they heard you're
[28:22] coming out of the dark ages of the thing
[28:24] that where it had U Been beat down or
[28:28] whatever you want to use the word for
[28:30] eating down until uh basically all they
[28:33] had was and I was reading a little bit
[28:34] about the Bible the other day and
[28:37] basically all they had was just certain
[28:39] scriptures that they were allowed to
[28:41] read you know through the Consol
[28:44] Catholicism age and uh you know they
[28:48] didn't have a Bible they would even burn
[28:50] them and try to destroy them and their
[28:53] point was that we don't want the uh
[28:56] Bible to be put into the hand of
[28:59] illiterate people now I'm quoting them
[29:02] you know and saying that because you
[29:05] would have the illiterate trying to
[29:07] understand God and said it can't be
[29:09] understood by the illiterate folks you
[29:12] know but
[29:13] see I differ on that amen and all but
[29:17] you know but in seeing that their
[29:21] thoughts maybe was good to protect or do
[29:24] but yet it kept the Bible from being in
[29:26] people's hands but didn't stop God right
[29:30] amen he went on with the WFTS and the
[29:33] the the the different ones that brought
[29:36] the different forms of the Bible and
[29:37] brought them into Germany and brought
[29:40] all kind of of doings and and coming
[29:43] down through there and and keeping it to
[29:45] leaving the Catholic Church bringing
[29:47] your uh different things that they kept
[29:51] uh the what is the got it the
[29:55] U I'll take a minute about the Catholics
[29:58] uh Latin vate uh and and see even God
[30:01] made the Catholic Church preserve the
[30:06] Bible you know he made them even
[30:08] preserve it
[30:10] correctly even though they wouldn't let
[30:12] their people have it right he made them
[30:15] preserve it to where later that it could
[30:17] be brought out you know and put into
[30:19] what we call the Bible of today you know
[30:22] to understand so it's wonderful to look
[30:24] back there so then I believe now I'm
[30:26] telling you what I believe up for and
[30:28] then we'll get on to the to the message
[30:30] I believe that the lutherans that really
[30:33] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[30:34] the new
[30:36] birth need that strength that uh they
[30:40] when they believed on the Lord Jesus
[30:42] Christ and accepted him as their savior
[30:44] that was the new birth right the just
[30:47] shall live by
[30:48] faith see and that brought a new birth
[30:52] all right so then you go on to the other
[30:54] different people coming up and and God
[30:57] adding to the church now not what some
[30:59] man come up with the idea but Wesley
[31:01] coming along with
[31:02] sanctification uh that would be the new
[31:04] birth the Baptist people coming along
[31:07] with with John Smith and them with the
[31:09] the doctrine of baptism and you know
[31:11] baptizo bring putting you down in the
[31:13] water and the different things being
[31:16] restored and and each age coming down
[31:18] even to your your Pilgrim Holiness and
[31:22] things like that those were a move of
[31:23] God in the
[31:25] time then you come into the Pentecost
[31:28] and then you come on into the the hour
[31:31] that we're living and see I believe that
[31:33] the people there that were really born
[31:35] they were people that are really born
[31:36] again in each one of those ages right
[31:39] because if they wasn't born again how
[31:40] are they going to get born
[31:42] again all right but yet it's not it was
[31:45] required only of believing on the Lord
[31:48] Jesus Christ as not understand what I'm
[31:52] saying what was the Catholic Church
[31:54] doing when Luther said to Jos you live
[31:55] by faith they were teaching believe on
[31:58] the Lord Jesus
[31:59] Christ come on right I mean they were
[32:02] teaching believe on the Lord Jesus
[32:04] Christ but didn't they had the marriage
[32:05] and all the other involved but they were
[32:07] still teaching believe on the Lord Jesus
[32:09] Christ for your salvation all right we
[32:13] see then when Luther came out with it it
[32:16] just struck him to just shall live by
[32:18] faith because they had salvation based
[32:21] upon purely works and doings and and
[32:24] things like that and even that's why
[32:27] brother Ram
[32:28] not throw off on the Catholics like
[32:30] everybody thinks he does but he said the
[32:32] original church was Catholic right
[32:35] youever heard him say that the original
[32:38] church was Catholic CU Catholic means
[32:41] Universal that's all it means it
[32:43] Universal all right and he said they
[32:45] were say they were the original and they
[32:48] were he said all but everything cabbage
[32:52] down brought it down to a basis that you
[32:55] know you can go through the uh I will
[32:57] restore
[32:58] Etc the canor palor Locust caterpillar
[33:02] but just getting down to the the doings
[33:05] brother random would not go back and
[33:06] cover a lot then he would just cover
[33:09] justification under Luther
[33:11] sanctification under Wesley baptism of
[33:14] the Holy Ghost under the Pentecostals
[33:16] all right now not that each one wasn't
[33:19] getting the birth but the Lutheran
[33:21] didn't get the
[33:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost like they got
[33:26] it on the day of Pentecost
[33:28] of the works and you talk what I'm
[33:32] talking about three stages they got the
[33:35] New Birth by believing right all right
[33:39] Wesley and them got second work but that
[33:42] was still not like the book of Acts and
[33:44] the basis that it was still the new
[33:47] birth but not the basis of the second
[33:50] work of you know second stage and then
[33:53] when you come into isusa Street then
[33:56] your original Pentecost costal people
[33:58] required you to go through justification
[34:01] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[34:03] Ghost to be called in your birth you
[34:05] just didn't walk in on original right
[34:08] ones now pure ones true ones are you
[34:11] following me yes so if you miss me
[34:14] somewhere you come listen to that I said
[34:16] right ones pure ones true ones I didn't
[34:19] say
[34:20] everybody don't everybody spoke in tongu
[34:22] brother R said didn't have it right so
[34:25] if they didn't have it they didn't teach
[34:26] it right amen right but see the true
[34:29] were teaching as much as they could and
[34:32] even ausa Street was
[34:35] trinitarians 1906 isusa Street was
[34:39] trinitarians it was like about
[34:41] 1912 somewhere in there 14 before that
[34:45] you come along with the Oneness
[34:48] Doctrine being taught but that didn't
[34:51] still didn't mean that God couldn't give
[34:52] him the baptism of the Holy Co CU he did
[34:57] and see in that way brother random would
[35:00] say he said I met people that receive
[35:04] the Holy Ghost might say 50 years or
[35:07] something before him he said
[35:10] exactly like the day of
[35:13] Pentecost well then the preachers in
[35:15] this message go HeyWire trying to figure
[35:18] that one
[35:19] out don't they say well there all we
[35:22] look at them people look what they
[35:23] didn't have nothing we look at it and he
[35:26] says they had the Holy Ghost
[35:28] well then I remember I took that topic
[35:31] and broke it
[35:33] down to where on the day of Pentecost
[35:35] there was two things took place one was
[35:38] The Upper Room experience of 120 that
[35:42] had been
[35:43] tutored for three and a half years they
[35:46] had went through as we talked about this
[35:48] morning justification
[35:51] sanctification all right they had the
[35:54] gifts working they had the the uh the
[35:57] dad they saw it raised they they had all
[36:00] of the gifts he gave them power to do
[36:02] all of these things all right and that
[36:05] was only under
[36:07] sanctification all right
[36:12] now so then when the Holy Ghost did come
[36:16] it quickened 120 and put them and I'll
[36:19] point to the pyramid for others it's the
[36:22] pyramid we look at you know Faith virt
[36:24] knowledge temp here's where you see Holy
[36:27] Spirit
[36:29] the 120 received the Holy Spirit right
[36:32] there cuz they' been two to 3 and9 years
[36:35] they went outside pre preached the
[36:37] sermon you know 3,000 got
[36:40] saved they didn't have enough word to be
[36:42] up here they come in the body at Christ
[36:46] I mean Faith but that was a new birth so
[36:49] brother around said he met people with a
[36:51] new
[36:52] birth just like the day of Pentecost
[36:54] he's exactly right right when you
[36:57] receive the new birth justification
[36:59] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[37:02] the new birth you get it exactly like
[37:05] the 3,000 got it right you don't get it
[37:07] like the apostles got it you got to grow
[37:10] in Grace and knowledge right and coming
[37:13] up to that point all right now in
[37:17] looking at it that way we can see that
[37:19] the the things brother around said are
[37:21] not contradictory right they need to be
[37:23] placed in
[37:25] order all right and placing it in order
[37:29] we come to a better understanding of
[37:31] what he's saying okay
[37:34] now so we see the ages ties
[37:38] together with the new
[37:41] birth the seals tie together because we
[37:44] ended up with the quote about the the
[37:46] seals opening and the clim being placed
[37:48] upon us so they would be that and he
[37:51] said there's a mysterious part in the
[37:53] seal book of justification
[37:56] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[37:58] Ghost in This Day to be understood
[38:01] because of the opening of the seals amen
[38:04] all right so that would mean down
[38:06] through there even though Paul and them
[38:09] had a great understanding about the
[38:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost great
[38:13] understanding about the
[38:14] godhead but still there would be things
[38:17] in the end time that would be revealed
[38:20] through or by way of the Prophet Amen to
[38:25] bring us the message all right now that
[38:28] would work out then to tie together
[38:31] everything brother brand says everything
[38:33] the Bible would say about
[38:36] it and placing it in order that if we
[38:39] get it laid in order it'll make a
[38:40] beautiful picture amen but if we fail to
[38:44] then we will miss it all right so now
[38:47] here's what I want you to believe I mean
[38:49] want you to listen to me not believe it
[38:52] you pray for God to reveal it to you I
[38:56] just preach all right
[38:59] I believe you can call the New
[39:01] Birth Believing on the Lord Jesus
[39:05] Christ cuz that's what Luther did
[39:11] right you can call the New Birth
[39:15] sanctification because that's what
[39:17] Wesley
[39:19] did you can call them the new
[39:22] birth as the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:26] cuz that's what ausa street
[39:28] did all
[39:30] right and you can place it then in order
[39:34] and it'll come out to make a beautiful
[39:36] picture to see the Plan of Salvation for
[39:40] world for man for the ages for time and
[39:43] everything fits into a beautiful
[39:46] category all right
[39:48] now so when I go through I'll try to
[39:51] stop and express this is what I'm
[39:54] saying this is what brother R is saying
[39:57] this this is what I'm saying this is
[39:59] what he's saying so you know because I
[40:02] want you to understand and at least you
[40:04] have the
[40:06] information I am one that will give you
[40:08] information I look at some quotes
[40:10] sometimes and I do decide not to bring
[40:13] them because maybe it would be confusing
[40:16] to the younger ones but uh I'll be glad
[40:19] to put them in anytime you want one put
[40:21] in to you know something you said run
[40:24] around said so and so well bring it to
[40:26] me I'll be glad to place it within and
[40:28] and do it all right but
[40:33] now see then I I said I believe the new
[40:38] birth and run around and preach the
[40:40] message you must be born
[40:45] again and on that message I think it's
[40:50] 59 he said I can conclusively prove
[40:53] something in those words a little
[40:55] paraphrasing that you're born again and
[40:57] then baptize into the
[41:00] body we'll read in a minute where the
[41:02] Prophet will
[41:04] say
[41:06] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[41:08] not the New
[41:10] Birth the new birth is when you
[41:17] believe and then he'll explain who he's
[41:19] talking
[41:23] about you'll say well and that's hold
[41:27] this point because it is true brother
[41:30] Ram is preaching the new birth and then
[41:32] he's preaching
[41:33] adoption to go in with that to bring you
[41:37] into those
[41:38] forms but he'll tell you there's one in
[41:40] here I know or twoo where he says that
[41:44] the people received the new
[41:45] birth they were there under a
[41:50] poish before Paul came to him and said
[41:53] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[41:54] you believe
[41:57] well then you'll see what he's doing and
[42:00] then he can
[42:02] say that when you believe you receive
[42:06] eternal
[42:10] life you say the baptism of the Holy
[42:12] Ghost only positions you in the body of
[42:15] Christ for the gifts for the
[42:20] power and these are the things will be
[42:22] read through
[42:24] here it must come together to
[42:27] to bring a correct understanding all
[42:31] right and doing that let's take one
[42:34] scripture brother's going to put it up
[42:37] some put up first
[42:39] Peter we're familiar scripture with us
[42:42] First Peter
[42:45] 1 22 and
[42:49] 23 Peter
[42:52] says seeing you have purified your souls
[42:54] and obeying the truth through the Spirit
[42:57] unto unfine love of the Brethren see
[42:59] that you love one another with a pure
[43:00] heart fervently being born
[43:04] again not of corruptible seed but of
[43:08] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[43:10] liveth and abideth forever
[43:13] now being born
[43:17] again is a word using being means a
[43:21] process right of going on something is
[43:25] transpiring
[43:27] you are being born
[43:30] again all
[43:32] right now we'll read in a little while
[43:34] where brother R says your new birth
[43:36] starts when you
[43:41] believe he said but brother I've always
[43:43] thought it was the baptism you know
[43:45] Earth see Pentecostal thought filtering
[43:47] through your
[43:48] mind and the people of this message
[43:50] still have that CU some of them believe
[43:53] that brother R was wrong and later he
[43:55] said it's just the baptism well 64
[43:59] Christ U Future home he said he taught
[44:03] three processors or phases stages all
[44:07] the way through his
[44:09] life and if you'll notice the
[44:11] interlacing that I chose the word that
[44:14] I'll use one of
[44:17] 54 61 59 backwards and
[44:21] forth and then you have to look at it
[44:23] and say but yeah now wait a minute
[44:24] brother Dale what we want is I what's
[44:27] after the
[44:31] seals well then you're rejecting the
[44:34] message and how could it be that brother
[44:37] Ram could preach anything if he didn't
[44:39] have a
[44:40] foundation and if his foundation was not
[44:44] correct then how could God come and
[44:46] bring the seals
[44:49] okay and when he went beyond the curtain
[44:51] of time he said I preach what Paul
[44:54] preached and the people holiday men
[44:58] so then it's not to just say well you
[45:01] just confusing me no
[45:03] no I ain't going to confuse nobody today
[45:07] I'm going to try to straighten out
[45:09] confusion bless all right because we
[45:13] born that
[45:14] way
[45:16] right and our mind runs on the wrong
[45:21] Channel all right so we need to get it
[45:23] right all right so being born again
[45:29] meaning something
[45:32] starts it keeps on
[45:34] going it gets greater and
[45:37] greater until it is
[45:40] finally consummated finished whatever
[45:43] the word amen in what God intended for
[45:47] it to do amen amen that's right and I
[45:50] said I believe that you can believe on
[45:52] the Lord Jesus
[45:54] Christ and you be baptized into the body
[45:58] then this body can be
[45:59] changed and we go meet the Lord and we
[46:02] say we got the new birth right go we're
[46:06] being born again amen how I like the
[46:11] scripture you didn't say being born
[46:13] again is because of an act taking place
[46:16] right how are you being born again
[46:22] by the word of God that's right right
[46:26] not by the corruptible seed of man not
[46:29] by doctrines or
[46:31] ideas and as I was saying a while ago
[46:34] then when you receive the new birth
[46:36] everybody since the day of Pentecost
[46:38] except 120 receives the new birth right
[46:41] here at
[46:43] Faith and then you're being born
[46:47] again adding to your faith Ro your
[46:50] knowledge temper face Godless brother
[46:51] kind and come out to the headstone all
[46:53] right now so let's start with the it's
[46:57] getting to the point now and uh we lost
[47:00] 30 minutes but that's all right
[47:04] amen now I
[47:06] believe in this day everybody with me
[47:10] this day yes I explained Luther explain
[47:13] Wesley in this
[47:15] day believing is not the new
[47:18] birth in the day that we're living
[47:22] right all right sanctification is not
[47:26] the new birth in the day we're
[47:29] living the
[47:31] baptism now
[47:34] listen now you going to jump with me so
[47:36] hold on to the point the baptism is not
[47:39] the new birth in this day
[47:42] right now listen the new birth
[47:47] today that will go all the way and
[47:49] through and finish with the chain the
[47:51] new birth is justification
[47:54] sanctification and the baptism of the
[47:56] Holy Ghost
[47:58] that's
[47:59] right do you follow me when we get down
[48:01] in a minute brother Brown say they say
[48:03] the baptism is the new birth he said
[48:06] they're
[48:09] wrong see in this day it's justification
[48:13] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[48:17] Ghost you cannot be born again today
[48:19] without going through
[48:21] justification sanctification and the
[48:23] baptism of the Holy
[48:25] Ghost all right I make it blunt where
[48:28] everybody will understand me and that's
[48:30] what I believe all
[48:33] right and in doing that
[48:36] then that you you can be
[48:40] justified without receiving the Holy
[48:42] Ghost you can be Sanctified without
[48:44] receiving
[48:47] it but you can't be baptized into the
[48:51] body without being justified Sanctified
[48:55] and filled with the Holy Ghost in the
[48:56] this
[48:59] day since theusa Street started with the
[49:01] three it came back that's what it's
[49:04] required brother Brown said the last
[49:06] three
[49:08] ages completed the
[49:10] birth we'll give that in a minute I
[49:13] think it's in my
[49:14] notes so now let's let's just read some
[49:17] things that we're not talking about let
[49:19] me read it let me say this I am not
[49:23] talking about anointed ones forget it
[49:25] forget it okay
[49:27] and see your your mind will run anointed
[49:29] ones where the Prophet would say the
[49:32] anointed ones can have the genuine
[49:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost right that's
[49:36] right on their Spirit come on and still
[49:40] be lost right right right read or listen
[49:43] to anointed once in
[49:45] time but you can't have the baptism of
[49:47] the Holy Ghost in your soul right and
[49:51] ever be lost right cuz there's no way of
[49:54] it because it would play so you're going
[49:57] to have to listen real
[49:59] careful and as I said then when you
[50:01] misunderstand me or anybody on tape
[50:03] anywhere listening when you hear this
[50:07] you go back and you listen to what I
[50:09] said and you might find out it answers
[50:12] your question before you call me but
[50:15] don't worry about it call me from
[50:17] anywhere in the world except please make
[50:20] up I get you 3:00 in the morning
[50:23] from Zimbabwe
[50:26] or or something like that I mean they
[50:30] just don't calculate they just di it up
[50:32] you know and then I can't understand
[50:34] them we've got a phone that we run it up
[50:36] that I get on to it you know where I can
[50:38] at least hear the words but I'll tell
[50:41] them to please slow down
[50:44] yes I'm having trouble understanding you
[50:48] right well then they say okay
[50:51] brother I'm not throwing off on them now
[50:54] right I'm just telling like it is right
[50:57] all right so if you call me I used to
[51:00] have a brother used to call me
[51:02] 12:01 he's here in the United States you
[51:05] know why go on that day the rate changed
[51:07] at 12 oh
[51:11] my oh my I was working at General Motors
[51:13] getting up at 4:00 you know all right I
[51:17] told my brother I'll pay the phone call
[51:20] call me reverse a charge just call me
[51:23] before
[51:24] 10 but you know just get that going to
[51:27] shake you off where you won't be so
[51:29] tired about what I've preached up so
[51:33] far but now you can be justified and
[51:36] Sanctified without receiving the baptism
[51:38] of the Holy Ghost but now watch brother
[51:41] R I think it's in
[51:43] here he says you can't
[51:50] have baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[51:54] having the father and the son right
[52:01] right right you you can't have it you
[52:02] can't divide it up see if you divided it
[52:05] up so you're going to get you three gods
[52:06] in there you're going to mess up things
[52:09] if you say you have the baptism of the
[52:10] Holy Ghost and that baptism of the Holy
[52:12] Ghost is the spirit of
[52:14] God or if you call it the father or you
[52:18] call it the spirit of
[52:20] Christ whatever you're saying there's
[52:22] just one God right right so you can't
[52:26] have the father without having the son
[52:29] that's right all right are you with me
[52:32] amen you can't have the baptism of the
[52:34] Holy Ghost without having the father
[52:36] right so you you see it's going to take
[52:38] a vast amount of time to tie
[52:41] together the Loose Ends to where it all
[52:43] come together and you'll see when
[52:45] brother R was saying what he was saying
[52:46] he was
[52:47] right at least I hope so all right so
[52:52] we're not talking about anointed ones to
[52:53] end time forget it right that's twice
[52:56] stat it you come up with something you
[52:59] know we why there you don't understand
[53:00] about this I'm not talking about
[53:02] anointed ones I'm talking about genuine
[53:05] Born Again Holy Ghost filed Christian
[53:08] the children of God right okay not
[53:11] talking about anointing ones
[53:15] right so now we want to look at some
[53:18] quotes and look at some things and see
[53:20] what to if we can piece
[53:24] together then you'll see why I I like to
[53:27] take a subject and then I
[53:30] wait I've been studying this subject for
[53:33] 40 something
[53:36] years knowing the thing seemingly
[53:38] contrary one to the other I've preached
[53:41] on it before and I do believe that
[53:44] brother R was trying to preach a
[53:47] dotion in his early Ministry but also
[53:51] known by his quotes that he was not just
[53:53] preaching
[53:54] adoption he was preaching the truth amen
[53:58] for the age and time or whatever it was
[54:00] all right
[54:02] sir how can you cover the new
[54:05] birth and leave out Luther and Wesley
[54:09] you can't do
[54:11] it Luther taught justification as
[54:14] Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ by
[54:17] faith and that was his new
[54:21] birth right that's
[54:24] right truly surely we know that he
[54:27] probably taught and made books and wrote
[54:31] essays or whatever you call them about
[54:33] the Lord Jesus
[54:35] Christ
[54:36] right and he claimed the Lord Jesus
[54:39] Christ for his
[54:41] salvation but God was going to start a
[54:45] work or to bring forth his
[54:48] word so Luth was reading there in the
[54:51] scripture about the just shall live by
[54:53] faith and he clicked and that was the
[54:57] new birth of that age right now others
[55:00] that were believ in
[55:02] Catholicism from their own now now you
[55:06] know there's overlaps so don't
[55:08] misunderstand me so I've never heard
[55:10] about it to give you an illustration
[55:14] somebody asked brother Bram to go talk
[55:16] to their
[55:17] father and to see where he was in the
[55:20] Lord he goes in Li and talks with him do
[55:23] say thing comes back out and this story
[55:25] was told and said
[55:26] your father's all right he's under
[55:28] another
[55:29] age if you're not responsible God
[55:33] doesn't hold you responsible until truth
[55:36] has been
[55:38] presented now those that back off
[55:40] somewhere never heard of of uh Martin
[55:44] Luther and all the things they may have
[55:48] been okay and God would went through it
[55:50] but those who heard Martin Luther teach
[55:53] the just shall live by faith it was
[55:55] required
[55:56] that they received that right that he
[56:00] was teaching to be in that body of
[56:03] Christ for that day so is it with
[56:08] Wesley so is it coming down to all
[56:12] ages see each
[56:16] believer had to accept the
[56:19] message that was presented to
[56:22] them that's why you'll hear Brother
[56:24] Brown say that the people want to stay
[56:27] in a denomination and
[56:30] claim the new birth or message of the
[56:37] age it's a good one is
[56:40] it you mean you could do that yes
[56:43] doesn't mean you got to go to the
[56:44] Baptist to stay in the age it don't mean
[56:47] you got to go to the Pentecost to stay
[56:48] in the age it means you got that mindset
[56:51] you got that understanding you got that
[56:54] thought and so you can be CL you're in
[56:56] the
[56:57] message claim to be in the message and
[57:00] not have the baptism of the Holy
[57:02] Ghost that's why that that's not the
[57:04] evidence the evidence is whether or not
[57:06] the spirit of God in you will agree with
[57:09] the word right if it's not in there it
[57:12] won't agree that's right simple language
[57:15] but that's what your Prophet said all
[57:17] right see the true Pentecostals now
[57:19] notice I use the word true and thing
[57:22] like that so you won't be dealing with
[57:23] this everybody in their fanaticism
[57:27] the true Pentecostals taught them the
[57:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost after you are
[57:31] Justified and Sanctified are they taught
[57:34] three stages of
[57:36] Grace and many of them did not get the
[57:40] new birth of their ages so let's pull up
[57:43] this and give a couple of quotes to
[57:45] start on the point number one
[57:50] brother look what brother R
[57:53] said well we found out this is from the
[57:55] message then Jesus came and
[57:58] called we found out many of them said
[58:01] they believed and didn't have
[58:04] it in the days of John Wesley if they
[58:08] got the Second Blessing they called it
[58:09] sanctification entire sanctification
[58:12] that's really a weirdo when you go to
[58:15] entire sanctification you really are
[58:17] going Beyond John Wesley he never taught
[58:19] entire
[58:21] sanctification they did after him they
[58:24] got happy and they shouted everybody
[58:26] shouted had it but they found out they
[58:28] didn't have it a lot of them shouted and
[58:30] didn't have it the days of
[58:33] Pentecost they said now the restoration
[58:36] of the gifts has come the baptism of the
[58:38] Holy Spirit he that speaks in tongues
[58:41] has got it we found out that many spoke
[58:43] in tongues and didn't have
[58:47] it you know that brother random talks
[58:49] about the the zeusa street
[58:52] Pentecost and he said the same holy
[58:54] ghost that justified the Luther sanctify
[58:57] the Methodist baptized the Pentecostals
[58:59] what is Now setting in order the coming
[59:01] of the
[59:03] Lord so he ties it all
[59:05] together just give you another one to
[59:07] where we'll have
[59:09] it first we would see Jesus
[59:12] 1964 304 Lutheran said when you believe
[59:16] that's all you have to do you're
[59:18] justified by faith believe many said
[59:21] they believ and didn't have
[59:24] it we know that Along Came Wesley with
[59:27] what with what called the second work of
[59:30] Grace sanctification all shouts and are
[59:32] Sanctified and got it many shouted
[59:35] didn't have it long come to Pentecost
[59:36] said all that speaks in tongues speaks
[59:39] with tongues has got it many spoke with
[59:41] tongues and didn't have it listen even
[59:43] comes along gets past that he comes in
[59:46] he said Along Comes the Christian
[59:47] Science and said it's love the fruit of
[59:49] the spirit many of them shows fruits of
[59:51] the spirit and don't have
[59:54] it so it's not just because what you say
[59:57] with your mouth it's what you
[1:00:01] possess you can say I'm a
[1:00:05] Christian I've been Justified Sanctified
[1:00:08] filled with the Holy Ghost all right now
[1:00:12] here's my
[1:00:13] point you ask them and say well what
[1:00:15] happened to
[1:00:17] you what do you mean what happened to
[1:00:21] me well what happened when you got
[1:00:24] Justified Saied f with all God
[1:00:26] well I just went to the Altar and I
[1:00:28] prayed through and got the Holy Ghost
[1:00:31] come up speaking in tongues now believe
[1:00:33] the
[1:00:37] message what the prophet said M said to
[1:00:40] got it didn't get
[1:00:42] it that don't mean
[1:00:44] everybody cuz there was genuine bride
[1:00:47] down to every age right right they
[1:00:50] really had the real
[1:00:53] goods and stood on the word all right
[1:00:57] what is required for the
[1:01:02] age brother R have went through explain
[1:01:05] what was required for each
[1:01:07] age all right but then what is required
[1:01:09] for this
[1:01:11] age to say that we're truly born
[1:01:14] again is we got to come to the three
[1:01:16] stages justification sanctification
[1:01:18] baptism and the Holy Ghost go ahead with
[1:01:20] number three
[1:01:23] brother preaching from a hidden life in
[1:01:25] ch Christ that's the same thing it takes
[1:01:28] to make up the new birth water blood and
[1:01:31] spirit justification by faith believing
[1:01:33] on the Lord Jesus Christ cleansing up
[1:01:37] the sanctification through the blood and
[1:01:39] then the baptism of the Holy Spirit to
[1:01:42] put you in the holiest of
[1:01:44] holies he said to put you in the holy of
[1:01:48] holies remember you had an outer
[1:01:51] Court the Old Testament you had an inner
[1:01:54] Court
[1:01:56] and then you had a holy of
[1:01:58] holies
[1:02:00] right a gentile could come into the
[1:02:03] outer
[1:02:04] court but he could not step into the
[1:02:07] inner court and only the high
[1:02:10] priest to go into the holy of holies
[1:02:13] right all right so now he's tied it all
[1:02:16] getting it all it's all tied
[1:02:20] together to put you in the holies of
[1:02:22] holies now that
[1:02:23] constitutes the man who is separated
[1:02:25] seated from God and hid away in Christ
[1:02:29] that don't mean you know what he's
[1:02:31] saying he ain't saying separated from
[1:02:32] God the man who separated and
[1:02:36] then he in Christ I say this with
[1:02:39] reverence to many of us playing in the
[1:02:41] hour the courts yet see we don't take
[1:02:44] our lives over we don't take our lives
[1:02:47] over with Christ to be hid away the
[1:02:50] fruits of the spirit Pro it see you see
[1:02:52] that we might think that what that we
[1:02:55] are are but until your life measures up
[1:02:58] with that that's what proves it Jesus
[1:03:00] said by their fruits you shall know them
[1:03:03] not by their denominations but by their
[1:03:05] fruits you shall know them there's one
[1:03:07] that would we could probably cover a
[1:03:09] long Doctrine
[1:03:12] on people say now it's not the fruit of
[1:03:14] the spirit kind no priest can have that
[1:03:17] that didn't do away with the fruits of
[1:03:18] the
[1:03:20] spirit right right did it do away with
[1:03:23] the fruits of the spirit CU kind no
[1:03:24] priest can have it
[1:03:26] m i I
[1:03:28] thought that fruit you know the fruits
[1:03:31] of the spirit was love joy peace
[1:03:33] goodness meekness that a true Christian
[1:03:36] had all right
[1:03:39] watch now watch this
[1:03:41] point look at number four
[1:03:45] now preaching on the
[1:03:48] countdown
[1:03:51] 1962 so if a man sits on the thought
[1:03:56] of just justification is all you have to
[1:04:00] have he's
[1:04:02] wrong
[1:04:04] wrong you got to be wrong and it's a
[1:04:07] church who believes like many other
[1:04:09] Pentecostals that the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:12] it that's all just repent and get the
[1:04:15] Holy
[1:04:16] Ghost that's still wrong because you got
[1:04:19] to get Sanctified in there to cleanse it
[1:04:22] before the Holy Ghost comes in if you
[1:04:24] don't you live leave out the blood see
[1:04:27] and the new
[1:04:29] birth as people talk that the baptism of
[1:04:32] the Holy Ghost is the new birth now
[1:04:35] that's
[1:04:37] wrong you're reading it
[1:04:40] now the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:43] different from the new
[1:04:50] Earth he say I believe everything
[1:04:52] brother Brown says
[1:04:57] I believe what's been revealed to
[1:05:02] me the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:05:04] different from the New Birth the new
[1:05:06] birth is when you're born
[1:05:09] again but the Holy Ghost is when power
[1:05:12] comes into that birth for service that's
[1:05:16] exactly the Holy Ghost is baptized into
[1:05:19] the Holy Ghost now remember that's
[1:05:23] 1962 right
[1:05:26] now remember and I'll repeat this a
[1:05:28] lot in the future home in
[1:05:33] 64 he said I taught three stages of
[1:05:37] Grace from the
[1:05:39] beginning never
[1:05:41] changed look like he's changing here
[1:05:44] doesn't
[1:05:46] it especially when he
[1:05:49] says people say that the baptism of the
[1:05:52] Holy
[1:05:53] Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost your is
[1:05:55] in your
[1:06:00] birth said well I'm
[1:06:03] confused well your Prophet
[1:06:07] said or you going to say he's
[1:06:11] confused that leaves it into our laps
[1:06:14] the wrong way doesn't it cuz we don't
[1:06:15] like that kind of
[1:06:16] language all
[1:06:19] right so now listen to what we're going
[1:06:23] to go to the next one number five
[1:06:28] now this is the countdown preached in 19
[1:06:31] excuse me that other was countdown but
[1:06:32] that was paragraph 37 this is
[1:06:37] 3839 the new
[1:06:39] birth you have the New Birth by
[1:06:43] being Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:46] see by having faith and accepting him as
[1:06:49] your savior that's birth see because you
[1:06:53] passed from death into life
[1:06:57] right if you want to back that up take
[1:06:59] John St John 5:24 he that Hearth my
[1:07:02] words and believeth on him that sent me
[1:07:04] has everlasting life he's got life
[1:07:07] because he
[1:07:09] believes and that same group that had to
[1:07:11] go to Pentecost to be baptized with the
[1:07:15] Holy
[1:07:17] Ghost now he's talking about the
[1:07:19] disciples
[1:07:22] right he talking about the disciples
[1:07:25] having eternal life by their new
[1:07:28] birth and Jesus Christ ain't died
[1:07:34] yet
[1:07:39] okay so where we at
[1:07:41] now holy ghost is power for service so
[1:07:45] when you talk about you got to be born
[1:07:46] again and applying that to the Holy
[1:07:49] Ghost many of the methodists and so
[1:07:51] forth are wrong there it cannot it just
[1:07:55] won cope through the scripture here you
[1:08:00] get the thing sideways it's got to take
[1:08:03] it the way the scriptures got it placed
[1:08:05] out here the and the Holy Spirit is he
[1:08:09] shall
[1:08:10] receive the new birth after this what no
[1:08:14] cuz that's not what the scripture said
[1:08:16] scripture says you shall receive
[1:08:18] power Acts 1:8 after the Holy Ghost has
[1:08:21] come upon you see and they had already
[1:08:24] believed to eternal life I talk about
[1:08:26] the disciples and so forth but they had
[1:08:28] to have the Holy Ghost for
[1:08:31] power he shall be Witnesses unto me
[1:08:33] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:08:36] because the Holy Ghost is a witness of
[1:08:37] the resurrection showing that you have
[1:08:40] become an adult in
[1:08:42] Christ
[1:08:45] now let's see if we really
[1:08:51] believe did they have eternal life in
[1:08:54] their soul
[1:08:58] if so Jesus didn't have to
[1:09:04] die so when you're correcting brother R
[1:09:07] I'm correcting
[1:09:09] you that blown
[1:09:13] enough my correcting brother R got no
[1:09:15] sense no better than
[1:09:17] that I know he knows what he talking
[1:09:19] about
[1:09:22] right but you see they were believing
[1:09:24] unto eternal life
[1:09:27] but as I said this morning there were a
[1:09:28] lot of people that believ
[1:09:32] Jesus but were worthy when the day of
[1:09:35] Pentecost
[1:09:36] came even seen of 500 Brethren after the
[1:09:42] resurrection where was the
[1:09:48] 380 and why brother Brandon will make
[1:09:50] the statement you are saved according to
[1:09:53] your confession
[1:09:56] you say you're a Christian you're a
[1:09:58] Christian you say you're not a Christian
[1:10:00] you're not a
[1:10:05] Christian now let's see if you can
[1:10:08] swallow are you going to say that Judas
[1:10:11] was not a
[1:10:16] Believer are you going to say that Judas
[1:10:19] wasn't Sanctified in St John 17
[1:10:30] let you
[1:10:32] think what are you going to
[1:10:35] say well you just got me confused I
[1:10:37] don't know what to say good you're in a
[1:10:39] good good place right if you really
[1:10:42] don't know what to
[1:10:43] say but if you get running your
[1:10:45] blabbering mouth you'll figure out
[1:10:49] something so
[1:10:51] Judas was believing unto eternal life
[1:10:54] that's right
[1:10:58] you can call it Born
[1:11:01] Again call it new
[1:11:06] birth but where he was at there was no
[1:11:09] way to
[1:11:10] receive eternal life in his soul
[1:11:16] right so he died and went to
[1:11:19] hell why because he turned down and
[1:11:22] proved that his justification and
[1:11:24] sanctification
[1:11:26] was not
[1:11:28] genuine now come on you will a me and
[1:11:31] more brother Rand will say people will
[1:11:33] say well you know this that say what
[1:11:36] about
[1:11:37] Judas he had part of the
[1:11:39] ministry the Bible said he
[1:11:43] did so brother random is having to be
[1:11:46] speaking
[1:11:49] of a believing unto eternal
[1:11:53] life you as I say said if you're
[1:11:55] Justified and you die in that place the
[1:11:58] prophet said sure you're going to
[1:12:02] heaven there's a lot of difference in
[1:12:04] going to heaven
[1:12:06] there's at least two ways to get
[1:12:09] there both of them to the blood of Jesus
[1:12:12] Christ but one of them can be a foolish
[1:12:13] virgin to be given eternal life later
[1:12:16] the other one has eternal life here lot
[1:12:18] of
[1:12:21] difference all right
[1:12:25] then the new birth is
[1:12:29] believing the disciples were
[1:12:33] Believers you can cover them as the New
[1:12:38] Birth when the scripture said that the
[1:12:40] spirit had not been given because Jesus
[1:12:42] had not been
[1:12:44] glorified so it was a
[1:12:49] potential
[1:12:52] right it was not a reality
[1:12:55] it was a reality Jesus Christ died in
[1:12:57] vain because all he had to do is turn
[1:12:59] around and give come on he had done give
[1:13:02] them the
[1:13:03] power right right the disciples had the
[1:13:07] power to cast out Devils heal the sick
[1:13:10] and all the things before they reive the
[1:13:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost he took the
[1:13:15] power away from
[1:13:17] them and told them to go to Jerusalem
[1:13:21] and abide and don't try to preach no
[1:13:24] more cuz you don't have the inside
[1:13:26] teacher so you can get
[1:13:28] confused and that's what the people in
[1:13:30] this message has done I'm going to say
[1:13:33] it you believe what you want to they
[1:13:35] don't wait for the teacher to be able to
[1:13:36] put the word
[1:13:41] together come on it's
[1:13:44] true they run off well I just got this
[1:13:46] quote and I got that quote how many
[1:13:48] quotes you want but if I've got one that
[1:13:50] turns it down what are you doing
[1:13:57] put it all
[1:13:58] together and let's
[1:14:01] see you say but I thought the new birth
[1:14:04] brother Dale for this age was the
[1:14:07] baptism of the Holy
[1:14:11] Spirit and that's
[1:14:14] true because the baptism of the holy
[1:14:16] spirit is justification sanctification
[1:14:19] the baptism of the holy
[1:14:21] spirit because what chopped off you pie
[1:14:24] sins was a Holy Spirit right what
[1:14:27] Sanctified you was the holy spirit amen
[1:14:30] what is the birth is the holy spirit
[1:14:35] amen see but the new birth for Lucifer's
[1:14:38] age which you just believe and accept
[1:14:40] that Jesus Paid the
[1:14:45] price so the new verse for the disciples
[1:14:48] that we just read
[1:14:51] about was to believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:14:54] Christ right
[1:14:58] that's why the new birth wasn't
[1:14:59] completed in Luther's
[1:15:01] age so you can call it a
[1:15:04] potential you can call it partial
[1:15:06] realization brother around we use those
[1:15:12] words you see in this age we got to come
[1:15:14] to a to the ending of all
[1:15:18] things but in this age it requires that
[1:15:20] we must accept the truth the truth of
[1:15:23] what now listen the truth the
[1:15:27] truth the truth of what Luther Tau all
[1:15:30] that you shall live by
[1:15:32] faith we've got to accept
[1:15:36] that now what all he talk trinitarian is
[1:15:39] I didn't say
[1:15:42] that we must accept what Wesley
[1:15:46] Tau
[1:15:48] right knowing that in Wesley's day if
[1:15:50] you looked at the the quotes that were
[1:15:52] up there the basics under Luther's
[1:15:54] message
[1:15:55] was sanctification by the chemistry of
[1:15:58] the blood
[1:16:00] right this is basically what he Tau get
[1:16:03] your song
[1:16:04] books and look at all the songs that was
[1:16:07] written in Wesley's age I know it was of
[1:16:14] Blood come
[1:16:17] on because Wesley
[1:16:20] thought that sanctification being the
[1:16:23] second stage
[1:16:26] was the chemistry of the
[1:16:30] blood come on go to the Token message
[1:16:33] and listen to brother brand explain it
[1:16:36] there's four of them you'll hear him
[1:16:38] explain it
[1:16:39] good Wesley thought it was the
[1:16:45] blood he said and we know now it's the
[1:16:48] life that was in the blood that's
[1:16:51] right it makes it
[1:16:53] different see so today we accept Jesus
[1:16:56] Christ as our
[1:16:57] savior as Luther taught it of the just
[1:17:00] shall live by faith and then we believe
[1:17:03] of the sanctification of Wesley that the
[1:17:06] blood does have a part to do in it
[1:17:08] because the life was in the blood and
[1:17:11] then blood of animal say you are not
[1:17:13] saved by the
[1:17:15] blood what's the rest of the quote you
[1:17:18] are kept saved by the blood that's right
[1:17:21] he said you're saved by grace through
[1:17:23] faith that's right
[1:17:26] amen you're kept saved by the
[1:17:29] blood right come on what you're Prophet
[1:17:33] say so the blood is a
[1:17:36] bumper over
[1:17:38] us to keep us
[1:17:42] saved right come on see today when we
[1:17:46] accept Jesus Christ as our
[1:17:48] savior that starts the new
[1:17:53] birth but it's not completed until we
[1:17:56] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:17:59] our
[1:18:00] soul
[1:18:01] right now remember how I've taught it
[1:18:04] before the P two messages justification
[1:18:06] doesn't do anything about the soul chops
[1:18:08] off the sin of the
[1:18:11] Soul we covered it this morning that
[1:18:13] sanctification starts dealing with the
[1:18:16] soul of the unclean spirit being driven
[1:18:18] out not just out of your body and
[1:18:21] spirit but been driven out of your soul
[1:18:24] right to make way for the
[1:18:27] baptism now let's read a few that sound
[1:18:30] astounding go ahead brother number
[1:18:34] six paragraph 363 365 questions and
[1:18:39] answers on the Hebrews part 2 57
[1:18:45] 102 we trying to make it just briefly
[1:18:48] plain as I know how to make
[1:18:50] it now when you believe on the Lord
[1:18:52] Jesus
[1:18:53] Christ you then have the new
[1:18:58] birth When You Believe on the Lord you
[1:19:00] receive a new thought a new
[1:19:04] life but it isn't the baptism of the
[1:19:06] Holy Ghost see you got the New Birth
[1:19:09] when you believe you've got eternal life
[1:19:13] it's a gift of God that's GI to you
[1:19:15] through Sovereign Grace by accepting the
[1:19:18] gift that God is giving to you see he
[1:19:21] that heareth my words and believeth on
[1:19:23] him that sent me half eternal life or is
[1:19:26] which the scripture as everlasting life
[1:19:29] that's the new birth you're
[1:19:32] converted it means you turned around but
[1:19:36] the baptism of the Holy Ghost puts you
[1:19:38] into the body of
[1:19:40] Christ subject to the gifts for
[1:19:44] service it doesn't make you any more of
[1:19:47] a
[1:19:51] Christian are you reading what he saying
[1:19:54] it just put you into the body of gifts
[1:19:56] see now by one Spirit 1 Corinthians 12
[1:19:59] we're all baptized into one body now
[1:20:02] Paul says there are different gifts and
[1:20:04] in this body it's nine spiritual gifts
[1:20:06] and this body you have to be baptized
[1:20:08] into the body to possess one of these
[1:20:10] gifts they come with the
[1:20:14] body so he
[1:20:21] says you're converted
[1:20:27] you accepted Jesus
[1:20:30] Christ now let's go on to the rest of
[1:20:32] that paragraph see but now as far as
[1:20:36] having eternal life and being a
[1:20:38] Christian you are a Christian the moment
[1:20:40] you
[1:20:43] believe
[1:20:45] amen now that's not make Bel I'm glad he
[1:20:49] put that in there CU it would come up me
[1:20:51] saying it right that's not make believe
[1:20:53] that's truly believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:20:55] Christ and accept him as your personal
[1:20:57] savior you're born again right there and
[1:21:00] have eternal life listen God comes into
[1:21:04] you you I'm in trouble
[1:21:09] saying now watch eternal life Jesus said
[1:21:12] he that hear my word and believeth on
[1:21:15] him that sent me at eternal life and
[1:21:17] shall not come into into the Judgment
[1:21:20] but pass from death into life you're a
[1:21:22] new creature right then then Paul had
[1:21:25] met some of these
[1:21:28] people now listen up in Acts
[1:21:34] 19 they had them a preacher by up there
[1:21:38] which was a converted lawyer by the name
[1:21:41] of Apollos and Apollos was a mighty man
[1:21:46] in the scriptures and he was proving by
[1:21:48] the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ
[1:21:51] and did not have the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:53] Ghost
[1:21:55] that's not a quote off of there that's
[1:21:56] mine a poish didn't have the
[1:22:02] baptism all right we talk about a
[1:22:06] Polish let's
[1:22:07] see
[1:22:10] 365 all right pull up the next one
[1:22:13] really that's 367 this is continuation
[1:22:17] reading in questions and answers okay
[1:22:20] 1957 now watch apoll through the word
[1:22:22] was proving by the word
[1:22:25] faith comes by hearing hearing of the
[1:22:26] word he that heareth my word and
[1:22:29] believeth on him that sent me has
[1:22:30] everlasting life get it apoll by the
[1:22:32] word was Prov it and these were
[1:22:35] Christians they were followers
[1:22:39] disciples if you remember something ke
[1:22:42] going there and brother dick and I used
[1:22:43] to talk about this they were disciples
[1:22:45] until the day of Pentecost then they
[1:22:46] were
[1:22:48] Apostles that's the difference because
[1:22:50] one time he didn't have it the other
[1:22:51] time he was possessed and Pa was Pro my
[1:22:53] the word that Jesus of Christ and they
[1:22:55] had great joy receive the word yet
[1:22:57] knowing only the baptism of John Paul
[1:22:59] passed through the upper coast of
[1:23:00] Ephesus he finds these disciples he said
[1:23:03] have you received the Holy Ghost you
[1:23:05] have believe see now when you believe
[1:23:07] Jesus said you have eternal
[1:23:10] life that's the new birth that's your
[1:23:13] conversion changing but the baptism of
[1:23:15] the Holy Ghost is the power of God that
[1:23:17] you're baptized into and are subject to
[1:23:19] these nine spiritual gifts to work
[1:23:21] through you such as preaching
[1:23:23] Evangelical
[1:23:25] Apostles pastors prophets and all the
[1:23:28] gifts of the body come into this when
[1:23:31] you you're baptized into this body and
[1:23:34] remember brother said preacher don't
[1:23:35] have a right to preach unless you got
[1:23:36] the baptism
[1:23:39] ghost and that doesn't that doesn't make
[1:23:42] you any more a
[1:23:43] Christian it just sets you positionally
[1:23:46] in a place to be a ministering spirit in
[1:23:48] the Church of the Living God now you get
[1:23:53] it going down to the next
[1:23:55] one and they asked him a
[1:23:58] question this is continuation of reading
[1:24:01] okay at that time we see the new birth
[1:24:04] that just Tak place is that when
[1:24:08] okay wrong with the
[1:24:10] computer the computer got
[1:24:13] computed okay I can read it from up here
[1:24:15] let get it back up where we
[1:24:18] at
[1:24:21] okay I'll read from here he said that's
[1:24:25] what they want to know words they said
[1:24:26] at the time you receive the new birth
[1:24:28] this takes place is that because they
[1:24:30] just the question was by one Spirit
[1:24:32] we're all baptized into one body that's
[1:24:34] correct 1 Corinthians 12 would give the
[1:24:36] answer to that all right at that time we
[1:24:39] receive the new birth this takes place
[1:24:41] is that when now that's what they want
[1:24:44] to know yes by one Spirit no no by one
[1:24:49] Spirit we're all baptized into one body
[1:24:52] see that isn't when the new birth begin
[1:24:55] begins I love that
[1:24:57] one the new birth begins when you
[1:25:00] believe on the Lord
[1:25:04] Jesus the new birth begins when you
[1:25:06] believe on the Lord
[1:25:08] Jesus n n there is not one thing listen
[1:25:13] what can you do besides believe what
[1:25:16] more can you do what can you do about it
[1:25:19] anymore what can you do about it anymore
[1:25:22] than just believe it tell me one thing
[1:25:24] thing you can do there's not one thing
[1:25:26] you you can do outside of believing now
[1:25:30] if anything prove comes outside of your
[1:25:32] believing it isn't an act of it isn't an
[1:25:36] act of your own it's an act of God okay
[1:25:39] and he finishes up down on the
[1:25:41] bottom I guess we're on it because
[1:25:44] that's
[1:25:46] 373 come on down and this just said it
[1:25:48] at the bottom the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:50] Ghost is a different act from the new
[1:25:53] birth
[1:25:58] one is a birth one is a baptism one
[1:26:01] brings you eternal life other one gives
[1:26:03] you power gives power into eternal life
[1:26:06] so see to operate now you got it okay
[1:26:09] all
[1:26:10] right sounds confused he done
[1:26:16] it
[1:26:20] okay they can pull this up they want to
[1:26:23] and start off the number
[1:26:25] nine and then all just SC across it try
[1:26:29] to save a little bit of
[1:26:31] time the Pentecostal message was the
[1:26:33] last message with justification
[1:26:35] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:37] Ghost the last three messages of the
[1:26:39] last three messages the life Street
[1:26:41] Church ages forms a complete birth he's
[1:26:44] talking about just like a woman when
[1:26:46] they kill Jesus At The Cross the
[1:26:48] substance come from his body to make up
[1:26:51] the new to make up the the the
[1:26:55] birth they struck his sight blood and
[1:26:57] water came out and what blood and water
[1:27:00] two of
[1:27:01] them and into thy hands I Comm in my
[1:27:03] spirit
[1:27:05] three what came from his body was water
[1:27:08] blood
[1:27:09] spirit right that's what it took to make
[1:27:12] it what a blood and spirit it was in his
[1:27:16] body that would constitute that next one
[1:27:18] see not there with a Shu paragraph
[1:27:21] 48 there is also three in perfection
[1:27:24] of the steps of Grace to the church
[1:27:26] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:27:28] the Holy Ghost that consists of the new
[1:27:30] birth just like a natural birth is typed
[1:27:33] by it which a woman giving birth to a
[1:27:36] child first think un water blood life
[1:27:39] okay demonology
[1:27:42] 53 jumping from 65 backward to show he's
[1:27:45] teaching the same thing 53
[1:27:49] demonology
[1:27:52] 1112 E8
[1:27:55] or instance like this when Jesus died at
[1:27:57] Calvary now me what elements come from
[1:27:59] his body water blood and spirit is that
[1:28:01] right now any Minister any believer
[1:28:04] knows that that's what constitutes the
[1:28:06] new birth is that right that constitutes
[1:28:10] the new birth St John 7:5 there are
[1:28:12] three that by record of water blood and
[1:28:16] spirit and they pierc hiside water and
[1:28:18] blood came out he said into thy hands I
[1:28:21] commend my spirit those elements went
[1:28:23] from his body and it takes those same
[1:28:26] elements to bring you to his you to his
[1:28:28] body that constitutes the new birth he
[1:28:32] goes on to what constitutes the natural
[1:28:33] birth getting these out of the way where
[1:28:35] we can just say it look at the last one
[1:28:39] um Jehovah G
[1:28:42] 1961
[1:28:44] 312 e58 and so is the church in Christ
[1:28:49] God never said just go make any
[1:28:51] organization call it so and so go
[1:28:54] educate them this he took his own son
[1:28:57] and from his heart three elements come
[1:28:59] from his body excuse me sister I want to
[1:29:02] make a point in a natural birth what is
[1:29:04] the first thing happens in a normal
[1:29:05] birth water next blood what is next life
[1:29:09] that's the same thing that constitutes
[1:29:11] the new birth what was the thing come
[1:29:14] out of Jesus's side water blood and in
[1:29:18] thy hands I commend my spirit St John or
[1:29:20] 1 John 5:7 there are three that by
[1:29:23] record in heav heav the Father the word
[1:29:26] which was the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:29:28] these three are one you can't have the
[1:29:30] father without having a son you can't
[1:29:32] have the son without having the Holy
[1:29:34] Ghost these three are one amen all right
[1:29:38] get the quotes out of the way we started
[1:29:41] up on one end of it come all the way
[1:29:42] through
[1:29:43] it sound like odd
[1:29:46] quotes R said you New Birth begins when
[1:29:49] you believe
[1:29:56] justification is when you
[1:30:02] believe he says you have eternal
[1:30:06] life
[1:30:09] okay like the prophet says you die right
[1:30:12] there if Judas isar had have died the
[1:30:15] time that he believed the Lord
[1:30:17] Jesus he would have been all
[1:30:20] right but he lost it
[1:30:24] the prophet of God says you can lose
[1:30:26] your
[1:30:28] salvation but now show me where he ever
[1:30:30] said you can be truly Born
[1:30:32] Again sealed by the Holy Spirit and lose
[1:30:35] your salvation I want to see that
[1:30:40] one I hope this ain't been confusing
[1:30:43] maybe I can finish it in just a
[1:30:46] minute that's why I
[1:30:48] said people think brother rown said this
[1:30:51] and he said that he said this it all
[1:30:53] fits together exactly if you put him in
[1:30:56] order even that the
[1:30:58] disciples had the new
[1:31:01] birth before Jesus Christ
[1:31:05] died even that Apollos who had actually
[1:31:09] not even
[1:31:10] heard of the things to receive the Holy
[1:31:13] Ghost that's
[1:31:15] right those people receive the new
[1:31:20] birth to me it's like Luther
[1:31:24] he received the new
[1:31:26] body by his
[1:31:29] believing the difference was Luther was
[1:31:32] put in the body of
[1:31:34] Christ with eternal life in the
[1:31:38] soul he can say well you're def brother
[1:31:40] around and go ahead cuz you explain it
[1:31:42] I'll turn it over to
[1:31:43] you I'll lay these notes out in front of
[1:31:45] you and let you explain
[1:31:50] it I believe that when you believe on
[1:31:52] the Lord Jesus Christ God wres that down
[1:31:55] As Long as You Keep On Believing
[1:31:57] everything's okay right that's it it'll
[1:31:59] carry you through that's
[1:32:02] right all the way to the baptism of the
[1:32:04] Holy Ghost all the way up the pyramid
[1:32:08] today and all the way into the headstone
[1:32:10] which is love right and all the way to a
[1:32:13] change of a body if you truly believe
[1:32:16] right but if you stop
[1:32:19] believing before you're sealed
[1:32:22] in yeah
[1:32:26] in this day justification don't seal you
[1:32:28] in the body right sanctification don't
[1:32:32] seal you in the
[1:32:34] body you said well brother I just
[1:32:37] saiding that the Holy Ghost is for
[1:32:39] power yeah cuz that's why the scripture
[1:32:43] said after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:32:49] you am I right
[1:32:52] right you shall receive power after the
[1:32:55] Holy Ghost right so the Holy Ghost came
[1:32:58] upon the
[1:32:59] disciples now
[1:33:02] listen and then they receive
[1:33:06] power cuz that's what the scripture
[1:33:08] saying you shall receive power
[1:33:12] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:33:15] after means a period of time there to be
[1:33:22] placed my in seconds but it's still a
[1:33:25] period of
[1:33:27] time they received power they went out
[1:33:31] witnessing we read they went out
[1:33:36] preaching see the new birth today is not
[1:33:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost neither
[1:33:41] the new birth today is not justification
[1:33:43] nor sanctification it is justification
[1:33:46] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:33:48] Holy
[1:33:50] Ghost brings you to a New Birth
[1:33:54] of this
[1:33:55] age as I read to you it completes the
[1:33:57] birth because those ages
[1:34:02] did you believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:34:06] Christ amen kids I want you to do that
[1:34:10] adults I want you to do that you that
[1:34:12] are concerned that's what I want you to
[1:34:13] do I want you to believe on the Lord
[1:34:15] Jesus
[1:34:18] Christ and accept him as your savior
[1:34:20] amen
[1:34:24] then start reading and
[1:34:30] studying ask God to forgive you your
[1:34:32] sins then start believing start reading
[1:34:36] and
[1:34:37] studying and let that word drive that
[1:34:39] unclean Spirit out of
[1:34:43] you and then the Holy Ghost can come in
[1:34:46] amen but if you read the the your future
[1:34:48] home you find brother around said that
[1:34:51] even though you're sanctified
[1:34:54] he said that baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:55] because the scripture calls it baptism
[1:34:58] of the Holy Ghost and Fire that's actual
[1:35:01] scripture and fire right that's not two
[1:35:05] things future homie explains it the fire
[1:35:08] comes before the Holy
[1:35:10] Ghost to burn out everything is left
[1:35:14] that's right what's left me and you
[1:35:17] that's right amen we ain't dead at
[1:35:20] justification we ain't dead at
[1:35:23] sanctification
[1:35:24] amen now is that tying all the messages
[1:35:26] together from the previous series you're
[1:35:29] only dead when you die and or burned
[1:35:32] out to burn out everything in the
[1:35:35] world you mean we'll never have no more
[1:35:38] problem nobody didn't say
[1:35:40] that brother R said when you say that
[1:35:43] and believe it he said Satan going to
[1:35:45] point every gun he's got on you that's
[1:35:47] right so just expect him to do
[1:35:50] it but you don't have to go help him buy
[1:35:53] the guns that's right right you know
[1:35:58] what but you understand what I'm
[1:36:02] saying the new birth in Luther's age was
[1:36:06] justification it only required one stage
[1:36:09] the new birth in Wesley's age was
[1:36:11] sanctification and justification that
[1:36:14] required two stages Pentecostal zeusa
[1:36:16] Street came forth with the
[1:36:20] baptism we see people are so blinded to
[1:36:23] say
[1:36:24] that isusa street was
[1:36:25] false 464 in the seal
[1:36:31] book he said no Messenger to the age
[1:36:35] talking of isusa street he said because
[1:36:37] the Holy Ghost came
[1:36:42] himself in a
[1:36:44] prophet that's not brother
[1:36:47] Brandon then at the end of the age of
[1:36:50] quoting as all the others The Messengers
[1:36:52] will come
[1:36:54] brother around End of the Age right not
[1:36:58] at the beginning of Zeus
[1:37:00] Street you said well I just don't know
[1:37:02] where I'm at you really have got me
[1:37:03] confused good you go
[1:37:06] pray what's the man talking
[1:37:09] about I don't have no problem with you
[1:37:11] asking God what am I talking
[1:37:15] about but you say but Brother D all it
[1:37:18] is is just you know it's adoption well
[1:37:21] that's all right but remember you can't
[1:37:26] adopt anything until it's a child
[1:37:29] first
[1:37:31] right you got to be born again you got
[1:37:34] to be a child of God you got to be in
[1:37:36] the body not just believing unto then
[1:37:39] you can start your
[1:37:47] adoption but the scriptures right the
[1:37:49] prophet's right
[1:37:51] amen and God is so honorable and sweet
[1:37:54] to do that for us to put us to the place
[1:37:57] that he knew Luther wouldn't never come
[1:37:58] on no further he knew Wesley couldn't
[1:38:00] come any further he knew isusa Street
[1:38:02] couldn't come any further amen he knew
[1:38:05] you and I couldn't come any further
[1:38:07] until he sent us a
[1:38:12] prophet what a wonderful day that we
[1:38:14] have that you shall know the truth right
[1:38:17] and the truth shall set you free that's
[1:38:19] right you believe unto eternal life
[1:38:26] but when you receive that genuine
[1:38:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost which is
[1:38:29] justification Sanic baptism of the Holy
[1:38:31] Ghost you now have eternal life you're
[1:38:35] not believing unto amen you have eternal
[1:38:39] life in the soul what we need is eternal
[1:38:42] life in these bodies right right and
[1:38:45] that's the work of the Holy Spirit to
[1:38:47] come in our day are the stages to be
[1:38:51] done the future home
[1:38:54] but just remember the prophet said I
[1:38:56] never
[1:38:57] change from a boy he said I taught three
[1:39:03] processes well then when it sounds like
[1:39:06] he was teaching other
[1:39:08] processes those processes must fit
[1:39:11] into what he was teaching
[1:39:14] on the future
[1:39:17] home believing unto salvation is
[1:39:20] wonderful
[1:39:25] but you're not in the body of
[1:39:27] Christ until you receive that new birth
[1:39:31] of justification sanctification baptism
[1:39:33] of the Holy Ghost and put you in the
[1:39:35] body of
[1:39:37] Christ cuz that's the age of we
[1:39:39] living cuz those disciples couldn't come
[1:39:42] into the body of Christ until Jesus
[1:39:43] Christ died gave his life and then when
[1:39:47] the life came back upon them they were
[1:39:49] confessing him as their savior they were
[1:39:51] Sanctified right and the prophet said
[1:39:53] they had eternal life that's
[1:39:56] fine but you better believe and listen
[1:39:58] to what I was saying cuz you can take
[1:39:59] what you want to but Judas is carot was
[1:40:01] walking right in that same
[1:40:03] place until he denied the Lord
[1:40:07] Jesus and when he denied him he went
[1:40:09] back the other way because the unclean
[1:40:11] Spirit came back into
[1:40:13] Judas right sure
[1:40:17] did that was what caused him to not read
[1:40:19] your Bible he said he was in the upper
[1:40:21] room read the Bible if you want to turn
[1:40:22] to it read it he said that the Spirit
[1:40:25] came in Judas right and he went out
[1:40:28] that's
[1:40:29] right the devil entered into him amen
[1:40:33] that's right did it was nothing wrong
[1:40:35] with Judas right until he let the devil
[1:40:38] come back right right Jesus had drove
[1:40:41] that devil out of him right by the word
[1:40:44] amen but he let it come back right when
[1:40:48] he did he just he denied the Lord
[1:40:52] Jesus Mr just don't get in that place
[1:40:54] and let that happen to you and I because
[1:40:56] of some thought or concept that we
[1:40:59] have did we let that unclean Spirit come
[1:41:02] back into us and remember the whole
[1:41:04] thing was it'll be
[1:41:06] religious and we'll still think we're
[1:41:08] Christians and we'll still be doing
[1:41:09] things and you can still be casting out
[1:41:12] devils and Healing The Sick Lord says
[1:41:15] and already
[1:41:16] lost cuz when they come to him they said
[1:41:19] what we done these things he said depart
[1:41:21] from me I never knew you exactly
[1:41:25] right none of you didn't know them he
[1:41:28] never had an experience of Salvation in
[1:41:30] their
[1:41:31] soul right they had to be out toing amen
[1:41:35] what is the new word Brother D
[1:41:37] justification sanctification and the
[1:41:40] baptism of the Holy
[1:41:42] Ghost and then we would do somebody is
[1:41:45] going to complete all things and walk
[1:41:48] right into a change of the body right
[1:41:51] and walk off this Earth then the world
[1:41:53] world can follow it do you realize that
[1:41:55] you know see you get started and you
[1:41:56] hard to quit come on brother you realize
[1:41:59] that we must go through justification
[1:42:02] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:03] to be in the body then we must go
[1:42:05] through the stages of the seals and the
[1:42:07] opening of the word the mysteries of
[1:42:09] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:42:11] of Holy Ghost until these bodies are
[1:42:12] changed and you know when these bodies
[1:42:15] are changed the world has got to follow
[1:42:19] us it's got to go into eternal life amen
[1:42:23] why because we come out of
[1:42:26] it it's going to follow us thank you
[1:42:29] Jesus listen to what I've said over and
[1:42:33] over I know I leave loopholes and what
[1:42:35] hours to preach 40 something years I've
[1:42:38] been preaching
[1:42:39] it with a new
[1:42:42] birth I like what the prophet said he
[1:42:44] said that new birth begin when you
[1:42:49] believe just keep home believing
[1:42:54] they said all Abraham could do was
[1:42:57] believe he said that's exactly
[1:42:59] right we read there about it not about
[1:43:03] Abraham but he said that's exactly right
[1:43:05] he said all you can do is believe but he
[1:43:07] said what did God do for
[1:43:11] Abraham did God accepted
[1:43:14] amen he'll accept you and I and give us
[1:43:16] a baptism of the Holy Ghost then he can
[1:43:18] say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:43:20] pleased to
[1:43:21] dwell and it'll come out to the bases of
[1:43:24] what hear you
[1:43:26] him it'll be finished what do we got for

[1:55:02] know doing this to tr TR this and you
[1:55:05] just write it down you know about your
[1:55:08] experience or whatever you want and I'll
[1:55:09] be glad to read it but just try to tell
[1:55:12] you what the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:15] is
[1:55:17] right you said when I shouted well
[1:55:19] that's CZ you talking those things you
[1:55:22] he was around somebody else that done
[1:55:23] those
[1:55:24] things what if you done that and didn't
[1:55:26] get it the prophet said spoke in tongues
[1:55:29] he said didn't get it what is the you
[1:55:36] birn see what is
[1:55:40] it what about the man that I was telling
[1:55:43] the sister that picked up a card and
[1:55:45] read it where will you spend
[1:55:48] eternity he went from there to all of
[1:55:51] the great evangelist getting to pray for
[1:55:52] him to receive the New
[1:55:56] Birth when he come to the Prophet The
[1:55:58] Prophet looked at him and
[1:56:00] said I there when you turned
[1:56:03] around he didn't say that right there
[1:56:05] that he was just shattered with the Holy
[1:56:07] Ghost and feel in the body into he said
[1:56:09] right
[1:56:11] there he said you mean I've had it all
[1:56:16] along you see we've been taught that
[1:56:19] you've got to have some form right
[1:56:22] brother Brown said the mystery in the
[1:56:24] end time was to receive the baptism of
[1:56:26] the Holy Ghost without a
[1:56:29] sensation now he did not
[1:56:32] say without an
[1:56:35] experience he said without a
[1:56:38] sensation that's why everybody can be
[1:56:40] different part but I believe the new
[1:56:41] birth and everybody is the
[1:56:43] same I don't know what you done that's
[1:56:46] up to you you may shouted cried seen
[1:56:49] Vision but it's all One new
[1:56:55] birth so it can't be all of these things
[1:56:58] that everybody's taught it reason I
[1:57:00] saying that because brother Tom that
[1:57:04] preached Mercy the other day he may be
[1:57:06] preaching Wednesday I'm not certain cuz
[1:57:08] he's coming back through so maybe if not
[1:57:10] then I'll take this up Wednesday we'll
[1:57:11] do it but you know he's coming back
[1:57:13] through from up North Canada and coming
[1:57:15] back in Tuesday so you know we may be
[1:57:19] having that Wednesday so let's be left
[1:57:20] up to whatever okay
[1:57:23] all M's clear can I say something yeah
[1:57:26] go
[1:57:27] ahead I tell you you know a lot of
[1:57:30] people say well you're negative and what
[1:57:32] have like it had a brother tell me the
[1:57:34] other day how you knew you had the
[1:57:36] baptism Holy
[1:57:38] Ghost he says you lay hands on the sick
[1:57:40] and they're healed you cast out L and
[1:57:43] the scripture come to my
[1:57:45] mind Lord Lord we cast out demons in
[1:57:48] your name we done these money wonderful
[1:57:50] works in your name see and to me when
[1:57:54] things like that happens that's evidence
[1:57:56] that something's taking
[1:57:58] place and you can have two things you
[1:58:01] can have a baptism of holy ghost or you
[1:58:03] can have an anointing and you got to
[1:58:06] tell the difference between the two
[1:58:08] exactly and I think today that chrisan
[1:58:12] as far as I know it the majority is an
[1:58:15] an
[1:58:17] only because that's what it's been
[1:58:19] taught right it's been taught you got to
[1:58:22] do this got to do
[1:58:25] that but why can't we just accept What
[1:58:27] God
[1:58:28] Says anybody else before we
[1:58:33] go de Heavenly Father we thank you for
[1:58:36] this day in your love unto us thank you
[1:58:38] for your word and I pray that what I've
[1:58:40] said has been worthy of being said I
[1:58:43] tried the best I could do in the human
[1:58:46] realm Lord to speak about the things cuz
[1:58:50] it's just telling about my own life want
[1:58:52] to
[1:58:54] believe and Lord
[1:58:56] truly we can believe on you before you
[1:58:59] come and accept us cuz we have to do
[1:59:02] that it's not a choice we have to accept
[1:59:05] you first and then you can accept us we
[1:59:08] ask you to just help us give us
[1:59:10] understanding ears that we may hear give
