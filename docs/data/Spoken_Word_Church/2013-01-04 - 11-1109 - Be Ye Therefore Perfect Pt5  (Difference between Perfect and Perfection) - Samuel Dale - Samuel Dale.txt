to us amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn with us to Matthew 5 where we've been reading and Romans 4 Matthew 5 Romans 4 now remember the announcements as we've made them that this coming Sunday Brother David gadman will be here from Alabama to preach for you while we're there in in Oklahoma and in Kansas and then uh Wednesday day which will be the next next Wednesday coming up brother Aon will be taking to service then on Sunday brother uh Richard Douglas will be taking the services on Sunday there for you so back these up with your priers and your presence and everything remember now the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday there brother homers and we won't be able to to go because we'll be leaving Lord willing this coming Friday wait and I to to go out to uh wiah and to Oklahoma we'll be hunting but be preaching so we'll be tied up you can click on the internet and watch us and we'll if we get an opportunity we'll try to click on to you so that's the best we can tell you but just remember this and do amen remember a little Abby she's sick today and so just remember her she's got a thing that's going around and I think the technical way they call it was the hoof and mouth disease so it wasn't the old days of it but it's it's from hand and mouth and and things and it's just a apart so she didn't choose to come tonight and know but that's you know just pray to the Lord she's okay with running just a little mild temperature and but just pray that everything will be all right amen amen so let's go into the scriptures and then we'll pray and uh just take on these things I've been trying for a while to get something to you and maybe tonight we will just I really didn't have anything written down or quotes or anything just something laying here and there and and so we'll just try to go to the best way we can tonight to see what we can talk about from this scripture but let's pray Lord Jesus we thank you Father for the day and the hour that we have upon the Earth we thank you for your love and your grace and to us thank you for salvation thank you for peace thank you for all things thank you for being you cuz that way we can depend upon it and you don't change so then we don't have to worry we can just rest in you we love you and we thank you you bless those that are sick remember Little abig Grace there Lord and take away that problem remember all of us here together and Lord the sickness is among us because you said in your word that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction and Lord we love you and we thank you have your way tonight in the service bless and guide each one in Jesus name amen let's go to Matthew 5 we've been reading from verse 37 through 48 then we'll go to Romans 4 let your communication be yay yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil and whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man was Will soe thee at the law and take away thy Coke let him have thy cloak also now that's remember the background the Beatitudes be your attitude now the Lord Jesus is showing how his attitude of the way he is so that's what he expects us to do to have in this see that would be the be attitudes to you and I you know be our attitude in other words be it to the right place and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him Twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would Bor of Thee turn not thou away you have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute not that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and send us reain on the just and the unjust that we may be the children of God that we may be able to do like God does right right now cuz this is what it's describing for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the saint and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the public and so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect all right now we go over to Romans 4 and we'll begin reading verse one to get the point what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh had found now watch for If Abraham were justified by works he ha where of to Glory but not before God okay plain language right for what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was in it was counted unto him for righteous and to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt see if he worked for it there something he could do it wouldn't be Grace see right it would be some reward but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifi the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works saying bless are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin amen you may be seated Lord that his Blessing to the reading of the word now what about a man we want to just go back and try to use that in David well that would be even greater than try to using it in the New Testament part but what about a man that God will not impute sin impute means to reckon or count you know us to establish against him all right you say well now that's impossible I agree with you that's the one thing I want tonight to to try to express to you where that you can say well this is what brother Dale believes and that way then you won't be saying what does he believe right you know cuz we used we came up through the Baptist and I'm not throwing off on them just because we came there but they'd preach one service be you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and they'd have you you know feeling good maybe and I'm just making the point of it maybe the next service or so down the road they would preach there's none good no not one and they condemn everybody so you never could get to a right part of trying to have faith because you didn't know what it was they didn't lay it out but now we went through a good many of the services declaring what brother Brown said that when Jesus said in Matthew there 5:48 to be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect that to require that meant that he had to make a way that's right or he would have not required it see then you say well there's none perfect no not one now there's a quote in here in a minute that you'll see brother R said see right now you got a contradiction see that's where people call contradictions where it says None good no not one and then the other say be therefore perfect but see those are not contradictions those are scriptures right once placed in the correct order right we bring a correct understanding all right so then it won't be one fighting the other you know all right but now get to Point see we say but we can't be perfect I agree with you there's no way than any human mortal I don't care where it's brother brandom or who you want to talk about right no human mortal outside of the Lord Jesus Christ could qualify in any form to be talking about being perfect right I agree with you right all right but then I've got to go on the opposite side of it and say I don't agree with you right and even go on to the point now that the human element we're dealing with Body Spirit and soul right right a person can be perfectly totally sinless right and then still turn around and be like brother brandham and says brother brandham do you sin he said every day right now that's what I said we need to Define sin a lot of times because people get all involved involved in the definitions of words but now did Brother R say he disbelieved the word he said show me where I've ever disbelieved right right well then he's not talking about the word sin which means unbelief of disbelieving the word he's talking about the same thing if we have time to get back to it that Paul gets into Romans about the 7eventh chapter and that's where he's expressing that the things I would I do not the things I do I would not in this backwards and forth he said well then with one said I serve the law of Faith that's from the inward man all right but said in the Natural Life out here I saw serve the law of the flesh which means what now that doesn't mean that well with my flesh I can't help it so I just got to commit adultery every once in a while you know now he's not talking about junk I'll be glad to show you where brother R Expresses in conduct order and doctrine that he was talking about natural everyday life not sinful things PA wouldn't say I just can't Happ it you know I just have to lust cuz I'm in this body no he was talking about natural things he said even to the basis of of uh I'm too tired to go to church church he said then I let my body rule over my going and said I don't go MBE like I've always told you you let that old body rule you you said well I'm so tired till I just can't go and the devil said that's right you tired you're wore out just take a day off you know don't go to church well about the time that the service starts here the devil's going to change his tactic and he's going to say I told you you wouldn't a Christian cuz if you would you would have went that's right right so you'll never win with him you might as well get up and go on and forget it or either go to bed and go to sleep you know cuz you're never going to win over the Devil he's going to have a trick either way the way you go all right but now we covered the life message where brother randam said said we're either perfect or we're lost you remember the quote he said you're either perfect or you're lost right he said there's no middle area no black white bird no siner saint no drunk and sober man right won't work all right he says if we're not perfect we can't go to heaven right so now we might to get away from our old Theology of n good no not one you think you're perfect and I told you then they come up with the idea and I saw the bumper sticker and said I'm not perfect I'm just forgiven yeah well if you're forgiven then according to God he don't remember it how much more perfect would you want than the fact that a God can can be to the basis that he can forget right right amen right don't ask me how he does it not I can't and you can't right I remember everything I done just about it in life right but God can't remember any of it that I put under the B when are we going to get down to believing it like that and accepting What God Says for us that's right I gave you or two three services covered in the Old Testament where Noah was a perfect man or job was a perfect man that's what God said about him well if God said he's perfect then who am I to try to bring up something about him that's right right right see I'm trying to bring something out of them under the blood that's been put under the blood right and you know what you happen there don't you in other words I try to draw something out under the blood that br brother Don's put under the blood you know what happened that thing will come to me oh no yes it will MH it'll come and try to get you cuz you brought it out under the blood God put it there and says it's gone see we try to bring it up but be careful what you trying to bring up against somebody it's like I told you I'm so glad brother random explained where it says are in the scripture return since you went over to sa for the destruction of the flesh that the soul might be saved see we used to think that the church had the power to just take a guy you know and just just turn him over well I found out that brother brownon said we turn him over to God he turns them over to the devil all right now see that's wonderful you might not think it is but it is for me because I'm Pastor I have to call a situation sometime and see what if I'm over here condemning brother klie and we're turning him loose and he's over at his house praying for all of us and don't ask God to forgive him what he donees now who's going to get in trouble God don't play games right so we turned him we'd have to we turn him over to God then God would Loos him CU he knows whether or not his heart is right so we're not playing with the word we know what the message of the hour bring right that's right but now what is the thought of being perfect now Noah he probably died a drunk God said he's Perfect Right his kids was out doing all kind of wrong things he made an atonement for him right God gave him his kids and Glory that's right that's Bible but you see what are we talking about being perfect the word perfect we'll get more on this when we get back cuz I'm just laying a background for something to go on in so you can go to Hebrews 6 and start studying on uh you know therefore leaving the principles of God let un principle of Doctrine let us go on to Perfection now that's what I want to ask you tonight so that you'll get a point for later on see in the Bible uh we were talking today and uh you know it's just a a human part and it it was like I was giving the illustration to brother Mark there in the back seat and I said but Martin you know what ovar he looked at and said what I Oar he said you know he didn't understand he's a northern said I said oh okay over there he said yeah he knew what I was saying well I said the same thing before I just said it in southern language Oar let's go oar amen right that's Pig Latin for southerners all right but my point was you can say something but you need an understanding amen that's right all right so when God gave us the ability to you know he knew that we would not have the ability to understand the Greek or the Hebrew Etc you know like that because we wouldn't be those people all right so he gave us a a a people like scof Fields Etc that would go through and uh put a lot of definitions to things right and he would give us people that would give us the lexicons you know that would give us the definitions of wording all right so then the word perfect when we get back you'll get to it and see it more it it's like perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect right so it can have many different meanings to the word perfect they made a perfect sacrifice in the Old Testament the Bible said I mean that's what it says it made a perfect sacrifice well now that was an animal but see it was perfect all right so I'm just asking the question tonight to get a little point and then we'll get back to the thought what's the difference between perfect in Perfection what's the difference between perfect and Perfection now they're both used in the Bible but to get an understanding then see perfect is like a condition that one has reached by some means right by some means it's run you know Perfect all right but perfection has to do with a growth development into the process that you're talking about right so that's what we got to break it down and we'll see then and get away from our human thinking of perfection see we've been taught all of our Liv this is our right hand how do we know they me you're a horse by hands whose hands I wouldn't want to get on a horse but how many hands 16 Hands is tall but what if you had a horse it was 16 Hands of brother Arline the suer be 20t tall see we we we label things by what words we use all right and so then when God gave us the language we have he gave us an ability to look up these things to be able to get definitions there's a lot of words in the Bible that when I begin to try to read the Bible I didn't have enough education still don't have enough education to understand what those words mean you know what I look them up the dictionary even some in the straight King James version I look have to look up definitions of things well because that's the way you find out what it is you said well I know what that word means well it might not mean that in that order you remember the way that I bring it the before and the after part of it will Express what it's about so go backward and read a little bit and go forward and read a little bit and you'll see better what the definition is all right but how can a human mortal think of being perfect but yet Jesus said unless our righteousness EX ceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees that will not enter Heaven now the scribes might have had problems because they wouldn't in that close form but the Pharisees if they had a problem they had a problem you know even the high priest one Mark against him he could be killed what do you want to try to compare with their lives that's what Paul was explaining in Romans the things I do and the things I do not whatever you know I'm Waring Within Myself and he couldn't see until he seen Christ so now being perfect so we admit right openly that there's none of us perfect right right there's not a human being in the world world that is perfect cuz here's what the prophet would say Hebrew Book he said I hate to think that I had to go to heaven on the Merit of myself watch now listen he said even if I was born five minutes ago right that's right you remember that now what can a five minute old baby do nothing it can't sin but you know what it's a product of sin right it come by sexi right a product of sin the psalmist David summed it up by saying born in sin shapen in iniquity come from my mother's wound to Li her you don't have to teach a baby how to lie you got to teach it how to tell the truth right it'll automatically learn how to lie you see then what would they be that we could think about being perfect right and that's what the whole book of Job I wish you'd read that over and over and over of the Book of Job and those three men came to him and told him said now job look at you you've lost your family You' lost all your cows and your your donkeys and your C and all the things you had you've lost everything you got said you're sitting out there now scraping your balls you know Rising balls with a piece of pottery did you know you done wrong now confess up but he kept telling me I done what God told me to do that's right right he told me to offer the sacrifice I've offered the sacrifice so thereby according to what God says I have no sin in my life right right now he wasn't saying that he didn't have a bad thought come on right he wasn't saying that he didn't maybe you know have little problems in life he was saying he done what God told told him to do right right God told Abraham remember there in the scripture said walk before me and be thy perfect now what could Abraham do we read over here in Romans that he couldn't rely upon the things he had done or not done or whatever he was he could not rely upon that that's what I was trying to get you to see there the the Sunday I guess it was that the great Apostle Paul so the Pharisee the Pharisees concerning the law blameless he said that's right but he said I found that that I thought was life I found it to be death right why because he thought like job like Noah like all the others back there the best they could think was I've done what God told me yeah right so I I've got to be right in the world cuz God covered him but when job seen the Redeemer that's right coming then he seen the one that would stand between that's right amen he said I'm covered of God there's a covered over me said oh I would just paraphrasing him I would that somebody would come and just take my hand and hold God's hand and bring us together yes amen he longed for that cuz he seen something about himself wasn't right right but when that would come you know he said I know my redeemer liveth he saw the coming of the Messiah he saw the one that would take away all of his problems that's right but no matter if they were covered by the blood they could not enter in to eternal life under those situations right right because eternal life was not there it had to come in a man one day to walk upon the Earth and he had to give his life for us to be able to receive eternal life but if God looked at them back there and called him perfect cuz he done what he said all right then how much more would he look at us through the blood of Jesus Christ right and the blood of Jesus Christ covers the whole world today there's no sinner in the presence of God he got to kill it think about it so the blood of Jesus Christ covered the world as well as the blood of bulls and goats had it covered in an example right all right and in doing that it brings us as to human beings that as far as the inward part of us which is the New Birth the soul you're born again you have eternal life that soul is as perfect and pure and eternal if you have eternal life if you've accepted Jesus Christ and he's accepted you and gave you the new birth you have eternal life now if you've done it through the head that that won't work if it's really a possession now right I'm not talking about everybody comes to the alar and said I want to be saved right you remember I was trying to express that by the Old Testament people that resurrected it said many of the old didn't say all of them right there was some reason that all of them didn't come up but now to look at it then end the soul is perfect by the new birth but we're still living in this body Paul calls it there in Romans this body of death right he calls it that in the the 8th chapter no seventh chapter I think it's verse yes seventh chapter who can deliver me from this body of death he knew he had a problem with the body right don't be like the Baptist used to be cuz that's the way they preached it they said Paul was writing his life chapter 1 2 3 4 5 6 that he was writing his life of trying to be saved in chapter 7 he comes to more or less a position or place of being able to be saved in chapter uh chapter 7even chapter 8 there is therefore now no condemnation them that are in Christ Jesus verse one all right see that's the way the B has preached it but I don't believe that I believe Paul was explaining chapter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and all of that his life in Christ right so he saying who can deliver me from this body he said I I want to be of the out Resurrection you remember that in scripture right now why would he want to be out Resurrection he knew he had the resurrection inside of him he he explained it by the new birth but he wanted an out Resurrection out from the unbelief really he wanted to change of the body just put it in plain language he wanted this body redeemed and he realized as long as he was in this body he was having trouble now watch it according to the law of blindess all right then he says I find out this thing is killing me he never recognized his little parts of his life that was human of a wrong thought CU remember under the Old Testament wrong thought wouldn't wouldn't I mean you could lust all you wanted to in the Old Testament that was no law that they kill you right but you going to do it to kill you right the the difference in the two Jesus come to magnify right Jesus said you know we read there if you if you look on a woman we didn't read it but we you look on a woman to lust after you committed adultery right all right he magnified it right he Amplified it he brought it up into a higher order so Paul then sees now look at the situation I know I'm caral but listen look at the situation of the Apostle Paul in his Old Situation under the law he walk around I'm blameless I'm blameless I haven't sinned all day I'm happy oh I love the Lord Jehovah God he get saved and don't you believe he got saved don't you believe he got the new birth then he's going around and saying who can deliver me from this body of sin looks backward right he comes from a happy state to a condemned state right that's what amplifying the law does to you amen they wouldn't murder I mean they didn't kill you for lusting in the Old Testament but when Jesus said if you lust after one you committed adultery with her right now to the point I'm trying to get you to see is the Apostle Paul wasn't saying I got to sin so I can't have it no he was saying forgive me for sinning right brother random you see he said every day right he said show me where I'm off the word right so he wasn't disbelieving the word right that could not have been what he was talking about he had to be talking about the little things of Life m amen you know you remember he even showed in the vision about how that they about to turn down to the wall and the things you know and in the vision he was even more he was going to bust that guy and when it come up time to do it the Lord said bypass this you know he knew right quick he wasn't supposed to go out there and get mad at that guy he said what are you doing they said we're going to put a road through here he said there's something in a vision I got to go look you went back looked at Vis and said now I got to go to Arizona I don't know why but I got to go but get what I'm talking about we're all human Mortals so one mortal can't look at the other Mortal and see Perfection right because we're all seeing what we see right but God doesn't look at us like that amen the soul is eternal by the new birth how much more perfect can you make anything than Eternal amen right do you have anything to add to Eternity to make it better I'd like to know about it but I thought Eternal was a state of total Perfection that nothing could ever be added to it right you can't make it better you can't do anything cuz it's perfect all right amen but we as human Mortals have problems in their flesh right right just little bitty things but now watch the scripture it's the little foxes right that spoils the vine right right all right now so we're all I'm talking about newborn people now I'm talking about New Birth that's all I can talk about tonight cuz those that are not born again can't understand what you're talking about see that's why you have people you think you're perfect well there's none good know not one I said but God said I perfect I saw you get upset one ago you ain't perfect you're like joob you're a secret sinner well you might have a good argument if job had been proved to being a secret sin that's right right but he wasn't proved to be a secret sinner that's right agreed right go read your book he wasn't proved that he was a secret sinner the only thing that was brother random even just had to State it because elu when he came to him which was Christ he said you're just a little bit exalted M he was a little bit self-righteous right you know why cuz he thought he's right right but he thought he was right in himself right but when he saw that Redeemer amen he knew there was something else to the story and that's the way it is with you and I right see the new birth brings us a redeemer right makes a soul perfect not complete because that's the word Perfection it's a growth development until we leave here stature of a perfect man whatever you want to call it adding Faith you know therefore leaving the principle of the doctrine Christ let's go into Perfection yeah I don't claim to be perfect in the form of being complete well because I'm not complete what about you we're still here anybody got an argument there we're still sitting here we're getting older we're having problems we're start down the road tonight somebody cut us on what did he do that for he might have cut you off on that part to keep you running into that other guy on the other side of the road but see we don't see it like that do we we just see what he do that to me for like brother Mo used to say he said Devil's mad at me he said I ain't making no joke out of it but it's kind of funny he say devil was mad at me he said my water pipes are busting I said no they ain't brother things getting old wor out like you you know you say well the devil was they a lot of water pip last 50 years but you know I'm just making a point that we look at something and think it's maybe uh I remember one time we were coming from Florida and we miscued the way we're to come around Atlanta and after we got so far my wife said what you going to do I said I'm G to let them go on I'm cutting this way well they went all the way around we went through we got down and got a traffic jam we was late getting home but what if I went the other way and it have been a wreck yeah you don't have think like that do you right maybe sometimes the Lord's taking us through things let's get the point to you but listen so then we EST Lish that's why I said I just wanted to make sure you understand then let's establish one thing that by the new birth it makes our soul Eternal right and and if it's Eternal it would have to be perfect right right all right but we're still in human flesh that we have problems every day right right and the Bible says that anything that's not of faith is sin all right I'm an example of it you eat too much your belly sinfully slides out right and the older I get it's the harder to get it back up where it used to be it used to be up under my chest and I had a big old chest but it doesn't work now all eating too much can be a sin how many of you got high blood pressure I love pork don't you now no better need it like everything so I don't I'll eat some he said well it can be Sanctified you know all right but the same one it said you can sanctify it said just leave that stuff alone you know right we already to think about it but I'm just making a point to you when I'm talking about that we sin as human beings and that we're not perfect in our human flesh I am not talking about that that gives us a right to go out and just live like the devil and then say the devil made me do it I don't agree with that you argue with me about it argue with me I don't agree that the devil makes us do it all the time I think we have a lot to do with it that's right I don't blame him for all the things sure sin in the origal brought it down okay we're all right but if you don't volunteer for it right and we volunteer the Bible said he that sends will life receive the knowledge of the truth th remain is no more sacrifice the prophet said you believe in willfully sin that's right cuz you know better are you lost all right Paul what is it with my inward being he said there in Roman I serve the law of God I'm a Christian I'm born again and before I got to this situation I didn't realize all of these things that I was doing was any problems right that's right but said now they've been magnified right before me until I realize that there's none good no not one there's not anything in US mortal people that's any good it's like I tell all of you you can argue with me all you want to people don't like for me to talk playing you know but you black people you can run your roots to Africa we can't run ours no further back hardly anywhere that's why they call us Caucasian I told you a long time ago they order said Co concoction cuz that's what we are oh don't throw off on me I come from England yes so it the DS but that don't mean I'm right you see we get that righteous indignation I I don't love you thought off on my family I ain't thought off on your family I'm thr off on you that solve the problem get me away from your family I'm talking about you I'm talking about me we're in human life we live in human life we are subject to the things of human life even the Lord Jesus was subject to life right he had to eat he had to sleep he had to do things back when I was in the Baptist I used to think it was so much God he didn't never he couldn't stomp his toe I give you scripture B said you bur him up unless you dash his foot against the tone i' give you scripture for when the prophet said after he raised that uh child from name there believe was from the dead said according to I think word comes from but he said according to that he said Jesus sat on a rock grown with a headache that's right but you see I'm not like these people now that said Jesus was done wrong I didn't say that so now don't go the wrong way with me amen he was God in human flesh but yet he was a mortal right which mean he was subject to life right he got angry one day right you agree planted a rope together planned it in other words didn't just reach over and get a whip he platted the ropes together he got on I'm going to go out there and run them out of his P you know that's what he done that's right but like I've always tried to tell you we might run somebody out out of the building but are we willing to go to the cross and die for them that's it it that's my point right sinless Perfection there's no such thing there's no such thing as sinless Perfection now watch my point in the New Birth by the new birth in your soul is sinless perfection amen you see what I'm talking about in your new birth is sinless perfection but there mortal beings out here in this life that we live the best we could do would never be sinless Perfection right that's right he say yes no it's not sinless Perfection it's covered I don't you know I'll give you a quote a minute where brother Brown said it it's a not what you've done is not even what you do so be careful now what you're doing but just don't go overboard that's the point I want to make to you tonight we're talking about eternal life in the soul to make the soul Eternal but we're talking about human mortal bodies that live under the curse of sin amen right you wouldn't have babies born if you didn't have lust right come on you understand what I'm saying so we're living in a situation to where that we need something to work on his body right am that's why I've always tried to get you to see that brother Brown's message come to explain eternal life for Body Spirit Soul world everything amen we didn't need a message of eternal life for the soul the Bible is already full of it with the apostles amen but we needed somebody to turn us back to help us to see that amen right but everybody was looking for a new body you see the reason they was looking for a new body they were honest enough to admit that this body is not no good right but see the people of the message gets the idea that well bless God I don't see him anyway what are you doing it for like I told you about that lady told Jack Co had SE in that many years or something he said let sit down and shut up you're the biggest liar here well it's time to say things like that people say so I tell you what I always was eternal you can't condemn me that's why they go off and have extra women and young girls and all kind of things in this message that I don't like to be associated with it amen but we are because of life but there's plenty of them that that take out these little young girls and live with them cuz they preached that they're their husband and they're doing no more the Catholic church was what they was doing right claiming the message claiming brother Rand said it was all right and being that's the biggest hypocrite in the world right they have their day they ain't worried about it amen but I'm just trying to express in human terminologies that in Soul you can be perfectly Tau totally sinless but living in a body that's subject to the world that told you over and over I say it one more time that don't give us no right to go out and say it don't matter what I do I'm going to heaven you got that idea you're not even born again is that plain enough bless God I you didn't say I know I didn't say you but I like what the man said about you know one of the great evangelists down to there and this old drunk was staggering by and this other evangelist talk to him said that's one of your converts he said looks like something i' convert he sure didn't say it was God's convert right but when we living like that you see Church don't ever get to the point that we think that it doesn't matter what we do in these bodies cuz it does matter that's where I've tried to explain to you there are two judgments in the Bible one is the white Throne judgment we do not go before that white Throne judgment we sit on the white Throne judgment with him judging the world and even judging Angels etc etc but there is a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad and if we don't get rid of them while we're here we're going to have to answer that right right and you said well bless joh I just wait till I get there you know what that proves you lost show me where the holy spirit inside of you could allow you to go out and live in adultery and not condemn you well it don't condemn me to smoke well you don't have anything to condemn you don't condemn me to drink you don't condemn me to do it when you don't have anything to condemn a hog acts like a hog right that's his nature but you take the nature out of the hog and you put a nature of a lamb in the hog what have you got he's going to act like a lamb we're supposed to be Christians right think people with enough temper to fight a bu all they say I'm a Christian I'm Christian well I can two brothers were saying that night in a Minister's meeting was having they was talking about how that that you know said you know it's it's it's not me mad said it's just my right indignation you know this other brother got up behind him and said I don't know how y'all feel about it but said when I act like that I'm mad you know and that's what we ought to do is face ourselves right you know when you look in the mirror there's been more muscles strin looking in mirrors than they have about weightlifting right you stand there and boy you look pretty you don't see all them wrinkles all that gray ha all that bald head old fat tummy hanging out we think we're pretty right what you pring for a boy that's what you do every morning you get up we think we're pretty you know but listen Church defining words is what I'm trying to do when the prophet said I sin daily I don't believe he was saying I disbelieve the word but yet he will finalize sin by saying there's just one sin right and that's the sin of unbelief but see Life Is Life we live in life we we are here we're under the curse and until the change comes we will have trouble with these bodies right right see if you ever get to Point thinking in your mind well it don't matter what I do you already to know that ain't God that's not God telling you it's all right to do those things right amen right when I got B with that that's what he thought that's right God was right he said today you eat she died less than a th Years cuz one day is a th000 years she died less than a th years God was still right but she didn't think it she thought she got B ined she lived 900 something years she thought she got by with it but God's word was still right am see we still is I trying to explain the other day we still have to have the Bible says an advocate Paul says which is one who stands between bless God I'm so perfect I don't need nobody stand between me and God I stand myself I'll remind you who was it that that had the dream or whatever it was I think his name in a minute and he he went to heaven and he said while he was there in the presence of that light he thought I never have done wrong I never Li he said then all these little things came up to where it wasn't exactly right right I never stole anything he said all these things came up that wasn't exactly right well brother D I mean I've had people argue me with this they said will the Lord forgive me see one brother tried to preach here and I told him it wouldn't right some pull pip here he tried to preach did you get the new birth that covered you marriage and divorce I told him I didn't agree with that cuz one would WR around have to preach the grace of it you said well now maybe he meant all right maybe he meant I don't know but he sure didn't explain it that's right maybe he meant the completion of the new birth would set everything free that's right but we can have the new birth and we need the grace of marriage and divorce amen yes sir CU you can't accept the grace of marriage and divorce unless you got the new birth first right that's right tell me how you can do it the prophet said it's a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals right I was looking at another scripture in there tonight and you know there some things I'll probably speak on that Oklahoma but I remembered this scripture but I didn't bring it out when when I was in the point of talking about Moses in Exodus 32 but in numbers uh 14 verse 19 Moses said pardon I beseech Thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy as thou H has forgiven this people from Egypt until e even until now and the Lord said I have pardoned according to Thy word that was Christ not Moses Christ that tell could tell God a better way of doing something Moses never gloried in the fact that he thought he wasn't guilty Abraham didn't need you right if you're a human mortal with the baptism of the Holy Ghost take my word for it you'll never you you'll never get to the basis that you don't realize what's wrong in your life right if you ever think you do number one you need an order right cuz you're not born again right that's what Paul's explaining the things I do I would not the things I do would not I do and all but it's not me it's this law sin of My Flesh but the inward man is pure by the new birth does everybody understand what I'm saying whether you agree with me or not right that's up to you between God and you to reveal it I believe that every person that is ever born again is absolutely totally sinless in their soul right right if you're born again amen but this body is still the problem we got troubles with yes sir right and as long as we're in this body we will have troubles with the body that's right but I am not talking about not talking about well I can't help it so I commit adultery every once in a while you're not born again that's right do you understand me any planer can I get right what else can I say that's I don't mean it's wrong but can I put it in a Northern language and say you're wrong or a southern language say you wrong he regardless it comes out to one thing the prophet of God said a Christian will immediately amen when you do wrong repent that's right yes sir you mean to tell me you can go out and do something wrong and and go to pick up your Bible and start to read it and like I said even brother brandom right when that income tax case wasn't he was just so wore out until humanly mortally he was just wanting to get rid of the guys he told his wife he started out the door said tell him I'm not here you know he wasn't in the house but it was a white lie and the white Li is worse than the big lie big lie nobody don't believe white lie some people believe right when he said tell them I'm not here he goes down to pray for a baby right the holy spirit said take your dirty hands off that baby of course most of us would have said bless God lord I pray I'm sorry I repented to you he said you going to make it right that's right he didn't just go back and tell his wife he did but he didn't stop there he them people up and he explained it to them I was just so wor out I didn't want to talk to you said I'm sorry I lied to you and I had my wife to lie you know what the man said I than more of you now it never have you think things it turned out good but then he went back to that baby and he said now bring me the baby and God delivered the child right there you see we don't think about that that we you know we think we get by with it because we do something wrong and like I've always told you and you tell me I'm wrong come on be in my office right well you know what it is I go do something to somebody I go to Dan I do something to Danny you know if I don't get rid of that immediately when that Holy Spirit condemns me tells me I'm wrong you know what'll happen cuz you're a human being right about an hour later I start blaming him for it right right it wasn't my fault he would not even been here if he had been here I wouldn't have said that two hours later first thing you know I blamed him for everything it's all Danny's fault well you know that's going to have to be straightened up somewhere but I don't understand you I don't understand you Brother D you preached it we're perfect and then you preach that we got things we need to confess I'm just telling you what the Bible says and telling you what the prophet said if I'm that far off come and show me but don't come into office with me and start sitting down I don't agree with you you bring your Bible and you bring the prophet's message we'll talk about it I don't have time to play around with silly little ideas I just don't think you're right I think he was upset well if I'm upset that's my problem I have to deal with that I have to go home tonight and live with this sermon it hits me for it hits you but there's people that rather to give you brand new Cadillac and say I'm sorry right that's right right why I can't what you say I'm sorry yes sir but really mean it the prophet said that Holy Spirit Will condemn you immediately get rid of it when the Bible said don't let your sin go down on sun go down on your wrath right then the next day you going to blame the other person don't let it go down I'm sorry that's right that's why I said the wedding I do it it wouldn't matter to me if I was as mad as a hornet my wife before we go to bed tonight I said love you and I mean it I mean it I'm sorry I love you I apologize what I love you but why can't we be that way it is bless God let her say it first then I'll say it now where's the Bible for it just onest where's the Bible for listen according to the Bible and according to the prophet we're human beings and we're going to have trouble in this flesh right all right sometimes we can't help because because we're human because of our life desires things husband wife living that's that's God it doesn't look at that to call it sin it's going to do with the wrong person then you got a problem right see I'm not talking about something to where that it doesn't matter what we do because if we don't confess they will have to be an account given for that act that we done right right well I I thought you meant we' all go it doesn't have anything to do with going to heaven you'll already be in heaven or somewhere when that appears it's not going to keep us out of the Rapture but we have to give an account I tell you one I don't know where I believe that or not that's your choice I thought when I got saved that everything was covered that's as Catholic as anybody can be right I'm not against them right I just use that because that's what they do so we Baptist you know what we have once saved always sa you never heard him preach F was going to heaven because he pav the parking lot painted the church putting new pews in don't anybody go to hell no more you want to do away with it yeah but I'm just trying to be honest straight where you won't misunderstand me then when I do say look there is a man somewhere that the Bible said sin is not imputed unto that man right and you know anything I put under the blood right can't be imputed that's but if I don't put it under the blood somewhere I'm going to ask that's hard to understand I guess the people that are not regenerated right because he can't understand how you can preach Perfection and then preach that you've got to answer for the Deeds Done in the body I didn't write the Bible I just try to tell you what God says why wouldn't we want to be straight why would we want to go out and live like the devil and think that we could go to heaven brother randman explaining that he said say suppose I go overseas he said some woman comes along you know what he's talking about right we mortal a human being some woman comes along you know speaks to him wrong way so he comes home he said I go tell my wife said honey this woman come up he said I believe she'd forgive me but he said how dare could I do that right when she's sitting at home turned gray-headed at 40 years old handling the fires and life and burdened with all kind of things what you what do you women think it would be like living there whenever day you had maniacs and all kind of things hanging on your doors and and all kind of people coming out and you couldn't even have a minute with your husband because he's got to be gone somewhere to pray for somebody he said I dare that I could do something like that he said I wouldn't because I love her we're not talking about a doo granddaddy you know how that is our grandkids they get by with bloody murder when great grandkids coming along doing just the same kids come in and say you didn't let us do that we jumped on the bed we got we didn't want to sit down for a while that's right yeah you know we it's different now yes sir God's not to do your grandaddy he's gone he knows how to raise his children amen that's right and you know what he does a lot of times he gives us a weapon when we need it that's right you know but you know what I love about him he always whips with a nail scarred hand that's right right see Scofield even knew when it says there be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect he says in his footnotes he said it has nothing to do with the fact of sin he said there's a growth development that's right the growth development and we get the older we get in the Christianity you mean to think that we can say we can get by you know what I I hate two things and I'm sorry I'm just human I don't mind telling you I don't like to go to funerals and I don't like to go to hospitals I do I'm just sorry maybe that's why I don't go a lot I went this morning to see brother George for a few minut I had a good time with him his mind still good working good and all they working on him you know he said what in the world am I doing here brother Dale I said well maybe it's CA they need to give you some therapy well I want him to be happy about it you know have condemn somebody and say well put you in here cuz they going to leave you let you die why don't you have to be something like that I said they going to give you therapy they were they would happen it but you don't hate to be there because I see those people with their minds but you know what I think about I think about that person that his mind is slipping you know I don't believe God accounts those thing I know you may believe different I don't know I don't believe God accounts those things when it comes to a place that they don't you know and I look around and I just say thank you Lord that you don't keep up with all this that they're doing but you still do all the things I'm doing forgive me forgive me how many times a day do you ask God to forgive you every time I pray I ask him forgive me Lord you said well you ought to quit doing it I try but I'm a human mortal mhm what would it be what thing could we do if God was to drop down right into our presence if you go to a King brother Brown said I didn't mind it he said they cut my trousers off you know and fixed them and he said I was told never to to turn my back on a king he said I have no problem cuz see that was their way of doing he said I ain't going to kiss his toe or his ring right but he went before you know would have went before the Pope I think something happened he didn't get to go I'm just I'm just saying that off hand I can't remember but anyhow what would it be if you knew that Jesus Christ was going to stand right here tonight ain't a person in this world be able to stand in his principles right cuz we'd be condemned but every soul of ever born again Christian can stand in his presence so until I can get to that place to bring this body to the position let me depend upon the inward part and you know what the only way the outward part is going to ever be worth anything is because of the inward part I'm glad he's not looking at me amen are you listening I don't need an atonement for my soul if my soul is eternal right right The Advocate is not for your soul if your soul is eternal the Redeemer is not for your soul if your soul is eternal it is for the rest of us body and spirit amen I agree with one brother years ago he said your brain is the first thing that needed to be baptized and I agree with that that's right we need a baptism of the Holy Ghost on the brain you know cleans it up and straighten it up but does everybody understand that's all all I want to make is one point the soul is perfectly totally sinless so when the prophet is said to bride is perfectly stand before God perfectly totally sinless he's talking about the soul of the individual but the body is still under an advocate but as the Old Testament person that sin that they committed under the atonement was covered but when Jesus Christ came he eradicated it he died once for all he eradicated sin then with our bodies and Spirits we're still of the world and human Mortals that are subject to doing wrong but that don't justify that's right you don't say well well I just can't Happ it no man you're lying right you said I can't help it I can't help lust and I can't help this you're lying I can't help seeing what's out there I agreee with you on that cuz but everywhere you turn there's plenty of them now you can't help seeing but you can help lust them and you know the greatest thing that's always helped me to be one thing a sister told me one time said brother Dale don't look you over when he's walking up to you he said he looks in your eyes I don't have problems as a human mortal I've never tried to express Perfection that I live this life of this no I'm a human mortal but you know I try to look at every woman as my sister that's right in the Lord you understand that in the Lord I'm a human mortal BL but I know how to handle that thing just say forgive me is a good way of do it it and don't tell me women that you don't have your thoughts and and all I've done been too old the women's bathroom is nastier than the men if you want to be playing that's right we're not living in the old days of where women was counted to be something different they have their thinking ability remember it was the woman that had the thoughts wrong to start with that caused all of this problem that's right but you see I'm just trying to be honest have you asked God today to forgive you well let me think back over s now if you got to think it over you got a problem if you got to think over what you've done today to see whether or not you need to repent you got a problem that's right I just say Lord forgive me for being a human sir and you know I wish sometimes that doctrines would have been different you see you're crazy I know it but I just tell you like I think it'd be nice for us just get a new body if we didn't have no problems with this one but it don't work amen but this body can be redeemed amen yes sir Paul wouldn't saying I can't help it living like the devil but he said with my body I serve the law of sin I'm a human mortal living in life and have problems in life but he said I thank God that inward man is after the the law of the spirit right then he could say in Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no condemnation and watch you to those that are in Christ Jesus Paul do you mean that it's blessed to be in Christ Jesus and we know how to repent so we stopped that's where I got in trouble years ago trying to preach a little message called interpolating cuz inter ating simply means that you're bringing down from one language to another or thought to correct what you're thinking to not leave loopholes when you speak in Spanish and you say we say we're going to town in Spanish they say to town we go even if you translated the words exact it's entirely different you're interpolating and Scofield says that Paul interpolated the next part of that verse Romans 8:1 he said therefore there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus the holy spirit said Paul you left the loophole that people will come along to think they can live like the devil and get by with it as long as they claim they're in Christ Jesus so you know what he said to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit right I Die daily he said right you ever heard it preached on justification and sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost in three stages of each one the disciples were Sanctified right and then they got the new birth you know that Paul taught a daily sanctification that's right that's what he's doing he's teaching the daily sanctification a daily repenting and cleansing and setting aside that's why all those scriptures are there to keep us from going the wrong way sinless Perfection there's no need of talking about it but what about what a prophet would say we don't have time to get them off and read them because we're running out he had to die for all of us he had to Die the perfect one that we imperfect could be made perfect in him by partaking of every word of his Bible perfect blood perfect atonement perfect loosing there is therefore now no condemnation his death gave us the blood the blood has loosed us there's no condemnation how can there there is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin we are free Guiltless don't listen to man listen to the word we are Loos by the blood you so when nobody can be perfect the Bible says there is none perfect he said there's your contradiction cuz you're taking that scripture and then the other scripture says that in Jesus Christ you're perfect the law having a shadow of things to come could not make the comary to perfect what's the subject Paul's speaking of here Perfection God requires Perfection no one could ever come to Heaven outside of being perfect perfect you must be perfect and yet the scripture says None is perfect so if you must be perfect to come to heaven then and the scripture says not is perfect and we're all and we're we've all sin and come short of the glory of God how are we going to enter God's living place and Dwelling Place when he requires Perfection Jesus said I Believe In The Sermon on the Mount be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect think of perfection that's what God requires of the person of perfection amen the Bible said he that is born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin how can you make a man a sinner when the blood bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is between him and God that would scatter sin till there's there are be nothing L of it how can that pure blood of Christ ever let a man sins pass die he says he cannot it paid your price it settled a question your sins as Scarlet you're as white as snow red like Crimson white like wool then you have no sin you are perfectly sinless no matter what you done or what you do you're still sinless as long as you've accepted Jesus Christ as your savior think on these things we got to be perfect to go to heaven so one day these bodies are going to be changed they have to be changed to match the rest of us you know the Eternal part of the Soul so your soul is the only thing that's Eternal by the new birth and now listen if you have the new birth and you go out and do wrong see now this is why the statements going for a while are going to be confusing if you don't have any birth to understand I've explained it over and over you sin you the prophet said you sin a sin as a Christian he said you reap a tug for so what do you do immediately home do it you say forgive me right you know God don't Recon sin to a born again believer that's right I don't understand that when you just got to explain without to give an account that don't annihilate that that settles that why wouldn't you want to give an account what would be your reason for not wanting to give an account that's why they be embarrassing you're talking about eternal life eternal life is a person it's not something to play with right and if that person's inside of you I ask myself all the time if Jesus Christ was living in this flesh would he be doing this you don't ever think like that you don't ever talk to yourself Jesus Christ wouldn't do this so if he's living in my flesh he wouldn't do it in my flesh no more than he doing it in his flesh brother R said he was tempted by women to be tempted of sin is not sin lust when it's conceived stage one 2 three lust when it's conceived bringeth forth Sin Sin when it's finished bring forth death the Bible says it's not a sin to be tempted right is when we yield to the Temptation right right see Jesus was tempted in all points the Bible said like we are but yet without sin you say how did that happen don't ask me I can't explain it you're going to have to talk to God I don't I don't understand how Jesus being so Eternal as he was yet he could be a Satan could talk to him I don't understand how up there right now Satan can be up there in the presence of God talking about me and you he made it that way and I guess he wanted it that way I don't understand that's right he can get an audience with God at any time to go talk about you Mark and I can't get an audience with him to try to cover my sins time seemingly I look like he's gone on vacation when I'm praying you don't ever feel that way amen just remember he Ain brother rown said when you sin you want this quote he said when you sin said immediately the Holy Spirit knows you didn't mean that and he say you're forgiven how not all them quotes if people wants to quote one-sided we not quote at all there's none good no not one but we are the body of Jesus Christ amen and if David under the condition he was could go before God and say Lord I love you I'm sorry and God come back say you're the apple of my eye that's right David is the one that said blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin am because if he imput it to him he killed him why did he not kill King because David cried out in his heart oh Lord restore unto me the joy of thy salvation he had a repentant heart that's what God Said you you sacrifice and offerings become a stink in my nostrils he with to a man with an honest and a contrite heart right amen David was quick to repent amen and do what God Said what about us come on this what about you and me so well we've been over this we know what we're talking about here this okay but we just one more time tonight saying that in the New Birth we're perfectly totally sinless but in these human bodies we got problems that don't make us to where we can say I can't Happ it don't get into the garbage
