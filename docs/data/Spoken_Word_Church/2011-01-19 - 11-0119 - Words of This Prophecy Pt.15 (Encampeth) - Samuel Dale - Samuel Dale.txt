to Psalms um 34 and uh we had a good time Sunday afternoon with a brother and the fellowship with all of the the people from Gainesville there and pray that uh you know that the Lord blessed you and everything so we you know but just remember that also remember now we keep making the announcement all right now please let us know if you're coming to that uh banquet now don't wait and show up at the banquet because we're scheduling food we're scheduling tables we're scheduling this we're scheduling that in other words I wrote it down here if you don't let us know just don't show up I mean I know that's mean you said but we didn't know till the last moment well you know well just I don't know just don't show up because that's that's not right that you know we try to do that and there always somebody that comes and show shows up that's not on the schedule well we've got everything scheduled how would you like it if we come to your house and there was about 50 of us scheduled to come and wound up there 55 of us you wouldn't like it so you know let us know ahead of time you know it's just we just try to have a good time in the Lord and and all like that if you don't want to come that's your business but don't show up then to late to where that you haven't let us know to be able to schedule things cuz that's the way we we need that all right and just remember that let's see uh I reckon I've got all the announcements anyhow uh yeah okay we ain't got no fellowship meeting this coming month we we're doing good the next fellowship meeting will be at brother Tom Cains in March and then the one in uh May will be here the Lord willing so just remember these announcements father we thank you we love you and we just ask you that you would come now among us tonight and as we lord try to speak about you that you would come on the scene and and be with us father and that your love may be made manifest we need you and we just cherish your your presence because without that there wouldn't be no need of us Gathering here we can make a great speech and even though the speech would be eloquent eloquent and would be even correct it would still not profit anything without your presence Amen to come with us so just be with us and bless and guide each one as we lord commit the service to you in Jesus name amen Revelations 8 now forgive me for just being blunt when I say something like that you know cuz see that hurts my spirit you can say things and and it not hurt you maybe some of you have the gift to do that ability but I can't see that hurts my spirit so I got to get that off of me now but it's true don't just don't do it you know let let us know we do everything we can we pay for everything we schedule everything we do everything but see let us know if you're coming amen right see then that'll hurt your feelings and all but I'm sorry but see that it gets on my feelings and I have to get it off of me and I don't mean to get it off like that I have to get it off of me about saying things okay cuz that's not my nature not my ways all right let's go to the scripture the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of the prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now let's go over to PS 34 verse 7 the angel of the Lord in encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them man you may be seated Lord at his Blessing now we gave you a lot of quotes So some not being here Sunday now everybody don't get one because you didn't bring it back there I go say more but I made five copies if you wasn't here Sunday we'll give you a copy of the quotes and things and all and we just we want you to to have them and then the others is a couple of things that we'll use shortly now we've been talking about the angels of God and uh you know trying to bring down and and get to a place of understanding but see my main point is one thing I'm trying to get you and I to realize that the angels of God are real right there are not just spirits they're not just something that makes you feel good or bad or whatever but they're real they're real they're not you know and and in being that they you know they have a job to do you know and we'll put the title to this one you can call it in campus Because I looked that word up in campath it it really means to like in Camp or in other words means to lay Siege Siege you know like an army one Army laying Siege against the other one totally surrounding it totally uh uh you know captivating it and you remember when uh Elijah and you remember who was it Gaza there in the scripture when he you know he went out to look and he saw that or it might have been Elisha but any he saw the the army of the syrians and he thought it was really in bad shape and all and uh oh he was scared to death but the prophet looked out and he said why there's more for us than they are for them you know and that was uh that was truth now we think about angels and I I look this up to just to kind of find out something on it and we think of just a few but you know Jesus said that he could call 12 Legions of angels all right now I looked up some things to try to find out what what that was and according to Webster now Aion is either 3 to 6,000 all right now that's according to Webster all right now in the time basically when Jesus was there and looking it up there was basically 6,800 126 made a legion all right and then you can consider it because they said in foot soldiers it would be about 6,100 foot soldiers would make a legion all right and then in horsman it would be like 726 all right I kept looking to see what brother randam said he says a legion is like about 2,000 that's off the message why Christ speak he said it was like 2,000 well all right now Jesus said he could get 12 Legions if he needed them you know that would be what 240,000 that the way it would count up 240,000 Angels at his disposal so that evidently there must be 240,000 huh all right that's my point you know the point I'm trying to get you can get all those numbers and try to add it all up but the point is there's a large number of angels all right that's right and they're real amen and they're not just thoughts of your mind or or something you know right and see we know that they're not as I said like the the world today is is tied up in in Angel forms and different ideas and and they make babies angels and all of the different things and that's all well and good but and then they have female angels you know and they have these at Christmas and little glorious sitting out at the manger scene you know they're always trying to get that little catholic idea in about the female angels and the prophet of God said that now watch his wording he says that the angels are male all right but then he'll say that they have no gender all right right now i' like to give you every all the whole story to where you won't be you know looking down in on it sometimes and say well that would you know oh they they're they're not counted as gender but they are counted as male not female all right but there you know and there's many things to do and the angels of God now we think about that as the prophet it said you know that all born again Believers have a have an angel right all right so I believe that now that's what we've been talking about we see that we think that there's just that one Angel you know at our disposal well how many was it there was only two of them there of of Gaza and Elijah and there was more of them that was gathered around around the scripture said than there was of the whole Syrian Army and the prophet said there were thousands of that Syrian Army am yet there was more Angels there that's right now what I'm trying to do I'm wanting you to to think about how real the prophet said one of these days when we get dire angels will be just as real right you know it's it's people they'll be real it won't be that that you look around and see well there's an angel I guess and I I thought I felt an angel last night you know all of that's well and good that's your business but the thing of it is if those angels are not under the direct leadership of the Holy Spirit then you're dealing with the angels that fell after Satan's lie so there was one3 and brother Rand will quote it 2/3 most of the time but let's just take a third we'll take a third if they're just 24 ,000 uh Angels well what would be a third of that see that's how many angels fa and then you get over there and you try to figure out how that uh the 200,000,000 demons that was loosed y all right each one of those would be counted angels of Fallen Angels the demons and how many would that be 200,000,000 200 million is that the way that's counted but see you got a lot of angels right that's my point it's not just that God created a couple of angels yeah I need you I need you no he's got millions of angels evidently y cuz if if 200 million would be what fell then there would be 400 million that didn't fall you know so they just there's a lot of angels now right all right and it's not just one or two little things I was thinking the other day you know and I know I think crazy but I talked to somebody maybe Brother Gary about it but you know they say There's 7 billion people in the world and and people say well if all of the people was here that you know had been in the world you couldn't stand on the earth there wouldn't be enough room and I told him I said well what's the problem you know what's the trouble I mean why couldn't God take a mountain and shrink it to a stone and a lake to a pond and a pond to a puddle right and us to fit in there there'd be a lot of room you know right I mean that's just what I get to thinking about sometimes laying in the middle of the night and I think well Lord that's pretty good you just shrink the whole thing down and we'll all still be there won't be no problems there not troubled with it you know because he could take care of that right may be a carnal but it's still away but now what I want you to think about in this whole point that I'm trying to bring is that angels have a job to do right they were created for a purpose that's right and they have a job to do y and according to Hebrews 1 and4 13:14 we were on the the other day Sunday morning there that there ministering Spirits sent for those that are hirs of Salvation right see then we just think about one little angel that we've got don't think of it like that they were thousands of thousands gathered around Elijah right and how many do we need he said but I never thought about angels having a job well what are they for right amen the holl are holy holy holy Lord God Almighty how many million of us made for that purpose right right am see what what are we dealing with limiting god let's don't do that let's just open it up and let it let it be great and when we get there we'll see those angels that's and we'll see what they're there far right now we covered in the the message our Sunday morning that the angels of God would be counted as gifts now he wasn't talking about speaking in tongues etc etc right but gifts they each one have their own gift there is one dealing with that we gave it and it's on the notes that you have we gave it to her that brother around said the angels of God was called attributes right we see the there you have millions of millions of attributes my point of what I want you to think about lay this morning they're in the bed for a long time for couple hours just thinking on this that each one has a job sure amen and they're connected with you right and what you have need of right I see we we we put it all that's why that that mankind is a showed where the Prophet said that people will say well well we don't need Angels no more we' got the Holy Spirit and I gave you the quotes where he said that there was even a difference in the presence of the holy spirit that made him feel you know sweet and great and and then the other would make him feel you know in in an all when that angel came to him right see we see we we don't consider that but I'm trying to get us ready for when we get over on that other side but there's Angels I've heard people say that you know and all right that's their business maybe they know what you're talking about but they said every empty Pew in the church is filled with angels so every time is an empty P yours empty there's an angel sitting there all right but the thing of what I want you to do and see if we can believe the truth about the angels of God as we read there and it says singular angel of God encampeth right now we say oh that's just a Holy Spirit Well does it encamp around us or what does it do right I said they say well we don't need Angels no more well Paul had one that spoke to him Peter had an angel that spoke to him John had an angel that spoke to him brother R said there's more angels in the New Testament than there was in the old that's what I gave you our Sunday see we just look at it like one or two little angels running around they each one have their Y and you know I gave you the quotes where brother R said that that angel come to him said maybe it's a minor angel I think I've got one in here but anyhow they're there if you out there on the Internet run minor in your computer and you'll see it minor Angel he said the one come to him maybe a minor Angel that's why I said if he's a minor angel that was the reason then he couldn't tell the prophet what those seals were right he had to meet the greater Angel Amen to understand that right got a few more things to go on that when we when we get time but now listen if those angels have a job why don't we believe in it you know and and let them keep their work and do their job you know know that I said brother Brown's called that angel of his a minor Angel right you ever heard him call him an angel of healing on your notes right Hallelujah he had a Healing Ministry didn't he sure amen was he the one that told the people where everything was at what was going on Y and you see I know because when once you start saying that people people's mind connects and tries to to figure things out but see he'll be talking about I'm waiting on the angel of the Lord in a minute he'll say I'm waiting on the Holy Spirit he'll call that angel that come to him pillar fire and then he'll call it the angel of the Lord you see I finally met that angel that was a Shining Light y down there when I was born we we we don't read the message and think about what he's saying 19 in faith is the substance 47 412 Heavenly Father thou H has promised to heal the people I feel that the great me great messenger the angel of healing of God standing near the pull pit at this time angel of healing don't fight the substance they're too cool some saying it's cool some says it's hot look at the next one I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision 49718 our heavenly father tonight we pray that that this will be a glorious time may your angel of healing of Mercy the presence of the Lord Jesus be in the building so gently angel of healing right my commission 51501 you look at what I'm talking about he said what I'm speaking about the Lord Jesus and his healing Angel at the platform do you believe God has angels of healing commissioned Y what was it on the the bright serpent then what was it on the water of the pool of Bethesda if it wasn't an angel came from heaven right see see I'm not God's Gift the angel is God's gift it came out of Heaven go put that word the other ones where I saying it was a that it was a gift look at the next one believe us th this 51 505 God always sends a forerunning before some great event whenever you see Angels where whenever you see angels will come to the Earth for instance maybe the angel that deals with God's humble servant here that's a minor no doubt angel of healing or something or the spirit of some great something one of God's attributes what are we looking at right works I Do by Witnesses 53 to 16 look down upon this waiting group of people send the great spirit of God upon them and may as it were the angel of healing stretch his great Wings across this building tonight angel of healing message called look 1963 428 you talking about people life in h rollers and the bunch the wind comes down blows the water back not to them it was an angel of Mercy it was an angel of healing and I believe it was an angel though it seemed so simple but you see God hides in simplic an angel of healing now you see why he had a healing campaign right the healing campaign had to go out right now he said other people I was looking at these to other people are dealing with The Healing Ministry right well they would be dealing with the angels of God didn't when they we know brother random had what he had the the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ The Healing Ministry ministered by an Angel mhm you'll have two signs yep you'll take them by the hand then you'll know the secrets of the heart right you'll be able to tell them where everything's at like try to tell everybody you know tried always to say it they say the first pull they talking about a hand his hand would turn and that's right amen but what would he do he'd say you got cancer it's on your left lung now the hand didn't tell him where the cancer was the hand told him he had cancer he was a prophet the opening of the word told him where the rest was at do you see what I'm talking about see special gifts attributes of the angel of God all right I gave you these some more that goes with it so you read them where brother Brown said the angel of God angels of God comes down and encampeth around you or encamped right encamped in Camp is only used in the Bible brother doesn't use the word encampeth he uses the word encamp huh yeah he says stay there right then Angels stay there what great thing did Elijah do to bring the Angels down to his presence he knew there there all the time right that's it he wasn't afraid it was Gaza that needed his eyes open y amen and if we really just would realize those angels are there all the time right amen how many of them you need God making his promise 56 beginning end of the Gentile dispensation 55 message Called Love 58 letting off the pressure 62 but L Bemus 5 55 law having a shadow 56 influence 62 I'm just going down and reading these off influence in 63 803 read them they encamp about you they don't leave that's right well if I could just if that angel would just come and be with me and where'd you get that from where'd you get the idea the Bible said it encampeth encampeth means to Siege in other words surround right now what do you have need of tonight there's an angel specially specially designed for what we have need of you need healing right well I just thought it was be believing in what Jesus done at Calvary amen but what about an angel involved in it now like I said and I say it again the prophet said if that angel said anything contrary to the word he's not the angel of the Lord does that solve a problem right that's why brother R said we we have these people get all tied up with angels you know seeing things right big man that I can call his name he'd see angels in his home his children and even see angels all right I ain't going to argue with him I wouldn't argue with none whatsoever but where it led him to the word I hope he hears this of course you know what he believes it has ain't a Baptist in the world that don't believe God LED them to the Baptist Church Church come on right right we believe we right when we was there didn't we brother dick Us in the Presbyterian you think he was wrong no you thought she was right you get my point I'm just trying to get you to to look at the fact of angels and angels having a specific job right and it's involving you it's something for you to wor that you can have confidence right brother D aren't you afraid when you're preaching why would I be afraid I've always said if I'm wrong somebody corrects me thank God I I got the benefit out of it but if I'm right I'm not worried about it right you're not worried about preaching to who or what no sir right from the pope of Rome to the people of this message amen I just tell you what I believe see I believe angels are real amen I believe they're real more real than what we are see we think beating on the pet we think this is wood this is something great tangible remember the Angels come before this did right amen y created by the Living God Amen and they got a job to do right they're dealing with you and I yeah all right so I hope you caught all of that I wrot myself myself a bunch of notes to cover some things but I hope you'll just listen angels are real they're not just something that we feel we just oh I feel I can just feel this presence what are you talking about I feel the presence of the Holy Spirit don't you sure I do but you know I've never seen the Holy Spirit right but I have seen other other things that I believe was related to that why because it's never taken me away from the word right did they tell you anything no sir read just D to let me know let me know not to be afraid because I know where that the word is has told me where I can stand all right now let's get started on the message tonight right now if you flip over on your notes to number 17 we cover the others there's a couple in there I want to hold till the later about the angel of the Covenant and try to bring it back in because Jesus Christ is the Angel of the Covenant let's get started on this part now we've dealt with that there's many angels that's what I hope you're catching tonight there there's angels for they've got different jobs different things to do they're connected with your salvation and we'll read in a minute where the ones that drove us out is now driving us in all right now and then to see and to realize that they're here why are we afraid why are we afraid when the doctor tells us we've got cancer why are we afraid why are we afraid when something goes wrong when we're supposed to believe that the angels of God are encamped about us and I keep saying that over where other people out there realize it the Bible says the angel of the Lord singular encampeth brother Brandon will quote that 98% of the time as the Angels plural right of God encampeth all right now it's all the Holy Spirit right but to just say it's the Holy Spirit right it's the like to say well that's just God well yeah it's it's just God no they're Angels amen under the leadership of the holy spirit it's not to say the Holy Spirit it wasn't the Holy Spirit the prophet said that woke Paul up and told him to not be afraid right he said there he had the holy spirit it's not the holy spirit that told Peter the thing it's the angels of the Lord am that told him all right but see they're under direct supervision as we' call it they make no move just as it was down there when the Hebrew children you know would in the fiery furnace wormwood come up and said I'll put it out right I can take care of that I'm quoting brother random you know that he said you've done a wonderful job and great but said I'm going myself am thank he even said Gabriel came up we ain't got to that yet he said Gabriel came up and said I'll go he said you're a great angel I said it's not your job see wormwood was to destroy the world he controls the water now watch I guess you think when he got through with the water that now he's setting up in heaven twiddling his STS Ain got nothing else to do who's controlling the water now to keep it from destroying the world oh the Moon it well I'm glad you thought of that go who controls the moon amen you see one of these days we'll realize how God could leave heaven and come to Earth Y and the world keep running right amen and all their hearts keep beating and all the wind keeps blowing all the rain keeps falling somebody's in charge they got a job to do worm wood you've done a good job this is my phrase in there you destroyed the world with water now keep it from doing it again so every day he's controlling it make sure that Moon keeps rolling just right there the water still here that was in the flood come on folks right what is the world 2/3 water oh yeah all it take is a Moon turning just a high to cover it right back over but wormwood's keeping it from doing it that's right Gabriel I'll go down you're a great Angel but I'm going myself he said what Gabriel do we'll get to it one of these days Gabriel announced the first coming of Jesus Christ and Gabriel announces the second coming of Jesus Christ amen that's corre run those quotes in your computer till we get back it'll be a few weeks probably give you time to look up some things Gabriel's job is not to go down in the FY furnace right his job is to announce a second coming amen I'm going brother around now Michael amen Michael say I'll go and we know Michael is Christ he said no you've done your job you still got more work to do and I'm going the South you see Michaels one to run the devil Out of Heaven Lucifer Michael keeps him out he allows him to go back into the presence of God to talk to God but he's not allowed for anything else Michael is going to stand up and fight for Israel amen right that's right you see Michael was the one that Gabriel could not get back to Daniel that's right Michael the great Prince is called done his job you see what I'm talking about in other words God was saying you've done your jobs you got your jobs to do take care of that I'm going myself he said and when they looked down in there the man said what AM forth man is like unto the Son of God we might as well go ahead and cover that part cuz who is that look at number 15 on your notes I was going the other way but we'll go this way he talking about the children of Israel the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel they followed the pillar of fire rather that that was the angel of the Covenant that talked to Moses in the burning bush who was that come down in the the fiery furnace one like un the Son of God who was the angel of the Covenant Christ Moses forsook Egypt esteeming the reproach of the Angel of the Covenant you say you ain't quoting that correctly read it esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than that of Egypt right he saw Christ and what had been leading him right he realized it that's on the message we would see Jesus 62704 these are just a couple now I just picked two influence 1963 1114 Moses when was he was in the presence of God that watched him watch him by the pillar of fire that was back in that burning bush the Lord spoke out and anyone knows that Pillar of Fire was Christ he was the angel of the Covenant Moses forsook Egypt esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than that of Egypt so it was the angel of the Covenant and when he appeared in that burning bu by this by the side way in front of Moses and the voice says take off your shoes who is he talking about the angel of the Covenant the one who was going to come and do each one you'll find it in the acts 7 and 33-38 that Jesus y it says was in the burning bush that spoke to Moses who Jesus Christ the angel of the Covenant why would we worry when the angels have jobs to take care of to take care of you and I but the angel of the Covenant is in charge of all right did not God tell Moses at the burning bush he said my angel will go before thee and he said nothing won't be able to stand in other words in your way wouldn't that what he said to the prophet when he come to him he said you better fear him because my name is in him is what he told Moses see the angel of the Covenant was there Christ is who I'm talking about but the angels have jobs to do you're out driving down the highway and all of this garbage is going on today out there and all of the wrecks that you think right that you really are a good driver oh yeah Bo I tell you what I a good driver I just know how to with you I just yeah and what about that angel taking care of you what about it how come it hadn't killed you all right we'll get back a little bit more on that one CU I want to speak some more on that part but I just want you to see that the holy spirit is the Angel of the Lord yes yes he's the angel of the Covenant Christ is the Angel of the Covenant the Lord Jesus Christ is the Angel of the Covenant given every title where you won't run off on a something to it's all there yes but that all of those angels are under direct leadership y of the Holy Spirit to take care of you and I they're a sign for that job if I always told you I'll have to apologize when I get to her cuz I've kept mine busy I know right amen that's not a joke listen each one of those angels then can be called in manifestation of the angel of God just as we have seen that God has manifested has made manifest his being that he's trying to make known and he's trying to make those angels known too he's wanting to see brother Gary what's going on what makes your heart beat that's right oh it's just yeah what keeps you alive we you go to sleep and you go into a total unconscious State what keeps you alive remember they're assigned to take care of the erors of Salvation that's what we want to get to see each one of them has a work to do all under the direct leadership of the Holy Spirit but a work for them to do individually so then don't just say it's the Holy Spirit I said a moment ago go no more than to say well that's just God you know that's I don't know what y'all get so all excited about Father Son and Holy Ghost it's just God he's got three manifestations and you cross up those manifestations what have you done each one of those manifestations is assigned a specific thing to do right right now right all right let's try to deal with one that let's go to Isaiah 6 try to get into this one about the Surs cuz we were talking about this is the Bible study and they didn't know I was going to go ahead and cover all this and I didn't want to tell everybody I was going to do it either so I wanted to kind of keep it to myself and get to it but listen the word seraphim is only used here in Isaiah 6 the other times it will be used as cherubims all right now we're going to see how interrelation that cherubim and that cim is right but each one of them has to have a job yep right but they can be the same the brother R say they're the same you there Isaiah 6 in the in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood The Sims each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one cried un Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord God of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the temple moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I woe is me for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king of the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a CO live coat in his hand which he had taken from the tong with the tongues from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying who shall I S whom shall I send and whom will go farest then said I here am I send me this is the great Isaiah that wrote 66 books in the Bible that Isaiah needed some cleansing before he could go great prophet raised the prophet raised brother rown said in the in the king's palace with the King there but when the king got exalted up brother R said Isaiah was praying and crying out before the Lord because of what the king had done you remember the king went in and told him he's going to all for incense and he immediately was struck with Leprosy when he did they had to put him in a house to himself the rest of his life and Isaiah was really concerned and he went to the house of the Lord to pray and as he did he fell into a trance the prophet said and this is what he said he saw right he saw a way that he could go Isaiah said I can't go I've got unclean lips and I dwell among people that's got unclean Li there nobody can take your message Lord and go so here come a serim one ass sign for a special job y not to keep the world running not to hold the water from destroying it right not to announce the first and second coming m not to fight with the Devil and conquering here comes a zim and Scofield even knows it because they knew the difference between the word seraphim and cherubim right now he interrelates it and brother brandham does too but Scofield if you go down in your footnotes you'll see that this seraphim here is considered as to be a burner right yep his job is a special one to keep the worshipper clean Isaiah knew he needed to be cleansed before he could take the message and the seraphim got on his job and done it took a cold and cleansed his lips right what about the one that keeps us clean amen what about it what do these angels have to do with us now we'll start on number 17 on the notes Jehovah Gyra part two 1962 706 God put sarim there what's their job we'll get back to Isaiah in a minute but I want you to get this point it didn't just appear with Isaiah right the seraphim even though he's not mentioned as a seraphim with a s somebody hearing me say it cuz it not not much different than cherim sarim sarim spelled with an s look where he started his job what are you to do sarim I'm to keep the worshipper I'm to deal with the ARs of Salvation right so what did he do God put the seraphim there guarding that tree that no one would touch it now he's got sarapes out trying to drive them into the tree that's right same one that drove us away from the tree cuz see we couldn't do that I listening uh we was last night to where the Prophet said they would have took of that tree and liveed forever right we know they couldn't part took of the tree and lived eternally but they would have lived forever in a fallen condition and that couldn't work so we had to drive us away right he said well it would just ain't no way they could have got there well let see that's like we're tied up that there ain't no such thing as Angels cuz I never seen one I don't believe in them that's what people says you know CU I've never seen one well you're a prophet I hope you C the things that I covered he said a preacher is even an angel amen Paul called him that and then you got angels of the church AG Messengers then you got what we covered there Sunday morning that you've even got investigating Angels flying around and flying saucers to investigate and we read here tonight that you got a healing Angels right and we read that they're encamped about that they don't leave they stay with us always so what do you have need of well now brother D what I'm going to do is I'm going to try to find out which Angel going to help us like I said Sunday what good would it do to find out if my angel was so and so they said brother brand why don't you ask that angel what his name is he said you don't talk when he's there right instead of wan to know what the angel had to say about them they W know what his name what's his name I want know his name I got to know his name I I want Heaven helpless that's right what good does it know what brother Dale's got what have you got you better be trying to find your angels and I gave them to you the other day I've got them laying back there in my office right now where the prophet of God said the reason we don't see Angels is because we're not dedicated enough right right now that's what he said he said that angel comes to me he said when I'm fasting and praying he said by being a born again Christian that put us into a realm that made us subject to the supernatural and the reason we don't see Angels is that we are not dedicated enough right but then somebody else say something about oh they think they something well they try to make something out ofel you'll answer for that part if that's what you think about me because I've always tried to get you to see the angelist with you right cuz that's the only one's going to do you any good the angel with me ain't going to do you one bit of good right it's the one with you right you got to be dealing with it Paul down there in in the boat would call out angel I need you to come down here and said which one are you well I guess you're so and so he said I'm decided to get Peter out of jail I got a job to do I'm not coming I got a job to do right mind is to get Peter out of jail y but you see we want to find out all this about angels instead of trying to deal with what God's dealing with you and I how is he trying to minister the to the hours of Salvation don't you believe it you're an hour of Salvation amen don't you believe you're a child of God but you see that Surfin back there now we'll get to it in a second what is it going down uncertain sound 1962 74 there were two trees in the Garden of Eden one of them was life and one was death somebody was asking me this question the other day and I didn't mean to bring this in but when I found it I thought that'd be a good placez A lot of people think that that Eve was a tree of death yeah well now look what your Prophet said one of them was life and one was death one of them was the woman the other one was the man now he called him two trees in the garden the man and the woman y but he's not talking about Adam and Eve right the life that come by the woman dies but life that come by man lives see what did just build that up get the man up so big oh yeah here's the main part Sims guarded the Tree of Life which was the bread of life that come from God out of heaven now you know where that go to doing who was it that come down in the wilderness to the children of Israel who brought the bread are you listening I'm trying to get you to see that angels have a job they're not just floating around they got a job to do it's to the HS of Salvation the children of Israel were the HS of Salvation amen and God was taking care of Bringing Down the bread maybe one bringing down the quail maybe wormwood was there to make sure that when they struck that rock that they got the water amen you see what I'm trying to get you to see the angels have jobs they're a sign to that influence 1962 1013 number 22 when you not he's talking about how they saw the throne and the thing his train was following him and he lifted up in the heavens and he saw back and forth the temple Sims flying Oh My Sims it means burners the word seraphim means which is next to the altar actually the seraphim is the one who receives the sacrifice and cleanses the worshipper and then presents him to God now don't you want to believe in that AEL sir I sure want to believe he's got a job to do I want him to do that job don't you in position of God to serim does Now The Sims was Angelic beings and watch and they are the very next ones to God right at the altar and they receive the sacrifice it shows the justice of God that sin cannot come in the presence unless it's been a tone far see these seraphim you remember in the church ages how that they guarded them gospels one on either side you remember we took them back to the Garden of Eden with a flaming sword there to guard the altar right next to God burners he said what is the one who receives the sacrifice and cleanses the worshipper now you remember when Jacob laid down put his head on a rock had a vision dream he saw an angel look from where he was going into heaven and angels ascending and descending the latter what were those angels doing right taking up his offering bring and bringing him back a blessing right taking up his offering are we not to present our bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto the Lord which is our reasonable service then that angel is taking you sacrifice right what did the prophet say about adoption that that angel the Holy Spirit that is your guardian and said he goes before the father and says he's acting just like you right he said take him out now in front of the people right you see what I'm talking about Surs are to keep us clean what happens up there in the Book of Revelations I said the other day about it over the Book of Revelation you got the prayers of the Saints right and the Bible says they're poured out and that's what causes the tribulation period is when the prayers of the Saints are poured out cuz a nobody praying anymore that God will hear amen burners to keep us clean influence 63 112 the vision it's is simple he saw God upon his throne lifted up and note the Heavenly Surin which means burners a special designed person right oh we talk a lot about the devil what he is but around calls him a person then when we say person Body Spirit Soul he's not that that's where our minds gets taught and that's what I'm I thought of it this week I might as well put it on here cuz see when I give you something I underline what I want you to do I give you the whole paragraph where you can go read it to see if I'm talking right but you know what most of you don't do when I read what I want to read you look down and you keep on reading so you don't know what I said my brother Dale I have a right to read if I want to bless God read all you want to I'm just trying to make a point right you'll lose the whole point how many of you caught what I said instead of reading on down below there but Isaiah in the temple right how many of you understood what I said Satan is a person but he's not a body spirit and soul person right the holy spirit is a person but it's not Body Spirit and soul see when we say person we look at a human element He says this seril is a specially designed person he not a body Spirit Soul human being right he's a created angel of God a person see here what we do influence 631 1212 that was paragraph E40 this is E9 now watch what he says look what this Angel does this surf him or maybe you never have accepted him at all and you'd like to say this morning God let that word sink into me until I can cover my face in humility and cover my feet and kneel at your altar until the Sims will wave the glory of God over my soul and cleanse me with his holy fire he's talking about salvation right you mean the seraphim has something to do with Sal right okay influence 62 1013 he's talking about when Holy Angels in other words you say you're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian P Who Are You When Holy Angels hide their holy face under the wings to stand in the presence of God when Angels a being that's actually Beyond Angels the Angels don't stand there only the seraphim they're beyond angels and God so holy until they cover their face in his presence sures worshippers burners to keep the worshipper clean keep going influence 1963 803 I like to use these because the people are say well after the seals he changed well this is where I'm reading from after the seals broke on most of these no and we notice that the Heavenly serim was flying back and forth in the temple now the serim actually the Hebrew word there is burners they were the one who offered incense and the sacrifice okay it's just a higher order of angels that makes a way for the sinner as long as there's a sacrifice and these seraphim especially these burners had a special office they stayed right in the presence of God they're the same as the cherubims they were right and they were right in the Pres pres of God influence 63803 that was paragraph 67 this is paragraph 72 when seraphim the highest order of angels right by The Mercy Seat the burners of the sacrifice had to cover their holy face to stand in his presence and here they was God sitting up there on his throne and these cherubims going back and forth screaming day and night holy holy holy is the Lord God do you know what I'm meaning influence paragraph 6063 11:14 we find in this Vision that he saw God lifted up high on the throne then he noticed another thing note around him was in the temple where he was at where these Heavenly seraphim if you'll check that word I think it's only used about twice once or twice in the Bible and it's not cherubims this and you just said a minute ago sh and Chans put it right together now watch you it's not cherubims but it's next to cherubims something like an Angelic being and yet it isn't an angel it is an angel but it's a special person what they are they're burners of sacrifice in the Bible where the sacrifice of course brings in or leads in makes a way for the sinner to Holiness and these serim burning the sacrifice which was required they want to that was their duty but brother taale Jesus died he's up in heaven he ain't burning sacrifices why not yeah ain't burning animals right I ain't burning lambs and right goats and sheep they're worshippers to keep me and you clean their job is to keep us clean I'm clean brother I got the Holy Ghost amen but what about our daily lives yeah right that's right yeah maybe we'll understand one of these days why the Bible says by David in the Psalms blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin right blessed let me paraphrase it all right blessed is the man that has a burner in heaven a seraphim that can take his life and keep it clean to where God can use them right yep and that the sin never comes into the presence of God that's right amen maybe we'll learn one of these days why God can forget because if he don't if your sins are forgiven he's forgotten maybe some Angel has to take care of that I never thought about angels that way but amen he said the highest form highest order of angels highest order influence 1964 215 number 29 on your notes Now The Sims There Are Not Angels they are supposed to be the sacrifice burners that plead the way for the guilty that's there right there come on now is that what I just said Y and they were sacrific burners a special covering was over these beings and go and showing that God is all holy amen God is all holy and they were screaming to the top of their voice holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty holy holy holy right in the presence of God remember it was the seraphim and the cherubims that guard the holy place there are the ones that takes a sacrifice and offers it and here they was living right in the presence of God's cream now you're timeing together random you're tying together cherubims and Sims you're saying one time that it's different sarim is different from cherim then you saying that they're the same 64 3-1 15 the message on influ note the Heavenly Sims with coverings over their face now the seraphim is the burner of the sacrifice which is one of the highest order of angels they're next to the cherubims there is angels and listen to him there is angels and then Sims and then cherubims you don't mind putting Angels Sims chims and Sur is actually the burner sacrifice making the way for the Sinners approach a real high order of Angels in the temple identified Masterpiece of God 64205 and there's Angels such as there's seraphim and cherubims and Angels great angels and degrees you saying brother Rand there's degrees of angels amen each one has his place that's right and even in the new world to come the kings of the earth bring their honor into the city we're always going to be that way because God is not a Sears and Rob book Harmony House amen I like that he is a god of reiy and he makes one way and one makes one one way and one another but we must serve him in the way that God made us and be glad and stay behind his word that's the way God Did It influence 64 63 11:14 the prophet confessed caused him to say I'm a man of unclean lips a prophet God we know another Vision like that when he saw up and saw these cleansing P these cleansing power of God now watch how God did he sent one of the shims and took the tongue took the tongue took a hot Cal off the F fire altar excuse me put it in his hands come laid Isaiah's head back and touched his lips and said your iniquity is gone amen then Isaiah learned another lesson I might drop this in might not be very appropriate but I believe it is did you notice God cleanses his Prophet by fire not by theology or books of some kind see he cleanses his people by fire Holy Ghost and Fire not by Declaration of Creeds or books or something you got to learn a bunch of prayers and so forth he cleans cleans them by fire off of the altar that's how he set his him in order yeah yes sir that's how he cleansed His prophets at the beginning when the 120 was in the watch that's how he cleansed His prophets at the beginning when 120 was in an upper room the Holy Spirit fell and tongues of fire set upon them you ever thought about Isaiah and the burning the temple and Sim sir amen they were cleansed and ready for service that's how God cleanses not by learning get a Bachelor of art or a DD PhD but getting holy fire from heaven that takes the lying off of your lips and takes the carnality out of you Burns that stuff away that draws of the world and puts his presence in there and lives through that whole that person Holy Fire is what God cleanses his church with Isaiah learned that he ought we ought to learn it that God don't cleanse by knowledge he cleansed by fire okay let me get we got two more influence 1963 11:30 the be is in other words another service he's talking about how he goes down to the temple notice the Heavenly seraphim as they flew through the temple now seraphim is a it is a mighty word there it's not an angel but it's what is it what it is it's a burning sacrifice burning he has something to do with the atonement because he offers a sacrifice to make a way for the repentant sinner to the throne of Mercy what a position higher than an angel greater than an angel for the angel stand back but the seraphim goes forward with the offering right in the presence of God a burner of the offering of the prayer that's been made the burner of the sacrifice like I said Jacob what' you see Angels ascending right descending what happen to uh what it come on mind the house of canas you read your Bible it says your arms that's right your prayers yep your Deeds your doings has come up before God the sacrif ice burner was taken care of he said now I've sent a man to tell you the rest of the story right because this message is so important I can't trust it with an angel the angel might be able to keep me clean but he can't bring me the message the holy spirit will do that but it can only come through the body of Christ amen so he says Peter you go down there now to con the house of Kus y he said I'm not going that's a gentile don't send me down there he said don't you call unclean what I've cleansed now I quoting the scripture he said you go Peter Y and open the doors to the kingdom to to the house of canus cuz his arms his deeds his prayers and things has come before me and now I'm sending you down because the sacrifice burner has done his job now you go amen and you open the door Harvest Time 1964 1212 we'll try to get to in a quip the Potter is Roman 8 tells us who can tell the Potter can the clay say make me thus thus see no God has to display all his attributes and so he has to make a vessel of dishonor and the other one to honor to show that that one up of the course but he's Sovereign you see nobody can tell him what to do he makes us different even to that that we're told in the Bible that the star Stars differ one from another one star differs from another you know there's a difference in heaven and angels there's a difference in heaven remember the word of over while ago it was in degrees there's difference in heaven in angels Angelic beings there is Angels there is Chim chims there is Sims and there there there difference there and we're all different there's a difference in them I want to read this last one but I'm not going to say any more about it 29 97 Church age book yes there he stands the Lord Of Glory once as the father he was surrounded by the Angels the archangels the cherubims the the archangels the cherubims and Sims and the whole host of Heaven crying holy holy we got to cover the archangels now that we don't have time tonight we'll get into that the Lord willing Sunday archangels you see what I'm trying to say though there's Angels they're just right around us right with us all the time they don't leave us we read from the prophet they don't leave us and we don't just look at it well well brother Dale I finally got it but after you preaching for quite a while now I got it down to where I could at least see one Angel and now you come out and talk about millions of them well what do you have de of there's an angel designed for that purpose that's right I wish you'd read these over and over especially about the burners and then think in your mind about what's in the Bible you know like the scriptures I gave you know look in Daniel and see how that Daniel was out there and God came to it cuz somebody made him clean Isaiah somebody made him clean somebody come down on the day of Pentecost and the tongues of fire well I thought it just a little liing through it must have been something enough to burn them out cuz the Holy Ghost to come in yeah but what if they hadn't been the burning out first see that's what we want to make it we want to make the tongue that come down the speaking the Pentecost will do that and they make it speaking in tongues as the Holy Ghost and we go another step upward and we talk about well it just a tongue that come down and just lck on and that was only making way for the Holy Ghost to come on down into the person right sure amen had the spirit and the body not been made right the Holy Ghost would have never fell into the heart right the tongues of fire came to burn out everything that's why we'll realize one of these days why the bible say that it's the Holy Ghost and Fire it doesn't say fire and Holy Ghost that's not scripture it's the Holy Ghost and Fire because that Holy Ghost is a fire to burn out everything the prophet said that's left of you and I right to where God can come and live into our heart by the baptism of the Holy Ghost right the burner to make the worshipper clean well I I thought once we got I thought all that sacrifice and all that stuff was back in the Old Testament well I thought we were supposed to be a Living Sacrifice right amen I thought we were supposed to present ourselves a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God like I said maybe that's why we don't see Angels right is because we're not presenting ourselves in the right way maybe that's why we're not Christians because the Holy Ghost can't burn out what's in US he said well brother Dale I've seen you have problems we're going to have them to we get out of here folks whether you believe it or not and it's not going to be our righteousness or our Holiness or our doings that makes God fulfill his word he's going to do it because he promised it amen amen the Holy Ghost didn't come in the upper room room because them people were so holy in P was what they had was there that the Holy Ghost had to make it to the burner yes sir but they wasn't right that's right God promised it when the day of Pentecost was fully come it was a promise yes the prophet said he's not going to send the headstone upon our marriage right he said he's going to send it because he promised it right well you know what you may think I'm so carnal as can be but you know what that's going to mean that's going to mean that our burners our Angels our seraphim is really going to have to be at work in the end time that's right to make up people that could be even Pro even nowhere worthy but he's going to do it right and he may have to burn us out real good with that Holy Ghost in fire come on Brothers I hope you understand I'm not just talking about some kind of Angel something I'm trying to get you to see how real they are what they're doing they're they're they're a special we read it a designed person for a job I want to make sure sure cuz I've got a message to bring it up over that behind this Sunday to make sure we don't get tied up in the wrong thing and don't get tied up into trying to find out what Angel goes with what where we can deal with what yep that's right let me ask you one simple question who do you pray to who do you pray to well I pray Brother once's inside of me well why you talk out loud well I only do that where other people oh you want to be exalted because you want other people to hear what you're saying okay who do you pray to one of these days we'll realize what Paul would be saying when he said the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ 1 2 3 4 5 and you'll listen if you'll please do this with brother randam and listen and listen how many times he makes this statement in his prayer he said father I thank you for sending your son that he may die in my place to make me Worthy was brother brandom a trinitarian so I want to make sure we don't get on to trying to find out about angels that's right well now which one now brother D tell me which one is which one is assigned for which job we just read what the prophet said they're assigned for we just quoted scriptures of what they're assigned for it now what else do you want that's not going to help you find it well I want to make sure I'm praying to the right one you know that they're saying now don't pray to Jesus cuz he's not God cuz he was just a man till the River Jordan and the Holy Ghost left him he was just a man and they're saying don't pray to Jesus a iot don't he said ask anything in my name I didn't know was that way that's but how do you asking his name let's thing 46 in 46 in the red book anybody have a need be redeemed from every the Holy Spirit make the conation have let the Holy Ghost come let the Holy Ghost take the con ho GH you have a need healing Angel the prophet said did it leave he said every Born Again believe let all creatur now had the right to lay hands on the S and believe that God will heal he said every preacher has a right lay hands on the SE the Holy Ghost about it makation trust in God and the Holy Ghost do you want the fire of soulation TR let the Holy Ghost your arms has come up before God the Holy G now he's sending you the Holy Ghost all got to do brother just believe must been a pretty good do you want the about you see what God Christ make TR let the Holy Ghost go let the Holy Ghost come let the Holy Ghost make the consecration trust in the Holy Ghost what about it you believe it you
