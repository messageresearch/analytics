[8:48] one lord that we may all be together as

[9:04] speak to our hearts you said in your
[9:06] word that you sent your word and healed
[9:08] us and delivered us from destruction so
[9:10] we depend upon you
[9:12] guide us now keep us in jesus name
[9:15] amen
[9:17] matthew 5 37 i thought we'd be true with
[9:21] this the other day but i got a couple
[9:23] more messages so
[9:24] we just keep on reading this from
[9:26] matthew
[9:28] 5.
[9:29] verse 37
[9:30] but let your communication be yeah
[9:34] for whatsoever is more than these cometh
[9:36] of evil
[9:38] you have heard that it hath been said an
[9:39] eye for an eye and a truth for a two but
[9:42] i say unto you that you resist not evil
[9:45] but whosoever shall smite thee on thy
[9:47] right cheek turn to him the other also
[9:50] and if any man shall sue thee at the law
[9:53] and take away thy coat let him have thy
[9:55] cloak also and whosoever shall compel
[9:58] thee to go a mile go with him twain
[10:01] give to him that asketh thee and from
[10:04] him that would borrow of thee
[10:06] turn not thou away
[10:09] you have heard that it hath been said
[10:11] thou shalt love thy neighbor
[10:13] and hate thine enemy but i say unto you
[10:16] love your enemies bless them that curse
[10:18] you
[10:19] do good to them that hate you and pray
[10:21] for them which despitefully use you
[10:24] and persecute you now remember
[10:27] coming from the beatitudes blessed are
[10:29] you blessed are you blessed are you now
[10:31] he's sitting down a stage to show you
[10:34] what the life of christ
[10:36] is to be we are a blessed people right
[10:39] but now here is what we must live back
[10:42] it's going to take the new birth to do
[10:44] that part but he's describing that and
[10:46] bringing it down
[10:47] to the point
[10:51] see so verse 44 but i say unto you love
[10:54] your enemies bless them that curse you
[10:56] do good to them to hate you and pray for
[10:58] them which to fightfully use you and
[11:00] curse persecute you
[11:02] that you may be the children of your
[11:03] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[11:06] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[11:08] good and send us rain on the just and on
[11:11] the unjust
[11:12] for if you love them which love you what
[11:15] reward have ye
[11:17] do not even the publicans the same
[11:19] and if you salute your you salute your
[11:22] brethren only what do you more than
[11:25] others do not even the public and so
[11:28] be there for perfect even as your father
[11:30] which is in heaven is
[11:32] perfect now we're going to be from that
[11:34] part over to
[11:36] verse
[11:37] 20 of the fifth chapter
[11:41] for i say unto you that except your
[11:43] righteousness shall exceed the
[11:44] righteousness of the scribes and
[11:46] pharisees you shall in no case enter
[11:49] into
[11:50] the kingdom of heaven you may be seated
[11:52] lord that is
[11:54] listening to the
[11:55] reading of the word
[11:57] now
[11:59] we have been
[12:01] on this talking about
[12:04] perfection and what is perfection
[12:07] and how what it takes to make us perfect
[12:09] we've been on this now for
[12:12] uh this makes i think number 10
[12:14] of the messages
[12:16] but
[12:17] we're trying to get a point to you to
[12:19] look at
[12:23] remember our life message we were
[12:24] talking about that
[12:27] the reason that
[12:29] our sins are covered is because that
[12:32] jesus christ died
[12:34] to take our place
[12:36] all right and then dying to take our
[12:38] place
[12:39] then he would impart his life
[12:42] into us
[12:44] and that would be the only way that a
[12:46] human mortal
[12:48] being that is born the way we are
[12:52] you know in sin and walking after the
[12:54] things of life
[12:56] that it would have would take the fact
[12:58] that he would have to come and live in
[13:00] us
[13:02] to give us eternal life
[13:05] and by giving us eternal life then
[13:08] it would be
[13:09] the fact the fact that he would be
[13:12] paying the price right we went through
[13:14] all of the old testament going through
[13:16] and covering how the atonement and what
[13:18] it was for to to offer an atonement and
[13:22] to you know to pay the price of of doing
[13:25] the things but that atonement of the old
[13:27] testament could not set the person free
[13:30] right it could only cover
[13:32] up that person to keep them from being
[13:35] destroyed
[13:36] but then when you come to the new
[13:38] testament jesus christ died once for all
[13:41] and see then he died for all of the sins
[13:43] of the old testament people and for the
[13:45] new testament and bringing it to work
[13:48] that we can see that jesus christ is the
[13:51] answer to all things
[13:52] all right so then we must have the new
[13:54] birth
[13:55] right right if we don't receive that new
[13:57] birthday then we're still just like
[13:59] everybody else
[14:00] we're still under the law
[14:02] he said now the law ended at calvary now
[14:05] the law ends when you're born again
[14:07] right right
[14:08] you're under the law until the time that
[14:10] you've become born again he said but
[14:12] jesus christ paid the price he did
[14:14] he paid the price
[14:16] that he ended the old testament the
[14:18] levitical priesthood the things like
[14:20] that
[14:21] but show me where it ended
[14:23] the fact that we were sinners no
[14:26] that's ended when you received the new
[14:29] you don't receive the new birth then
[14:31] you're still under the law
[14:32] you can say what you want to and think
[14:34] about it it is still there because
[14:36] that's what we're doing
[14:38] all right so we we've talked about our
[14:40] representation
[14:44] now that somebody had to represent us
[14:47] that bumper blood of the old testament
[14:49] just covered
[14:51] the people as i was saying but then when
[14:53] jesus christ came
[14:55] he offered his
[14:56] blood to become a covering for all of us
[15:01] to where it would cover our sins
[15:03] that god does not see us he sees the
[15:06] blood
[15:07] amen but he don't see the world either
[15:10] he sees the blood all right because if
[15:13] not he would have to destroy everything
[15:15] all right so he sees the the blood and
[15:19] that blood is our covering our
[15:21] representation
[15:23] but you know the blood now you're not
[15:25] saved by the blood
[15:29] no all right you're kept saved by the
[15:31] blood
[15:33] you saved by grace through faith by
[15:35] receiving
[15:36] jesus christ into your soul right by a
[15:39] new bird
[15:40] the blood is a covering all right so
[15:43] then you're not saved but you're kept
[15:44] saved by it in other words you're
[15:46] covered right like the old testament was
[15:48] covered
[15:49] the only difference is that this was the
[15:52] blood of gods
[15:54] and there would be more with the new
[15:56] testament because with the blood of god
[15:58] that could come back and cover us
[16:01] he would not only do that but the life
[16:03] that was in the blood
[16:05] would be able to come back upon us to
[16:07] give us eternal life all right so then
[16:10] that we've concluded one thing
[16:14] that's what i'm trying to bring it down
[16:15] to an end on these things and i may have
[16:18] one more message but
[16:21] so we have to to bring it to a point of
[16:23] saying that
[16:24] the only place you can be perfect is in
[16:26] your soul
[16:27] amen
[16:29] by the new birth
[16:30] because your body and your spirit is
[16:32] still in the world
[16:34] we're still subject to the world we're
[16:36] we're tempted
[16:37] and you know the problems of life and
[16:39] we're living right and we're human
[16:42] beings living upon earth and in that
[16:44] then we we realize that we are
[16:48] in a condition that's what paul said he
[16:50] said i'm in a body
[16:53] and they said i'm having troubles with
[16:55] this
[16:56] well that's the way we are we're human
[16:58] beings
[16:59] but we keep looking at the body to try
[17:01] to find perfection
[17:03] and you can't find perfection in the
[17:04] body right
[17:07] there's no way because what would you be
[17:09] looking for
[17:12] what would you find well the greatest
[17:14] person you could find you know you could
[17:16] say i heard our worst grandma she she
[17:19] was a good old lady and i agree
[17:21] she probably was and she really done you
[17:24] a lot of good and took care of you and
[17:25] raised you maybe and stuff like that and
[17:28] taught you a lot of good things but see
[17:31] she wasn't
[17:33] perfect in her body right
[17:36] you know her spirit and body her soul
[17:38] may have been perfect but the rest of
[17:39] her was just like all the rest of us
[17:41] right
[17:42] and got problems all right then in life
[17:45] there's nothing in you and i in this
[17:48] flesh that can be perfect right man
[17:52] but that inward part of us
[17:55] that's it
[17:56] by the new birth the soul can be made
[17:58] perfect
[17:59] because we have god's own life
[18:01] all right now that's what we've been
[18:03] trying to do is try to get us to see
[18:06] that
[18:07] by that new birth
[18:10] that's why you must have the new birth
[18:11] that's why we were listening last night
[18:13] the prophet said
[18:14] that the most important thing in life
[18:17] was that new birth
[18:19] because if we don't have the new birth
[18:21] we're lost
[18:25] it takes that to make it that way so
[18:27] then the only way that we can talk about
[18:29] being perfect is we must first start
[18:32] talking about
[18:33] how that perfection can be imparted unto
[18:36] us by jesus christ coming and living in
[18:39] us right now not a confession right amen
[18:42] we say well i i said that jesus is my
[18:44] savior well has he accepted you
[18:48] has he come to live in your heart
[18:51] if he hasn't come to live in your heart
[18:53] then
[18:54] the salvation has done you know good
[18:56] right man all right
[18:58] but the only those that are truly born
[19:00] again can say that they're perfect in
[19:02] their their soul they're being
[19:05] the world's not perfect there's no way
[19:07] to make it perfect right seeing god
[19:10] wants to come and live in you and give
[19:12] you his own life amen now we're going to
[19:14] pick up a little more on that this
[19:16] afternoon
[19:17] and a little thought to go with it but i
[19:19] want you to just
[19:21] listen and and pay attention this
[19:23] morning to what we're trying to talk
[19:25] about
[19:26] and we're going to use a lot of
[19:27] scripture now i didn't give these to
[19:29] them because it would take so much time
[19:31] trying to run them up
[19:33] and do it but i want you to to just look
[19:35] and see
[19:38] because the law
[19:41] could make nothing perfect
[19:45] it's always bringing out their wednesday
[19:47] if the law could make perfect then the
[19:49] levitical priesthood would have remained
[19:52] right that's right because that was
[19:54] where the law was given to the people
[19:56] right was under the
[19:58] levitical you know the the the
[20:00] priesthood back in the old testament all
[20:02] right so there was a necessity that
[20:05] there had to be another priesthood
[20:07] paul says
[20:08] all right and he'd have to be after the
[20:10] order of melchizedek
[20:12] which is the power of an endless life
[20:14] and not just a carnal
[20:16] person like right levitical priesthood
[20:18] like heroncy he had his problems
[20:22] but when he went behind that veil he had
[20:24] to be dressed right done right act right
[20:26] for that point
[20:28] to take care of him right and it was god
[20:31] making the atonement
[20:33] but see then jesus christ came with the
[20:35] tri not of the of the tribe of levi
[20:39] he came from the tribe of judah
[20:41] because it was promised judah
[20:44] not promising the levitical priesthood
[20:46] but promised judah that the lawgiver
[20:49] would come between his knees in other
[20:50] words would come from him
[20:52] from the tribe of judah and that was a
[20:54] promise in the bible so jesus had to
[20:56] come from the tribe of judah
[20:58] in what would be the natural thing of
[21:00] life now we know that he was almighty
[21:02] god
[21:04] then the lineage if you run your lineage
[21:07] you run a lineage by only following the
[21:09] male lineage
[21:11] all right so then it would come over to
[21:13] speak of joseph
[21:16] and joseph was not the father of jesus
[21:20] but that's just your law your your line
[21:22] of lineage isn't coming down
[21:24] if you're going to run anything we
[21:25] better run into mary but that would work
[21:28] either because she was not the the
[21:30] mother of god
[21:32] she was only an incubator that was hard
[21:34] of god because the virgin birth god
[21:36] created both egg and germ and which
[21:39] words sperms and things you want to use
[21:42] he created those and placed it in the
[21:44] wound of mary
[21:45] and she was not brother the mother of
[21:47] god jesus never called her mother he
[21:49] called a woman right amen all right
[21:52] but you see then he made a way
[21:54] to worry that he could could do that but
[21:57] the law could not do anything to you and
[21:59] i
[22:00] he would only condemn us
[22:02] all right if that's what we think about
[22:04] it today
[22:05] that the bible and the the prophet's
[22:08] message and the things we believe
[22:10] that it's still a bunch of rules then
[22:13] you're still under the law
[22:15] paul said to let her kill it
[22:19] no i'm a born again christian but i
[22:20] thank you no i think you are to be born
[22:23] again
[22:24] right if you're born again you'll live
[22:26] right right if you don't live right
[22:28] you're not born again is that sensible
[22:31] that doesn't need a big hammer of
[22:32] hitting you over the head to get you to
[22:34] see a light bulb does it
[22:35] that's just blind sense
[22:38] if i live like the devil then i am the
[22:40] devil
[22:41] the the one that's motivating me is the
[22:43] one that's that's taken care of all
[22:45] right but see in my body and my spirit
[22:48] i'm still part of the old curse of
[22:50] natural life
[22:53] i'm still under that curse of natural
[22:55] life
[22:56] i have to eat i have to drink i have to
[22:59] sleep
[23:00] right i have to work
[23:03] i have to do all these things why
[23:05] because i'm still under that part of
[23:07] life
[23:09] and see that but that
[23:11] part inside of me that soul which is
[23:13] perfect
[23:14] the law could never make the comer
[23:17] perfect it could only cover him
[23:21] right you can make an atonement for him
[23:24] all right now i hope that don't fall on
[23:27] your death ears to not remember all i've
[23:29] tried to preach about it
[23:31] because it says noah was perfect and job
[23:33] was perfect right because they made the
[23:36] atonement
[23:37] not because they could have eternal life
[23:40] because they could not have it under the
[23:42] old testament because jesus christ had
[23:44] not died
[23:45] all right that's right your new
[23:46] testament brings in the eternal life
[23:49] okay so now in doing that then we look
[23:52] at it see that my soul is the perfect
[23:54] part of me
[23:56] but my body and my spirit is still
[23:58] subject to the life
[24:00] but which one i yield to
[24:03] like the story was told you know about
[24:05] the the black dog white dog in the old
[24:07] end and said after me born again
[24:09] yeah white dog black dog
[24:11] all right
[24:12] he said which one wins chief he said the
[24:14] one i feed the most
[24:16] all right
[24:17] now if we feed this old body and spirit
[24:20] and live after the world then we've got
[24:22] a problem but if we let that inward man
[24:24] lead us then he can lead us to the lord
[24:27] all right but now by the law
[24:30] by the works and the things of keeping
[24:32] the law
[24:33] it could not make you perfect because
[24:35] there was nothing that could come within
[24:37] the individual
[24:39] it could make you perfect in the basis
[24:41] of covering you
[24:43] that god would be looking down and not
[24:45] seeing you
[24:46] and would call you a perfect man
[24:48] but it could not get inside of you to
[24:50] give you eternal life
[24:52] so then that would come up let's just
[24:53] start with a few scriptures let's go to
[24:55] galatians 2
[24:57] and let's take a few scriptures and just
[24:59] go through this
[25:01] and and look at it
[25:03] and we're going to read a lot of
[25:04] scriptures with if we have the time to
[25:08] to look at galatians 2
[25:11] and 16.
[25:17] knowing that a man is not justified by
[25:19] the works of the law
[25:21] but by the faith of jesus christ
[25:25] even we have believed in jesus christ
[25:29] that we might be justified by the faith
[25:31] of christ
[25:33] now you hear what he's saying right
[25:37] and not by the works of the law
[25:39] for by the works of the law shall no
[25:42] flesh
[25:42] be justified
[25:45] so that the best we could do in life
[25:48] in the flesh
[25:50] life living
[25:52] the best we could do
[25:54] is not the perfection that
[25:56] is required of matthew 5 48
[26:00] because it says therefore be therefore
[26:02] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[26:04] perfect
[26:05] all right then we read matthew 5 20
[26:08] unless your righteousness
[26:11] so righteousness and perfection will
[26:13] have to go together unless your
[26:15] righteousness exceeds the righteousness
[26:17] of the scribes and pharisees you won't
[26:19] enter
[26:20] but because that's that's the basis all
[26:23] right then that's the conditions it's
[26:25] placed upon
[26:26] to where we got to look at it so there's
[26:28] no way that you and i
[26:30] can have any concept i know wednesday
[26:32] night was probably the hardest message
[26:34] on me physically
[26:36] to try to preach because of trying my
[26:38] best to lay it down
[26:41] to get you to look at it
[26:43] because
[26:45] it's automatically within the human race
[26:47] that we think that
[26:49] god saved us because of something we've
[26:51] done or didn't know that's right
[26:54] and that's basically what's been taught
[26:56] to us down through life
[26:58] that's right
[26:59] and like i told you even in that message
[27:01] don't go tell your children
[27:03] don't teach your children of a mean old
[27:06] god
[27:08] that hates them for doing things
[27:11] tell them about the love of jesus christ
[27:14] to come and save them
[27:16] don't tell them god hates them because
[27:18] see they're going to remember that
[27:19] that's right that's right and what we've
[27:22] been taught in life is what motivates us
[27:25] we've been told all our life this is the
[27:26] right hand
[27:27] how do we know
[27:31] we've been told about horses horses are
[27:32] not measured by these are measured by
[27:34] hand whose hands
[27:39] according to some people's hand it'd be
[27:41] a shetland pony
[27:44] but according to brother hardline's hand
[27:47] if you remember him
[27:50] you'd have to get a ladder to get up
[27:51] onto the step to get onto the stirrup
[27:53] you know
[27:56] see we've been taught all of our life
[27:57] certain things
[27:59] amen and we've been we've been
[28:01] programmed
[28:04] and we've been been beat with a word
[28:07] to try to scare us into salvation
[28:10] right
[28:11] because we've been told you're gonna die
[28:12] go to hell for doing that
[28:16] right right
[28:17] and that dwells within us and then we
[28:18] come up and we say well brother dale i
[28:20] don't believe that no more
[28:22] i'm going to take a lie detector's test
[28:25] and see if it still ticks inside of us
[28:28] right because it does
[28:30] it's still there behind us is what i'm
[28:33] trying to get across wednesday we we
[28:35] still try to have some reason that we
[28:38] were saved something that we was good i
[28:41] remember reading about a gangster one
[28:43] time
[28:44] and
[28:45] you know he was a murderer he was all
[28:46] kind of things
[28:48] but he had one thing that he wouldn't do
[28:52] he wouldn't sell
[28:53] children's pornography never how you say
[28:56] those
[28:56] words because his wife didn't want it to
[28:59] be done
[29:02] well you know what he'd probably go up
[29:03] to judgment one day and he said
[29:06] well you know i didn't sell pornography
[29:10] it'd always be something that we want to
[29:12] try to deal with god about that i didn't
[29:15] do this or didn't do that right
[29:17] i've done this to the rich young ruler
[29:19] come on
[29:20] the rich young ruler said i've done
[29:22] these things for my youth i've kept the
[29:24] commandments right
[29:27] but jesus said you like one thing
[29:29] paul said
[29:31] concerning the law blameless
[29:34] he said the things i thought was life i
[29:37] found to be dead
[29:40] see paul was the legalist we call him
[29:42] today
[29:45] and that's what people think today and
[29:46] that's what i was trying to get across
[29:48] the prophet of god said when you women
[29:50] don't think cause you got long hair and
[29:51] long addresses and things right
[29:54] that's going to make you safe
[29:58] that's right and don't save you
[30:01] it's good and commendable it ought to be
[30:03] done
[30:04] right amen why because the word we
[30:07] follow in the word
[30:09] but it's not going to save us
[30:12] we're saved by grace through faith
[30:15] but it's said well again we wouldn't be
[30:16] saved by the blood
[30:18] we're kept saved by the blood that's
[30:20] right the life had to come out of that
[30:23] blood and it wasn't the life of of
[30:26] running through the veins
[30:28] of jesus that saves us you know that
[30:31] form of life
[30:33] it was the soul out of the individual
[30:35] right right
[30:38] you're alive that's why it's your whole
[30:39] witness we're talking about like that
[30:40] they won't take a blood transfusion
[30:42] because they believe the light is in the
[30:44] blood so if i give brother collie a
[30:46] transfusion then he's got some of my
[30:48] life
[30:50] that's what they believe
[30:51] right but see that's not true
[30:54] amen that's right see jesus christ could
[30:56] give you a blood transfusion but that
[30:58] wouldn't save you
[31:00] that's right because that's not the life
[31:02] that it comes it's the soul of the
[31:04] individual
[31:06] right
[31:07] that gave that gives us eternal life
[31:11] that's why in soul we're eternal perfect
[31:13] righteous
[31:15] but in our body and spirit we're still
[31:17] out here in the human realm
[31:19] well we're dealing with those things
[31:20] right
[31:21] all right he said well
[31:23] why do you have to preach to us about it
[31:26] well the reason is because we still let
[31:28] that reasoning factor
[31:31] controllers to the basis of saying well
[31:34] i i i i was i just didn't do this and
[31:38] that saved me no
[31:40] that's right
[31:41] you can't be good enough to be saved
[31:45] and don't worry about being lost you're
[31:46] born that way right
[31:48] don't worry about how what you've done
[31:50] caused you to be lost now what we've
[31:52] done in our lives didn't cause it to be
[31:53] lost right
[31:55] we lost because of our representation
[31:57] back in the beginning that put us in the
[31:59] world of sin
[32:02] see that's what i was trying to bring
[32:03] wednesday night and it was just it's
[32:05] hard on me because it was a it was a
[32:07] burden to try to express it because
[32:10] you said well brother dale none of us
[32:12] here believes that man well maybe it's
[32:13] me then
[32:16] you know maybe i'll talk about myself
[32:18] right
[32:20] because you see we always want some way
[32:24] well i didn't do that
[32:26] i i'm not like
[32:28] other people
[32:32] i i never did drunk
[32:36] well glory that makes a good alcoholics
[32:38] anonymous person
[32:41] but then you say let us sin that grace
[32:43] be about paul said god forbid
[32:46] come on
[32:47] that's why it's so hard because you try
[32:49] to preach the truth and people's mind
[32:51] will lead you to the wrong way
[32:55] could i don't say well let's go out and
[32:56] sin that god may save us
[32:59] right paul said god forbid
[33:02] amen
[33:03] to get that garbage can out of your mind
[33:06] i believe in being born again amen right
[33:08] amen that's right
[33:10] and then the life will follow the
[33:12] morning to get experience if not then
[33:13] you're not born again
[33:17] so i get on that i'm sitting back on
[33:19] wednesday nights but all right
[33:24] by
[33:24] putting his own life
[33:27] within me that's what it couldn't be
[33:29] done under that old testament
[33:32] there was no way for that life to be
[33:34] able to come back into that believer
[33:38] right but in the new testament
[33:42] the life coming into the believer by the
[33:44] new birth
[33:45] in my soul
[33:46] and it makes me then
[33:48] come on
[33:50] just as righteous as he is amen
[33:53] and just as perfect as he looks why
[33:56] because paul said it's not i that liveth
[33:58] right
[33:59] right but christ that liveth in me amen
[34:02] so i'm not talking about my perfection
[34:04] right
[34:07] you know the scripture over our
[34:08] righteousness is what
[34:11] filthy rags
[34:14] the best we can do isaiah i believe it
[34:16] is called it filthy rags
[34:20] you say well don't you think we're to
[34:21] live good
[34:23] if you're a christian you will live good
[34:27] if not
[34:29] what does it matter what you do
[34:34] that's why it's so hard for people to
[34:35] understand brother ryan when he would
[34:37] would preach and say that sin is not
[34:39] drinking gambling smoking running around
[34:41] with women that's not sin right all
[34:43] right that's right
[34:45] lady finally said one day well
[34:47] tell me what is sin
[34:49] he says unbelief
[34:53] he said you do those things because
[34:55] you're an unbeliever
[34:58] those are attributes of sin right sin is
[35:02] unbelief
[35:05] and we're listening last night we're
[35:06] brought around and brought it down to
[35:07] where the lady just doubted
[35:10] this doubted something that was said
[35:13] he said see that is sin
[35:18] that's an unbelief he said
[35:21] like i've always told you
[35:23] we've been in there in in the scripture
[35:25] where we was reading in exodus
[35:27] they sent 10 times from the time they
[35:29] left egypt to get into cadiz barnett
[35:32] right
[35:35] and god was still going to take them to
[35:36] the lane that's right
[35:38] but when they come back with a false
[35:40] report and wouldn't believe that god was
[35:43] able to take them in and capture the
[35:45] land
[35:46] then they went back to the wilderness
[35:47] for 40 years
[35:49] that was their unbelief god can put up
[35:51] with a lot of things but when it comes
[35:53] to unbelief
[35:55] don't lie and make fun of nobody that's
[35:57] not right
[35:58] all right
[35:59] now
[36:01] now the one try one thing that i've
[36:02] tried to make in this service this
[36:04] series of series
[36:07] that you and i
[36:09] must
[36:10] say what god says
[36:14] amen
[36:17] that's not what i say it's not what you
[36:19] say right
[36:21] in my eyes you will never be perfect
[36:27] but in your eyes i never will be perfect
[36:29] right
[36:31] so that solves the problem
[36:36] there's no such thing as a perfect human
[36:37] being in flesh and and things because
[36:40] of life that we live in
[36:43] because the bible says anything in our
[36:44] faith is sin
[36:47] well you eat too much
[36:50] blood pressure goes up
[36:52] problems do we kill ourselves
[36:56] but get the point now
[36:59] i've tried to make it over and over and
[37:01] over and over to you we've got to say
[37:03] what god says right amen all right
[37:06] so he says now matthew 5 48
[37:09] for be therefore perfect even as your
[37:12] father in heaven is perfect
[37:15] that's a requirement right that's it
[37:19] okay right then we read in matthew 5 20
[37:24] that except your righteousness
[37:26] shall exceed
[37:28] the righteousness of the scribes and
[37:30] mercies
[37:32] you'll not enter heaven
[37:35] two things facing us
[37:39] two condemnations right right
[37:43] now
[37:44] the scribes and pharisees
[37:46] especially the pharisees
[37:48] i told you why i believe that scribes is
[37:50] placed in there because that would just
[37:52] cover everybody then
[37:54] you know life because it would generally
[37:56] say pharisees and sadducees you know
[38:00] we see the to the pharisee paul said i'm
[38:03] blameless
[38:05] according to the law
[38:07] he said i'm a pharisee of the pharisees
[38:09] and hebrew the hebrew blameless
[38:10] according to the law okay
[38:12] now
[38:15] did that save him
[38:17] he said that's what it's killing him
[38:19] right
[38:19] exactly amen
[38:24] now look at it
[38:26] you say that was a man that according to
[38:28] the law was blindless
[38:32] you know what the high priest
[38:34] if he wasn't blameless
[38:36] he got killed that's right that's right
[38:41] you had to go behind the veil right
[38:42] right
[38:44] is he went in there anything he had to
[38:47] have the bible just the blood for his
[38:50] own sins
[38:52] and the sins for others
[38:54] it wasn't just for the sins of others
[38:56] it's for his own sins
[38:58] he had to enter their him right and
[39:00] offer that atonement everything had to
[39:02] be right
[39:04] but what about trying to compare with a
[39:06] man that according to the law is perfect
[39:12] according to the law paul was righteous
[39:15] because righteousness and righteous and
[39:17] all
[39:18] it just deals from the word right
[39:21] and the word right is where you start
[39:22] from and the word writing just simply
[39:25] means you're not guilty right
[39:27] right
[39:29] you're not guilty
[39:30] that's the best definition of right
[39:34] and to be righteous
[39:37] means that in your life
[39:41] you have not been guilty
[39:44] that we come out to righteous
[39:47] because you're not guilty all right
[39:50] then in righteousness
[39:53] it would come out to the point of
[39:55] talking about
[39:58] a human being living in life
[40:01] as a perfection let's pull that up
[40:03] brother jones so we can read it
[40:06] the definition
[40:11] on the word righteous
[40:16] just the state of him who is as he ought
[40:18] to be i like that
[40:22] righteous the condition acceptable to
[40:25] god
[40:27] that's a doctrine concerning the way in
[40:29] which man may attain and stay approved
[40:31] of god
[40:32] it means integrity virtue purity of life
[40:35] righteousness correctness of correctness
[40:38] of thinking feeling and acting
[40:41] and in our sense just are the virtue
[40:44] which gives each his due
[40:47] all right
[40:48] now
[40:49] righteousness
[40:51] just the state of fact of not being
[40:54] guilty
[40:57] coming from the word right
[41:02] now
[41:03] perfect would be the same definition
[41:05] right
[41:08] i may use a word different all but it's
[41:10] basically the same definition
[41:12] it just simply means that you've never
[41:15] done it
[41:16] right
[41:18] now
[41:20] under the old testament atonement
[41:22] when that atonement was made god looked
[41:25] down and said noah is perfect
[41:28] right
[41:30] you can say he was righteous right
[41:35] why because he wasn't guilty right
[41:41] justification is one
[41:45] we don't have time to cover the three
[41:46] stages wade was doing a good job the
[41:48] other night on it
[41:49] but justification means you chopped off
[41:52] your five sins
[41:54] all right then you'll never have to
[41:55] answer for that
[41:59] you get condemned in your heart and you
[42:01] pray out god forgive me
[42:03] of my sins
[42:05] and you know what
[42:06] you may die and go to hell for what you
[42:08] do after them all right
[42:10] but you're not gonna die and go to hell
[42:11] for what you've done let me forgive you
[42:14] right
[42:14] yes sir
[42:17] so the word just
[42:20] the word right
[42:22] the word perfect
[42:23] it's all coming to the same meaning
[42:26] you're not guilty right
[42:28] amen
[42:30] so if the blood was the atonement even
[42:32] brother brown said
[42:34] i cannot
[42:36] bring up things people has done
[42:40] in their lives
[42:41] if they've repented right
[42:44] sure
[42:45] amen
[42:46] he said we're calling this gun
[42:49] now you know what i can though
[42:51] didn't you
[42:54] i don't i look at you and i can
[42:58] you see when we're looking at it from
[42:59] god's eyes
[43:01] you see how everything's different
[43:04] all right
[43:04] now
[43:08] there's a lot said in the bible about
[43:10] righteousness and i don't have time to
[43:11] cover all of it but we'll just run
[43:13] through a few scriptures and and do but
[43:16] let's start with them with a statement
[43:18] brother brown made
[43:21] from the church age book revelation of
[43:23] jesus christ number one
[43:29] now i want you to read this
[43:32] i want you to think about what he's
[43:34] saying
[43:38] think about what he's saying now
[43:43] no man knows the things of god save the
[43:45] spirit of god and he to whom the spirit
[43:47] of god reveals them
[43:48] we need to call on god for revelation
[43:51] more than anything else in the world and
[43:54] watch
[43:55] we have accepted the bible that's right
[43:58] see we swear by it yes sir this is god's
[44:01] word blood's worth right here he said
[44:02] holy bible in front of it
[44:04] we believe it
[44:06] yep
[44:08] but has it been revealed that's right
[44:11] so what do you say
[44:12] we have accepted the truth of it
[44:16] but it's still not real to most people
[44:19] because the revelation by the spirit is
[44:21] not dire that's right
[44:23] so now we need the revelation about the
[44:25] spirit more than anything else right do
[44:27] you ever pray for a revelation amen
[44:30] you ever pray for god to reveal
[44:31] something to you
[44:34] you know i'm just honest and that you
[44:36] know how i study so you listen to what
[44:38] i'm saying if you stop studying so much
[44:40] and start asking god to help you right
[44:43] right
[44:44] because you ain't gonna study yourself
[44:45] into it that's correct now understand
[44:48] that one i didn't say not to study
[44:52] the bible says study to show yourself
[44:54] approved
[44:57] i said what we do a lot of time you know
[44:58] what we do a lot of times
[45:01] you won't run around i give you this
[45:03] quote you know that we spend a lot of
[45:05] time crying out before god when we ought
[45:07] to pray for a while and sit down and
[45:09] listen
[45:10] and see whether he wants to speak to us
[45:11] or not you want that quote
[45:14] right
[45:15] he said we want to sit down sometimes
[45:17] and listen
[45:20] said we do all the talking that's right
[45:25] come on
[45:29] you know that old pharisee standing
[45:31] there lord i thank you
[45:33] i'm not like this guy over here i fast i
[45:36] do everything i kept the law to the
[45:38] letter
[45:41] man over on the other side and just
[45:43] barely about his head and said god
[45:44] forgive me i'm a sinner the bible said
[45:47] which my own justified that's right
[45:50] which did god count to be righteous
[45:54] all right so we need a revelation more
[45:56] than anything
[45:58] see
[46:00] the revelation by the spirit is not
[46:02] there the word has not been quickly now
[46:04] look at the scriptures he goes right to
[46:08] to tell us has not been quitted
[46:11] look
[46:13] the bible says in ii corinthians 5 21
[46:16] that we have become the righteousness of
[46:18] god by our union with jesus christ
[46:24] did you get it it says that we are the
[46:27] very righteousness of god himself by
[46:29] being in christ
[46:31] it says that he jesus became sin for us
[46:34] does not say became sinful but became
[46:36] sin for us that we by our union with him
[46:40] we might become to
[46:41] come the righteousness of god now watch
[46:44] it
[46:44] if we accept the fact
[46:48] what
[46:49] if we accept the fact that he died for
[46:51] us
[46:55] now is anybody in here going to reject
[46:57] that he died for you if you do you got a
[46:59] problem with your peanut brain
[47:01] right let alone
[47:03] needing salvation
[47:07] but
[47:08] look if we accept the fact
[47:12] that he became sin for us our
[47:13] substitution
[47:15] all right
[47:17] we've got to accept what he says about
[47:19] us to accept the one is to accept the
[47:22] other
[47:23] now we know the bible says that
[47:25] it can't be denied but the revelation of
[47:27] it is missing it's not real to the
[47:29] majority of god's children
[47:32] it is just a good verse in the bible but
[47:34] we need to have it made alive that will
[47:37] take revelation now there was a
[47:40] scripture
[47:41] in the things
[47:43] that i was sitting in the deer stand
[47:45] listening to brother branham
[47:47] on my ipod and
[47:49] that's what struck me and i preached
[47:51] this about perfection
[47:55] i mean knowing this would eventually
[47:57] come
[47:58] yeah preach perfection
[48:00] nine sermons
[48:02] to talk about it
[48:04] if we accept the fact that jesus christ
[48:06] died for us right right
[48:09] now do we accept that fact amen that's
[48:11] right
[48:13] dude we don't ain't no problem right
[48:14] right
[48:15] but it was except the fact that he died
[48:18] for us amen
[48:20] then we must accept the fact that he
[48:23] by coming into us by a union you know
[48:27] by the new birth he's made us just as
[48:30] righteous as he is
[48:33] all amen
[48:34] well then why do we say we're not right
[48:37] well there's no good i'm not perfect
[48:39] you're not perfect ain't nobody perfect
[48:44] the bible says you
[48:46] are the bible said noah was and he died
[48:49] of drunk
[48:51] that's right
[48:56] come on
[48:57] when are we gonna say what god says
[48:59] right
[49:09] does it matter how sick you are
[49:12] that's what everybody thinks well oh
[49:13] yeah
[49:14] i agree with it if i'm healed
[49:17] no
[49:18] you'll never be healed that way
[49:20] right
[49:21] you've got to say you're healed
[49:23] believe you're healed
[49:24] ask god for a revelation that you're
[49:26] healed and even after he reveals it to
[49:29] you he didn't say when he'd take it away
[49:31] that's right
[49:36] the prophet of god said that healing is
[49:37] not eternal he said thereby you can lose
[49:40] it yep
[49:45] even though he has spoken unto you
[49:47] and revealed it unto you and wait a
[49:49] second brother if he's revealed to him
[49:51] he'll come no wait a minute
[49:54] your prophet said the same unbelief same
[49:58] faith you took it away same unbelief
[49:59] will bring it back that's right
[50:02] all right man
[50:04] you doubt what god says
[50:06] you can lose your healing that's right
[50:08] that's right i don't agree with you
[50:10] dying people say that's okay you go
[50:12] ahead and do what you want to that's
[50:13] what i'm telling you i believe right
[50:15] because that's how strong i believe it
[50:18] and you can't lose your salvation
[50:20] because it's eternal amen
[50:22] that's right
[50:24] but if your justification and
[50:25] sanctification
[50:27] coming unto salvation you can lose every
[50:29] bit of it right and dying go to hell
[50:31] absolutely amen
[50:33] miss the whole time right all right
[50:37] we see healing is on the basis of the
[50:39] fact that your confession keeps making
[50:41] it right
[50:45] now
[50:48] to think about that then
[50:52] we need to be saying what god says
[50:56] right amen amen he says we're perfect
[50:58] right he says we're righteous
[51:02] at least
[51:03] we could say what he
[51:06] all says
[51:08] but then we turn on so i just don't see
[51:10] nobody else well michael feller said you
[51:13] know when everybody left his church with
[51:15] nothing but him and his wife and he's
[51:17] looking over at her one day you know and
[51:18] he said
[51:20] i'm beginning to wonder about thou now
[51:24] so
[51:29] if god's word is true
[51:33] where's the problem with us saying right
[51:35] right
[51:37] but you know i've talked with people
[51:38] even here
[51:41] that i know your thoughts
[51:44] i don't want to confess that i'm healed
[51:47] because i might not be and i'd be a liar
[51:51] no you just born money anyway
[51:54] don't worry about it
[51:56] you born one
[51:57] just forget it
[52:01] don't ever try to figure out where
[52:03] you're a liar or not you're born one
[52:04] right i ain't never lied in my life
[52:06] jack cole said you're the biggest liar
[52:08] here
[52:10] that lady said you know my tongue i want
[52:12] to lay it on the altar he said lady
[52:14] it's alright but 14 foot and ain't
[52:16] enough room for your tongue
[52:21] you think brother that was hard
[52:25] but how can we ever talk
[52:28] think about right
[52:29] as a human mortal of being righteous
[52:31] that's correct
[52:34] see we've got to depend upon what he's
[52:36] done
[52:39] our dependence cannot be upon anything
[52:41] of our lives
[52:44] well i didn't do this or i didn't do
[52:46] that see you've been taught that all
[52:48] your life that's why you're you're still
[52:50] thinking right
[52:52] you've been taught that you didn't do
[52:54] this and that makes you good makes you
[52:56] good neighbor that's that we're gonna
[52:58] make you a christian that's right amen
[53:06] if you check in your bible i don't say
[53:08] it now ago you say let's end it god and
[53:11] that we might be saying god forbid paul
[53:12] said but if you'll check your record
[53:14] you'll find out the biggest portion of
[53:16] those at our site are those that have
[53:18] went out in the world and done a lot
[53:20] wrong
[53:22] because it's hard to get a lot of old
[53:23] good old self-righteous hypocrites
[53:26] saved
[53:29] right
[53:31] paul would say i didn't do them things
[53:35] but he said that's my enemy that's
[53:37] killing me
[53:39] i can say i didn't drink i didn't do
[53:41] this i didn't do that
[53:45] that's my enemy right
[53:48] you think it ain't what it is when we
[53:50] come in this message there was a lot of
[53:52] legalists still are a lot
[53:55] but a lot of them taught if you didn't
[53:56] drink you didn't smoke you didn't chew
[53:58] you didn't run around women then
[54:00] you was capable of being saved
[54:03] i said well i didn't do that anyway
[54:08] a lot of it i did now but
[54:11] i said that make me save
[54:17] you see i was told i saved when i knew i
[54:19] would
[54:21] when you're in the message
[54:23] yours yes
[54:26] you're in the message you believe it
[54:27] don't you everything wrote around says
[54:30] that don't mean you're saved that's
[54:32] right that's right
[54:33] devil believes everything he says right
[54:35] inside me
[54:37] knows a whole lot more about him we do
[54:38] he had the computer before we did
[54:42] let's just go back why he was dealing
[54:44] with abraham let's go back there and
[54:46] just read that where he was at in
[54:48] genesis 15.
[54:51] and enjoy this
[54:53] services he he done
[54:56] while he was gone
[54:58] hope you did
[55:00] maybe he'll get around to finishing it
[55:01] up
[55:05] matter of fact he do it wednesday
[55:14] genesis 15 and 6 is what
[55:22] right
[55:24] and he believed in the lord
[55:27] and he counted it to him for
[55:29] righteousness
[55:34] now we get on this evening about the
[55:36] imputing of sin but we don't deal very
[55:38] much about
[55:39] counting or imputing righteousness
[55:44] we want to impute sin
[55:47] we don't like to talk about imputing
[55:49] righteousness right or counting because
[55:52] that's the same word impute reckon count
[55:55] is the same word right
[55:59] so what was it that would be about
[56:00] abraham
[56:04] that would make god
[56:07] count it as righteousness
[56:10] he believed it
[56:14] that's right now i've always told you
[56:16] and i believed it
[56:18] see a lot of people think well abraham's
[56:19] the only one god come down and deal with
[56:20] no
[56:21] the prophet of god said every person in
[56:24] the world
[56:26] paraphrasing shorten the story of every
[56:28] person in the world
[56:31] has got that same ability
[56:34] he said no that ain't according to
[56:35] so-and-so because he taught you see i
[56:37] don't care what he told me
[56:40] i'm telling you what the bible says what
[56:41] the prophet said you can deal whatever
[56:43] joe said yourself
[56:49] we think that
[56:51] abraham was a certain kind of a good guy
[56:55] and that's what made god deal with him
[56:58] why can't you see that god would deal
[56:59] with all mankind
[57:03] it makes it greater for me to understand
[57:05] it this way that god would deal with
[57:08] everybody
[57:10] you know in some way or the other right
[57:13] amen right
[57:15] but abraham believed it
[57:18] well you know everybody wants to make it
[57:19] some country
[57:21] abram believed
[57:23] that's the greatest of all i could ever
[57:24] think about that's right you know what
[57:26] everybody else didn't believe me
[57:29] like i've always told you jesus was seen
[57:31] of over 500 brethren
[57:34] after his resurrection
[57:37] come on read your bible
[57:41] but only 120 of them believed him
[57:44] that's right
[57:46] because the others wasn't in the upper
[57:47] room
[57:49] 20120 believed him
[57:52] 380 didn't believe it
[57:54] oh they believe what he said yeah they
[57:56] seen him the hell he made handling me oh
[57:58] yeah
[58:00] but they didn't make it leopard right
[58:04] what is so great about abraham
[58:07] you know that some people
[58:09] can't believe
[58:11] that's right
[58:13] sure i've told you over and over there's
[58:15] no guy used to work here at the plant my
[58:17] name was dozer
[58:19] and he told brother mo one day he said
[58:21] why they didn't go out up to the moon
[58:24] that's when i turned the desert
[58:27] well if he's able to fly up and go out
[58:29] in the desert
[58:30] why couldn't he do a little more
[58:31] horsepower flying out but you know
[58:35] but that's why he couldn't believe it
[58:41] abraham believed god
[58:44] amen
[58:47] what did he have any different
[58:53] come on read your bible
[58:55] he leaves air he goes he does all
[58:57] because of what some
[58:59] thought came in his mind
[59:02] did you hear it did he hear an audible
[59:04] voice i don't know
[59:09] you know did god come down with an
[59:11] audible voice and talk to him i don't
[59:12] know and you don't either so no problem
[59:15] with it
[59:17] because it doesn't record
[59:19] it just said the lord spoke to abram
[59:20] right
[59:22] he believed
[59:27] he kept on telling anything he kept
[59:29] believing it
[59:31] that's right
[59:35] people told me says brother there you
[59:36] just believe too much of what people say
[59:39] well until you've just proved you're a
[59:41] liar i'm gonna believe what you're
[59:42] saying
[59:44] but then when it's proven you're a liar
[59:45] and you're the liar not me
[59:51] some people just can't believe that's
[59:53] right man
[59:55] a lot of voices
[59:56] don't you think that satan could have
[59:58] talked to abram too sure
[1:00:03] you know what i love about it and we
[1:00:04] talked about telling my wife the other
[1:00:06] day when wade was preaching on
[1:00:09] something that kept on trying and we
[1:00:10] illustrated his abram abram may remain
[1:00:12] but you get over new testament they
[1:00:14] never use the word abram
[1:00:16] they were used in the new testament
[1:00:18] right
[1:00:22] once he got his name changed and never
[1:00:23] used no more
[1:00:25] right not in the bible no more that is
[1:00:27] abram used abraham
[1:00:29] but never was using the new testament
[1:00:34] because that's where god looks at mine
[1:00:37] so he believed
[1:00:42] in god
[1:00:43] you believe what god said
[1:00:46] he goes through all of it you can take
[1:00:48] it to each one of the stages that he
[1:00:50] goes through
[1:00:51] you know
[1:00:52] he believed him
[1:00:56] well if i just hear the voice of god i
[1:00:58] believe it
[1:01:00] that's what i said how many people did
[1:01:01] he talk to in that day right amen
[1:01:06] how many people today is god talking to
[1:01:13] it
[1:01:14] right
[1:01:18] judas believed right
[1:01:20] right
[1:01:22] then he quit believing yes
[1:01:25] right that's it
[1:01:29] the bible says there in a lot of it
[1:01:30] decisions and
[1:01:32] the people believed
[1:01:36] all right
[1:01:37] i believed it
[1:01:39] those that had the belly full of fish
[1:01:41] and loads they believed he could
[1:01:43] multiply food
[1:01:47] well maybe the next chapter is ready to
[1:01:48] kill him right right
[1:01:51] because it didn't bring me some more
[1:01:52] food and fish you know right yeah
[1:01:55] but you understand what i'm saying
[1:01:59] when i was in the baptist i used to
[1:02:01] argue with the baptist because the
[1:02:03] badgers say well you you
[1:02:05] if you believe you're saved
[1:02:07] i said that ain't bible
[1:02:09] and i told them that when i was there i
[1:02:10] didn't get along with them it's good no
[1:02:12] more than i do here
[1:02:14] i said that's not the bible
[1:02:17] the bible said he that believeth
[1:02:31] you know what abraham done he just kept
[1:02:32] on believing believe it every time god
[1:02:35] would talk to him it got greater he got
[1:02:37] more sure until he finally even met god
[1:02:45] but he was a believer or he wouldn't
[1:02:47] have never met him there you know right
[1:02:51] so what is the secret of becoming
[1:02:52] righteous
[1:02:55] right
[1:02:57] are you listening
[1:02:59] what is the secret of being perfect
[1:03:04] to believe what god says
[1:03:07] right
[1:03:08] yeah we're going to get on something
[1:03:10] this afternoon because
[1:03:11] you know
[1:03:13] i'm going to just preach my heart out on
[1:03:14] one thing
[1:03:18] where it said about david blesses a man
[1:03:19] to whom god will not impute sin i want
[1:03:22] you to think about that until this
[1:03:23] afternoon and i want you to tell me who
[1:03:25] that man is
[1:03:27] right and i'm not talking about jesus
[1:03:29] the man
[1:03:32] i'm talking about i want to know who
[1:03:34] that man is right
[1:03:37] that god will not impute sin
[1:03:42] when we covered it last night in the
[1:03:43] bible study then we're going to give an
[1:03:45] account of the deeds done in the body
[1:03:50] brother brown had to preach marriage and
[1:03:52] divorce correct all right
[1:03:59] who is it
[1:04:02] just write it down give it to me
[1:04:07] is this great seed doctrine is it this
[1:04:09] great this or is it because you this
[1:04:11] from you so good
[1:04:13] right now
[1:04:14] who is that man
[1:04:17] that god won't impute sin
[1:04:20] all right
[1:04:21] so it's based on whether or not you can
[1:04:23] believe all right let's go to romans
[1:04:26] i told you a lot of scripture we may
[1:04:27] continue this service this afternoon
[1:04:30] but i don't doubt if i'm going to get
[1:04:32] through with it
[1:04:34] let's go to romans 4.
[1:04:37] and let's talk about this man named
[1:04:38] abraham
[1:04:40] and let's get in new testament
[1:04:42] terminology
[1:04:45] taken from the old testament terminology
[1:04:47] that he believed god
[1:04:52] god could not come down into his heart
[1:04:54] back there and give him eternal life
[1:04:56] right
[1:04:59] well let's ask a man named paul
[1:05:02] oh what do you think about abraham
[1:05:06] and how was this
[1:05:09] man
[1:05:10] brought to a state of righteousness
[1:05:15] okay
[1:05:17] romans 4
[1:05:21] what shall we say then that abraham our
[1:05:24] father
[1:05:26] as pertaining to the flesh had found
[1:05:30] now what's he found
[1:05:32] pertaining to the flesh
[1:05:34] if abraham were justified by works
[1:05:37] he hath were of the glory
[1:05:39] but not before god
[1:05:42] so it can't be based on works
[1:05:44] okay
[1:05:46] for what saith the scripture
[1:05:49] now if abraham were justified by works
[1:05:51] what saith the scripture
[1:05:56] abraham believed god
[1:05:58] and it was counted unto him for
[1:06:00] righteousness
[1:06:03] nothing about his works and you go over
[1:06:05] to james and james says show me your
[1:06:07] faith without your words right but that
[1:06:09] can't be contrary one to the other right
[1:06:11] right works is faith expressed
[1:06:14] okay
[1:06:17] watch verse 4. now to him that worketh
[1:06:19] is the reward
[1:06:21] not reckoned of grace
[1:06:24] but of debt right
[1:06:31] in other words
[1:06:34] you go to work you expect to get paid
[1:06:36] right
[1:06:38] right
[1:06:38] if you don't go to work you don't expect
[1:06:40] to get paid
[1:06:42] right
[1:06:44] of course that's changed in this day
[1:06:45] whenever i get paid for not going to
[1:06:47] work
[1:06:48] but
[1:06:49] and they want to talk about here
[1:06:52] i'm talking about the fact that even if
[1:06:54] abraham had some kind of works
[1:06:57] it would have been debt that god hold
[1:06:59] him
[1:07:03] we gave you the quotes from wrote around
[1:07:04] work that if you think you've done
[1:07:06] anything
[1:07:09] to save you christ died in vain amen
[1:07:13] he never died for you
[1:07:16] there's anything you think you've done
[1:07:18] or didn't do he didn't die for you
[1:07:21] right
[1:07:26] so listen
[1:07:30] under him that worketh is a reward not
[1:07:32] reckon of grace but of debt
[1:07:35] but to him that worketh not
[1:07:39] but believeth on him that justified the
[1:07:41] ungodly
[1:07:42] his faith is counted for righteousness
[1:07:46] okay
[1:07:50] and i thought we get to it this
[1:07:52] afternoon probably but i thought we were
[1:07:54] born from faith to faith
[1:07:58] all right
[1:08:01] but to him that worketh not but
[1:08:03] believeth on him that justified the
[1:08:05] unknown what did that graham do he
[1:08:06] believed god
[1:08:08] his faith his revelation
[1:08:11] is counted for righteousness
[1:08:13] and there's the only channel for
[1:08:15] righteousness right
[1:08:17] okay
[1:08:20] even i told you i'm gonna get into this
[1:08:22] now so
[1:08:24] even as david also described the
[1:08:26] blessedness of the man
[1:08:29] unto whom god imputeth righteousness
[1:08:33] without works right
[1:08:36] now that's not over in the psalms see
[1:08:38] this is
[1:08:39] paul describing
[1:08:42] david's
[1:08:43] explanation in the spirit
[1:08:48] that's that's why i like to read the
[1:08:49] bible
[1:08:52] but i like to read it and think about it
[1:08:57] see
[1:08:59] even as david describeth
[1:09:02] the blessedness of the man unto whom god
[1:09:04] imputed righteousness without works
[1:09:07] right
[1:09:10] well god loved david so much
[1:09:13] yep he was fixing to kill me
[1:09:16] right
[1:09:20] and he would have it hadn't been for
[1:09:21] nathan the prophet
[1:09:25] but what is david saying
[1:09:27] blessed are they whose iniquities are
[1:09:30] forgiven and whose sins are covered
[1:09:33] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[1:09:35] not impute sin
[1:09:39] who is that man
[1:09:43] now you're going to describe that it
[1:09:45] can't be something
[1:09:47] uh
[1:09:49] some
[1:09:51] human reasoning
[1:09:55] you know that would make a man righteous
[1:09:58] we just got to find out it's not works
[1:10:01] it's faith right
[1:10:03] right now he's going to describe
[1:10:06] that it can't be
[1:10:08] anything you think
[1:10:11] because you had this seed in you because
[1:10:13] you were born a child of god because you
[1:10:15] have done this because you've done that
[1:10:19] so let's let him describe it
[1:10:22] cometh this blessing upon the uh the
[1:10:24] circumcision only
[1:10:26] know the
[1:10:28] jews are upon the uncircumcision also
[1:10:34] now does the blessing come on the
[1:10:36] circumcision only
[1:10:37] or does it come on the uncircumcision
[1:10:40] also
[1:10:44] for we say that faith was reckoned to
[1:10:46] abraham for righteousness
[1:10:51] now what how was it then reckoned
[1:10:55] when he was in circumcision or in
[1:10:58] uncircumcision
[1:11:00] not in circumcision but in
[1:11:01] uncircumcision
[1:11:03] in other words when god met abraham
[1:11:05] first he didn't circumcise you
[1:11:08] read your bible
[1:11:11] come on he didn't circumcise him upon
[1:11:13] their first meeting
[1:11:15] reach him out
[1:11:16] he was on over in the story that he
[1:11:18] required circumcision
[1:11:22] it was not when they first started
[1:11:25] because abraham was a gentile
[1:11:29] no no he wasn't you
[1:11:31] give me the bible
[1:11:35] there was no such word jew
[1:11:38] until the kings
[1:11:41] that's way on over in the scriptures
[1:11:45] and it was really the tribe of judah
[1:11:47] when other tribe was called jews
[1:11:52] but paul said i'm not all israel is
[1:11:54] israel not all jews are jews
[1:12:00] abraham was a gentile
[1:12:05] you want the quotes from the prophet
[1:12:09] so he believed god when he was in
[1:12:11] uncircumcision
[1:12:12] sure amen
[1:12:15] he was a healer worshiping idol
[1:12:19] helping his daddy make a living make an
[1:12:21] island or daddy
[1:12:24] that's right
[1:12:29] oh no abraham was a special genetic seed
[1:12:35] well if that was true now
[1:12:38] let's take that out of the way
[1:12:41] come at this blessing verse 9 upon thee
[1:12:45] see jew
[1:12:48] only or upon thee
[1:12:51] oh hedonistic gentiles
[1:12:54] no promise no word
[1:12:57] but we say that faith was reckoned
[1:12:59] abraham for righteousness
[1:13:03] how was it then recognized when he was
[1:13:05] in circumcision or in uncircumcision
[1:13:08] not in circumcision but in
[1:13:09] uncircumcision and he received a sign of
[1:13:12] circumcision a seal
[1:13:14] of the righteousness of the faith which
[1:13:17] he had yet being uncircumcised that's
[1:13:19] right
[1:13:23] he believed when he was uncircumcised
[1:13:25] are you following it that's right
[1:13:27] are you reading he believed when he was
[1:13:29] uncircumcised
[1:13:32] and god counted it for righteousness
[1:13:34] then had him to have circumcision
[1:13:36] that he might be the father of all them
[1:13:38] that believe though they be circum may
[1:13:40] be not circumcised that righteousness
[1:13:42] not might be imputed unto them also
[1:13:45] and the father circumcision of them who
[1:13:48] are not of the circumcision only
[1:13:51] and who is the father the gentiles the
[1:13:52] jews everybody
[1:13:54] but who walk in the steps of that faith
[1:13:56] of our father abraham
[1:13:59] which he had
[1:14:01] being yet uncircumcised
[1:14:05] so it don't count him as being some kind
[1:14:07] of special something right
[1:14:11] and only counts him to be able to
[1:14:12] believe god
[1:14:17] believing god was what made it counted
[1:14:18] for his righteousness amen that's right
[1:14:21] believing god is what made noah perfect
[1:14:24] right right
[1:14:26] believing god is what made job perfect
[1:14:28] right because he believed god and he
[1:14:30] offered the atonement that god said to
[1:14:32] do
[1:14:33] he said you go on for this and i'll make
[1:14:35] you perfect
[1:14:36] he told abraham walk before me and be
[1:14:38] thou perfect
[1:14:41] it's over time righteousness and
[1:14:43] perfection and all together
[1:14:46] as not as something that you and i could
[1:14:48] do
[1:14:51] but counting it what you can believe
[1:14:57] you know this would be true what i'm
[1:14:58] fixing to say if you told the world
[1:15:00] especially the religious world
[1:15:03] that if they'd stand on their head
[1:15:05] they'd all be saved do you know what
[1:15:07] would happen
[1:15:08] that most everybody would be trying to
[1:15:10] balance some juggle act
[1:15:12] to get on their head
[1:15:16] or you tell them to give this
[1:15:19] we had a guy right across the street
[1:15:21] from us live in the baptist church
[1:15:24] they preached him into heaven when he
[1:15:25] died because he painted the church and
[1:15:27] never do all the things
[1:15:30] he was a homosexual
[1:15:35] they sure didn't tell him he couldn't
[1:15:36] thank the church
[1:15:41] you say you're gonna tell somebody they
[1:15:42] can't wash down their church calling it
[1:15:43] homosexual but i'm gonna tell you ain't
[1:15:45] going to happen
[1:15:49] so let's go ahead and wash it down
[1:15:53] what do you understand
[1:15:57] it's what you believe
[1:16:01] but that's not what you believe or just
[1:16:03] what you believe
[1:16:05] it's what you believe about what god
[1:16:06] says
[1:16:07] right that's it
[1:16:09] abraham believed god spoke to him
[1:16:13] he must have he got up his family took
[1:16:15] off left them rich their own you know a
[1:16:17] lot nice life and everything heads out
[1:16:19] into the desert
[1:16:21] just because god said get up and believe
[1:16:23] here
[1:16:26] he didn't appear to him and meet him as
[1:16:28] melchizedek and all this and the other
[1:16:30] to begin with
[1:16:32] he traveled a large journey across him
[1:16:34] before he ever meets him as those forms
[1:16:40] we believe god
[1:16:41] amen
[1:16:46] the prophet of god said it's hard to get
[1:16:48] one man to believe another one but what
[1:16:49] if that man tells you what god says
[1:16:53] what does it matter who the man is right
[1:16:55] exactly right the donkey told the
[1:16:57] prophet one time
[1:16:59] uh
[1:17:00] you know you'd be killed if i hadn't
[1:17:02] he's talking to him i was thinking about
[1:17:04] that like not people thinking well you
[1:17:05] know animals don't talk they think we'll
[1:17:07] learn the garden you know you talk about
[1:17:09] the beast and you know the beast and eve
[1:17:11] talking they say animals don't talk well
[1:17:13] don't
[1:17:25] what do you believe god
[1:17:29] do you really believe what god says
[1:17:31] about you we'll have to end right there
[1:17:32] will come
[1:17:35] we'll have to see them more about this
[1:17:37] this afternoon we'll try to continue
[1:17:40] but think on these signs
[1:17:46] is it the goodness you've done or not
[1:17:48] done or whatever is that you believe in
[1:17:49] god
[1:17:53] because if it's the goodness you've done
[1:17:55] or didn't do then that's works
[1:17:58] and works would be dead then god would
[1:17:59] owe it to you that's right right
[1:18:02] that's sensible right man if there's
[1:18:04] anything we can do or not do then god
[1:18:06] owes it to us
[1:18:10] right
[1:18:22] just keep on believing
[1:18:25] what god said
[1:18:27] right
[1:18:30] he says you're righteous
[1:18:32] well i don't know what's eating your
[1:18:33] confessions not the same with you i
[1:18:35] thought we were supposed to i thought he
[1:18:36] was the high priest of our
[1:18:38] profession our confession right
[1:18:43] so whatever we confess is what he can
[1:18:45] confess back right right
[1:18:47] now i'm going to make this plane for
[1:18:49] just a second from the musician if you
[1:18:51] get ready
[1:18:52] don't get up because i want you to
[1:18:53] listen
[1:18:58] then
[1:19:00] if there's anything that we could think
[1:19:02] of
[1:19:06] in any way then christ didn't die for
[1:19:09] you
[1:19:11] absolutely
[1:19:12] because you're not believed amen
[1:19:15] if you think that you're a certain seed
[1:19:17] a certain line
[1:19:19] or a certain
[1:19:20] person then that would be dead
[1:19:26] and not grace
[1:19:30] if you think there's something i've done
[1:19:32] or didn't do or whatever
[1:19:34] they thing god owes it to you
[1:19:40] but if you can believe
[1:19:43] that no matter how good you say brother
[1:19:45] dale you don't believe in being good
[1:19:47] i've told you over and over and people
[1:19:48] don't understand that but that's all
[1:19:49] right i'm sorry
[1:19:51] i don't want you to be good i want you
[1:19:52] to be saved because if you get saved
[1:19:54] you'll be great
[1:19:56] the goodness will follow the saved life
[1:19:59] that's right amen
[1:20:01] that's right
[1:20:02] well don't you think sure i got a
[1:20:04] neighbor down there and said find a
[1:20:05] neighbor that would do anything in the
[1:20:07] world for me that's right
[1:20:11] he says you know where the tractor's at
[1:20:13] and the keys in it
[1:20:14] don't ask me for use of it
[1:20:19] he'd do anything in the world for me i
[1:20:22] believe
[1:20:25] is that going to save him
[1:20:28] maybe being good to me might save him as
[1:20:30] a foolish virgin we're talking about
[1:20:32] eternal life right here
[1:20:37] but you see
[1:20:39] if we can in any way
[1:20:41] conjure anything up right where would it
[1:20:45] be believing god
[1:20:50] would it be believing god
[1:20:52] well that's just too simple brother
[1:20:53] david to believe god
[1:20:55] i thought he was hidden and revealed in
[1:20:57] simplicity that's right
[1:21:01] i thought it was supposed to be simple
[1:21:05] i thought it was like what it joined the
[1:21:06] two and nine salvations of the lord
[1:21:08] right
[1:21:10] it's the goodness of god that leadeth me
[1:21:12] to repentance
[1:21:21] why did jesus give the parable of the
[1:21:24] the
[1:21:25] weight going in you know and the rich
[1:21:27] man couldn't go in
[1:21:30] because he had too many carers
[1:21:34] he didn't say nobody rich couldn't be
[1:21:36] saved
[1:21:37] he just said the biggest portion won't
[1:21:39] be
[1:21:40] because they won't give up what they're
[1:21:42] doing
[1:21:44] the rich young ruler proved it
[1:21:46] jesus didn't ask him for everything he
[1:21:48] had
[1:21:49] that's right
[1:21:51] and he said yes he did say what you have
[1:21:53] to give to the poor if he sold it kept
[1:21:55] height of it jesus said amen
[1:22:02] but what do you think about it
[1:22:06] you believe god
[1:22:09] you believe god's speaking to you
[1:22:12] maybe threw it down donkey
[1:22:18] no problem
[1:22:23] you see the only way you can be
[1:22:24] righteous is to believe god
[1:22:26] the only way you can be perfect is to
[1:22:28] believe god right right come on jesus
[1:22:34] faith
[1:22:35] is a revelation
[1:22:38] why would it have to be revealed to you
[1:22:40] if you was a certain scene yeah that's
[1:22:42] right
[1:22:44] you're a person
[1:22:46] or something that was you know good
[1:22:48] about it right
[1:22:50] but you don't believe the prophet talked
[1:22:52] about a seed yes sir
[1:22:54] a sure flat do
[1:22:58] i believe that prophet was a seed don't
[1:23:00] you
[1:23:02] but you know he said he had to go out
[1:23:04] there and get born again because listen
[1:23:05] to him last night said
[1:23:08] he'd come up there and save me he said i
[1:23:10] used to box that i used to have a temper
[1:23:14] he said i've tried everything it didn't
[1:23:16] work
[1:23:18] but he said when the holy ghost came
[1:23:20] they took care of everything
[1:23:21] that's right
[1:23:23] brother brown do you
[1:23:25] mean you had to receive the baptism of
[1:23:27] the holy ghost and he said and you
[1:23:31] that believe mary was the mother of god
[1:23:34] he said then your one you're talking
[1:23:37] about had to go to the upper room
[1:23:40] to receive eternal life
[1:23:45] so were there any good things that we
[1:23:47] could do that's right
[1:23:52] all by grace amen
[1:23:55] and then our works displays it what do
[1:23:57] we got
