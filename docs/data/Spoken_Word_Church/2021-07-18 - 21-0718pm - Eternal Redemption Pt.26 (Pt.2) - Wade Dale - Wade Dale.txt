========================================

god bless you all i'll try to keep it short but i can be seated um this is a really it's an older testimony i've told it to my friends before but uh someone told me to say it you know this sunday so i hope it'll be a blessing um this could have been four or five years ago but it was actually at the be wise is that the byc camp meetings about four or five years ago and i um i remember i used to be very anxious about my future and what you know what was in my future and sometimes it would keep me up at night or i'd be worried about what's gonna happen tomorrow or what's good or what i'm gonna do you know five years from now and it would always keep me up it would stress me out and i would always like have this problem and i knew as a christian like we weren't supposed to supposed to give it in god's hands and not worry about it and just give it to him so these cam meetings come around and i just want to be delivered of that and i had this uh this phrase in my head that's like i just want there was a line to get prayed for so i had a phrase in my head to say like i i want to give my future to god and that was what i wanted to do so i had that in my head and i went up to the line and i remember i got to the front of the line and there was exactly a girl in front of me being prayed for and as she was being prayed for the song started to play because he lives i can face tomorrow and even before i was prayed for i received it right there and i've never had that problem since and i still i still haven't prayed for i still you know went through the motions but i believe even before i was prayed for right in the line they played the song because he lives and and that it was given like almost like a new revelation of that song to me and you know a lot of times we listen to songs and we just we sing through them and go through the motions but if you listen really really listen to the lyrics and really you know pay attention right there's some good stuff in there it's not just it's not just you know we're here to sing and it's just a routine sometimes it's some really good stuff in those lyrics so i hope it'll be a blessing to you um yeah god bless you you can stand please

winning tonight lord willing and also on saturday at three o'clock we'll have our youth service and that youth service will start at three brother richard hyatt will be here and uh when the service gets over we'll see if we can get some volunteers to uh serve the food and all when uh when we get ready on saturday to have the the youth service so remember that brother richard hyde will be here sunday both services he's a real good brother from russellville kentucky and uh you'll really enjoy and so just keep them in your prayers also camp meeting will be august 3rd through the 6th they will not have any foreign brothers so i don't know if there's any foreign brothers that we gonna have um because usually dad usually is a scheduler in august when all the when all the foreign brothers are over here but i don't think they're all going to be able to come or any of them i don't think so we'll just support them with our prayers and if we can go that'll be fine brother donnie reagan and brother ron spencer will be preaching those services so just support him with your prayer also brother richard gave me notes to the youth that are playing for the musicians playing for the meeting next weekend because the kids will be doing sunday um the youth services will be handled by all the young people next sunday that will be brother michael and the musicians need to practice after the service is over all right so if you're gonna play an instrument you gonna be playing instruments you need to meet after the service is over okay and that will be next saturday at three o'clock we'll have that and we'll we'll bring you up speed a little bit more in just a few minutes but if you got your bibles let's turn to hebrews and continue our thought we got to a spot this morning and i hope you understood what i was talking about with with job and leviticus there with the with the um jubilee year because that jubilee year was never it was never accomplished in the time of the jews that's why god put him into captivity and even said he was going to let the land rest for 50 years because they wouldn't they just kept planting crops and first one thing in another because god's going to always make sure he does what he said he was going to do but on that 50th year if you went free you were free if not then you stayed where you were at and you got born in the air with an awl amen that's why you know you look in the end time when you see sorry you see these people with their ears pierced just saying is that not a is that not a type of being bored in the ear with an awl and you're not being able to hear the word of god because you're doing something you're not supposed to do we we tr we try to like brother luis said we try to be we're in the world but we're not we're not of the world that's why we try to walk different that's why we try to walk by the bible and try to do as christians do according to the bible not according to somebody's law or somebody's denomination like i said this morning and we're going to read it here in amos that god does nothing until he reveals it to his servants the prophets first then that prophet does not stay silent and cannot stay silent he has to speak he has to prophesy he says what the lion hath roared who will not fear in other words that person is going to have to speak so let's not be scared now we need to be scared a false prophet but if you know who the true prophet is then you'll know who the false prophet is the problem is a lot of people don't know who the true prophet is so they take the false prophet as the truth as we're as we were talking about the beast and we'll talk about him the antichrist see everybody whole world's deceived by the whole world is deceived by the beast or the antichrist in in the end time now when the bride leaves the world this whole world is deceived by one man and he's a false prophet he's not a real prophet amen so let's just get into the book of hebrews 9 verse 11. just pray for us and uh continue to pray for brother dale and and hold him up mom too and all of us together the whole the whole bride body there's just one big family so we love you with the love of the lord and thank you for all those things hebrews 9. remember brother joe canada and then we'll be back this afternoon and brother aaron and sister sarah is going to be going out to wyoming and different places just pray that you bless them and also brother danny and sister joyce are already out there so they're well they're enjoying their time off and that's good you get time to go get away time to get away and go to some of these places you can see some of these places we're gonna have to wait the millennium to go see but that's okay i don't think i want to go the middle east at this moment i think i'll wait and go i think that's where we're gonna live for a few thousand years so you know for a thousand years at least so it'll be okay we'll be able to roam around travel like a thought we don't have to pay delta or anybody else or get caught in or get cut yeah or get called in get caught in a uh a line there with a tsa so it won't be no tsa sorry if there's a tsa agent watching in there won't be any tsa in glory thank the lord so god bless you and let's let's bow our heads thank you lord for this day that you give us now i pray that you would bless us be with us and the furthermore this service lord you be the one that does the speaking you be the one that does the hearing father you be the one that does to reveal him because without you lord it's just not it's just a meeting of people but lord let your holy spirit come down and be with each one not just come on us lord come through us and settle inside of us lord as you did on the day of pentecost lord and you stayed there and resided with the people and lord may we take what we have today and just take it out to the world lord and give it to a dying a dying and perverse world lord that we live in like i said we're we're in the world we're not of the world lord and we thank you for that we thank you that you've taken us out and you've temporarily sure raptured us and resurrected us out of there but lord we're looking for that great resurrection and that time of rapture when we can leave this world lord and not be able to not have to have any ties connected to this world lord will be with you in glory for a while lord just be with the people and bless them take care of the ones on the highways brother joe and the different ones they're coming in now brother aaron brother danny and sis george that are traveling lord on vacation we pray that you just touch them bring them back safe together here they will all be one together in you father in jesus name we ask these things amen y'all be praying for the youth services coming up we're trying to have them again so we want to uh we want to help the youth and answer some questions and and and i was looking at questions and answers uh brother branham was talking about different things and it's where he said you know questions make a strong church so if you have questions then you need to ask i always enjoyed them brother dale did questions and answers for a long time ago before some of y'all started coming here there used to be a question box in the back wasn't it like was an old bible case or something it was a question had a little slit in it's a question box and people would be able to anonymously slide a question in every once in a while you know and and that was good we able to somebody that brother dale was able to answer those questions so maybe we can get back to that a little bit but if you have a question in your mind then you know we we want to be able to let the lord answer because he's got the answers to all questions amen hebrews 9 but christ being coming high priests are good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us now let's go to amos three we're going to cover this a little bit more this afternoon and then then we're going to get to the two prophets brother donnie i promise you today we're at least going to say two prophets i just said it so we don't have to do it again surely the lord god will do nothing look at that by if you got your bible if you don't have a look right up here surely the lord god capital god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servant servants the prophets we know he sent us a string of servant of prophets down through the bible so let's not be so scared that god sent us a prophet in the end time okay because he's not going to do anything unless he reveals it to his servants the prophet first and then the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord god hath spoken who can but prophesy so in other words the anointing that's on that person is going to transfer because he has the mind of god he has the voice of god he's speaking something to you but remember it's not going to return void so it's got to hit something it's got to go in something right or it's just vain jangling it's just words that are spoken but no he sent a prophet to tell us something and not to the whole world because the whole world could accept it but they don't so we only sent it to a select group of people in that age and we know what that is for the end time now so look in revelations 11 3 and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy so there's two prophets going to israel and that they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred three score days that's 260 days or three and a half years according to the prophetic calendar clothed in sackcloth so you may be seated the lord has blessing and we're just going to kind of jump through from this morning if that's all right we'll not go to leviticus where we were talking about the jubilee year but we'll continue down to revelations 1 verse 13 brother anderson if you would keep that chart handy we may pull it up in just a minute if that's all right hey man we love the brothers in the back they even without brother joe here they're doing a good job they do a good job anyway they kind of all work hand in hand anyway that's why i said about the mark of a true church and market with two churches if somebody's out there's somebody to fill the place and there's not really that much of a gap you know as far as filling the place back up so we we really enjoy that because god i like god god's in continuity god god flows god's not somebody just says well i think i'll do this and then i think it didn't work so i think i didn't know whatever he thought that's what worked right amen whatever he thought that's what's going to work so we see now in revelations 1 we've been through all the eternal redemption how god had to sin had to come himself as the lord jesus christ and he had to be the savior of the world and he had to die on a cross and he was resurrected and what happened on the day of pentecost is that same man in the form of the holy ghost now he said i'll come back there in the in the scriptures he says i'll come back i'll send a comforter i'll come back and he'll come in my name and he'll come in my father's name so what's the name of the father father's not a name like water baptism father's not a name son is not a name holy ghost is not a name that's a title to a name what is the name of god the lord jesus christ amen jehovah's not even the name jehovah's a title god's not even a name amen god's not even a name there has to be a name attached because when the bible says everybody in heaven is going to be named one name and that's jesus christ and if there's only one god then that's jesus christ and then you and i are called what mrs jesus christ being the bride amen in the midst of the seven candlesticks so he came back on the day of pentecost into the 120 people and they went out and started the gentile dispensation because god had to put israel away because they i don't want to say the word went whoring but that's what the bible says they in other words they took on another husband while they were supposed to be married to christ they took on another husband called the devil called baal called bell ill all the different things that they got their self mixed up with and god said okay i got to put you away because i can't take you back because you've been defiled all right and under that defilement god couldn't take them back but he couldn't forget israel because they were the apple of his eye they were the ones he started with but then there was a gentile bride that he would come for in the to the 2000 years of church ages and this is the church ages revelations 1 verse 13 says in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pounds with the golden girdle now we know the pabst is up here that's the breast that's feminist so he was in bright form you're not going to see jesus christ on this earth everybody understand that right the physical man jesus is not going to be here until the millennium if not then he's got two bodies and this is his body his spiritual body you and i are going to meet him in the air he's not coming back here in a physical form he's coming back in a spiritual form but he's going to go into physical you amen the son of man is going to be physical in your flesh but we're going to meet him in the air if not he would have two bodies he's heading his hair with white like walls white is snowing his eyes flame of fire see that shows me also we were talking about this morning that's not going through the tribulation period the bride will not go through the tribulation period i read a few more quotes back there talking about enoch and different ones and the five wives and the five foolish virgin the five wise virgins they got up got the call and they went on with the bridegroom right the five foolish virgins had to stay here because they didn't have enough oil they didn't have any holy ghost to take them out of here so they had to stay and go through the tribulation period so the church does go through the tribulation period but the bride does not go through the tribulation period amen that's why you need to see that's why the study of god had to send a prophet to tell us the difference between the church and the bride right because you look and you see as brother branham said he said you know somebody said well brother brown i see the woman in the sun and i see this woman here and i see this over here and i see this over here he said you got that mixed up he said there's a church and there's a bride right amen there's a church nominal out there that this can be saved and sanctified come on brothers and sisters i mean we're not inclusive right okay we're definitely exclusive but we are exclusive to god but you're not going to do away but they're not going to get the position that you and i get same way with like israel israel couldn't take the position of bride anymore because she did what she did me and you can't take the well anyway we're bright right by the new birth we're bright we are not bright just because we live here we're not bright just because we say the message of the hour is correct we're bribed because the bible tells us that we need to be justified sanctified and filled with the holy ghost not just an anointing and not just a feeling and not just a i believe jesus died on the cross well you know what the devil believes that too because he was there and watched it the devil was back in eternity well he was in eternity but he wasn't eternal but he was back in that part of time or no time where there was no time he was back there with god right he saw the development of all this he just don't believe he's an unbeliever figure that i mean he is but this tells us right here his head and his hair was white like what if he's in bribe form he is a judge so the bible says the saints will judge the earth that's like i said before we were talking about this morning when you look in revelations there when we read where there were thrones thrones plural by people sitting on the throne that was in not being judged but given the right to judge well that's what the bride is right here his head in his hair was white like wool white of snow what the wig of the judge yes and his eyes was flames of fire and his feet like in the fine grass now what the prophet of god tell us brass you look up brass in the old testament i mean in the new testament it means judgment right amen so there you are the bride is standing not in judgment but judging the whole world out of those 2 000 years of seven church ages that's where your judgment is going to be coming from amen right and his feet was locking the brass and they burned in a furnace in his voice as the sound of many waters waters is what people and he had in his hands seven stars so he had the stars in his hand excuse me and what happened out of his mouth when a two sharp two-edged sword what the word of god in those seven people and his countenance was as the sun shineth in the strength when i saw him i fell as my feet is dead laid his right hand on me and said unto me fear not i am the first and last he was identifying who he was and where he was i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore and have the keys of hell and of death write these things which als you've seen and things which are things will shall be hereafter here's the part here the mystery scroll it all the way up or down whichever one verse 20. the mystery of the seven stars which thou saw us in our right hand and the seven golden candle sticks the seven stars are the angels now we look that word up angels it's not an angel listen angels don't have wings man came up with that god didn't because but look man with man well if angels can fly they got to have wings and then you see the ones in ezekiel that had wings but they weren't angels they were creatures right right yeah so you just got to read watch your terminology all right that's why there's no women angels that's right they're all men amen the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches now you have to identify that in the greek lexicon it tells us that is a messenger from god an envoy one who is sent an angel a prophet amos said it had to be sent to you a messenger from god to what bring you a specific message so you can prophesy the prophet of god tells us you could profit the gift of prophecy could be to someone in this building and it could fall on brother donnie and he could stand up and prophesy and never do it again god used him one time there'd be a spirit of prophecy following brother donny he stand up and prophesy that didn't make him that does not make him a prophet a prophet has a message a prophet has a specific message and down through the seven church ages there was paul irenaeus martin columba luther wesley and the prophet of god in the end time that brought specific messages as we were talking this morning and brother paul so so valiantly he picked up what i was i was trying to find you remember you're a smith euros smith is the one that brother brown used a lot of times in some of his charts too and i kept trying to think of that and he said you forgot to say you're a smith so uh thanks for sitting right there in the front row and telling me that i missed something i appreciate that yeah you mean he sold the people i hope russ is watching him he does you okay all right that's scary so anyway but a messenger from god you saw all these minor messages though that came from yura smith that came from clarence larkin that came from moody calvin even um you look at oral roberts billy graham all the great men that we're not doing away with them they have their place but remember they weren't placed in the bible and had the had the manifestation according to what the bible said right now everybody will understand what i'm saying right clarence larkin was not in malachi 4. right right that's right now he could be a preacher but he didn't have a message to a church age a specific message like the prophet of god did and he was vindicated all over the world and he was vindicated here in malachi 4. so let's read malachi 4. behold i will send you elijah the prophet now remember we we talked about this morning we're going to kind of just glance over to save time because we are going to get to the two prophets i think i think we may not get there but that's okay we listen we'll background as much as we need the background somebody needs it he needs to be you know the background i don't want to lose nobody behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord now the first elijah that came was back in kings elijah himself the number one and he didn't restore before he smoked the earth with a curse and he wasn't one came before the great battle day of the lord he was back in the old testament but we know that the characteristics of the prophet elijah had to be given to us five different times elijah elisha john the baptist william branham and then the one that's going because they're looking for elijah i'm going to read it here in a minute those two prophets when they go to israel they're looking for elijah according to malachi 4 because remember excuse me the bible stops right here to a jew everybody got that all right what are we doing oh thank you son that's my boy what kind of cough drop is that ask christine i don't know ask for who that's christina ask who that's christine that's good i'm gonna talk like a girl she's gonna give me something thank you sister christine let's see right here never again i'll get over this in a minute boy that's tough the bible stops right here for for the children of israel i mean for for israel because there's no matthew mark luke and john everybody got that so what they're doing they're reading like we're reading revelations they're reading malachi 4 behold i will send you talking to the israel i will send you elijah to the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful death of the lord so they say under their interpretation of what they see this ain't good from what they see i'm gonna i hope there's something good inside that when it gets done it's got a different taste to it but thank you i'm sorry take you i'll i'll i'll use it but they're thinking that that elijah has got to show up before jesus shows up before their messiah shows up right because of that scripture right there but now according to scripture when we're going to read in zechariah when those two prophets go over there and tell reveal to them that they miss that elijah coming right right they're going to say oh my we killed the messiah we we're way behind we're looking at elijah number number one and we've already been almo we're getting elijah number five and we'll read that in just a minute i hope brother donnie we will but there's a specific thing that he's got to do he's going to turn the heart of the fathers to the children we know that was john the baptist because he was standing between this old testament and the new testament right he was an old testament prophet still he was in the old testament prophesying under jesus time to what he didn't come to he came to turn the hearts of the old old jewish orthodox old testament to the faith of the new children the 120 that's going to be in the upper room to a new message everybody got that all right yes yes okay one more time sister freda says you didn't understand that that's okay we're gonna guard it again he shall turn the heart of the fathers orthodox old testament fathers older than a child right father's older than a child so he's going to turn this this is john the baptist that's why it's head folks that's why it took a profit to tell us how to separate these things just like that one little word we read we're in judgment not of judgment all right and he shall turn to the heart of the fathers old testament fathers yes the 12 tribes of israel he was trying to get caiaphas in all them too but caiaphas is not going to he's not going to take it right but that's the old are you getting it now the old testament to the children which he's saying all right what's john the baptist doing we don't we're not going to get to do prophets today what did john the baptist do he stood between the old testament and the new testament because he is his job his message was only six months long right right that's right preach six months didn't heal a person that wasn't his message his message was the voice of one malachi 3. i didn't bring that didn't know i was going this way but we're going this way malachi 3 was what i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness now what did john do john at nine years old y'all don't try this went back into the wilderness and eat locust and wild honey right right came out of the wilderness the voice of one crying in the wilderness saying behold in other words the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world there was a new message coming it wasn't going to be under the law it wasn't going to be under the the judges and the kings and all these different things in the old testament behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world is going to be something new jesus christ had never stepped foot on the earth since that time old testament he spoke to prophets he spoke through these different ones but there was the man there was god almighty in human flesh and john saw he said the the one i cease the spirit descend and remain right that's right remember he was a prophet he could see in another dimension now the bible was specific i believe when god told john he said hey now look john you're going to see the anointing fall on different people because remember them in pharisees they were always around john they were always wanting to mess up right and they might have seen the spirit of god anoint them sure but it would lift off of them but now the bible says john the one you see that the spirit descends and remains that's the one that you identify as the savior of the world that's me that's the one that's going to save the world because confidence couldn't save the world you can't save the world with just an anointing and anointing come off but you've got to be the one that is the anointing and you got to be the anointed amen amen so that's what john did he turned the hearts of the fathers to the children in other words right here to the because they became children before they became adults that's just pretty simple and putting two together not not showing that this is just this is john the baptist and this has to be a prophet in the end time before i come and smite the earth with a curse everybody got that and he shall turn the heart of the father's what the heart your soul yeah the soul of you he's going to turn your thinking around and send you in another direction so john the baptist took the old testament people and introduced them to a new message all right not bulls and goats got it now not bulls and goats not not lavers and going doing saying hail mary's and you understand what i mean but here's the man's gonna save the world by coming and shedding his blood the supreme sacrifice the lamb of god that will take away the sin of the world this only covered the sin of the world john knew that this only covered it or capo covered this over here eradicated the sin of the world behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world so there's john and six months later he was dead yeah god used him six months that's all he had right but you know what one of the most powerful what about a preacher what about a priest what about a prophet that his only job was to introduce the messiah and without him you didn't get introduced to the messiah because what did he do behold because you can see john's he's sitting he's baptizing people he's probably he's not baptizing him in the name of jesus christ because he didn't know that yet but he's baptizing them unto repentance and all of a sudden a man walks up right right just a common man no beauty that man should desire him he didn't stick out in the crowd and that prophet like brother brown said that prophet's eyes met that prophet's eyes and when that prophesy i met that other prophet that prophet saw met his bet his maker he said behold yes amen the lamb of god that'll take away the sin of the world pointed right at him and said that's the one that you gotta follow not me i must decrease that he may increase amen so it's always jesus christ listen a prophet never points you to his self if a prophet points you to himself he's not a true prophet and our prophet in the end time he never pointed his to himself ever he pointed to jesus christ and through his message through his shout through his voice through the message that we get in the end time i see christ as real and more real then they're going to see him over there through those two witnesses because i'm his bride i'm not just a chosen one i'm his bride i'm his intimate one i'm his one that he gives all of his love to right not that he doesn't love the other people that's okay but i i love all you but now jim's only ones going home with me today amen right so that had to stop here and the heart of the children what the children that had been turned to the new testament okay got it everybody got that now this prophet that had to come in the end time he had to turn a group of children back to fathers in other words from baby to maturity all right so from baby they started down here as full grown some 120 in the upper room but when it got up to right here at the pentecostal age it was pentecostal babies yes everybody speak in tongues everybody do this everybody got a song everybody got a list everybody got that well that's why that the prophet of god had to go to the pentecostals because they were children now listen they were in the family because they were children so don't do away with them they were children they were part of the family but they were babies and they couldn't grow anymore without god sending a prophet to turn them back as i was saying this morning that you've got this strand of eternity and the eternal word of god can't be changed but satan can come in and he can he can cut it and let it become non-effective because those loose ends are hanging down so god had to send a prophet in the end time because he's got to restore a prophet is a restorer like we talked about elijah this morning all right we'll cover in just a second we'll just kind of skim over it but a prophet's a restorer but a prophet also does something else if you reject his message what is it judgment right right that's right right just like this two like elijah there stood elijah with a woman and a baby a woman and a child and he said if you'll do what i say right right the woman that he meets when he goes down to after the god calls him out and tells him to go down to that city and they're having a three and a half year drought because he's the one that called for three and a half years of no rain right so he goes down in the middle of that chaos and he tells a woman top of the what church he says woman if you'll do what i say your crews will never run dry in other words you'll sustain yourself through this church age but now that's one woman right she did what he said i mean at the throes of death she did what he said she said i ain't got enough meal but just to make one little bitty cake me and my son's gonna die he said make it for me first make it for me first he said but thus saith the lord cruise will not run dry right and your meal barrel will never in other words when she dipped in that mill barrel and she dumped it over here she put the spoon back in there and it was level she'd reach and get it forever how many years that was it'd be level again it never went down where she had to scrape the barrel again why because she did what the prophet told her to do but now listen there's a woman that part of the church that elijah went to but now elijah went to another woman in the same region called jezebel she was jezebel's pastor whether she wanted to believe it or not because he was a god-sent prophet to that area he was her preacher right and he told her cause she was like i'm gonna kill you and elijah did what now did he have any grace for her no cause she turned it down he said the dogs will lick your blood yeah and they ate her up so much the only thing i didn't eat was the palm of her hands and something else but that was the two women or two churches so every time elijah came on the earth the spirit of elijah there was two women two types of the church that he had to deal with amen when brother branham came on earth there was a bride that needed to be taken into glory there was another bride that he said i indict you i indict you for killing jesus christ again and putting him on the cross because your denominational ideas amen so he didn't hate women he just hated the spirit that was on them same way with elijah all right so let's go to first kings real quick oh i'm sorry go to matthew 17. i'm sorry you're you're right let's read this right here because this is mount transfiguration listen we're going to come back to this because on mount transfiguration guess what happened you're looking at a prefigure of the rapture and the children of israel getting their message you got jesus and moses and elijah we're going to get back to that in a minute and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that the lies must first come according to malachi 4. that's what they're saying the scribes and jesus said elijah truly shall first come and restore all things not just part not just not just turn back from a little one to a bit no he's going to restore all things what all those loose ends that have been untied and been cut and all those denominational ideas listen god can't be this confused to have 13 000 different ways to go to heaven that's right you say you got the only way jesus said i am the way. i'm not ways i am the way the truth and the life so there's only one way to get to heaven and that's the correct revelation of who jesus was and jesus answered the center of them he lies truly shall first come and restore all things so we know that that had to be not not the uh john the baptist because he didn't restore all things he introduced a messiah okay so it had to be the fourth coming of elijah to restore it in the end time according to put all the other scriptures together you got to take you can't just take one scripture you got to take all scriptures and put them together revelations 10 7 male 1 4 5 in kings no go back to kings we see that elijah this is number one elijah we were talking about this this morning we'll fly through it pretty quick and elijah said unto the prophets of baal now there's one elijah standing on top of mount carmel 400 preachers of baal right right 400 remember how many wasn't one in a congregation we're standing on this mountain boy there must have been something going on there was a showdown folks there was a showdown between right and wrong the devil has always said if i can get enough enough numbers i can beat god god can take one right right amen gideon david all those different ones that the odds were so astronomical moses destroyed a nation as big as the united states of america through god god through him did so we're not worried about that you know what elijah wasn't either i believe you know he he probably had a vision the day before he probably had a vision today before and he knew all this was going to happen you can calmly walk into a battle when you know you've already won it so you say well what about us we've already known we won the battle we've already known death is not part of this we've already won the battle if you're born again great amen that's not going to take the taste of my mouth so elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one bullet for yourself and dress it first for year or many many of you 400 against one odds are insurmountable surely their god is going to show up surely your denominational idea is all right say then call on the name of your gods and put no fire under they took the bullet what's given them they dressed it called in the name of baal from morning until noon saying oh baal hear us but there was no voice what'd we say this morning according to amos there's a voice behind every prophet oh bail but there was no voice nor anything answered all you could hear was him screaming and they leaped upon the altar which was made and i'm sure they tore it down because elijah had to put it back together and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked him and said cry loud for he's a god either he's talking or pursuing uh he's on vacation pre-adventure he's sleeping it must be awaken some of you the same way and they cried aloud and cut themself after their manner with knives and lances till the blood gushed out upon them it was not a good looking place and elijah's just standing over there he knew where he was standing and it came to pass when midday was passed that they prophesied at the time of the offering of the evening time that there was neither voice nor any answer nor any that regarded in other words they did all that in vain and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came nearing him and he said and he repaired the altar or restored the altar of the lord that was broken down in other words he took 12 stones he took revelation and put the revelation back where it's supposed to be according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob remember he was in the old testament and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altars greatest who contained two measures of seed and he put the wood in order he's putting everything back in order he's restoring worship because god's not gonna come with all that junk all over the place he got to restore worship and he cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels of water and pour it on the burnt and sacrifice it on the wood he wanted to make sure this was going to be a miracle yeah right if it had been gasoline it had been a different story but water and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time you know what we talked about this morning and the water ran everywhere and he filled the trench with water everything was soaking wet no way water could i mean a fire could do this and it came to pass at the time of the offering of even sacrifice that's what i mean folks let me tell you something it looks like to the outside world that we can't do what we do it looks to the outside world like we just can't y'all just can't do what you're doing we're doing it how simple we're doing it and i'm happy about it i'm happy that the world thinks i'm different amen i didn't say crazy i said different okay and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant look at that identification that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things after our word god had already told him that christ hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou has turned their heart back again just the same as what happened in malachi 4. turn the heart back now we know the rest of the story now if you don't know the rest of the story you need to read your bible god came down and didn't just consume the sacrifice all the water was gone and then they took those 400 prophets and they took them down to the river kidron and they killed all 400 of them elijah was there with him why because the message of the hour is what kills those demons every demon you've got the message of the hour will kill it i promise you and you say with the message of the hour the message of the hours lord jesus christ through a prophet so there's the malachi 4. let's go to the next excuse me now this is where we had see the identification of the prophet in the end time now this message of malachi 4 in revelation 10 7 because what is revelations 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel so there's got to be a seventh angel sound there's got to be a seventh messenger to sound to show and reveal the mystery of god all right malachi 4 we just read it it's going to do two things malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers that's what we're talking about pentecostal babies right there you go all right go back up again thank you you're going to do according to malachi 4 he turned the hearts of the children what pentecostal babies to the faith of the established fathers peter james john all the old to all the old testament all the new testament the 120 in the upper room the ones that had the word of god peter james john the one that wrote the new testament bible what's the difference in when he came what's the difference in when william branham came on the earth and when they came on the earth there wasn't a baptist on this corner and a pentecostal in that corner and a methodist on that corner and a jewish on that corner and orthodox over here and then tunis and foreigners and oneness and job witness and seventh-day adventists and this just there wasn't that in the first church age there was fallacies there was little sayings but there wasn't those demons so as we have now when the prophet of god came on the scene he had to turn the hearts of the of the pentecostal babies to the faith of the fathers back to where listen just like i told you this morning no prophet ever told you that hell was eternal that's right it's not in the bible but you learned it from somewhere some man told you yeah right you didn't just come up with it on your own right some man had to tell you that right trinity not even in the bible no such thing a man told you that and you believed it before you came into the message right right some man stood up and told you that right now how confused is god he's one right right correct so satan had to feed you the three water baptism never was instituted in the new testament in the name of the father son holy ghost because father's not a name son is not a name and holy ghost is not a name right you sure i'll tell you what jesus said i'm just telling you what jesus said how could jesus tell you one thing and peter tells you something else and and you know jesus didn't even have the keys to the kingdom peter i give you the keys to the kingdom and whatever you bind on earth i'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth i'll loose it in heaven and is that not right and peter stands up on the day of pentecost and says repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the father and of the son another if it had it would have clicked in heaven and it would have clicked on there he said repent every one of you and i know what jesus was saying because father's not a name son is not a name holy ghost is not a name there's only one name under heaven whereby men should be saved and that's the name of jesus christ and nowhere in the bible until the catholic church got a hold of it at about 300 or 600 a.d somewhere in there no one was ever baptized in the name of the father and the son the holy ghost because it wasn't true but but somebody stood up and told you that and you took it as what bible yeah is that not correct i know some of you i i i didn't come from that but some of you came from a trinitarian background and all these different things brother boyd came from a catholic background so did luis come from catholic or no methodist and a catholic background you were taught these things by a man but not a prophet that's why god had to send us a prophet to turn us back because if they didn't baptize in the name of father and son holy ghost in the new testament in the early stages of the faith of the fathers where did it go wrong through the church ages satan got involved and started not erratic you can't eradicate the word of god but you can make it of none effect didn't jesus say you've made it by your traditions you've made the word of god in none effect to the people but god winked at their ignorance but when we come to the end time where we're going to have to be in a resurrection we're going to have to be in a we're going to have to call the dead saints out of the ground listen jesus didn't stand and call lazarus out of the ground with a trinitarian idea i said idea because it's not a doctrine jesus wasn't standing there and said well i know hell's eternal but i'm going to bring lazarus out no he was the word of god amen and being the correct word of god he said i am the resurrection right amen lazarus come forth in other words there was no there was no black spots there was no gaps there was no false doctrine coming from that man and then i believe i didn't the prophet of god tell us that where's the resurrection it lies in you the resurrection lies in you the voice of the resurrection will not be right right right voice and it won't be lazarus this time come on he'll be richard marlowe it'll be your dad it'll be your husband your son that's who we're going to be calling hey man amen where's he gonna come from though falsehood that's why the son of man folks that's why it's so important to realize that we're under the son of man ministry we're not under the sun god ministry under the son of god ministry there can be places now god's never wrong but he winks at the ignorance down to the church ages because man has stood in the pulpit and told you all these things were okay right why i'm going with marriage and divorce we're not gonna talk about that right right okay but all the other major doctrines a man had to stand back here and tell you and if it wasn't according to the word of god it wasn't god that told you amen it was the devil because god is not false and he can't be deceived but you and i can but then he sends us a prophet in the end time to turn us back to the faith of the fathers put us back into the new testament where we baptize correct in the name of the lord jesus christ well we know there's no eternal hell because there's only one form of eternal life and if if hell was eternal god would have to be there the whole time that's right amen amen and a trinity behold o israel the lord thy god is three what'd i say three one there's only one god amen and jesus christ is his name i and my father are one they really kind of stumble over that it's kind of pretty much school teacher english i and my father are one were they but see they had to cut him apart so that god could send us a profit though listen if everything was all hunky-dory and we had the faith of the fathers and we were peter james and john was in our congregation doing our preaching for us we wouldn't need a prophet we need a prophet needed a prophet to restore us back to that so god said i'll do nothing unless i reveal it to my servants the prophets first and then i'm going to bring it to you amen amen everybody okay with this amen right so that was the importance of god sending a messenger sure he sent luther wesley he sent the the dowies he sent the uh you're a smith he sent all that and we we honor those people but they weren't identified in the bible as our prophet in the end time was identified in the bible he was identified truly as elijah he loved the wilderness he hated bad women all the different things he was absolutely the last the messenger of the end time he wasn't god because he was sex born so that just negated all that okay so you can get that out of your head we know that we don't believe that but let's continue let's skip a few right here let's go to where it says based on resurrection because in the end time well let's go to number three the queen of sheba now here we see in the end time we see a lot of people that we see people that had messages moody calvin knox finney all the different great ones spurgeon um what's the one that wigglesworth smith wigglesworth man i mean smith wigglesworth read his book i mean come on he goes into a shoe store and the boy don't even have any feet and he asked him what size shoe do you want and what color do you want and they said they said by testimony that the boy's feet when the man pulled the shoes out the boy's feet grew down into the shoe you say well that's just impossible come on little girl little girl what color eyes do you want oh i forgot remember the little girl she comes up to the prophet and she has no eyeballs right none right he says he pulls her to his bosom and he prays for it and he said he let her go and said oh i forgot what color eyes do you want amen oh what a mighty god we serve but see that's the sign that this generation got look down here in this generation what he's doing now they'll receive a sign but they won't believe it continue reading there you are but it came just the same and even an adulterous generation will seek after a sign and they'll have it it'll be given to them as jonah was in the belly of the well three days and night so the son of man will be in the heart of the earth we know that was jesus christ when he died and then he resurrected but the resurrection will be the sign and the resurrection a sign is given to the church in this last day like i said before this morning no man since the lord jesus christ ever stood and could point his finger and say you were at the doctor yesterday you had on a blue suit with a red ribbon in your hair you had on purple shoes i mean he was down to the detail down to the detail you live in house number 2334 on a certain certain street the doctor told you you have cancer it's on your left breast he said you're shadowed with death he prayed a prayer and he said okay the shadows left you lady you're healed nobody could do that right thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands of times went to india and 250 000 people were confirmed healed in one service they had to carry stretchers and wheelchairs he said he looked out the window and they were bringing them and those car carriers that carried the military piled full of stretchers there was our but listen that was a temporary resurrection sign everybody got that the dead was raised the sick was healed under the prophet of god but remember it's in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery that the resurrection can come from me in you the resurrection will be the sign the resurrection is signed as sign is given to the church in the last days remember the prophet of god told us he said what you see in its infancy my goodness are in part he said you'll see in the fullness at the end time oh my i mean good grief there'd be hundreds of people healed every night in service and that was just a part a piece well it was given to one man see it was given to one man now it's given to me and you it's given to me and you john revelation 10 8 to prophesy all right and the angel of the holy spirit in the meetings showing the same thing doing the same thing across the nation proving that jesus christ was raised from the dead just the same yesterday today and forever that's the generation that will receive it in other words they received the sign and turned it down because they looked at the healing campaign more than they looked at the message but now you and i are the generation that say yes we saw the signs that we saw we hear the prayer line we saw the signs and wonder some of you were sitting here in the building that was there sister tootsie sister cleta sister freda were sitting in the service and we had several others that had passed on brother joe canada's daddy brother robert tatum and several ones that were in actually in the meetings and saw the saw god heal people your daddy was called out in a prayer line wasn't he that's right mr duncan sure was called out in a prayer line all right so you see that it wasn't a fallacy it happened but remember they got hung on the signs and wonders because that's a temporary resurrection sign the resurrection sign is over here in the message of the hour where we're standing today this generation that takes the voice of god and prophesies and the dead in christ shall rise listen it's not going to be an angel come down from heaven stand here and go and the resurrection it's going to happen through us we're going to have so much faith in the lord amen but it's going to be just still baby faith faith is faith that's the generation that we're receiving let's go to the next one everybody all right everything christianity is based on resurrection if jesus christ didn't raise from the dead then there's no christianity because what are we believing mohammed is still in the grave but they sure believe he was a prophet but they believe he's going to resurrect we don't have to wait ours has already risen and we didn't have to have a white horse sitting there waiting on him when he got out of the tomb buddha airplane buddha waiting on in the river act right we're not waiting on hours to resurrect he's already given us the resurrection sign he gave us a resurrection signed through the prophet of god resurrection is a state of having passed completely through death and having risen from death to be in resurrection is different than to be alive obviously to be alive is the original state without having passed through death now listen we're going to read in a minute that those who are alive and remain so there is a group this is going to be the ones that do the calling to be alive is the original state without having passed through death to be in resurrection is to have passed through death and have been raised up and like i said this morning jesus went through death burial resurrection but he didn't die again lazarus died again all the people that brother branham not brother brethren but god threw the prophet of god raised from the dead they all passed on right yeah so that was temporary resurrection listen when you get healed it's a temporary resurrection amen you sure feel better when god heals you don't you well that's a temporary resurrection but then all of a sudden the next day your other leg hurts yeah right sister leaves you your other leg hurts and then your other arm hurts and go god heal me this headache well that's good well you see what i mean it's temporary but we're coming to a place to where it's full the full resurrection is going to take place to be in resurrections have passed through death to have been raised up now remember you got to take the scriptures in the bible it says we're already resurrected sitting in heavenly places i believe it's my colossians or somewhere in there raised up sitting in heavenly places but that's the soul that's right not the body amen but jesus resurrected in a body he resurrected in the body he died in what a miracle and we'll resurrect anybody we went down in it'll just be made new right amen and then it will be a new body but now some people preach it'll be a new body where you just throw this one away no listen i'm connected to this guy so are you and most denominations they believe that this thing's going to just stay in the grave and you're just going to get this brand-new something over here no that's not resurrection we're talking about resurrection resurrection is if i drop this down and if i pick this up i am resurrecting that piece of paper if i put this bottle down and then pick this piece of paper up that's not resurrection that's replacement it's going to be a miracle to god change this thing right here it's not a miracle if he just goes and gets him another one out of a closet and just sticks it on you right am i right am i right that's the miracle that this could come what born in sin shaping and iniquity see that's what the world in their mind they say i'm so sinful i'm not good and you're not good ain't perfect you ain't either that's not what god said right come on yes god said be there for perfect even as my father in heaven is perfect and if i'm in him i'm perfect in him so i'm going to come up and be resurrected in this body if i have to go by the grave this body and then it's just going to be changed into new. amen you be careful with your replacement and your resurrection when the prophet of god says new body he is not meaning new as in listen let me give you a little because it was brought to my attention that brother brown said that you get in your body you got to continue on with the puzzle go to the future home i'm telling you if you have a problem with any of the resurrection new body justification that's why i love that that sermon the future home he covers all that so now what does he tell us about the earth aren't you connected to the earth well donnie we're not going to get two wins is that okay aren't you connect didn't you come out of this earth didn't your body 16 elements your dad ate your mama ate they come together you came and got a body with 16 elements right and where'd it come from not outer space it came from the earth so you're connected to this earth now the bible tells us that heaven and earth will pass away then there i believe it in peter or somewhere it says we'll be we'll we'll pass away with a great noise so see everybody thinks that the unite that the whole world's just going to blow up and god's going to make a new one but remember it took a prophet to god to tell us that word is anonym or whatever that long word is and it does not mean annihilation it just means clean it off that's right so that's what he's going to do with your body because you're connected to this earth if he's not going to destroy this earth he's not going to destroy this earth but see it's hard to believe when you get up in the morning that i'm saying what i'm saying you know what i'm saying right brother paul yeah we get up and get up in shifts and you try to get your feet up first and you'll understand later on that's why we're going to be turned back to them 20 year old kids they're going what's he talking about i just jump up out of the bed whatever time and i you know my shoes are already on before i hit the floor i got to get to the floor first and it might be my face first right right because i'm what born in sin i've got i'm getting older but this thing's going to be changed back to that 20 year old person i was because remember god took a picture of you when you were that age and he's going to ship you right back to that age he's not going to annihilate the world listen the bible tells us we're going to live right here this is where we're living this is our heaven john saw the new city coming down out of heaven settling onto the earth this is where we're going to live folks and it's going to be a redeemed earth it's going to be a earth that's been washed that's been burnt by fire that's been renovated sin has been annihilated same way as when the dead saints come out of the ground they're going to step in this dimension and boom 20 years old amen oh what are you what are youth meeting we're gonna have right it will never end either to be resurrectionists have passed through death and they've been raised up let's go to the next one we haven't even got where he was this morning i like these little refresher courses though it kind of helps everybody out a little bit amen now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead i'll say some among you that there's no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vein and your faith also vain and i'll ask you another question when jesus resurrected because remember he's the first fruit right first fruits of the resurrection he's the first one that came out of the ground and he never has to go back into the ground again is everybody right with that right first fruits of the resurrection so whatever whatever listen first fruit if if the first thing comes to maturity is corn and it came out of a corn field what's the rest of the crop corn hello corn so whatever happened to this first fruit is going to happen to the rest all right all right so is there an empty tomb or is there a tomb with a body laying in it there's an empty tomb so in your resurrection hey that's going to be an empty tomb right and you're not going to have to dig your way out that's the great mystery your mama taught you can't tell that your mama and your grandma taught you that one day you're gonna walk out there and them graves are gonna just pop right open and there's gonna be dirt laying everywhere no remember this is secret catching away secret catching away they'll never be there where you have to listen our first fruits jesus christ when he came back on earth right the bible said basically he walked through a wall remember they were in the upper chambers they had all the doors locked they had all the windows closed and he appeared among them in a flesh body not a spirit because they were saying that he perceived that in their mind he said give me some fish and then i bet you old toddlers because he's a little bit down in thomas he said i bet that fish is going to hit the floor because the spirit can't eat i bet he's going to put it in it's going to go no he was a human he had turned back to a young man that's why they didn't realize who he was number one number two he ate that fish and it went right down inside of him but then again when he left he just went right through the wall again what about that that's what a glorified body will do for you mine and yours is not glorified yet i got to go open that door to get outside but if there be no resurrection of the dead see that's why i've been trying to try to mold in my mind i told you about the son of man if we take the character of what jesus was on earth he was the son of man if we're supposed to have the son of man ministry back here in the end time the same as that according to luke 17 30. then we always take this character of this man and bring it over here and say all right where am i missing it right now i know between there and here there's a virgin birth that i can't ex that i can't get over i i didn't come that way but i'm not almighty god i'm part of almighty god he was born virgin birth i wasn't but he he basically told me he said if you believe in me so i'll do away with that by your new birth that's why i told nicodemus he said nicodemus you must be born again and nicodemus said what have i got to go get back in my mama's womb and be born jesus said no that's your problem yeah if you go back do again you're double in trouble he said you got to be born from above then you want when you're born from above sure you're going to have problems sure you're going to have heartache sure you're going to have trial sure you're always going to have a characteristic of the person that birthed you but you can be born again by jesus christ and you act different you can't have an excuse that well i got to be this way because my mom and dad is this way you know what i want to be the way that my mom and daddy is right the bible tells him that tells me that my mother is new jerusalem which is the mother of a saul and i know who my father is too so that's what we need to act like because he's to do we have that genetics inside that's going to that's what's going to change us to the outside or we'll get to that later but if there'd be no resurrection of the dead then this christ is not risen and if christ be not risen then does our preaching and vain and your faith also in vain let's go to the next one revelation 20 verse 4. here's what we're talking about this morning and i saw thrones not one throne thrones and they sat upon them they many people the bride me and you we don't stand in judgment amen and judgment was given unto them to judge the world the bible says the saints will judge the earth we'll even judge angels and we're not worthy i'm going to say i'm worthy because he said i'm worthy and i saw the souls of them were beheaded for the witness of jesus for the word of god which had not worshiped the beast now look i didn't stop that this morning if i'm gonna stop right here we'll cover it when we get to the two witnesses the whole world when we leave this place the whole world world seven billion people are going to worship the beast and in the denomination worlds you're already worshiping if you're out there hello the and her daughters i'm just reading the bible which had not worshipped the beast so it couldn't be though it has to be bride neither his image neither had received his mark remember bless her heart diana diana the other day she's trying to she's trying to live better just pray for her my granddaughter she's trying to wear dresses and not cut her hair and and just pray for her um but she said papa she said somebody told me that uh if you had a tattoo that you're going to hell well i thought okay but where's that coming from i always try to look and see where that comes from not just to because a kid will process things somebody like me and freda we just say what we're thinking and then we have to apologize for it but i ain't wrong i know that no no longer than you have buddy so but a child though analyzes something and something has to spark that interest to ask that question everybody write with me young kids it sparks a question because something happens all right so she said pablo is it true that people this is it true that people are going to go to hell because they have a tattoo i said no because i was thinking i thought well you know what there's a movie a long time ago called the omen don't ever look it up this was bc before christ but it talks about the antichrist and what it was there was a 666 tattoo in a little boy's head and he was supposed to be the antichrist and they were going to try to kill him they found the 666 and then that's what deanna was asking about the stamp or the tattoo or the mark that's why we talked about the mark upon their forehead listen folks the world is so uh amorized with with vision they got to see this listen with god everything's secret unless you're part of the secret i like that one more time unless you're part of the secret it's secret but if you're part of the secret it's not secret anymore there's not going to be a 666 tattooed to your forehead that's where she was coming from i said no baby i said there's people in our church that have tattoos i said your dad's even got one i said but now the bible does tell us in leviticus i think it is that you don't shouldn't put ink in your body so there is a scripture that tells you you don't need to put needles or ink in your body so don't get a tattoo but where her thought process was not exactly that was was coming from that that was the mark of the beast if you were tattooed that that was the mark of the beast well that's not what this is happening there is nobody gonna no government gonna come up and say all right well we're gonna or in the forehead or something where people can see listen if you have an idea contrary to the word of god you're already tattooed you already got the mark now god can erase that mark he can take that tattoo off but if you don't take it off then where why is it say forehead in your intelligence it didn't say your foot or your leg it said right here and in your hand what your works and your brain that's where they want you they want you work work work work work work work and then have a different thought than what god has given us that's the tattoo that's the mark of the beast and so it's not neither had they received his mark upon their forehead or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ one thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished in other words all those people that took the mark of the beast which the mark of the beast is unbelief folks it's not a mark a physical mark it's not a bar code lord of mercy when the bar codes came out oh grief everybody went to check in to see if the government came by one night black helicopter and we walk by and go [Music] i like to mess with them girls when they you know when you go across they'll get ready and i'll go that'll mess them up real good but anyway they all listen didn't they didn't people think yeah we laugh but there's everybody's like what's the mark of the beast and then now they give you the now they're gonna give you the vaccine and that's the mark of the beast not knowing they're already participating in the mark of the beast by not having the correct word of god in their heart heart and then they got to get it here first everybody okay with this i'm about to run out of voice but this is the first resurrection that's the secret one that's the one nobody's gonna know anything about right that's the secret catching away that's the no graves have to be open we just disappear because the second resurrection second death is up you under where there's thrones and then the bible tells us their book is open and out of that book will be judged the people of the earth not me and you not the born-again believers of course look blessed and holy it's he that has part in the first resurrection in other words born-again believers come up in the first resurrection no one else everybody got that same man no one else there's no foolish virgin there's no one cup of water in my name there's no justified people there's no listen this is a hard one there's no um little children that die before the because they're not born again only born-again people come up in the first resurrection that have the new birth in their soul under their messenger whoever it be paul irenaeus mark columbus or wesley or or elijah okay but the second death or the second resurrection people remember the bible says they come out of the earth they come out of the sea they've got to come out of the bottom of the sea they came out all the different places why general resurrection you don't want to be part of that general resurrection because you're going to be judged by what you did i do not want to be judged by what i did but look but they shall be priests of god so they must be pretty good people antichrist and shall reign with him 1 000 years let's go to the next one everybody all right we got to get to a point here i'm sorry but i would not have you ignorant brethren listen we're not ignorant you can't plead ignorance in this day and time not if you've sat around this church for long enough but i would not have you that's why i said the books open amen it becomes more plain listen this is not hard this is not hard to live once you get the liver inside of you because listen if the man that wrote it we know there's one man jesus christ the creator of the world he wrote the bible if he is inside of you how can they contradict when you read the bible sure there's things you don't understand but how can you say that's not right in the bible if you have the one that wrote it inside of you impossible totally impossible because you ain't got the right person inside of you that's why you're anyway i didn't want to say that but it did anyway but listen if you realize that you have that praise god if you realize that you've been to see but that your eyes have been opened oh praise god there's a lot of people that's going to be blind forever spiritually blind i'd rather be naturally blind a hundred times over than to be spiritually blind but i would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep not dead that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive there's that alive i was telling you about it alive so in other words these people have not they they're they're not part of the resurrection they're part of the calling because they're alive you got to be alive if you're dead you can you can be considered in the resurrection but if you're alive you've got to be the one that speaks it we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel and the trump of god listen the world thinks he's going to come down through the eastern skies like i said this morning park the eastern skies and have a trumpet i reckon gabriel or somebody's going to be going that's a message there's a message that's come to us a message a shout that turned our head and said wow i've been deceived all my life now i see the light that ought to make you shout [Applause] and the voice of an archangel with a trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first wow then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up rapture together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words let's go to the next scripture and then we'll stop right here behold i show you a mystery then revelation 10 7 said what in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery one mystery not mysteries the mystery of god shall be finished to me the great mystery is how god can save your soul show you the message of your hour you be in it and live it and if you have to go by the grave no problem you're going to be brought back up but the ones that are alive and remain are going to sound the trumpet gospel trumpet not sorry behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye it's the last trump for the trumpet shall sound the dead in christ shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corrupt we must put on the incorruption this mortal must put on immortality you know i was thinking just now brought to my attention you look at we talk about replacement and resurrection or change talk about the change of the body now when abraham and sarah they weren't like a cocoon or a katy did or whatever that is you know you see that thing up on the side of the tree that it split open and the new one flies out and leaves that old thing right abraham didn't roll over and his old body they have to do something with right it sounds silly but it's not replacement folks it's changing what was there it's changing dead abraham changing dead sarah back to young man and woman again so they could have a child but they had to meet the son of man first they had to meet god in human flesh a prefigure in the son of man now that wasn't jesus well that was theophany of jesus but that wasn't the one that died for us everybody understand that so see we're to be changed wow could you imagine here's abraham 99 years old sarah 89 they went to bed like this i'll get there in a minute and of course they don't have they didn't have king size uh serta sleep number thermopedic memory foam water beds they had a pallet laying on the floor with straw straw tech and can you imagine laying down at 99 they're hoping for a resurrection that's for sure but the next morning for abraham i'm making light but still that's going to happen folks i from by the word of the lord somebody in this room is going to take a body change they're going to wake up one morning or they're going to walk or they're going to be walking down the hallway and they'll be going like this and all of a sudden they're going to go oh man but what did abraham do that morning abraham turned over and went whoa i'm in bed with the wrong woman i went to bed with an 89 year old and i woke up and she's 20. sarah looks over at him and goes abraham you've changed you know what brother brown when he went across the curtain of time remember he he didn't really realize it he looked back and saw the old man but he reached up and said i got hair i don't have wrinkles right that's the truth folks that really happened and just as sure as it happened to abraham and sarah it's going to happen to me and you somebody is going to stand one day and say corruption you have met your maker i'm not taking this no more i'm not going to take this anymore i'm going to be changed now let's go to the next scripture and then we'll close musicians get ready to come revelations 4. this is where we were this morning sorry donny we didn't get any further after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven the first voice which i heard was it were of a trumpet now look after this after what after the church ages look this is the last church age number seven there were seven stars there were seven candlesticks there's no more church ages this is it we're at the end time if you don't know we're at the end time then we got a problem let me talk to you about a few things and after this i looked and behold the door was open in heaven look and the first voice which i heard was it where there's always a trumpet somewhere there's always a trumpet going off somebody's got a trumpet in their hand or somebody's getting ready to sound a trumpet what is that it's a voice what did the trumpet do it sounded to battle listen way back before there was communication if you had two million people fighting like the children of israel would have hundreds of thousands on a battlefield well they might be stretched two miles they couldn't talk to each other they listened for that trumpet and if that trumpet gave a certain sound they could charge if that trumpet gave another certain sound they couldn't charge if that trumpet gave a certain sound they had to go over so many meters and come around this way that was what a type of communication so that's what when you see trumpet in the bible it's not excuse me it's not this that's right this is a symbol now what does this do it sounds what he's blowing sometimes pretty good yeah you ain't kidding you do a good job with this thing but this right here is is an instrument used by a man to get a message to a group of people so when you see that word trumpet it's god through somebody bringing you a message this is the prophets what would you think isaiah would do when isaiah was this thing right here and isaiah was a young man but isaiah stood up one day and said a virgin shall conceive wow his wife was probably behind him pulling his coattail going where'd you get that he said i don't know but it's what somebody told me to say that's right it's what god told me because he was blowing the note right through my soul and the voice came out the other end a virgin shall conceive that was a trumpet same way with this right here i heard as it were a trumpet talking with me a trumpet doesn't talk so it was somebody talking saying come up hither come up to another dimension come up to another place because you're going in a rapture come up hither and i will show these things which must be hereafter and i immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne not thrones a throne was set in heaven and one sat on that throne one not three one right john is the top of the bride right so he went up in revelations 4 in a rapture he took a rapture by that voice that talked to him now what do we when the last trumpet sounds yes we've had a message that last trumpet has sounded what are you going to do about it some have given uncertain sounds yes in the hand of a skilled person it's beautiful if i picked it up you'd hear nothing but spit yeah uncertain right but that's the same instrument it was just blown by somebody that didn't know what they were doing but it's also blown that was me i'm talking about but it's also blown by somebody that knows how to hold it a professional and you better listen to what comes out to end because it's true today i've told you the truth as far as i know i've told you the truth of god and what you do with it is your business because we're all free moral agents we can choose to accept or reject so choose you this day who you'll serve let's stand our feet so the bride's going to take a rapture we didn't we didn't use our chart but the bride's going to take a rapture the church is not the church is going to stay here those that have received the mark of the beast will not go in the first resurrection right if you've received the mark of the beast you're not going into first resurrection but if you receive the seal of god you will go in the first resurrection we'll start next couple of weeks now brother pray for brother hayek coming but matthew 17 says after six days peter james and john was took up to a high mountain and was transfigured in his face shown as a son and behold there appeared unto them moses and elijah talking with them that's where we get to because the first resurrection once we are resurrected and get out of here those two witnesses are going to go to the jews according to revelations 13 amen or revelations 11 3 through 7. i'm going to give power to my two witness and they shall prophesy a thousand 200 in three score days to continue the plan of redemption for the jews the plan of redemption for the gentiles is over listen they ain't none of this left behind stuff that's right that's false that's the devil if you miss the first resurrection you ain't coming up and getting saved you're going to the second resurrection you're going to have to give an account for what you did on the earth amen and you don't have much of a chance when you get there sorry because if i'm judged by my works i'm going to hell anyway right but see i took his judgment he took my judgment and now i stand with him and if he's a judge now what does that make me a judge if he's a judge now what that make me it makes me a judge all right let's sing a song god bless you thank you for hanging around oh some glad morning when this life is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh like a bird from [Music] what's gonna carry you home what you got inside of you you gotta have it in here [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] i'll be raptured by [Music] to the world we're crazy because we're not normal and that means crazy but they called god himself in human flesh they called jesus belgium they called him a wine bibber they said you hang around centers and prostitutes well who are you he was god in human flesh and that same god by the new birth is inside of you he's in your human flesh and he's going to make you act different than the world that's why folks it's not that we suppress our women and suppress our men and suppress our feelings because the bible tells us jesus said you'll be in this world but you'll not be of this world that's right and i'll protect you because i'll be with you even in you so see if it's not an inner work it's no good anyway that's it i mean if i have to remind june to not cut her hair every day [Music] so the same way with god if god has to remind us no get the one that wrote the bible inside of you he can't do anything but lead you and guide you into all truth he can't go against his own word i you know i'll take what the bible says okay amen over anything that's contrary to the word of god it doesn't matter who it comes from like daddy's always said it come from a dumb donkey one time spoke to a prophet a dumb donkey spoke to a prophet and told balaam well he was a false prophet but god was telling him don't go this way don't go this way don't go this way and he finally had the donkey had to talk and tell the prophet why because his backslid let's don't have an animal to tell us that we're backslid amen you pray to god this week that this service next week will be it'll be wonderful wednesday night it's going to be good already brother bob's going to speak for us but um just remember the word of the lord it's true we may be crazy but that's what you know paul stood up one day and he said on in the way that's called heresy yes he said i worship the god of my father i worship this god call me crazy i don't care doesn't matter to me i want to be different listen if you if you ain't gonna see never mind let's close god bless you let's pray our heads the heavenly father we pray lord that you'd sanctify us for this journey that we're on lord let truth be told let all else be false lord let your word be upheld lord you said it would never return void but it would accomplish exactly what it said it would accomplish and lord your thoughts lord they are eternal and father we're just trying in a human way of hearing this first three dimensions lord of of death and sorrow we're trying our best lord to get people to see you and that there is something different about us there is a god that'll never change there is a bible that doesn't have 7 000 different interpretations it only has one and lord you're the interpreter and lord if you'll just please this week lord we pray that you'd give us a good week all of us brother dale all the way down to each one of us lord give us a good week today this week we come back together lord saturday and with the youth lord we're trying our best to give the youth some time that they'll not be forgotten lord because we were all used at one time and some of us are still used in the gospel yes so we pray that you bless brother hyatt lord in weekend service be with the youth lord if there'd be any questions in their heart lord i pray that you'd have them write them down and and lord somebody will answer that question for them lord we thank you god for everything that you give us we thank
