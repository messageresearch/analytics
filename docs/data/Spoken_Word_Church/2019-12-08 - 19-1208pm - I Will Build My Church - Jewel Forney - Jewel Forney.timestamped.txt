[27:58] one preciate Bob's and everyone here
[28:01] today and just looking for the holy
[28:03] spirit that they give us what we have
[28:05] near similar even to places in the
[28:08] scripture this evening Matthew 7:21
[28:13] through 27 I didn't have it all wrote
[28:15] down then and I was over read Matthew
[28:18] 2:16 chapter the Matthew and I will read
[28:22] all the way down from the 16th to the
[28:24] 19th and everything so and we'll begin
[28:27] reading at the 21st verse down through
[28:31] the 27 right here the Bible says not
[28:36] everyone that says unto me Lord Lord
[28:40] shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he
[28:42] that does the will of my father which is
[28:44] in heaven for many many will say to me
[28:49] in that day Lord Lord have not we
[28:51] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[28:53] cast out devils and in thy name done
[28:56] many wonderful words and then I would
[29:01] profess unto them I never knew you
[29:03] depart from me that work iniquity
[29:07] therefore never would ever see here
[29:11] these sands of Mines and does them I
[29:14] will liken unto him as a
[29:16] wise man which built his house upon a
[29:18] rock and the rain descended the floods
[29:22] came and the winds blew and beat up
[29:24] under upon that house and it fell not
[29:28] for it was founded upon a rock the next
[29:33] one says and everyone that heard the
[29:36] sounds of my hands it does them not
[29:38] shall be likened unto a man a foolish
[29:42] man which built his house upon sand and
[29:47] the rain this is and the flood came and
[29:50] the winds blew and beat upon that house
[29:53] and it fell and great was the fall all
[29:58] of it
[29:59] a few 16 chapters started 260 verse down
[30:05] through the nineteenth and this is her
[30:09] Jesus beginning the accident no new
[30:11] questions in here and some of you
[30:13] dancers said how the Christ the Son of
[30:16] the Living God and Jesus he renamed in
[30:20] and jesus answered and said unto unto
[30:23] Him blessed art our salmon born of Jonah
[30:25] for flesh and blood has not revealed it
[30:28] unto thee but my father which is in
[30:30] heaven and I say also unto deed thou art
[30:35] Peter and upon this rock I will build my
[30:38] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[30:42] prevail against it the nineteenth verse
[30:47] and then I directed and I would give
[30:50] unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
[30:52] heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on
[30:56] earth shall be bound in heaven and
[30:58] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[31:00] shall be loosed in heaven
[31:02] let's pray i gracious father lord help
[31:06] me one more time you're my body mine
[31:09] mine and my spirit my soul to you father
[31:12] help me O God to get myself out of the
[31:14] way Lord but as I give you all my script
[31:17] for this service father take full
[31:19] control of this service
[31:21] in Jesus Christ's name we pray father
[31:23] amen I bless you maybe see the one
[31:26] moment thank the Lord for the reading of
[31:28] the word of God just this evening right
[31:31] we find here we see the scene over here
[31:35] but we find here dad we see the scene
[31:38] open here
[31:39] Jesus dealing with he what howdy bill in
[31:42] the house and what you build at all and
[31:45] at the words that we finally tell one
[31:47] man built his house upon a rock and
[31:49] another man billions out upon saying I
[31:52] my title years I would be on my church
[31:56] in other words and I look at the
[31:58] standard I study this out I've been
[32:00] thinking I said you know really build
[32:03] something here we must have a foundation
[32:05] how do you just don't go build a house
[32:08] on saying even though saying is a rock
[32:11] dog divided substance Halloween hit it
[32:14] way
[32:14] ain't none what wouldn't you go to the
[32:16] beach if you had a beach in the wind
[32:18] beginning to blow saying go everywhere
[32:20] but when you go to the Grand Canyon in
[32:22] the wind blowing it still setting how do
[32:26] you don't work on that rocket going the
[32:27] world others so that we realize here
[32:30] that we must have I have the correct
[32:32] foundation to build on I built a
[32:35] faithful and I'm beginning to think I'll
[32:37] say you know God go to a vegan village
[32:40] church he gonna build a church just like
[32:43] him
[32:43] how do you know we gonna have a
[32:45] foundation if we gonna lay a foundation
[32:47] for church that foundation he that I
[32:50] build my church
[32:52] you know bit man try to build his own
[32:55] church and it was a problem a I'll bill
[32:57] your own idea or bill your only thought
[33:00] debtors are dead if that wasn't probably
[33:02] but with God build his church the gates
[33:06] of Hell cannot stand against that church
[33:08] and it was so we you begin to look here
[33:10] I begin to think on them things right
[33:12] there and I begin to realize her and the
[33:14] gays al you call God want us to come to
[33:17] the point
[33:17] haloo discharged right girl will be a
[33:20] glorious church be able to stand and get
[33:23] all the blows of the devil
[33:25] you know some people say we're brothers
[33:27] you'll be in this church right
[33:29] how do in other words the churches go to
[33:31] a store but a church they've been built
[33:33] by Christ does not lose its foundation
[33:37] honey don't worry don't worry
[33:39] when the wind blow ordered they said the
[33:43] probably because that when a tree it's
[33:44] been attacked by a solid foundation we
[33:50] know we're beginning to rock a tree and
[33:51] then we're beginning to come up against
[33:53] that tree you say what do that tree do
[33:55] and begin to dig deeper and the roots
[33:58] beginning to get a scrub aho your trial
[34:00] do not stop you your trials help you how
[34:04] do you know where your trial don't stop
[34:05] your child in a way of you know where
[34:08] you stand in the word your trousers ever
[34:10] you how do we go through tribulations
[34:12] and trial
[34:13] how do not just to say well I need to
[34:16] give up the devil fight me this way and
[34:18] is that what is doing god has proven his
[34:21] revelation here proving the foundation
[34:24] that you build on how do another one go
[34:27] to the enemy come in like a flood but
[34:29] you'll learn the trust of Jesus Christ
[34:32] so I began to think on them same
[34:34] foundation you know foundation must have
[34:36] something to give us support how do you
[34:39] know the foundation must have something
[34:41] to give it support how ludus searching
[34:43] you know you build a church you you you
[34:45] all stablish the church the church it to
[34:47] put it in this putting it on this
[34:49] foundation of this piece of ground and
[34:51] what builds the church but you did
[34:53] you've put things in order you put
[34:54] diggings and oil and trustees and on how
[34:57] anything do you got elders that's a
[34:58] mature way to do it build the foundation
[35:01] for this church and then what is your
[35:02] this church a bit standing all the years
[35:05] are not no years got out of 25 23 first
[35:08] time I come here you done 58 now so you
[35:11] can see I look at being so but she won't
[35:13] say but it was built to stand
[35:15] halu that way it was built to stand so
[35:18] now do we go through all the trials in
[35:20] this truck don't doubt been through the
[35:22] same matter trial and tribulation that
[35:24] we all go through up and down the light
[35:26] but something keep holding on you said
[35:29] what did that that's not you holding on
[35:31] it's God the Word of God
[35:34] by the power Toni go it's only you solid
[35:36] be another when I begin to think on them
[35:39] things that I would live here and Big W
[35:41] were telling Peter he's at Peter about
[35:43] this rock I'll build my church
[35:45] I'm gonna build this church in such a
[35:48] way how do you did Peter write that the
[35:51] gates of Hell will fight this church but
[35:54] the gates of Hell won't prevail and I'm
[35:57] not going to give you a kid will give
[35:58] you keys I'm gonna give you keys in
[36:02] other words I'm not going to give you
[36:04] one revelation I won't give you a
[36:06] buttons of Revelation how do you I'll
[36:08] never give you enough keys here that
[36:10] when the enemy are coming like a flood
[36:12] you got a key to ever something ever so
[36:14] cursed and you go unlock every door that
[36:16] God got I will give you the key Peter
[36:19] how that God will give you the key to
[36:21] revelation for healing I will give you a
[36:23] revelation for delivery I will give you
[36:25] a revelation for salvation I will give
[36:28] you the key Peter uglier than the gates
[36:30] of Hell will not be able to stop you how
[36:33] do you go say they don't even got a key
[36:34] to the house I've been saving up in
[36:37] script from his old house he had no
[36:39] foundation he's a body of our bondage
[36:43] the pit he have no foundation the bride
[36:46] got a foundation and foundation is built
[36:49] upon the revelation of Jesus Christ say
[36:52] yesterday that I've ever had were the
[36:55] foundation ears I let them script look
[36:58] at it raw I look at soldier soul said
[37:01] adrenaline songs 11 verse 3 say if the
[37:04] Foundation's be destroyed what can the
[37:07] righteous do we got no foundation
[37:10] this message was built on the foundation
[37:14] of a prophetic anointing
[37:17] they said brother Brandon could not
[37:20] build his own foundation
[37:22] he built the same foundation that Paul
[37:25] built that why he said when he act
[37:27] brother Ben he's I preach what Paul
[37:29] preached how do I become Paul preached
[37:32] the revelation of Jesus Christ and Paul
[37:35] David
[37:36] man help me preach any other gospel and
[37:39] what I have preached to you let it be a
[37:41] curse Holly if we preach another gospel
[37:44] let why even preach the foundation in
[37:47] Jesus Christ he built the revelation on
[37:49] the foundation of Jesus gray how do you
[37:51] even know if that one polgár's say when
[37:54] doing trials come his way and in
[37:56] tribulation coming away then why Paul
[37:58] would say I am persuaded that nothing
[38:01] could separate me from the love of God
[38:03] what does it grudge you because it was a
[38:04] foundation it's a foundation you built
[38:08] on and we all got every we got to have a
[38:10] foundation that we won't be able to
[38:12] stand
[38:12] Holly code to Revelation 21 verse 47 and
[38:16] the walls of the city head the names of
[38:18] the Twelve Apostles and of the Lamb
[38:21] how destroyed as a foundation here as it
[38:24] doesn't revelation that keyboard from
[38:26] day to day we got something to stand on
[38:28] how do we got something that's solid we
[38:31] go in a word we know when everything
[38:33] come against us we got to know what we
[38:36] stand that man that built his house old
[38:38] saying what you got so many people then
[38:42] blow it around
[38:43] hell you don't know what it come from
[38:45] how they don't know where they going
[38:48] but we know what we go in other words
[38:51] they never what you know I tell myself
[38:53] you know man we some time we had them we
[38:55] had to might have to move out to do
[38:57] something to get a word that a hold of
[38:59] because you to remember her we gave we
[39:02] got a help Jack we gotta have a stronger
[39:04] revelation now how do did that we had
[39:06] that we had on the Luther when we had to
[39:09] have a scroll the revelations everywhere
[39:11] and underwear underwear now we need all
[39:13] we know for revelation we need this wine
[39:16] the lay up the longer you keep it the
[39:18] scroll bigot why does not get weak in
[39:22] age why gets conquer that what some of
[39:26] you still been sending 50 or 40 years
[39:28] and all this because what your
[39:30] revelation got scrub till you learn how
[39:33] to give it all to Jesus Christ I
[39:35] learning how to lean on him and we don't
[39:38] give up in this age right here so we
[39:40] gotta it must have a foundation here it
[39:43] must be strong in network and it must
[39:45] possess the gate of his enemy in this
[39:48] revelation must take over and that way
[39:52] that were you fighting the devil we're
[39:53] not fighting the devil we're just going
[39:55] out there we fighting the devil with
[39:56] divine revelation
[39:58] Christ is in full control how do you
[40:00] even know we sometimes we don't realize
[40:02] it but we we sometimes say try to
[40:05] blinders and get us not to looking at
[40:07] circumstances but circle says don't stop
[40:09] revelation how do you know you know even
[40:12] uh probably God's easy to determine
[40:14] Allah he said long as you confess you
[40:16] save you say just something as simple as
[40:20] long as you hold on to your revelation
[40:23] I'm saying how do don't let the devil
[40:25] change your mind about your yo-yo the
[40:28] work of grace that Christ gave you Lo
[40:29] and you confess you save you are saying
[40:31] don't don't change your confession stay
[40:35] the same confess the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:37] and believe in your heart let's not say
[40:39] be you are say hundred salvation come to
[40:42] believe it and accepting the word of
[40:44] Jesus Christ that is not nothing you do
[40:47] we gotta have a foundation I looked at
[40:50] the fire here we find him when Abraham
[40:53] went up and did what he did offered up
[40:55] as it God told Abraham you're blessed
[40:58] that blessing not only do Abraham but to
[41:01] his seed not see to you see Holly when
[41:05] we come out there that blessing here
[41:07] come on for Abraham it come down through
[41:09] the lineage and all of our churches of
[41:12] god that's blessed by the baptism of the
[41:15] Holy Ghost be overcomers
[41:16] God and create a brazier Gupta's age to
[41:20] be overcome not wowsie wowsie Woo's
[41:25] happy that you had people today and so
[41:28] it's so hard for people to be happy how
[41:31] do you know they saw other people to be
[41:32] happy today because you know there's so
[41:34] much going on and so much in the world
[41:36] going on it's so much here it's so much
[41:38] stuff it did we pick up the dumb
[41:41] the news and everything is going on in
[41:44] the world all kinds of things going on
[41:46] in the world
[41:46] howling and if you look at all this
[41:48] stuff you can't get discouraged in a way
[41:50] Hello Dolly lies it them it told in this
[41:53] a bit but we got to get our eyes on
[41:55] Jesus Holly when Peter plea remember her
[41:58] Peter
[41:59] Logan Peter had the word in front of him
[42:01] and he will look at dead at the word
[42:03] Holly we had a foundation he could walk
[42:05] on water right now we know that don't
[42:09] happen in reality
[42:11] never don't happen in reality so for him
[42:14] to walk on water he had to get away get
[42:16] his eyes on Jesus and when he got his
[42:19] eyes on Jesus the revelation that he had
[42:21] the water become a foundation and Peter
[42:24] got off the boat and begin to walk on
[42:26] water but it's dead the water was now
[42:28] holding in the world where he looked
[42:30] into Jesus Jesus had the power to take
[42:33] the water it make it become concrete but
[42:37] the circumstances was the wind be
[42:39] getting the blow it will be getting the
[42:42] blowed stones beginning to rise just
[42:44] like I said in other words when he did
[42:46] see Jesus is the foundation so when the
[42:48] store begin to blow the sweating wind
[42:50] began to blow this way Peter begin to
[42:52] Bank and begin to look around and get
[42:54] his eyes off Jesus and when he got his
[42:56] eyes off Jesus the foundation that he
[42:59] was running to let go holler then he
[43:01] started to say it he cried out save me
[43:03] Lord and cheetah reached down and picked
[43:05] him up
[43:06] how do people do what we got to do we
[43:08] got to overcome in his age is they ever
[43:13] gone that Satan God is trained on human
[43:17] what soldier is such about it people say
[43:20] this is not a band of ease right here
[43:24] this is not just we fighting against
[43:26] world we fighting against demonic worlds
[43:28] and demonic powers and and unseen forces
[43:31] all the time man battles just a neck
[43:34] going up but what keeping us serving God
[43:37] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[43:39] it were just sort of that is you know
[43:41] now let us look at our foundation we
[43:44] gotta examine our foundation see will it
[43:46] stand the test yeah you build a
[43:50] foundation with a crack in it
[43:52] if you put a foundation with a crack in
[43:54] it next thing you know you got a plant
[43:56] growing up through it
[43:57] hello government light he don't care
[43:59] what it see they will light him for that
[44:01] see they're gonna be a reservation so
[44:03] you know that is just that way in other
[44:05] words I've seen some put some cracks in
[44:07] it but if you got a good foundation a
[44:09] good solid foundation it ain't nothing
[44:11] gonna move that foundation so that what
[44:13] we got it that's what we got to be sure
[44:15] is the message of foundation to you and
[44:19] when I say the message Jesus Christ was
[44:22] saying yesterday today and forever
[44:24] brother Brandon brought a message not
[44:27] himself he turned your heart back to
[44:29] Jesus how do you know where he'd say I
[44:32] preach what Paul bridge so what the ball
[44:34] preach Paul preach Christ how do you so
[44:36] he I come with the same revelation that
[44:39] turn your back this is not no mysterious
[44:41] revelation how do you the raptures not a
[44:43] mysterious pain the raptures receiving
[44:46] the baptism in the Holy Ghost if the
[44:48] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[44:49] dead if it's in your body your body got
[44:52] to change because it probably if the
[44:54] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[44:56] dead they make the rapture mysterious
[44:58] the Matt rapture will you receive the
[45:00] baptism no no you go you got everything
[45:02] you need for a rapture have you got all
[45:05] the power you need to get out of here
[45:07] how do it would change your life quicken
[45:09] your mortal body I got the paint on
[45:11] inside to change my body a butterfly
[45:14] caterpillar does not need anything to
[45:16] change him all you gotta do is keep me
[45:20] keep me holy doors you do need because
[45:25] the power to change him within him
[45:27] because he's not just a caterpillar he's
[45:30] the mystery of a butterfly so the power
[45:32] that's on the inside of him with one day
[45:35] taking off desert here we come a bug
[45:38] that's crawling on her will come a
[45:40] heavily flying bird that's a power
[45:44] that's already and that's what your
[45:46] father God put that in you the rapture
[45:49] is already in you everything you need to
[45:51] get out of here is already in you once
[45:54] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[45:55] Spirit
[45:56] now you
[45:56] so people don't preach on it no more but
[45:58] no people wanted to be intellectualism
[46:00] so you didn't come to learn God you come
[46:02] to be God's we didn't we didn't go we
[46:06] don't go to church just to say well how
[46:08] would the church I'm learning about God
[46:09] how do we going to church to become that
[46:11] word we go to church to hear that word
[46:13] and accept that word and keep eating on
[46:17] that world into our bodies obeyed it how
[46:20] do you know what so we find here the
[46:22] foundation here now beginning to realize
[46:24] well you say brother Joel you say what
[46:27] what do we need to get out of here all
[46:30] you need is the real experience with the
[46:32] baptism that holy go now you know not
[46:36] just not just a day at work here not
[46:39] just a day when they hear they was dumb
[46:41] guys that win in the upper room when
[46:44] they win he never rule no guys win in
[46:46] the upper room basically afraid of the
[46:50] people
[46:50] Fred of the public here they go they run
[46:53] they go set up a room
[46:54] her name was in the upper room everybody
[46:56] was Cowboys in other words everybody was
[46:59] cowards
[47:00] how do they heard Jesus preach Holly but
[47:02] they didn't have enough faith to stand
[47:04] up against the public they didn't would
[47:06] enough faith to stand up and face to
[47:07] people he was up in the upper over to
[47:10] about ten day Holly and all of a sudden
[47:12] there come a sign for heaven like a
[47:14] rushing Mighty Wind and it filled how 21
[47:17] and when they received baptism nother
[47:20] holy go they come outside on a
[47:22] foundation of a boat as they start
[47:25] preaching Jesus later preaching the
[47:27] power the Holy Ghost that's simmering go
[47:29] we have not but such as we have we give
[47:32] to you in the name of Jesus Christ rise
[47:35] up it won't what they become the words
[47:37] they become Christ the Holy Ghost living
[47:40] in a body that way this message is there
[47:42] it to put Christ with skin on it we got
[47:45] to get this message back with skin on it
[47:47] honey we got to put we got to put Christ
[47:50] back where you belong then you know we
[47:52] prayer we pray the Old Testament proud o
[47:55] how Father which art in heaven hallowed
[47:59] be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[48:01] that's Old Testament it has Old
[48:04] Testament prayer they would hit eight

[48:17] in you that kingdom of God is living on
[48:20] his side of you how did he not God he
[48:23] need to come he's already in you right
[48:25] now the kingdom of God is living through
[48:27] you how do we gotta recognize who the
[48:30] seals that got to control our life we
[48:32] got a record at this wooden since they
[48:34] kept a seal there by the baptismal holy
[48:36] go whenever devil he'll ever spared a
[48:38] deal then let loose oh you are you still
[48:41] holding on that's the Holy Ghost he's a
[48:44] brother you've been preaching a lot on
[48:46] the Holy Ghost that's what's the problem
[48:47] man ain't nobody give me I find him I
[48:51] found out that people deal the people
[48:54] haven't got a message but they ain't got
[48:56] the person to go with it how do you
[48:58] don't worry but you can't over just come
[49:00] to devil and I believe the message you
[49:01] better had a person meta message have
[49:04] you better know the author of the Bible
[49:05] how do you never work so big in the
[49:07] little domains right there foundation
[49:10] I'm foundation here we had a so we begin
[49:13] to realize he says here then he gonna
[49:16] elevate us and we gonna become kings and
[49:18] priests well you got a new name now
[49:22] healthy he's gonna make us kings and
[49:24] priests but Jesus says Jesus has a
[49:27] foundation and that foundation have
[49:29] power in it and on how will you know
[49:31] what kind of power will you have except
[49:34] you get a revelation what kind of power
[49:36] he had you know you know how can you
[49:38] understand who you are and what you all
[49:40] be doing if you don't know what he's
[49:42] doing so there was let us look at
[49:45] something he done let me look at ax T in
[49:49] verse 38 exchange chapter and verse 38
[49:55] verse let watch what Jesus did you know
[50:00] he looked dead at real quick and
[50:03] exchanged Bertoni now Bible says here
[50:08] God God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[50:13] what
[50:15] holy goes you gotta have the same person
[50:19] you gotta have the same anointing how do
[50:21] you regard to an end if God knowing into
[50:24] God knowing that Jesus is with the holy
[50:26] go the vessel hollow in the Spirit of
[50:28] God come on the vessel and knowing with
[50:30] the holy God and with what and they were
[50:33] any who went about doing what and or
[50:37] what what with the what
[50:43] how do God was what with him so now we
[50:47] realize Jesus did this and this was the
[50:51] foundation that God anointed Jesus with
[50:53] what you for having you deed demon
[50:56] spirits they've been hanging around have
[50:58] no right they're building God property

[51:26] the phase at on earth and leave them on
[51:28] earth I don't talk about you cast your
[51:31] mouth how did Jesus say that's the power
[51:33] of God he wants you to use you know we
[51:36] told so many times we put things in
[51:38] heaven there don't blow in heaven oh
[51:41] well I'll do what ad ever done this to
[51:44] me I can't overcome I need to get work
[51:47] that ain't in heaven that language that
[51:50] language didn't come from heaven that

[52:07] trying to hit trying to get a now help
[52:09] fire faith in the Word of God to the
[52:12] point that we could change our body it's
[52:15] about the church because we got to fight
[52:17] against so much in a human part of us
[52:20] the human part of us and it was so we
[52:22] begin to realize her and he's I build my
[52:24] church and the gates of Hell shell

[1:05:41] over and I know that this power that was
[1:05:44] holding me was not the power of a human
[1:05:47] screen but it was a power of a demonic
[1:05:50] power called drugs and different things
[1:05:54] that couldn't break that on my own
[1:05:56] I needed a power I needed something that
[1:06:00] was more powerful than what I this grip
[1:06:03] has got in my life and the only thing I
[1:06:05] could find that could break this power
[1:06:07] was Jesus Christ the same yesterday
