[7:33] we thank you
[7:33] your word is declared he is healed and
[7:37] we believe it we thank you goddess each
[7:39] one now as we talk about you you come on
[7:42] the scene to answer all of our thoughts
[7:44] and questions in Jesus name we're going
[7:50] to Ephesians 2 and then we'll go to
[7:53] Roman's 10 seasons 2 in Romans 10 we're
[7:59] going to verse 19 I wish you what I
[8:02] sitting there reading this morning I
[8:04] wish you would read the entire Ephesians
[8:08] 2 you know coming down to it but to
[8:10] bring it to a points is talking about us
[8:13] see now therefore you're no more
[8:17] strangers and foreigners because that's
[8:19] what he's covering how that we Gentiles
[8:21] were not part of the kingdom we were you
[8:24] know and all like that alright there are
[8:27] no more strangers and foreigners but
[8:29] fellow-citizens with the Saints and of
[8:32] the household of God and a build upon
[8:35] the foundation of the apostles and
[8:37] prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the
[8:41] chief Cornerstone in whom all the
[8:43] building fitly framed together groweth
[8:47] unto the holy temple in the Lord in whom
[8:51] you also are builded together for an
[8:54] habitation of God through the spirit all
[8:57] right then we go to Roman's 10 because
[9:03] this is a very familiar scripture with
[9:06] us but when we get to a point right
[9:08] Romans 10 1 through 11 brethren my
[9:12] heart's desire and prayer to God for
[9:15] Israel is that they might be saved for I
[9:18] bear them record that to have a zeal of
[9:20] God but not according to knowledge
[9:24] now not head knowledge true knowledge
[9:27] right they had great knowledge and I'm
[9:31] talking about that it's all about true
[9:33] knowledge Holy Ghost knowledge all right
[9:35] but not according to knowledge for they
[9:38] being ignorant of God's righteousness
[9:39] and going about to establish their own
[9:43] righteousness have not submitted
[9:46] themselves unto the righteousness of God
[9:49] for Christ is the end of the law for
[9:52] righteousness to every one that
[9:54] believeth Ramos's describes the
[9:57] righteousness which is of the law the
[9:59] demand which doeth those things shall
[10:02] live by them but the righteousness which
[10:06] is of faith speaketh on this wise now
[10:09] what does the righteousness which is of
[10:11] faith safe all right say not in thine
[10:17] heart who shall ascend into heaven that
[10:22] is to bring Christ down from above or
[10:24] who showed this in the notice don't say
[10:27] that don't do it or who shall descend
[10:30] into the deep that is to bring up Christ
[10:32] again from the dead but what saith what
[10:37] saith the righteousness now which is a
[10:39] faith the word is nigh thee even in thy
[10:44] mouth and then the heart that is the
[10:46] Word of Faith which we preach if thou
[10:50] shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord
[10:52] Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart
[10:55] that God has raised him from the dead
[10:57] thou shalt be saved for with a heart man
[11:02] believeth unto righteousness and with
[11:04] the mouth confession is made unto
[11:07] salvation for the scripture says
[11:11] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[11:14] ashamed you may be seated Lord at his
[11:17] blessing to the reading of the word now
[11:24] a broader little message last Sunday
[11:26] morning trying to talk about them the
[11:30] rejecting of the cornerstone and you
[11:35] know I just couldn't get away from it so
[11:38] we're going to stay with that talk this
[11:41] morning to try to continue own because
[11:45] now here is I thought we talked about a
[11:47] cornerstone to to young kids and people
[11:50] that don't understand it's simply
[11:53] talking about that Jesus Christ is the
[11:58] cornerstone
[11:59] he's the stone of all of our everything
[12:01] we have is based in Jesus Christ all
[12:04] right and see it requires that we have
[12:07] the new birth to talk about us being in
[12:11] that part of you know understanding the
[12:16] cornerstone so what do you think about
[12:18] the cornerstone and I kept asking the
[12:23] question I want to keep asking it you
[12:25] know they rejected the cornerstone right
[12:32] all right could it be possible that we
[12:35] would reject the cornerstone no no we
[12:40] just listen to what I'm saying and think
[12:44] about it all right do we know for a
[12:49] certainty that there's no salvation
[12:51] outside of Jesus Christ all right and
[12:55] being no salvation outside of Jesus
[12:58] Christ then we know that he according to
[13:00] the Bible is that stone that was spoken
[13:03] of throughout the Old Testament the all
[13:07] of that bringing it down to talking
[13:09] about Jesus Christ all right but now why
[13:14] would it be why would it be that people
[13:19] who studied the word all of their life
[13:24] you know the priests in designs
[13:26] especially counting them and why would
[13:31] it be that they would reject him when he
[13:33] came now do you believe he came
[13:37] according to the word you know now what
[13:44] about coming according to the word in
[13:46] other words you got a written book you
[13:49] know a written book that tells you the
[13:52] whole story and that's the only book
[13:56] you're reading they didn't have Greer's
[13:58] almanacs and all kind of things back
[14:02] then you know they had the scrolls they
[14:04] didn't have all of the ideas of mankind
[14:07] and and the schools and that day was
[14:11] supposed to be the teachers of the Word
[14:15] of God
[14:16] huh and why would they reject it why
[14:23] would they reject Jesus Christ when he
[14:26] came what do you think about that what
[14:35] would be the reason that you would
[14:36] reject something that the books you read
[14:40] are emphatically stating what would take
[14:44] place they were looking for a messiah
[14:52] right because they believed the word
[14:57] spoke of the coming Messiah and they
[15:03] would believe that that Messiah would be
[15:05] God in human flesh
[15:12] because they could read the word then
[15:20] Jesus standing before them could say
[15:23] show me were I didn't come according to
[15:27] the word that I didn't do what the word
[15:30] said I would do you realize the point
[15:36] the seriousness of it now watch this in
[15:41] a minute we'll get down to ourselves
[15:42] because we say look you know a nice
[15:45] reason I read that scripture because I'm
[15:48] honest I'm
[15:51] after 50 years being in this message I'm
[15:54] beginning to be able to read that
[15:56] scripture because I heard that scripture
[16:05] read so many times and it was read and
[16:12] interpreted as being what all you got to
[16:16] do is believe in your heart and confess
[16:22] with your mouth and you're saved well
[16:29] you need to read it a little bit because
[16:31] it does that say you shall be but you
[16:34] know beside the point do you believe
[16:39] that everybody that believes in their
[16:42] heart and confess with their mouth is
[16:45] saved ain't talking about really truly
[16:50] believing I'm talking about do you
[16:52] believe that's because if you believe
[16:55] you believe Jesus Christ come and died
[16:59] and you believe that he died for your
[17:02] sins and you accepting him as your
[17:06] Savior and then you confess with your
[17:10] mouth does that mean you're saved what
[17:15] else could we do that's true but does it
[17:18] mean that you're saved why is it that
[17:21] everybody's not saved it does that you
[17:25] agree I mean any problem now with that
[17:29] situation or illustration I'm trying to
[17:31] give is you know yourself you've seen a
[17:35] lot of people make great confessions go
[17:38] to church and divide for a little while
[17:41] and then fall away right well what's
[17:50] wrong with the Bible it says if you
[17:53] believe in your heart confess with your
[17:55] mouth you shall be saved what's wrong
[17:58] maybe it's the way we believe
[18:06] as I said they were looking for and the
[18:09] Bible is specific about the things that
[18:12] would happen if you know the history of
[18:14] Israel they had many different
[18:21] interpretations of the word maybe one
[18:27] group would say he's coming into babying
[18:29] now that's hardly used at all but we'll
[18:33] say that that does bleed what the others
[18:36] believe that he was coming is a great
[18:37] ruler the others believe that he was
[18:41] coming as God upon the earth many many
[18:47] many different beliefs about one Bible
[18:57] you remember how I was trying to
[18:59] illustrate it like Sunday there you know
[19:01] it always bothered me back there in the
[19:03] Baptist Church that I hear so many
[19:07] confessions of that's Romans 10 and I'd
[19:11] see so many people that would abide for
[19:14] a little while and then they would walk
[19:17] away do you really know that too so it's
[19:21] not a he's a way legs wouldn't believer
[19:24] as well there was a maybe we'll get to
[19:28] it after I word that Jesus was talking
[19:30] to them about the cornerstone and and
[19:33] that revival says right about our and
[19:34] many believed on him and you know what
[19:39] he said about and he said and you
[19:42] rejected me right and said you rejected
[19:48] me is that well yet it says that they
[19:51] believed what brother down all it is you
[19:56] just you believe and you confess and
[20:01] you're saved well why is it that
[20:05] everybody that believes in confesses is
[20:07] not saying I don't dilly-dally with me
[20:14] in lines of well I just believed enough
[20:16] to get
[20:17] dividing the Luna let's don't worry
[20:18] about ads you you get tied up in your
[20:21] terminologies and ideas and you've
[20:23] missed the whole point how could it be
[20:28] that you could receive the genuine new
[20:30] birth and then the word come forth and
[20:36] you reject that word you said no that's
[20:44] impossible to do no that's not even
[20:48] possible
[20:52] it may be wrong over at the house but
[20:55] and it may take a while for you to come
[20:58] around the channel to be led back into
[21:01] you know but it does - right tell me you
[21:08] claim the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[21:10] before you ever heard of this message
[21:11] and I must say that I believe that but
[21:15] my point is is why when you heard the
[21:17] message did you reject it no no I
[21:21] believed it a minute I heard it well
[21:22] then you just lied to solve the problem
[21:26] no problem
[21:28] no arguments for nobody me you all of us
[21:32] we fought the message when we heard it
[21:37] right why because it was contrary to
[21:42] what we had heard it was contrary to
[21:45] them teaching us that all you got to do
[21:48] is believe we'll get back to it analyze
[21:54] part of the message but remember you
[21:56] said well I've accepted Jesus Christ as
[21:58] my savior and it's his responsibility to
[22:04] take care of that but has he accepted
[22:10] you
[22:14] now that puts it a different category
[22:17] having I've done everything he said for
[22:19] me to do well don't you think the
[22:24] Pharisees don't you think those people
[22:25] had done everything that they knew to do
[22:29] as waiting on the Messiah because
[22:31] altogether irregardless of how you they
[22:36] believed him to be or what it would be
[22:38] they all had to believe the Jews that
[22:41] there was a coming Messiah you agree
[22:44] with that no matter how they figured it
[22:48] out to be riding on a horse or doing
[22:50] this or coming
[22:51] they still believed in the coming
[22:54] Messiah they still believe today in the
[22:56] coming Messiah but why did they reject
[23:01] him when he came as I said you know -
[23:10] you got to listen I know twice - that
[23:13] message getting back to see if I could
[23:15] continue on it this he's coming back so
[23:18] would you stay with that part what about
[23:23] people who had studied the word all of
[23:27] their life and there stood the word
[23:30] before then and yet they crucified for
[23:40] what deed did they crucify for what
[23:44] wrong did they crucify the only wrong
[23:50] you can come up with is the fact that he
[23:52] didn't come according to their thinking
[24:00] but what about you and I
[24:06] what about you Quran well brother Li I
[24:10] believe I believe and I come into
[24:13] message and I believe it and I've been
[24:15] in the message 20 30 40 50 years
[24:18] whatever you know but why is it that
[24:26] everybody is not sealed into the kingdom
[24:30] of God that makes a confession with
[24:32] their mouth and claim to believe in
[24:33] their heart that's all my point my whole
[24:38] point is to remain you to think about it
[24:40] is it possible that we could be in the
[24:44] same shape they were in oh come on I'll
[24:50] come down through it I've been all
[24:52] through the years of the denominational
[24:55] times and through this message and heard
[24:57] people's philosophies and the things
[24:59] well all you got to do is believe it all
[25:04] you got to do is accept Jesus Christ as
[25:06] your Savior that's all you can do
[25:09] then confess with your mouth well now
[25:16] let's take that little talk confess with
[25:20] your mouth
[25:23] what do you confess him to be what do
[25:31] you mean he's my Savior
[25:36] he's my god we don't mean the king all
[25:42] of those things
[25:44] Israel was looking forward to and are
[25:47] still today looking forward to that so
[25:56] what do you think about it
[26:01] we went through the scripture is showing
[26:04] that Jesus spoke of him being the chief
[26:08] Cornerstone the very father scriptures
[26:11] from Psalms to her that he would be that
[26:14] that the builders would refuse him but
[26:19] he would become the headstone of the
[26:21] corner now that's in songs he would
[26:24] become the headstone the of the corner
[26:29] now there's a difference between the
[26:32] corner stone and the headstone because
[26:35] of the position that it is within but
[26:39] yet the headstone has to be more than
[26:42] the corner stone we'll get to that he
[26:49] said they did not listen to my point did
[26:53] they reject him as the cornerstone so
[27:00] thereby they rejected him as the Messiah
[27:02] they rejected him as their God the ruler
[27:07] their king any definition you want to
[27:10] place opponent they rejected that
[27:14] because they didn't want him to rule
[27:16] over them good by rejecting him he
[27:28] became the chief cornerstone of what not
[27:36] of Israel they rejected it he was the
[27:43] head stone to the Israel according to
[27:47] the scripture but if they could not
[27:52] receive the cornerstone why would you
[27:55] discuss the head stump
[27:57] are you with me you catch them appoint
[28:03] if they couldn't see the who the
[28:05] cornerstone is or was whatever which way
[28:08] you want to use terminologies how could
[28:13] you even talked about the headstone
[28:19] would have any reason for discussing the
[28:22] coming of the headstone if they rejected
[28:26] him as the cornerstone now remember the
[28:30] terminologies the scripture says that
[28:32] that one you rejected has become the
[28:36] head of the corner never think the
[28:40] church ain't never had a head he's
[28:43] always had to hate it he's RA it we get
[28:46] to probably it would turn around incite
[28:48] the headstone not coming yet
[29:01] he didn't he's the foundation stone
[29:05] Isaiah we read that I tried stone a
[29:09] precious cornerstone but sure foundation
[29:15] do all that believe upon him why would
[29:22] they turn him down now not the Romans
[29:28] turning him down in killing him no the
[29:34] church that was looking for that stone
[29:37] to come looking for that Messiah looking
[29:43] for that ruler that King the God that
[29:46] the word had spoke up and yet they
[29:50] rejected him don't you think that they
[29:55] could believe in their heart as I said
[29:57] there a moment ago the Bible talks is
[29:59] ending is coming down to there Jesus is
[30:01] telling and the Bible says and many of
[30:04] them believed were they saved no because
[30:17] he turned right around to the same
[30:18] people that's claiming to believe him
[30:21] and said you rejected the cornerstone
[30:28] you rejected me as your Savior you
[30:34] rejected me as your king or ruler could
[30:41] we do that as I said over and over Jesus
[30:49] Christ came exactly according to the
[30:54] Word of God you agree with that right to
[30:57] the letter according to the word when
[31:03] you read that a virgin would be born
[31:06] that's the letter of the word that
[31:08] happened when you read that he would be
[31:11] the branch out of David that's the word
[31:15] when you read that he would be God and
[31:18] Lord yet you know yourself we gave you
[31:23] the scripture where Jesus was standing
[31:26] there talking to him and he said you
[31:29] rejected the cornerstone and we said
[31:36] then it left you and went to another
[31:38] people it's gone to the Gentiles because
[31:46] they will believe what about see they
[31:53] rejected him as the head because he
[32:00] would have been the head of Israel now
[32:04] listen to my point what we get through
[32:05] them will divide this letter they
[32:08] rejected him as the Messiah they
[32:12] rejected him as the chief Cornerstone
[32:15] and he become a stumbling stone to them
[32:21] they believed not and listened web
[32:25] saying in the right way but they were
[32:28] believers right could it be that we'd be
[32:34] believers and reject no brother death I
[32:37] accepted Jesus Christ as my savior amen
[32:45] did he accept you then you get into
[32:52] terminologies and thoughts we will get
[32:55] back to the scripture about it how can
[32:57] you call on one if you don't know me
[33:01] when I brother they are you making it
[33:04] too technical because see when I
[33:06] accepted Jesus Christ I accepted him as
[33:09] my personal Savior
[33:16] well one is you out of trouble when
[33:18] somebody tried to explain one God to you
[33:23] if you accepted him as your personal
[33:26] Savior and you would accept him as Jesus
[33:28] Christ
[33:29] why did you thank him to be the third
[33:32] person of the Trinity or the second
[33:33] person or the first person well it was
[33:37] because you're thinking Lily right
[33:41] because I didn't know I'm not
[33:47] responsible I didn't know but why would
[33:56] you reject it when it would come to you
[34:03] you said we don't want women now so you
[34:09] can know the whole story and not be able
[34:14] to understand what the word is talking
[34:17] about as I said after all that we know
[34:24] about the Bible and it becomes the head
[34:26] of the corner but when the prophet of
[34:31] God would come for speaking of the
[34:33] headstone he says then come yet so
[34:41] that's why our dependence has to be up
[34:45] on the basis of whether this prophet in
[34:47] the end time was a prophet or not
[34:52] because he would be the only one that
[34:54] would have the correct understanding now
[35:00] come on I know what the Bible says but I
[35:04] know what it goes on to say we say well
[35:07] the Bible said that God winked at our
[35:09] ignorance that's true when we didn't
[35:13] understand he winked at her ignorance
[35:14] but then watch the rest of that
[35:16] scripture it says but we don't have no
[35:20] excuse now the truth has come you know
[35:25] how it exclusive an excuse of ignorance
[35:27] the truth is come who do you serve have
[35:37] you accepted him as the Messiah as the
[35:43] ruler as your Lord but now we're asking
[35:51] the question back as he accepted you now
[35:55] what would be wrong if he didn't accept
[35:57] us when we accept him we accept him what
[36:06] would be the problem maybe it's the way
[36:12] we accept him
[36:14] maybe it's us accepting him as being
[36:17] something that he's not the albert's
[36:22] you're imagining me responsible we're
[36:25] responsible to hear the word when the
[36:26] word is brought agree you see he never
[36:35] did come to Israel the way they were
[36:41] thinking he was to come I said the way
[36:45] they were thinking him to come so
[36:49] thereby they turned him down could we do
[36:54] that could we could he come to us and
[37:01] try to come to us and in us rejecting
[37:03] because of our preconceived ideas they
[37:10] come on we got it in the scripture right
[37:12] how can you call on him unless you know
[37:16] who you're calling on is that fire
[37:18] phrase in the scripture I hope you were
[37:23] that nothing else is brought out of this
[37:24] message today you'll get one point you
[37:30] can call him Jesus Jesus the Prophet
[37:34] said and still worshipping Satan
[37:38] and what about that it's what you don't
[37:44] understand brother Dale I accepted Jesus
[37:47] I know when Jesus came into my life well
[37:54] why did you reject the word when it was
[37:56] first told you then I did not confess
[38:04] and never have confessed that I had the
[38:06] Holy Ghost when I was back in her with
[38:09] the nominations coming out of there and
[38:12] coming into the message
[38:13] I never confessed that I came into the
[38:16] message proving I had to all ago I came
[38:18] into the message seeking after the Holy
[38:20] Ghost not trying to prop up something
[38:25] that I had done and I had seen many
[38:27] things and many things that happened in
[38:29] my life
[38:30] they were supernatural but yet when I
[38:36] saw or heard a prophet explaining
[38:39] Newburg I knew I didn't have it did it
[38:47] make you that way or did it make you
[38:49] great say well I believe the message and
[38:51] the reason I know I got to hold ago I
[38:53] believe the message winders the people
[39:02] of this message reject the message then
[39:07] see we're ready we'll get back to later
[39:12] in the message on down the road in
[39:16] Zachariah and for and I wish you would
[39:20] read that over and over and Zachariah
[39:22] and there's a little message called
[39:25] message of grace they better run a
[39:28] preach that you'd listen to it would
[39:30] help we're not going to talk about the
[39:33] headstone because they didn't receive
[39:39] the cornerstone was no need to talking
[39:43] about the headstone are you with me
[39:48] there's no need of all of your great
[39:50] understanding of the headstone if you
[39:55] don't know what the cornerstone is right
[40:00] is that simple
[40:03] now let's talk about the headstone
[40:06] remember I kind of said a lot of people
[40:09] years ago and the doctrine was they're
[40:12] coming around about the son of man and I
[40:16] asked you as the church you know about
[40:21] the son of God and it was not understood
[40:26] about the son of God but everybody
[40:28] understood about the son of man that's a
[40:30] simple question I said how can that be
[40:33] how can it be that you can understand
[40:35] all about son of man and you know
[40:37] nothing about son of God and that's the
[40:42] simple question where did the son of
[40:44] going to have the beginning called
[40:45] either son and had a beginning I'm
[40:54] asking you a simple question today how
[40:56] do you know you're saved my plate inant
[41:07] and I ask the second part of the
[41:10] question why is it that everybody says
[41:12] they believe you don't find it with it
[41:14] being right and believing it well God
[41:23] knows my heart that's the problem if he
[41:28] didn't know our heart we'd be in good
[41:30] shape right but now listen could it be
[41:40] because like I said no need talking
[41:43] about a headstone and we got this great
[41:46] nation to the headstone and all we got
[41:48] this way there's no need talking about
[41:50] that until you realize who the
[41:51] cornerstone is now remember the
[41:57] cornerstone becomes a headstone right
[42:02] but remember now according to the Bible
[42:05] the cornerstone that they rejected was
[42:11] the headstone and he became the
[42:14] headstone of the church yet the Prophet
[42:18] said the headstone had never come yet
[42:26] could it be that we would reject the
[42:28] stone and could it be that they rejected
[42:34] that stone the cornerstone because they
[42:41] didn't know who he was that was the
[42:45] point last Sunday they didn't know who
[42:49] he was
[42:50] had they known who he was would they're
[42:53] rejected him
[42:54] come on the Bible says it Bible plainly
[42:58] tells you had they known it they
[43:00] wouldn't crucified if they had known who
[43:04] that stone was they would have never in
[43:06] no way with one hand upon crucifying but
[43:11] they didn't believe him yet they were
[43:16] believers in God but I like brother
[43:23] Brennan's way of describing in things
[43:25] what he said now sadar was even the
[43:28] garden to death she didn't come up so I
[43:34] don't believe in God because she
[43:40] believed that but she put her own
[43:42] interpretation upon what God had said
[43:47] could we do that now we'll get back to
[43:55] the headstone later and bringing it in
[43:57] the thought well let's get this corner
[43:59] stone and get it as the Bible calls it a
[44:04] stone of stumbling and a rock of offense
[44:07] as to what as to them that stumble what
[44:12] at
[44:14] the word there's no way for us to know
[44:22] about God except by his word would you
[44:26] agree is that sensible the only way to
[44:30] good and it took him six thousand years
[44:34] to bring forth that word for us to build
[44:41] understanding to see by rejecting Jesus
[44:49] Christ as their Savior the Messiah they
[44:58] rejected the right of sonship they
[45:09] rejected the new birth they rejected the
[45:16] kingdom that we read that Jesus had to
[45:19] be taken from you kneeling to another
[45:22] you realize what they rejected their
[45:26] they rejected their very God that they
[45:29] believed in now why did they reject him
[45:35] in what happened
[45:38] see they believed they were the children
[45:41] of God right come on Israel believed
[45:47] they were the chosen they tell you that
[45:51] in hurry oh they were so great about it
[45:54] I remember that remember the one and
[45:56] they were talking to Jesus that day and
[45:58] he said something to him and they said
[46:00] we were never under bondage to no one
[46:04] then right then the Romans was ruling
[46:07] the Jews and killing them right is it
[46:13] true right then they were being killed
[46:16] by the Romans for any little thing go
[46:18] which is we were never under bondage to
[46:21] no one
[46:25] what do you think Jesus said when he
[46:27] looked at
[46:28] they said we will never under bondage
[46:31] nobody and he looks at him he says who
[46:34] do you pay your taxes to who you do the
[46:36] thing right see because they were
[46:42] rejecting the fact that somebody else
[46:46] was ruling over them it's kind of silly
[46:55] you're in jail but I'm not in jail
[46:58] behind bars I'm not my lord I'm free so
[47:05] you know they had enough understanding
[47:07] to realize that it was not the fact of
[47:11] what government was ruling them right
[47:16] they were not considering who was ruling
[47:18] them then broke they would not even let
[47:21] that come into being they were
[47:24] considering that they were the people of
[47:26] God right they were considering the fact
[47:32] that they were the children of God they
[47:39] were saying that God was their father
[47:45] and they knew nothing about the
[47:49] scriptural terminologies was the Messiah
[47:52] they would come to die for their sins
[47:55] they were only looking for a ruling
[47:57] Messiah that's why they rejected it when
[48:01] it came as a birth as a child they
[48:04] couldn't handle it at all even though
[48:07] the Bible as I said while ago spoke of
[48:09] it emphatically they would not accept
[48:14] him they rejected him as being their God
[48:25] the ruler
[48:32] they rejected sunshield Church do you
[48:40] realize that the Gentile dispensations
[48:48] the basics of agenda this sensation that
[48:51] claims to be God as their Savior as
[48:55] their healer has are all and all as
[48:57] their king has rejected that and
[49:03] crucified him again do we need to go
[49:06] into the message do we need to preach
[49:09] awhile on what for words for profit use
[49:12] dire they crucified him dire the
[49:19] greatest religious leaders they the
[49:22] greatest of all and really the great
[49:24] they're chosen crucified the most
[49:26] horrible death him the god of glory the
[49:31] Bible says we do that and put him to an
[49:33] open shame am I putting scriptures
[49:37] together would you see what I'm getting
[49:42] at they rejected the right of sonship it
[49:51] was never meant never would have been
[49:54] there's no way it could have taken place
[49:56] that God could have rode right into
[49:58] Jerusalem and they accepted him is all
[50:01] of these things and he was their king he
[50:03] was their ruler he was everything come
[50:06] on we're human being that would have
[50:08] never happened because that was not
[50:10] God's Way God's Way was to become as a
[50:15] child to live with mankind and to prove
[50:24] as they would even say we know this man
[50:29] has got to be of God because nobody can
[50:32] do the things that he does but why would
[50:35] you turn that down
[50:42] well what was that they do is phrase it
[50:44] you mean right now
[50:46] are you afraid if they come in here with
[50:48] a gun and said we're gonna kill
[50:49] everybody that confesses they're
[50:51] Christians any of those is gonna get up
[50:54] walk out and say I'm not a Christian oh
[50:56] I would do no you just walk out the door
[51:02] that's exactly what they were cover what
[51:08] are you following the talk to reject the
[51:11] right of sonship is exactly what Israel
[51:16] lost when God turned to the Gentiles to
[51:23] bring out a people for his name and
[51:29] Israel rejected it the kingdom truly
[51:33] then Jesus said was taken from them and
[51:36] given to another there were not even the
[51:42] people of God that's why we read then
[51:45] Paul talking about it by not accepting
[51:52] him as the Messiah they automatically
[52:00] turned down the birth rock because
[52:06] that's what the Messiah meant
[52:11] xavier by turning down the messiah not
[52:18] accepting him at being your savior you
[52:21] automatically turn down your rights of
[52:23] anything else but not knowing by not
[52:33] knowing is the reason Israel rejected
[52:38] him the way of truth was taken from them
[52:46] are you with me
[52:48] you shook head and grinned a little bit
[52:50] want to go any way that he did come
[52:52] according to way the word said right I
[52:56] mean he did Jesus did come exactly the
[52:59] way the Bible said he would come
[53:01] well after everybody studying that why
[53:03] couldn't somebody come up with the right
[53:05] understanding are you anything the best
[53:11] could could be brought out of it come on
[53:14] don't take me wrong with the best it
[53:17] could be brought out of all the
[53:19] understanding of the Old Testament was a
[53:24] handful of fishermen no learned scholars
[53:32] accepted Jesus Christ Paul is the
[53:36] greatest of all coming over right the
[53:44] great Nicodemus I know you're a mention
[53:47] from God he didn't accept it the great
[53:53] Camejo that knew the great ones one of
[53:58] those - you know said we better leave
[53:59] this alone because that if we don't it
[54:02] will be happily fighting against God and
[54:04] said if it's not of God it'll go away
[54:07] anyway
[54:07] because we doesn't have many of them
[54:09] before word that doesn't have many
[54:11] messiahs they try to take over and rule
[54:17] the government
[54:23] but could it be by not knowing is the
[54:30] reason they rejected a witch survival
[54:36] says the way of truth had been
[54:39] misinterpreted to them why didn't the
[54:45] ones who knew the truth say well it we
[54:52] need to believe this I said be great
[54:55] come at you and then great Nicodemus
[54:58] come on get the story what I'm talking
[55:01] about
[55:01] wording any other religious leaders at
[55:07] that time now come on
[55:11] are you with me where did any of them
[55:14] accept Jesus Christ when we get personal
[55:22] now for me but Nicodemus believed in his
[55:33] heart and confess with his mouth that he
[55:38] had to be something why was he not saved
[55:43] we know the story
[55:45] come on why I said we're glad we got a
[55:48] message we know the story but what if
[55:52] you had never heard understanding what
[55:55] would be your answer to Nicodemus and
[55:57] gamaya
[55:58] the great men that made a public
[56:01] confession Nicodemus went to Jesus
[56:06] confessing him to be something we know
[56:09] you're a teacher come from God you think
[56:14] he didn't believe in his heart
[56:17] it was shouldn't death to him if they'd
[56:21] have found him upfront or at least
[56:24] blackballing him you know and I'm sure
[56:27] they did because of some of the
[56:29] statements he made what are you with me
[56:32] why was Nicodemus not one of those it
[56:34] went to the upper room
[56:41] the best of all you could do was 11 no
[56:49] good come on the Lord forgive me for
[56:54] taking the wording to say it but it's
[56:56] true right
[56:57] tax collectors everybody hates them
[57:01] don't they all of these things of life
[57:04] and yesterday's brother told a joke with
[57:06] Arnaz noticed make a point not as a joke
[57:08] but said he walked out in the cemetery
[57:11] and he looked and said there on the sign
[57:12] said a politician and an honest man the
[57:20] guy looked at and said we know for sure
[57:21] there's two people buried in that grave
[57:29] come on right
[57:33] tax collectors fishermen couldn't even
[57:40] sign their own name you know I think
[57:45] about that a lot just you know you know
[57:50] the earth like this way he's like I
[57:52] think plenty unknowing to do you know
[57:54] that Peter wrote the scripture first the
[58:00] second theater he couldn't write his
[58:03] name so evidently somebody else much too
[58:07] wrote what he said right so we get the
[58:10] story right somebody else mr. Roy
[58:12] because he couldn't even write his name
[58:14] right but listen the best you could get
[58:19] out of it was a bunch of scoundrels a
[58:24] bunch of guys like Peter that would lie
[58:28] to try to save his own throat a Judas
[58:35] they would sell out for money we took
[58:41] one of them out of the group so you wind
[58:45] up with eleven and they try to
[58:49] in a matthäus everybody pronounce his
[58:51] name
[58:52] nothing's ever said about him we know
[58:56] that wasn't right to be was supposed to
[58:58] waited to Apostle Paul came along right
[59:00] good listen the point is why not one
[59:06] religious leader accepted Jesus Christ
[59:15] now come on your prophet said it you can
[59:17] say well Nicodemus minor your prophet
[59:19] said it now you arguing him he said
[59:22] Nicodemus and gamaya
[59:23] would be given eternal life for their
[59:25] stand for the gospel so that you know
[59:28] what that means they didn't have eternal
[59:31] life
[59:31] they didn't accept Jesus Christ as their
[59:34] Savior out of all the believing they had
[59:38] it was not a bit of it brought salvation
[59:41] to those two they meant something the
[59:47] Bible said he came to his own his own
[59:50] received him not then it stops right and
[59:53] he was he finished we said as many as
[59:56] received him gave he power to become the
[59:58] sons of God Israel rejected sonship
[1:00:04] right that's where their trouble is
[1:00:07] today when they rejected sonship they
[1:00:09] will never come back as a nation at
[1:00:11] sonship they will come back as 144,000
[1:00:16] servants to the bride I don't care what
[1:00:20] you give them eternal life or what you
[1:00:22] want to do they will never be sons and
[1:00:25] daughters of a living God because they
[1:00:28] rejected that are you following me till
[1:00:38] they stumbled at the stumbling stone as
[1:00:43] we were talking about its first Peter 2
[1:00:49] and 6 through 8 no they stumbled at the
[1:00:54] stumbling stone then why would it be
[1:00:58] called a stumbling stone
[1:01:02] and a rock of avenged
[1:01:11] he's not making him wrong he's got to be
[1:01:14] making what they were believing wrong
[1:01:18] they're believing was the problem okay
[1:01:20] let's go a little bit they stumbled at
[1:01:23] that stumbling-stone and he came to his
[1:01:27] own John won his own received him not
[1:01:32] but to a few of them he became the
[1:01:38] fulfillment of Psalms 118 he becomes the
[1:01:44] headstone of the corner right to just a
[1:01:50] handful he became to fulfill Matthew 21
[1:02:01] the head of the corner a sure foundation
[1:02:07] a chief Cornerstone Isaiah spoke of in
[1:02:16] 26 of 16 City was a sure foundation and
[1:02:23] words that foundation laid and how does
[1:02:29] it connect to you and I go ahead and
[1:02:31] number six Ephesians 2 that we read and
[1:02:38] we're built our homes are no more
[1:02:41] strangers and foreigners but
[1:02:43] fellow-citizens
[1:02:45] a half a dozen the people come on you
[1:02:53] want the story from brother branham the
[1:02:55] church in ephesus who everybody dozen or
[1:02:57] something the best jesus jesus could do
[1:03:02] out of all of his three and five years
[1:03:04] of ministry coming according to the word
[1:03:06] and doing exactly the way the word come
[1:03:08] he winds up with eleven
[1:03:18] my rock the other two sweetly I think
[1:03:23] was three thousand later because those
[1:03:25] eleven will use right that's true look
[1:03:28] and are built upon what now Isaiah says
[1:03:34] then he that he's the sure foundation
[1:03:38] now look at your foundation what found a
[1:03:40] feet on me and I built upon the
[1:03:42] foundation of the apostles and prophets
[1:03:44] Jesus Christ Himself being the chief
[1:03:47] Cornerstone now let me ask you this way
[1:03:50] how do you read that scripture oh I
[1:03:53] really built upon the foundation
[1:03:55] apostles and prophets plain language
[1:04:04] what's it saying you're builds upon the
[1:04:09] revelation of the apostles and prophets
[1:04:15] right the foundation stone is revelation
[1:04:21] you build on the revelation of who Jesus
[1:04:24] Christ not of the Apostles mmm no it's
[1:04:31] of Jesus Christ in other words whatever
[1:04:35] his disciples teach you got to believe
[1:04:38] it you ever heard this statement made by
[1:04:42] the Prophet if Peter had her said
[1:04:45] standing on your head that would what
[1:04:49] would have been put in there and that
[1:04:51] would have been the way you would have
[1:04:52] come into the kingdom right come on are
[1:04:57] you with me see he knew he had place
[1:05:03] within them three and a half years of
[1:05:08] ministry for them to know who he was and
[1:05:13] they finally get down to the end of it
[1:05:16] other side says now we know now we
[1:05:20] believe that you've got it and you're
[1:05:23] the one he said do you humbly like I
[1:05:27] said but
[1:05:29] and no goods but that was the only one
[1:05:36] who listened to it what are you getting
[1:05:39] it
[1:05:39] they built upon the foundation you're
[1:05:42] built upon what the Apostles teach the
[1:05:47] teaching of the Apostles that's why we
[1:05:49] believe in what's called the faith of
[1:05:50] the father's that's the faith of the
[1:05:52] father's now look at the pyramid and
[1:05:54] we'll get back to it later you say the
[1:05:56] foundation stone it's right down here no
[1:05:59] excuse me this is the foundation stone
[1:06:04] you gonna sell him in the corner because
[1:06:07] you got a story about the stone when I
[1:06:10] would ask you to even give me a
[1:06:11] definition scripturally speaking of the
[1:06:17] stone and what because when he calls it
[1:06:20] the head of the corner when he called
[1:06:21] her the corner stone when he called it a
[1:06:24] chief corner stone are you with me this
[1:06:29] is the face of the father's not just
[1:06:31] faith as a born-again experience this
[1:06:33] entire pyramid is the faith of the
[1:06:36] father's we don't make it one stone at
[1:06:42] the bottom and then move the stone up
[1:06:43] the top you got to make it a revelation
[1:06:48] we're built upon the foundation we're
[1:06:50] built upon what the Apostles taught and
[1:06:58] don't worry about it they're not going
[1:07:00] to teach anything contrary to him why
[1:07:04] because it's him in them doing it all
[1:07:09] right now this is what we were trying to
[1:07:14] get to so let's get on to that point
[1:07:16] what about it why was it that they
[1:07:21] couldn't accept it
[1:07:25] go ahead waiter number seven let's tell
[1:07:31] you whether it's just a little now
[1:07:38] but can I say it this way you that have
[1:07:40] the notes if you look at your life's
[1:07:45] note on the back it is from the message
[1:07:52] is this the sign of the end time sir is
[1:07:56] this the time brother Branham says
[1:08:01] Romans tells you nine that they rejected
[1:08:11] it
[1:08:13] telling the Romans that the Jews tried
[1:08:16] to accept it by works but it's by faith
[1:08:21] that we believe it now I'm not doing
[1:08:27] this to be smart addict I'm just doing
[1:08:29] it to prove a point to show do you know
[1:08:32] what he's explaining right above dial
[1:08:40] it's not in your notes so don't worry
[1:08:42] about it but you know what he's
[1:08:44] explaining right above that and he comes
[1:08:49] out to a statement that the Jews tried
[1:08:53] to accept it by works but it's by faith
[1:09:02] that we believe it you know what vision
[1:09:06] he was explaining right above that and
[1:09:11] why would he conclude it with Romans and
[1:09:14] said the Holy Spirit gave him the
[1:09:16] scripture and he turned back to it he
[1:09:19] turned to it read it he said lord if
[1:09:21] that be you if this is sowing sowing
[1:09:25] throwing throwing I'm going to die said
[1:09:27] don't let me you know let it be that I
[1:09:29] don't tell nobody we said if this is in
[1:09:32] other words the fundamental perforation
[1:09:34] of my ministry let the spirit come back
[1:09:37] he says likely took him out of the
[1:09:38] building and then he concludes it by
[1:09:43] saying
[1:09:47] it concludes it by saying that the Jews
[1:09:55] rejected it could we reject what he said
[1:10:01] right above there so that makes you
[1:10:04] interesting to go home look look you
[1:10:07] know what he was explaining right above
[1:10:09] there he was explaining the vision of
[1:10:14] the seven angels that come to him in
[1:10:18] Arizona so what are you doing I'm trying
[1:10:26] to show you it's got to be by faith a
[1:10:28] revelation not by your ideas my idea
[1:10:30] he's explaining the vision of the little
[1:10:35] birds in the bigger birds and then the
[1:10:37] angels coming to him and he concludes it
[1:10:40] by saying that the Holy Spirit led him
[1:10:43] back to that scripture and if that busy
[1:10:45] let me read it he turn right to it and
[1:10:46] read it
[1:10:47] he said they sought it not by faith we
[1:10:54] got it all figured out we know what this
[1:10:56] is we know what that is and that was
[1:10:58] what he was explained so let's read the
[1:11:01] scripture he's talking from Romans and
[1:11:04] saying about how the Gentiles followed
[1:11:06] not after righteousness remember last
[1:11:08] Sunday we were on that but they've
[1:11:11] attained to righteousness even to the
[1:11:14] righteousness which is of faith but
[1:11:18] Israel which followed after the law of
[1:11:21] righteousness in other words they kept
[1:11:23] the law to the letter remember last
[1:11:25] Sunday trying to express it they'd done
[1:11:27] it to the letter they there was no way
[1:11:29] that Jesus told the conference or any of
[1:11:33] them you know you a bunch of dirty dogs
[1:11:34] he done this or so-and-so he never
[1:11:36] called out anything because it didn't
[1:11:38] have anything to be called out he never
[1:11:43] condemned them for what they were doing
[1:11:44] that way he condemned them because they
[1:11:46] didn't believe who he was right
[1:11:52] their lives were right they were
[1:11:54] following it by the work for the law the
[1:11:57] law said don't knew they didn't know
[1:11:59] well knew they did do but Israel
[1:12:05] which followed after the law
[1:12:07] Reisen have not attained to the law of
[1:12:09] righteousness why wherefore because they
[1:12:13] sought it not by faith but as it were by
[1:12:17] the works of the law something that
[1:12:22] could do or not do for they stumbled at
[1:12:27] the stumbling stone they stumbled by
[1:12:39] trying to do what they're supposed to do
[1:12:42] but just remember one thing we also know
[1:12:44] the story it was never God's right or
[1:12:48] will to have given the law the law was
[1:12:52] added the Bible said because of man's
[1:12:54] transgression the law was not original
[1:12:58] to be given they wanted the law am i
[1:13:05] right is it Exodus 19 the greatest
[1:13:08] mistake Israel ever made am i right am i
[1:13:10] quoting a prophet the greatest mistake
[1:13:12] they ever made we're saying give us
[1:13:15] something to do give us a law we'll keep
[1:13:20] it knowing they could not do it because
[1:13:24] like I said like Sunday I wish that
[1:13:26] would bound into our hearts and life
[1:13:28] there is nobody can keep the law no
[1:13:31] person no human can keep the law it
[1:13:35] takes a born-again believer to keep the
[1:13:38] law one without the born-again
[1:13:44] experience can't keep the law you see
[1:13:46] what I didn't do this I didn't do that
[1:13:47] does that make you saved ours where you
[1:13:51] troubled that what you were before they
[1:13:54] sought it not by faith but as it were by
[1:13:56] the works of the law for they stumbled
[1:13:57] at that stumbling-stone so that
[1:13:59] stumbling stone was not a bunch of works
[1:14:02] it was faith
[1:14:04] I thought we were building the
[1:14:09] foundation of the apostles and prophets
[1:14:15] the revelation of the Apostles and
[1:14:17] probably you were agreeing with me there
[1:14:19] for a minute ago but now you're kind of
[1:14:20] slow back because you don't know which
[1:14:22] way I'm headed right that's a good idea
[1:14:24] but listen you stumble at the stumbling
[1:14:32] stone they did they would not listen to
[1:14:37] those apostles even after the death the
[1:14:41] resurrection and the things they would
[1:14:44] not listen to what those disciples said
[1:14:48] about the foundations tongue right do we
[1:14:59] listen to what the foundation stone says
[1:15:03] if everything we've got built on the
[1:15:05] foundation upon the problem oh no
[1:15:07] brother Dale they were there right down
[1:15:09] here this is foundational I know that
[1:15:11] whole thing according to Peter the
[1:15:17] statue of perfect man is the faith of
[1:15:19] the fathers that's the cornerstone is
[1:15:25] that whole pyramid right here with the
[1:15:30] headstone ain't come yet
[1:15:35] now listen for they stumbled at the
[1:15:40] revelation of Jesus Christ is that
[1:15:44] putting it down in the language they
[1:15:45] stumbled at the stumbling stone and
[1:15:47] stone is not a rock laying out somewhere
[1:15:49] it's revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:15:51] could we stumble at that because we
[1:15:53] don't know what it is you see I know you
[1:15:57] don't like my terminology and I know
[1:15:59] people out there don't but that comes
[1:16:01] down into my heart and I just cry to
[1:16:04] sleep the preachers of this message is
[1:16:08] the ones that had blinded the eyes of
[1:16:10] the people to the word that the Prophet
[1:16:13] wrote if not that the same thing
[1:16:18] I say done they said Jesus took that you
[1:16:21] stand in the door and won't go in and
[1:16:24] won't let them go in is that scripture
[1:16:31] the brother we don't need to do these
[1:16:34] deep lines on the prophet preach it why
[1:16:40] is it in the Bible well we just tire
[1:16:46] that out told you about a brother one
[1:16:50] time you know he was really being great
[1:16:52] and smart you know he said that the
[1:16:54] first Corinthians I say at 13 was a gift
[1:16:57] some time he said that'll be a tour out
[1:16:59] of the Bible I'm sorry I'm just human I
[1:17:08] said give me your Bible but then what
[1:17:13] you're gonna do
[1:17:14] terr it out he knew better to give me
[1:17:18] that Bible because he knew exactly I'd
[1:17:20] about him 10 brand new Bibles it make no
[1:17:23] difference about that but it even handed
[1:17:25] me that Bible he was warning said it not
[1:17:28] me not me tutor it out to me it's the
[1:17:32] Word of God that's the staff the Lord as
[1:17:38] well in John 3:16
[1:17:39] I said give me a bottle he wouldn't dare
[1:17:45] let me edit I'm sorry I've always been
[1:17:49] that way because I believe it what the
[1:17:51] word is saying what they stumbled not to
[1:17:57] disciples the disciples didn't stumble
[1:18:01] they walked by faith right into the
[1:18:07] revealed word they were the ones that
[1:18:10] was being rejected if you're listening
[1:18:12] to me when he came on over to the time
[1:18:15] the disciples was the foundation
[1:18:18] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being
[1:18:21] Durov elation to be talk to the people
[1:18:24] who are they turning down Jesus Christ
[1:18:26] right we know that who were they turning
[1:18:29] down the apostles
[1:18:33] not because they were the ones with the
[1:18:37] revelation come on listen now actually
[1:18:39] said but they stumbled at the stumbling
[1:18:42] stone they stumble into revelation of
[1:18:44] the simplicity of Jesus Christ as it is
[1:18:48] written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling
[1:18:53] stone and rock of offense whosoever
[1:18:58] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[1:19:03] why because it's the cornerstone it's
[1:19:08] the cornerstone but what it is where do
[1:19:12] they stumble at go on to number eight
[1:19:19] let's get a couple more little quick
[1:19:22] first Peter to in a sentence under your
[1:19:25] die for which believe he's precious but
[1:19:28] it is then which be disobedient the
[1:19:31] stone which the builders disallowed the
[1:19:34] same is made the head of the corner you
[1:19:37] know that life Sunday he's the head of
[1:19:39] even the center even the center he's a
[1:19:44] head so don't think about that I would
[1:19:46] say in any way that your church ain't
[1:19:47] never had a head the church is always
[1:19:49] had a head Paul spoke of it as Christ in
[1:19:55] the church Paul spoke of the headstone
[1:19:57] but it was not the headstone like the
[1:20:01] finality it was where the cornerstone
[1:20:05] had become the head it always been a
[1:20:10] head even to the sinner but look this is
[1:20:12] what I like about it and a stone of
[1:20:16] stumbling and a rock of offense to who
[1:20:21] even to them which stumble at the word
[1:20:26] stumble at the face of the father's yet
[1:20:30] everybody knows all about it all he goes
[1:20:32] I know nothing about the face of the
[1:20:34] father's may not tell you a little bit
[1:20:41] about it how are we living there are a
[1:20:43] lot of people in this nation
[1:20:44] I believe brother branham of a 262
[1:20:47] didn't know what he's talking about
[1:20:48] when he finally got straightened out in
[1:20:50] 63 you know you tell me where the faith
[1:20:54] of the father's day because according to
[1:20:57] my understanding the messenger of
[1:21:00] Malachi 4 is supposed to do two things 1
[1:21:03] turn hearts of children back to faith
[1:21:05] fathers to bring the thunders I thought
[1:21:08] it was to be done both ways
[1:21:10] but listen then that stumble at the word
[1:21:14] being disobedient weren't to they were
[1:21:17] appointed naturally as rotor story
[1:21:21] naturally Israel the laws adoption
[1:21:25] everything pertaining to Israel because
[1:21:27] they were the chosen they were appointed
[1:21:29] to sonship but they rejected it by
[1:21:33] rejecting sonship they rejected
[1:21:34] everything could it be if we don't
[1:21:41] understand sonship that we could reject
[1:21:47] sit and talk with two brothers one time
[1:21:50] and one of them said when I got born
[1:21:52] again I got everything he's telling
[1:21:56] about the pyramid they place the other
[1:22:01] one said ain't got nothing yet
[1:22:05] I said well brothers y'all mind if I
[1:22:12] just stay between you because somewhere
[1:22:15] between heart he's got to be a truth if
[1:22:19] you think you got everything when you
[1:22:21] got the new bird I don't agree with that
[1:22:24] but don't agree with the other brother
[1:22:26] saying ain't got nothing yet I said
[1:22:31] somewhere in the training high laser
[1:22:32] truth would you think they took the
[1:22:36] truth but listen but as to them which
[1:22:41] stumbled at the word
[1:22:49] I had an opportunity in early ministry
[1:22:53] to visit some of these other countries
[1:22:56] and I went out crying in my heart
[1:22:59] because I saw people and I knew of
[1:23:06] people here in America that was sending
[1:23:08] their great missionaries over there to
[1:23:13] those countries and I knew they were
[1:23:16] putting big money in behind it
[1:23:18] buying things and doing things for to
[1:23:23] get them to believe what they said
[1:23:25] because they didn't have no way to argue
[1:23:30] they didn't have the next speech they
[1:23:35] had people coming over and saying this
[1:23:39] is what the Prophet says right here this
[1:23:43] wasn't part of it
[1:23:44] I cried I said my heart to think about
[1:23:49] I'll do the best I can to try to help
[1:23:52] these people to be able to get right
[1:23:54] around his message and the best that I
[1:23:57] can do of it because that was my desire
[1:24:04] where would you be today if you had no
[1:24:07] message and a preacher get up the
[1:24:09] pulpits and brother Brown said join Joe
[1:24:10] right around said so and rum we didn't
[1:24:14] say it the mercy of the elements you
[1:24:20] think that ain't that's bad out there in
[1:24:23] the world what about the mercy of the
[1:24:24] elements of this message people and the
[1:24:28] one thing that hurt me more than
[1:24:29] anything
[1:24:31] if one brother said it all Colin Haynes
[1:24:35] he called but he said you think about
[1:24:41] those people settled are listening and
[1:24:43] said where we quote Paul and Peter and
[1:24:48] James and John as being the Word of God
[1:24:52] coming forward the Apostles said they're
[1:24:54] quoting brother so-and-so brother
[1:24:57] so-and-so brother Shan Hsiung I cried
[1:25:03] because I knew the name they called and
[1:25:05] none of them was on the truth but yet
[1:25:11] they were quoting I'm just like quoting
[1:25:12] the Bible brother so-and-so said it not
[1:25:21] being mixed with faith in them that
[1:25:23] heard it could we stumble at the
[1:25:27] stumbling stone I don't mean to be smart
[1:25:32] aleck I mean to be truthful I've tried
[1:25:35] my best to get you away from the church
[1:25:39] away from doctrines an idea preached
[1:25:43] things to you to try to get you to see
[1:25:44] where people were wrong the biggest
[1:25:48] portion of you just think I'm being
[1:25:49] arrogant and hateful and trying to make
[1:25:52] a point of my own I still don't want to
[1:26:00] stumble after stumbling scum but I ask
[1:26:06] you the last thing you say I've accepted
[1:26:12] Jesus Christ as my savior we got in your
[1:26:18] scripture how you going to know unless
[1:26:19] you somebody tells you who can how can
[1:26:23] you call on him if you don't know we're
[1:26:28] out of time we'll get back to it I do
[1:26:30] want to bring out one little thing go to
[1:26:32] verse go to number nine which is God's
[1:26:34] provided way let's let brother Branham
[1:26:39] explain this about accepting because I
[1:26:44] asked a simple question you've accepted
[1:26:46] Jesus Christ as your Savior
[1:26:48] and you say you're saved but has he
[1:26:51] accepted you come on sisters after you
[1:26:59] accepted Jesus Christ you kept on
[1:27:02] cutting your iron paint your face
[1:27:10] don't look like you accepted you brother
[1:27:18] Dale and then just by accepting it won't
[1:27:24] only do and you read his wordings that's
[1:27:28] what he said
[1:27:29] in other words he saying this accepting
[1:27:32] it you think that that don't work right
[1:27:35] won't only do if that's not enough to
[1:27:38] just accept God's got to vindicate back
[1:27:42] that he has accepted you that's the
[1:27:46] thing you can accept him but then if he
[1:27:49] accepts you stay right there until he
[1:27:53] does accept you and when he does he
[1:27:58] seals you into the kingdom by the
[1:28:00] baptism of the Holy Spirit then you have
[1:28:02] your secure until the day of your
[1:28:04] attention remember Paul and you receive
[1:28:08] the Holy Ghost since you believe there's
[1:28:14] the next one then we'll quit come on
[1:28:15] musicians George out in 1961 don't look
[1:28:21] at yourself look at your lamb God don't
[1:28:26] accept you he accepted the lamb
[1:28:39] he said were you telling me that I need
[1:28:41] to find out if I'm accepted of God now
[1:28:45] I'm trying to tell you how that can be
[1:28:46] done you just remember it's not you it's
[1:28:54] the lamb it's the lamb the one he's
[1:28:59] accepting right chosen in him is this
[1:29:08] the scripture when before the foundation
[1:29:11] of the world when did he choose you when
[1:29:16] he chose the lamb so what I thought you
[1:29:22] were going to give me some kind of a
[1:29:23] something that I'd be looking forward to
[1:29:25] finding something that's what else
[1:29:27] praise God
[1:29:28] keep searching they'll never stop
[1:29:30] searching for God don't ever stop
[1:29:34] searching for God to reveal itself to
[1:29:36] you we just remember the lamb is the
[1:29:47] cornerstone the cornerstone it's the
[1:29:53] foundation stone the foundation stone is
[1:29:59] the revelation of Jesus Christ I'm not
[1:30:06] worried about him accepting me that it'd
[1:30:10] be wrong but will he accept what I've
[1:30:14] said about him will you accept what I've
[1:30:22] said about him then we can take signs
[1:30:29] and wonders and use it sometimes God has
[1:30:35] done to help us and I can stand here all
[1:30:41] evening talk about them things and you
[1:30:42] know it from the dead raised to angels
[1:30:46] three times to see in garden when I was
[1:30:48] 11 years old I can talk to you about a
[1:30:50] lot of things with another one of those
[1:30:53] and I put as my experience with the
[1:31:03] revelation of Jesus Christ which is what
[1:31:09] brother Branham what is the new verb
[1:31:12] Christ mister God revealed he said it's
[1:31:16] a revelation of Jesus Christ personally
[1:31:19] to you do you have that experience in
[1:31:30] that way you're doing away with things
[1:31:33] and you're getting away from and that we
[1:31:35] all believe in the signs and the wonders
[1:31:37] that you can be right in the middle of
[1:31:40] the devil's trap with your signs and
[1:31:42] wonders but you cannot be in a devil's
[1:31:46] trap if you've got the revelation of
[1:31:49] Jesus Christ may I quote brother Ronnie
[1:31:53] the devil can't bring the word so then I
[1:31:59] put everything I've got on what he's
[1:32:00] giving me with the word let's stand
[1:32:03] together what we've got

[1:34:33] salvation that Jesus Christ is revealed
[1:34:39] to each and everyone of us personally to
[1:34:43] us not as a group or at all but as an
[1:34:47] individual reveal the person of Jesus
[1:34:50] Christ we know that each one of the
[1:34:53] apostles and prophets had that
[1:34:56] revelation for their time and they were
[1:35:00] built upon that and we take because we
[1:35:05] miss that scripture which had built on
[1:35:06] the foundation of the Apostles that's
[1:35:09] New Testament Lord and prophets their
[1:35:11] prophets in the New Testament but this
[1:35:14] revelation is built upon all the
[1:35:17] prophets down through time and then the
[1:35:20] Apostles having the same revelation of
[1:35:23] Jesus Christ we love you and we thank
[1:35:26] you in Jesus name you dismissed
