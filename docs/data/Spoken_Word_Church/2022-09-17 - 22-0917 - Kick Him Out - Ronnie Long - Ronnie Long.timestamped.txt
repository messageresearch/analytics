[35:12] how many how many in here just just
[35:14] curious uh maybe just the young people

[35:19] church in a message home
[35:21] how about the old people in the back how
[35:23] many was born into a message home
[35:25] and it's pretty near 100
[35:27] pretty close pretty close i'm not
[35:29] putting you in a sub category if you
[35:31] weren't
[35:32] just curious
[35:34] in the 25th
[35:36] verse
[35:37] and they returned from searching of the
[35:39] land after 40 days and they went and
[35:41] came to moses and to aaron and to all
[35:44] the congregation of the children of
[35:45] israel unto the wilderness of puran and
[35:47] kadesh
[35:48] and brought back word unto them and unto
[35:50] all the congregation and showed them the
[35:52] fruit of the land and they told him and
[35:55] said we came unto the land whether thou
[35:57] sentest us
[35:58] and surely it floweth with milk and
[36:00] honey and this is the fruit of it
[36:03] nevertheless the people be strong that
[36:05] dwell in that land and the cities are
[36:08] walled and very great and moreover we
[36:11] saw the children of enact there if you
[36:13] don't you of course your bible studies
[36:15] know that those are those are giants
[36:17] the amount the amalekites dwell in the
[36:19] land of the south and the hittites and
[36:21] the jebusites and the amorites dwell in
[36:23] the mountains and the canaanites dwell
[36:25] by the sea and by the coast of jordan
[36:28] and caleb stilled the people
[36:30] before moses and said let us go up at
[36:32] once and possess it for we are able to
[36:34] overcome it but the men that went up
[36:36] with him said be not able we be not able
[36:38] to go up against the people for they are
[36:41] stronger than we and they brought up an
[36:43] evil report of the land which they had
[36:45] searched unto the children of israel
[36:46] saying the land
[36:48] through which we have gone to search it
[36:51] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[36:53] thereof
[36:54] and all the people that we saw in it are
[36:56] men of great stature
[36:58] and there we saw the giants the sons of
[37:01] a knack which come of the giants and we
[37:03] were in our own sight
[37:05] as grasshoppers and so we were
[37:09] in their sight
[37:11] may god bless his word let's just bow
[37:12] our heads

[38:22] we just we just want you to feel welcome
[38:24] father we want to invite you into every
[38:26] heart lord every mind father may every
[38:28] spirit be subject under your word now we
[38:30] pray father in the name of jesus christ
[38:33] amen amen you may be seated
[38:36] just a couple minutes this afternoon i
[38:38] like to just take a pretty simple topic
[38:40] ask me for a title and i say well the
[38:41] only title i have is kick him out
[38:45] there's somebody else in your house it's
[38:46] time to kick them out amen i believe
[38:48] that us as we raise our hands that we
[38:51] were brought into this message if we
[38:52] weren't born into it maybe we've been
[38:54] into it for some years and we've heard
[38:56] enough preaching to last a lifetime
[38:58] we've heard enough of the word to last a
[39:00] lifetime but it's time to put it into
[39:02] action it's time to take what we believe
[39:05] and put it into action there's there's
[39:07] somebody else living in your land and
[39:08] where i got this context from or read
[39:10] this quote i know
[39:11] i couldn't get it to email to you but
[39:13] it's in um
[39:14] the power of the devil you said well can
[39:16] i plug your your tablet in here i said
[39:18] well you don't want to read my chicken
[39:19] scratch on here so it wouldn't make any
[39:21] sense to you all anyway but brother
[39:23] bannon would say the devil's nothing but
[39:24] a bluff anyhow snorting and blowing all
[39:26] thunder and no lightning but i tell you
[39:29] brother the lightning power of the
[39:30] resurrected jesus christ puts a reality
[39:32] there that shocks the soul from a dead
[39:34] slumber of these earthly bound things
[39:37] into the immortal realms to believe god
[39:39] and take him at his word and call those
[39:41] things which are not as though they were
[39:43] amen redeemed by the blood of the lamb
[39:45] called out set aside a church bought and
[39:48] washed and ironed out without spot or
[39:51] wrinkle now he's talking about us the
[39:52] church somebody say he's talking about
[39:54] me say me he's talking about me
[39:57] without spot or wrinkle that's what he's
[40:00] coming for god help us to get our faith
[40:02] in the right place tonight to move out
[40:04] on the battlegrounds there and say satan
[40:07] you're a liar jesus christ died to make
[40:09] me free and it's mine somebody say it's
[40:12] mine
[40:13] somebody say it's mine
[40:15] now think about your possession the
[40:17] victory that you have desire i don't
[40:18] believe you came in here this afternoon
[40:20] just to sit in a pew or to get free
[40:22] pizza but i believe you have something
[40:24] on your mind that you're looking for god
[40:26] to come and deliver to you i say it's
[40:28] time to visualize that and say it's mine
[40:31] it's mine you can see yourself walking
[40:33] in victory he says get out of here
[40:35] you went to your home tonight you
[40:37] legitimate people and there's a bunch of
[40:39] drunks in there kicking around and
[40:41] carrying around smoking drinking cursing
[40:43] and living immorally you'd say hey get
[40:45] out of here this is my house brother tim
[40:48] if somebody was in your house when you
[40:49] got home tonight and there was somebody
[40:51] else carrying on in there you wouldn't
[40:52] just let him be in there right
[40:55] you wouldn't just let him sit in there
[40:56] brother bob you wouldn't just let
[40:57] somebody just come into your house and
[40:59] have some stranger have their muddy
[41:00] boots up on your couch
[41:02] i believe you'd walk in there and say
[41:04] hey this is my house
[41:05] you're you're sitting in my chair get
[41:08] out but but most of the time we'll let
[41:10] the devil come right into our home and
[41:12] come right into our life and we'll just
[41:14] let him we'll let him take up a
[41:16] residency there and he'll have our best
[41:18] chair and he'll have the most
[41:19] comfortable seat in the house and we
[41:21] don't have the courage within us to say
[41:22] hey this is my house get out
[41:25] but i think by the power of the word
[41:27] that we're living under it's been
[41:29] affirmed to us that we have the
[41:31] authority to say this is my house
[41:34] get out
[41:35] so remember this is your victory i can't
[41:38] pronounce your victory for you but
[41:39] you've got to know what you have
[41:42] requested of the lord maybe you've
[41:44] desired the holy ghost you've desired
[41:46] healing in your life you just desired a
[41:48] greater victory or to walk in a greater
[41:50] light than you've ever known or or maybe
[41:52] to get healing in your body whatever it
[41:54] is
[41:54] you've got to recognize that it's
[41:56] already yours but there's a devil
[41:58] between you and there
[42:00] there's a hindrance between you and
[42:02] there
[42:02] i believe it's time to walk out in total
[42:04] victory
[42:06] now imagine if you went into your house
[42:07] and say this is my house you'd say oh
[42:09] i'm a human being this was built for
[42:11] human beings and i've got a right here
[42:13] you'd say this is my house i have an
[42:15] abstract deed that proves this is my
[42:18] property then if you show him the deed
[42:20] he will not move then there is a law
[42:22] down here that will make him move
[42:25] right
[42:26] so if you took that word to the
[42:28] authorities and you took that that that
[42:30] title deed you said this is my house i
[42:32] have the deed to it and there's a
[42:33] squatter in my house now the law would
[42:35] show up and they would make that man get
[42:38] out of your house right
[42:40] now you know that as a citizen you have
[42:43] those rights as an american everybody in
[42:44] here american citizen you have those
[42:47] rights that if you went to the law and
[42:48] you say there's somebody in my house
[42:51] then by law they would have to be
[42:52] removed
[42:53] but i believe as christians we have a
[42:55] greater law i believe as endtime
[42:57] believers we have a greater law that is
[42:59] exercised for us that if we could
[43:02] recognize that and say we have a law
[43:04] that protects us from you being in my
[43:06] house
[43:07] but we've got to exercise that law
[43:10] and if that devil that come to you
[43:12] tonight tried to send you to a premature
[43:14] grave try to you up read god's
[43:16] abstract deed and by his stripes we were
[43:18] healed and if you don't want to believe
[43:20] that there's a holy ghost here the law
[43:23] of god that'll kick him out that'll
[43:25] prove it
[43:26] just ring up jesus
[43:28] jesus central say j-e-s-u-s find out if
[43:31] there's something that don't take place
[43:33] the angels of god will take their
[43:34] positions and that devil will get out
[43:37] you can stand there on your toes and say
[43:39] yes sir it's the truth amen not up here
[43:41] or down here you've read your title
[43:43] clear you know what it is oh my feel
[43:46] like taking wings sometime and fly away
[43:48] don't you when you think of that lift up
[43:51] lift up above the shadows give me
[43:52] fellowship divine yes sir stand up in
[43:54] there where all the things are possible
[43:57] somebody say all things
[43:59] now are some of the things possible
[44:02] all things somebody say all things
[44:05] all things are possible stand up there
[44:07] where enoch did my when he took a little
[44:09] stroll one afternoon with god and walked
[44:12] on home with him just didn't want to
[44:13] come back hallelujah not one morning or
[44:16] or one evening the rapture the
[44:18] resurrection he had a testimony that he
[44:20] pleased god because he believed god now
[44:23] that sounds too simple right
[44:25] that enoch's testimony wasn't that he
[44:27] knew all the mysteries or he knew all
[44:29] the revelations or that he knew where to
[44:31] find that quote or that exact text but
[44:33] the testimony that enoch had that he
[44:35] walked with god was that he believed god
[44:38] now i find that we we see ourselves
[44:40] living in a condition that that is under
[44:43] our privileges because we simply don't
[44:45] take god at his word now i think every
[44:47] individual in this building is guilty of
[44:49] that we're all we're all guilty of
[44:51] letting our humanity come in the way but
[44:53] i believe we're getting to an age into a
[44:55] time and we're living in a different
[44:57] dispensation where we are rising above
[44:59] just this humanity or what these three
[45:01] dimensions can hold but but we're seeing
[45:03] a supernatural god in action at this
[45:07] time on earth now i'm not going to
[45:08] settle for what i had last year i'm not
[45:10] going to settle for what i had 10 years
[45:12] ago or 15 years ago we've got to be
[45:14] walking in a current light with god is
[45:16] that all right somebody say right now
[45:20] right now god is on the move not
[45:22] tomorrow not yesterday but right now god
[45:24] is on the move and we've got to be
[45:26] walking in step with him right
[45:28] so we can come by we can ask ourselves
[45:30] and i could pass the mic we'd go one by
[45:32] one and say now why do you believe what
[45:34] we believe and somebody say well i don't
[45:36] know
[45:37] somebody say well i believe it because
[45:39] my my parents believed her i believe it
[45:41] because my grandpa believed it or or my
[45:43] mama made me come here or i don't really
[45:45] want to be here whatever the answer is
[45:47] we've got to recognize the living truth
[45:49] is in our midst now
[45:51] not just
[45:52] not just in 1965 or back in another age
[45:56] gone by but we're walking in the light
[45:58] now
[45:59] somebody say now
[46:02] now
[46:03] not yesterday not in another age not
[46:05] back in paul's age or john's age or even
[46:07] when jesus was walking in sandals but
[46:10] right now we are walking in a living
[46:12] light we're not looking for something to
[46:14] come but it's already come we're not
[46:16] looking for for the prophet to come back
[46:18] and to tell us something he didn't
[46:19] already tell us but we're walking in a
[46:21] living light already now right
[46:24] not waiting for something but it's
[46:25] already come he says that's what we need
[46:28] that's what we want is that what you
[46:30] want
[46:31] now you'd have to be a pretty pretty in
[46:34] pretty bad shape to not raise your hand
[46:35] to say i want the lord to come in and
[46:37] take total control of my situation
[46:40] i don't know what your situation is it
[46:42] might be it might be depression it might
[46:44] be uh health it might be diabetes it
[46:46] might be a foggy mind it might be
[46:47] unbelief you might be unsure about what
[46:49] i'm saying it might be confusion you
[46:52] might think that you're just walking in
[46:53] victory that's that's wonderful walk on
[46:55] in victory
[46:56] it might be a complex that somebody put
[46:58] on you whatever your situation is god is
[47:01] able to remove that but we must
[47:03] recognize who we are in this hour now
[47:06] the fault of israel there those 10 spies
[47:09] that went they they testified of their
[47:12] faults in the scripture and they said we
[47:14] saw ourselves as grasshoppers
[47:17] now them giants didn't say you're
[47:19] grasshoppers them giants didn't call
[47:21] them grasshoppers they didn't even get
[47:22] close enough to him but the scripture
[47:24] says that they saw themselves as
[47:27] grasshoppers and so they were in the
[47:29] sight of the giants because that's how
[47:31] they saw themselves i'm not going to
[47:33] raise my hand in this hour and say i'm
[47:34] just a grasshopper i'm just lowly and
[47:37] meek and i've got no power i've got no
[47:39] authority i've got no right but i
[47:41] believe we've been positionally placed
[47:43] into the body of christ not just to know
[47:46] it in letter but to actually perform it
[47:48] indeed to actually put a faith in action
[47:51] in this time to say it's my land it's
[47:54] time to take it back
[47:56] you always sing this song i i went to
[47:58] the enemy's camp and i took back what he
[48:00] stole from me
[48:02] he's stolen joy
[48:03] he's stolen freedom he's put you in
[48:06] bondage he's put you he's put you in
[48:08] chains he's he's told you you can't
[48:09] worship he's told you you've got as far
[48:12] as you can
[48:13] in this belief
[48:15] well let me just say that devil's a liar
[48:16] you have not gotten as far as you can in
[48:19] what we believe there is no limit to how
[48:21] far you can get now now being born into
[48:24] this now did somebody tell you or or did
[48:26] you have to find it yourself that you
[48:28] capped yourself off
[48:30] to what your faith could reach well
[48:32] that's just a little bit out there
[48:34] that's just a little bit higher and you
[48:36] know it seemed like maybe 20 years ago
[48:38] if if you were really to preach the son
[48:39] of man nobody would know where you were
[48:41] coming from maybe 30 years ago nobody
[48:44] would understand they say this man's
[48:45] blasphemy he's preaching that deity is
[48:48] in the body of christ but now we preach
[48:49] that on a regular basis and we believe
[48:52] it with all our heart but who told them
[48:53] 30 years ago that that was not the truth
[48:56] you understand where you're walking
[48:57] you're not living where 30 years ago was
[48:59] you're living in today's light it's a
[49:01] different light of this age
[49:03] now you can't expect to be harvested in
[49:05] march's light
[49:06] right the light of a march spring will
[49:09] not harvest that plant but we're living
[49:11] in the harvest time
[49:13] this all right am i going too fast
[49:15] just relax a little bit
[49:17] bro all right
[49:19] maybe you all raised your hand that you
[49:21] were you were you were born in the
[49:22] message so i assume
[49:24] you know where i'm coming from right
[49:25] right
[49:26] we cannot rely
[49:28] when they came into pentecost they could
[49:30] not rely on luther's message
[49:32] they cannot rely on wesley's message
[49:34] they had to see their own message for
[49:36] their own light now we coming into
[49:37] another light we cannot rely on what
[49:40] they believed on a hundred years ago in
[49:42] 1909 we cannot we can't believe that
[49:45] that will not get us all the way through
[49:47] we've got to have that and more
[49:49] we've got to have what luther preached
[49:51] and more right
[49:52] so now we know we're walking in a
[49:54] prevailing revelation that we're walking
[49:56] in step with the word right
[49:58] remember when brother branham saw you in
[50:00] the vision and he saw with that quote
[50:02] there i just read that there would be a
[50:03] spotless spotless bride without spot or
[50:06] wrinkles should be walking in the word
[50:08] walking in step with the word so we're
[50:11] continuing on in this we're not putting
[50:13] a cap and say you know you just got to
[50:15] be content to sit in that pew and be
[50:17] handed what you're given
[50:19] when did that become a normal thing for
[50:21] the church of the living god to just
[50:23] just take what you're given and that's
[50:25] what you're given now the woman with the
[50:26] blood issue she was handed a death
[50:28] sentence there they couldn't figure it
[50:29] out they couldn't find it they couldn't
[50:31] they couldn't heal it they couldn't cure
[50:33] it but she didn't just take what she was
[50:35] given she recognized who was walking on
[50:37] the earth at that time i believe there's
[50:41] the same christ walking on the earth at
[50:43] this time i am not satisfied just taking
[50:46] what i'm given in this life but i
[50:48] believe we're called to take him at his
[50:50] word and to remove any hindrance in our
[50:53] life to remove any giant in our land now
[50:55] we look over there and we see the
[50:56] victory right you see what i'm preaching
[50:59] to you see that you can walk in total
[51:00] victory and you can praise them like you
[51:02] desire to and you can walk in total
[51:04] faith but there's a giant standing in
[51:06] between you and that
[51:08] you see we've got to have the eyes of
[51:10] faith to know that that's already my
[51:11] land over there and if that's my land
[51:13] there's a law protecting me that says i
[51:16] can have it back
[51:18] now when those spies gather there they
[51:20] used to live in that land their
[51:21] forefathers lived in that land you see
[51:23] they were told how beautiful the land
[51:25] was and how great the land was but it
[51:27] had been it had been something 400
[51:29] something years since they'd been there
[51:31] right so those individuals had never
[51:33] actually been in that land they were
[51:35] born into slavery but they'd heard
[51:38] they had heard of a land
[51:40] now many of these young people sitting
[51:42] here you maybe you've heard of a
[51:44] supernatural testimony taking place for
[51:46] this brother over here you've heard of
[51:48] god moving on the scene over there or
[51:50] maybe back in you know when you're your
[51:52] pastor preached the convention you heard
[51:53] this the spirit of god move or you heard
[51:55] it last sunday for somebody else but
[51:57] you've got to see it with your own eyes
[52:01] you've got to believe that it's for you
[52:02] and it's it's it's for your time
[52:05] it's not for the neighbor or it's not
[52:07] for tomorrow it's not for just brother
[52:09] wade or it's not just for brother bob
[52:11] but it's for you in your time this is
[52:14] the bride's time right
[52:16] we're not living in the wrong age you
[52:18] weren't supposed to have cowboy boots
[52:20] and spurs
[52:21] you're living in the age that god
[52:23] thought of you to be in
[52:24] you're not you're not born out of season
[52:26] you're not born out of time you're
[52:27] walking in the perfect vision of god
[52:31] this is where he saw you so if god saw
[52:33] you already here then he gave you what
[52:36] it's going to take to overcome this age
[52:38] right we are living in the darkest age i
[52:40] don't know if there's a the the the
[52:42] mural with the ages on it but we're
[52:43] living in the darkest age right there
[52:45] there's there's just barely a sliver of
[52:47] light there that represents us thank god
[52:50] that there's a sliver of light there
[52:51] because there is a bride on the earth
[52:53] today that is walking in victory we're
[52:55] not defeated we're not walking with our
[52:57] head down we're not walking pretending
[52:59] that we know what we're talking about
[53:00] but we are walking in total victory
[53:02] because we recognize that messiah is on
[53:05] the earth living in the body
[53:07] i believe it's us i i can't speak for
[53:09] you but i say hey it's me
[53:12] it's me now not not sometime in the in
[53:15] the future when when something comes to
[53:17] pass but brother braham said all things
[53:19] have been fulfilled already we are now
[53:21] walking in victory if we can only
[53:23] recognize now we can't control the
[53:25] circumstance that come to us but we
[53:26] can't control how we react to that
[53:29] circumstance is that circumstance going
[53:31] to tell you how high you can rise or are
[53:33] you going to just look past that giant
[53:35] and be able to see total victory
[53:38] now the devil would love for you to sit
[53:39] there in your seat and be so depressed
[53:42] in yourself and to be and be coming at
[53:44] your own mind with every angle you can
[53:46] think of of why it's not you
[53:49] but wouldn't it be easier just to
[53:50] believe it's you wouldn't it be easier
[53:52] just to get rid of all the doubt and
[53:54] just say i believe that i'm fulfilling
[53:57] this scripture in this age he's talking
[53:59] about me he's not talking about another
[54:02] group but he is talking about me right
[54:04] now in my situation in my flesh in my
[54:06] circumstance he's talking about me
[54:10] now when royalty is born they didn't
[54:12] have to tell uh prince charles that he
[54:15] was going to be the next king
[54:17] he already knew that he was born under
[54:19] the right bloodline that when the queen
[54:20] passed away he would be the next king
[54:23] right
[54:24] he already knew that it was already
[54:25] within him nobody had to tell him that
[54:27] but when you're born into another
[54:29] kingdom when you're born into this
[54:31] kingdom of which i'm talking about it
[54:32] comes with entitlement
[54:35] it comes with rights it comes with a new
[54:37] bloodline and you're entitled to every
[54:40] promise that is promised that psalms 103
[54:43] is already yours when you're baptized
[54:45] into this body when you receive him in
[54:47] fullness when you when you walk in the
[54:49] holy ghost every right is yours
[54:53] now how many exercise every every one of
[54:55] those rights
[54:58] how many how many sick people exercised
[55:00] by his stripes were healed now it's one
[55:02] thing to testify with your lips but it's
[55:03] another thing to walk in it and see it
[55:06] happen
[55:07] friends i i i can't i can't explain this
[55:10] in a better way than to say that i've
[55:12] seen more of god this year than i have
[55:14] in my entire walk put together i've seen
[55:17] god move on the scene more this year
[55:19] than i have in my entire testimony since
[55:21] i've been serving the lord what is it
[55:22] we're reaching another level
[55:25] but we've got to recognize that we're
[55:26] moving up we cannot stay behind in
[55:28] yesterday's hour we cannot stay behind
[55:30] in yesterday's day we've got to
[55:32] recognize that we're walking in a higher
[55:34] level
[55:35] we're seeing things that we didn't see
[55:37] 10 years ago
[55:39] what has the word changed
[55:42] have we been preaching different quotes
[55:44] by the way
[55:46] no but the bride is recognizing
[55:48] who she is
[55:50] we know the quote when she recognizes
[55:52] who she is she will be an invincible
[55:55] army right but there's a catch to that
[55:57] you've got to recognize who you are
[56:00] somebody say it's me it's me he's
[56:02] talking about me this this this word of
[56:05] encouragement that comes through the
[56:06] prophet's lips is not talking about
[56:08] another group or another race or some
[56:10] people are far off he's talking about me
[56:14] now you can look at the message a couple
[56:16] different ways you could say well you
[56:18] know it's just a bunch of negativity and
[56:20] it speaks about judgment it speaks about
[56:22] hell he's not talking to me when he's
[56:24] talking about that but when he's talking
[56:26] about walking in perfect victory when
[56:28] he's talking about taking off of this
[56:30] old garment of sorrow and putting on a
[56:31] garment of praise he's talking to me
[56:34] somebody say me
[56:36] he's not talking that it's going to come
[56:37] but he's saying it's already here
[56:40] my message is to declare
[56:43] that he is here
[56:45] right
[56:46] i don't believe that we should have to
[56:47] water down i hope you're okay with this
[56:49] i don't believe we should have to water
[56:50] down our youth services because i
[56:51] believe you all hear the truth of the
[56:53] hour i believe you're just as far along
[56:55] you're you're further along sometimes
[56:57] than a lot of people that have been in
[56:58] the message their entire lives because
[57:00] you're you're called and elected to
[57:02] receive it in this hour
[57:05] now when you recognize that you're
[57:06] coming to this kingdom and you've taken
[57:08] on the holy ghost which is not just uh i
[57:10] raised my right hand and i solemnly
[57:11] swear that i'll be a member of this
[57:13] church and i'll follow this message for
[57:15] the rest of my life no when you actually
[57:16] take on the life of christ within you
[57:19] there are rights that come with that
[57:21] with that citizenship
[57:23] is that it right
[57:25] have you moved over here from another
[57:26] country
[57:27] you used to be under that country's laws
[57:29] right you used to be under that
[57:31] countries and maybe they didn't protect
[57:32] you as good maybe they didn't have uh
[57:34] social security and maybe they didn't
[57:36] have the benefits that we have here in
[57:38] the united states but when you became a
[57:40] citizen of the united states
[57:42] every right that every other citizen has
[57:45] is now yours right
[57:47] what's the same with coming into the
[57:49] kingdom of god brother wade does not
[57:51] have rights that you don't have if you
[57:53] come into the kingdom of god you're
[57:54] entitled to the same word of prophecy
[57:57] that he's entitled to or that i'm
[57:58] entitled to or that brother louise is
[58:00] entitled we're all walking in the same
[58:03] kingdom right there's no big eyes or or
[58:05] big knees and little yous we're all
[58:07] walking under the same authority when
[58:09] you recognize where you're living
[58:12] now the hour
[58:13] in this age everybody's fighting for
[58:15] their rights everybody's fighting for
[58:17] for uh black lives matter or or lgbtq
[58:21] rst rights or whatever it is everybody's
[58:24] fighting for their rights and yet the
[58:26] people of god sit there and they take
[58:28] what the devil gives them and they think
[58:30] that's how they have to live
[58:32] not anymore i say from today on you've
[58:34] got to recognize in your heart i'm
[58:36] kicking him out
[58:37] maybe there's a devil been living in
[58:39] your life and been bringing you down and
[58:41] bringing you sorrow and telling you that
[58:42] you're not ever going to make it and
[58:44] telling you that the rapture's going to
[58:45] pass you by i say it's time to kick him
[58:47] out
[58:48] take the word and use it for what it was
[58:50] meant for for authority to kick him out
[58:52] of your life kick him out of your house
[58:54] kick him out of your kingdom
[58:56] let the word do the cutting let the word
[58:58] cut off of that that devil that's been
[59:00] hanging on to your life and telling you
[59:02] that you're not going to make it you
[59:03] don't have the authority you don't have
[59:05] the faith that's the devil of
[59:06] condemnation and i say it's time to kick
[59:08] him out
[59:09] you've been given given the same
[59:11] promises that every man before you has
[59:13] been given that's come into this kingdom
[59:16] the same authority that peter was given
[59:18] when he would walk by someone and his
[59:19] shadow
[59:20] would do the healing
[59:22] that same authority lives within the
[59:24] bride in this hour
[59:25] the same authority that would take paul
[59:27] and silas out of a prison cell that
[59:29] would shake the walls loose and they
[59:30] would walk in freedom that same
[59:32] authority is in the bride in this hour
[59:36] we're walking in it now now we've got to
[59:38] change the way we're looking at it
[59:40] we've been given this well this is just
[59:42] the way i am
[59:43] that's just how i was meant to be i just
[59:46] i just have a woe is me kind of attitude
[59:49] i just have a debbie downer
[59:52] but that's not walking in victory
[59:54] you're saying i'm just a grasshopper in
[59:56] the sight of that giant
[59:58] i don't know how you look at yourself
[1:00:00] but you've got to see yourself how god
[1:00:01] sees you he sees his child when i when i
[1:00:04] look at my son or my daughter i don't
[1:00:06] see a lesser human being or somebody
[1:00:08] smaller i see i'll give my life for that
[1:00:11] person you've got to recognize that god
[1:00:12] sees you as his beloved he's not looking
[1:00:15] at you in some lesser manner thinking
[1:00:17] that he's not going to move on the scene
[1:00:19] for you like he did somebody else you're
[1:00:20] not a grasshopper in god's sight
[1:00:22] but what about your own faith what does
[1:00:24] it testify about yourself
[1:00:26] well we're just a grasshopper to this
[1:00:28] this is a dark hour we're living in this
[1:00:30] is a dark age and you know i thought we
[1:00:33] were just going to come in here and and
[1:00:34] he was just going to preach a simple
[1:00:36] sermon but this is what the lord gave me
[1:00:37] on my heart
[1:00:38] you know i thought he was going to make
[1:00:40] me feel good
[1:00:42] but i'm telling you who you are in this
[1:00:44] hour and by telling you who you are
[1:00:46] you're identifying what rights are yours
[1:00:49] the devil that comes to you and torments
[1:00:51] you at night you have a right to kick
[1:00:53] that devil out of your mind you have a
[1:00:55] right to kick that devil out of your
[1:00:57] home it's your right the law of god
[1:01:00] protects you from those things but
[1:01:02] you've got to recognize it's not a
[1:01:03] yesterday thing
[1:01:05] it's not just that if i do this and i
[1:01:07] carry my cross across the middle of the
[1:01:09] desert on my knees i'll be entitled to
[1:01:11] this but right now while i'm speaking
[1:01:14] these words you can come into this
[1:01:15] kingdom and you can be entitled to every
[1:01:18] right that a christian has
[1:01:21] it's yours already it's a living fire
[1:01:24] right it's not it's not a dead cold fire
[1:01:26] in another age gone by it's alive today
[1:01:28] right we sing the song he's alive and
[1:01:31] well
[1:01:32] living in me
[1:01:36] does it say he expired yesterday
[1:01:39] or that the faith of god only works for
[1:01:41] a certain amount of time and you know
[1:01:43] those things just don't happen anymore
[1:01:45] days of miracles has passed
[1:01:48] right it's the same old spirit that the
[1:01:49] prophet preached against you know those
[1:01:50] things don't happen anymore they don't
[1:01:52] happen around here
[1:01:54] wouldn't you like to be the change in
[1:01:55] that
[1:01:56] wouldn't you like to see the
[1:01:57] manifestation of the promises of god
[1:01:59] coming to pass in your church in your
[1:02:02] life in your circumstance and what your
[1:02:04] giant is in front of you wouldn't you
[1:02:06] like to see that same old david
[1:02:07] anointing strike you that same old
[1:02:10] joshua anointing strike you and say
[1:02:12] there's more for us than there is
[1:02:13] against us there's more on my side than
[1:02:16] there is against me we are given kingdom
[1:02:18] authority in this hour but we've got to
[1:02:20] recognize
[1:02:21] we are
[1:02:22] the bride in this hour
[1:02:24] we're not looking for something to come
[1:02:26] we're already there
[1:02:28] sisters if you knew the power that you
[1:02:30] hold within your faith if you could
[1:02:32] recognize that god gave you all that he
[1:02:34] was
[1:02:35] is laying in the church now he never
[1:02:37] intended for that power to lay dormant
[1:02:39] he intended it to defeat the devil
[1:02:41] any circumstance any time any place
[1:02:44] under any condition
[1:02:45] this word will defeat the devil but so
[1:02:48] many times we end up in the corner and
[1:02:50] we think somehow we're defeated or we're
[1:02:52] not able or we're just stuck with this
[1:02:54] circumstance
[1:02:56] i say kick him out
[1:02:58] i say take the word which you already
[1:03:00] have the knowledge of and kick him out
[1:03:04] oh he says oh my that takes the wishbone
[1:03:07] out and puts a backbone in there when
[1:03:09] you come to find out that jesus really
[1:03:11] we gotta we we he raised from the dead
[1:03:14] and is here tonight proving himself
[1:03:16] alive your faith in action
[1:03:19] your faith put in action so what drives
[1:03:21] the devil out your faith somebody say my
[1:03:24] faith
[1:03:26] my
[1:03:28] to think that you have the faith to
[1:03:29] drive out the devil
[1:03:31] now if you walk up to the devil and you
[1:03:33] come at him with a
[1:03:34] with a little bit of uh
[1:03:36] fear in you
[1:03:39] he's been defeating humans
[1:03:42] for ages for thousands of years you come
[1:03:45] to the devil with a little bit of doubt
[1:03:46] in your voice and you say it's my faith
[1:03:49] i think
[1:03:51] that devil's not going to move
[1:03:52] and maybe you've come up against this
[1:03:54] giant of which i'm talking about tonight
[1:03:56] you've tried it before and you said by
[1:03:58] maybe you worked up under emotion
[1:04:00] sometime and you said by faith be
[1:04:01] removed but there was an element of
[1:04:03] doubt in there that it just wasn't for
[1:04:05] you that devil will recognize that doubt
[1:04:08] he recognizes where that comes from but
[1:04:10] if you can ever get past that point that
[1:04:12] point of doubt to recognize that this
[1:04:14] word is for me this is my weapon this is
[1:04:17] my sword this is how i defeat him it's
[1:04:20] not it's not a mythical thing out there
[1:04:22] that maybe will come to a people one day
[1:04:24] but it's mine it's right now then you
[1:04:26] can say it's my face somebody say my
[1:04:29] faith
[1:04:30] my faith
[1:04:32] what's good is it going to do to read of
[1:04:34] a historical god if he isn't the same
[1:04:36] god today what's good is it going to do
[1:04:38] to read about old george washington if
[1:04:40] he's dead and gone it's just a history
[1:04:42] fact but jesus raised from the dead and
[1:04:44] he's the same today what good does it do
[1:04:47] to paint a fire to a freezing man show
[1:04:50] him a picture of a nice big warm fire
[1:04:51] and the man's a freezing that's
[1:04:54] something that was that's what people
[1:04:56] are trying to keep you alive by today no
[1:04:58] wonder we got a failure in america of
[1:05:00] religion no wonder the magazine says the
[1:05:02] spiritual ongoe is a burst is because
[1:05:04] they failed to represent the right thing
[1:05:06] to them they're trying to teach them of
[1:05:09] a historical god
[1:05:11] but what we need today is a god
[1:05:13] resurrected from the dead and on hand
[1:05:16] right now somebody say right now to do
[1:05:18] whatever he promised he would do to
[1:05:21] confirm his word and we need delegates
[1:05:24] out there in the audience who's willing
[1:05:25] to rest their soul on any word that god
[1:05:28] said and put it into action
[1:05:31] how many wants to fulfill that quote
[1:05:33] right there we need delegates out here
[1:05:34] in the audience that will take god at
[1:05:36] his word and will put it into action
[1:05:38] somebody say me
[1:05:40] somebody say i'll do it we got to have
[1:05:42] the same anointing that isaiah said here
[1:05:44] am i lord i may not be able in my flesh
[1:05:47] i may not think i'm i'm worthy in my
[1:05:49] flesh but here am i
[1:05:51] send me
[1:05:53] that's what we need today
[1:05:55] that's what we need is men and women who
[1:05:57] stand up to the forefront there and call
[1:05:59] the devil a liar say jesus christ
[1:06:01] stripped you and robbed you of every
[1:06:03] right you had and i'm in christ jesus
[1:06:06] and the world belongs to me amen right
[1:06:10] what good does it do to have a bird to
[1:06:12] have wings as long as you've got him in
[1:06:13] a cage he can't fly he don't need no
[1:06:15] wings if you've got him in a cage that's
[1:06:17] the way a lot of these people are
[1:06:19] they're in a cage taught of the days the
[1:06:21] miracles has passed oh there's a god oh
[1:06:23] yes we believe that jesus was a son i've
[1:06:26] accepted him as personal savior but i
[1:06:28] tell you all those things is back there
[1:06:29] in the old days
[1:06:31] their past
[1:06:32] how many is i had to encounter that
[1:06:34] devil of unbelief all those things are
[1:06:36] passed they're in another day gone by
[1:06:38] the days of miracles has passed what
[1:06:40] good's your wings going to do you
[1:06:43] what good's your faith to do you if you
[1:06:45] can't turn it loose what good is your
[1:06:47] faith going to do if you can't put it in
[1:06:49] action certainly if i believe jesus
[1:06:51] lives today i'll put it into action
[1:06:54] what good is it to say that we have a
[1:06:56] vindicated word of promise in this hour
[1:06:58] that it's infallible we can argue it
[1:07:00] till we're blue in the face and say
[1:07:01] there's no contradiction there's no
[1:07:03] mistake and yet we've not even put it
[1:07:05] into action yet
[1:07:07] hey we've got so concerned about proving
[1:07:09] this to ourselves we've missed that we
[1:07:11] can use it against the devil
[1:07:13] and we just take him at his word just
[1:07:15] say i believe this wholeheartedly it
[1:07:17] works
[1:07:18] let me say this message works
[1:07:20] it works when you need him it works when
[1:07:22] you think that there's no way out it
[1:07:23] works when when you're in desperation
[1:07:25] and you're crying out for help this
[1:07:27] message works we've already proven that
[1:07:29] to be so but let it work for you
[1:07:33] what good is it for god to give you
[1:07:34] wings if you're going to be in a cage
[1:07:36] your whole life what good is it for god
[1:07:38] to give you the ability to worship if
[1:07:39] you're never going to use it what good
[1:07:41] is it for god to give you breath in your
[1:07:43] lungs if you're never going to use it to
[1:07:44] glorify him
[1:07:46] brother that was playing the piano
[1:07:47] wonderful playing what good would it be
[1:07:49] for god to give you the gift to play the
[1:07:51] piano if you're not going to use it to
[1:07:52] glorify him
[1:07:54] what good would it be for god to give
[1:07:55] you discernment of the word to look over
[1:07:57] this and to know the quotes and to know
[1:07:59] that if you're not going to use it to
[1:08:00] glorify him it was not put here so we
[1:08:02] could argue back and forth about it it
[1:08:04] was put here so we could put it into
[1:08:06] action
[1:08:08] in our lives now maybe we'll talk to the
[1:08:10] back for a second how many mamas and
[1:08:12] daddies are ready to get the devil out
[1:08:13] of your house
[1:08:15] i've had enough of the devil in my house
[1:08:17] and dictating to me how my kids can go
[1:08:19] and what direction they're gonna take i
[1:08:21] say it's time to kick him out i say it's
[1:08:24] time to take the word that you've
[1:08:26] already been given and use it for the
[1:08:28] purpose it was given for and kicked the
[1:08:30] devil out
[1:08:32] what good is it to be given the gift of
[1:08:34] the holy ghost if you're just going to
[1:08:35] sit there
[1:08:36] if you're just going gonna wait on him
[1:08:37] to do something for you if you're gonna
[1:08:39] wait on some emotion to come by or the
[1:08:41] light to flicker or the chain to move
[1:08:43] what good is that
[1:08:44] god is waiting for somebody to put their
[1:08:46] faith into action
[1:08:49] this is our time this is our hour let me
[1:08:51] say are you the bride
[1:08:53] are you the bride over here
[1:08:55] you believe you're the bride
[1:08:57] is this your age
[1:08:58] is this where you live is this your your
[1:09:01] dimension here is this your time it's
[1:09:03] your time to let your word shine
[1:09:06] don't put it out to somebody else to do
[1:09:08] or just the pastor or just the ministry
[1:09:10] but the son of man ministry is in his
[1:09:13] bride it's in women it's in brothers
[1:09:15] it's in the it's in the in the pa girl
[1:09:18] it's in the the sound man back there
[1:09:20] it's in the drum player the ministry of
[1:09:22] this hour is in the bride
[1:09:26] why
[1:09:27] would it just be there
[1:09:29] if we were had to deal with whatever we
[1:09:30] were given
[1:09:32] maybe you were given uh just uh just a
[1:09:34] small portion
[1:09:37] but that's not what you're that's not
[1:09:38] your cap
[1:09:40] who told you you couldn't fly
[1:09:43] well gravity told me that well who who
[1:09:45] told you you couldn't walk in perfect
[1:09:47] victory in this word
[1:09:49] some devil told you that
[1:09:51] some devil came along and he told you
[1:09:53] that this was just the way it is that
[1:09:56] you're just going to continue to live
[1:09:58] under your means and just go from
[1:09:59] meeting to meeting and from paycheck to
[1:10:01] paycheck and you're never going to get
[1:10:03] ahead that's some devil that came into
[1:10:05] the church and told our young people
[1:10:06] that that they would have to live under
[1:10:08] this kind of expectation but i say it's
[1:10:11] time to kick that kind of expectation
[1:10:13] out of the church this word did not come
[1:10:15] in our hours so we can live under our
[1:10:17] our means or under our expectations but
[1:10:19] it came that we could have fullness that
[1:10:21] we could have life that we could get
[1:10:22] under the fountain and drink freely
[1:10:26] but my sometimes it seems that we've got
[1:10:27] a battle to get under that fountain
[1:10:29] we've got a battle to actually get
[1:10:30] underneath it
[1:10:32] that's right my we have to battle our
[1:10:34] own thoughts we got to battle traditions
[1:10:36] we got to battle uh false teaching we
[1:10:38] got to battle everything that the devil
[1:10:39] can throw at us
[1:10:41] not to mention the temptations of the
[1:10:42] world that you all face you all are
[1:10:44] facing more temptation and greater
[1:10:46] temptation than i faced in my day
[1:10:48] maybe i'm not that old but just in 10
[1:10:50] years a lot changes
[1:10:52] a lot of temptation changes the devil
[1:10:54] has greater access into your home than
[1:10:56] he did when i was a kid
[1:10:58] but you were put here to overcome him in
[1:11:01] this age
[1:11:02] you're not putting the stage wrong you
[1:11:04] don't put you weren't put in here that
[1:11:05] god just sends you through and hope you
[1:11:07] make it on the other side but god
[1:11:09] already saw you walking in total victory
[1:11:12] right by a prophet's vision he already
[1:11:15] saw a bride without spot
[1:11:17] he didn't say it would just be old
[1:11:18] people he saw a bride walking in this
[1:11:21] age without spot
[1:11:24] without sin
[1:11:25] above reproach
[1:11:26] not letting the devil work through their
[1:11:28] life he saw a bride made up of you and
[1:11:30] me walking in step with the word
[1:11:33] that's why we were given this word of
[1:11:35] this age so that we could overcome them
[1:11:38] in every situation under any
[1:11:39] circumstance
[1:11:41] now tell me what what what is greater
[1:11:43] than god
[1:11:45] is your doubt greater than god
[1:11:48] is your is your depression greater than
[1:11:49] god how about that anxiety you fight is
[1:11:51] it greater than god no but your faith
[1:11:53] must be put into action to recognize
[1:11:55] that god is not coming god is already
[1:11:59] here living in me to tell he's alive and
[1:12:02] well
[1:12:03] he already defeated that same enemy 2000
[1:12:06] years ago why don't you let him defeat
[1:12:08] him again today why don't you let that
[1:12:10] word of god strike a seed in here and
[1:12:12] let him defeat that enemy again today
[1:12:15] amen but we can't survive by a fire of
[1:12:18] yesterday
[1:12:19] if i drew you a picture of a nice flame
[1:12:21] and i put it out here would you get any
[1:12:23] warmth from it
[1:12:24] it wouldn't give you one bit of warmth
[1:12:26] but you have need a fire
[1:12:28] you know that you're cold you know that
[1:12:29] your hands are cold you want to get
[1:12:31] somewhere there's a fire if i paint you
[1:12:33] a picture of it it doesn't do anything
[1:12:34] for you let me say just to know that the
[1:12:37] pillar of fire came and it was over
[1:12:39] brother man's head it doesn't do
[1:12:40] anything for you if you don't recognize
[1:12:42] that it's right here in our midst in
[1:12:44] this hour
[1:12:45] it wasn't just back in
[1:12:47] 1963 when he was caught up it's right
[1:12:50] here in this hour
[1:12:53] angel lord didn't leave he's right here
[1:12:55] in this building
[1:12:57] but why would he come in here if he's
[1:12:59] just going to sit there and let you go
[1:13:00] through the same old dry routine
[1:13:03] and be stuck in the same old rut that
[1:13:05] you've been stuck in
[1:13:06] service in and service out waiting for
[1:13:08] god to do i sure wish god would come in
[1:13:10] here and do something miraculous
[1:13:12] all right brother
[1:13:14] well what hinders you
[1:13:17] why not you yeah
[1:13:18] why not let it shine on you
[1:13:20] why not let the revival come down and
[1:13:22] hit you could you imagine this brother
[1:13:24] man of somebody standing at the platform
[1:13:27] saying the baptism the holy ghost divine
[1:13:28] healing that's for another day
[1:13:31] it's like trying to introduce a man to
[1:13:33] freezing death freezing to death and
[1:13:35] paint him some fire for him
[1:13:37] and say that's a fine fire that's what
[1:13:39] was you can't warm by a painted fire
[1:13:42] you can't warm by uh by uh by a religion
[1:13:45] that died 60 years ago if you're basing
[1:13:48] on the man william branham it's a
[1:13:49] painted fire you've got to recognize
[1:13:51] where the word is today
[1:13:54] that was fire at one time but what about
[1:13:57] fire now holy ghost had power at
[1:13:59] pentecost through the first stage second
[1:14:01] age and on down what about this age he's
[1:14:03] the same holy ghost today the same power
[1:14:07] the same signs the same wonders the same
[1:14:09] miracles let me say same
[1:14:12] if he can get the same kind of faith
[1:14:15] amongst the people god doesn't change
[1:14:18] if he can get the same kind of faith do
[1:14:22] you know that if you were in that upper
[1:14:23] room on that day you would not act any
[1:14:25] different than you are right now
[1:14:28] it's not in a greater portion back then
[1:14:30] there wasn't just a greater outpouring
[1:14:32] of his presence back then
[1:14:33] you know if you were in brother braden's
[1:14:35] meetings you would not act any different
[1:14:36] than you are right now
[1:14:38] you know brother branham came up in here
[1:14:39] and brother wade was doing the
[1:14:40] introduction he said i have a special
[1:14:42] treat for you today
[1:14:43] reverend william branham is going to
[1:14:45] come out to the pulpit do you know you
[1:14:46] would not act any different than you are
[1:14:48] right now
[1:14:50] maybe you don't
[1:14:53] but i'm going to tell you that's the
[1:14:54] truth
[1:14:55] he said jesus couldn't heal you anymore
[1:14:58] if he was standing here in his corporal
[1:15:00] body than he could right now because the
[1:15:03] power which he left is what what was in
[1:15:06] him to heal the sick to begin with that
[1:15:08] same power is here in the church of the
[1:15:10] living god that same fire is here that
[1:15:12] was in the upper room that same
[1:15:14] anointing that was on william branham is
[1:15:16] here
[1:15:17] there's only one perfect gift sent to
[1:15:19] every age that gift is coming on but
[1:15:21] that same power is here in the church
[1:15:25] prophesied speaking in tongues uh uh
[1:15:27] healing the sick
[1:15:29] we've witnessed it just this year i've
[1:15:31] witnessed every gift work in the church
[1:15:33] accurately
[1:15:35] god is not dead
[1:15:37] he's not he's not backed up
[1:15:39] he's not dwindled in faith or dwindled
[1:15:41] in power he's waiting for somebody to
[1:15:43] use the same faith
[1:15:46] the same faith they would come under
[1:15:47] that anointing and under that anointing
[1:15:49] for the rep say you feel that there's a
[1:15:50] connection between us you feel that
[1:15:52] there's something taking place between
[1:15:54] us
[1:15:55] you've stepped into the presence of the
[1:15:57] angel
[1:15:58] you feel that
[1:16:00] i've stepped into that same presence i
[1:16:02] know exactly what that angel feels like
[1:16:04] i know exactly what they were feeling
[1:16:05] when they came under that i don't you
[1:16:06] say well brother you weren't there
[1:16:08] i just just last year there was a
[1:16:10] meeting up at nathan bryant's church and
[1:16:12] there was a sister there that went to
[1:16:13] branham tabernacle and in that meeting
[1:16:16] she said afterwards she came and she
[1:16:18] talked to brother wayne she says this is
[1:16:19] the same anointing the same feeling was
[1:16:22] in this building that it was under
[1:16:23] brother branham's meetings
[1:16:25] see it wasn't any different or any
[1:16:26] lesser it felt exactly the same a holy
[1:16:29] hush came across and and the power of
[1:16:31] god was moving and and the sick were
[1:16:33] being healed it's the same anointing why
[1:16:34] because it wasn't william branham's
[1:16:36] anointing it was an angel's anointing
[1:16:39] and that same angel is here but why
[1:16:42] would he be here if he's not gonna
[1:16:43] change you
[1:16:45] why would he be here if he's gonna send
[1:16:46] you out with the same old the same old
[1:16:48] burden you had on you when you walked in
[1:16:50] this building he's here to change your
[1:16:52] life he's here to heal the sick he's
[1:16:55] here to save the lost he's here to
[1:16:57] restore that which was broken he's here
[1:16:59] to mend it that heart that's been hurt
[1:17:01] and it's been questioned and you're and
[1:17:03] you're wondering and you're struggling
[1:17:04] he's here to set it straight
[1:17:08] if we can just have the same faith but
[1:17:10] we can't get warm by a fire that
[1:17:12] somebody told you about
[1:17:14] i can tell you that we built a huge
[1:17:15] bonfire i could tell you testimonies
[1:17:17] right now
[1:17:18] of what the lord's doing but you've got
[1:17:19] to have your own testimony
[1:17:21] but it might build your faith that you
[1:17:23] could say well there's it's possible
[1:17:25] it's possible in this hour that
[1:17:27] somebody's building a bonfire there's a
[1:17:30] bonfire out there somewhere brother
[1:17:32] wade's not crazy he knows that there's a
[1:17:34] fire there's a fire happening in his
[1:17:36] soul and that's what he's trying to
[1:17:37] express across the pulpit hey get in the
[1:17:40] fire while it's hot
[1:17:42] this is a real fire you can get warm you
[1:17:44] can get lit
[1:17:45] come and get in the fire
[1:17:47] i like that brother brown said if you
[1:17:48] don't have something to say just tell
[1:17:50] them how your candle got lit but i think
[1:17:52] a lot of times men get behind the pulpit
[1:17:53] and they never lift their candle so i
[1:17:55] got anything to share but i'm here to
[1:17:57] tell you how my candle got lit is by
[1:17:59] coming under the authority of this word
[1:18:01] in this hour by recognizing that it's
[1:18:02] not just a letter on paper but it's a
[1:18:05] life alive in beings alive in flesh
[1:18:09] alive in lips and feet and hands it's
[1:18:12] not just a saying
[1:18:14] lord take these hands
[1:18:17] not just a nice song
[1:18:18] but it's a literal life of jesus christ
[1:18:21] living in men today living in women
[1:18:24] today testifying of his works and his
[1:18:26] goodness you do not have to walk out of
[1:18:28] here with whatever you walked in with
[1:18:30] you might have walked in this room
[1:18:32] carrying a burden of doubt a question of
[1:18:34] unbelief of wondering what's going to
[1:18:35] happen to to that so-and-so or wondering
[1:18:37] what's going to happen to you when you i
[1:18:39] say it's time to kick that devil out
[1:18:42] i say we've given up too much
[1:18:44] already i say we've given away the
[1:18:46] boundary too much already we've let the
[1:18:47] devil take and take and take and take i
[1:18:50] say it's time to take back what the
[1:18:52] enemy stole from you
[1:18:55] come on mamas and daddies you know what
[1:18:56] i'm talking about it's time to take back
[1:18:58] what the enemy stole from you he's
[1:19:00] encroached on your children he's
[1:19:02] encroached in your life he's encroached
[1:19:04] on on these young people sitting here no
[1:19:06] doubt many of your parents are sitting
[1:19:07] back there pulling for you it's time to
[1:19:09] take back what the enemy stole from you
[1:19:13] it's yours
[1:19:14] it's yours to have
[1:19:16] it's not something afar out that's above
[1:19:18] your reach it's right here
[1:19:20] the angel
[1:19:21] moving in our midst
[1:19:23] not just so we could argue about it or
[1:19:25] we could feel a little emotional whoo
[1:19:28] but he's here to change lives
[1:19:32] he's here to set that crooked straight
[1:19:36] now we might have disappointments where
[1:19:38] we've prayed to the lord for things that
[1:19:39] didn't come to pass and we've waited and
[1:19:41] we've waited
[1:19:44] but he's here
[1:19:45] to change lives
[1:19:47] he's here to give you the desire of your
[1:19:49] heart you don't have to rely on your
[1:19:51] daddy's testimonies i remember growing
[1:19:52] up
[1:19:54] i remember growing up as a kid and my my
[1:19:56] mom and dad came in the message back in
[1:19:58] california and and they they would share
[1:20:00] these testimonies of things that would
[1:20:02] happen back in the church back then
[1:20:04] back in the 80s it seemed like we had a
[1:20:06] a real revival going through the message
[1:20:08] and there was supernatural done and
[1:20:09] there was mighty works of god going on
[1:20:11] but then i was born in the late 80s and
[1:20:13] by the time i was hearing about it it
[1:20:14] was in the 90s and
[1:20:17] i'm thinking where are all the miracles
[1:20:20] well that's nice
[1:20:22] it's nice that you have those stories
[1:20:23] yeah i get so encouraged my dad say oh
[1:20:25] you should have been there in this
[1:20:26] meeting and the power of god fell and
[1:20:28] this happened and this happened and
[1:20:31] and then you just look at it and say
[1:20:32] well that must have been for another age
[1:20:35] that must have been for another time
[1:20:36] gone by
[1:20:38] and then you associate it with well you
[1:20:39] know maybe maybe the power of god
[1:20:41] following in a meeting like that was
[1:20:43] just in brother branham's hour
[1:20:45] just to brother branham's time or
[1:20:47] maybe maybe those maybe those gifts were
[1:20:49] just extinguished out of the church or
[1:20:51] maybe divine healing doesn't exist
[1:20:53] anymore maybe those things just don't
[1:20:54] happen
[1:20:58] but eventually you get to a place where
[1:20:59] you recognize he's not changed
[1:21:02] his power's not decreased
[1:21:04] he's not changed the way he operates
[1:21:06] he's not changed his mind about his
[1:21:08] people he's not changed his mind about
[1:21:10] how he heals or how he delivers or how
[1:21:12] he shows up on the scene he's not
[1:21:13] changed his mind but the faith of men
[1:21:16] has got so mixed up and arguing about it
[1:21:18] now many of you were born into something
[1:21:20] that you didn't you didn't you didn't
[1:21:21] expect that to happen
[1:21:23] you were born into it right and you come
[1:21:25] into the middle of the scene if this is
[1:21:26] am i okay you come into the middle of
[1:21:29] the scene
[1:21:30] and there's quote wars going on
[1:21:32] and there's battling going on and and
[1:21:34] you've fallen into this
[1:21:36] and all of a sudden you're just you
[1:21:37] didn't ask for this but there's a war
[1:21:39] between this pastor and that pastor that
[1:21:41] you didn't even you weren't even there
[1:21:42] for
[1:21:43] but you heard about it and you think
[1:21:44] well
[1:21:45] i'm on this side
[1:21:47] and you heard this quote well i see it
[1:21:49] that way
[1:21:50] and you're born into a situation that
[1:21:52] you didn't have any control over but
[1:21:54] there will be somebody that overcomes
[1:21:56] that situation there will be somebody
[1:21:58] that actually looks at this word for
[1:22:00] themselves with their own eyes and say i
[1:22:02] take it for what it is
[1:22:04] i didn't ask for this uh opinion i
[1:22:06] didn't ask for this doubt or this
[1:22:08] question or this we don't we don't read
[1:22:10] that quote that way well let me ask how
[1:22:11] many quotes can you cut out
[1:22:13] before you've cut the whole thing out
[1:22:15] i say it's time for the the church of
[1:22:17] the living god and i think it's going to
[1:22:18] come through these young people here
[1:22:20] that's going to recognize i'll take the
[1:22:22] whole message nothing but the message i
[1:22:25] won't cut it i won't trim it i won't
[1:22:27] water it down i want it all
[1:22:29] i want it all i want him out of my house
[1:22:32] i want him out of my life i want it all
[1:22:36] but you see because we're born into the
[1:22:38] middle of this we have a superstition
[1:22:40] built up about about how we can act
[1:22:43] about what we can do about what liberty
[1:22:46] we can have right we don't want to get
[1:22:48] too crazy
[1:22:49] you won't be wildfire yeah
[1:22:51] don't be wildfire
[1:22:54] you wanna be you wanna be crazy like
[1:22:55] brother wade and billy ronnie
[1:22:58] there you see we've put a cap
[1:23:00] unknowingly
[1:23:02] on how we can operate under the
[1:23:04] influence of an angel we think we have
[1:23:06] to live under these expectations under
[1:23:08] this on this type of anointing and
[1:23:10] that's as far as we'll ever get but but
[1:23:12] but the word did not tell you that
[1:23:15] this message did not tell you that you
[1:23:17] can only live this high this message did
[1:23:19] not come to tell you that you can only
[1:23:21] have just this much water or this much
[1:23:23] of the love the life of christ but this
[1:23:25] message came to say he's here in
[1:23:28] fullness he's the same yesterday today
[1:23:31] and forever and all that god was he
[1:23:33] poured into christ and all that christ
[1:23:35] was he poured into his church all
[1:23:38] somebody say all
[1:23:40] is in the church in this hour we're not
[1:23:42] waiting for it to be poured out it's
[1:23:44] already in the church
[1:23:46] we've got to recognize we're moving in
[1:23:48] step with the word
[1:23:50] time for those old shackles to fall off
[1:23:53] time for that old giant i don't see
[1:23:54] myself as a grasshopper i see myself as
[1:23:57] a king and priest already in the kingdom
[1:23:59] of god
[1:24:00] i'm a son of god you're a daughter of
[1:24:02] god you're entitled to every redemptive
[1:24:04] right
[1:24:06] but if you don't recognize who's here
[1:24:08] it's like you're in another kingdom
[1:24:10] wandering around
[1:24:11] i wish my dad was here remember when you
[1:24:14] were a kid when you're real little and
[1:24:15] you say well my dad could beat up your
[1:24:16] dad
[1:24:18] with my daddy you see he has a better
[1:24:20] job than your daddy
[1:24:22] my daddy's truck's bigger than your
[1:24:24] daddy
[1:24:25] but you see the whole time daddy's not
[1:24:26] around
[1:24:27] you're just saying things and all the
[1:24:29] while you're thinking i hope daddy shows
[1:24:31] up
[1:24:33] i hope my big brother shows up i'm sure
[1:24:34] talking a lot of trash i want big
[1:24:36] brother to be here to back me up
[1:24:38] see that's what it's like when you're
[1:24:39] walking around in this kingdom and
[1:24:40] you're unaware of who you are you're
[1:24:43] saying these things are possible you're
[1:24:45] saying that the days of miracles is not
[1:24:47] passed and that god's still alive today
[1:24:49] and that this message is alive and true
[1:24:52] but if you have any element of doubt in
[1:24:54] there you're thinking i sure hope the
[1:24:55] pastor gets here pretty soon
[1:24:57] i sure hope so-and-so minister shows up
[1:24:59] here pretty soon or i'm sure hope
[1:25:01] brother branham would come back and
[1:25:02] write this or where's where's where's
[1:25:04] somebody to back me up here but you've
[1:25:05] got to recognize that you are already a
[1:25:07] citizen in that kingdom and your word is
[1:25:11] just as sure as any word that's come
[1:25:13] before you through the prophets your
[1:25:15] word is just like his word you've been
[1:25:18] adopted once you come into this holy
[1:25:19] ghost
[1:25:21] i believe we recognize that we've been
[1:25:23] taught it
[1:25:24] we've been we've been we've been quoted
[1:25:26] it but one day
[1:25:28] we're gonna live it
[1:25:30] one day we're gonna break through that
[1:25:31] barrier to say this isn't my daddy's
[1:25:33] testimonies this isn't just something
[1:25:35] afar off or that we used to hear about
[1:25:37] her i wish i lived in this day but
[1:25:39] you'll be able to walk and say i'm
[1:25:40] living in the best day that there ever
[1:25:43] has been i'm walking in a greater light
[1:25:45] than there ever has been i'm walking in
[1:25:47] complete perfected word
[1:25:49] that's where we're coming to recognize
[1:25:51] friends you were you young people you
[1:25:53] were born into the best age in my
[1:25:55] opinion
[1:25:56] that there ever was brother ram said if
[1:25:57] he could pick one
[1:25:59] he would pick this one because this is
[1:26:01] the age where god has rested his
[1:26:04] reputation on let me say to you young
[1:26:06] people brother what's your name
[1:26:08] philip god has rested his reputation on

[1:26:21] overcome complexes and fears and and
[1:26:24] anxieties god's god's name is on the
[1:26:26] line for you to overcome and be a a
[1:26:28] rightful son of god

[1:26:34] who's going to fulfill it
[1:26:36] some church down the road
[1:26:38] some other some other big big big camp
[1:26:40] down the road no he's going to work
[1:26:42] through a flock just like this
[1:26:45] that takes him at his word and says i'm
[1:26:46] not going to settle for just having this
[1:26:49] much i want it all i say if there's more
[1:26:52] of him to have i want it all now we can
[1:26:55] pass the mic and say do you believe that
[1:26:56] there's more of god for you to have in
[1:26:58] your life
[1:26:59] everyone would say yes i want more of
[1:27:00] god
[1:27:02] i want it all i want the devil so far
[1:27:05] removed from my life that the indwelling
[1:27:08] of god is radiating out of my being
[1:27:11] that i could walk in perfect faith and i
[1:27:13] could walk in perfect victory that the
[1:27:15] things i only imagined would be possible
[1:27:17] will be a reality to me i want it all
[1:27:21] i don't want to settle for just what the
[1:27:22] devil handed me i want a total victory
[1:27:25] somebody say me
[1:27:27] somebody say it's mine
[1:27:29] i want a total victory well let me say
[1:27:32] that he's here and he's here to give you
[1:27:34] a total victory you don't have to walk
[1:27:36] out of here with the same old regret
[1:27:38] that i wish i would have done something
[1:27:41] when you walk out of these doors but you
[1:27:42] can settle it even now
[1:27:46] settle it
[1:27:47] don't live by a painted fire
[1:27:49] don't live by something that you've
[1:27:50] heard is possible or you heard happen
[1:27:53] let's manifest it in your life let's see
[1:27:55] the manifestation of this message come
[1:27:57] out in the life of a young person in
[1:28:00] this hour say i want to be that person i
[1:28:02] want to be that young person this hour
[1:28:03] that lives this word so
[1:28:05] so real that it becomes manifested in me
[1:28:09] that's our desire as believers we're not
[1:28:11] here just to battle back and forth and
[1:28:13] quote shake hands see what you wore
[1:28:14] today see how well you sing and how good
[1:28:17] your pitch was we're here to manifest
[1:28:20] this word that we live for
[1:28:23] when did it become a tradition to give
[1:28:25] what the devil gave you just to settle
[1:28:27] for it just to walk in that
[1:28:29] think about old joshua
[1:28:32] when he recognized i'm not a bricklayer
[1:28:35] i'm not a brick maker there's something
[1:28:37] greater in me than just making these
[1:28:39] bricks
[1:28:40] you see i've become tradition to those
[1:28:41] israelites that they just make bricks
[1:28:43] right
[1:28:44] when they come to cadiz barnea and the
[1:28:46] ten spies went over and they brought
[1:28:47] back a report it had become tradition
[1:28:49] for them to walk around in the desert
[1:28:51] and eat manna
[1:28:52] and live under their privileges
[1:28:54] it had become a tradition for them
[1:28:57] god forbid that it becomes a tradition
[1:28:59] in the church of the living god just to
[1:29:01] take what you're given in this life just
[1:29:02] to take what the devil handed to you and
[1:29:04] say that's all i can get this is all i
[1:29:06] meant to be what if joshua and caleb
[1:29:09] would have had the same vision that
[1:29:10] those other ten spies had they'd still
[1:29:12] be in cadence barney they'd still be
[1:29:14] wandering around but there was something
[1:29:16] greater inside them they recognized this
[1:29:18] is our day this is our hour i will not
[1:29:21] settle for wandering around in the
[1:29:23] wilderness i have a land over there
[1:29:26] it's my land
[1:29:28] they didn't even see giants they saw
[1:29:30] their land this is the land that that
[1:29:33] abraham lived in this is the land that
[1:29:35] isaac lived in this is our land and
[1:29:38] there's a squatter sitting in your land
[1:29:41] and you might think i'm just crazy why
[1:29:43] are you why are you yelling and why are
[1:29:44] you screaming because i've recognized
[1:29:46] i've tasted of the grapes i've seen that
[1:29:49] there's a better land for you than where
[1:29:51] you're living you've got to recognize
[1:29:52] it's your land
[1:29:55] ah well i you i just i i i
[1:29:58] you see yourself as a grasshopper
[1:30:01] you've got to recognize you're an
[1:30:02] anointed called appointed elected
[1:30:06] inspired son and daughter of god to take
[1:30:09] back what the devil has already stolen
[1:30:11] from you it's your property
[1:30:14] when did god come in here and through
[1:30:16] the message or through the bible tell
[1:30:17] you that joy was not yours
[1:30:20] anybody
[1:30:21] anybody got a quote for me
[1:30:23] that joy's not yours
[1:30:25] anybody got a quote that you just have
[1:30:27] to be sad all the rest of your days
[1:30:29] anybody got a quote where you got to
[1:30:30] live in the gloom all the rest of your
[1:30:32] life let me have a quote
[1:30:40] and yet we live in that
[1:30:41] and yet we settle for that
[1:30:43] and we have a quote where you'd have to
[1:30:45] live with this disease the rest of your
[1:30:46] life
[1:30:47] anybody have a quote where you'd have to
[1:30:48] live in unbelief for the rest of your
[1:30:50] days brother you have a quote
[1:30:52] you
[1:30:53] no why because it doesn't exist because
[1:30:55] god promised you greater things than
[1:30:58] walking in this laodicean condition god
[1:31:00] promised you that you'd walk out in a
[1:31:02] perfect body god promised you that you'd
[1:31:04] walk out without sin without wrinkle
[1:31:06] without spot god promised you something
[1:31:08] greater than what this devil handed you
[1:31:11] in this age
[1:31:12] we've got to recognize it's me
[1:31:14] it's right now now's my time this is my
[1:31:17] hour my anointing the presence of god is
[1:31:19] here to change me from what i walked in
[1:31:22] that door with
[1:31:24] it's your time
[1:31:26] don't just live on somebody else's
[1:31:27] testimony have your own testimony
[1:31:31] here a couple months ago i was in
[1:31:32] australia remember i said maybe maybe
[1:31:34] sharing a testimonial let you know that
[1:31:35] there's a fire out there being built
[1:31:39] i was in australia a couple months ago
[1:31:41] and there was a young man there
[1:31:42] i was about my age maybe a little bit
[1:31:44] younger and we we talked he's from
[1:31:45] america ends up in australia and uh
[1:31:48] through
[1:31:49] circumstances he's running from the lord
[1:31:50] he ends up in australia ends up in him
[1:31:52] back in a message church in australia
[1:31:54] you see you can't run from the lord
[1:31:56] you can try but if you're elected you
[1:31:59] cannot outrun him he'll find you
[1:32:01] worried about your prodigal brother or
[1:32:03] sister he'll find him they can't outrun
[1:32:06] the reach of the lord and so this man
[1:32:08] finds himself there in in australia and
[1:32:10] he's helping out in the church a good
[1:32:11] brother just a wonderful wonderful man
[1:32:13] to be around and just feel
[1:32:15] just a kindred spirit there
[1:32:17] after i got done preaching one night
[1:32:20] i was walking i was walking out and he
[1:32:22] had the they had a camp a youth camp set
[1:32:24] up and so the audio was kind of in an
[1:32:26] odd place over on the on the side of the
[1:32:28] building and so i was walking out
[1:32:29] towards the back door
[1:32:31] and he and i see him coming i think oh
[1:32:32] he's going to ask me if i need a water
[1:32:34] or he's going to and as he gets closer
[1:32:35] to me i can see that he's
[1:32:37] he's affected by the presence that's in
[1:32:39] the room
[1:32:40] and he comes up to me and says i've got
[1:32:42] to have
[1:32:44] what you have
[1:32:45] i need that
[1:32:46] i've got to have it and here he's born
[1:32:48] and raised
[1:32:49] in a message church
[1:32:51] i've got to have that you think well if
[1:32:53] i go out in the world maybe i'll have a
[1:32:54] better testimony that's what happened to
[1:32:55] him and he came back in he still said
[1:32:57] i've got to have what you have
[1:33:02] friends the lord is still giving new
[1:33:03] births
[1:33:04] i watched one happen right there on the
[1:33:06] floor we didn't we didn't crawl through
[1:33:08] it or we didn't squeeze our way through
[1:33:10] it i simply said silver and gold have i
[1:33:12] none but that which i have i give unto
[1:33:15] you in the name of jesus and a wave of
[1:33:17] anointing came down and he is forever
[1:33:19] changed he just preached his first
[1:33:21] sermon last week
[1:33:23] you see what god's doing in this hour
[1:33:26] you're not just meant to hold on to
[1:33:27] whatever you're dealt the cards you're
[1:33:29] dealt with is not what you ended up with
[1:33:30] you can change your circumstance you can
[1:33:33] change your atmosphere around you by
[1:33:34] simply saying i've got to have something
[1:33:36] more than i currently have i've got to
[1:33:39] have something greater than just knowing
[1:33:41] god sent a prophet or knowing the quotes
[1:33:43] or knowing that our pastor is a good man
[1:33:45] i've got to know him i've got to know
[1:33:46] the author i've got to recognize him
[1:33:48] i've got to have him living in me
[1:33:51] that's where we've got to get to if
[1:33:53] we're ever going to overcome the devil
[1:33:54] in this age
[1:33:55] i believe we will
[1:33:57] i believe we are
[1:33:58] i believe it's by the bride that we're
[1:34:00] recognizing this is not yesterday's
[1:34:02] light
[1:34:04] but we're walking
[1:34:06] in a different maturity that's why i'm
[1:34:08] not preaching to you like your kids
[1:34:10] because you're walking in another level
[1:34:11] of maturity the 11th hour worker
[1:34:14] understands it at the same level
[1:34:17] is that all right
[1:34:18] the same pay we're not getting money
[1:34:20] here the 11th hour worker understands it
[1:34:23] at the same level as those that have
[1:34:25] been delving their life into it for for
[1:34:27] years and years and years but you give
[1:34:30] me you give me a nine-year-old that's
[1:34:32] been raised in a good message church and
[1:34:34] he'll out-preach any theologian out
[1:34:36] there in any denomination i heal out
[1:34:38] preacher joel osteen or a td jakes or
[1:34:41] whoever you give him
[1:34:44] a paul washer come on give me another
[1:34:46] name he'll out preach any one of those
[1:34:48] preachers because the authority that
[1:34:50] we've been given in this hour is a
[1:34:52] greater light than they could ever
[1:34:53] imagine to attain and yet we're the ones
[1:34:56] living under privileges
[1:35:00] friends i didn't just come out here to
[1:35:02] yell at you
[1:35:04] but i am sick and tired
[1:35:06] of watching the devil
[1:35:08] trample all over god's people to take
[1:35:11] victories away from god's people to to
[1:35:13] hand him a card that says you're
[1:35:15] depressed to hand him a card that says
[1:35:16] you're anxious to hand him a card that
[1:35:18] says you won't sleep tonight i refuse to
[1:35:20] accept that from the devil i say it's
[1:35:22] ours and it's time to kick him out
[1:35:25] kick him out of your life kick him out
[1:35:27] of your mind kick him out of your of
[1:35:28] your world your circumstance
[1:35:30] you have control over that now you might
[1:35:33] go home and you're maybe i don't know
[1:35:34] all of you maybe you live with
[1:35:35] unbelieving parents i don't know but you
[1:35:38] have the ability within you to have the
[1:35:40] faith to say i am the one he was talking
[1:35:43] about
[1:35:44] it's me
[1:35:45] it's for me
[1:35:46] this is my victory
[1:35:48] i'm not looking for something else to
[1:35:49] come but i'm walking in the victory now
[1:35:53] is that all right friends
[1:36:00] what are we waiting for

[1:36:16] you might not make it out of this
[1:36:17] building
[1:36:22] where the tim you didn't know you might
[1:36:24] not make it in mexico new mexico
[1:36:27] you just don't know
[1:36:30] you might not make it
[1:36:31] to the next surface
[1:36:33] you've got to settle things now
[1:36:37] you got to take him at his word now
[1:36:39] you got to recognize
[1:36:40] he's here now
[1:36:42] don't let that anointing go by
[1:36:44] without recognizing whose presence
[1:36:46] you're in
[1:36:49] jacob knew there was another israel
[1:36:50] there was an israel in him
[1:36:52] there's another me
[1:36:54] inside there
[1:36:56] i'm not just what you see out here just
[1:36:57] this common flesh and
[1:37:00] just look like any other person on the
[1:37:01] street but there's another you
[1:37:03] there's another you
[1:37:05] another you inside there
[1:37:06] and when jacob recognized the anointing
[1:37:08] was there
[1:37:09] i'll not let you go till you bless me
[1:37:12] i'll let the pot roast burn
[1:37:14] i'll let the beans boil i'll not let you
[1:37:16] go

[1:37:23] recognize who's in your midst
[1:37:25] recognize who what this word came to do
[1:37:27] in our hour
[1:37:29] recognize it wasn't just a man
[1:37:32] wore a suit just like you and i
[1:37:34] but it was a living christ
[1:37:36] my ministry is to declare
[1:37:38] that he's here
[1:37:40] and if he's here
[1:37:42] all things
[1:37:44] somebody say all things
[1:37:46] are possible
[1:37:47] he just wants you to put your faith in
[1:37:49] action to activate the promise
[1:37:52] is that all right
[1:37:54] the music players would come
[1:37:57] i don't know how long we've been up here

[1:38:08] the most confident
[1:38:10] the most on top of the world people that
[1:38:12] there is because we've been given a
[1:38:14] promise

[1:38:52] fighting

[1:49:02] you're the victory right he was
[1:49:04] victorious
[1:49:06] over the death hell engraving the cross
[1:49:08] but you and i are going to have to be
[1:49:09] what participants of that
[1:49:12] we're going to have to take that and
[1:49:14] like brother ronnie said we're going to
[1:49:15] have to live it he he doesn't know that
[1:49:17] our whole theme for this whole year has
[1:49:19] been what
[1:49:21] let it out
[1:49:23] good or bad whatever you got in let it
[1:49:25] out if it's good you need to let it out
[1:49:26] and show the world if it's bad you need
[1:49:27] to get it out right so here he comes and
[1:49:29] talk about kicking it out
[1:49:31] so we appreciate that man so he's just a
[1:49:33] little more stronger than i was a little
[1:49:35] bit you know kick it out but we need to
[1:49:37] kick your devil out amen and we ought to
[1:49:39] kick our heels up for jesus christ amen
[1:49:43] we're victorious
[1:49:45] this world has no victory
[1:49:48] none show me one
[1:49:50] tell me one thing this world can brag on
[1:49:52] well yeah they brag on being winning
[1:49:54] ball games and winning this temporary
[1:49:57] yeah
[1:49:58] eternal life is not temporary
[1:50:01] eternal life is eternal right and that's
[1:50:03] what we're talking about that's what
[1:50:04] brother ronnie was talking about today
[1:50:05] and uh really good let's give our
[1:50:07] brother a big hand
[1:50:08] hey man you believe what he said
[1:50:13] i'm like dad always says i believe he
[1:50:14] believes what he said anyway amen
[1:50:16] whether you do or not
[1:50:18] i believe he believes what he said we
[1:50:19] need to enter in um i was thinking about
[1:50:22] that i was laughing while you were
[1:50:23] preaching i preached a sermon 20 years
[1:50:25] ago on 10 lion preachers
[1:50:28] that's what it was
[1:50:29] there was 10 there was 10 there was 12
[1:50:31] went across
[1:50:32] 10 come back and they lied
[1:50:34] they were liars and they were preachers
[1:50:36] because they made the people like he
[1:50:37] said they made the people
[1:50:39] stay there for 40 years
[1:50:41] 10 people that said we are grasshoppers
[1:50:45] then there had to be a joshua generation
[1:50:47] like you saying the joshua generation
[1:50:49] had to raise up a young group of people
[1:50:51] amen to carry us on and but now remember
[1:50:54] i want to i want to make something clear
[1:50:56] joshua was young but caleb was an old
[1:50:58] guy
[1:51:00] us old people can do it too
[1:51:02] hey man
[1:51:03] caleb was 80 something years old okay
[1:51:05] all right and he said he was stronger
[1:51:07] now than he was 40 years ago how many of
[1:51:09] y'all can say that don't raise your hand
[1:51:11] you lie
[1:51:13] but you know what
[1:51:15] i believe caleb probably had aches and
[1:51:17] pains and and needed some
[1:51:19] liniment and geritol and everything else
[1:51:21] but you know what in his spirit
[1:51:23] he was just as young
[1:51:24] as he was because you know what he had a
[1:51:26] promise you and i have a promise
[1:51:28] we have a promise that this group as
[1:51:30] brother ronnie said this group is going
[1:51:32] to defeat the devil
[1:51:34] like i said many times before i'm just
[1:51:36] dumb enough to believe i'm going to do
[1:51:37] it
[1:51:38] i'm just dumb enough to put myself in a
[1:51:40] place to where god can speak to me
[1:51:43] and i can help god i don't god don't
[1:51:45] need any help but you know what he chose
[1:51:46] us he chose us to help him he chose us
[1:51:49] like i said we're his victory
[1:51:52] him dying on the cross and going to
[1:51:53] calvary and getting being resurrected
[1:51:56] has nothing to do
[1:51:59] if you're not doing it in you if it's
[1:52:00] not doing it inside of you
[1:52:02] we've got to what make manifest what
[1:52:04] he's already done
[1:52:05] amen you love the lord
[1:52:07] man thank you everybody for coming we're
[1:52:09] going to go downstairs and eat now the
[1:52:10] young kids eat first
[1:52:12] because this is a youth day so
[1:52:15] take them downstairs
[1:52:16] and
[1:52:18] two slices of pizza first

[1:52:24] afterwards but just make sure that we
