[0:04] um let's just go to the Lord in pray
[0:05] before we get into our study Lord we
[0:07] just ask Lord that you'll be with us
[0:08] today Lord God that you'll Lord just
[0:12] that that the atmosphere of the service
[0:14] and our hearts would be just set just
[0:15] right Lord to receive what you have in
[0:17] store for us today Lord and you will
[0:20] give us abundantly the things we have
[0:21] need of Lord we pray in your name
[0:24] amen so um before we get into the kind
[0:27] of the study I just wanted to this is
[0:29] kind of the theme of the what I've what
[0:31] I've been thinking on as I meditate on
[0:32] some of these scriptures this this quote
[0:35] where brother R said give him your
[0:37] best give him everything you got your
[0:40] life your soul your being your time all
[0:42] that you have give to him and I think I
[0:46] think that really you know in this day
[0:48] that we're living in it seems like the
[0:50] the devil robs you of of the time he's
[0:52] he's um trying to make you work as hard
[0:54] as you can and and before long
[0:57] everything just starts slipping away and
[0:58] you begin to forget what's what really
[1:00] important and you know this this day
[1:03] when we when we come together on Sundays
[1:06] this day is set aside during the week
[1:08] for us to really give everything we've
[1:09] got to the service and come expecting to
[1:11] receive something that uh it just kind
[1:13] of embodies what this quote means give
[1:15] him your best to come expecting to
[1:17] receive from God and come expecting to
[1:19] give everything I got come expecting to
[1:22] to to set my mind in my thoughts and
[1:24] everything in order to receive for what
[1:26] God has for us cuz we're not coming to
[1:29] hear from man or anything like that but
[1:31] we're coming to hear from the word of
[1:32] God and Christ is the word so that's why
[1:35] in Hebrews 13:7 it says remember them
[1:38] which have the rule over you who have
[1:39] spoken unto you the word of God whose
[1:42] Faith follow considering the end of
[1:45] their
[1:46] conversation and we kind of went through
[1:48] kind of a little study on the fivefold
[1:50] ministry but you know in line with that
[1:51] that thought of giving your best you
[1:54] know kind of think think about that as
[1:56] we kind of study these things out
[1:57] because I wanted to I wanted to kind of
[1:58] talk about how
[2:00] God has given us his best in the in the
[2:02] fivefold ministry he's given and of that
[2:04] he requires that the five-fold ministry
[2:07] give them give their best and they're
[2:09] giving their best and so then he
[2:11] requires you to give your best the
[2:13] fivefold ministry and so let's look at
[2:15] what the the requirements of the fold
[2:17] ministry as we meditating on those
[2:18] thoughts that that they're giving their
[2:20] best to live a life separated from the
[2:22] world to give everything they've got and
[2:24] then that God expects us in turn to give
[2:27] our best because we're remember them
[2:29] which have the rule over you and as we
[2:31] we study this out it's not the men that
[2:32] have rule over us but it's the word
[2:35] that's claiming Our Lives the word that
[2:36] they're preaching the word that they're
[2:39] representing like in the in the New
[2:41] Testament that scripture that says that
[2:43] that when you speak speak as of the
[2:44] Oracles of God that you're actually
[2:46] speaking as a representation of the word
[2:49] that's coming straight from the Throne
[2:51] of of God so brother Ram said and and
[2:53] how in in several quotes he said how do
[2:56] I know if I'm called to preach he said I
[2:58] watch the nature of the person and see
[3:00] what kind of a gift they're professing
[3:02] cuz the nature of that person will slot
[3:04] them right into where they're supposed
[3:05] to go and he said your position is
[3:06] usually known whether you can do it or
[3:08] not of course there's a lot summed up in
[3:10] that it doesn't mean just you can get up
[3:12] behind the pulpit and and and not pass
[3:14] out from from fear or whatever but it
[3:16] means that you can actually be
[3:17] profitable in your in your life and your
[3:20] and and you can actually speed something
[3:22] that will help speak by Revelation
[3:23] something that will help somebody um
[3:25] pull them out of their predicament of
[3:27] sin and and and and begin to change
[3:29] their life and be effectual on them so
[3:32] we're again we're talking about we're
[3:33] going to give our best so brother R said
[3:36] or or Paul actually laid out these
[3:38] requirements for a minister that I've
[3:40] just kind of summed up here and I'm just
[3:41] going to skim through them that a
[3:43] Minister's got to be above reproach and
[3:45] as we as we as we look through these
[3:47] requirements I want to kind of frame it
[3:48] up with something brother brother Dale
[3:50] actually told me years ago that you
[3:52] actually grow into your
[3:54] ministry the same way the same way that
[3:57] you grow as a newborn believer you start
[3:59] out with some there's some fuzzy spots
[4:01] in your life that you grow into
[4:03] immaturity the same thing with the
[4:05] minister there might be some fuzzy spots
[4:07] where maybe maybe your marriage ain't
[4:09] quite the way it needs to be maybe your
[4:10] life ain't quite or or the your your
[4:13] children aren't behaving the right thing
[4:14] but things maybe one day just something
[4:17] something really nails down okay if I'm
[4:18] going to preach this gospel we're going
[4:20] to straighten things up and so you grow
[4:22] into it and so let's not just boot
[4:25] somebody out because maybe they don't
[4:26] live exactly the way that we think they
[4:28] do but on the other hand a minister
[4:30] we're we're we're supposed to be
[4:31] striving striving for excellence and why
[4:34] are all these requirements here because
[4:36] because people are looking at us so Paul
[4:40] Paul laid out these requirements to
[4:41] Timothy he said you got to be above
[4:43] reproach above reproach faithful in
[4:46] marriage temperate self-controlled
[4:48] respectable hospitable and above all I
[4:52] I'll say above all able to teach cuz if
[4:54] you can't proclaim the word then that
[4:56] kind of defeats the whole purpose of
[4:58] preaching and he'd say not given to
[5:00] drunkenness or violence gentle and
[5:02] Peaceable not a lover of money uh is
[5:05] that isn't that true that we're not here
[5:06] for money I was reading out brother Bram
[5:08] said that uh brother brandham John
[5:10] Wesley gave 90% of everything he got to
[5:12] his ties brother brandham gave 90% I
[5:15] found a quote where he said he gave 90%
[5:17] another place brother Adam said I I want
[5:18] to live as poor as the people I'm
[5:20] preaching to so it wasn't about
[5:23] money you're not a lover of money when
[5:25] you when you do this and I I I meditate
[5:27] sometimes on the fact that I really
[5:29] don't know how traveling preachers that
[5:30] do it full-time can subsist on on the
[5:33] money I don't know how it even works
[5:35] because it's not you you're not you you
[5:38] you start preaching this gospel you're
[5:40] not going to you're not going to get
[5:41] money much less
[5:44] anyway managing your family well not a
[5:46] recent convert and good reputation
[5:49] outside of the church but now brother
[5:50] Bram said I can he said we we think
[5:52] about all the best class but I just want
[5:54] to sum it up what's the requirement to
[5:56] be able to preach the gospel we we just
[5:58] think about all the best best class a
[6:00] minister must be a student he must be
[6:01] this that or the other to me he must be
[6:04] the Bible requirement he's got to be
[6:06] filled with the Holy Ghost that's the
[6:09] main
[6:10] thing and Jehovah Gyra brother said I
[6:13] don't care if you don't know his ABCs or
[6:15] split peas from coffee let me tell you
[6:18] brother as long as he knows Jesus Christ
[6:20] he may talk through his nose and holler
[6:21] hit and hate but as long as he's got god
[6:24] with him something will happen in your
[6:26] church I'll tell you that I'd rather
[6:28] have that than all the phds and
[6:30] everything else that's psychology I want
[6:32] to know God and the power of his
[6:34] resurrection so there's the requirement
[6:37] for a minister to have known God in the
[6:39] power of his resurrection and then
[6:40] despite all maybe the lackings and
[6:42] things of his his education and all that
[6:44] kind of background but yet he knows God
[6:46] and he's able to to to Proclaim it in a
[6:48] in in the
[6:50] power so remember them which have the
[6:52] rule over you I I I was reading uh we
[6:55] were uh my wife and I were listening to
[6:57] straight As the gate the other day and
[6:59] and uh if you really want to listen to a
[7:02] good scaling sermon that is a good
[7:05] sermon to listen
[7:06] to to maybe maybe kind of set in your
[7:09] mind that maybe sometimes the preachers
[7:11] in Church are a little bit hard but oh
[7:14] go back and listen to what brother
[7:15] random said he he was a little bit rough
[7:18] sometimes but he said I know you think
[7:20] I'm a hard guy I'm not hard I'm your
[7:23] brother and I love you flee the Wrath
[7:26] that is to come go to the cross and cry
[7:29] until your heart is filled with his
[7:31] Spirit that'll turn you back from
[7:32] everything of the world and walk Godly
[7:34] before him with your heart burning for
[7:36] him love not a duty Christ is not a duty
[7:40] to serve Christ it's a love that serves
[7:44] Christ it strains you constrains you
[7:46] till every pulsation of your life beats
[7:50] with him now that's that's really giving
[7:52] your best where you're ready to
[7:53] surrender everything to him ready to
[7:56] give up your life and you're ready to
[7:58] come to church ready to re receive
[8:00] you're you're not looking at it is just
[8:01] another mundane application see we we so
[8:04] many times we think of church as just
[8:06] another mundane thing just another thing
[8:08] we're but all we're coming to give our
[8:11] best to Christ if you're a priest if
[8:13] you're called to be a priest you're
[8:14] called to give sacrifices sacrifices of
[8:17] your time sacrifice where you you've set
[8:19] aside that time on Sunday where maybe
[8:21] the night before you hadn't stayed up
[8:23] all night because you've set aside
[8:25] knowing that you're coming to church
[8:26] expecting to get something so many times
[8:29] that they the devil will get us on a
[8:30] spot where I got to stay up late on
[8:32] Sunday night to fulfill this obligation
[8:34] to my family or my job or something and
[8:36] we just forget that the main thing the
[8:38] main thing is Christ we're coming here
[8:41] expecting remember them which have the
[8:43] rule over you just keep keeping in that
[8:45] same line of thought brother Ram said in
[8:47] straight is the gate he said God wake us
[8:49] all up this morning Shake us Lord we see
[8:53] the signs appearing we got our eyes open
[8:55] to know that we see millions millions
[8:58] Lord that's turn turn their back and
[8:59] going away I wonder what can I do what
[9:01] can I do oh Lord is there anything Lord
[9:04] if it takes more preaching more prayer
[9:06] more anything help me Lord that I might
[9:09] bring the message to the people what can
[9:11] I do but they continually turn it down
[9:14] you do your Great Signs and perform your
[9:16] wonders and yet the People March right
[9:18] on now you you think about what he's
[9:21] saying there that God poured out all of
[9:22] these signs and wonders and yet people
[9:24] still don't want it he does so many
[9:26] things right there in the midst of the
[9:28] church people's lives being changed
[9:30] people Miracles and signs and wonders
[9:32] doing on every hand that maybe you don't
[9:34] see right right out in the open but
[9:35] they're being done nevertheless and
[9:37] people don't want it and it begin to get
[9:39] M they well I'm just going to stay home
[9:40] from church on Sunday I'm this Sunday
[9:43] I'm uh uh uh like I was telling brother
[9:46] Wade I was uh at at at another church uh
[9:50] um there was a brother saying well you
[9:53] know I thought I thought since it was
[9:54] the last day of the of the month I'm
[9:56] just going to stay home from church
[9:57] today and so you get get you get those
[9:59] thoughts in your mind because it's not
[10:01] it's not the main thing for you that
[10:03] Christ is not the main thing and you
[10:05] come to church expecting to just well
[10:06] I'm just going to come to church and
[10:08] just got not give my all all to it I'm
[10:10] not going to give everything I'm not
[10:11] going to give all that I am to it and
[10:14] you begin to get expect the
[10:17] mundane brother random said in thot
[10:19] titer in church age he said it's the
[10:21] word that rules us not men as a man as a
[10:24] husband is head of the woman he rules
[10:26] her but the church is a woman too and
[10:28] her rules is the word Jesus is the word
[10:31] so that means that Jesus is the main
[10:34] thing not the man behind the pulpit not
[10:36] the deacons or the trustees not even my
[10:39] own preaching or anything like that but
[10:41] it's all about Jesus you know that's
[10:44] where the denomination World got mixed
[10:46] up with they thought that brother
[10:47] brandham should be the kind of man that
[10:49] would come on the scene and he'd prop up
[10:50] Billy Graham or he'd prop up or robbers
[10:53] and kind of support them but he didn't
[10:54] come to support no man he come to
[10:56] support Jesus Christ and point us toes
[10:59] Jesus Christ it's all about him and
[11:00] that's why this day of the week is set
[11:03] aside so we can come to church with our
[11:04] eyes wide open with our hearts open to
[11:07] receive from Christ cuz he's the main
[11:09] thing it's all about him I I I began to
[11:12] look at that message Pride that was
[11:14] preached up there in campbellville
[11:15] Kentucky this is where I go to preach
[11:17] when I'm going to Kentucky it's
[11:19] interesting that this sermon was
[11:20] preached there where where he talks
[11:22] about how that people would not give
[11:25] will put Jesus over in the corner and
[11:28] not pay him no money
[11:29] and he was he's setting in our mind that
[11:31] that's not what church is supposed to be
[11:32] about it's supposed to be where you you
[11:34] come awake and ready to receive from God
[11:37] and do like that little woman that that
[11:39] uh was ready to entertain him entertain
[11:42] Jesus he said the Pharisee was too busy
[11:45] he was meeting the doctors and the
[11:47] fairis celebrities he had too much to do
[11:48] to see Jesus come in listen I wonder if
[11:51] that isn't the case today if we're not
[11:53] too busy with our profession and other
[11:56] things and we fail to entertain him now
[11:59] that's what keeps us from doing our best
[12:02] I think even in my own job my my job is
[12:05] just just throwing this out there is a
[12:06] very stressful job and I go Full Tilt
[12:09] from about 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 and then
[12:12] then I just I get off the phone after
[12:13] being in meetings nonstop all day long
[12:15] and I just I just I got to take a little
[12:18] break but you see that's a lot of times
[12:20] that the devil will give you will get
[12:21] you in that trap where you just are
[12:23] going Full Tilt for your job and after
[12:26] after you get off work you're still
[12:27] working and you're working you rise up
[12:29] early in the morning to get a head start
[12:30] on the day and you work and you work and
[12:32] you work you know the number two reason
[12:35] that people on their deathbed say that
[12:36] the number two um uh thing thing that
[12:40] people wish they had done different in
[12:42] their life was not work so hard and
[12:44] that's what the devil will do is is
[12:46] he'll get you working so hard until
[12:48] you're giving your whole life to that
[12:50] instead of to God and you're not giving
[12:52] you're not giving your best to God
[12:54] you're giving your best to your employer
[12:56] I I used to work with this this guy that
[12:58] U that he passed away and uh probably
[13:01] two weeks before he passed away he sent
[13:03] an email around to everybody I'm trying
[13:05] to respond he was on his death bed I'm
[13:07] trying to respond to the to the project
[13:10] request I'm trying to do my very best to
[13:12] respond and I was thinking Lord if if I
[13:15] was ever on my deathbed don't let the
[13:16] last thing I do say I I I don't want
[13:20] people to say well he always responded
[13:21] to his emails I want people to respond I
[13:24] want people to know what I did for
[13:26] Christ what you do for Christ is all
[13:28] that matters and what you're doing right
[13:30] here in church this morning with your
[13:32] eyes wide open not willing to waste a
[13:34] day by falling asleep but why because
[13:37] you're coming with your best intention
[13:39] you're giving your best not expecting
[13:41] the day to just be some kind of a
[13:42] mundane thing where you just here we go
[13:45] to Sunday again no here we come to hear
[13:47] the word of God and let the word have a
[13:49] rule over us now brother Brown said in
[13:52] the message Pride he said my Lord's in
[13:54] town my Lord's in town won't you
[13:56] entertain him in your heart and that's
[13:58] what we failed understand that when we
[13:59] come to church that Christ is in the
[14:02] building God is in the building so when
[14:04] you come to church with the expectation
[14:06] that I'm going to get something from God
[14:08] whatever you have need of if you need a
[14:10] greater refilling then God is in the
[14:12] building to give it to you if you want
[14:14] it you can have it he said Hallelujah
[14:17] somebody's going to entertain him
[14:18] somebody is going to come to him and I
[14:21] want that to be said about me I want
[14:23] that to be said about me with my
[14:24] Ministry that I've given everything I
[14:26] can to study and lay and labor and and
[14:29] do and travel and whatever I can where
[14:32] God wants me to go and the same thing
[14:34] for you when the when somebody has
[14:35] studied and laid before the Lord and
[14:37] prayed and given their all to bring a
[14:39] message to you it's your obligation to
[14:41] give everything that you have to receive
[14:43] that word and nothing less is acceptable
[14:46] to
[14:47] God and in the message Pride he said now
[14:50] such a little place perhaps sitting over
[14:52] in the corner Pharisee was too busy he
[14:54] had he had to do other things the
[14:56] celebrity the big people of the town was
[14:58] there there and he had to entertain them
[15:00] I wonder Brethren and sisters if we
[15:02] haven't put so much time to entertaining
[15:04] celebrities and dignitaries that we
[15:06] forgot that Jesus sits in the midst of
[15:08] us two sitting over in the corner nobody
[15:11] noticing him sitting alone his disciples
[15:15] couldn't come in they wasn't even
[15:19] invited and I I think about that message
[15:21] and behold I stand at the door of the
[15:23] knock he said' what if the Queen of
[15:24] England now the Queen of England's
[15:26] passed on so I got a little picture of
[15:27] the king of england' what if the Queen
[15:29] of England that just recently visited
[15:31] the United States what if she would have
[15:33] come to Greenville and found the most
[15:35] Humble Home that there is in Greenville
[15:37] and knocked on the door and it would
[15:38] have been your home and you'd went to
[15:40] the door and seen that was the Queen of
[15:42] England it would have been an honor for
[15:43] you to entertain the Queen of England
[15:45] certainly you would have said oh Queen
[15:47] come into my house and if there is
[15:49] anything in here that you desire you can
[15:51] have it if You' had a little trinket
[15:53] that your mother gave you or some good
[15:55] friend gave you and you cherished it
[15:56] very high yet the queen was would say I
[15:59] would like to have that you give it to
[16:01] her because it would be an honor for you
[16:02] to give it to her because she's an
[16:04] important person what he saying
[16:06] something that your mama passed down to
[16:08] you that you held on to that was very
[16:10] cherished but if the queen asked you for
[16:11] it you'd give it but yeah we're so
[16:14] unwilling to give the things that we has
[16:16] hold most precious to Christ and I got
[16:18] this picture here of the king with a
[16:20] platter full of food carrying it out on
[16:22] a silver platter and yet this man's here
[16:24] laying asleep not not because he's not
[16:27] interested he's not interested in what
[16:29] the king's bringing to him oh and you
[16:31] think so many times we come to church
[16:33] and we're not willing to open up our
[16:34] heart and and actually just listen to
[16:36] the word that we'd rather lay our head
[16:38] up against the wall or because we have
[16:41] we've let our work in our life consume
[16:44] us we didn't get enough sleep the last
[16:45] night because we were up until 2:00 the
[16:47] last morning somewhere where we
[16:49] shouldn't even be as a Christian and
[16:50] then we come into the house of God and
[16:52] we won't listen to the word of God
[16:54] because it's not the main thing the main
[16:56] thing in our life is Christ and that's
[16:58] what it's all
[17:00] about Matthew 6: 21 says lay up not lay
[17:04] up not for yourselves Treasures upon
[17:06] Earth where moth and rust do corrupt and
[17:09] where thieves break through and steal
[17:11] but lay up for yourselves Treasures in
[17:13] Heaven where neither moth nor rust death
[17:15] corrupt and where thieves do not break
[17:17] through nor steal for where your
[17:19] treasure is there will your heart be
[17:21] also and I got a little picture here of
[17:23] a little family that gathered around
[17:24] watching the football game and they're
[17:26] real excited about that game and you
[17:28] know people that's how people do they
[17:29] can watch some kind of show for two or
[17:32] three hours but put them in church and
[17:33] let the devil start setting that
[17:35] atmosphere of unbelief and they'll go
[17:38] right off to sleep because why it's a
[17:40] spiritual thing it's not something where
[17:42] the preacher getting upset at you
[17:44] because that you don't you don't listen
[17:45] to him while he's up oh it's my favorite
[17:48] thing to preach and I want you to listen
[17:49] to me but it's a spiritual thing when
[17:51] it's not your main thing it's not your
[17:53] main desire it's not The Treasure of
[17:55] your heart and because it's not your
[17:57] treasure you you'd rather watch some
[17:59] game or some nonsense football game than
[18:01] than come to church and listen to the
[18:03] word of God being preached over the
[18:05] pulpit and then you'll get upset because
[18:07] a minister tells you the truth just like
[18:09] the fulfilling the scripture why will
[18:11] you hate me because I tell you the truth
[18:13] will you send me your text and tell
[18:15] every why why are you telling me all
[18:16] these things because I'm telling you the
[18:18] truth where is the love of God in your
[18:20] heart what is your main thing where is
[18:22] your focus in your life do you come to
[18:25] church because you love God or because
[18:26] you just you're fulfilling your
[18:28] obligation and you're going through the
[18:30] same mundane ritual week after week it's
[18:33] supposed to be a love affair God wants
[18:35] to get a hold of your heart and draw you
[18:36] to him he wants you to love him from
[18:38] your heart and not love him because
[18:40] somebody told you to do it that's right
[18:43] that's right you you think of somebody
[18:46] at a football game it would be an odd
[18:48] thing for them to tilt their head back
[18:49] and have their mouth a gate where a fly
[18:51] could go in and out of it it would be an
[18:53] odd thing to be for them to be tilting
[18:54] their head back on the on the on the
[18:56] chair at their football everybody around
[18:58] them will be they got all their all
[19:00] their beer and all the things that you
[19:02] do in a football game and they would
[19:04] think well this is it's an odd thing to
[19:06] see somebody not entering into the
[19:08] atmosphere and it's an odd thing for
[19:10] somebody in church that's not entering
[19:11] into the pattern of the word the rhythm
[19:13] of the rhythm of the speaker entering
[19:15] into the atmosphere of the church and
[19:17] and come expecting to receive and to
[19:19] believe something it's just as odd for
[19:21] somebody in church to tilt their head
[19:23] back and sleep that it would be for
[19:25] somebody at a football game to tilt
[19:26] their head back and just snow through
[19:28] the whole thing not listening and at the
[19:30] end of the game well who won who won oh
[19:33] oh don't let that be my Christian
[19:35] experience I want to know what's
[19:37] happening in
[19:41] church and it would be an odd thing too
[19:44] for you to go over to somebody's house
[19:45] I've had many people at my home and they
[19:47] come and and they sit down and we'll
[19:49] talk and we'll fellowship with thing
[19:51] Fellowship over the table and not one
[19:54] one time has anybody ever fell asleep in
[19:56] my home as we're entertaining one
[19:58] another over over the supper table we
[20:00] sit and we fellowship and we talk what a
[20:03] strange thing that would be if I was
[20:04] entertaining somebody like in this
[20:06] picture and their their head would begin
[20:08] to droop as I was maybe would you would
[20:11] you like some of this nice food that my
[20:13] wife is prepared for you you see that's
[20:15] what we're doing when we come to church
[20:17] that the word of God has been labored
[20:19] and prepared and studied over and it's
[20:21] being handed to you on a silver platter
[20:23] what a strange thing it would be for you
[20:25] to say well I'm not interested in that
[20:29] you see it's a heart problem when you're
[20:30] not interested in it it shows that
[20:33] there's something
[20:34] wrong there's something wrong if you
[20:36] don't understand there's something wrong
[20:38] if your heart's not there there's
[20:39] something wrong if you don't come
[20:40] prepared to receive the word of
[20:44] God give him your best in Mark 12:30 it
[20:48] says and you shall love the Lord your
[20:49] God with all your heart with just part
[20:52] of my heart just uh Monday through
[20:55] Friday I'm going to give my heart to the
[20:57] world and my job and my boss and Sunday
[21:01] because I'm so tired I I've given I've
[21:03] already given it all I've already given
[21:05] it all over there the first part of the
[21:07] week and Sunday I I just got a little
[21:09] bit left so I can't give it all you
[21:13] shall love the Lord your God with all
[21:14] your heart and with all your soul and
[21:16] with all your mind and with all your
[21:17] strength and that trickles over Beyond
[21:19] even Sunday You're supposed to be you're
[21:21] supposed to have a steady sturdy prayer
[21:23] life and want to read the Bible and want
[21:26] to serve God with all in you and want to
[21:29] sit around the table with your children
[21:32] and teach them the word of God and give
[21:34] everything that you've got give your
[21:36] best your best is what God requires and
[21:39] Colossians chapter 323 to 24 it says
[21:41] whatever you do work at it with all your
[21:43] heart as working for the Lord not for
[21:46] human Master since you know that you
[21:47] will receive an inheritance from the
[21:49] Lord as a reward it is the Lord Christ
[21:52] you are serving well if I say Amen too
[21:55] much that'll it might Pump Up The
[21:56] Minister's head I I if I if I get a
[21:59] church on time then they'll think I
[22:00] really want to be there but see it's
[22:03] Christ that we're serving Christ that's
[22:05] the reason we're here it's not to serve
[22:07] one another it's Christ 1 Corinthians
[22:10] 10:31 says so whether you eat or drink
[22:12] or whatever you do whatever you do do it
[22:15] all for the glory of the Lord I want to
[22:17] go full til and whatever whatever go I'm
[22:20] doing he's worthy of the best brother
[22:22] Ram said and the unwelcomed Christ what
[22:24] do you do for him give him the leftover
[22:27] oh yeah you run around all day and give
[22:30] him 3 minutes at night before you go to
[22:32] bed he deserves your best friend he
[22:35] deserves everything you got but what do
[22:38] you do about it you give him just
[22:41] anything he takes it he takes it anyhow
[22:44] he'll take it if you only wait for 5
[22:46] minutes in the service he'll take it if
[22:48] your heart's only halfway there he'll
[22:50] take it but he wants your best he wants
[22:53] your best and I think he deserves your
[22:55] best he deserves your very best
[22:58] absolutely and I you know when darl Ward
[23:01] was here a while back he talked us tell
[23:03] us about how the University of Tennessee
[23:05] football team when they go through that
[23:06] door they put their hand up to slap it
[23:10] that sign that says I will give my all
[23:11] for Tennessee today and because of that
[23:14] we put that sign on the door back there
[23:16] above the brother Joe M printed that
[23:19] thing out so you can you can actually
[23:20] read it when you're coming in maybe you
[23:21] hadn't looked at it in a while but it
[23:23] says this day I give my best for Christ
[23:25] or something that that effect oh so when
[23:28] we pass under that wall that when they
[23:30] pass under that sign they're they're
[23:31] putting their hand up there to signify
[23:33] that I'm going to do my best and when we
[23:35] come when we pass under that door under
[23:37] that sign over the door oh we should we
[23:39] should have that same kind of reaction
[23:41] that I'm coming to church to give my
[23:42] best Christ gave his best for me these
[23:45] ministers are giving their best for me
[23:47] I'm going to give my best to them
[23:48] because that's what Christ deserves he
[23:50] deserves our best and we'll stop on that
[23:53] God bless you
[23:56] amen
[24:00] than you
[24:04] amen
