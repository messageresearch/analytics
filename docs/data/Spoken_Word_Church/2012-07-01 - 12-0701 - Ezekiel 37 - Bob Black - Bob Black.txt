========================================

hey we need one of those little things like this hey we need one of those little director things all right all right good morning everybody good morning good morning M morning teacher how are you I'm doing one doing well all right you need to speak up for the F all right um so last time we went through um the sins of R jeroboam and the history of the Israel church and talking a little bit about the birthright now this time we're going to jump over to Ezekiel 37 um but before I get into that going to do a little background which I kind of Drew on the board a little bit up here um to talk about the seven Church ages in the Old Testament the seven Church in the New Testament how that um the the spirit that was in the palor locus Kor caterpillar away the word in the Old Testament and the New Testament and then in Ezekiel 37 it talks about the four um the four stages of the of the church coming forth through Luther Wesley Pentecost and then the word being restored so um just to read a few quotes about I think about jeroboam how it started at Solomon everything the golden age uh everything's wonderful they have time to read and study the word and Worship the Lord and then uh idolatry comes in the picture and remember idolatry is spiritual adultery getting away from the full unadulterated word of God uh one word off will put you into spiritual adultery and then uh the the spirit of the devil ate away down until remember Elijah when at the time of Ahab brother said Ahab was the dark ages of the Old Testament Elijah said is there anybody left that still believes God and it looked like it was nobody else that s stood with him um but it was not just a few but 7,000 it seems like um that's that's actually a pretty big number 7,000 um so it it it may seem at times like there's nobody else preaching the word and believing but that God has his his little few little few flock so in the invasion of the United States in 1954 brother Rand said many times someone has said brother random why is it you always take the Old Testament and we talked uh a long while ago about dispensationalism dispensationalism is the the kind of part of that is that you can understand the New Testament from the old test that God reveals himself through scripture you can look at the things in the Old Testament you can look at the the Tabernacle in the wilderness and understand the new birth going through the outer core the in core the holy of holies and the three pools and you can understand um what happens in the New Testament by looking at what happened in the Old Testament as they went through the Dark Ages nearly always taking a TT you go back to the Old Testament I do it because I like typology and he said in the Old Testament if the Lord willing make in the coming Services I'd like to show how that the seven Church ages typed out in the Old Testament how that they began just exactly like at the beginning of the church ages of the Gentile church and went right down through a similar Dark Age and come out into the Glorious time of Pentecost the following of the holy spirit in the early Church of the in the Jewish dispensation then going through another period of the Gentile Church through a Dark Age and then coming out again into the Millennium at the end and in separation from unbelief he said if you notice King Solomon in the day of Solomon Israel was at its bright briest turning then the king of Ahab time of King Ahab it was at its darkest just at the dark time of Israel where Ahab married a little old Idol worshipper and brought idolatry into Jewish religion so did the Holy Ghost Church marrying into the world and bringing idolatry in the Dark Ages very beautiful type on both churches and God keeps his word he said there was King Ahab of the Old Testament which king Ahab in his time is a beautiful type of the New Testament and notice just as Ahab married Jezebel and idolatry and brought idolatry into Egypt was a TI and the seven dispensations of the Old Testament as the seven candlesticks of the New Testament and the Dark Ages the 1500 years of Dark Ages protestantism married romanism and brought idolatry into the church just the same way watch the Bible and see if it doesn't say that that's right through that 1500 years of Dark Ages you come out with a false baptism sprinkling the false name false everything else and God said you have a little light and you have a name but you denied mine and I I read somewhere that the reason the the seven candlesticks type the the middle types the Dark Ages because in that Temple that when you went to light the middle ones they were further up it was still the same Holy Ghost it's still the same God in his church but the light was further up so down on the ground it was it was a little bit dark so that just a a type of God is still in his church but um the word had been eaten away we'll look at that in a second and in the darkest AG Elijah thought that there were no other believers and now at First Kings 19 he said I I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts because the children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant throwing down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life take it away when all hope looked gone looked like it was no hope at at all and we we'll see in Ezekiel 37 all Ezekiel saws Dry Bones it look like there's how how is anything good going to come out of what looks like death and but God Made A Way and then at the end of both Church ages he Elijah came Elijah John the Baptist to restore the Israelite fathers to the to turn the heart of the Israelite fathers to the children and at the end to turn the the children back to the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers see so now let's look at kind of kind of run through um I'm just do a quick overview of Joel's um and Joel one and we're all familiar with this scripture that which the Palmer worm has left at the Locust eaten and that which the Locust at left left ha the cankerworm eaten and that which the can worm ha left ha the caterpillar eaten and brother venam in Palmer Locus cat cankerworm caterpillar in 1953 he said during this time of Joel's prophecy here the church was in a terrible condition backslid just prior the coming of the Lord the first time and how did the Spirit come upon this prophet and he foresaw things and he saw the condition of the Jews and he saw the condition of the church in this day so it's the condition of the Jews and the condition of the church in the second seal 1963 he said that that wasn't done that wasn't what done it the first thing that's done the whole thing was that she turned from the word she turned from the word and the first thing started the prostitution in the Church of the Living God Christ bride she turned from the word and accepted Roman Dogma instead of God's word what's happened to every organization that's did the very same thing and then it started growing again through Luther Wesley Pentecost the word and these were all works of the spirit just like Ezekiel um the the Holy Spirit uh performing the four step the four stages you can't say that Luther wasn't uh wasn't a work of the Holy Spirit or Wesley it was all a work of the Holy Spirit the resume of the ages he said be uh he was reading Joel chapter 2 be in you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former rain moderately and he caus you to come down for you the rain the former rain the latter rain and then he continues on he says now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran age did not restore the church it started a Reformation the wesling age did not restore the Pentecostal W did not restore but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost till the beginning now notice in verse 2 it tells why we need restoration the Locust cankerworm caterpillar and palm worm have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem now we are told that all these insects are all one and the same in different stages that is right they are the Antichrist spirit manifested in organization denomination and false Doctrine Through the Ages and that poor little root and stalk is going to be restored God isn't going to plant a new church but is going to bring his original planting back to Original Seed he's doing it as state in verse 23 by the teaching of former rain next will come the Harvest rain or Rapture in faith so I have just a little summary of of the all all the different sermons that brother man preached from 1953 on about the the four stages palom the palor he said what did that eat away it ate away the um the nine spiritual gifts and he went through it in his sermon he said I got a whole page of what the um the palore made but it start the the the one thing that he always Associates with the Palmer worm was brotherly love and then it also ate faith in God's word CU if you the pomor meats away you don't know what's what um he ate he eat away he ate away the fruit of joy and your peace of mind knowing that you're saved and the restoration of the Bride free 1962 they said now let's picture a big tree of God's tree is bearing nine spiritual gifts they're Healing The Sick they're speaking in tongues they're casting out Devils they're doing great works and preaching the unadulterated word of God no denomination to tie them down they're free doing a great work so I think about this right here and right here the starting point everything's wonderful right here in Acts the spirit is completely being manifested the signs and wonders among the people so in come this little old devil setting up with his his two horns sitting out in front like a grasshopper you know and his little old greedy teeth that's his first the Palmer worm he come in to eat off brotherly love he said you know so and so did so and so over so and so's church I wouldn't believe that bunch of people see there he is first thing and we're all I I think the lack of Brotherly Love is what gives us all scars we've heard you know people along l Road people say hurtful things and um you know you say well so and so shouldn't be offended if I don't shake their hand but it's not their fault if they're offended you go ahead and Shake everybody's hand and make everybody feel really welcome because the sign in the you like that the sign in the early church was that Believers loved one another that was the evidence of what what a Christian was was love among the people in our excuse me all right our store 1957 he said if we need fences to build it ought to be denominational fences it ought to be love fences to keep the insect out to keep the pal worm out for he is the devil's number one Destroyer yeah yep and you know um we like we like to make fences I was thinking about all the the time somebody will uh associate uh just different things about what church you go to and uh different things about your character or whatever and they draw a little fence around you and put you in a category but he said don't don't do that draw your make your fence bigger and because that's the sign kind of a a real believing church he said this Jesus said this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for the other that's right Pentecost had that I speaking Pentecost meaning the first group of the Apostles and the disciples they had that Brotherly Love they wasn't griev they sold everything they had for the furthering of the church they were so together till even one word the other one till one when till even when one heard the other one died they said let us go and die with you such a feeling now Jesus spoke of this and said that Paul did rather and said let Brotherly Love continue that was in the first church was something taking place and there was a fell come in the name of a pmer worm and when he began to eat on that vine of Brotherly Love he cut the very sapl line of it because it don't make any difference how smart we are how much we think we know or how much we want want to be different from somebody else as long as that brotherly feeling isn't among us we are fighting a losing battle that's right we can't win there's no way for us to win and the next one so the Palm worm took away brotherly love and the ne the Locust took away I kind of think of these two as um brother Way's going to start going through the seals the the Antichrist Peri this saing one out the doctrine and the and the and then Crown the Locust took away the leaves palor took away the fruit which is brotherly love the fruits of the spirit the Locust took away leaves Divine Fellowship which is knowing having a relationship with God you remember the story we all know the story of Billy Paul went out heard his his dad praying in that room and calling out Papa God we think well wow brother BR had such a relationship but what about me what about my relationship with God I'm supposed to know that I know that I'm saved and the restoration of the brid tree 1962 he said what is fellowship what does the leaves do makes it cool where the birds fly and under the leaves cool off there's your tree again and he shall be like a tree that's planted seed all right where people can come and sit down under the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit cool off a little bit you're all flustrated and don't know what's happening and whether you die whether you're shaved or not you don't know whether this church is right or that's right just come down under the tree that's got some leaves on it sit down there let the winds from Heaven go to blow like a Russian Mighty Man through the leaves you know begins and he begin to cool off a little bit so this is General down through the church he's eating away but it's also in each individual's life got to make make sure that the devil doesn't need a way it's your fellowship with God to know that you know and the canker worm ate away at the bark which is you covering your religion your Doctrine and our religion is the blood the life in the blood that covers the word the Kangle worm took away the baptism of the Holy Ghost because if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't know where you are you can't understand the word and the restoration of the brid tree so then that same group of men sent a lady down said brother renom if the angel of the Lord told you the angel of the Lord you know his picture is there you see if the angel of the Lord told you that well will believe it I said anybody that a ministerial group that would be that weak if the angel of the Lord said if that angel said something contrary to this word it wouldn't be the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord will vindicate the word that's exactly what what he's always done through every age he still does the same thing he stays with the word and any Minister Anointed with the Holy Ghost will stay by the same word because the Bible said that the entire Bible was wrote by the Holy Ghost and how can you have the Holy Ghost and deny what the Bible says the very spirit in you it Bears record that is not from God see the korm has been eaten that's all eating away the true things of God yes sir unauthoritative word is contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles oh my what's unauthoritative word everything the Bible says is true you can rest on that you can rest on on what brother Bram taught because he taught what Paul taught and when he went be the curtain of time they said we're resting on what that you preached nothing but what Paul preached the same thing and then the caterpillar sucks out the life and he said who do we call who we going to call him denomination that's that guy's right name why he's a destroyer sucks to life the restoration of the brid tree 1962 he's already got the bark eat off and the fruits eat off of it and oh brother it's all gone all the gifts of the Spirit is gone no Divine Healing no speaking in tongues no prophecy no nothing don't believe in being prophets they don't believe in these things they don't know all manmade everything they got is man-made artificial the church natural there is a church natural that's the one is made up by man and then I will restore 1957 he said then the gifts will come and they say oh John said this was this and this was that it's the Holy Spirit truly but it can't get through to produce itself these little insects are keeping it down that's the reason we can't have real why this great power that's in the church should have swept her from the sea to shining sea the great church of the Living God should be every Power what does it just as soon as one raises up here comes the caterpillar and starts boring on but one great thing God said it will be that way we see it and God said I will restore I'm looking for it God bless you and um and in the restoration of the brid tree 1962 he said I know we got some late spring late season of Easter coming the Lord is tearing his coming they say everything like that and the cold winds killed a lot of them denominational branches but it can't kill that life that's predestinated because it might look like it's not being restored just like when Ezekiel looks at those Dry Bones he said that I Lord if thou sayest um and Elijah says where this is this is a difficult thing but the Lord the Lord promised it he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not all that he fornew he called those who he called he is Justified those he had Justified he has already glorified hallelujah it's written in the book the Lamb's Book of Life and cannot die and Ezekiel 37 is associated with Hosea 61 through3 which says come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he ha smitten he will bind us up after two days will he revive us two days in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord is going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the light L and former rain un the Earth so now let's go to Ezekiel 37 and start going through the four stages verse one the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out of the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones so the nation of Israel is in a condition where it looks like they uh this the spir spiritual condition of the church the spiritual condition of Israel they've gone after idolatry this uh this this spirit is in four different forms is Whitted away down until they're in the Dark Ages look like looks like nobody has serving yet and and God's going to start restoring and calls me verse two and calls me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry dry because the flesh was completely consumed off of there was nothing left the marrow was all dried up there's no hope in the knle in Ephesians 2:1 it says and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins in Colossians 2:13 and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh have he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses and then verse three and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered oh Lord God God thou knowest and he said thou knowest because if God has anything to do with it nothing is impossible nothing is impossible of them that believe and verse four guine he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh you bones oh you dry bones hear the word of the Lord the prophecy is not just somebody saying something halfhazard but this is going to happen remember when brother BR was preaching on the WRA he said now it's been spoken let it come to pass and there's nothing nothing in the natural no way anything can keep it from coming to pass it's going to come to pass and the prophecy was to the bones spoken to the bones as though they could hear he says speak to the bones and the bones obey the prophecy in verse 5 thus saith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and I looked strongest Concord at what breath is the is the Hebrew word is haruach which means the spirit of God and inspiring ecstatic state of Prophecy as impelling Prophet to utter instruction or warning imparting warlike energy and executive and administrative power and if you look if you read ahead think about a warlike energy they became they stood up and they became an army is endowing men with various gifts as energy of life ain't ancient Angel and later Shaka in verse six and I will lay sinu upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord so the four stages MH sinu flesh skin and breath breath is the last one the Living Word made manifest I think about that in in uh in uh the unpardonable s 1954 brother R said what does the flesh do the flesh only veils the blood the blood is the life that's the only way that keeps life in my body is for the skin and flesh and tissues and sign and so forth to hold the blood in their places so they can give life to this Tabernacle so that I'm dwelling in is that right that's what veiled God for mankind was the blood and sign you and skins of Jesus Christ the son of God the unadulterated birth of his who God the Father overshadowed the Virgin Mary and created in her the blood of his own being the creation and in there his skin kept it from man but one day the sin of man opened up his heart with a spear and his blood ran out on the ground it was give freely for the sins of the world and it's revealed today that's what Ezekiel was talking about the word being revealed today as that blood came forth also came spirit and through the washing of the Water by the blood through the spirit we are born into the kingdom of God new creatures in Christ Jesus in verse 7 so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold was shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone every bone had a match and they all came together in Perfect Harmony I think this is speaking of the Resurrection too if you were all the people that were buried at seed uh destroyed in a bomb or whatever at the resurrection the resurrection uh comes every atom every molecule is going to come back right into its place just like these bones return to their place and it was something done that naturally there's no way but God orchestrated everything just like he orchestrates a child being uh born formed in its mother's womb God keeps his word 1957 he said I've been down to the Pentecostals let me read this whole story and after we had our dinner he said I want to ask you a question Mr brand I said yes sir and I thought oh my here it comes now Lu and Dean and he said I've been down to the Pentecostals and see them kick the furniture around and everything like that but I want to ask you is anything to it I said yes sir there is I said it's like a little kid when he gets a toy he just Falls and I said like Ezekiel said there's a valley full of dry bones he said Can these live he said th know us so he said prophesy to dry bones and when the bones come together there was a rattling and a shaking a lot of noise but then when the skin come on or the meat come on them there wasn't much noise he said prophesy to the spirit now see I think that's what's going on see so I said they I see them make a lot of noise I said I think the bones are coming together and as these bones started coming together and Ezekiel Saw the prophecy coming to path coming to pass I'm sure that his faith increased and we can look around and see the signs of of the time how Israel coming together being joined we'll read further on the two sticks coming together should increase our faith because Israel is the timeline that we watch in verse eight and when I beh beheld L the S and the flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above it but there was no breath in it so the s in the flesh came up it gradually spread and started to look like men m in the shape of men but there's still no breath the sin are holding everything together into one cohesive hole and in verse n he said then said he unto me prophesy under the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus sayith the Lord God come from the Four Winds oh breath and breathe upon these slangs that they may live now Israel was scattered to the Four Winds and the bride will be gathered from the Four Winds and in Matthew 2431 he said he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of the heaven to the other and a greater than Solomon is here 1963 brother say we try to bring it over in one of a bunch and say we got it and you ain't got nothing else to do with it because you don't see through my glasses we mustn't do that it's not right as long as the devil can make you fight one another he don't have to fight so when you see that uniting of the powers of God Gathering his church together from the Four Winds of the earth then you're going to see something take place the questions and answers 1964 and then he said and then shall he send his angels and gather together his elect from the Four Winds and shall it in the up utmost parts of the earth that's talking of the Resurrection the translation going up he'll send forth his angels together did you ever think what the angels are or Messengers he gather them together congregate them together bring them together bind them together from the utmost parts of the Earth to the utmost parts of Heaven the word that was been made manifest on Earth see get it the word has been spoken here it's manifested and then verse 10 so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great Army brother randam said in the restoration of the brid Tre he's talking about the four stages I will restore sayith the Lord the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same signs watch justification brought back the pul sanctification brought back the bar what brought back the leaf Pentecostals what is it Pentecostals leaves clap their hand re Joy rejoicing Pentecostal what the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally after justification been planted sanctification been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations died out and Christ has again centered himself stuff like that cap of the pyramid first line justification sanctification bapt baptism of the Holy Ghost then coming of the cap and the restoration of the Bride tree he said prophesy so man can these bones live wish we had time I got it wrote down here but I have to miss that prophesy can these bones live what's the four stages of that coming forth of that church what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming forth but the life only come not when the sign new skin was on them but the when the wind blowed upon them that's when come back that fourth message of life let's skip down the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally been planted and then paragraph 5:14 what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he come back he'll catch the whole thing in the Rapture with Justified Sanctified in the baptism baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of of God will live again the tree of life is growing again and I'm running out of time so I'm going to skip ahead down to the two sticks verse 15 so God's calling his bride from the Four Winds come come together to manifest his word and we got two sticks one represents Judah and one represents Ephraim remember here Israel turn down the word that were blinded and allow us to be the the wild tree to be grafted in to the tame tree and Israel's being joined together the two sticks were prophesy to be come together and and uh because at the end time brother R preach the sermon the uniting time we are coming together remember the birthright was a a natural many nations and a spiritual many nations uh the natural was uh we have Abraham to our father but Isaac was the seed of the promise and um so we're being united it's part of that the birthright many nations with Christ let me just read real quick Romans 4 um talks about what the birthright is at Romans 4:1 he he receive the sign of circumcision and seal the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being un uncircumcised that he might be the father of all that that believe that they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us off as it is written I made thee a father of many nations skip down to verse 18 who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall ICB and in 1963 the uniting time and sign brother R preach there is a uniting time and that's on right now what is she uniting for the Rapture God's getting her ready yes her uniting what is she uniting in with the word for all heavens and earth will pass away my word shall never pass away she she's uniting herself with thus sayith the Lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody else says she's uniting herself she's getting ready why she is the bride that's right and she's uniting herself with her bridegroom I skip down to trying to do God is her without being the will of God in act 65 and today he's standing Among Us in the person of the Holy Ghost manifesting himself more and more coming into his church making himself known because him and the bride and the groom will be the same making himself known and one day you'll see that the one that you filled in your heart and see his identification will become personalized before you then you and he are the one you youve United by the word and the Word was in the beginning we'll go back to the beginning which is God and that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father and me I and you and you and me and um just read a few more 63 un time and sign when the uniting time comes we're looking like uniting with one another in the bonds of the spirit um it it was the one that was with Moses in the wilderness was the one Upon Jesus Christ and then further down may God help us everyone to unite with Christ tonight surrender our everything that we are everything that we have and look for the time of that United and let's goe and stop there I'm going right here how you do that love
