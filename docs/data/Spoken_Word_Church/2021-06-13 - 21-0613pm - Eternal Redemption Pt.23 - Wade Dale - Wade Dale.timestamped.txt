[20:17] make that devil uncomfortable amen
[20:20] that joker would be uncomfortable i want
[20:22] to be comfortable coming in here
[20:24] amen hebrews 9 11 but christ being
[20:26] coming high priest of good things to
[20:27] come
[20:28] by greater more perfect tabernacle not
[20:30] made with hands that is to say not of
[20:32] this building
[20:33] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[20:35] but by his own blood he entered in once
[20:37] into the holy place
[20:39] having obtained eternal redemption for
[20:42] us now we're going to cover one more
[20:44] uh scripture before we be seated
[20:46] revelations 10 verse 7
[20:49] but in the days of the voice of the
[20:51] seventh angel
[20:52] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[20:56] one mystery amen now there's a lot of
[21:00] mysteries
[21:02] but there's only one mystery that's
[21:04] going to
[21:05] take us out of here the mystery of god
[21:09] should be what finished not started
[21:12] finished
[21:13] as he hath declared to his servants the
[21:16] prophets you may be seated in the lord
[21:18] at his blessing to the reading of the
[21:19] word
[21:20] so let's go to isaiah 7 14 because as
[21:23] brother dale was talking this morning
[21:24] keep in the back of your mind
[21:26] who was the son of man now remember
[21:29] the son of man is indicated by bible
[21:33] indicated by any commentary you know
[21:36] that and brother branham covered it
[21:38] completely
[21:40] that the son of man was when god resided
[21:43] in
[21:44] human flesh all right the son of god or
[21:47] jehovah god was back in the old
[21:49] testament
[21:50] he would come into human flesh and then
[21:52] he would leave
[21:53] melchizedek captain of the host all the
[21:56] different things
[21:57] people would meet god in human flesh but
[21:59] it was temporary that wasn't our savior
[22:02] at the moment that was jehovah god
[22:06] that was god above the people god
[22:08] couldn't get in the people
[22:10] until he came himself and then when he
[22:12] came
[22:13] himself as a baby the son of man was
[22:16] born on the earth
[22:17] everybody got that same amen and the son
[22:19] of god
[22:20] was residing inside that son of man not
[22:23] two people
[22:24] same person not two people not two
[22:27] personalities
[22:28] the same person but it was god in
[22:30] morphine now
[22:31] into a uh um uh i guess you would say
[22:35] a what would you say
[22:38] he he morphed into a spot that he could
[22:42] be the redeemer
[22:43] he morphed into a place or or something
[22:46] he had to come to
[22:47] to be the redeemer of the world now look
[22:50] see though adam was the son of god
[22:52] though you and i are sons and daughters
[22:54] of god we've never reached that position
[22:57] as being the son of man there was only
[22:59] one and the reason i said that is
[23:00] because what brother dale said this
[23:02] morning
[23:02] a lot of people thought brother brown
[23:03] was the son of man he was listen
[23:05] the son of man was born with no sex
[23:10] the son of man was born of
[23:13] from a virgin he did not have a carnal
[23:16] mind
[23:17] he was not all messed up like me and you
[23:19] are
[23:20] brother branham included right you say
[23:23] messed up yeah he was a human
[23:25] right we all come here messed up
[23:28] that's right believe me but
[23:32] jesus did not so the son of man
[23:35] was born with no sex desire he didn't
[23:38] have a father on the earth
[23:40] everybody got that amen so that's the
[23:43] son of man
[23:44] now when we say the son of man but now
[23:47] he had to come to a position as the son
[23:50] of man
[23:51] to to take this redemption plan to
[23:53] another level
[23:54] right all right everybody got that so
[23:57] isaiah 57 verse 14 says the lord himself
[24:00] shall give you a sign behold a virgin
[24:02] shall conceive and bear a son now that's
[24:04] not
[24:05] that's the son of man the son she bore
[24:09] was the son of man
[24:11] now the son of god inhabited that son of
[24:13] man because the son of god is what
[24:15] spirit god that's the holy ghost
[24:18] remember
[24:19] gabriel said you'll be overshadowed by
[24:21] the holy ghost and even brother branham
[24:22] says oh you say
[24:23] that that jesus had a father and his you
[24:25] know he had a father his name was
[24:27] jehovah and he was all this
[24:28] he said what about the bible tells you
[24:30] that the holy ghost was his daddy
[24:32] you get all messed up see when you try
[24:34] to break that apart
[24:35] but you just got to see that the one
[24:37] that spoke it went inside that body
[24:41] the only one that could do that the only
[24:43] one that could bring life
[24:45] out of no sexual desire amen
[24:48] but now see remember though we were all
[24:50] born messed up
[24:51] so he had to come unmessed up for the
[24:53] little ones
[24:54] unmessed up so that he could make us
[24:58] take what we messed up right and unmiss
[25:01] it
[25:02] if that's a word but that's a good way
[25:04] of putting it
[25:05] because that's what the son of man came
[25:07] to do the son of man
[25:09] came to save human beings
[25:15] amen and then he could take that piece
[25:18] of him or part of him
[25:20] and he could take that flesh
[25:23] back to heaven or to heaven or to a
[25:26] seventh dimension
[25:27] everybody wants seventh dimension let's
[25:29] just say seventh dimension
[25:31] and then he sent back that son of god
[25:33] again
[25:36] amen the holy ghost the son of man
[25:39] didn't come back on the day of pentecost
[25:42] because there was no it wasn't his flesh
[25:44] came back
[25:46] but now he sent the holy ghost into
[25:48] human flesh again
[25:49] to make them sons and daughters of god
[25:52] but
[25:52] not a position of the son of man right
[25:56] right everybody all right with that amen
[25:58] all right so now
[25:59] i want you to keep having to back your
[26:00] mind because we're going to roll through
[26:02] some things
[26:03] back to what we were talking about
[26:05] because look he had to come to the jews
[26:07] brother donnie was reading that
[26:08] scripture in isaiah
[26:10] that was the very scripture that i've
[26:11] been quoting you through what paul and
[26:14] them were saying though i turned to the
[26:15] gentiles and we'll read it in a minute
[26:18] because there was a promise of the
[26:21] gentiles to be coming to for
[26:23] gentiles to come in but in the old
[26:25] testament
[26:26] it was not that it was in the old
[26:28] testament that the gentiles was to come
[26:30] in through the jews
[26:34] jews were the bride and then there was
[26:36] going to be a gentile saved
[26:38] right that's what they were saying in
[26:40] the old testament they knew gentiles was
[26:42] going to have a part of it
[26:43] because man you can't explain rahab
[26:46] even abraham all the different ones
[26:50] that they you know pinned their their uh
[26:53] religion on there's always a gentile
[26:56] popped in there somewhere
[26:57] and it's not a pure line of the jews but
[27:00] the problem was
[27:01] once they started messing up or started
[27:03] going
[27:04] whoring as we read in the scripture they
[27:07] went off
[27:09] god had to put them away so when god put
[27:12] him away
[27:13] he's there was the gentile right
[27:16] nations of people he had to put this
[27:19] group of people away
[27:22] and then he had to had this group of
[27:24] people to be his bride
[27:25] because listen god's got to have a body
[27:29] on the earth
[27:31] you say how do you know that well it's
[27:33] all through the scripture why did he
[27:34] write the bible
[27:35] right that's right that's why jesus
[27:38] stood he said look if these people don't
[27:39] cry out
[27:40] he said god will raise rocks up to do it
[27:43] right but he didn't raise rocks up he
[27:45] had people this bible was written to
[27:48] people
[27:49] by people by god through people for
[27:52] people
[27:53] to save people to save human beings and
[27:57] i think i have a quote here
[27:58] that that's what it's it's god was given
[28:02] god give the new birth to human beings
[28:06] so that human beings could be redeemed
[28:09] or regenerated back to what that genesis
[28:13] 1 26 man
[28:14] that was back before the foundation of
[28:16] the world everybody okay with that
[28:19] behold the virgin shall conceive and
[28:21] bring forth a child
[28:23] shall conceive and bear a son and shall
[28:24] call his name emmanuel and then the
[28:26] bible keeps telling us that that
[28:28] emmanuel is what god
[28:30] with us and in other words finally god
[28:33] was our kinsman he was in human flesh as
[28:35] we were reading
[28:36] if you look at boaz and ruth that's the
[28:38] perfect type of
[28:39] of of what that he was what was boaz
[28:43] a man he wasn't portraying the son of
[28:46] god
[28:47] he was portraying the son of man because
[28:50] he was saving somebody that was on earth
[28:53] right he was restoring ruth i mean naomi
[28:56] to get ruth and remember ruth was a
[29:00] gentile
[29:03] naomi was a jew
[29:06] naomi's son was a jew but naomi's son
[29:09] that married he married
[29:11] ruth which was a moabite which was like
[29:14] me and you the brother brother
[29:15] brother mama said a hair and a biscuit
[29:18] because moab was started by white lot
[29:20] and his two
[29:20] daughters having children all right so
[29:24] look what god does though he uses that
[29:28] to show the son of man all the way back
[29:29] in in ruth and boaz
[29:31] that there stood boaz a human man
[29:34] that that could be kinsmen to
[29:38] naomi but in getting naomi in redeeming
[29:41] naomi
[29:42] he gets roots so in redeeming the jews
[29:45] or
[29:46] to bring the jews he gets a bright a
[29:48] gentile bride
[29:49] right but he is going to bring israel
[29:52] back we know that by daniel 70
[29:55] let's read isaiah 53 just fly through
[29:58] this real quick
[30:00] he was taken from prison and from
[30:01] judgment who shall declare his
[30:03] generation
[30:04] for he was cut off of the land of living
[30:05] now see remember what we were talking
[30:08] about just reached just now
[30:11] what genealogy is he declaring
[30:15] because a generation is a genealogy what
[30:18] genealogy is he declaring
[30:19] not israel
[30:23] who's going to declare his generation
[30:25] the bride
[30:26] right the ones that are his progeny are
[30:29] his
[30:29] genealogy his spiritual genealogy
[30:33] he's not going to forget israel but now
[30:35] they have no line as far
[30:37] it looked if even in the natural like i
[30:40] said before i'm not gonna preach on
[30:41] marriage and divorce but still you gotta
[30:43] hold it where god put her away
[30:46] she went whoring in other words she went
[30:49] and went into
[30:50] um trying to get this right
[30:53] making love to other gods
[30:57] and see if your wife leaves you and does
[31:00] that
[31:00] you can't take her back so he can't take
[31:03] he can't restore her back
[31:05] even god almighty can't go by what aft
[31:07] go over what his word says
[31:09] right right so he can't take her back
[31:12] now he
[31:12] she's still there she's going to have a
[31:15] position but she can't be bright anymore
[31:18] she can't be the body of christ anymore
[31:20] so
[31:21] now you and i though being the body of
[31:23] christ
[31:25] we shall declare we're the only ones
[31:26] that can declare
[31:28] since the day of pentecost that's what's
[31:30] being half that's what's been happening
[31:32] his generation has been declared through
[31:36] seven church ages all right
[31:40] as the son of god though not the son of
[31:42] man
[31:43] now it's really tricky because you got
[31:45] to be careful that is the son of god
[31:47] down through seven church ages
[31:48] working in human flesh
[31:53] but they don't have enough men of the
[31:54] ministry of jesus christ to make it
[31:56] completely
[31:57] the son of man in the end time we'll get
[31:59] to that in just a little while okay
[32:01] who shall declare his generation for he
[32:03] was cut off
[32:04] out of the land of the living for the
[32:06] transgression of my people was he
[32:07] stricken
[32:08] because remember jesus didn't have any
[32:09] children so there was no genealogy for
[32:11] him
[32:11] natural so where was his children
[32:14] started on the day of pentecost 120
[32:16] little jesuses were born
[32:18] and now you've got it all down to the
[32:19] church ages many other little jesuses
[32:22] are born by what
[32:23] regening of our mind amen
[32:27] and not an exchange of our soul but take
[32:29] that soul and clean it up
[32:30] right that's the business of the son of
[32:33] god
[32:34] everybody got that when you receive the
[32:36] new birth you receive the son of god in
[32:38] your soul
[32:41] which makes you the children of god
[32:44] now that made the children of god down
[32:45] through the seven church ages
[32:48] but at the end time though all the
[32:50] mystery of god should be finished
[32:53] so there was a mystery that wasn't
[32:54] finished in the other church ages that's
[32:56] right
[32:59] let's read verse 10 save time yet it
[33:02] please the lord to bruise him
[33:04] he hath put him to grief when thou shalt
[33:06] make his soul an offering for sinners
[33:07] shall see a seed
[33:08] listen there you go back
[33:12] where's what's progeny what's genealogy
[33:14] what's generations
[33:16] that includes the seed of man
[33:20] natural genealogies but he will only see
[33:23] his seed
[33:25] he gave his life so that he could see
[33:28] his seed right that's what he said he
[33:29] made his soul an offering for sin
[33:32] he shall see his seed now who is his
[33:34] seed his seed started on the day of
[33:37] pentecost
[33:38] and continued to this day not back in
[33:41] the old testament
[33:44] he put them away so he couldn't have
[33:45] seen he couldn't have a bride through
[33:47] that
[33:48] group right i'm trying to watch my words
[33:51] here
[33:52] to not be you know i don't want to get
[33:54] too hard for the kids to understand
[33:57] but he shall see his seed he shall
[33:59] prolong his days and the pleasure of the
[34:01] lord
[34:01] shall prosper in his hand that's me and
[34:03] you he gave his soul an offer now listen
[34:06] he died for everybody but he knows who
[34:08] would accept and who wouldn't accept who
[34:09] would be bride and who would not be
[34:10] bride now that
[34:11] you should know that john 1 verse 11
[34:14] says he came unto his own and his own
[34:15] received him not
[34:17] but as many that's me and you as many as
[34:19] received him
[34:20] to them gave he power to become the sons
[34:23] of god now
[34:24] he didn't just say okay you're a son of
[34:25] god
[34:27] he had he had to place his seed there to
[34:30] be children of god you got
[34:32] to be children of your parents you've
[34:33] got to have the seed of the parents
[34:34] inside of you
[34:36] or the genealogy of the parents well
[34:38] jesus didn't have a knife he had natural
[34:40] seed but he never
[34:41] never used it but it was spiritual seed
[34:44] the word of god is the spiritual seed
[34:46] that you and i need to worry about not
[34:48] all this other genealogy you know paul
[34:49] even looks at him he says
[34:51] i'm tired of your endless genealogies so
[34:53] and so but god so and so on so and so we
[34:54] got so and so
[34:55] and that was okay in the old testament
[34:57] because to me the old testament
[34:59] was a recorder it recorded genealogy
[35:02] because it was important
[35:03] in the old testament he said
[35:06] keep your gene line clean don't mingle
[35:09] with them people out there
[35:11] and the problem with it was they didn't
[35:13] listen to that but they
[35:14] they did but as many as received them to
[35:17] him what
[35:17] gave the them power to become the sons
[35:20] of god even to them
[35:22] they believe on his name which were born
[35:23] not of blood see there we go
[35:26] not a blood because see if you're born
[35:28] of blood that makes you blood can
[35:31] your blood can to people on the earth
[35:35] but not to god you got to be born what
[35:37] again
[35:40] see very simple which were born not of
[35:42] blood so boom you can stop it right
[35:44] there he's not talking about flesh
[35:46] that's right he's talking about your new
[35:49] birth
[35:50] which is covered by the blood of jesus
[35:52] christ
[35:53] not the blood of your mom and daddy not
[35:56] of blood nor of the will of the flesh
[35:59] nor the will of man but of god so that
[36:02] pretty much brought it right down
[36:03] together and
[36:04] and the word was made flesh
[36:08] and dwelt among us i got a quote brother
[36:10] brown meets in the rising of the sun he
[36:11] said who is this son of man he said in
[36:13] the beginning was a word he quotes this
[36:14] scripture right here
[36:17] see he took it all the way back to the
[36:18] beginning
[36:20] john 1 14 brings it to when he was made
[36:22] flesh
[36:23] but that was the whole part of jesus's
[36:25] whole
[36:26] the whole plan the whole plan we know it
[36:29] it's based on resurrection but it's
[36:31] based on him becoming flesh
[36:34] and then getting in flesh because in the
[36:37] in the genesis that's what stopped god
[36:39] from becoming flesh
[36:43] was the natural act between adam and eve
[36:45] the womb was closed up there was no way
[36:47] god could get to any one of them
[36:49] spiritually anymore
[36:50] the way he wanted to to create his
[36:53] children
[36:54] because he didn't want him sexually he
[36:56] wanted them by spoken seed word of god
[37:01] satan knew that too
[37:05] satan knew it and that's why he
[37:06] perverted it he went straight to the
[37:08] very one thing he knew could stop god
[37:09] from coming
[37:10] in human flesh and then what did
[37:13] satan start doing he started coming down
[37:15] and anointing that human flesh
[37:18] that's why in the old testament you had
[37:19] problems you had david and all the
[37:21] different ones that did the things
[37:22] killed people and
[37:23] and all that moses was a murderer but he
[37:25] was the biggest prophet that ever was in
[37:27] the old testament but he murdered
[37:28] he murdered an egyptian
[37:32] because he didn't have the new birth but
[37:34] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[37:37] us and we beheld his glory the glory is
[37:39] of the only begotten of the father
[37:41] full of grace and truth now listen
[37:45] and now i'm saying to you that the word
[37:47] is being made flesh again
[37:51] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[37:54] glory
[37:54] as thinking brother dale was preaching
[37:55] this morning
[37:58] when you look at the son of man it's not
[38:00] in one man anymore
[38:01] i just proved that there was only one
[38:04] position
[38:05] for the son of man to come thee
[38:09] and thee constitutes one person
[38:12] he came and did what he was supposed to
[38:14] do in that time
[38:15] slot that's what i was trying to get the
[38:17] time slot he came and did what he's
[38:19] supposed to do
[38:20] now it was the son of god through the
[38:22] church ages we're going to read where
[38:23] brother brown
[38:23] says that but now right at the end time
[38:27] the son of man's got to come back but
[38:28] he's not he was the son of man with no
[38:31] bride and nobody at that moment that he
[38:33] was here
[38:34] everybody got that think with me a
[38:36] minute that when jesus was on earth
[38:38] there was no bride
[38:41] that's right because it brides his body
[38:44] he had a natural body there he couldn't
[38:46] have two bodies
[38:47] right he had already put israel away
[38:49] before he got here really
[38:52] he came to his own but he knew they
[38:53] weren't going to accept it so he
[38:54] couldn't take him as bride
[38:56] so he came to me and you
[39:01] in that time slot the son of man the
[39:04] only man that could die
[39:06] be buried resurrected and not just come
[39:09] back
[39:09] see look lazarus died
[39:12] was buried and was resurrected
[39:16] but he died again and the
[39:19] the soul of lazarus even though as pure
[39:22] as we may think it is
[39:24] by the new birth if he was ever born
[39:25] again never was shown he was but
[39:27] if he was he couldn't be the son of man
[39:30] because he died again literally
[39:34] died physically let's put it that way he
[39:36] physically died
[39:38] but jesus comes out of the grave and he
[39:40] said i am alive forevermore
[39:43] i have the keys of death in hell we read
[39:44] that in the book of revelation
[39:46] he had overtook the grave hell death and
[39:49] everything
[39:49] and he said i don't have to die anymore
[39:53] so there's the person we want to talk to
[39:56] that's right right now you say oh now be
[39:59] careful well
[40:01] our attitude's gonna have to change
[40:05] from being a second person to of of god
[40:10] to being collectively now the son of man
[40:14] i said collectively because remember he
[40:16] came as one person he does not have to
[40:17] come back as one person anymore
[40:19] he's done his job he filled his time
[40:22] slot as the son of man then he was the
[40:24] son of god through seven church ages
[40:26] but there held the re who said i am the
[40:28] resurrection and the life
[40:30] the son of man said i am the
[40:31] resurrection and the life
[40:33] amen and then in the end time god had to
[40:36] show just for a moment another time
[40:38] slot between the 40s and the 50s and the
[40:40] 60s
[40:41] through one man he showed what was
[40:44] supposed to be done
[40:45] in the end time according to luke 17 30
[40:48] when the son of man was to come back in
[40:50] the end time
[40:51] but now brother branham was not the son
[40:53] of man he was
[40:54] a son of man you and i are all the son
[40:57] of man in a collective
[41:00] not one person you can't fulfill that
[41:03] because listen
[41:04] you know why you can't fulfill it none
[41:06] of you sitting here with virgin born
[41:08] right but now by the new birth that's
[41:11] why you've got to cover you've got to
[41:13] watch your scripture and cover the
[41:15] quotes
[41:15] where you're talking natural and where
[41:17] you're talking spiritual
[41:18] because by the spiritual birth yes we
[41:21] are we weren't we are all virgins
[41:23] by the spiritual birth but by the
[41:25] natural birth we're not
[41:27] right we're all born in sin we're all
[41:29] born by sex we all came the exact same
[41:31] way i don't care if you
[41:32] preach king i don't care if you have a
[41:34] billion dollars we all came the same way
[41:37] and if time goes on we're all going out
[41:40] the same way
[41:43] but jesus filled that slot
[41:48] i am the resurrection in the life i am
[41:50] the way the truth and the life
[41:52] as brother brown said in the quote we
[41:54] were talking about he didn't come to
[41:56] bring you
[41:57] your redemption your redemption was
[42:00] already over here
[42:01] but he knew that it got lost
[42:05] and then as it got lost he had to come
[42:08] and bring it away for you to get back to
[42:10] it
[42:12] to be regened or regenerated to be able
[42:14] to declare
[42:16] that general listen what generation was
[42:18] he declaring
[42:19] was he telling us to declare genesis 1
[42:23] 26-27 that's all his children
[42:26] that's his progeny that's that's what he
[42:28] came for
[42:29] and man that genesis why i said that's
[42:31] the most important for you to understand
[42:33] that genesis 1 26 man
[42:36] if you had if you weren't there you're
[42:38] not going to be there he didn't come to
[42:39] get you
[42:40] but if you buy the new birth if you ever
[42:42] get born again
[42:44] you were there
[42:47] no way you can miss it right and you
[42:49] weren't there in no form except
[42:51] in god i'm telling you folks if you get
[42:55] a true revelation
[42:57] the problem with a lot of people is
[42:58] they're not born again like i said
[43:00] before
[43:00] we need to just face this thing look in
[43:02] the mirror have you ever asked
[43:04] if you ever have you ever asked yourself
[43:06] hey buddy
[43:07] you born again you wake up look at that
[43:10] thing in the mirror every day
[43:13] in this worst form amen
[43:18] look at that thing and say are you born
[43:19] again
[43:22] do you know that you know that you know
[43:24] because you know what i don't look in
[43:26] the mirror and see brother john
[43:30] that'd be weird especially in the
[43:33] morning in my bathroom
[43:37] but i see me and you see you
[43:42] that's our worst enemy your worst enemy
[43:45] is not
[43:46] somebody in your classmate they're not
[43:47] no your worst enemy is you
[43:50] but if we can look at ourself and
[43:52] honestly say god if i'm not born again
[43:54] please
[43:56] please birth me into this body i want it
[43:59] more than anything
[44:01] i won't go to work today if i knew it
[44:04] hell
[44:05] don't be lazy not go to work though okay
[44:09] the fedex guy
[44:12] i'm glad you got a job there though
[44:14] that's good
[44:16] but the word was made flesh and dwelt
[44:18] among us in this time period right here
[44:21] but now he left and he said i'm coming
[44:23] back
[44:25] see lazarus couldn't say i'm coming back
[44:27] abraham couldn't say i'm coming back
[44:29] none of those could say i'm coming back
[44:30] but there was one man standing on earth
[44:32] he said i can come back
[44:34] i can do this thing you destroy this
[44:36] temple i'll raise it up in three days
[44:39] you do whatever you need to do because
[44:41] remember his soul is what is going to
[44:43] save you not his body
[44:46] he gave his soul a ransom so he could
[44:49] see a seed he gave his soul
[44:50] so that you know what he'd done he went
[44:52] down and met the devil and said look
[44:54] i'm here right now i've come in human
[44:58] flesh
[44:59] it's laying up there in the tomb you can
[45:00] go up there i'm sure the devil knew
[45:02] where it was at anyway
[45:03] he said you can go up there and look he
[45:05] said i died for them
[45:08] but now today you're going to give me
[45:10] the keys
[45:11] of death and hell you've held it for
[45:13] several thousand years
[45:15] you're going to hand it to me today and
[45:17] i'm going back
[45:18] up and i'm going to save these people
[45:22] and the devil because there's nothing he
[45:24] couldn't try to block it there's no way
[45:26] in hell he could do it right
[45:30] no way he couldn't do it hell couldn't
[45:33] stop him the devil couldn't stop him
[45:35] nobody could stop what he was going to
[45:36] do why because he had already
[45:39] listened he raised on the scripture
[45:42] he died by scripture he lived by
[45:45] scripture
[45:46] because he was the scripture but now
[45:49] what about me and you
[45:50] he said no no i'm this over here i was
[45:53] born in sin i've got all these problems
[45:57] well get born again you might have them
[45:59] but you'll know how to deal with them
[46:02] you'll know how to deal with them
[46:07] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[46:08] among us and beheld the glory and glory
[46:10] of the only begotten of the father
[46:12] for the grace and truth now jeremiah 3
[46:14] verse 8
[46:16] and i saw when for all the causes were
[46:18] by backsliding israel committed adultery
[46:21] i had put her away and give her a bill
[46:22] of divorcement
[46:24] yet her treacherous sister judah feared
[46:26] not but went and played the harlot
[46:28] also so we know that we read there
[46:31] in romans let's just go to romans real
[46:33] quick that blindness in part has
[46:34] happened to israel
[46:35] until the fullness of the gentiles
[46:37] become in now what about
[46:39] a man i was thinking about this other
[46:40] day what about a man
[46:43] lived 30 years 33 years jesus and he
[46:46] walked on earth
[46:47] now he comes to his ministry he's around
[46:50] jews the whole time
[46:54] he goes to the temple he's 13 years old
[46:56] he goes to the temple there's a lot of
[46:58] things that he does in this temple
[47:01] but when he comes to his ministry on the
[47:04] river jordan
[47:05] and the holy ghost anoints him for his
[47:07] message
[47:08] i believe he realizes hey
[47:13] i've not come to this people right
[47:18] because he said he said
[47:21] john said he came to his own but now he
[47:23] over in the scripture
[47:24] he talks about going to the lost sheep
[47:26] of the house of israel oh yeah
[47:28] so in his mind he's going i think i'm
[47:30] going to try and he did try to convert
[47:32] him why did he go to the why did he go
[47:34] to the
[47:34] to the temples why did he go to the
[47:36] feast days why did he go
[47:38] to these different places because he
[47:40] wanted to convert them he wanted them to
[47:43] believe who he was
[47:44] right but they didn't believe him and
[47:48] then finally he just said
[47:49] forget it because even paul even paul
[47:52] with the holy ghost
[47:53] paul tried his best to get the jews to
[47:56] believe it
[47:57] right that's right because there were a
[48:01] certain group of jews that did believe
[48:02] it 120 in the upper room were all jews
[48:06] but when they dispersed out with the
[48:07] 3000 it was people all over the place
[48:10] and look where paul went if you look at
[48:12] his map paul went all over
[48:14] asia in different places trying to
[48:16] convert and set up
[48:17] churches and he was meeting jews in
[48:20] every little spot and there
[48:21] and they're like oh we're going to stone
[48:22] him we're going to kill him we're going
[48:24] to drive him off of a cliff
[48:25] he's a mad man we don't want to hear
[48:27] anything from him
[48:28] and then all of a sudden he says lo
[48:34] i turned to the gentiles
[48:38] he had had enough he didn't want no more
[48:41] of it he had had enough
[48:43] but he's the one that wrote in romans oh
[48:46] yeah
[48:46] see paul wrote this for i would not
[48:49] brother that you should be ignorant of
[48:50] this mystery
[48:51] unless you should be wise in your own
[48:53] conceit that blindness in part happened
[48:55] to israel until the fullness of the
[48:57] gentiles
[48:58] be come in and so all israel shall be
[49:00] saved
[49:02] as it is written there shall come out of
[49:04] zion the deliverance shall turn away
[49:05] ungodliness from jacob that's each quote
[49:07] in scripture
[49:08] but this is my covenant unto them when i
[49:10] shall take away their sin now
[49:12] according to daniel 7 to which in daniel
[49:14] 9 24 that's what happened
[49:16] he redeems israel as part of this
[49:18] eternal plan
[49:19] he redeems israel when i shall take away
[49:21] their
[49:22] sins as concerning the gospel they are
[49:25] enemies for your sake
[49:26] but as touching the election they are
[49:28] beloved for the father's sake
[49:30] so the blindness in part though is going
[49:32] to be taken away because right now like
[49:34] i said before
[49:35] right now they don't want to have no
[49:36] part with a gentile they still believe
[49:39] the messiah is going to come to them
[49:43] by elijah and the elijah cup and listen
[49:46] the the real good orthodox jew has never
[49:48] strayed away from the bible
[49:50] now the ones dad and him met over in
[49:52] jerusalem was common people they didn't
[49:54] care about they were just jews
[49:56] right they were just jews they were just
[49:59] like us they were just born but they
[50:00] happened to be born jews
[50:02] but now the real true orthodox jew
[50:06] sits there and believes that elijah's
[50:09] gonna come
[50:10] and then the messiah's going to come
[50:12] they literally believe that's going to
[50:13] happen
[50:14] and then when you take the gospel why
[50:16] did why did god stop william branham
[50:18] from going
[50:19] to israel because he knew they would
[50:23] accept it
[50:25] that's what brother brown kept saying
[50:26] man they'll accept this and that person
[50:27] said well they'll accept this brother
[50:29] brown you take them out here on the
[50:30] plane and you show them
[50:31] what was he going to show them the sign
[50:34] of the son of man
[50:37] the messiah is god in human flesh
[50:41] amen that's what messiah will be
[50:44] that's why i asked that priest he said
[50:46] well what will messiah be he said
[50:48] brother adam he'll be god in human flesh
[50:51] well that's what he wants already
[50:53] so he could brother brown on either
[50:54] broke every scripture in the world in
[50:56] the whole bible
[50:57] if god would allowed him to go you
[51:00] wouldn't have needed two prophets
[51:02] because israel would have been born in a
[51:04] day right there but see that was the
[51:05] elijah anointing i believe of william
[51:07] branham trying to get over there
[51:10] i said the anointing of elijah because
[51:12] you know what the anointing of elijah is
[51:13] it's to turn the jews back because
[51:16] what's number five gonna do
[51:18] gonna turn the jews back that fifth
[51:21] message
[51:22] of elijah is going to turn the hearts of
[51:25] the
[51:25] fathers to the children right
[51:29] and they're going to get born again the
[51:31] old
[51:32] the old fathers the old orthodox fathers
[51:34] he's going to turn them into newborn
[51:36] babes in christ
[51:39] it's just all it's just a cycle of of
[51:42] elijah
[51:43] that's his ministry is to turn the
[51:45] hearts back
[51:46] even the first elijah he said lord i
[51:48] pray even on carmel they'll turn that
[51:50] this will turn their heart back
[51:53] so that's happened the whole time so
[51:54] daniel 9 24
[51:57] says 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[51:59] people and upon that holy city now
[52:01] it's going to do six things
[52:04] and this is all going to happen now look
[52:06] this is all going to happen
[52:09] when we're gone because he can't save
[52:11] them while we're here
[52:14] right right so this six-fold purpose is
[52:17] not going to happen
[52:18] while we're here okay
[52:21] the six-fold purpose will only happen
[52:23] after we leave
[52:25] all right know therefore and understand
[52:27] from the going forth commandment to
[52:28] restore and build jerusalem
[52:30] see they're going to build a temple even
[52:32] while we're while we're up in another
[52:34] dimension they're going to come back
[52:35] down here and build a millennium temple
[52:37] so all this has got like brother dale
[52:39] many times he showed me that
[52:41] this is it's a parable to us because
[52:43] none of this is happening
[52:46] while we're here us today physically
[52:50] everybody got that
[52:51] because remember messiah was cut off
[52:53] 2000 years ago
[52:55] peter may have been there and john may
[52:56] have been there but physically you and i
[52:58] were not there
[52:59] right amen
[53:03] and after three score in two weeks shall
[53:04] my side be cut off according to
[53:07] isaiah 53 he was cut off from the land
[53:11] of the living
[53:13] okay it was cut off they thought they
[53:15] got rid of him
[53:16] but what happened is it brought him to
[53:18] where he could come inside me and you
[53:21] where the cell was broken so that he
[53:23] could bring life to me and you
[53:25] and then the prince is going to destroy
[53:26] the city we know that was titus that was
[53:28] a gentile
[53:30] and he shall confirm the covenant of
[53:31] many for one week now we know one
[53:33] thing's for sure
[53:34] we're not here when this covenant signed
[53:37] so that one week has got to happen
[53:39] after the rapture takes place so
[53:41] whatever you hear
[53:42] anyone preach if it's not if it's half
[53:44] weeks and half this
[53:45] just forget about it it's not bible 69
[53:49] weeks have already happened there's one
[53:50] week left from 69 weeks to one week to
[53:52] the one week
[53:53] there's a 2 000 year gap of gentile
[53:56] bride that's what we've been reading
[53:59] because in luke 24 verse 46 jesus said
[54:02] thus it is written and dusted behoove
[54:04] christ the suffering rise from the dead
[54:05] the third day
[54:06] and that repentance and remission of sin
[54:08] should be preached in his name among all
[54:10] nations beginning at jerusalem
[54:13] and your witness of these things
[54:16] and behold i'll send the promise of my
[54:18] father upon you now what was the promise
[54:19] he had already told him
[54:21] that he was going to send the holy ghost
[54:22] he was going to send the comforter
[54:24] and behold i send the promise of my
[54:26] father upon you but tarry ye in the city
[54:28] of jerusalem
[54:29] until you be endued with power from on
[54:32] high and that word
[54:34] endue means what to sink into
[54:37] you see there's a difference in being
[54:40] anointed by the holy ghost
[54:42] and being filled by the holy ghost many
[54:45] anointings
[54:46] and when i say filling i mean filling
[54:48] down in the soul
[54:50] not filling on your spirit that's just
[54:52] an anointing
[54:53] so that holy ghost sank into peter and
[54:56] john
[54:57] and all the different ones that were in
[54:59] the upper room and then they became sons
[55:02] and daughters of god and there started
[55:04] the progeny of jesus christ or isaiah 53
[55:07] to be fulfilled
[55:09] because it was the filling of the holy
[55:10] ghost but now listen that was
[55:13] the son of god dispensation began i'll
[55:16] read it to you in a few minutes where
[55:17] brother brown said the son of god
[55:18] dispensation
[55:19] started on the day of pentecost it
[55:20] started through the seven church ages
[55:22] went through seven church ages the son
[55:24] of god which was the holy ghost and the
[55:26] people
[55:26] everybody okay with that for those of
[55:29] you that are awake
[55:31] acts 13 verse 46
[55:35] just keep on rolling down through them
[55:37] because they spoke with thomas we know
[55:38] it
[55:38] dispersed everywhere but we turn to the
[55:40] gentiles see in the book of acts when
[55:42] the first
[55:43] began paul and barnabas waxed bold and
[55:45] said it was necessary the word of god
[55:46] should first have been spoken to you
[55:48] who'd you talk to the jews
[55:52] listen god give them an opportunity to
[55:54] repent
[55:56] and they turned him down he was standing
[55:58] there in human flesh and they turned him
[56:00] down
[56:02] see what they'll do if they turn you
[56:03] down same thing
[56:05] so revelations 1. so then after we turn
[56:08] to the gentiles
[56:09] we see in revelations 1 verse 13
[56:12] down to verse 20. let's go to 20. you
[56:15] know these things we're just going to
[56:16] try to
[56:17] glean i try to get to the end where we
[56:19] can read some quotes for brother i'm
[56:20] talking about the son of man
[56:21] the mystery of the seven stars which now
[56:23] saw us in our right hand and the seven
[56:25] golden candlesticks
[56:26] the seven stars are the angels of the
[56:28] seven churches
[56:30] and the seven candlesticks which thousa
[56:32] are the seven
[56:33] churches now brother branham preached
[56:37] the church ages and then he preached the
[56:39] seals right
[56:40] preached to church ages in 60 they
[56:42] compiled the book and then in 1963
[56:45] he preached the seals see the seals
[56:47] wouldn't have come out right
[56:49] if he had not if he had switched them or
[56:51] had not preached that
[56:52] to me one of the most important series
[56:55] would be that church age series
[56:57] because he named dave he got all the
[56:59] dates right he got all the people
[57:01] right and he got all the characteristics
[57:03] and all that right
[57:04] because it was in the bible but now see
[57:07] these angels which are messengers
[57:09] no one was ever able to say okay number
[57:12] one was paul
[57:14] number two was irenaeus number three was
[57:16] martin
[57:17] columba all the way down but god sent us
[57:19] a prophet
[57:20] and then i don't see how in the world
[57:22] people why did god waste his time on
[57:25] william branham if he's wrong
[57:29] maybe i'll wake some of you up cause
[57:32] y'all bad sleeping today bob it's bad
[57:36] but ain't nothing to do about it the
[57:38] seven stars are the angels
[57:40] how no one ever said no one ever had
[57:44] enough of the word of god to stand up
[57:46] and say
[57:47] paul was the first church age messenger
[57:50] because who would you
[57:52] pick
[57:54] who did you pick for number two
[57:58] because all you're going by is history
[58:02] but i believe god gave william branham a
[58:04] vision
[58:07] of exactly who it was so you and i could
[58:10] have what
[58:11] confidence in what that man said
[58:15] confidence in what the prophet of god
[58:17] said to tell us who these seven angels
[58:19] are
[58:19] and that they're men they were
[58:21] messengers with a message and they
[58:22] brought a message to a group of people
[58:24] and that group of people accepted or
[58:26] rejected that church age messenger
[58:31] what a wonderful god and then when
[58:35] brother brown gets finished with the
[58:36] whole
[58:37] series god
[58:41] plasters it on the back wall of the of
[58:44] the tabernacle
[58:45] showing even the
[58:48] of course we don't have the the one with
[58:49] the lines on it that has the black and
[58:51] white the round circles
[58:52] but they said somebody was testifying
[58:56] that had been there
[58:57] that it just it just like somebody was
[58:58] writing it and drawing the whole thing
[59:00] drawing
[59:01] well it wasn't man and it wasn't the
[59:04] devil because the devil would have got
[59:05] it wrong
[59:06] it had to be god it had to be god
[59:10] vindicating what like i said one more
[59:12] time why did god
[59:13] waste his time on such a man that's
[59:16] right
[59:16] if he wasn't our messenger why would he
[59:19] waste time and
[59:21] yeah come on we gotta either believe it
[59:25] or get in or get out one
[59:26] one of the two but the greek lexicon
[59:29] says the star is what a messenger
[59:32] not just a messenger but a messenger
[59:34] from god
[59:35] amen okay this messenger didn't come
[59:38] from the antichrist
[59:40] these messengers came from god these
[59:43] church age messengers were the seven
[59:45] stars
[59:46] now why couldn't god get it right he had
[59:48] seven of them in his hand
[59:51] so see if william branham was wrong
[59:52] god's wrong you see how it just keeps
[59:54] rolling backwards
[59:56] that's what god that's what satan wants
[59:58] you to believe that god's not right and
[59:59] no other body else is right but him
[1:00:01] yeah so you know where that statement
[1:00:04] comes in it comes from the devil
[1:00:06] amen but god promised us
[1:00:10] according to revelations 10 7 that he
[1:00:12] would send us a seventh messenger from
[1:00:14] god
[1:00:16] read revelation 10 7 he sent a messenger
[1:00:19] from god
[1:00:20] the seventh church aged messenger will
[1:00:22] come from god
[1:00:23] and this mystery will be finished
[1:00:28] as he has declared it to all the other
[1:00:30] prophets
[1:00:31] so let's read number one spoken words
[1:00:33] original seed is right here
[1:00:34] the messenger of malachi 4 will appear
[1:00:36] at god's appointed time
[1:00:38] we're all looking for him we believe he
[1:00:39] will come that is according to his word
[1:00:42] it will be at the end time which it is
[1:00:44] time now for to see it
[1:00:46] he will be correctly dedicated to the
[1:00:48] word as they have always been indicated
[1:00:50] by god's word
[1:00:52] and a vindicated god will vindicate what
[1:00:55] the preacher
[1:00:56] what he preaches to be the truth as he
[1:01:00] did elijah for is
[1:01:01] is elijah coming making ready for the
[1:01:04] mount zion
[1:01:06] rapture okay
[1:01:09] rapture couldn't take place in any other
[1:01:11] age but this age so he sent a messenger
[1:01:14] with a rapture message with a
[1:01:16] resurrection message
[1:01:17] amen now let's read number two
[1:01:21] now see if we don't get this right then
[1:01:23] we've only got malachi
[1:01:24] 4 coming in william branham just to
[1:01:27] bring us back
[1:01:29] to the faith of the fathers right and
[1:01:31] the faith of the fathers
[1:01:33] all those fathers are passed away been
[1:01:36] in the grave for 2000 years
[1:01:38] right amen they had the pure word of god
[1:01:42] but they didn't have that revelation of
[1:01:44] the mystery of the seals
[1:01:46] that jesus was trying to get preached in
[1:01:48] matthew 24.
[1:01:51] okay we'll get to in just a second i'm
[1:01:52] getting ahead of myself according to
[1:01:53] malachi
[1:01:54] 4 and revelations 10 7. so brother brown
[1:01:57] brought in malachi
[1:01:58] 4 but he also had to bring in revelation
[1:02:00] 10 7 to do the two things
[1:02:04] all right he's going to do two things
[1:02:06] one according to malachi 4 he will turn
[1:02:07] the hearts of the children
[1:02:09] to the fathers now children the hearts
[1:02:11] of the children when he started on in 19
[1:02:14] whatever 33 in the different times
[1:02:16] he was talking to pentecostal babies all
[1:02:18] right
[1:02:20] that thought that that was it this is
[1:02:21] the coming of the lord this is the
[1:02:24] latter rain movement this is the this is
[1:02:26] the last
[1:02:31] he said y'all ain't even got the first
[1:02:32] yet you think how much they hated him
[1:02:35] when they put their whole
[1:02:36] thing on this right here this azusa
[1:02:38] street and everything going after that
[1:02:40] the gifts and all that
[1:02:41] but what did they do they cabbage down
[1:02:43] when you don't know what cabbage down
[1:02:45] means
[1:02:46] a cabbage is a little low plant that
[1:02:47] doesn't move you have to pick it
[1:02:49] so they what did they do they said this
[1:02:51] is it
[1:02:53] this is the moo this is the last move of
[1:02:54] god if you don't speak in tongues you
[1:02:56] ain't got the holy ghost
[1:02:57] if you don't believe this and that and
[1:02:59] the other you ain't got the holy ghost
[1:03:00] if you don't believe us
[1:03:01] you don't have the holy ghost and then
[1:03:04] brother brown comes along and says okay
[1:03:05] i'll take that
[1:03:07] but or plus he said i'll take that
[1:03:11] speaking in tongues is good these
[1:03:13] evidences are good
[1:03:15] but it's not the evidence of the holy
[1:03:16] ghost and he spent
[1:03:18] years trying to teach those babbling
[1:03:20] babies
[1:03:21] the faith of the fathers back to the day
[1:03:23] of pentecost
[1:03:24] where it wasn't speaking in tongues that
[1:03:26] gave them the holy ghost
[1:03:28] they spoke in tongues after they got the
[1:03:30] holy ghost and
[1:03:31] some of most of that was in another
[1:03:33] language that everybody understood so it
[1:03:35] was not in the
[1:03:36] speaking it was in the hearing so faith
[1:03:39] comes by speaking
[1:03:41] faith comes by hearing all right
[1:03:44] they heard a message from peter and got
[1:03:47] the holy ghost
[1:03:48] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:03:50] seven thunders in revelations 10
[1:03:52] remember revelation
[1:03:53] 10 about four five and six he told john
[1:03:56] not to write them
[1:03:58] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:03:59] seven thunders in revelations 10
[1:04:01] which are the revelations contained in
[1:04:03] the seven seals it will be these
[1:04:05] divinely revealed
[1:04:07] mystery truths so the devil can't
[1:04:11] take that and bring it to you
[1:04:14] only god is divine divinely revealed
[1:04:18] mystery truths that
[1:04:19] literally turn the hearts now listen
[1:04:22] i preached this a long time ago but
[1:04:24] literally is not a type
[1:04:26] literally it's not i'm not standing up
[1:04:28] here as a type of samuel wade dale ii
[1:04:31] i'm literally the man
[1:04:34] so the literal son of man in bride form
[1:04:38] right amen in bribe form has to be in
[1:04:42] the end time
[1:04:43] i said in bribe form not in that time
[1:04:46] slot that he was the son of man the
[1:04:48] person one man
[1:04:49] right he has now a morphed me morphy
[1:04:52] and morphed himself into a bride
[1:04:55] to be though by the revelation of these
[1:04:58] thunders and the seals which are the
[1:05:00] same
[1:05:01] it's going to literally turn us back
[1:05:05] to the pentecostal fathers and i don't
[1:05:07] believe that's the pentecostal fathers
[1:05:09] anywhere you've ever seen in your life
[1:05:12] everything's a base sure we have a
[1:05:14] pentecostal basis in
[1:05:16] paul's age the book of acts and all
[1:05:18] these different things but you know what
[1:05:20] this pentecostal revival is going to
[1:05:22] change our body
[1:05:24] exactly this pentecostal revival is
[1:05:26] going to raise the dead
[1:05:28] and it's not going to raise the listen
[1:05:30] and we'll get to that maybe next sunday
[1:05:32] or
[1:05:32] a couple sundays from now there are
[1:05:35] brother dale's preaching the
[1:05:36] resurrection
[1:05:37] i'm preaching the resurrection now
[1:05:38] remember there are several types of
[1:05:40] resurrection
[1:05:43] lazarus was resurrected temporarily
[1:05:48] when when brother dale spoke to the um
[1:05:52] to randall several years ago
[1:05:55] and he came back from the dead that was
[1:05:57] temporary
[1:05:59] that wasn't the resurrection that was a
[1:06:02] resurrection
[1:06:03] because just this past year randall
[1:06:06] passed away
[1:06:07] physically okay but there
[1:06:10] jesus see there was a temporary
[1:06:12] resurrection when lazarus came forth
[1:06:14] because lazarus came out of the grave he
[1:06:17] was changed
[1:06:21] he had to be changed because the bible
[1:06:23] says he stinketh
[1:06:27] it wasn't cause he didn't have a bath he
[1:06:28] was dead for four days in that
[1:06:30] 90-something degree
[1:06:31] humid weather brother brown said and you
[1:06:34] know
[1:06:35] martha said he stinks lord he had to
[1:06:38] have a
[1:06:38] some kind of a change that's right but
[1:06:41] now remember if it when he came out of
[1:06:43] the grave though
[1:06:45] he continued on to an old age and he
[1:06:47] passed away
[1:06:48] right right temporary resurrection
[1:06:52] also there's a resurrection from out of
[1:06:54] dead words there's an
[1:06:55] out resurrection in the bible we'll
[1:06:57] cover that later on
[1:06:59] that paul says i want to be in that
[1:07:01] resurrection why he wants to he
[1:07:03] listen if you're not resurrected today
[1:07:05] by the new birth sitting in heavenly
[1:07:07] places
[1:07:07] you can forget about the first
[1:07:08] resurrection right that's right
[1:07:11] because you're not going to make it now
[1:07:13] you'll make the second one
[1:07:15] but you'll never make the first one
[1:07:17] right
[1:07:20] so now listen
[1:07:25] in these two excuse me these two
[1:07:28] messages
[1:07:30] two things two things one
[1:07:34] and two see one and two one
[1:07:38] it was temporary resurrection
[1:07:45] right because there was a healing
[1:07:46] campaign there was people resurrected
[1:07:49] from the dead
[1:07:50] right number one according to mankind
[1:07:53] for you turn the hearts
[1:07:54] of the children to the father's children
[1:07:56] what children to the fathers were
[1:07:59] where paul and all the different ones
[1:08:01] man they had resurrections everywhere
[1:08:03] peter and different ones and
[1:08:04] they'd lay their hands on them or even
[1:08:06] some people you know would be in the
[1:08:08] shadow of peter
[1:08:10] and get healed anytime you get healed
[1:08:13] that's a temporary resurrection
[1:08:15] because you were dying you were dead
[1:08:20] according to the world
[1:08:23] but alive in jesus christ if you're born
[1:08:25] again but this first one according to
[1:08:27] malachi 4 turned the hearts of the
[1:08:29] children to the fathers
[1:08:31] now remember the first part of his
[1:08:32] message was a healing campaign right
[1:08:34] right from 47 to 63
[1:08:38] remember we got all the quotes you've
[1:08:39] heard him that he said it's not in the
[1:08:41] years of preparation
[1:08:45] but now remember you can't throw it away
[1:08:46] because he said it was preparation
[1:08:48] okay it was preparation it was preparing
[1:08:51] you for something
[1:08:52] the problem was is people got blinded
[1:08:54] during that preparation time
[1:08:57] and thought that brother branham was the
[1:08:58] son of man or he was god and he was this
[1:09:00] and that and the other
[1:09:01] yeah but they totally missed number two
[1:09:05] because number two
[1:09:07] has the resurrection in it that you'll
[1:09:09] never die again
[1:09:14] one temporary resurrection
[1:09:18] everybody understand what i'm saying nod
[1:09:21] your head or don't bat you out you'll
[1:09:22] fall asleep
[1:09:27] according to malcolm 4 he'll turn the
[1:09:28] hearts of the children to the fathers
[1:09:29] what
[1:09:30] miracles miracles happen in the old
[1:09:32] testament
[1:09:33] i mean in the first part of the church
[1:09:35] age at church age number one
[1:09:37] acts is full of miracles book of acts
[1:09:40] but now remember brother branham said
[1:09:41] that he
[1:09:42] in one of his services there was more
[1:09:44] healing
[1:09:45] than what was in jesus whole life that's
[1:09:48] saying something
[1:09:49] that's right when you got 200 something
[1:09:51] thousand outstanding miracles
[1:09:53] in one service in india i'm just telling
[1:09:56] you what he said
[1:09:58] and jesus probably never had that many
[1:09:59] in his three and a half year message
[1:10:03] so you see what we had we had we had a
[1:10:06] preparation
[1:10:07] time that no one has ever had before
[1:10:12] god prepared us through william branham
[1:10:14] showing
[1:10:15] and you know how many of and i do i love
[1:10:18] to put on a tape and then get to the end
[1:10:22] and have the prayer line
[1:10:25] but which one was more important right
[1:10:28] right
[1:10:30] the parts you skip
[1:10:34] and i do enjoy you know somebody did a
[1:10:35] compilation of just
[1:10:37] just just the prayer lines and that's
[1:10:39] good because it helps you build faith
[1:10:41] but listen if it just if it just shows
[1:10:42] me that william branham did these things
[1:10:44] then it's just a waste of time right
[1:10:47] right
[1:10:48] right yeah it's a waste of time because
[1:10:50] it's doing you no good you're filling up
[1:10:52] time you're just listening to something
[1:10:53] that
[1:10:53] happened 50 years 60 years ago
[1:10:58] but when you say god that's you speaking
[1:11:00] to me
[1:11:01] i want the same thing i want the same
[1:11:04] thing those people were under
[1:11:06] because we get both of these right
[1:11:09] they didn't catch number two folks
[1:11:13] on the sixth seal brother brown said
[1:11:14] it's gone from you what's gone from them
[1:11:17] number two everybody with me
[1:11:22] they got this but they perverted it
[1:11:26] brother brown being god brother remember
[1:11:28] the son of man brother around this
[1:11:30] and listen some of them i don't blame
[1:11:32] because
[1:11:33] those people that spent time with
[1:11:34] brother branham day in and day out
[1:11:36] and you see things happen and and he'd
[1:11:39] say don't go over there there's going to
[1:11:40] be a snake over there under that
[1:11:43] or don't you know do this and don't do
[1:11:44] that hey there's some game over there on
[1:11:46] ridge number two and then it all just
[1:11:48] comes to pass
[1:11:49] never is it well this might happen
[1:11:54] he tells them exactly what's going to
[1:11:56] happen and it happens
[1:12:03] but that was to get their attention
[1:12:09] to the real message that was coming
[1:12:13] and he was trying for all those years to
[1:12:15] get their attention
[1:12:17] to the message that was coming because
[1:12:18] he knew the message was coming
[1:12:20] and when he got to the seals he said not
[1:12:22] in the years of preparation
[1:12:25] hey listen folks we're going to read it
[1:12:27] here in just a minute
[1:12:29] or maybe we won't but do you know
[1:12:33] william branham stood one day
[1:12:37] and preached the indictment
[1:12:44] he indicted a whole generation of people
[1:12:50] in other words he brought a charge
[1:12:53] against the whole denominational world
[1:12:56] at that moment
[1:13:00] now that's close to being god almighty
[1:13:04] but listen that was god almighty
[1:13:05] speaking through him
[1:13:08] because he said i indict this generation
[1:13:13] he's trying to preach a resurrection
[1:13:15] message
[1:13:17] a message with resurrection and rapture
[1:13:20] in it
[1:13:22] and they're putting jesus back on the
[1:13:24] cross again
[1:13:28] and he he had all his kids down
[1:13:34] god had all he could stand he knew him
[1:13:36] god was going to have to do that because
[1:13:37] a man can't indict a generation
[1:13:40] but god threw a man could stand up one
[1:13:43] day and said i
[1:13:44] indict this whole generation for the
[1:13:46] second crucifixion of jesus christ in
[1:13:48] other words i'm trying to preach you the
[1:13:49] resurrection
[1:13:50] and you're trying to put that same
[1:13:52] resurrected lord jesus that's still
[1:13:53] alive and well tonight
[1:13:55] you're putting him back on the cross to
[1:13:58] crucify him again
[1:14:02] and you know what the bible said it
[1:14:03] would happen
[1:14:05] let's read number three feast of the
[1:14:07] trumpet
[1:14:11] so remember with number one
[1:14:14] message that the prophet brought
[1:14:18] there was temporary resurrection
[1:14:22] because the sick was healed the dead was
[1:14:24] raised
[1:14:25] and even into the second one but his
[1:14:27] message was in that second part
[1:14:29] that would literally turn us back that's
[1:14:32] literally going to change our body to
[1:14:33] where we're going
[1:14:34] we're not going to have a
[1:14:37] raisin from the dead one day and die the
[1:14:39] next
[1:14:41] folks there's got to be somebody that
[1:14:42] takes this message and says i'm not
[1:14:44] going to die
[1:14:48] and it can only be by the son of man not
[1:14:51] the son of god
[1:14:54] son of man's already died one time he
[1:14:56] don't have to die again
[1:14:58] if i got it now listen let's look at
[1:14:59] number three feast of the trumpets
[1:15:02] now he's been revealed through the
[1:15:03] church ages now watch through the church
[1:15:05] ages
[1:15:06] as son of god god being a spirit
[1:15:10] the holy spirit he revealed himself in
[1:15:12] the church ages as in the congregation
[1:15:15] as the holy spirit among the people
[1:15:19] listen they were spirit-filled people
[1:15:20] they were god's
[1:15:22] bride for that time they were born again
[1:15:26] just as born again as you are
[1:15:28] they just didn't have enough word to
[1:15:30] carry them on through
[1:15:32] they didn't have a prophet on the scene
[1:15:35] they had reformers
[1:15:37] didn't have a prophet luther was a
[1:15:38] reformer wesley was a reformer
[1:15:40] we find and allow to sin church age the
[1:15:43] last church age
[1:15:44] he is put out of the church nowhere else
[1:15:47] was he ever put out in other words
[1:15:49] crucifying him again but in the loudest
[1:15:52] in age because they said we're rich and
[1:15:53] have need of nothing
[1:15:56] and know it not that you're miserable
[1:15:57] poor and naked blind and don't know it
[1:15:59] he was put
[1:15:59] out of the church age this church age
[1:16:04] and then according to luke 17 he said as
[1:16:06] it was in the days of sodom
[1:16:08] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:16:10] of man now he was reading the same
[1:16:12] genesis
[1:16:13] that we read notice that sodom what had
[1:16:16] taken place
[1:16:17] let's go to number four this is one i
[1:16:19] think brother dale read this morning
[1:16:20] queen of sheba
[1:16:22] jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:16:23] sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:16:25] the son of man
[1:16:26] look at that angel down there to the
[1:16:28] church elect to what he'd done look at
[1:16:29] jesus what he'd done in his generation
[1:16:32] look down here at this generation what
[1:16:35] he's doing now
[1:16:36] look they'll receive a sign it's like
[1:16:38] brother dale said they'll receive a sign
[1:16:40] but they won't believe it
[1:16:44] they're going to get it because the
[1:16:45] bible says they're going to get this
[1:16:47] sign that's what it means by receiving
[1:16:49] it
[1:16:49] but listen they're not going to make it
[1:16:52] they're not going to act on it
[1:16:54] right they're going to say it's false
[1:16:56] they're going to hang him back up on the
[1:16:57] cross again
[1:16:59] there you are but it comes just the same
[1:17:01] an evil
[1:17:02] and adulterous generation will seek
[1:17:04] after a sign
[1:17:05] and they'll have it it'll be given to
[1:17:08] them
[1:17:09] as jonah was in the belly of the well
[1:17:11] three days and night so the son of man
[1:17:12] will be in the heart of the earth three
[1:17:13] days and nights
[1:17:14] but the resurrection will be the sign
[1:17:18] and the resurrection sign is given to
[1:17:21] the church in this last days
[1:17:25] not the resurrection sign temporary he's
[1:17:27] talking about the resurrection to get
[1:17:29] the dead saints out of the ground
[1:17:31] amen the angel of the holy spirit in the
[1:17:35] meetings
[1:17:36] showing the same thing doing the same
[1:17:38] thing across the nation
[1:17:40] proving that jesus christ is raised from
[1:17:42] the dead just the same yesterday today
[1:17:44] and forever
[1:17:45] that's the generation that will receive
[1:17:48] it
[1:17:49] and that's why you read the scripture
[1:17:51] who shall declare this generation listen
[1:17:52] there's generation that declared
[1:17:54] luther's message there's a generation
[1:17:56] that declared wesley's message but this
[1:17:58] generation is declaring the what message
[1:18:01] the message of the son of man to not
[1:18:03] just declare it but to
[1:18:04] what be it that's the generation
[1:18:09] that will receive it
[1:18:14] that's me and you listen even job in 14
[1:18:16] 12
[1:18:17] so man lies down and rises not till the
[1:18:20] heavens be no more
[1:18:21] they shall not await nor be raised out
[1:18:23] of their sleep oh that thou would has
[1:18:25] hide me
[1:18:26] in the grave that thou would just keep
[1:18:27] me secret until the wrath be passed
[1:18:29] that thou would have to point me a set
[1:18:31] time and remember me
[1:18:33] if a man dies shall he live again all
[1:18:35] the days of my appointed time will i
[1:18:37] wait
[1:18:38] till my change comes boy he he knew
[1:18:41] something there didn't he
[1:18:43] even in the old testament thou shalt
[1:18:45] call and i will answer thee
[1:18:47] thou will have a desire of the work of
[1:18:50] thy hands
[1:18:52] let's read this if everything's based on
[1:18:54] resurrection let's read this definition
[1:18:57] of resurrection resurrection is a state
[1:19:00] of having passed
[1:19:01] completely through death and having
[1:19:05] risen from death
[1:19:08] now look completely passed through death
[1:19:13] and resurrected from death
[1:19:16] to be in resurrection is different than
[1:19:19] to be alive
[1:19:20] right to be alive is the original state
[1:19:23] now i want you to look at that word
[1:19:25] alive
[1:19:27] because paul says down here a little bit
[1:19:29] further we're probably not going to get
[1:19:30] to it
[1:19:31] he says those who are alive
[1:19:36] and remain to be alive
[1:19:40] is the original state without having the
[1:19:42] past having passed through death
[1:19:44] to be in resurrection is to have passed
[1:19:46] through death
[1:19:47] and have been raised up right right
[1:19:51] now that's where we got to get into the
[1:19:53] separate resurrections and we don't have
[1:19:54] time to do that it's almost 3 30.
[1:19:56] because you can have a temporary
[1:19:58] resurrection and you can die again like
[1:20:00] i said before
[1:20:02] if you have been born again this
[1:20:04] afternoon
[1:20:05] you've already been resurrected sitting
[1:20:07] in heavenly places your soul is eternal
[1:20:09] as god is as
[1:20:10] eternal as it ever will be waiting on
[1:20:13] the body
[1:20:14] this is the body the son of man
[1:20:17] literally his body went in the ground
[1:20:20] can't kill the son of god though that's
[1:20:21] what went to hell preached to the souls
[1:20:24] in prison
[1:20:25] you were with him but resurrection is a
[1:20:29] state of having passed completely
[1:20:30] through death
[1:20:31] and having risen from death now remember
[1:20:36] if you're a christian you can't die
[1:20:40] you can physically go but but once
[1:20:43] you're born again
[1:20:46] you can't die let's read first
[1:20:48] corinthians 15 verse 12.
[1:20:51] i like this scripture it wasn't one that
[1:20:53] i had the other day let's read this just
[1:20:54] for a moment first corinthians
[1:20:56] which is based on resurrection there you
[1:20:58] go now if christ be preached now watch
[1:21:00] this
[1:21:01] he's preaching to corinthians now if
[1:21:04] christ be preached that he rose from the
[1:21:06] dead
[1:21:07] how say some among you that there is no
[1:21:10] resurrection of the dead as brother
[1:21:11] dale's talking about the sadducees and
[1:21:13] the different ones
[1:21:14] but if there be no resurrection of the
[1:21:17] dead
[1:21:18] then is christ not risen
[1:21:24] read that but if there be no
[1:21:27] resurrection
[1:21:28] of the dead then is christ's not risen
[1:21:30] look
[1:21:31] and if if christ be not risen
[1:21:34] then is our preaching vain
[1:21:39] if jesus christ didn't raise from the
[1:21:40] dead folks what are we preaching
[1:21:42] amen a dead god that we don't know where
[1:21:46] he's at
[1:21:46] he's still in the tomb that's why
[1:21:48] brother brown makes all that different
[1:21:49] analogy about muhammad
[1:21:51] and buddha and all them he said their
[1:21:53] tomb's not empty he said we serve a god
[1:21:55] that the tomb is empty
[1:21:58] and if christ be not risen then is our
[1:22:00] preaching vain and your
[1:22:02] faith is also vain whatever you believe
[1:22:05] in is vanity if you don't believe that
[1:22:08] jesus christ resurrected from the dead
[1:22:11] and not only that he resurrected from
[1:22:13] the dead but he came back inside of me
[1:22:15] in you
[1:22:18] listen to first corinthians 15 verse 20
[1:22:22] but now now he's continuing his thought
[1:22:24] from first corinthians 15 12 to first
[1:22:25] corinthians 15 20.
[1:22:27] but now has christ risen from the dead
[1:22:30] and become the first fruits of them that
[1:22:32] slept
[1:22:33] for since by man came death by man came
[1:22:36] also the resurrection of the dead glory
[1:22:40] son of man came to resurrection of the
[1:22:44] dead
[1:22:45] amen for as in adam all die
[1:22:48] even so in christ shall all be made
[1:22:52] alive but every man in his own order
[1:22:56] church ages christ the first fruits
[1:22:59] afterwards they that are christ
[1:23:01] at his coming now what coming are we
[1:23:06] looking for
[1:23:09] he's already here by what the prophet's
[1:23:11] already told us
[1:23:13] so revelations 20 verse 4 talks about
[1:23:16] the first resurrection
[1:23:18] go down to the bottom we know this but
[1:23:20] the rest of the dead live not again
[1:23:22] until the thousand years were finished
[1:23:23] this is the first resurrection
[1:23:25] that's us the dead saints anybody that's
[1:23:27] died and with the baptism of the holy
[1:23:28] ghost they're going to raise in the
[1:23:29] first resurrection
[1:23:31] there was a question somebody asked me
[1:23:32] online and about the
[1:23:36] people in in the old testament well
[1:23:39] people in the old testament can't come
[1:23:40] up in the first resurrection
[1:23:42] none of them can
[1:23:47] first resurrection is just for the bride
[1:23:50] it's just for the bride no one else this
[1:23:52] is not this
[1:23:53] and i'm sorry if you if you just need to
[1:23:55] be bribed
[1:23:57] and if you're bribed then it's not gonna
[1:23:59] hurt your feelings
[1:24:01] but if your mama brother sister mother
[1:24:03] and all them other people ain't born
[1:24:04] again they ain't coming up in the first
[1:24:05] resurrection
[1:24:06] i don't care who they are the first
[1:24:09] resurrection is he
[1:24:10] alone for the dead in christ shall rise
[1:24:13] first
[1:24:14] amen that's for the people that took
[1:24:17] that genesis 1 26 and held it
[1:24:21] this is the first resurrection blessed
[1:24:23] and holy
[1:24:26] it's he that has pardoned the first
[1:24:28] resurrection
[1:24:31] on such the second death hath no power
[1:24:34] what is the second death
[1:24:37] listen if you're dead in christ you're
[1:24:38] already dead you don't have to die again
[1:24:42] but now do you know though that somebody
[1:24:44] that's a sinner if he dies
[1:24:46] he goes into the fifth dimension and
[1:24:48] he's got to be resurrected
[1:24:50] in that same condition at the second
[1:24:53] resurrection
[1:24:54] and then he's gonna die again
[1:24:59] eventually he's going to just go away
[1:25:02] right
[1:25:03] but not a christian we die in christ
[1:25:06] we're already dead to the world sure we
[1:25:09] might have to go to sleep
[1:25:11] that's what the bible says sleep
[1:25:14] on such the second death hath no power
[1:25:17] but they shall be priests of god and of
[1:25:19] christ and shall reign with him
[1:25:21] for one thousand years first
[1:25:24] thessalonians 4
[1:25:25] 13 real quick these are all scriptures
[1:25:29] and i think i read some of them last
[1:25:30] week
[1:25:32] first corinthians 4 verse 13 says but i
[1:25:34] would not have you to be ignorant
[1:25:36] brethren concerning them which are
[1:25:37] what dead no sleep that you saw not even
[1:25:41] as others which have no hope
[1:25:43] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:25:45] rose again even so
[1:25:47] them also which sleep in jesus will god
[1:25:51] bring with him for this we say unto you
[1:25:54] by the word of the lord
[1:25:56] that we which are alive
[1:25:59] i just read you that a minute ago if
[1:26:01] you're alive you're not
[1:26:03] you don't need to be resurrected
[1:26:04] physically you're alive
[1:26:08] if we are alive and remain unto the
[1:26:10] coming of the lord shall not prevent
[1:26:12] them which
[1:26:12] are asleep now right here
[1:26:16] is where
[1:26:20] it took a prophet
[1:26:24] to finish this
[1:26:27] shout out listen how many of you
[1:26:31] have heard denominational boy when that
[1:26:34] trumpet sounds
[1:26:36] yo when that loud voice hey
[1:26:41] the shout it took a prophet
[1:26:46] to tell us that the lord descended from
[1:26:49] heaven with a shout
[1:26:51] because see they're thinking this is all
[1:26:53] going to happen and it's going to be
[1:26:55] everybody's going to see it it's going
[1:26:58] to be everybody's going to notice me
[1:27:00] resurrecting oh no oh no no no
[1:27:05] it's gonna be so secret listen folks
[1:27:08] them them graves are not gonna be
[1:27:10] messed up you know i'm gonna run out
[1:27:13] there and say
[1:27:14] oh man richard marlowe didn't make it
[1:27:21] ray gabriel didn't make it their graves
[1:27:23] are still closed up
[1:27:24] that don't matter they walk through the
[1:27:28] wall to get out of here they can walk
[1:27:29] back through dirt to get up here
[1:27:33] that's my god that's my part of
[1:27:36] resurrection
[1:27:38] that's it but listen
[1:27:42] all those that went home to be with the
[1:27:45] lord
[1:27:48] they heard the shout out
[1:27:52] and they knew what it was because they
[1:27:53] had a prophet tell them what that shout
[1:27:55] was
[1:27:55] that's right
[1:27:59] the voice of the archangel they heard
[1:28:02] that
[1:28:06] we're waiting on this right here
[1:28:10] that's a message to get them out of the
[1:28:13] ground
[1:28:15] because see after the three and the dead
[1:28:18] in christ
[1:28:19] shall rise first
[1:28:22] and right the dead in christ
[1:28:26] you say oh now you said they weren't
[1:28:27] dead no they died before they
[1:28:29] fell asleep this is dead in christ this
[1:28:33] is that you're dead in christ today by
[1:28:35] the new birth
[1:28:36] you didn't go to a grave dead in christ
[1:28:40] you died in christ and you just fell
[1:28:42] asleep because of some issue
[1:28:46] sickness in the body no shame in that
[1:28:49] listen
[1:28:49] we say well it's just real bad well it
[1:28:51] is it's a bad separation but my
[1:28:54] would you want to bring any of the folks
[1:28:55] back
[1:28:57] no unless they all come back together
[1:29:03] and here's it again brother john then we
[1:29:05] which are
[1:29:07] alive and remain
[1:29:10] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:29:13] the clouds to meet the lord
[1:29:15] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[1:29:16] the lord look wherefore
[1:29:18] comfort one another we had a prophet of
[1:29:21] god
[1:29:22] comfort us
[1:29:25] to tell us where they're at and that
[1:29:28] they fell asleep under the voice
[1:29:32] of almighty god they fell asleep under
[1:29:35] the voice of the resurrection
[1:29:39] because that's what's going to bring
[1:29:40] them out of the ground
[1:29:45] first thessalonians i mean first
[1:29:48] corinthians let's read this and then
[1:29:49] we'll be done
[1:29:52] 15 47 first man is the earth earthy
[1:29:56] the second man is the lord from heaven
[1:29:58] as is the earthy
[1:29:59] such they also that are earthy and as is
[1:30:03] the heavenly such as they
[1:30:05] also that are heavenly and as we have
[1:30:07] borne the image of the earthy
[1:30:09] we shall also bear the image of the
[1:30:11] heavenly now how we're going to do that
[1:30:13] by the new birth
[1:30:16] because that's where genesis 1 26 come
[1:30:18] from they come from eternity it comes
[1:30:21] from heaven
[1:30:22] amen and as we have borne the image of
[1:30:25] the earthy we also shall bear the image
[1:30:26] of the heavenly now this i say brethren
[1:30:29] that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[1:30:31] kingdom of god well brother you just
[1:30:32] said
[1:30:33] yeah we're going to be changed but our
[1:30:36] flesh and blood at this moment can't do
[1:30:38] that
[1:30:39] exactly right that's why we have graves
[1:30:42] it's when we have places that we put
[1:30:43] this corrupt body
[1:30:45] because corruption doesn't inherit
[1:30:48] incorruption
[1:30:50] behold
[1:30:53] he didn't stop there and say oh that's
[1:30:55] it we're done
[1:30:56] you're you're just there's nothing i
[1:30:58] don't know
[1:30:59] i don't know what's gonna it first
[1:31:01] second
[1:31:03] um what was that left behind where you
[1:31:05] can get saved maybe afterwards and
[1:31:08] we don't live under that folks
[1:31:12] we live under the word of god as plain
[1:31:14] as it is we know what's
[1:31:16] going on we know what's going to happen
[1:31:18] behold i
[1:31:19] show you one mystery
[1:31:23] revelation 10 7 says i'm going to show
[1:31:26] you
[1:31:27] one mystery now
[1:31:31] there's a difference in this and what
[1:31:34] we're
[1:31:34] living under today this is a prophecy
[1:31:41] what we're living under is a reality
[1:31:44] remember i said literal is not a type
[1:31:49] this is the type because paul is saying
[1:31:52] we shall not all we shall all be changed
[1:31:54] now that's not that didn't happen in his
[1:31:55] time
[1:31:56] we shall not all sleep that night didn't
[1:31:57] happen in his time that's a prophecy
[1:32:00] he was looking at the future knowing
[1:32:03] there was something coming but now
[1:32:04] brother branham reads this scripture and
[1:32:06] he says hey
[1:32:07] i'm not saying he's coming i'm saying
[1:32:09] he's here
[1:32:10] and the resurrection has begun already
[1:32:15] because he showed all the temporary
[1:32:17] resurrections during the time of his
[1:32:18] ministry
[1:32:20] and now we're looking at the full
[1:32:22] resurrection what
[1:32:24] behold i show you one mystery
[1:32:28] the son of man is on the scene
[1:32:33] the son of man messages on the scene the
[1:32:36] resurrection is on the scene
[1:32:38] brother brown even tells us the
[1:32:39] resurrection's inside of you why go look
[1:32:41] for it somewhere else
[1:32:43] we shall not all sleep
[1:32:46] but we shall all be changed
[1:32:50] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:32:52] at the last trump there's that trump
[1:32:54] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[1:32:57] shall be raised incorruptible
[1:33:00] and we shall be changed
[1:33:03] for this corruptible must put on
[1:33:05] incorruption
[1:33:07] that's why it's called a change this is
[1:33:09] not going to meet god
[1:33:10] in the condition it's in
[1:33:13] can't for this corruption we must put on
[1:33:16] incorruption and this mortal
[1:33:18] must put on immortality so when this
[1:33:20] corruptable shall have put on
[1:33:21] incorruption
[1:33:22] he's prophesying and this mortal shall
[1:33:24] have put on immortality then shall be
[1:33:25] brought to
[1:33:26] pass the saying that is written death is
[1:33:29] swallowed up in victory you know that's
[1:33:30] in the old testament
[1:33:33] that's why paul's quoting it because
[1:33:34] that's in the old testament
[1:33:36] o death whereas thy sting o grave
[1:33:38] where's thy victory
[1:33:39] the sting of death is sin and the stink
[1:33:41] strength of sin is the law
[1:33:43] but thanks be to god which giveth us
[1:33:46] the victory through our lord jesus
[1:33:48] christ
[1:33:51] let me read romans skip john 11. we're
[1:33:53] going to read romans
[1:33:54] 6 verse 4 and we'll finish right here
[1:33:59] listen to this therefore we are buried
[1:34:01] with him by baptism
[1:34:03] and to death that like as christ was
[1:34:05] raised up from the dead by the glory of
[1:34:07] the father even so we also should walk
[1:34:09] in newness of life
[1:34:11] this we read this when we do our baptism
[1:34:13] because that what is a baptism
[1:34:15] a baptism shows you made a confession
[1:34:18] that
[1:34:19] the old you wanted to die
[1:34:22] i'm tired of this living like i'm living
[1:34:24] living
[1:34:27] right i'm tired of this living i want to
[1:34:31] death burial
[1:34:34] resurrection and newness of life see
[1:34:36] there's another resurrection that's a
[1:34:38] type
[1:34:40] everything types resurrection hey even
[1:34:42] even this in
[1:34:43] april what what happened in april the
[1:34:45] whole world had a resurrection
[1:34:49] stuff started blooming stuff started
[1:34:50] changing colors leaves went on trees
[1:34:52] that there wasn't any buds
[1:34:54] it was just buds at one time and and
[1:34:57] resurrections all around us folks
[1:35:01] you know your body regenerates itself
[1:35:02] already and even in a fallen condition
[1:35:04] your body does regenerate itself
[1:35:06] why do you keep i mean are we living
[1:35:08] we're still alive
[1:35:10] therefore we are buried with him by
[1:35:11] baptism into death
[1:35:13] that's why i don't want baptism to be
[1:35:17] a ritual you see other people make it a
[1:35:20] ritual
[1:35:22] the catholic church make it a ritual
[1:35:24] that if that baby doesn't have
[1:35:26] infant baptism you know that the baby's
[1:35:28] going that person goes to hell
[1:35:30] yeah read your roman catholics that's
[1:35:32] why they're so adamant about taking that
[1:35:34] little baby and having it
[1:35:36] uh what do you call it i
[1:35:39] they sprinkle it over but it's called
[1:35:41] something it's infant baptism what it is
[1:35:43] but if they don't do that that baby has
[1:35:46] no chance to go to heaven
[1:35:48] so the catholic church has to sprinkle
[1:35:49] it and do the infant baptism
[1:35:51] but we know better than that we know
[1:35:54] better than that
[1:35:55] but we also know better that we have put
[1:35:57] down a lot of people that had not died
[1:35:59] first
[1:36:05] because you baptize them and then you
[1:36:06] don't see them no more
[1:36:08] they didn't die they just wanted to go
[1:36:10] through a ritual
[1:36:12] that thought it would might help them
[1:36:14] when it probably hurt them worse
[1:36:17] because they denied the very thing that
[1:36:19] they went through
[1:36:20] that's why all this is serious folks
[1:36:22] it's just not i want to be baptized
[1:36:24] young people yeah okay but when you get
[1:36:26] older
[1:36:27] you ought to know that you you got to
[1:36:29] die first listen
[1:36:31] we've buried too many live people right
[1:36:35] life to their self but if you say god
[1:36:38] i've had enough of this i am
[1:36:40] dying out to everything i've done now i
[1:36:43] want to go be baptized and then we read
[1:36:44] the scripture for if we have been
[1:36:46] planted together
[1:36:47] planted in the likeness of his death
[1:36:51] we shall also in the lightness shall be
[1:36:53] in the likeness of his resurrection
[1:36:56] knowing this that our old man is
[1:36:59] crucified with him
[1:37:02] that the body of sin might be what
[1:37:05] destroyed i love that word
[1:37:08] you had a destruction not too long ago
[1:37:10] didn't you it just destroyed whatever
[1:37:12] that was that was
[1:37:13] bothering you that henceforth we should
[1:37:16] not
[1:37:17] serve sin for in that for he that is
[1:37:20] dead
[1:37:24] not literally like some of y'all looking
[1:37:30] for he that is dead is free from sin do
[1:37:31] you know if you if you're still alive
[1:37:33] see
[1:37:34] if you're the bride of christ and you're
[1:37:35] still alive
[1:37:37] you can't marry another husband you
[1:37:40] can't be married to the devil and be
[1:37:41] married to christ at the same time
[1:37:44] one of them's got to be dead right a
[1:37:47] sinner
[1:37:49] has this old husband but now if you'll
[1:37:52] say
[1:37:53] one day i want my whole husband to die i
[1:37:56] want a death to happen
[1:37:58] now for he that is dead is free from sin
[1:38:01] he that is dead
[1:38:02] is freed from marriage and divorce
[1:38:03] because you know what if you're if your
[1:38:05] wife or your husband dies you're free to
[1:38:07] marry right
[1:38:08] only in the lord but you are free to
[1:38:10] marry why because it had to be a type
[1:38:12] showing that you what were married to
[1:38:14] the devil
[1:38:16] at your birth first birth you were
[1:38:18] married to the devil
[1:38:20] and you stayed mad to him forever how
[1:38:21] long you got till you got sick of that
[1:38:23] person
[1:38:25] and then you wanted him dead not like
[1:38:27] brother brown said you can't hang him up
[1:38:29] in a closet that's not
[1:38:30] that's not killing that's not dying
[1:38:33] that's hanging him up so you can
[1:38:34] conveniently get him back out when you
[1:38:36] need him
[1:38:37] but if it's dead you don't see him no
[1:38:40] more
[1:38:42] that's why god told the children of
[1:38:44] israel he said those
[1:38:45] egyptians that you saw today what is the
[1:38:48] red sea
[1:38:49] death those egyptians you see today you
[1:38:53] will
[1:38:53] never see them no more in other words
[1:38:57] that group will never bother you again
[1:39:00] because they're what d-e-a-d
[1:39:03] right and listen if they're dead in
[1:39:06] anything but christ
[1:39:07] there is no resurrection except the
[1:39:08] second one
[1:39:10] now if we be dead with christ we believe
[1:39:14] that we shall
[1:39:15] also live with him so to live with
[1:39:18] christ you've got to be dead
[1:39:19] that's right that's right you got to be
[1:39:21] dead
[1:39:22] you got to be dead to live with christ
[1:39:24] listen he died
[1:39:26] to give you that that opportunity
[1:39:30] to be dead with him and to be dead with
[1:39:33] christ
[1:39:35] you're more alive than anybody in the
[1:39:36] whole on the whole face of the earth
[1:39:40] man i never forget let's stand our feet
[1:39:42] musicians come
[1:39:45] i can just see the prophet of god
[1:39:47] staying in that motel and
[1:39:49] wherever he was at he was telling the
[1:39:50] story how he was it was a commotion
[1:39:52] outside in the hallway and
[1:39:54] opened the door and there was you know
[1:39:55] those women they're dragging each other
[1:39:57] down the hallway now this is in the 60s
[1:39:59] or 50s
[1:40:00] they were partying let's just put it
[1:40:02] that way sorry they were partying

[1:40:08] and said bro you know i mean here they
[1:40:09] put god puts them right in front of a
[1:40:11] prophet

[1:40:18] having this party
[1:40:20] right and puts a woman
[1:40:23] in front of the prophet half-naked how
[1:40:26] many times has he told you about that
[1:40:27] right be in the church and what did that
[1:40:31] woman say
[1:40:32] whoopee this is life
[1:40:37] he said little did she know she was dead
[1:40:40] right
[1:40:43] and that's what he preached all through
[1:40:44] his whole time he said what you think's
[1:40:47] life
[1:40:49] is death so all the pleasures of the
[1:40:52] world everything that we see in the
[1:40:54] world
[1:40:55] it's all death right it's all temporary
[1:40:58] folks young kids it's all temporary
[1:41:01] anything that you got around here is
[1:41:03] temporary but if you'll get jesus christ
[1:41:05] in your heart
[1:41:08] you won't die anymore right all these
[1:41:11] little things i'll get persecuted i'll
[1:41:14] get
[1:41:16] there's a glory that comes past that
[1:41:19] there's a glory that comes
[1:41:21] from being dead to this world and not
[1:41:24] being conformed to the world
[1:41:26] you say well see it's just like this
[1:41:27] this age it's this age louise is this

[1:41:38] does it in his own time
[1:41:39] right right but you tell god you ask him
[1:41:43] to forgive your sins
[1:41:45] and then you go to that water and you
[1:41:47] say god i want to die
[1:41:49] and i want to be buried because i have
[1:41:53] a promise that if i die in christ
[1:41:56] i'll be resurrected glory not to just
[1:41:59] life
[1:42:00] mortal life immortal right
[1:42:04] by the baptism of holy ghost we move
[1:42:06] into
[1:42:07] a resurrection that there's no more
[1:42:09] death
[1:42:11] we die one time
[1:42:14] love the lord amen it's good to know
[1:42:17] this that we know
[1:42:18] right it's good to know this eternal
[1:42:21] plan of redemption because it covers you
[1:42:23] and listen folks if it's an eternal plan
[1:42:25] of redemption we're going to still be
[1:42:26] talking about this when
[1:42:27] when the rapture takes place in the
[1:42:29] thousand years of millennium and then we
[1:42:30] go into the future home and we go into
[1:42:32] the
[1:42:32] new city or the new city and and we go
[1:42:35] into all that
[1:42:36] we're still going to be talking about an
[1:42:37] eternal redemption

[1:42:41] and how all these things happened in
[1:42:43] your life

[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:48] the original
[1:47:50] [Music]
[1:47:54] now i want to ask you a question before
[1:47:56] we leave
[1:47:58] we now know who the son of man is no one
[1:48:01] understood the son of man when he was on
[1:48:03] earth
[1:48:04] no one understand understood fully the
[1:48:06] son of man in the church ages
[1:48:08] right we know that we see all that but
[1:48:11] now in the end time we
[1:48:12] understand the very character
[1:48:16] of that son of man amen
[1:48:19] glory that's it that's the character of
[1:48:23] the son of man because that's what he
[1:48:24] portrayed in human flesh
[1:48:27] is that statue of a perfect man he
[1:48:28] portrayed all those
[1:48:30] he was the headstone so he wasn't a type
[1:48:35] he was a literal person but now i want
[1:48:38] to ask you a question
[1:48:40] are we a type
[1:48:46] that's not the faith of jesus christ
[1:48:48] made into the faith of wade dale or the
[1:48:50] faith of wade dale made in the faith of
[1:48:51] jesus christ
[1:48:53] that is the faith of jesus christ i've
[1:48:55] got to put myself in there and make
[1:48:57] myself available for that
[1:49:00] ad listen peter didn't say
[1:49:03] get your preacher to add
[1:49:10] he stood up and said add to your faith
[1:49:13] [Music]
[1:49:16] add to your faith virtue and to your
[1:49:20] virtue you add knowledge you it's an
[1:49:22] individual affair with god
[1:49:23] that's right you had it you've got to do
[1:49:27] it you've got something to do with this
[1:49:30] and it's the son of man now i see the
[1:49:32] son of man we shake hands with the son
[1:49:35] of man we hug the son of man
[1:49:36] we speak to the son of man and your
[1:49:38] sisters yes you are included in that too
[1:49:40] but we don't hug you in all those things
[1:49:41] you understand
[1:49:43] but this is the son of man we're looking
[1:49:45] at now if you have that revelation
[1:49:47] listen there's a lot of people stuck in
[1:49:50] the son of god revelation
[1:49:55] amen if you're stuck in the son of god
[1:49:58] revelation you're not going to take a
[1:49:59] body change
[1:50:01] you might have to pass away and then
[1:50:03] take a body change
[1:50:05] because that's what's going to cleanse
[1:50:06] you because we plant you in corruption
[1:50:08] and raise you in incorruption but why
[1:50:10] can't we believe
[1:50:12] that the prophet of god told us one time
[1:50:13] and i think i'll try to find that quote
[1:50:15] that corruption met its master
[1:50:18] at the tomb of lazarus corruption now
[1:50:21] who
[1:50:22] was standing at the tomb of lazarus
[1:50:26] the son of man
[1:50:29] and the son of man said i am the
[1:50:31] resurrection and the life
[1:50:33] and today in the end time where is that
[1:50:36] son of man
[1:50:37] he's in me and you he is portraying
[1:50:41] in me and you exactly the same jesus
[1:50:44] i'll read you a quote
[1:50:45] next sunday or a couple of sundays where
[1:50:47] brother brown said if we can get the
[1:50:49] same message of jesus christ here
[1:50:51] he said there will be a resurrection
[1:50:55] he said bro wait i think we got it here
[1:50:57] yeah it's here but there's little pieces
[1:50:59] that are missing
[1:51:00] right i said little
[1:51:03] teeny pieces that are missing to this
[1:51:05] puzzle
[1:51:06] it may be that you need to get born
[1:51:08] again it may need
[1:51:10] then i need to get born again it may
[1:51:12] need may mean that we need to get out
[1:51:14] from right here and get on up here
[1:51:16] hey man but everything is here
[1:51:20] for us to get out of here with look
[1:51:22] there's no other message there's no
[1:51:23] other messenger
[1:51:24] there's no other body of christ that's
[1:51:26] going to raise up somewhere else
[1:51:28] this is the generation that's going to
[1:51:30] declare right
[1:51:32] the resurrection and it's not going to
[1:51:34] be to the world
[1:51:35] that's right it's secret yes right
[1:51:39] i mean honestly folks take this message
[1:51:41] this morning
[1:51:42] and this message this afternoon and play
[1:51:45] it to people 90
[1:51:46] of the people of the world they will not
[1:51:49] know what you're talking about
[1:51:50] that's right i mean play it to the
[1:51:53] copelands and play it today they'll you
[1:51:55] know what they'll say oh you're quoting
[1:51:56] that brandon man
[1:51:57] no i ain't quoting the brown of man i'm
[1:52:00] quoting jesus christ
[1:52:02] man amen he's the son of man he's the
[1:52:05] only the son of man william brown was
[1:52:07] not he was a part of it
[1:52:08] he introduced us isn't that what
[1:52:12] isn't that what john did he introduced
[1:52:16] the messiah
[1:52:18] brother branham introduced us to the
[1:52:20] messiah that we need for the end time
[1:52:24] see they didn't need him in luther's day
[1:52:26] as as much full
[1:52:27] because there was no resurrection but
[1:52:29] according to luke 17
