a little slotow tonight just because um at towards the end I want to give a little missions report so that's the reason why why I brought my handy little laptop today and uh so let's uh let's turn to the scriptures or you can read along with me I don't know if you can see that but uh we want to read from Genesis chapter 3 Genesis chapter 3 and uh here in verse one and it says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God hath made and he said unto the woman yay hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree and notice uh he the serpent saying he said unto the woman yay hath God said amen God had already said something right his voice is had has already gone forth right but then at Satan what he likes to do is he likes to copy anything that God does he just does it he has no original thought he has no word of his own amen he takes the word of God it perverts it and then he says something with it right and so and he said unto the woman yeah hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest you die and that's what he said but now watch the serpent has his own thing to say to it and the serpent said unto the woman said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth not know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made them M themselves aprons verse 8 it says and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and notice that this voice was walking amen it was a living voice amen it was a it was a person right it wasn't just any any old voice amen it was not anything dead or anything without substance it was God himself the one that said let there be light and there was light is the same voice that walking through the garden asking and seeking Adam Adam Where Art Thou amen not that he didn't know where he was but that he knew exactly where he was he just wanted to make sure that Adam knew where he was at and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife this is verse 17 and unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wives you see when you were hearkening unto my voice you didn't have these issues but now because you've hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt thou eat uh of it all the days of thy life okay all right you may be seated this evening praise the Lord amen this evening I want to talk about but in the days of the voice amen how many how many believe we're living in that day amen in the days of the voice and and and and it should be that we are we are that voice amen again as we were just reading that voice should be something active something alive something something something present amen not not some dead voice amen but something alive and that's the reason why it's so important amen that we take uh it's not it's not just about just the the the the the tapes amen which we we listen to the tapes we we we love that voice right but it wasn't really brother Brandon bringing out the things that he said in there it was God through the prophet bringing out those things and so because it was God through the prophet amen that's the reason why that voice still lives amen praise God because it wasn't brother branham's word it was the voice of God through brother brandham therefore amen we must receive that voice of our own amen and go and and walk with that voice amen that voice must be part of our Lives amen not just on a on a tape you see the reason why there's some people that say well just just the tapes only just the tapes only and that's it and and brother Brandon had had the had the word and we must amen but that voice has to live in this hour amen that word that message that brother Brandon brought amen it was to be a living message not not not a not a message on on on tapes and and on CD players and on MP3s amen because those things are not going in a rapture amen you're your mp3 player and your car stereo amen is not going in a Rapture amen but you are amen when you have that same voice amen uh uh speaking through you praise God yes sir amen so kind of getting ahead of myself praise the Lord now we're living in an age amen where we have so many voices and I have a different different voices here that we have that we're bombarded with on every corner amen we have social media voices platforms like Instagram and Twitter constantly flood us with information opinions and comparisons it's where people go and compare themselves a lot of times amen and if I'm not as good as this family is well we got to do better we got to do something about that because our pictures need to look right amen yeah our our our images need to need to need to look good for the fall everybody needs to be dressed a certain way we need to make sure that we look better than the other family right so so those are the voices that we receive amen that that cause us sometimes to to look more to that amen and it becomes a competition right brother that's it amen it becomes a competition sometimes rather than just something for us to just maybe enjoy and and and and and so so social media is a voice out there we also have the the the the the voice of news Amen in this hour we see news the news is just we're bombarded with 24/7 news Cycles a with global events negativity and all they do is leave us feeling anxious and overwhelmed amen there is no there there's not that much happy news anymore it's all negative amen why because it shock value amen brings them profits amen they're not going to talk about the good old lady down the street amen who who gave who did something good for a charity right here in the corner in Gainesville that that's that doesn't bring shock value amen amen let's just bring talk about Israel and Lebanon let's talk about Co let's talk about let's talk about the presidential debate and how Kamala is this and and Trump is that and all that that brings shot Valley because it brings Revenue to those to those companies it's all about money Saints if you think that this is something about something else you're you're missing the point it's all about money they got agendas to push they're told what to what to say and that's why why they say that's why that's why you see it constantly in the in the news Cycles because somebody's got to make money advertising and consumer culture we we are always um just just bombarded with with hundreds of ads telling us that that we'll be happy if we buy this and buy that you see and so uh it's the voice of consumerism right the more you spend the more happy you will be and as soon as you buy this latest version of this thing then you'll be set but once you get it and you've had it in your house for about a week you're going to want the next version is the same thing with your phone the same thing with your Apple watch it's the same thing you you think I've got it made I remember when the first Apple iPhone came out and and we we thought wow it just can't be can't be any better than this man that's obsolete now in 2007 when that came out or 2006 that that's just obsolete right now I and we thought it was the latest and greatest thing and and and it's come to the point where technology is almost so boring now because every single moment something new some new gadget's coming along and and some somebody you know I got some sometimes Brothers come up to me hey look at this and look at this I honestly don't really care anymore really because it's so it it's so overwhelming now so much gadgets and so many little buttons and so many features to thing I ain't even got time to even look at all that just give me what I need to do all I need is to be able to hit over over over and that's it amen to be able to get my slides going I don't need anything else amen but they want make you think that you need all that stuff and all it is is just for you to waste time amen so that you can look at that amen and forget about God and forget about the time I needed to go pray but yet I was sitting here trying to figure out the options about this this new phone that I have and and you wanted that new tablet so that you could study the word of God yeah but you got caught up with the with the with the options you got caught up with the with the how to update to this latest IOS to this latest OS and and you thought that it was you were doing something for God because I'm doing it for God and you're wasting your time on the actual thing rather than that thing being a blessing to you oh my I I didn't even know I was going to go there but somebody needed [Laughter] it it's how easy we get so distracted amen technology is very very distract in nowadays sure it's good and it it helps us like we're using it right now but if we're not careful it can be very distracting entertainment and streaming services is another voice that we have to battle uh with endless content on Netflix and YouTube entertainment competes for our time making it hard to find space for for reflection or space with with to have uh time with God right or even spend time with your family right the think oh well oh I'm spending time with our family we're watching this movie together yeah and that'll be fine that that that's good amen but there's other things that we can do with our families as well praise God and political and ideological polarizations is another voice that we have to battle in this hour polarized voices urge us to take sides feeling confusion Division and constant conflict I don't know of any time here in the in the time that I've been in the United States I came when I was 1987 I was 7 years old I don't know of any other time that this country has been more divided than it has been now ever since 19 ever since 2020 covid really divided things amen and and and and and to me it seems like that is exactly what they wanted because if you have divided people then it's easy to to to to conquer them and so it's happening right now and so that's why you got people all you know Trump trump Trump trump and Trump's going to fix everything I'm sorry to tell you but Trump is not going to fix everything Trump is not the Superman that you think he is that doesn't mean that I'm for Cala and I'm am man that that just means that Trump is not my Superman Jesus Christ is the only one that could fix this nation and and uh and in in reality uh this nation's already gone brother brandham said this nation rejected Christ back in 1957 and so when he when they did that this is all just the symptoms of that rejection amen so I feel bad for the people you know they really they really think that the system is for them in reality the system is against each and every one of us amen your vote doesn't count you're you think it it does Amen but it really doesn't and so so I it it's all it is is is dividing so there's the voices of Pol of politicians amen the productivity culture is another voice amen the push to be more productive tells us to optimize every moment often at the expense of resting and and and and and spending time with your family you know to I got to EMB better myself and really what that ha what that does is it makes you self-centered and it makes you look at more at yourself rather than looking at other people and their needs you see and so that that although and I'm not saying that's bad that is a good thing for you to to want to be healthier and want and want to uh have more Charisma and then and and all those things you could go to YouTube and you can look at any YouTube uh uh any about any topic that's that's good you should EMB better yourself but often at the cost amen of you becoming self-centered because now other people don't do it like you amen and you have the word you have the word on it you know you're the expert although you only watch two YouTube videos but you're the expert on it amen because you are studying you're looking at that topic amen and you have become the expert and nobody else could do it like you now right it makes you look self-centered right amen so the productivity the the the productivity culture is another voice that we have to that we have to fight in this hour amen praise God the Self Health self-help and wellness industry is another voice constant Wellness advice implies we're never doing enough for our Mental Health Fitness or personal growth that can apply also to the previous voice that we were looking at Ai and algorithms and I'm going quickly here algorithms on social media and shopping sites tailor content to our habits amen you want to know why is it that I was just now talking about this with my friend or with my mom and all of a sudden I go to Facebook and it's showing me ads about this you know why it's because your phone listens to you amen your tablets listen to you amen those things are not private those things are there to to to bring that's why they bring those ads up amen because they're algorithms cookies and all those kind of things they know what you want amen amen and so therefore that's what they're going to bring up to you and it works wonders and it works perfectly I I I do internet marketing and and I've delved in those things and and it works so if it didn't work that's the reason why uh uh it wouldn't they wouldn't stop doing it and then the pressure to document life is another voice that we have to amen people think that they always have to document everything they do on social media amen the social pressure amen the the the of of documenting my breakfast documenting when I when I brush my teeth documenting when I'm going to the office documenting everything amen that it's becoming a habit amen and and and you think that that's that that's just part of my life I've got to let people know what I'm doing but you don't right you don't the people that lived back in in in 20 years ago they they lived just fine they they lived they actually they live better peaceful lives to be honest with you then and and with with the with the I honestly think that that's the reason why this technology is just so overwhelming and all these these things and you know what and I'm thinking you know what things were better back 20 years ago in that regard because you don't have those voices those pressures that I I have a Facebook account therefore I've got to make use of it so I've got a docu I got an Instagram account therefore I've got to make use of it you don't you don't amen praise God and if it's bothering you and if it hurt if it's wasting your time just just get rid of it then amen you don't need to be on Instagram you don't need to be on Twitter and you don't need to be on Facebook or any of those things amen just get rid of it if if it's bothering you right amen and then of course competing expectations amen with so many roles to balance amen it can feel like we're constantly juggling expectations and trying to do it all amen so that's another voice that we have to uh conquer in this hour thinking that we are super moms or we are super dads and we could do it we could do it but but in reality at the end of the day you're just so exhausted and you don't even have any time for God because you try to give time to everybody else it's it's okay you give time to your wife to your children amen but at the end in the long run amen you gave everybody else time but you didn't give God his time amen amen and what does that do Saint comes upon you and say L's see it brings in that condemnation brings in that condemnation and you think that you're doing right so those are the voices in this hour saints that we have to battle amen when God Amen the original originally gave adam only one voice to listen to and that was his voice amen he didn't have to look and listen to any other voices amen but then Satan brought in his opinion his voice and now that's where we're in the uh in the uh situation that we're in now with the world praise God Amen so Eve she got distracted from the voice of God and and and so gen in Genesis chapter 3 where we just reading it says but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die so God had said this so his voice was already going forward right his voice was the preeminent thought or the preminent thing there in the garden amen and that's all that Adam and Eve had to listen to if they could just stay with that voice amen they would not have been in trouble and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die and so the serpent had a voice as well and we know it was the voice it was um it was Satan was the influencer of that voice right and so brother Bram says here in um he says many are like Eve Eve just stopped long enough to be deceived it's the reason why I have that image like that she's paying attention if she hadn't have stopped there have never been no deceiving because because she was listening to the voice of the serpent right but Eve stopped and when she stopped there's where she got her deceiving in other words brother brandom is saying that if you don't take the time right if you don't take the time Amen to document your lunch amen instead of spending time with God Amen then then you you you won't feel that condemnation then then afterwards right I'm just giving that as an example because that's what Eve did amen she stopped just long enough to listen to what the serpent had to say Amen to what the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil had to say and therefore amen she was she was she got deceived amen instead of pressing on brother brandham says amen we always talk about amen don't let the don't uh we're pressing on Amen don't let the battle press you amen but we're pressing the battle right praise God and do you do you follow follow me close now listen the reason that Eve was deceived let's say it together so I'll be sure you got it the reason Eve was deceived she never kept the full word of God that's right amen amen this is Brother bram's quote Satan quoted it to her but he never told her all the truth neither does his denomination see but she stayed long enough to get part of the word part of it you see that's what that's what fools you and that's what Satan does in this hour amen is that he gives you enough work word amen to allow you to not feel condemned as you're doing it once you do it then you feel condemned because you didn't stay with the full word amen you only had enough word to just do that specific thing and then Satan comes on top of it and that's when he brings his condemnation you see brother but it was his voice amen right Satan quoted it to her but he never told her all the truth neither does his denomination but she stayed long enough to give part of the word and didn't take all the word and that was the problem she didn't take all the word amen so as we were saying God's voice is creative it's active and it's alive Amen in Genesis 1:3 we see that God said let there be light and brother Bram said there is no inter you don't need that didn't need interpretation how did it interpret Itself by there being lighten right that is that is the interpretation of and God said let there be light amen light appeared amen and so that and that was God's voice I want you all to remember that God's voice and God's word is not two different things it's the same thing amen the voice of God is the word of God praise God Amen Psalms 339 says this for he spake and it was done amen amen he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast in other words it Stood Still amen it stood it stood it stood fast praise God amen and so quickly what is the voice of the lord we know the word the voice of the Lord there's different things you can we we'll read here in Psalms 29 these are different things that the voice of the Lord is and the voice Psalms 29:3 says the voice of the Lord is upon the waters the god of Glory Cedars yay the Lord breth The Cedars of Lebanon those are trees really really thick trees the voice of the Lord continuing in the same in the same chapter the voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire I like that I was reading that I was like the the voice of the Lord divideth the flame amen that's what he did with the three Hebrew children amen the voice of the Lord came in there amen and which was God himself amen because they stood with the full word amen then the full word stays with them hallelujah amen praise God and so it came in there and it fanned the Flames for them and they came out of there not even smelling like smok oh my if Eve would have done the same thing Amen in that hour when she was being talked to amen if she would have just stayed with the full word she would have come out unscathed amen and Adam would have come out unscathed amen but because she did not stay with the full word of God Amen like the three Hebrew children did they said we'll do anything for you you King we have respect for you but we will not bow down to that image we want to let the world know who we worship amen praise God and I hope that that's your desire tonight amen when it comes down to it amen you'll let the whole world know that I only Worship the Lord Jesus Christ and if he doesn't free me amen well I'm I'm still I'm not still going to bow down to the culture I'm not still going to bow down to the voice of Technology I'm still not going to bow down to the voice of social media or to the voice of the news Cycles amen I'm going to stay with the word amen cuz the word can fight for me amen president Trump can't amen CNN can't amen the the latest Android tablet can't fight for me amen but God's word will fight for me amen praise God because it's Eternal and it's able Amen to Flame the to to divide the Flames amen so that's what the voice of the Lord does it divides the flames of fire as well the voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness amen the Lord shaketh the Wilderness of Kadesh praise God Amen and so that was the voice of the Lord amen powerful and Majestic but then also the voice of the Lord is a gentle whisper when he was talking to Elijah and Elijah heard the the sweet the still M SM Small Voice amen am praise God but it was powerful amen sometimes I don't know if it's happened to you but it happens to me sometimes the greatest things that God has ever been revealed to me have been in the quietest moments amen when I've been in prayer or when I'm praying often times the Lord reveals to me things as I'm praying I don't know if it happens to you amen but but but that that those are wonderful things and and I take that as as God speaking to me right there and then right if something comes because Satan didn't bring that to my mind some of those things have become sermons later on Satan's not going to bring me sermons amen so it must be God right amen but also the voice of the Lord is like thunder amen and and in John you know we we read there in John when where where where Jesus uh was baptized in uh uh uh or being baptized and and and and the voice came out of the out of the uh out of the sky and people thought that they had thundered you see but it was the voice of the Lord man a sound of many Waters we'll talk about that in a little bit commanding it's talks so commanding and clear it can speak through anything amen do you know that the voice of the Lord can speak through any it can use anything to speak through amen and I put here it SP spoke through a burning bush amen it spoke through a burning bush to talk to Moses right that mean that means the pre God's voice was right there God was in that bush amen God's voice also spoke to a through a donkey one time too Amen to to a rebellious Prophet amen who was going to go curse the children of Israel amen but he God used the donkey Amen to speak to a rebellious Prophet amen so God could use whatever he wants to amen and if he was able to use a donkey then I he can use he can use this dumb this dumb donkey right here I know he can amen if he was able to speak to a d a donkey in the in in the Old Testament amen I know that he could use this dumb donkey amen it's also a voice from Heaven amen praise God so that is the voice of God now in in and I'm just trying to go quickly here and Adam and Eve they separated themselves from this voice and we read we read there in Genesis 3:8 and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden amen now just think of this and we're going to go back to the to we're going to go back to the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve were created that voice walked with them amen right that voice being God Amen that voice being the word right it was with them it was some much with them that Adam could SP could say uh uh mountain move over here tree I don't you know my wife doesn't like for you to be there so I'm going to move you over here you know my wife knows better about home decorating so uh uh you know let's move you over here and that and that and that tree had to obey yes it is why because Adam had the voice of the Lord amen praise God now we know Adam was eternal in the soul amen and if he would have kept eating from that tree of life eventually his body would have come to full eternal life amen but now sin came in the picture Adam and Eve listened to the voice of the serpent amen and so that separated them they got scared did they got now fearful from the voice of God because now the voice of God was walking through this in the same way because remember he's the same yesterday today and forever so if God did it a certain way amen when Adam when he was talking Adam amen he was he came down the exact same way to speak to Adam but Adam was nowhere to be found right how Adam was hiding behind bushes why because he was scared right and that is the same way we get amen when we have when we're under sin when we're done wrong when we're doing things underhandedly when we're not right and you know that you're not right what do we want to do we want to go hide y right we want to go hide from the view of others we want to go hide from the view of everybody else why because there's something underlying there that you don't want to be right it was doesn't want to be shown and so here's the same voice amen and they heard the voice of the Lord when that voice of the Lord was something sweet that would draw them now it's something that they want to hide from and it really wasn't them it was sin that came in the picture because now they realize they were naked y right now they realize they had done something wrong and so that voice of the Lord God Amen the grace of God Amen that even though that they were in sin even though that they had done wrong the voice of the Lord was still looking for them that's right amen that's why brother Bram said it's not you seeking God it's God seeking you amen it's God seeking you the whole time amen praise God the mercy and the grace of the Lord amen and it says here in Genesis 3:8 and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden so this voice amen had had could walk right it had two feet yeah it did it had it had it could move it could it could go from one place to the other and it was looking for them amen in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God from that voice amongst the Trees of the garden y right and that and that's what people do amen when they're not right with God that's what they go do they go hiding amen they go hiding amen from the voice of God Amen they don't want to come to church they don't want to read the word they don't want to stay in the amen because why they have separated themselves from that voice because that voice condemns their life that voice condemns everything that they're doing that voice cond amen not not that it wants to condemn but it automatically does that amen because they know within themselves I'm not right I'm not right and therefore the that's what the word does because the only thing to do at that moment is to repent amen then when you repent amen you come back to the voice and amen everything's all right then praise God now look brother Bram said in the message the voice of God in this last days how many we live with believe that we're in the last days how many believe that that voice of God is in this last day amen Adam heard his voice in the cool of the evening and had fellowship with him amen I apologize that that's all the way down there um there was no condemnation to Adam he heard the voice of God and he said father now I lay me down to sleep and he laid down and Eve on his arm arm the lion the tiger and the wild beast laid right around there was no harm no way of getting sick amen no way of wondering if he'd wake up in the morning they're going to wake up amen Adam heard his voice in the way that he ought to have heard it in other words I I like that because brother Bam's saying when you are truly in tune with the voice of God it brings peace and not condemnation amen when you are really walking with the Lord the way you need to be amen it really amen when the brother is preaching and laying out the word amen that's what causes you to say Amen to the word and there's no condemnation in you to not say Amen to the word amen maybe you may not say it verbally but you're saying it within your heart amen why because there's no barrier of condemnation there but when there's condemnation there amen then that hinders you from listening to The Voice abut amen true but one day he heard his wife's voice brother Bram continues and then he says I better leave that alone for a [Laughter] while but he listened to the wrong voice amen amen yet it was his wife now I I I I highlighted this because I thought this was very interesting he said but he listened to the wrong voice yet it was his wife the closest tie he had on earth oh my it's the it's it's it could be man the closest thing that you have in your life maybe your husband maybe your maybe your wife maybe your children that's binding you amen from Walking with God the way you need to oh but I've got to do it for them I I've got to and you have not even spent time with God your own self you're not even thinking about your own soul trying to think about your children's Soul amen amen and it was that same thing that stopped them amen from listening to the voice it was it was Eve the one that he loved and the one that that that came out of him amen bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh life of my life it was her voice that caused Adam Amen to make the decision that he made that's why I have to stop that there and Adam's paying attention to his wife right there amen I wish we paid attention like this at church sometimes amen but but but you all are doing very good tonight amen amen praise God and you see and then that's what caused his downfall amen and so brother BR continues to say why didn't he like job like in other words why didn't he say like job to his wife thou speakest like a foolish woman in other words Eve what are you talking about don't don't you know bring give the word back to her right amen but he didn't amen amen he didn't I don't know what happened there he didn't all right and so brother brand continues to say if it would the whole human race would be living in instead of dying if Adam would have done that if he would have corrected his wife in other words oh my I'll leave that [Laughter] alone it changed the course of human beings and time but he heard a voice of God he had fellowship with it but when he turned amen just like Eve turned when he turned how did he know that his wife was wrong remember it was pleasant right I don't think Eve was bringing it to Adam Amen in an unpleasant way I think it was pleasant as well right amen therefore he had to he fell for it as well and that's how Satan comes to you he comes in amen with dainties amen if I could say it that way old British word he don't come with you amen with with looking like like Kiss You know from the 1980s you know with their tongue sticking out and like all devil horns no that's not how he comes at you you like oh how do you know about kiss well anyways he doesn't come like that he comes very very very pleasant very nice very very aesthetic you know very very very something very pleasant something specific to you oh yeah CU he knows you and he's known you from ever since you were born right amen so he knows what you like he knows what what attracts you he knows he knows how to uh keep your attention long enough amen you know when you go sometimes and you know I need to go back to Facebook and I there's some information an address I need to get there because I got to get next thing you know you're there scrolling on Facebook amen through people's feeds and you weren't even planning on doing that amen and they just look so it looks so good next thing you know it's been 10 minutes and you've been scrolling Doom scrolling right that's Satan's Dain dainties Wast your time right now you know about everybody what everybody else is doing now what can that do for you how is that going to pay your bills how is that going to get you to the address that you originally needed to go to get it won't you see so it's time consuming praise God but it's Pleasant now so let's move on God's voice from from the prophets to Jesus throughout the Old Testament all you could hear was the voice of God speaking through the prophets that voice then manifested in through Jesus right that same voice that spoke through the prophets brother brandham said that it built the body of Jesus Christ amen and you can read about that in Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother brandom talks about that and and it says in Hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 and 2 God who at Su times and diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken to us unto us by his son amen whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world Amen so now that voice is moving from the Garden of Eden moving through the Old Testament through the prophets comes to the Lord Jesus Christ and we know the Lord Jesus Christ the son of man the head right amen that voice again manifesting itself manifested itself in flesh amen the brother Brown said that the the the voice of the prophets amen Jeremiah Moses and all of them amen they built the body of the Lord Jesus Christ amen or in other words what does that mean it prophesied that the Lord Jesus Christ was coming and because it was prophesied and it was thus sayth the Lord that word had to come to place had to come on the scene and that's why it say it build the body of Jesus Christ right so so so and and so he was the Lord Jesus Christ with that same voice that said let there be light now speaking in flesh Amen to a to a humans just like you and me amen yeah but it was just the head amen it was just the head speaking at that time Amen brother brother Bram said that there were some things that the Lord Jesus Christ didn't do because he needed to do them at a specific time amen praise God and so it was the Lord Jesus Christ speaking amen the full word amen praise the Lord but now that voice has to keep moving amen amen praise God and so Jesus voice is God's voice in John 10 it says to it says here to him the Porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own Sheep by name amen amen he had a word specifically for you amen and that word called you by your name it had your name all tied into it amen therefore that's why we could sing he knows my name amen praise God he knew it before the foundation of the world and that's why he prepared a word specifically for you amen because he knew you would respond to it amen because it had your name involved in it amen praise God and leadth them out amen and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice amen they know that there's something about this amen that that that that doesn't sound like every other voice amen it sounds like it sounds like Like Home to me amen I remember when I heard the V the voice of God Amen through this message the first time amen nobody sat there and explain things to me word by word they they didn't go back and read the the Greek or the Hebrew or or anything like that the brother just just just mentioned what he was talking about to me uh and it and and it just drawed me amen something said that's that's the word that's the Bible amen and it was calling my voice it calling my name amen amen and you know you you've had your own experiences with that word that way something just draws you Amen to that and it says that's that's nothing but the truth amen it can't be anything else it can't be a lie it can't be something else it's got to be the truth amen and because you accepted it amen amen then that truth has kept you to this day amen my sheep hear my voice and and I know them amen that's why he can say he knew you before the foundation of the world all right right praise God and they follow me amen John 18:37 says to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice in other words everyone that is of that predestination representation of predestination amen or of that of of that thought amen of God right is going to hear his voice amen amen that's why amen the the prophets amen they they spoke the body of Jesus and that word had to fall amen exactly where it needed to be in order to build the body of Jesus amen God was watching over that word the whole time amen just as God watch that word that verse that's that exact verse or that word that you needed Amen to come in Amen in this hour that we're living in amen praise God Amen now the voice is in the whole body now praise the Lord amen now we we we know that there was a shout uh and and what is the shout it's the messenger calling the Brad together through the message amen and we also know that there was a voice in John 11 that same voice that raised Lazarus from the dead is the same voice that will raise the sleeping bride Amen in this hour throughout all the ages amen those who have died Through the Ages brother Brandon said in the sermon the Rapture amen praise God and he says this the second is a voice of of the Resurrection the same voice amen amen that see the bride is not going to speak anything outside of the voice of God Amen she stays with what is the voice of God Amen it's the word amen it's it's him am amen that's the voice praise God that a loud voice in St John 11: 38:44 that called Lazarus from the grave you see amen getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the dead but you see if Jesus did it amen as the son of man here on Earth then his bride has to follow amen they has follow the same suit amen praise God whatever the head does the body follows amen why because it's of the same voice and there's that connection I like what brother uh the brother Steve what's his name Steven Wilson was saying that he is the head and we are the body amen we're the we're the neck that connects to the Head amen praise God and where are those vocal cords amen praise God but she only speaks by his voice amen praise God he is the head amen but she speaks only by his voice amen praise the Lord Jesus Christ so it it's it's you know sometimes we hear we hear you know uh I'm the head of the house but then we also know that you know well I'm the neck that moves the [Laughter] head but it's it's really amen God that this body does not move amen spiritually speaking now this body does not move unless the head gives it the the the Commandment right really and that's that's how it should be praise the Lord it has to come from the head first then the body moves amen amen if the body is doing something involuntarily amen that the head is not commanding it then it's not it's not there's no full connection there something is something is is missing or something is lacking amen and that's the reason why we always have to check up in our lives oh you know I like this part of the Bible but when it comes to this I'm not sure because I don't know I just don't feel like it's needful the word says it which is the voice amen The Voice amen that you speak is not anything outside of what the head is already thinking or what the head already thought you see you only stay with the word amen that's that's the only thing that the body amen the bride stays with the word which is the voice in this hour all right and then the trumpet we know that that it's going to announce the Gathering of the Bride symbolized as a feast in the sky for the wedding supper of the lamb praise the Lord Jesus amen so we're there that the shout The Voice the trumpet amen you can I believe it's in first Thessalonian or second Thessalonians where Paul talks about this now just moving quickly she uh she is him um and brother Bram says in the rising of the Sun and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth C it's part of him amen it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations of uh uh any others has spok of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride amen amen if it's something different if it's your own opinion it's not part of his voice amen that's your own voice then praise God because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of His of his power she is him amen why that's what makes her him amen because she is part of the same voice she's part of the same mold in other words praise God as men and women are one and women and woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminine Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics in the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and me that that neck and that head and made mechanics and Dynamics until the church or the people all right now quickly in Revelations chapter 10 one it says this this is John speaking and I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet right saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us right in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto e eus and unto smyna and unto pergamus and unto thar unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto leosia and I turned to see the voice that spake with me John turned to to see the voice and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the paps with a golden girdle amen praise the Lord that is feminist amen amen praise the Lord his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice has the sound of many Waters amen this is where I want to talk about the many Waters praise the Lord Jesus because here John is looking at this scene he's looking at the Lord Jesus Christ and he and and and when when he turns and looks at it and he sees the Lord Jesus Christ amen but when he hears his voice it's at the voice of many Waters in other words the voice of many and what does Waters represent it represents people amen praise God and so what is making up the body of Christ amen it's you and I in this house that's the reason why John when he turned and looked amen he saw the he saw the Lord Jesus Christ but what was speaking amen through his voice amen were many people amen it was you and I in this hour amen so that voice amen now Adam did not have that voice amen EX exactly the way he wanted it because he separated himself from that voice Here Comes Here Comes the the pro the pro the the the the prophets amen they build up the body of Christ that voice is in the Lord Jesus Christ he is the head but we know as we talked about the other day God is not he he doesn't have a freak body right amen it's not just a head floating amen right and it's not just a headless body walking right it's a head and a body together amen praise the Lord and so now that voice amen has traveled amen from the son of man now that son of man is in the bride today praise the Lord she is him amen praise God that exact same voice amen the sound of many Waters praise the Lord Jesus brother brandom called it the sound of of of the ministry amen the sound of the preachers in that in in in this hour amen praise the Lord Jesus but but you are the preachers today amen praise God it's not just not just the five-fold ministry you if this voice is in you you can say to this mountain amen move here and it'll move amen it's got to obey you amen you can call things as they are as they're and they're as they're not or as they're not as they are amen because that same voice dwells in you in this hour amen you don't have to depend on just the preacher brother way to pray for you or or or or the the the Evangelist to come in here or wait for brother Andrew globber to come through here amen you've got the power in this hour amen why because you have the same word that they do amen that voice is in you in this hour amen oh but I'm not I'm not where I should be amen well get right with God Amen then you can be where you where you can and speak in conditions amen there's nothing holding you back amen there's nothing holding you you holding yourself amen God already said amen I want this voice to travel from amen from just the Garden of Eden Amen to the head which is the Lord Jesus Christ and now to the body amen praise God where the vocal cords are amen praise the Lord right brother spiritual vocal cords hallelujah amen oh my praise God thank God for that amen and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a Shar what went out of his mouth the voice because what is the voice the word what is the word the two-edged sword hallelujah amen amen his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and and his countenance was as the son shineth in his strength hallelujah amen thank God Amen that he that God wasn't wasn't selfish with his word amen amen God wants you to enjoy his word just as much as he enjoyed it speaking it amen amen he wants you to speak it as well amen he wants you to create with his word you have just as much power and disire to create amen amen now then that's where I get the title of this of this sermon but in the days of the voice amen Revelations 107 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel we know brother brandham had a he he spoke out sure but it wasn't brother branham's voice per se right because brother brandham didn't have a word of his own right remember what is the voice it's the word amen right it's an active Living Word Amen brother brandham is long gone y right right we know that we'll see him again amen praise the Lord but that voice still has power in this hour in you and me amen when you are listening to the prophet when you're listening to those messages amen it's still influencing you but it's not necessarily brother branham's voice it's the word of God that was spoken through his voice amen that's what's influencing you in this hour but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel that is that is the prophet amen the the the the church age messenger of L brother brandham when he shall begin to sound amen the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets right now verse eight look what verse eight says and the voice which I heard from Heaven amen do you think that that's the same voice that that the messenger of of of of Revelations 10:7 heard as well it's got to be the from the same Source amen so what does John represent John represents the bride he's a type of the Bride she's hearing the exact same voice that the voice of the seventh Church age Angel the the the the person in Revelations 10:7 heard as well amen that's why she is him amen not she is brother brandham she is God Amen and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book now it's interesting that in Revelations 10:7 it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound there's something that brother Brenham did he began to sound but then there's something that we must do in Revelations 10:8 with this voice as well amen and said go and take the little book amen which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth oh it's not enough Saints for just the preacher to study the word amen it's not enough for just the Evangelist to study the word or the pastor amen you've got to take the open little book let me tell you what the book is open it's not closed so it's not too difficult to study am amen praise God it's open book in this hour amen God has spoken it amen through the church seventh Church age messenger and it's up to us to take it in it's up to you amen if you're going to take it in or not but the book is open am amen the book is open that's for sure amen and so in Revelations 3:20 it says yep behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door this is Jesus speaking If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him amen when you take that voice you're taken in the word y that means Christ will come into you amen and will Su with you what's up amen have dinner with you that's right amen take you for a nice dinner and not just one nice dinner amen you can have just one nice dinner at Golden Corral or or or or or you know depending on what your you know your finances you know it might be Denny's or might be Taco Bell you know and it could be a it can be a nice dinner for you amen but then there's also you know the the nice restaurants in Atlanta you know that you could go to but but you know what that that is just one time you know Jesus Christ is always supping with us he's always buying me nice fancy dinners amen praise God and I'm always buying him fine fancy dinners when I hear his word receive his word amen we're supping together we're we're communicating with here what is fellowship amen two two fellows in one ship right amen and then it's two fellows in this word amen there's something to talk about but that's where the reason why amen when there's nothing to talk about with somebody is probably they're not in the word the way they should but either both of them are not in the word or one of them is not in the word and they're not compatible right amen that's why sometimes are not a lot to talk about with some people amen that might be just the way they are but sometimes it's because they really don't they don't they're not in the word the way amen and you don't really fellowship with what they with with what they're they want to talk about you see they want to talk about hockey or they want to talk about football and you don't really Fellowship around that right amen you might know a couple of scores here and there or whatever but that's not your Forte right your Forte is the word amen when somebody wants to talk to you about the word amen because you are part of the word you're a part of the voice amen that Voice rings to you right that sounds that sounds good to me amen praise God and I will come into him and I will s with him in other words he will fellowship and he with me amen so he's buying you dinner and you're buying him dinner right amen you both buying each other dinner amen and and it it's Eternal food it it's it's food that doesn't spoil oh my amen the steak at uh you know the steak wherever you know at that at that house over there brother Danny that that you like up there in Helen Georgia that's going to fade away amen but this steak never Fades away amen oh my this is eternal food amen so I say this Saints amen and with this we'll finish up and I have a few slides to show about some missions trips really quick Hebrews 378 says wherefore as the Holy Ghost said today if you will hear his voice not tomorrow right last time I said young people don't wait till tomorrow to go serve the Lord amen don't don't do not wait amen you you do not know what's going to happen it's not fearmongering amen it's just that the Bible says today what does it say it doesn't say tomorrow doesn't say that you have a lot of time amen it treats you like do it now today is today tomorrow is tomorrow yesterday was yesterday today if you hear his voice what is his voice his word right amen right if today if you hear his voice Harden not your hearts amen as in the provocation what is the provocation he talking about the the the Israelites in the in the in the in the wilderness when they when they tempted God many times and God Amen the patience that he had but one day his patience ran out right amen and swallowed them up all the Earth swallowed them up when when Moses said stand over here if you're going to serve the Lord or or or be over here and if you're going to serve Dayan and and and what they believe amen and God swallowed them up amen praise God right God's going to swallow up this this world this this this this world order amen going to swallow it up amen you better know that you're standing on the right side amen today today if you hear his voice don't Harden your hearts as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness amen soften it up because God is knocking amen and what's and and and he all he is is knocking and he says that but if you hear my voice I will come in unto you and we'll s with you amen that's as easy as that if you know what you need to do do it y don't wait if you know that you need to get baptized do it amen don't wait amen if that's what's next that's what's holding you back if you know that that that the next thing you need to do amen is just get down on your knees get get get get along with God somewhere amen man go do it amen amen what what's holding you back amen amen praise God you know I plead with you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen to repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins amen and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen will it things be easy afterwards no no it's a daily growth amen amen but you have that voice now you have that condemnation is is gone where now you can speak freely amen and you can say Satan I rebuke you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen the word says this and I can go forward with it and you have nothing holding you back no condemnation praise God hallelujah amen how many love the Lord amen amen praise God well real quick I just wanted to I've been needing to do this for about a week and a half or a month and a half or so but uh this is uh the our Portugal trip in in September uh back in September now this is brother martio right here um uh in the middle and he is the he was the hosting Pastor who invited me to minister at the meetings that they were having so the meetings that they were having were uh the first meetings that that were hold held in message convention that was hold held in in Portugal um brother Brandon was there back in 1954 in Portugal and when you type in in in in in the message and you type in what brother Bram said about Portugal you're only find about uh nine nine quotes and whenever he would refer to uh Portugal he he would refer to it as Portuguese so he would he wouldn't say Portugal he would just refer as Portuguese but the Portuguese are the actual people you see so brother brother Marcio brother Marcio the Gama he's from he's originally from Brazil that's his wife sister teodora and that's one of his sons right there on the right brother heft and uh they picked us up from their airport that day and brother brother uh Marcel just him and his children they had they had this Vision that hey look why don't we why don't we hold meetings here in Portugal to celebrate 70 years since the prophet was there right and so that was what that's what they did and they invited different ministers from different parts and I just happened to be one of them so I I appre I appreciate brother Marcio doing that for us now brother Marcel well this this is the in front of his church and these are just pictures of just kind of you get an idea of kind of the streets of how they look there in in in uh in Portugal this is in in uh what's the name of in montio where where where the church is located and also where brother Marcio lives um and so it's very European likee because Portugal is is in Europe so uh so it's a country right next to Spain and so so the the first night that when we got there um it was on a Wednesday I believe and I I thought that I just had to to preach later on that week when the meetings actually started so I I got there we we brother martiel picked us up took us to the to the place where we were staying at and know we rested a little bit because they're about 6 hours difference in time so right now it's 6 hours ahead right now in time and so when I we got ready to go to church that night right and we had flown almost all day and um we got ready and and good thing I wore my suit and tie and everything because when we got to church brother Mario said why don't you sit over there and he was pointing to his desk why don't you go go sit over there and I said okay and so I quickly took out my tablet and started looking through some notes cuz I I didn't know that he wanted me to preach and so uh I asked brother Mario while I was sitting there I said brother Mario you want me me to minister tonight oh yeah yeah never told me to so that's that right there you know you have to be instant in season and out of season as the word say and honestly Saints I I really did not have really something prepared however I just said Lord you know take these thoughts and let me just move on and let me tell you what Saints we had church that night amen it was it was such a blessing to me and people were up in the alt and and just just thanking God and we just really and brother Marcia was was was uh interpreting for me and uh I just appreciate the Lord I give him all the glory give him all the praise amen because he knew what the people needed in that hour he knew what the people needed there in that congregation so uh the next day or later on this week this is a um I forgot the brother's name there from Brother Joseph is the the black brother there on the left he is a he's a pastor from um from uh Manchester uh England and he uh he was also brother Marcio had invited him to speak at the convention there later that week and um and so I got to meet Brother Joseph wonderful brother he knows brother Benny Perry and he's he's been to South Carolina brother Benny peries so he knows he knows them and um so got to meet them now this is at the convention and um this is I I I I had to interpret and also preach that the whole time and really wasn't going wasn't planning to to to to to interpret but uh I I had to interpret and uh and so we ministered there at the convention now the brother there in the middle uh this brother right here this is brother Lucas Cardona and he's from Honduras he's from Honduras and uh he was there as well because his son he has a little work uh in Spain uh a church that they started in Spain and so he was visiting at that time and so brother Marcio invited him to come and speak at the Convention as well so he was there and brother Aaron you know brother Lucas brother Aaron has spoke at brother Lucas's Church before there in Honduras when we went so so we were there had a good time let me tell you what there was people from from all parts of the of the world there uh I think there was probably let's say I don't know maybe 15 countries represented there and uh and so we had really good time amen it it turned out really really nice for being the first convention and it really motivated them to to do another one and I believe the next one it'll be even better amen so of course it it isn't Honduras and it isn't Nicaragua you can see it's a they rented out a nice little place for us to to speak at so it was a it was a change we weren't riding behind trucks with dust and gasoline all you know all over you know so it was nice to have a a different chain so um but we really had a good time with him this is uh two of brother marcial's daughters right here on the left I forget their names I'm so terrible with names DAV David is the is the oldest one on the left and Gabriela is she's the youngest one and uh I don't know who these other two girls on the right are smiling yeah who's the smiling girl on the on the right she's beautiful amen so so they had a good time um and so here's some of the group that was there from England uh Germany was there Spain uh Brazil uh uh uh Switzerland uh different African countries were represented there um and so just just different parts of what' you say Italy Italy were there as well and uh there were really Filipinos that were that lived in Italy that were there so all right and there's here's some of us enjoying some fellowship after the meetings okay so we really had a good time people came to the Lord um a sister who was backslid they were praying about she came in they weren't even expecting her to be at the meetings she came her dad was praying for her and she came uh and they knew that what what was what was her spiritual condition and the the brother brother uh Brother Joseph spoke the last day the brother from England amen and it just it just touched that girl's heart that girl came and and she she she committed herself to the Lord and uh gave word back Amen to her dad who was praying for her I believe was in in Argentina Argentina and and he was just praising God Amen so that's just God all right so we appreciate your prayers on that thank you very much and uh God had his way amen and Lord willing uh he I'm scheduled to be back again with

no church near near them uh the closest is brother Matthew Bray and I think it's like two two and a half hours away so I just brother Wade said why don't you just tell them just to come over here we'll we'll baptize them we'll marry them uh all at the same time so I did and she accepted and she was very very very happy and so there was nobody here there was only just the person and their two kids the two of their kids that came the person that drove them was here and uh there were the witnesses we were Witnesses and I was interpreter and so we were able to marry them and she came in with her gown and everything and got baptized in the same gown as well so she was very very happy we still keep in touch with with her yeah and she's serving the lord she's uh she's asked asked me also to reach out to her sister who lives in Jacksonville Florida who who she wants also to come to the Lord as well so we've been able to lead brother uh uh uh we let gave her the address and the contact information of brother Ismael Maldonado down there in in in in Jacksonville Florida and she said that she was going to go to their church so you know it just it just makes me think you know we think about missions uh uh going home but see all these people are coming here now and so I get text messages all the time and WhatsApp people asking that where's the church that I can go to uh is there somewhere and and so I'm having to go around you know asking hey is there a church near this city is there a so we're having to actually do missions here within home you see and you might think oh

negative and you know they're not following the law God has he allows things for a reason do you know that I that's how I came to the Lord maybe I couldn't come to the Lord in Colombia but I came to
