[3:01] us and serving god
[3:04] all of his life's a great great
[3:05] opportunity to be
[3:07] able to been part of the services and so
[3:10] if you'd like turn in your scriptures i
[3:11] think that's at all announcements
[3:13] which only missed something but uh if
[3:16] you want to turn in your scriptures turn
[3:17] to romans
[3:18] 4. now we've been on romans 7 quite a
[3:21] while
[3:22] we dropped back this past uh weekend
[3:25] on the service there and started in
[3:28] romans 4
[3:30] and then we'll go to psalms 32
[3:33] but what we're going to do now is
[3:37] that message i didn't realize when i
[3:40] preached it i was just trying to bring
[3:41] in some
[3:42] some messages and thoughts uh maybe not
[3:45] a series
[3:47] but uh i believe it'll develop into a
[3:50] series
[3:51] so we'll just go as we're led to go you
[3:54] know try to speak on it but
[3:56] if you you know would like read um
[4:02] well we've been through the invisible
[4:03] union and all but
[4:05] i would ask you and you'll see in a
[4:07] minute why but i would ask you to really
[4:09] read matthew
[4:11] 5 on the beatitudes and we'll notice the
[4:14] difference of it
[4:15] in a moment but uh romans 4
[4:19] and psalms 32 okay
[4:22] heavenly father we thank you for all
[4:24] that you've given unto us
[4:26] thank you for the day and the hour that
[4:27] we have thank you for your love and to
[4:29] us lord thank you for grace and
[4:32] all things thank you for strength and
[4:34] love and joy that we have
[4:36] and father that we can walk in you and
[4:38] see the
[4:39] the things unfold before us that are
[4:42] promised unto us
[4:44] and we believe you lord just have your
[4:46] way now forgive our sins
[4:48] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[4:50] keep us in you
[4:51] we love you and we thank you and just
[4:53] have your way now touch the sick because
[4:55] you promised it
[4:56] you said you sent your word and healed
[4:58] us and delivered us from destruction
[5:01] so we believe you and we thank you we
[5:03] really truly believe the promises and we
[5:05] hold on to those promises
[5:07] because you said they're yea and amen
[5:09] and what a wonderful thing to be able to
[5:11] receive
[5:12] from you we love you and we thank you in
[5:14] jesus name
[5:16] amen romans 4
[5:23] what shall we say then that abraham our
[5:25] father as pertaining to the flesh hath
[5:27] found
[5:28] for if abraham were justified by works
[5:30] he had whereof to glory
[5:32] but not before god for what saith the
[5:35] scripture abraham believed god and it
[5:37] was counted unto him for righteousness
[5:40] now to him that worketh is the reward
[5:42] not reckoned of grace but of debt
[5:44] but to him that worketh not but
[5:46] believeth on him
[5:48] that justify the ungodly his faith is
[5:50] counted unto
[5:51] counted for righteousness remember james
[5:53] and paul is not contrary
[5:56] paul looks like he's saying it's all by
[5:59] faith
[6:00] no works james looks like he says it's
[6:03] all works no faith
[6:05] but that would be a contradiction in
[6:07] your scripture so james is explaining
[6:09] what the world is looking at or mankind
[6:12] and seeing it see and paul is explaining
[6:15] what god is looking at
[6:17] so then it's a wonderful story you know
[6:20] to see it
[6:21] but to him that worketh not but
[6:23] believeth on him that justify the
[6:24] ungodly his faith is counted
[6:26] for righteousness even as david also
[6:29] describes the blessedness of the man and
[6:30] to whom god imputeth
[6:32] righteousness without works saying
[6:34] blessed are they whose iniquities are
[6:36] forgiven
[6:38] and whose sins are covered blessed is
[6:40] the man to whom the lord
[6:43] will not impute sin all right let's go
[6:46] back now
[6:47] to where that is in psalms it is
[6:50] referring to so it's
[6:52] psalm 132
[6:56] excuse me 32 saying blessed is he
[7:00] whose transgression is forgiven whose
[7:03] sin is covered
[7:05] blessed is the man unto whom the lord
[7:07] imputeth not iniquity
[7:09] and whose spirit there is no guile
[7:12] when i kept silence my bones whacked o
[7:16] through my roaring all the day long
[7:20] for day and night thy hand was heavy
[7:23] upon me
[7:24] the moisture is turned into the drought
[7:27] of summer sila
[7:28] i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine
[7:32] iniquities have i not hid i said i will
[7:35] confess my transgressions unto the lord
[7:38] and thou forgave us the iniquity of my
[7:42] sins see light you may be seated the
[7:44] lord that is blessing to the reading
[7:46] of the word now i want you to pay close
[7:50] attention
[7:53] to the reading of the scriptures i
[7:55] believe that we need to
[7:57] and compare things and and you know
[8:01] and remember david is
[8:04] here in the old testament under the
[8:07] understanding
[8:08] of god in his ways
[8:11] and he's speaking of blessed the man
[8:14] whose transgression
[8:15] is forgiven whose sin is covered
[8:19] but then when you get over to paul
[8:23] he's over speaking at it from a
[8:26] situation
[8:27] of looking in god's mind and seeing it
[8:32] and he's seeing then that it is not just
[8:35] covered
[8:37] but it becomes annihilated all right so
[8:40] now you've got to cover both of them
[8:42] we'll try to get back to that scripture
[8:44] but
[8:44] you will see uh why i'm saying that as
[8:47] we go along
[8:49] because we we've tried to cover this
[8:52] past
[8:53] sunday about
[8:56] this scripture you know blessed is a man
[8:58] to whom god will not impute sin
[9:01] and
[9:04] i want to make sure you understand this
[9:06] because as i said it's a background
[9:10] now and what i do with a background is i
[9:13] lay down
[9:14] a situation or an existence
[9:17] from something to where that when it
[9:19] comes down to
[9:21] a later time then you can just look back
[9:24] and say you remember that
[9:27] or you uh i'd use it a lot of times
[9:31] to lay it down in a basis that when
[9:35] something is
[9:36] said your mind shouldn't be wondering
[9:41] running about and thinking well i think
[9:44] this is this i think this is that
[9:46] we've already been through the situation
[9:50] because that's what i do with a
[9:52] background is i lay it down to where
[9:55] that uh to me now there is no question
[9:59] but now that will not take away from
[10:01] man's mind or your thoughts
[10:04] but i'm trying to show you what i do
[10:07] in other words if i lay down a situation
[10:09] to you that there's just one true and
[10:11] living god
[10:13] there's never been but one god there's
[10:14] only one god there's no way there could
[10:16] be any other god
[10:19] well then i read a scripture about you
[10:21] know in another message
[10:22] and i'm talking about it and i come up
[10:24] and i read a scripture it said
[10:26] the god and father of our lord jesus
[10:28] christ bless you all
[10:30] god and father lord jesus christ how
[10:32] many we got
[10:34] well see if i didn't approach it the way
[10:37] i do
[10:38] you would question that point
[10:41] you know but with the point in mind i
[10:44] can refer back to you remember the
[10:45] message
[10:47] don't run your mind loose
[10:50] you know don't just take in your
[10:52] thoughts and try to interpret something
[10:55] we've already covered that there's just
[10:56] one true and living god
[10:58] you know but see i know that's what
[11:01] human i know that's the human capacity
[11:03] of mine
[11:03] because mine does the same thing but i'm
[11:07] just trying to get you to
[11:08] to pull away from that into thinking and
[11:11] then read the scriptures that
[11:13] can't be contradictory
[11:17] as i'm saying to start with about paul
[11:19] looks like he's laying it down
[11:21] that man is truly saved just by faith
[11:23] alone you know
[11:25] and then james comes along and says no
[11:27] now
[11:29] you show me your faith by your works
[11:32] well you know both of them is exactly
[11:34] right
[11:36] the point is we just didn't have them
[11:38] together
[11:41] paul is describing the way god looks at
[11:43] a thing
[11:44] james is describing the way mankind
[11:46] looks at a thing
[11:48] and and it's not a contradictory but yet
[11:51] we've argued that's been argued amongst
[11:53] organized religion
[11:54] you know probably ever since it was
[11:56] written i guess
[11:58] but now
[12:03] watch these today and keep your
[12:05] foundation correctly
[12:09] you remember last week when we were
[12:11] covering that david
[12:13] truly saw the grace of god
[12:17] because look at the things he'd done you
[12:20] know
[12:21] and was even supposed to been killed for
[12:23] taking you rise
[12:24] wife and things like that and if it
[12:27] hadn't been for the prophet
[12:29] that was bringing forth the mind of god
[12:32] into being
[12:34] they would have killed david but yet
[12:38] the prophet said i've prayed for you
[12:42] and god won't take your life but said
[12:44] he's going to take the child
[12:48] like the brother was bringing out last
[12:50] night about the scripture you know uh
[12:52] you know they're in and trying to show
[12:56] that
[13:00] you're gonna read what you sow i had it
[13:03] written in my bible i got it written on
[13:05] the side of that scripture
[13:06] brother brandon said that's not talking
[13:07] about salvation
[13:10] when you read reap what you sow is not
[13:12] talking about salvation it's talking
[13:13] about natural life
[13:15] it's talking about the existence of what
[13:16] we are
[13:18] see because we do then reap what we sow
[13:23] it's not something to say whether you're
[13:25] going to heaven or not
[13:26] amen but we're going to reap what we sow
[13:28] because if we don't get rid of what we
[13:31] do we're going to have to answer
[13:33] somewhere
[13:35] and see you say but yeah but you brother
[13:37] dale you just don't preach
[13:38] grace and things like other people i i
[13:41] can hear them preaching
[13:43] and i just feel so wonderful blessed is
[13:44] the man to whom god will not impute sin
[13:47] yeah and then you just go out and live
[13:48] like the devil
[13:52] you're showing you don't understand the
[13:53] scripture
[13:56] see that's what the psalmist is doing
[14:02] david is saying blessed is he whose
[14:06] transgression
[14:07] is forgiven whose sin is covered
[14:12] all right blessed is the man unto whom
[14:15] god
[14:16] imputeth not iniquity in whom spirit
[14:19] there is no god
[14:22] now you say well boy he's saying that
[14:26] man i'm so special a person
[14:29] you know i'm i'm a great person god
[14:31] won't count this to me because i'm just
[14:33] so great
[14:36] what did we cover last week god was
[14:39] looking at an honest and a contrite
[14:40] heart
[14:42] david at least had that much he had a
[14:44] repentant attitude
[14:45] and an honest heart that's what god was
[14:48] looking at when we get to the end of the
[14:50] message this evening
[14:51] i mean this morning uh the lord willing
[14:54] you'll see it
[14:56] but see if you think well well david is
[14:58] just saying that there's a person
[15:00] that you know just nothing can never be
[15:03] counted against them
[15:06] you know which is so great
[15:09] well why did he go in verse five
[15:15] i'm gonna pull that back up brother
[15:17] anderson for us
[15:18] why did he say this in verse five
[15:23] if you're thinking that he's just saying
[15:24] it's okey-dokey all i've done
[15:26] is okey-dokey everything's fine
[15:30] i'm just not god just don't count
[15:32] nothing to me i'm so great
[15:34] why did he say verse 5. he gets down to
[15:38] verse 5 and he says i acknowledge my sin
[15:41] unto thee now if he didn't have any
[15:43] why's he acknowledging it
[15:46] you mean he's admitting he's a sinner
[15:47] when god tells him he's not a sinner
[15:49] no he's honest he was a sinner
[15:54] i acknowledge my sin unto thee in my
[15:57] iniquity have i not hid
[16:01] where do we get down in the scripture
[16:02] right the lies may take on this evening
[16:05] but
[16:05] where the bible said if you say you
[16:07] don't have no sin
[16:09] oh you're a liar we get that up front
[16:14] you're a liar but i just don't like your
[16:18] way appreciate it because
[16:19] i don't have you know go ahead
[16:24] he said i will confess my transgressions
[16:28] unto the lord and thou forgive us
[16:32] the iniquity of my sin
[16:36] now if he's so much covered
[16:40] why would david be talking about
[16:42] acknowledging his sin
[16:47] see that's why people do that and they
[16:49] say well it don't matter what i do i'm
[16:51] saved
[16:56] you got a point
[17:01] but if we go out and live like the devil
[17:02] that proves we're not saved
[17:04] so that's on the other side of it right
[17:08] see i like to take everything and look
[17:10] at it
[17:11] in one perspective and knowing that the
[17:14] bible can't be contradictory
[17:18] that it shows the truth but yet
[17:21] sometimes we have to get it together
[17:25] for it to be revealed if not we can just
[17:29] do anything we want to and whatever
[17:31] like i said the other day we said where
[17:33] the bible said if your heart condemn you
[17:34] not
[17:35] i ain't gonna let my heart condemn me
[17:41] what did the prophet say about it
[17:44] did you got no more conscience and the
[17:47] snake's got hips
[17:50] you seared yourself away from the truth
[17:55] and yet you'll sat there i'm led of god
[17:58] and then you'll say well look what god
[18:00] does in my life
[18:02] i'm blessed you don't mean a thing when
[18:05] you're
[18:07] if you're blessed and you don't follow
[18:08] the word don't mean a thing
[18:11] that means you're a very deceived person
[18:14] if the word tells me not to do something
[18:16] then i said well the lord told me it's
[18:17] okay for me to go do it wasn't that what
[18:19] tammy face at that time
[18:22] timmy faye baker remember her might not
[18:25] recall the names but that
[18:26] she said it she said
[18:30] i asked the lord if it was wrong for me
[18:32] to paint my face sometime
[18:34] and said he didn't answer me
[18:38] so it was okay
[18:42] how carnal can we be where we propped up
[18:45] things
[18:47] all right but now think about it
[18:53] what's the difference in the reading
[18:57] we're going to read some scriptures but
[18:59] we're not going back into the beatitudes
[19:00] i hope you'll go back there
[19:02] and read it but in the beatitudes
[19:04] matthew 5
[19:06] it will say blessed are the pure in
[19:08] heart blessed are this blessed
[19:11] you know blessing all right now some
[19:14] people say blessed
[19:16] and some of us just carnal enough to say
[19:17] blessed but
[19:19] that's all right which one it is you
[19:21] read the scripture
[19:24] but now i want you to notice
[19:30] that the scripture says
[19:35] blessed is the man
[19:38] there that we read in the psalmist
[19:44] now blessed are the pure in heart for
[19:46] they shall see god
[19:48] that can be a future event
[19:53] that can be pointing forward backward or
[19:55] whatever you know
[19:56] right that's why i want you to read the
[19:58] beat attitudes
[20:00] i like what brother moat used to say
[20:01] about that he said that's that's be your
[20:03] attitude
[20:04] so that was a good point but
[20:08] i want you to notice the scripture says
[20:10] blessed is the man
[20:16] present tense when we come up to a new
[20:19] testament thought
[20:22] and dealing with it
[20:25] we're not supposed to be dealing with it
[20:27] just as a
[20:29] you know a thought but as a present
[20:32] tense
[20:34] he that saith that jesus christ is come
[20:36] in the flesh
[20:37] is of god he is come into flesh now
[20:43] not just back there two thousand years
[20:44] ago but now because
[20:47] is is bringing something down to now
[20:51] where we're at all right let's just read
[20:53] a few scriptures
[20:54] on this and then we'll get to our
[20:57] thoughts go ahead and pull up
[21:00] let's read some scriptures and just just
[21:02] see
[21:04] blessed is the man psalms 1 1
[21:08] that walketh not in the counsel of the
[21:10] ungodly or stand it in the way of
[21:12] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[21:13] scornful
[21:15] i want you to notice as we read and then
[21:17] we'll get down to the bottom one and
[21:19] bring it together
[21:20] but i want you to notice that it's like
[21:23] david as i said
[21:25] david is saying seemingly blessed is the
[21:27] man to whom looks like god won't even
[21:29] impute sin or anything
[21:31] and then turns right around and says i
[21:33] acknowledge
[21:34] my sin
[21:38] now as i said if if it's so eradicated
[21:41] and we want to try to make it
[21:44] from that point why is he acknowledging
[21:47] his sin
[21:50] see david is what paul is speaking of
[21:54] david is looking at it as from a
[21:56] repentant heart
[22:02] all right and if i repent
[22:05] god will forgive me right
[22:08] in that scripture no i won't say what is
[22:10] it blessed is a man that walketh not in
[22:12] the council of the ungodly
[22:14] nor stand it's in the way of the sinners
[22:16] are sitteth in the sea that's going for
[22:20] psalm 65 and 4
[22:23] blessed is the man whom and
[22:26] blessed is the man of whom thou choose
[22:28] us
[22:30] something new with choosing and cause us
[22:33] to approach unto thee
[22:34] that he may dwell in thy courts we shall
[22:38] be satisfied with the goodness
[22:40] of the house even of thy holy temple
[22:43] let's keep rolling up
[22:45] 80 psalms 84 and verse 5
[22:48] blessed is the man whose strength is in
[22:51] thee
[22:52] and whose heart are the ways of them
[22:56] a connection to an honest and a contrite
[23:00] heart
[23:03] that's what i want you to do with the
[23:04] scriptures get the connection
[23:07] of how that he's pouring out his heart
[23:09] to god
[23:12] and god is hearing that and saying he's
[23:16] blessed
[23:19] because when he's saying blessed to
[23:21] start see
[23:22] he's saying what god says
[23:25] but then when he gets down to the other
[23:27] party
[23:29] he's saying what he is blessed god is
[23:32] saying blessed is the man
[23:34] whose strength is in thee in whose heart
[23:37] are the ways of them
[23:39] psalms 84 and 12 o lord of hosts blessed
[23:43] is the man that trusts us in thee
[23:45] psalms 94 and 12 blessed is the man
[23:49] whom thou chasteneth o lord
[23:52] and teaches him out of thy law
[23:56] that's why i love the scriptures over in
[23:58] the corinthians for the communion
[24:04] god will chasten us
[24:07] right all right
[24:12] go ahead psalms 112 and verse 1
[24:16] praise you the lord blessed is the man
[24:19] that feareth
[24:20] the lord that delighteth greatly in his
[24:23] commandments
[24:25] all right proverbs 8 and 34 blessed is
[24:27] the man that heareth me
[24:29] watching daily at my gates waiting at
[24:32] the post of my doors
[24:34] isaiah 65 1 and 2
[24:37] thus saith the lord keep ye judgment and
[24:40] do justice
[24:42] for my salvation is near to come and my
[24:45] righteousness to be revealed
[24:46] what now blessed is the man that doeth
[24:49] this
[24:51] what that keeps his judgments that
[24:54] realize justice realizes
[24:55] salvation is near this is the man that
[24:58] doeth this and the son of man that left
[25:00] hold on it
[25:01] that keepeth the sabbath from polluting
[25:03] it and keeps his hands from doing evil
[25:06] jeremiah 17 7 blessed is the man that
[25:10] trusteth in the lord
[25:12] and whose hope the lord is
[25:15] james 1 verse 12
[25:18] blessed is the man that endure
[25:20] temptation
[25:21] for when he has tried he shall receive
[25:23] the crown of life
[25:25] which the lord hath promised to them
[25:26] that love him
[25:28] right now we're back to the psalms
[25:32] that we read 132
[25:36] i mean 32 1-5
[25:41] a psalm of david michelle
[25:44] everybody pronounce that blessed is he
[25:48] whose transgression
[25:49] is forgiven whose sin is covered
[25:55] now remember in the old testament
[25:59] sin was only covered
[26:03] there was nothing to take it away
[26:08] and brother harris used to use the word
[26:09] and preach the message on it one time
[26:11] called it capo it means it's covered
[26:16] all right now
[26:20] blessed is the man unto whom the lord
[26:22] imputed not iniquity
[26:23] why it's covered
[26:27] and whose spirit there is no guile why
[26:30] because it's covered
[26:32] right and when i keep silent my bones
[26:35] wax
[26:36] you know old am i roaring all day long
[26:41] for the day and night thy hand
[26:45] was heavy upon me my moisture is turned
[26:48] into the drought of the summer
[26:51] see in other words if if when i
[26:54] keep silence
[26:58] the bible says it's like a you know it
[27:00] shut up in your bones
[27:03] all right then when he's saying in day
[27:06] and night
[27:08] my hand was heavy upon me why was god's
[27:10] hand heavy upon him
[27:12] if everything was so perfect and clear
[27:18] see why would we think that why would we
[27:21] think that
[27:21] well it's okay for me to go do wrong
[27:23] because i'm saved anyway
[27:27] i didn't believe that in the baptist
[27:29] church and i stayed there a long time
[27:33] but i didn't believe it
[27:39] look then he says i acknowledge my sin
[27:42] unto thee
[27:44] and my iniquity have i not hid.
[27:49] i will confess my transgressions unto
[27:51] the lord
[27:53] and thou forgave us the iniquity of my
[27:55] sin
[27:57] see then you can see real quickly that
[27:59] this is not talking about just
[28:01] well it's okay to go do anything even
[28:04] the psalmist david
[28:06] using the biggest portion of the
[28:07] scriptures from the old testament form
[28:11] and to show that it's just covered
[28:15] see those old testament saints never had
[28:17] the new birth
[28:19] all right now as you'll see when i'm
[28:22] going along then
[28:23] david is really speaking of
[28:27] someone in the new testament
[28:31] because he's acknowledging his sins
[28:34] and admitting that they're covered
[28:39] right so david is not just saying well
[28:43] it's okay for me to go do like i want to
[28:44] because i'm saved anyway
[28:50] david's not saying that
[28:53] neither is paul saying anything about it
[28:55] like that
[28:59] he's saying like exactly what it is
[29:06] the truth
[29:09] if we think we don't have to worry about
[29:11] the way we live
[29:14] even if it now listen listen everybody
[29:17] listening
[29:18] even if that would be true that it
[29:20] didn't make no difference whatsoever
[29:24] why would you want to live that before
[29:26] others
[29:32] to let them think it's okay for them to
[29:35] do it
[29:38] why would it even be in considered in
[29:40] our mind
[29:42] of a thought
[29:46] that it doesn't make no difference what
[29:48] we do
[29:50] we're saved anyway
[29:58] what are we doing with it
[30:01] we're taking somebody's idea
[30:05] like i said life's not coming home we're
[30:08] talking about
[30:09] you know and you take it to the point
[30:13] that
[30:14] you don't have any sin you don't have
[30:16] any
[30:20] condemnation
[30:23] you better be checking to see whether
[30:25] you're saved or not
[30:28] why would not we want to be concerned oh
[30:36] we're in the new testament where it just
[30:37] don't make no difference though
[30:39] because god even said to david blessed
[30:41] of the man to whom god will not impute
[30:42] sin
[30:46] that's what i'm saying when paul picked
[30:48] it up he's looking through the mind of
[30:50] god
[30:53] david never said it like that
[31:00] david said my sins are covered
[31:03] i will acknowledge them
[31:08] but they're only covered
[31:11] they cannot be done away because that
[31:13] old testament saint could not have the
[31:15] new birth
[31:16] because jesus christ had not come and
[31:18] died yet that's right
[31:25] all right let's just read a few things i
[31:27] had these the other day and i went
[31:29] through a little of it but
[31:30] i want to make sure you get this thought
[31:34] of what i'm trying to bring
[31:44] i believe it has said that david
[31:48] experienced
[31:51] the love of god
[31:55] to set him free when even he
[32:00] called down judgment upon himself
[32:03] said let the man that's done this come
[32:05] and i'll kill him
[32:08] the prophet said david you're the man
[32:14] it wasn't repentance from david that he
[32:17] got caught up with
[32:18] that's what most people's repentance is
[32:21] you know no saying talk is cheap
[32:26] they say oh i'm sorry
[32:31] you know
[32:36] but what about an honest and a contrad
[32:38] heart that cries out to god
[32:41] now don't you think
[32:44] that the rest of david's life he thought
[32:46] about what he done
[32:51] and don't you realize that he spent the
[32:52] rest of his life preparing to build a
[32:55] temple
[32:57] that he would never build because he'd
[33:00] done been told
[33:03] he doesn't shed too much blood things
[33:05] was going on it wasn't too much blood
[33:07] that he battled the enemies
[33:10] god told him to go kill the enemies
[33:13] come on the blood was the thing that he
[33:16] done to cover his sin
[33:20] and he had a man killed here
[33:23] to cover his sin
[33:29] see then they think about it
[33:32] look what the prophet has to say here on
[33:35] the way
[33:36] number 12 i think it is which is
[33:39] believeth out of this
[33:41] 1951 1003.
[33:48] he said i'll not leave you comfortless
[33:51] but i'll pray the father and he sends
[33:53] you another comforter
[33:54] which is the holy spirit and he will
[33:56] abide with you
[33:58] all right
[34:02] why do we need a comforter if we don't
[34:04] have wrong
[34:06] why do we need an advocate if we don't
[34:08] do wrong
[34:14] look what he goes on to say
[34:18] so what kind of a people should we be
[34:21] then why we should be free and happy
[34:25] in my no condemnation living above sin
[34:29] and disgrace
[34:30] not by our own but by him see
[34:34] not what we are but what he is
[34:38] god don't accept me for what i am
[34:41] he accepts me for what christ has done
[34:44] for me
[34:46] right it isn't my holiness my
[34:49] righteousness
[34:50] it's his i have none to offer
[34:54] but i just accepted his
[34:57] amen so i know he's pleased with that
[35:00] listen for he said blessed
[35:03] is my beloved no i'm just saying it
[35:06] anyway this is my beloved son
[35:08] in whom i am well pleased
[35:11] that's talking about you he said no no
[35:13] not talking about him on him that's
[35:15] talking about you up here
[35:17] you know when god gave you the baptism
[35:19] of the holy ghost he said blessed
[35:20] he said you're blessed
[35:27] he gave you that holy ghost
[35:30] he said he was pleased to dwell in him
[35:34] right well no no that was just about
[35:37] jesus
[35:38] well okay
[35:45] see i believe that david was pointing
[35:49] toward
[35:51] the people who would receive the new
[35:53] birth
[35:57] i believe i've proved my point by the
[35:59] scriptures that
[36:00] if not then why would he be
[36:02] acknowledging in his sin
[36:06] he was pointing toward the new birth
[36:10] to a group of people that would receive
[36:14] jesus christ into their life
[36:19] and would put them into a position
[36:23] that david realized he was not in
[36:29] right
[36:33] all right pointing down to
[36:38] we think a special people that's why i
[36:41] just read this quote
[36:43] are we a special people
[36:47] are we some kind of great one bless god
[36:49] god wouldn't save me if i hadn't been
[36:51] like i was
[36:55] see one side says it this way i was so
[36:58] good god saved me
[37:02] the other side said i was so bad god
[37:05] save me
[37:08] neither one of them's right
[37:11] what do you see why i read this quote
[37:16] it's not looking at a special people
[37:20] it's looking at what god has made us
[37:25] remember brother collins always bore
[37:27] with me years ago we spoke on
[37:30] he's talking about it is he that hath
[37:32] made us
[37:33] and not we ourselves
[37:38] we're not anything special
[37:43] but there's one thing about it if the
[37:44] old testament was the apple of his eye
[37:49] right what does he think about the new
[37:51] testament
[37:52] sons and daughters
[37:56] he thinks a lot about us
[37:59] but yet is that supposed to make us the
[38:01] word that we can say well
[38:03] that don't matter you know
[38:06] oh dodea granddaddy it don't matter
[38:08] about but
[38:10] oh granddaddy he'll just take care of
[38:13] everything for us
[38:16] he's a dodea granddaddy well i'll do the
[38:19] best i can
[38:19] but it's not based on that way
[38:24] you see god looks at our heart today as
[38:28] well as he looked at the heart of david
[38:35] all right see it's what christ
[38:39] has done has made us a special people
[38:44] that god loves
[38:47] us because
[38:51] we desired to love him
[38:58] no he just picked out well that's what
[39:00] we think see
[39:06] no
[39:09] brother said god don't predestinate by
[39:11] his desires
[39:15] he said because he desired it everybody
[39:17] be saved
[39:22] but listen look what he says now talking
[39:25] about the new birth
[39:30] and remembering if it was so much that a
[39:32] man under the blood
[39:34] of bulls and goats could cry out for
[39:36] repentance
[39:39] that god would take that person and
[39:42] cover them
[39:46] right
[39:49] waiting until calvary where he could
[39:51] eradicate that sin
[39:54] right but yet he would cover them
[39:59] go bail them and say look what they're
[40:01] doing
[40:04] like just don't see a thing
[40:07] amen said they failed balaam fell to see
[40:12] the sacrifice the brazen altar the
[40:16] things
[40:17] that was keeping israel covered
[40:23] right blood atonement once a year
[40:28] to cover them to keep them from being
[40:31] killed
[40:32] for their sin
[40:36] regular atonement were made daily for
[40:39] things that was
[40:40] you know in life to be done
[40:44] but once a year they made an atonement
[40:47] it covered all israel you know what
[40:50] it even covered the bad ones
[40:54] because god didn't kill them
[40:57] remember the mixed multitude the bible
[40:59] speaks out they were the ones that
[41:01] caused all the trouble with israel
[41:03] yet god didn't destroy him he honored
[41:07] that
[41:08] he covered him
[41:12] you say well if he done that for them
[41:15] then i don't have to worry about it
[41:17] if you got that attitude you better
[41:18] start worrying about it
[41:20] that's just the best way to say it
[41:23] because if you try to have an attitude
[41:25] that there's no repentance
[41:26] needed
[41:30] then you got the wrong attitude even
[41:33] under the blood of bulls and goats they
[41:34] had the right attitude there was a
[41:36] repentance
[41:37] what should we be in the new birth
[41:41] yeah but brotherdale i just thought it
[41:43] made us so great
[41:46] well if it did it's what he done
[41:49] we don't have anything to do with it
[41:55] all right look what he said on the token
[41:58] message in 1964
[42:01] 308
[42:05] now the promises makes free from sin
[42:10] shows that god hasn't hasn't recognized
[42:13] your sin
[42:15] watch david said blessed is the man to
[42:18] whom god will not impute sin
[42:20] too now watch it
[42:24] and god will never impute sin over that
[42:27] token amen
[42:30] now the tokens are baptism of the holy
[42:32] ghost to the believer right
[42:37] come on he'll never impute sin over that
[42:41] token
[42:42] because the token is the paid sign that
[42:44] god has already received it
[42:49] remember the is the is the is instead of
[42:51] our
[42:54] all of the blessed is blessed is
[42:59] and you got the token part
[43:02] your faith has brought it
[43:05] and you have the purchase price of your
[43:07] redemption in your body
[43:09] to worship him and so forth his promises
[43:12] and power
[43:13] all right now
[43:17] if he gave you the new birth
[43:21] there's no way he can take it back do
[43:23] you need those quotes
[43:24] that god is not an indian giver to give
[43:26] it to you and then take it back away
[43:27] from you
[43:28] if he gave you the new birth then
[43:32] he's saying this is my beloved son in
[43:34] whom i'm pleased to dwell
[43:37] talking about you
[43:40] seeing that that token has been applied
[43:44] and if israel under the blood of bulls
[43:47] and goats the heifer
[43:48] that was given as the one atonement
[43:52] that god would not eradicate them
[43:57] right they were his people
[44:01] how much more would be the blood of
[44:03] jesus christ
[44:05] in the new birth
[44:12] so then i'm a firm believer in one thing
[44:16] you can't sin enough to be lost if
[44:19] you're born again
[44:22] but then who would want to go sin
[44:26] right does that give you a right just
[44:29] live like the devil now if you live like
[44:30] the devil you're the devil
[44:32] no problems right
[44:37] other people preach about grace and i
[44:39] just feel so good
[44:41] i just oh i just bubble well why is it
[44:43] the next day you're down at the mouth
[44:51] i thought the word was going to set us
[44:53] free
[44:57] i thought that's what we talked in the
[44:58] scripture about you shall know the truth
[45:00] and the truth will set you free
[45:05] but see it's not what we do
[45:09] it's what he's already done
[45:13] now remember if he couldn't destroy
[45:14] israel under a
[45:16] covering of the blood
[45:20] how much more is it in the new testament
[45:22] when
[45:23] he looks through red that red sees white
[45:32] but yet for us to think that we could go
[45:34] do what we desire to do
[45:37] and live of life of sin then we prove
[45:40] that we're lost
[45:42] that shouldn't be any problem he said
[45:45] brother dale are you telling
[45:47] me that i'm lost i'm telling you
[45:50] according to james
[45:53] right now according to james
[45:58] we have a right to look at what people
[46:01] do and don't do
[46:07] that was why he was putting that there
[46:11] that's why we started off there last
[46:14] week on what
[46:17] there is therefore now no condemnation
[46:19] to them that are in christ jesus romans
[46:21] 8 1
[46:23] who walk not after the flesh
[46:27] but after the spirit
[46:30] so then there's condemnation to those
[46:32] that walk after the flesh
[46:35] or you don't have no more consciousness
[46:37] in the snakes got hips
[46:43] this is a background for something i
[46:45] want to speak on
[46:47] so it's been a question in a lot of your
[46:49] minds and
[46:51] it stays in my mind all the time too i
[46:56] have an odd way of approaching it so
[46:57] just bear with me
[46:59] but remember when i get up there and say
[47:02] this i'll say
[47:04] you amend this one
[47:10] all right so
[47:14] better be old me all right
[47:17] now listen what it means to be this
[47:20] person
[47:21] go to a number 14.
[47:26] look what it means to be this person
[47:29] that david is speaking of that paul is
[47:31] speaking up from the message the seat of
[47:33] discrepancy
[47:34] 65 118 paragraph 27
[47:38] 28 we find out god gave his children his
[47:42] word for their defense
[47:46] we have no defense no other defense
[47:49] defense than the word of god
[47:52] there's our defense brother random said
[47:55] if you can find it in the word
[47:59] he said you can call god on the scene
[48:02] and say if you don't bring it
[48:04] forth you are a liar
[48:08] now that was a strong one for me
[48:13] you mean you're gonna tell god he's a
[48:14] liar no you don't have to because you
[48:16] ain't gonna have
[48:18] opportunity
[48:25] no bomb shelters no nothing we don't
[48:26] worry about that
[48:28] look not even sin is imputed what
[48:32] to a genuine believer
[48:37] why if it is that the the sin couldn't
[48:41] be imputed
[48:42] under the old testament because it was
[48:44] covered by the blood
[48:47] why would it not be in the new testament
[48:49] that there'd be no sin with nobody
[49:00] come on are you thinking
[49:03] and there is no sin in the new testament
[49:08] we make ourselves sinners
[49:12] there is no sin a sinner is not
[49:15] condemned today
[49:18] he's going to get a judgment day
[49:24] why because god's not looking at it like
[49:26] we look at it
[49:28] right
[49:31] not even sin is imputed to a genuine
[49:33] believer
[49:34] did you know that he that's born of god
[49:36] does not commit sin
[49:38] he cannot sin see it's not even imputed
[49:43] why david said blessed is the man
[49:46] who god will not impute sin when you're
[49:49] in christ
[49:50] you have no desire to sin the worst
[49:53] person
[49:54] were once purged
[49:57] has no more conscience of sin you don't
[49:59] desire it
[50:01] to the world you're a sinner and
[50:02] everything how can you be a sinner
[50:05] when you're in the sinless one and god
[50:08] only sees him
[50:09] who you are in
[50:14] so then there's not even sin to the
[50:16] world see we look around
[50:18] look at that box of centers
[50:21] we've got some quotes when we get in
[50:24] here
[50:28] sinners don't sin right
[50:33] boy well
[50:36] right they're just sinners that's right
[50:40] and you go around condemning people for
[50:42] doing what they're supposed to do
[50:46] and may i make it plainer we condemn
[50:48] them for doing what they're supposed to
[50:50] do
[50:50] that we used to do but we don't want
[50:53] that brought up
[50:57] right we don't want that bro now
[51:10] yet we're real bad to condemn everybody
[51:12] else
[51:14] and like i always say to you you know
[51:17] people will say
[51:18] well brother dale i don't see why people
[51:20] can't see it because i've seen it
[51:21] immediately
[51:23] and i remember it took me about six or
[51:24] eight months maybe a year to get you to
[51:26] see it
[51:29] but you saw it immediately
[51:33] sorry too 73 year old but i still got a
[51:37] good memory
[51:41] sometimes i wish i could forget
[51:45] but if you're in christ there's no way
[51:48] to commute
[51:49] impute sin to christ
[51:55] can you say he's a sinner no
[51:59] because he can't be imputed if you're
[52:04] born again christian
[52:06] look what he said on the token 1963 903
[52:09] the morning service paragraph 333
[52:12] 334
[52:15] he talked about a super super super
[52:17] super life that was in him
[52:19] comes back upon you and changes you from
[52:21] a sinner and the things of the world
[52:23] a church member see that's what we used
[52:25] to be a denominational gore
[52:29] to what to a born-again christian filled
[52:32] with the spirit the life of god just
[52:34] flowing from you
[52:35] like sparks from an anvil as you walk
[52:37] full of virtue and love and gentleness
[52:40] and there's the holy spirit moving
[52:41] speaking oh my there you are
[52:44] and with the what hearing the message
[52:48] watching the pillar of fire and the
[52:50] blessed assurance
[52:52] of past from death unto life note
[52:55] therefore no condemnation at all
[53:00] hearing the message
[53:05] now if a prophet
[53:08] i don't understand about a lot of
[53:09] people's thoughts if a prophet like
[53:12] there who was it was it nathan that come
[53:14] to david and said you won't die
[53:16] uh he said could i pray for you
[53:22] you know what i i'm glad to hear the
[53:24] prayers of the prophet a lot of times
[53:26] what about you
[53:29] when i realize he's praying for me
[53:36] prophet's words before god got a lot of
[53:39] of uh
[53:40] bearing as we'd call it or whatever you
[53:42] know
[53:44] but see i don't i don't see why we can't
[53:46] consider though that
[53:47] that our prayers are also before god
[53:51] and there's a lot of bearing that goes
[53:52] with the the prior
[53:55] is it earnest sincere or how you say
[53:58] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[54:02] why can't we believe that god hears our
[54:05] prayers
[54:09] pray for your children but look how bad
[54:11] they're doing
[54:12] that means you've got more to pray for
[54:16] that's when you want to pray harder amen
[54:19] amen
[54:22] right well let them get straightened up
[54:25] and then everything will be all right
[54:27] well you you're not even a parent let
[54:29] alone anything else let alone a
[54:30] christian
[54:31] you're not even a human being that's
[54:32] that's worth thinking
[54:35] let them come and say to they're sorry
[54:37] to me then i'll i'll pray for them now
[54:39] that's
[54:40] a very poor human being can i put it
[54:43] that away
[54:46] but now listen no condemnation
[54:51] the bible says to them that are in
[54:52] christ jesus
[54:57] all right now
[55:01] i have a lot of quotes here about the
[55:03] things
[55:04] that the prophet has said
[55:09] well let's just bypass a little of it
[55:11] and get down to our thought because
[55:13] we're trying to bring it if you're a
[55:16] christian a born-again christian
[55:20] you're under the blood of jesus christ
[55:24] all right but why would we trample on
[55:28] the blood of christ
[55:30] in any form whatsoever to think it's all
[55:34] right
[55:34] and we don't need to repent
[55:42] according to my bible i think we talk
[55:44] about it as being
[55:45] you know there in the scripture word
[55:48] about speaking the word
[55:51] and and it says first to be
[55:54] repentant
[55:58] well brother devil you mean
[56:01] yeah i believe brother branham was a
[56:03] very very very repentant person
[56:08] now according to him and what he said
[56:10] one day he said he lived so close to god
[56:13] until it forced that gift to work now do
[56:16] you need that quote
[56:18] in other words he prayed he fasted he
[56:21] stayed before the lord
[56:22] now he said he'd never fasted over three
[56:24] days in his life
[56:26] but a lot of people don't understand
[56:27] about him they think he fasted 40
[56:29] he says no such thing in the bible it's
[56:31] a 40-day fast
[56:33] the lord jesus was the only one that
[56:35] went with a 40-day fast
[56:36] but he said he would fast like one meal
[56:39] you know
[56:40] et cetera then he was coming up to a
[56:42] meeting
[56:43] you know getting ready he would fast a
[56:44] few days but he said i never fasted over
[56:46] three days my life
[56:49] see fasting is to get yourself out of
[56:51] the way
[56:54] and in doing that then he would pray
[56:57] before
[56:58] god and god would hear him
[57:01] all right well see we think that's
[57:05] only for him why
[57:12] why
[57:16] yeah but the lord tells me something
[57:18] lord told me years ago why he was coming
[57:20] back
[57:22] that made me pray harder than ever
[57:28] then when he told me one day he was
[57:29] going to be standing in the pulpit with
[57:31] me preaching
[57:32] that really did make me pray it still
[57:36] makes me pray
[57:40] amen i don't know what he's got to go
[57:43] through with
[57:47] but you see we just take things too
[57:49] haphazardly
[57:50] and a lot of the quotes that i've got
[57:52] here that you're under the blood
[57:54] that your attorney is not only your
[57:55] attorney but he's your judge
[57:58] not only that but christians deal only
[58:01] as spiritual things
[58:03] we're not supposed to be dealing with
[58:04] natural
[58:06] and all of these is blessed is the man
[58:08] to whom god will not impute sin
[58:12] but i hope i've laid down enough to get
[58:15] to this point
[58:17] because this is the hardest thing
[58:18] seemingly to explain
[58:23] the christian sin
[58:31] and if they do how do they do it or what
[58:34] does it or what goes wrong
[58:39] now if i asked a blanket question across
[58:44] to you right now and i say what is sin
[58:47] what are you going to say unbelief
[58:50] right
[58:53] now i've tried my best for 40 years to
[58:56] explain this
[59:01] i've been condemned of every form and
[59:03] thoughts of it people saying well what
[59:04] are you trying to explain body spirit
[59:06] and soul
[59:06] we're just a unit
[59:10] that's true we're a unit called body
[59:12] spirit and soul
[59:18] but what are you trying to say we're
[59:19] just a unit are you saying the whole
[59:21] unit does wrong
[59:27] that's why we get back into more
[59:28] scripture but according to the little
[59:30] john's it says
[59:31] that his seed remaineth in us and we
[59:33] cannot sin
[59:38] amen does that mean i can't sin
[59:46] when the prophet says we sin every day
[59:49] and what are you going to do with it
[59:55] if you think paul and and
[59:58] james sounds contradictory
[1:00:02] what are you going to do with the bible
[1:00:04] telling you that you're a sinner
[1:00:07] and if you don't admit you're a sinner
[1:00:09] you're a liar
[1:00:12] amen and then turn around tell you you
[1:00:14] can't sin
[1:00:19] now that sounds a little bit
[1:00:20] contradictory
[1:00:25] you know what does that sound like that
[1:00:29] god can't keep it straight
[1:00:33] but we know that's not true amen
[1:00:39] but how long did it take us to find out
[1:00:41] that
[1:00:42] james wasn't contrary to paul
[1:00:47] it took a profit right
[1:00:50] that's right
[1:00:53] it takes a profit to break down an
[1:00:55] individual
[1:00:57] to where we can see what's going on
[1:01:07] the prophet of god will say we sin every
[1:01:10] day
[1:01:12] and he said it's totally impossible
[1:01:16] for a christian to sin
[1:01:23] which one do you want
[1:01:31] i want an understanding of what's going
[1:01:32] on
[1:01:36] and in trying to do that i've tried to
[1:01:38] explain
[1:01:41] an individual in the thoughts
[1:01:44] you know go ahead to 18 8 brother and
[1:01:48] let's pull these
[1:01:49] a couple of these up then we'll run a
[1:01:50] few and then we'll
[1:01:52] we'll have to continue this this evening
[1:01:54] but we will continue
[1:01:56] this evening but this is from the
[1:01:59] message continuing for the fight 56
[1:02:02] uh two and these were not on the line so
[1:02:05] i'll have to find where we're at
[1:02:07] but you'll get down to where he says we
[1:02:09] uh
[1:02:11] we're tempted all of us are tempted
[1:02:15] all of us sin all right where's that
[1:02:18] okay we got it underlined all right
[1:02:22] i'm shooting these two of them it's
[1:02:24] light in there you know i've worked them
[1:02:25] guys a lot in there and i appreciate
[1:02:27] them
[1:02:27] i'll go in there and give them a whole
[1:02:29] layout when i go back 18 a
[1:02:31] 18 b 18 c they they got to go back
[1:02:35] separate all of it and put in what
[1:02:37] i appreciate them all right
[1:02:40] we're tempted all of us are tempted
[1:02:44] all of us sin
[1:02:49] there's none without sin
[1:02:54] every day you sin
[1:02:57] paul said he had to die daily
[1:03:02] now who had ever thought that if a
[1:03:03] prophet hadn't said did we think paul
[1:03:05] saying i died daily
[1:03:07] i mean he was doing wrong daily
[1:03:10] we just think it means i die i die i die
[1:03:13] i die
[1:03:13] and then we die enough we did yeah
[1:03:17] see and if we say we have no sin
[1:03:23] then the bible says we make
[1:03:27] god to lie is that the scripture
[1:03:32] over in the little john's
[1:03:37] and we could not do that so we sin daily
[1:03:42] and it's god's grace that saves us
[1:03:45] and as we confess our wrongs god's just
[1:03:48] to forgive them
[1:03:50] in your your confession as long as it
[1:03:52] holds good
[1:03:54] your salvation is perfect
[1:03:57] same is with divine healing
[1:04:00] if your personal faith interests your
[1:04:02] personal faith all right now i didn't
[1:04:03] give them this one
[1:04:05] but i'll give it to you off the message
[1:04:08] hebrews
[1:04:09] chapter 6 paragraph 262
[1:04:13] 263 57 909
[1:04:18] paul is explaining therefore leaving the
[1:04:20] principles of doctrine of christ
[1:04:22] let us go into perfection we got that
[1:04:24] this morning
[1:04:25] now that we are perfected
[1:04:30] perfected
[1:04:33] absolutely spotless
[1:04:37] and blindless
[1:04:43] are you listening
[1:04:48] i gotta okay i figured they'd beat me
[1:04:52] if i goofed off enough they'd find it
[1:04:57] look how that we are perfected
[1:05:01] perfected absolutely spotless and
[1:05:06] blindless
[1:05:08] not one sin in us
[1:05:12] see on us
[1:05:16] are you above temptation never
[1:05:20] do you sin every day yes sir
[1:05:25] but yet we are perfected because we're
[1:05:28] in him
[1:05:30] and god could no more judge us than
[1:05:32] nothing
[1:05:34] couldn't be righteous or he couldn't be
[1:05:35] righteous he's already judged us in him
[1:05:38] when he judged christ he judged me he
[1:05:41] judge you
[1:05:42] and he can't judge you again because he
[1:05:44] took my judgment
[1:05:46] i've been redeemed i've been taken out
[1:05:49] of the pawnshop
[1:05:51] right right now two statements
[1:05:55] emphatically stating that we've seen
[1:05:59] every day
[1:06:00] that he said he did
[1:06:07] but now he goes on to like on the wings
[1:06:10] of snow white dove
[1:06:12] number 18 now
[1:06:16] and that's the way it is with a real
[1:06:17] christian did you know a real christian
[1:06:19] doesn't have even any sin at all
[1:06:22] imputed to him david said blessed is a
[1:06:25] man
[1:06:28] who god will not impute sin
[1:06:32] when you're washed in the blood of the
[1:06:33] lamb not
[1:06:35] make by make belief but really the blood
[1:06:38] of the lamb
[1:06:40] god does not impute to you anything
[1:06:42] that's done
[1:06:47] because you're under the blood and he
[1:06:49] doesn't see it
[1:06:55] he said that was done once the only
[1:06:58] thing he can see
[1:07:00] you in is the way he saw
[1:07:03] you before the world
[1:07:07] foundation of the world when he put your
[1:07:09] name on the lounge book of life
[1:07:13] that's all you can look at
[1:07:16] because you're redeemed from everything
[1:07:18] that was ever done
[1:07:19] you're washed in the blood of the lamb
[1:07:22] therefore there's no guile
[1:07:24] in you there's no unclean habit in you
[1:07:28] because the blood of the lamb has did
[1:07:29] this and god cannot impute sin to you
[1:07:32] after
[1:07:33] you've got a sin offering laying there
[1:07:35] waiting for you
[1:07:37] well you say that gives me plenty of
[1:07:39] room then brother branham
[1:07:41] i can do what i want to he said i always
[1:07:44] do
[1:07:46] always but when a man can really see
[1:07:50] what jesus done for him and turn around
[1:07:53] and do something wrong
[1:07:55] or something country to him it shows
[1:07:58] he never received christ
[1:08:07] look at the next one number 19.
[1:08:10] which is questions and answers 59 uh
[1:08:13] 629
[1:08:17] i know they're putting it up there but
[1:08:21] look what he says we're by one spirit
[1:08:23] we're all baptized into one body
[1:08:25] and free from sin we cannot sin
[1:08:29] there is an atonement waiting for us and
[1:08:32] if there is still desire in your heart
[1:08:33] to sin
[1:08:35] you have never been baptized into that
[1:08:36] body because you're dead and your life
[1:08:39] is hid
[1:08:40] in christ through god and sealed by the
[1:08:42] holy ghost
[1:08:43] christians don't sin they make mistakes
[1:08:49] they don't sin amen that's the reason
[1:08:54] they don't for he cannot sin
[1:08:58] they make mistakes number twenty
[1:09:03] hebrews chapter six part 3 57
[1:09:06] 9 15 in the morning you'll make mistakes
[1:09:11] you'll fall
[1:09:16] anybody reading that right you'll
[1:09:20] willfully do wrong
[1:09:24] no but the bible says
[1:09:27] if you sin willfully
[1:09:32] the prophet says you willfully
[1:09:36] you go out sometime and do things
[1:09:39] that don't mean you're lost that means
[1:09:42] you're going to get correction
[1:09:44] amen he says where
[1:09:48] it's impossible for that man to ever be
[1:09:50] born again that's one's been born of
[1:09:52] eternal life
[1:09:54] ever ever be gone again
[1:09:57] that's once been born of eternal life
[1:10:00] god is not an ending giver
[1:10:03] you don't do that look at the next one
[1:10:06] 21
[1:10:07] questions and answers 1959 6 28
[1:10:10] evening will you please explain what it
[1:10:12] means by
[1:10:13] sinneth not in first john 5 18
[1:10:17] did we know that whosoever is born of
[1:10:19] god sent us not
[1:10:21] certainly not i just went through that
[1:10:24] he can't sin he's born of god
[1:10:25] sin is not he cannot sin the seed
[1:10:28] remains in him
[1:10:29] another scripture you might refer to
[1:10:31] here would be romans
[1:10:32] 4 8 which is really 5 8 4 4 5 and 8
[1:10:36] coming through
[1:10:38] where david spoke we're gone david spoke
[1:10:41] over there years ago
[1:10:43] and said blessed is the man whom god
[1:10:45] will not impute sin
[1:10:46] because he does not sin
[1:10:50] let's go the other way number 22
[1:10:54] paragraph 129 questions and answers 59
[1:10:57] 6 28 in the evening new christian sin
[1:11:00] absolutely no now watch there is no
[1:11:03] scripture where a christian sins
[1:11:06] he cannot sin i know that's a resentment
[1:11:09] to that
[1:11:11] i know there's a resentment we'll we'll
[1:11:14] go over here to first john and see what
[1:11:15] the scripture says
[1:11:17] a christian does not see him did you
[1:11:19] ever see a black white bird
[1:11:23] or a white black bird you ever see a
[1:11:25] drunk silver man
[1:11:26] nope he never did see a sinner saying
[1:11:29] either
[1:11:32] backwards and four backwards and four
[1:11:36] why because he's born of god and he
[1:11:38] cannot sin
[1:11:40] it goes down to adoption 23
[1:11:45] which is preached in 1960 5 22 the
[1:11:48] morning service
[1:11:48] program 56 remember life's wednesday
[1:11:51] night
[1:11:52] no christian christian sin
[1:11:55] but a sinner cannot sin
[1:12:00] senator can't sin he's already a sinner
[1:12:06] he ain't going to hell for cutting your
[1:12:08] hair paint in your face
[1:12:10] that's what everybody teaches you're
[1:12:13] going to hell for one thing
[1:12:15] and that's unbelief
[1:12:22] got much more but we'll stop and just
[1:12:24] get the point
[1:12:28] then it looks like the bible is saying
[1:12:32] that you sin then the bible says you
[1:12:35] can't sin
[1:12:37] it looks like the prophet is saying you
[1:12:39] sin
[1:12:40] and then says you can't sin
[1:12:44] now are we gonna uh
[1:12:47] well over here it says this and i'll
[1:12:50] just rip out that page
[1:12:55] that don't work does it okay we take a
[1:12:58] profit
[1:12:59] well i'll read this one but i'll read
[1:13:01] that one
[1:13:06] we turn out to be bad people doing that
[1:13:09] called hypocrites
[1:13:13] would you say brother dale
[1:13:19] what is the truth of it
[1:13:22] the truth of it is that if god comes and
[1:13:26] lives in you that we read
[1:13:29] is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:13:32] that's the seed of god the new birth
[1:13:35] and that seed cannot sin
[1:13:39] because it's born of god inside of that
[1:13:43] soul is eternal life
[1:13:45] and you can never do wrong all right
[1:13:49] but outside is body and spirit that is
[1:13:53] still under satan's domain
[1:13:56] right so if i do wrong paul
[1:14:00] you do wrong he said i die daily but
[1:14:03] around you do wrong he said
[1:14:04] sin daily is that word sin
[1:14:12] only one definition
[1:14:19] is that word sin the only definition
[1:14:22] that you apply to it
[1:14:23] is unbelief
[1:14:28] the bible said he that sinned willfully
[1:14:30] after receiving the knowledge of the
[1:14:31] prophet said you willfully do wrong
[1:14:36] or boy you've confused us now i hadn't
[1:14:38] confused you he's already confused
[1:14:40] because if you didn't
[1:14:40] know the answer to it that's the
[1:14:42] confusion
[1:14:44] what a man said one time not speaking he
[1:14:46] said i hate it when that man speaks
[1:14:49] he's the only one who had to answer i
[1:14:51] said if i hadn't had an answer i
[1:14:53] wouldn't have been speaking
[1:14:55] i wouldn't have been talking if i had
[1:14:56] the answer huh
[1:14:59] all right so then sin has to be defined
[1:15:05] as not just always being unbelief
[1:15:10] because if it's unbelievable i'll die
[1:15:11] and go to hell
[1:15:17] over in the scripture there's a
[1:15:18] scripture that i wanted to get to but
[1:15:24] first john 5 7 16.
[1:15:28] the bible says there is a sin
[1:15:32] that's not unto death
[1:15:37] if you look up that same word as in the
[1:15:40] same scripture it says there's a sin
[1:15:42] that's not unto death
[1:15:44] the same verse says that there is a sin
[1:15:47] unto death
[1:15:48] okay if any man see his brother sin or
[1:15:51] sin
[1:15:52] which is not unto death
[1:15:56] so there's a sin not unto death go look
[1:15:58] up at that word sin
[1:15:59] and then look up that word sin down here
[1:16:02] i'm going to give you the same
[1:16:04] definition
[1:16:07] so we line that up we brought around and
[1:16:08] said sin is unbelief
[1:16:11] well brother branham you're an
[1:16:13] unbeliever because you said you sinned
[1:16:18] now we go back to where he said
[1:16:20] christians
[1:16:21] make mistakes right
[1:16:25] and even willfully will make mistakes
[1:16:29] knowing better
[1:16:34] if you see his brother sent a sin that
[1:16:35] is not unto death he shall ask and he
[1:16:37] shall give unto him
[1:16:39] give him life for them that sin not unto
[1:16:42] death
[1:16:42] that means you can ask for your kids if
[1:16:46] you see them out there living and wrong
[1:16:47] and doing wrong
[1:16:49] go ask for them because they ain't
[1:16:52] blasphemed the holy ghost yet
[1:16:55] sure they're unbelievers it ain't
[1:16:57] blasphemed
[1:16:59] there is a sin unto death i do not say
[1:17:04] that he shall pray for it
[1:17:08] so there's got to be a defining and i
[1:17:10] know people won't like that i don't have
[1:17:11] any other words
[1:17:12] sorry no edu education i'm not slew and
[1:17:15] suave like all of these other
[1:17:17] preachers i just say it like i believe
[1:17:19] it
[1:17:21] so it must be that there is a sin that
[1:17:23] is totally unbelief
[1:17:27] and when you cross that line there's no
[1:17:29] hopes of getting back
[1:17:34] that is unbelief
[1:17:37] but then there's life living in earth
[1:17:41] that is sin
[1:17:45] that is not unto death
[1:17:49] but it's daily things we do
[1:17:54] speed get upset
[1:18:02] eat too much oh we don't want to get on
[1:18:07] that do we
[1:18:09] you know it's a sin to eat too much you
[1:18:11] need a long sermon on that about
[1:18:13] how the world is starving to death and
[1:18:15] we're packing it down
[1:18:22] okay so there must be something about
[1:18:26] that little word sin that we need a
[1:18:28] revelation of
[1:18:30] amen that we can see
[1:18:33] that we do things ourselves wrong
[1:18:38] that we ought not to do and we ask god
[1:18:40] to forgive us for it
[1:18:44] right that don't mean you're an
[1:18:47] unbeliever
[1:18:51] come on brother random power they
[1:18:53] unbelievers
[1:18:55] or were they human beings that was
[1:18:57] living in the world
[1:18:58] that their soul is sealed in and cannot
[1:19:01] do wrong
[1:19:02] but the body and the spirit is still in
[1:19:04] this world realm
[1:19:06] and you're fighting it out now you call
[1:19:07] it just a unit you call it a unit and
[1:19:09] you're gonna make everybody die and go
[1:19:11] to hell
[1:19:11] even the prophet and paul too because we
[1:19:14] got both of them where they said they'd
[1:19:15] do wrong
[1:19:17] and called it sin
[1:19:21] but you see that's where we just get an
[1:19:23] idea yes
[1:19:26] we get a thought well we're just a unit
[1:19:28] well then where do you sin
[1:19:29] from if you're a christian that's right
[1:19:36] now we're not we don't i i've got to
[1:19:39] quote
[1:19:39] here okay the prophet said we don't have
[1:19:41] to sin okay
[1:19:43] so we we keep that straight all right we
[1:19:46] don't say we have to
[1:19:48] we just can't help it ah now don't go
[1:19:52] that route
[1:19:54] you don't have to sin
[1:19:58] we sin willfully then
[1:20:03] and be careful because you're
[1:20:05] borderlining it
[1:20:08] because if you drop on over there's no
[1:20:10] more sacrifice
[1:20:16] you see church then even that scripture
[1:20:19] we send willful after receiving the
[1:20:21] knowledge of truth that remains no more
[1:20:22] sacrifice
[1:20:25] i've tried to explain that scripture and
[1:20:27] got into trouble about it
[1:20:30] you realize if you or me we do something
[1:20:33] wrong
[1:20:33] and we do not repent of that
[1:20:38] there is going to be a judgment day not
[1:20:41] deciding whether you're going to heaven
[1:20:42] or not
[1:20:43] right that's the white throne judgment
[1:20:46] there's another judgment of the deeds
[1:20:47] done in the body
[1:20:48] and we don't get rid of them here we're
[1:20:50] going to answer there right
[1:20:52] there is no sacrifice do you get that
[1:20:54] scripture
[1:20:56] have you ever thought of it on that side
[1:20:58] he that sins will have to receive the
[1:21:00] knowledge of the truth that remains no
[1:21:01] more sacrifice
[1:21:02] i go out and do something wrong to
[1:21:04] brother colley and i won't go back and
[1:21:05] apologize to him
[1:21:08] i'm going to give an account for that
[1:21:10] one day
[1:21:13] because i don't have an automatic
[1:21:15] covering to keep me covered
[1:21:18] i do have the blood of jesus christ to
[1:21:20] keep me from being lost
[1:21:23] but i don't have it to just go around
[1:21:26] and do anything in the world
[1:21:30] that scripture is exactly right there
[1:21:33] remaineth no more sacrifice
[1:21:35] there's not a sacrifice to cover us if
[1:21:38] we do wrong as christians
[1:21:41] now you understand what i mean the
[1:21:43] repentance is what keeps it from being
[1:21:45] there
[1:21:47] not an automatic covering well well i
[1:21:49] know i was bad back there but
[1:21:52] well i'm over here on a new birth now
[1:21:57] i know i'm driving this brand new
[1:21:59] cadillac that i stole last week
[1:22:02] but i don't need to take it back because
[1:22:03] i'm a christian now
[1:22:06] oh yeah brother motor always said if you
[1:22:10] steal a man's horse take his horse back
[1:22:13] it's the best way to get rid of things
[1:22:16] do you understand what i'm trying to say
[1:22:21] what is sin
[1:22:24] a christian cannot sin from his soul
[1:22:28] but he can do wrong in his body and flat
[1:22:30] and spirit of course the body is nothing
[1:22:32] without the spirit so it's
[1:22:33] all going back into the spirit realm
[1:22:42] make the life statement brother ronald
[1:22:45] said
[1:22:46] adam had eternal life
[1:22:50] in his soul
[1:22:54] and he sold us all into sin
[1:22:58] that's your prophet blasphemous names go
[1:23:00] read it
[1:23:04] adam had eternal life well now if he had
[1:23:07] eternal life you're going to put eve out
[1:23:09] of it
[1:23:10] when they had the same soul theophany do
[1:23:13] we need to quote brother right now
[1:23:21] what about at church
[1:23:24] what is sin well that's just unbelief
[1:23:28] well i'm looking at the most unbelievers
[1:23:30] in the world right here
[1:23:32] and then i turn around to see myself i
[1:23:34] don't have a mirror but i guess i can
[1:23:35] get a reflection
[1:23:37] you know because that's all we are
[1:23:41] we're about to sit and save by grace
[1:23:47] but when i do wrong i want to cry and
[1:23:49] say god forgive me
[1:23:51] forgive me lord
[1:23:55] he said we make mistakes he said you
[1:23:58] didn't really do that
[1:24:04] see that's that old husband we've talked
[1:24:06] about quite a while
[1:24:08] trying to raise back up that still lives
[1:24:10] in this body
[1:24:12] and spirit that i'm dwelling within only
[1:24:15] the lord jesus
[1:24:16] had his under complete control
[1:24:19] that's right
[1:24:23] i think on these times 12 o'clock let's
[1:24:25] stand we won't sing
[1:24:26] we'll just be dismissed remember the
[1:24:28] service this afternoon
[1:24:31] lord jesus we thank you
[1:24:35] we ask you now that you'd go with us
[1:24:36] we'll go and eat natural meals

[1:24:43] talking about you
[1:24:45] and we love you father and we thank you
[1:24:47] but most of all we love you for
[1:24:49] revealing your truth
[1:24:51] because that truth can set us free
[1:24:56] then i can be as paul said with my
[1:24:59] inward man i can serve you lord but with
[1:25:02] the outward man he said i
[1:25:04] serve the law of sin not that he was a
[1:25:07] sinner like
[1:25:08] unbelief
[1:25:11] but yet he was just a human being living
[1:25:13] in the world
[1:25:15] and us having problems
[1:25:18] just help us now god has to bless us in
[1:25:21] your love
[1:25:23] in jesus name if anybody has a need

[1:26:07] hands on her

[1:26:11] stripes he's healed
[1:26:12] we condemn this hurting in the name of
