but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is a the Lord and the Lord spake unto the feast and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land all right let's go to John 16 and we'll go to about verse 26 and begin reading I wish you would read this back above and get the point you know of what he's bringing to but we'll just start at verse 26 he says at that day you shall ask in my name and I will say unto you that I will pray the Father for you for the father himself love with you because you have loved me and have believed that I came out from God I came forth from the father and him coming to the world again I leave the world and go to the father his disciples said unto Him lo now speak us now plainly and speakest no parables now are we sure that down knowest all things indeed it's not that any man should ask thee by this we believe and once by this we believe that thou camest forth from God jesus answered them do you now believe you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now what about all the way through in the place he had come to in this writing and all of what we're talking about in a position that they finally said we believe huh and he said well do you now believe see as we bring the thoughts that we've been at it of bringing salvation and talking about it in trying to end up the Old Testament and this message is kind of just like a wedge to go between the old and the New Testament in our understanding so we can follow the point to really get you know the meaning of her or what I'm trying to get across to you all right because see the Lord Jesus actually came you know between the old and the new testament all right see a lot of people say you say turn to the first book of the New Testament he'll turn to Matthew well that's not so it's the book of Acts all right let's see in his life and time up you know from his birth to Calvary is dealing with the Old Testament form in the basis that you know he's talking to those people back there about salvation now he hasn't come to pay the price yet but yet he has told them about these things and that's what we've been trying to you know accomplish in dealing with so much on Abraham and talking about the father of faith and and the things and trying to get to a basis to really see you know about salvation cuz remember now how we've emphasized salvation it's bad it was back there in the Old Testament alright we know it we we see those things we see that those people experienced great mighty things all right and it provided of salvation for them that gave them a thing to that they would be even be call the people of God you know the children of God and all like that and they would would come through in their experiences and it provided a place for them to go to when they passed away it made a position there for them are a place of abode to where the soul could go until Jesus Christ came and then he went there and picked them up all right now so then salvation no matter whether it be the old are the testament I've emphasized over and over and I want to keep emphasizing that that you can't have a saw one salvation back here and then a different salvation over here it has to be the same for him to be Hebrews 13:8 all right now the the this back in the Old Testament we went through it over and over and over to what it was types and shatters because it never reached a fold in to the basis of their salvation all right now listen to the point them getting up see their salvation involved the basis of as I said to where they could go it to a place if they died in things but it never brought to them or a true eternal life in to their soul it only brought them to a confession right it brought them to a great point but it never brought that to them so the Old Testament could not bring eternal life into being into the people because Jesus Christ would have to come and pay the price that could go back and cover them because the Bible said he died once for all all right so he died for the sins of the people of the Old Testament the blood of bulls and goats and things that they done it could not remit sin so what it done it just kept pushing in as we call it pushing it forward until Jesus Christ came and paid the price then the sins could be remitted alright now then on that basis we we talked about that the time and the life of Jesus Christ upon the earth was sitting between the Old Testament and the New Testament alright and it would be to the basis that you know it would bring into reality and then keep saying it were you remember it that it provided a place for that person they're sold or being what they were to go to a position that could hold them and keep them you know until the finishing up of what would take place alright but see it couldn't bring a total deliverance right and we're only looking forward to but look at the difference now now it's not a difference between the Old Testament the Old Testament salvation was holding them keeping them in the right place but New Testament now when we get to that we'll see that it's not just keeping us the New Testament brings eternal life into being now all right by the new birth into each one of us now all right now truly then salvation is of the Lord whether it be the Old Testament or whether it be the New Testament and that would make him Hebrews 13:8 making all of that speaking of what would come into being by the new birth all right now because it would would run into a position but now I want to just take the thought of what the disciples all right now because I want you to think now this is what I want you to think women's or not I want you to think back in your life you know as to where you began in your Christianity all right I just want you to kind of let your mind run in the line of thinking of your Christianity and how that it's come to where it is today okay the COPE that away the point I want you to do is to anchor it in one thing it was not salvation in the Old Testament just for everybody right I've never I didn't believe that in the Baptist and I certainly don't believe it now I don't believe that every time they took a lamb in a manager walk up with a lamb just nuns a lot boy it down and say offer that lamb for me I'm going back and live you know like a well-being I never believed that like I can't see that because I look at the sincerity because if you're gonna do it that way why didn't he save everybody in the Old Testament all right yeah but those who believed him and accepted him as to their thinking for the time is what I want you to think about I know this has been about three messages on believing but you're going to see it tied together the Lord willing I hope when we drop over into and get it into the new birth and the things all right because now why would Jesus he was expressing to the disciples some things and they said okay we now believe that you know you are left on this quota many other scriptures all right because as many of them that would say we know that thou art the Christ you remember that the disciples said that we know that that you come from God we know this we know that about you because we believe it and the Bible speaks heavily of believing you know that a lot of times the fire sees it would be listed of the fire sees or some of them and it would say that they believe but then why did they not go on to receiving their salvation so then we need to think a lot about the word believing and then the Bible speaks of believing and he that believeth which would bring it into Pais tense different things to do so the disciples said okay now we believe you're the Lord believe that's we you know as I said putting a lot of scriptures into one lump sum we see that the people would come to a position of believing and they would move up a little now when the disciples first heard of the Lord Jesus would they have dared to had said we believe you come from God the first time Nicodemus you remember he said we believe that you come from God but do you believe that he believed that when he first heard of the name Jesus no when probably Nicodemus first heard of Jesus he was probably upset and wanted to get rid of him no but yet after a while he begin to realize that there was this man was and he said we believe you come from God but did that save him no but yet it was greater than what he had believed when he originally started now are you thinking about your experience you remember when you first want to remember your young you know like were born and raised in church but do you remember your experiences in church and going to church and going to Sunday School and going to you remember your teachers you remember the things and you remember you had little plays and you had a little this or you have a little of that and you you went on and after a while you grow it into more believing so see that's our problem when you say believe basically everybody says I believe well why does it not produce salvation now the Bible says you know we'll get back in those things and what is in romans that if you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that you're saved well you know there's millions on record of churches that have went up and made that statement and said we believe and we accept Jesus Christ as our Savior but then to go back into the world what's wrong did he not even have any believing no that's where we look at it in the wrong way we're going to try to define if we can - now if we don't we pick up Sunday that there's a vast difference between believe and believeth the vast difference between the two there's a difference between our mental faith our confessions and a spiritual revelation right now but here's where the problem is no matter what you have of what you want to call the level of this this this I'm here I believe this I believe that no matter what you have you begin that by believing you begin it by believe it somebody talked to you about God you heard a preacher you some something happen that triggered your thoughts about God and you started believing well you know what we're going to get to and I'm certainly gonna just drop a bombshell on you and then we'll go on and we won't talk on this now but you realize that your salvation begins when you believe I don't have a problem but hold that because I'm not gonna express it I didn't say you got saved over the way you're thinking it I'm just saying it begin you gotta have a beginning to everything right he said well you know do you know just hold on them don't run off and thank brother Dale's going haywire but now you tell me the anything you get from God you first got to believe so you're believing is a major thing and the way you believe is a major time we're all of the Apostles or we call them you know disciples did they all finish up and go to Calvin you know to the upper room the receiving of the baptism the Holy Ghost no now cuz we know there was at least 70 walked away from him one time right the point is look everything that you get has got to be based on believing and that's why I've emphasized so much about Abraham because that's been my he is my I don't know what you call it Idol you know looking to or whatever to see and I've always looked even back to the Baptist times and all I've always looked enjoy and enjoyed talking and reading about Abraham because you know what it was just a human being he wasn't no SuperDuper this or that or the other he was just a human being and God spoke to him and said get up and leave this country as I said during the other days ministering owner he never heard sermons telling him about a God that told somebody to get up move or go and do he probably never heard of he nook he probably never heard of know why you know him he was a healer and he probably never had no contact but yet when God spoke to him he got up and left what was that all of Abraham's believing no because each step of his journey if you'll read the life of Abraham you'll see his faith constantly increasing that's what he's always been with me we talk about it you know we'll say well they brahim he uh he believed God and said it was 25 years before the child came and we we said he staggered not at the word of God you know one was believing well that's true but you know what he had a lot of staggering he was a human man that had a lot of problems right but the thing of it was as each time when God would spoke to him the first time he got him left maybe had wavering in it well yet he would hear that voice again that would speak to him again did he'd move on again I'm having waiver back of him but you need to hear that voice again you know what I'm talking about Genesis how he goes from one to the other to the other of things in his life right we said well he never staggered he gave his waffle man all kind of thing you know we see we look at those things and we don't realize that he was just a human being he said brother Dale but you've always preached because I could remember you always preaching Abraham as the father of faith I'm preset in the Baptist Church because I believed it you know why because the Bible says it you know that's why I emphasize a lot of things you know bosom of Abraham Oh before Abraham probably 3,000 years and all of those people out of all of that and now you got a nut you got Adam you got Noah you got all of those but none of them ever turned out to be called the Father faith none of them that was ever put in a position of the man that we called Abraham the man that could believe God he kept on believing him and is he believing he was raised higher he's believing would raise higher now do you understand why did I start back here and get a promise of a child and run around him emphasizes that he staggered not but it just got stronger and stronger believing well wouldn't it be something that you could set down sometimes as I said there the other day why don't you do it sometimes think about your life and where you came from then once you've done it might encourage you because Abraham he's setting up Learning Center well I'll tell you what he it looks like it's pretty bad I'm getting older and older which said you don't want the same one that seems to be talking to me was the one that told me to just get up and come home and said you know what I'd done that and said after doing that did you know what he came to me and he brought me how her you brought me on her see the higher he got no wonder he staggered not no wonder the worse it got the greater he counted it to be true and looking for that son to come for sure he didn't understand sure he wanted this was what it said he had problems but yet when it would end in the end of the day he would come back to the place but then when the Lord promised me somebody make light of him when he come along you know in his name Abram means how father well you know kids but that was his name all right and he comes alone against in each one he's hi father but yet God changes his name to Abraham and it means father of Nations but yet only one son out of all of his children was chosen for the genealogies to follow down and go from one to the other one Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph and come right down to Jesus Christ great thing I was talking with brother long I really enjoyed him there the other night watching it enjoyed his services and humbly you know but I was talking to him about you know that Abraham wouldn't inju there was a Gentile there was no such word as Jew in the time of Abraham and coming over into the Kings through Judah in the different ones but Abraham was called a Hebrew no the Bible calls Abraham a Hebrew why you see what I'm talking about is increasing in his faith as he moves along why was Abraham called a Hebrew he was standing down there one day and he walked across the river and the man reached out and shook his hand said who are you eating it up maybe I am he said oh one from the other side of the river in other words he simply got a word Hebrew out of because oh you come from the other side of the river and that's what the word Hebrew mean one from the other side of the river but you know really the Bible said I brought your father Abraham from the other side of the flood he really did come across the Big River didn't he Hebrew doesn't mean a whole lot don't you come over the big river the flood he said well he wasn't back tyre no but when Abraham received that name or thought about and is he called him a Hebrew he was connected with the great eternal God his experience in growth that greater and greater in his life of serving God you agree until he would finally come and change him and come and do the great things that would happen in the life of Abraham all right can we see that we've come through those things can we follow our lives and watch the journey that's been in our lives as we've come down that we come from here we come to Nara we come to this you remember when you first accepted Jesus Christ you know a young child or something yeah but then it's been a constant growth in Christ ever since all right now if you can follow that then we're going to try to deal with the word believing they were having believed God he told him to get up move he believed him next time he spoke to him he believed him later next time he spoke he believed him greater why can't we accept that in our journey I thought I thought that we believe the Prophet taught a message where Peter had talked about faith furture and all this temperate place and I thought your prophet says we're born again and faith of course they've great revelations and the message others you can't be born again do you come up here with us Holy Spirit and all this you got it upside down and all great things but you know that didn't encourage my believing in you at all then didn't discourage me either because I knew the Prophet said you're born again at faith but you know what is each one of these you are being born again right your faith is increasing you're believing is increasing watch Abraham took this journey me when he read he done this and then brother Branham says let's see who over it who's this Mel Kennedy he said every seed of the faith will take the same journey that Abraham did well we don't have to go over the desert and walk around through the sea that's his carnal as we yet but ever born-again believer is to take a journey upward through as the word unfolds that's the stature of a perfect man and that's just greater believing they said this will be a background now so you need to listen to the point at least at least get the point that it's a constant increasing of your believing because in salvation is proved Abraham because what God done with him in salvation it is not a set down go so far oh I got it all when I believe no then Paul would say after all of the great warriors dire that was it where was it Ephesus well anyhow he comes up and he said have you received the Holy Ghost what since he believed oh but we thought we got it when we believed but he said since you believe we'll get into all of those things as we go along but do you understand what I'm talking about as you're believing increased or has it decreased now to ones who follow the message for a while and fall away you got to admit that there is decreasing you got to admit that I mean they were at one time believers right that's where we're going to get into the salvation no point you know the point that you can come to a place to you could be a believer and then you can lose your position and lose your confession and lose what little bits you have so that's a warning to us to not stop and our believing if you're believing stops if you're if you're believing does not keep constantly increasing and I mean revelation and believe in God and accepting it and being able to to walk in God and believe then there's something wrong with your believing to start with but what about it the disciples said Lord we believe you Nicodemus said we believe you're a man come from God then Jesus looks back in the disciples and he says you're believing all the way down you've been falling with me you've been walking with me and you're increasing in you're believing and says now that increasing in your believing has brought you to a place that you can confess that I am God but then he turns to it and he says do you now believe we've won evidently they're believing was not an anchors steadfast faith it was a mental concept now did brother Randall make that statement he said the biggest portion of our faith is mental faith oh we like to think it's great revelations but that's all for the message that's V Mia's name's the biggest portion of our faith is mental faith now listen to what he says it does there's a pretender he says there's a great faith in all the nature there's a nature given temperance and not like there's a faith and the biggest part of our faith is mental faith by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God by hearing the word brings us to a mental recognition of God do you remember when you first started in your life as a child or early Christian and compare that to where you are today in your faith you remember when you first started in your Christian journey that oh yes you had great faith but then things would fall apart around June you'd fall apart then you stop believing the way you did to start and see you've got trouble when you start letting things get in the way and not believing it in the correct way brother Branham said on the message it is I he said you can't be get warm by planting fire he said neither can you be saved by his a historical God now what's a historical God the God of history what's history by right well God just don't do like he used to do now where would that fit in the Bible how would that fit if God don't do like he used to do where would that fit with Hebrews 13 night now they will not fit no way in an understanding if it's Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever so what do we do then and that's why I hate to hear preachers preach sometimes you know in things and try to say well you know something like this an elder sitting around about way well God don't do today like he did when the Prophet was here now I declare that to be a Allah I defined that upon the basis and you say how would that be of Hebrews 13:8 well where's it at I've already preached those times I've always contended to one time the Prophet said they would be a ministry of jesus christ in the bride of Jesus Christ I mean the Bride of Christ they'd be a ministry just like he had I still believe that's around the world not in one person no more no but it's around the world then I stand with that as I've always stood with it that that's not confession now what's your confession remember whatever you confess is what you are you say he's the same yesterday today and forever only in a certain way now if you're not saying he's totally the same you know what brother Ron said he said a church it says that he says you good away from it now that was the way he said it so if you come into a door or hear of a church it says he's not the same as he's always been and I'll get away from that I don't have time to listen to those things oh but they don't say it that way brother Dale they don't they say he's not to sign him and he doesn't do like he used to do they trying to explain a little word called believe it and if the biggest portion of our faith is mental faith that's mental believing the Bible says faith cometh by what hearing it didn't say faith is hearing the no Bible or the Prophet is one saying faith is hearing your prophet or the Dakar the opposite that faith is not just hearing the word see mental faith is just our own ability to believe but you don't want God takes that I got some quotes Lyn on the desk waiting till later we're brother Branham will speak of people in their confessions and you'll say you don't want says that is your salvation because gonna start somewhere that's the purpose that I've been doing over all this time not just grab the New Testament and we say salvation so you know what most preachers would do they grab the New Testament they grab this and they grab that and they'd have you do it and running the aisles for listening to the things but if we can't go back in the Old Testament to see what their salvation was how are you gonna know what yours is if it's contrary something's wrong those people back there had a mental conception of the Word of God they could not have a Holy Ghost field experience of salvation you agree I mean no not to check errors they're gonna know whatever you just forget it because I don't depend on that that's your business if you don't believe it didn't forget it but listen you show me a word ain't right you show me were that believing that God brought eternal life to any of them no and because it he spent three-and-a-half years with her disciples they still never received the true faith until the day of Pentecost you know whatever one of those disciples we'll get back to it and talk about you know what they started their journey it wasn't no supernatural great thing it was just people receiving God's Word I always thought about that I thought well that you know that's really odd that the Lord Jesus he was just walking down through there one day and he he looks over and he said Peter throw down your net this throw your net down you living and everything tell your wife goodbye and said come follow me well see we could old Baptists you know what we done with him we had Peter born in him gone we had him accepting Jesus Christ right there and I was his salvation well now he died yet how can you help celebration okay but he did do it isn't it odd that Abraham left his family you know I mean who's supposed to left his had in there I mean is he supposed to live lot he left all of that ended hard when Jesus come he expected those disciples just lay down everything just not that they had heard this or seen that or some miracle he's just come on he never went down and done a miracle and then turns at Peter now done the miracle now you know I must be something so come on Peter had enough believing he said and you remember later on when they got to the place working we go we can't go nowheres else you are alone how the words of eternal life what can we do that's why they what no 10,000 people accepted Jesus cried he picked out twelve and one of them was Judah you know we throw off him him a lot but the old boy fathered a long time you know what he had for the ministry he healed the sick and cast out Devils you know all that through Judas get part of the ministry he was a believer and his believe it was great but then one day he stopped believing he went as far as he could go it's hard to stay away from preaching when I'll be back on Sunday but you'll get a repeat so don't worried about it I'm just concerned with one thing try to get you to think as God accepted your believing then we talk about great faith and great things because you know you can't have faith without the Holy Ghost giving it to you now remember that we have studied these things before that the little woman at the whale the Prophet said had what he said she had faith for the time which meant what she believed it she got what she was asking for is all she needed at that time but it wasn't enough to birth her the Lord Jesus stood one day just prior to his death and said and breathed on a disciples and said receive you the Holy Ghost but we got over Abdus had him born again that time what did you have but then we heard the Prophet explain it didn't it he said is only a promise he said they didn't get the new birth that day it was only a promise thank God that we've been able to how the truth in that way we don't have to stumble along and want this is the one that sickens me but it tickles me anyway have you ever said in meetings especially the ministers and they'll say of what is your input you know what is your input now somebody define input it would probably be your thoughts or your ways or whatever you do and what is your thoughts what is your understanding now didn't know we had an input I thought we had a revelation of Jesus Christ I thought we didn't have any thoughts of her own I thought we had Jesus Christ to come and live in us to do his own thinking throughout but yet simply believing salvation of the Old Testament was based upon whether the people could believe that God had spoken to them right then we can see that they would move up higher into a substance as we said about the woman a substance for the time then we can preach Sampson as a part happening to him and his mental believing and all of the things that he had and all at once it begins to wall up into the man until it went beyond mentally believing it went into a substance believing it went into a fact that he knew God was with him we see David and we see him outturn why is he not afraid of the line the buyer and the job because it went from mental believing right Dipsy brothers joined him back went from a mental believing listen to a substance enough for that time no but you know what I love about it I live this about the Word of God you know that David killed Goliath what he didn't kill nobody else you know what I mean right in that battle he frog went over under tree said I only said okay boys y'all take care of them you know what they did then the children of Israel rose up under David and went out and slaughtered the kings and the thing because he sparked their faith from a mental believing oh yeah they had a mental even remember his brothers you remember David's brothers when David went out there to see him you know what to say it they said David have you come out here to see the battle and every one of them was singing who's going to fight who's go to fight but yet oh they had a great believing they were believers enough to line up for the army but they wouldn't believe in enough to go face that giant but David had a substance for the time that developed into his life until he was not ascared and what did he say he said to God that killed a bar the god that killed a line now let's let's put one more in there the God that walked out there one day and anointed me to be king and I ain't got there yet right come on Samuel anointed him to be King David knew they didn't matter what was going on with Goliath or anybody he knew he wasn't gonna die until he reached the throne he might have died and two minutes after it when he was going to sit on that throne because that prophet told him you see he had a faith for the time that your prophet will call it substance faith maybe not the word substance faith at that point putting the two words together cuz you won't find it substance faith you'll just finally pure faith or something you say well how do you know god I just got through running so since I come here today there's only about three of them you know but listen are you following me David started out believe in God he had been taught about God in the things right and he had a believe he would he didn't run out and kill Goliath until he killed the bar and the line right if they kept increasing until it become a faith for the time there would be a substance to make him be what he needed there's a lot of difference between mental faith and substance faith right Peter one day walked on water because Jesus told him to come on Jesus put the substance under and right then he come walking but when he realized what was going on he got the following and he lost the Prophet said his substance he said he still had his faith now you want that quote he still had his believing Lord saved me but his substance that went down underneath a lot of difference between mental concept and a substance I'm trying to get you to swatch things as it grows greater and greater those disciples those people back tire before Jesus Christ died to give his life to come and live into them did not have what would be known as a great substance faith they proved it when they couldn't cast that could heal if they could do that Carter told the one the little kid come along with epileptic child what did he say what did Jesus say he said over you of little faith he said in other words what you don't think about is if you could pray for one guy where I want to go they'd have a headache and he got healed and said why is this giving you trouble what are you driving at I'm driving at one thing heavily and hard because it ties the Old Testament with the new oh God wants I don't never quoting it there the other night but around said all God wants is one man didn't get in his hands he said he can't I don't turn the world upside down that one person and he did through the prophets ministry right you know but you know what that was an example that wasn't an only child oh that's what you think you think oh but that was an only child it's only gonna happen with him mm-hmm I made my statement while ago and I contend for it always how the Ministry of Jesus Christ around the world is exactly the Ministry of Jesus Christ and that was the ministry around the head was the Ministry of Jesus Christ you put it all back together and you got Jesus Christ standing on this earth right now because if you don't then you're not having he bruised 13:8 is to being true where are you listening the disciples said Lord we believe this but he said do you now believe in other words have you increased and your believing in your thinking to place it you can believe greater things you see if we don't start out with a mental fight we're not going to have a spiritual revelation now this is what I've always said I know they have always been throwing rocks at me about we don't need these deep things we just need to be simple well I thought the message was simple but I ain't gonna do it with a point of I'm making because you say well we need these deep well what's wrong with eating what was brought to us you know it might trigger something within us to eat the message it might bring us to a place that we can believe I said about David David's believing was anchored in the line the buyer the point that he was not King yet then he said who's afraid of Goliath but it's brothers they were great believers because they were standing out there with their swords more they was already and David comes up and they're all shaking and you know life in he's know what's going on they said have you come out to see the battle there was no battle to see and someone stepped out who had his mental faith had become a spiritual revelation you know that's all God wants us to do why is repetitive things of a wonderful outfit you know what I mean studying over and over in things he should bring us to a at least a mental concept now quote brother branham he said if I can't do these things what'd he say he said don't let me stand in the way of somebody that can well he was an example we'll use these leaders and come back to it like we did the other day know that Adam was an example example son that's what God wanted right what Adam was is what God wanted you know why he created him he made him that's what he made him he's making nothing else he made him that huh Jesus but Adam lost Jesus redeemed didn't it odd that here stands Jesus on earth I stood Adam back tire body spirit not eternal soul eternal when Jesus came what was standing on the earth a man that his body was not eternal but his soul and spirit was but he was called the what Jesus was called the second Adam is that Scripture the second out of what was it how is that scripture first hate men Adam was made a living soul is it when it no is it a second man Adam was made a living spirit or will quickening experience quickens for your honor he it moved into a greater realm of what God wanted but it started with him being and what was Jesus according to revelation 3:14 what was he which is the message to this age he was the beginning of the creation of God he was what God wants you and I to be now well but we can't do that see now the arsy unbelief now we're gonna hit this for a minute then we'll quit the anytime when something is presented to you and you back off and say but we can't do that that unbelief has stopped your believing oh no did put you back in the world no I didn't tell you only by it just stops you believing all right are you listening so you say well here's this and hear that but we can't do that you've automatically become an unbeliever now I know this is gonna be hard cuz it's three weeks I've been trying to study how to find the words to say it so get upset women do what you want to I'm gonna say it anyway you see our trouble is we're believers yeah yeah we're believers we've read this message we studied it we can tell you all the things run around and say it we can quote him about everything we can say everything but then all you got to do is say one thing and say well then Hebrews 13:8 declares him to be the same tonight that he was when the Prophet was here now are you following me then you tell me somewhere brother Dell we can't do these thing and I'm gonna tell you up front now so don't do it please now cause you can't get you feeling hurt coming you tell me that we're brother Dale we can't do these things I'm gonna tell you you're an unbeliever you won't tell you that he that believeth not is condemned already because you condemned your own self now God has never wounded and has never done and will never do again what was done in the prophets ministry by one man that's of it I have never looked for another prophet to come another person to come or anything like that but I've always taught what the Prophet said the Ministry of Jesus Christ would be in the world around the world in the Bride of Christ see that makes him Hebrews 13:8 but we don't see these gifts of this out of the we're just not looking around but you know what somebody tell you that so-and-so happened do you believe it why couldn't we at least believe it's possible okay let's go with that why couldn't we at least believe it's possible but we you know somebody tell you what George don't happen there's a lot of people been prayed for you know you know they didn't get healed we don't know about them the only quote was right around them about it listen Church if we doubt in any way the fact that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever may I quote your prophet he said if your church don't believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever in every way now let's don't play around he said get away from it so you see why that I've got to believe if I'm going to be a pastor I've got to believe that there's no difference in the ministry Jesus Christ when he was walking the shores of Galilee then tonight I've got to believe that there's no difference in the ministry of brother Branham then there is of Jesus Christ tonight because if not then you'd have to get away from every Church yeah but that's just say SOB's they're like a brother told me he used to scream and holler at us he says if you got the Holy Ghost to end up show me a signs miracles and wonders I never got up because I didn't want no problem but I asked him to come to my house and we sat down and talked and I said you've kept on making that statement that if we got the ministry of Jesus Christ you know I mean we've got the Holy Ghost and I said here is the quote from the Prophet showing you all of these people that had to hold it go no well he said and you some of you remember the statement he said we don't have perfect love like they did beyond the curtain time I said well brother branham's saw a lot of people beyond the curtain time it had perfect love well that could be any this way that he see he was quick I said but and what the lady he met there was 90 years old how about his wife that was there how about he's made the statement that his first girlfriend was there but you didn't produce enough of them one go you need if his wife was there she had perfect love all born to get believers how perfect love but are you getting what I'm saying if we don't believe tonight that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we might as well go home and forget it the brother kept on quoting that until I told him one day I said brother I said now you're gonna get upset with me I said I'm gonna tell you you keep on saying if you got the Holy Ghost show me a signs miracles and wonders cuz I'm gonna tell you one time that was that same devil that was standing out there and Jesus hanging on the cross and said if you be God come down did you call him a devil no no I got more sense than that cuz he ain't the devil he wasn't a devil I said what said that through you is the same devil that said come down off the cross and I'll believe you what about believing how great is our believing do we believe well I believe everything the Prophet said hmm praise the Lord I believe everything he said well praise the Lord at least we got as I started to say well ago people always said I was so intellectual in preaching these things of the seals and if I only the one thing about it at least we've got to seed so I can't make it live anyway and never have tried so at least we got to see so what about these churches we don't believe do know that no we don't want to get confused we don't want to do that Daniel 70 weeks and them seals that's too deep that was for the Prophet okay if it was okay if it was for him only then you got a problem I can quote you from name-brand preachers one especially that said the third pool was only for brother Branham and the Lord Jesus Christ some of you probably heard that from him then he made a statement I don't have to argue with him that's what he said he said it was only for the Lord Jesus then brother Branham now may I read not with me but may I quote it and if you want even have it if you say that brother Branham was the only one and the Lord Jesus was the only one what about when brought around was said the third pool it's far the bride and the church is that the statement and to the totally lost now he said well brother Dale did that guy hinder your faith no he encouraged me because I believe the ministry Jesus Christ is here in the bride across around the world doing what he said he would do but you see the brother making his statement see he made this big step I believe it only for brother Branham and the Lord Jesus will brother Branham said it was it's it's it's hard it straightens him out for brother Branham to say that the third pool is for the bride that straightens out the doctrine of the man who taught that right but what about wrote around him saying the third pool was far the church I didn't make the statement and he said it was true that totally lost so you think I'm gonna quote that brother as to believing it like that no I don't believe it that way they something about my believing won't let me believe that you know why come I believe in is anchored in what the Prophet said about it what he told me it was far is what it is not what they say or this sailor that's it but you know everything now I'm going to bring it to a closed to narrow down the point and then we'll drop right back Sunday the Lord with it everything we get from God must start at a mental faith yeah but I got just super different revelation I got it started from a mental faith let me then at least mentally say the things the Bible has said the prophet has said let me at least say it mentally then I can at least say by believing can increase because I'm confessing that he's here I love that quote where the Prophet said I'm not saying he's coming he said I'm saying he's here well not when we're gonna say that we're gonna say he's here yeah but he ain't I didn't say he'd finished up everything I'd say nothing about it I didn't say it was all over well no I said he said it was here well then they say he's here because if I say he's here he come on the scene do something if I don't say he's here he can't do anything cuz he you're not gonna believe this statement but God can't work outside of your faith you sell murderers L know God can't work outside of somebody that will say it now God can do anything he wants to brother there he can but he won't he can save everybody in the world today right but he won't one because he can't override their free moral agency and he cannot get them to believe now I'm finishing by the statement of this will pick it back up he's everybody that says Jesus is the Christ are they saved they could have a point and a start because everybody's going to start time everybody's going out to start saying Jesus is the Christ and then not stop believing anything thereafter but everybody see your salvation I don't care who you are and how fancy anything is we believe the Prophet your salvation begins when you believe I didn't say in I didn't say it was all of it or nothing about it I said it begins when you believe now you show me in the Bible that's not right you show me and run rounds message they touch statements not right then at least we ought to be able to say it as a mental statement of salvation and then keep on saying it until it becomes a reality about it come on musicians how about it where are you at compared to where you was five years ago ten years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago as your face stopped because remember we'll get to this if your confession stops your faith stops don't care what you call it it stops salvation is of the Lord everybody is based on one thing can you believe every person has ever been saved he's got to do one thing and that's believe you got a starting point that's how I believe at least we could say as their disciples in Lord help my unbelief in little word don't let me stop believing let me continue on so I told the Baptist's before back way before you know in that I never did agree with them did you got everything when you believed and I remember that a Baptist preacher that come in talking to me after I left I said what happened he said what do you mean I see you told us we was all saved when we believed I said don't play with me now and run back and say I didn't do I said tell the truth about it but he you told everybody when they believed that they're saved he said yes we did I said but what happened what happened somebody stopped believing somewhere would you say cause you believe you started in the right direction because you can't be saved without believing let's just don't cut herself I'm gonna written down with run around said people cut herself short he said very few never believe all the way to receiving the Holy Spirit of God but they start well we got less time why don't you just start [Music] lúcia start somewhere once he did say lord i love you lord I'm accepting you is my Savior [Music] do you know what our trouble is the unbelief comes in the brother day and I've already got up and said I say if I couldn't say again I'd say I'll beat the nine oh it's the biggest lie the devil has ever told the biggest live never been told this we try to tell you [Music] - stop confessions you know my statement I'd rather spend all of my life praising God and thanking God and asking him to save me can get down that day they find out I shaved the whole time then to get dark found out I wouldn't say let me just keep saying so that's what we're doing we're being born again we're being saved in the end the night rapture takes place there salvation will be complete you
