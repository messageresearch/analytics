[0:16] to start on the fifth seal now we want
[0:19] I've already got some things written
[0:20] down here but let's just back around
[0:21] just for a minute oh I want you to um
[0:25] remember brother Claude he has prostate
[0:27] cancer but it's only stage one they're
[0:30] not going to check him for another year
[0:32] so he's not worried about it but just
[0:35] keep him in your prayer because uh when
[0:37] you say that word you know kind of
[0:39] worries you a little bit humanly it
[0:41] worries you a little bit so but he had
[0:43] stage one no PSA High nothing they found
[0:46] it by doing an MRI on his on his
[0:50] uh hip because his hip was hurting
[0:54] so they find he was in it was inlarged
[0:57] so they did some biopsies and two of the
[1:00] came back with cancer cells so but
[1:02] they're like I said they're not worried
[1:03] about it right now must not be for
[1:06] another year you know so just keep them
[1:08] in your prayer though uh now we're going
[1:11] to start the fifth seal but now the
[1:12] fourth seal I want you to remember now
[1:14] the fourth
[1:15] seal
[1:17] is the rapture seal right the Rapture
[1:20] takes place on the four seal so we've
[1:22] got I want you to pay attention to
[1:24] what's Happening Here 1 2 3 and four
[1:28] happens where
[1:30] when the angel told John said come and
[1:32] see he had to be brought
[1:34] somewhere right right come and see John
[1:38] John come and see look over here it says
[1:40] in number four and when he had opened
[1:42] the fourth seal I heard the voice of the
[1:43] fourth be say come and
[1:46] see when he had opened the third seal I
[1:48] heard the Beast say come and
[1:50] see so what John is going he is going
[1:54] where
[1:55] that angel is telling him or that combat
[1:58] Beast is telling him to go all right
[2:00] he's being led by the Holy Ghost is that
[2:03] all right he's being led by the Holy
[2:04] Ghost and being led by the Holy Ghost
[2:07] John has to go see he says come and see
[2:09] so John must have had to step into
[2:11] something now but
[2:13] remember when we come to the fifth seal
[2:15] now when he says when he opened the fif
[2:16] seal I
[2:18] saw there was no combat Beast to say
[2:21] come and see there was no nothing what
[2:23] it
[2:24] happened all four of the combat Beast
[2:28] are in this dimension
[2:31] this Dimension this is where the Holy
[2:33] Ghost is at now is in this Dimension
[2:35] where we are now this is where the lonox
[2:37] man and Eagle is working is in this
[2:40] Dimension sure we know it's another
[2:43] dimensional um supernatural being cuz he
[2:46] can be in you me and somebody in Africa
[2:48] at the same time so we know he's we know
[2:51] he's traveling through
[2:53] Dimensions faster than we can blink an
[2:56] eye
[2:57] but these to get the to to get the Gest
[3:00] of these seals you got to see that God
[3:02] come down into this
[3:04] Dimension to get a group of people okay
[3:09] now and he's took them all in the
[3:10] Rapture
[3:12] right right here took them all in the
[3:14] Rapture the the L the justification
[3:17] sanation baptism the Holy Ghost and the
[3:19] word being made known even to John John
[3:23] it does not have it's not that John
[3:25] doesn't have need of that combat Beast
[3:28] or need of someone to lead him in he's
[3:31] come to a position to where God can
[3:33] speak straight to him you understand
[3:35] what I'm
[3:36] saying he's using he's using these
[3:39] combat beasts come and see John come
[3:41] here I want to show you something step
[3:42] into this John must be in now another
[3:45] dimension and he's staying there okay
[3:49] because look these souls are not in this
[3:51] Dimension right at all right they're in
[3:54] another dimension okay they're in a
[3:57] dimension apart from us so John Say by
[4:00] his Revelation there's no combat Beast
[4:02] to lead John anymore John has become the
[4:06] Holy
[4:08] Ghost wait with me and
[4:10] you right
[4:13] amen he's not a third person of the
[4:16] Trinity he is the person of Jesus Christ
[4:19] what that's your new birth personally to
[4:21] you all right it's you and God in there
[4:25] as persons not not separate I thought we
[4:28] were supposed to
[4:30] Vulcan be so vulcanized that you can't
[4:32] tell the difference between the Holy
[4:33] Ghost and you I thought that's what we
[4:36] were supposed to come to adoption and
[4:37] all those great things that we're coming
[4:38] through well that's what like we're
[4:40] talking about last night you've got to
[4:41] come through adoption before you can
[4:43] understand the fullness of the seal
[4:45] brother B had to come to the fullness of
[4:46] adoption before you can understand the
[4:47] SE the revelation of the seals all right
[4:50] sure you can get bits and
[4:52] pieces but to get that full opening of
[4:55] the word of God you must come to a place
[4:57] to where God can say right here with
[5:00] John you got to listen to what John say
[5:03] I saw look how personal it is now I saw
[5:07] and all the other ones it says John come
[5:09] and see another not another person but
[5:12] someone else is grabbing John and saying
[5:15] come here I want to show you
[5:16] something now in the fifth seal
[5:19] Everything Changes that's why the
[5:21] prophet of God knew that the Rapture
[5:22] took place on the fourth seal the bride
[5:24] goes up because this is not to the
[5:27] bride in this dimension
[5:31] right cuz we're gone right we're not in
[5:35] this
[5:36] Dimension John is physically not in this
[5:39] Dimension okay sure he's waiting and all
[5:42] you understand what I'm saying but he's
[5:43] not he's not in this Dimension we're in
[5:46] now he has stepped into another
[5:49] dimension and he did it the God took him
[5:53] into that Dimension because of remember
[5:55] he was commissioned to write but I
[5:57] believe John there was some things he
[5:58] did see I saw so he saw with his eyes so
[6:03] he goes to another
[6:05] dimension where there is a group of one
[6:08] group of
[6:09] people we talking about dimensions a
[6:11] little bit last night and it's really
[6:14] easy but it's really
[6:15] hard M all right cuz it is it's really
[6:20] easy you got you got seven
[6:24] dimensions we know there's only one
[6:27] person in this one
[6:30] Jesus Christ alone with a glorified
[6:33] body
[6:35] done this Dimension this is what God
[6:38] alone that's what brother Brown you know
[6:40] brother rown said can I see Jesus he
[6:41] said no he's a little
[6:43] higher why he's standing there with a
[6:45] glorified body there's no one got a
[6:46] glorified body except Jesus at this
[6:48] moment what about anoch you answer that
[6:51] I'm just telling you the Bible says only
[6:53] one person is reach
[6:54] immortality cuz remember when brother
[6:56] Brown went to that sixth Dimension sure
[6:58] they were Immortal Souls
[7:00] but they weren't Immortal Souls in
[7:03] flesh all right they got to come back
[7:05] here to get their flesh body so that six
[7:07] Dimension would be what only bride now
[7:10] you say only that excludes but just
[7:12] let's just say
[7:14] bride this is what you and I live in
[7:16] this is right
[7:20] now we know what four is four is Radio
[7:24] TV demons microwaves demons oh you know
[7:28] they all travel in the fourth Dimension
[7:32] right but it's really not a place it's
[7:34] just out
[7:37] there so The Fifth Dimension the prophet
[7:39] of God said was the
[7:43] Sinners so you got to put them in one of
[7:45] them seven okay all right and we'll get
[7:48] into this I'm working gradually because
[7:51] I'm going to tell you
[7:52] something I don't want to do like one
[7:54] brother last year used circumstantial
[7:58] evidence Pro something I want to have
[8:00] some evidence backing me up but you got
[8:02] to remember brother BR didn't speak too
[8:04] much about what was inside these
[8:05] Dimensions except for what he saw when
[8:07] he went there because there is truth to
[8:11] one
[8:13] thing these people right here white
[8:16] robes were given so they they did not
[8:18] have white robes when they died okay so
[8:21] then they didn't have the Holy Ghost
[8:23] when they died they could not go in this
[8:26] Dimension they could not go in this
[8:28] dimension they definitely are not in
[8:31] this one and they're not in that one so
[8:34] there's got to be a piece in here
[8:36] somewhere what we've been talking about
[8:39] overlap an
[8:41] overlap there's an overlap somewhere
[8:43] where these people are
[8:46] preserved but they can't you got that's
[8:49] why you got to do like brother Dell
[8:50] always say you got to you got to say
[8:52] okay do it by process of elimination
[8:54] they can't be in that one they can't be
[8:57] in that one and they're definitely not
[8:59] radio waves are
[9:02] demons okay so they got to be somewhere
[9:05] around that Fifth
[9:12] Dimension and they're a special group of
[9:15] people we'll talk about that in just a
[9:17] second so let's just look at all
[9:19] these no combat beef all right let's
[9:23] read the seal and when he had opened the
[9:25] fifth seal I saw under the
[9:26] altar The Souls of that now remember
[9:29] brother BR so this see this would be the
[9:32] now what is on the altar it's blood
[9:35] sacrifice amen that everybody knows that
[9:38] under that altar is a blood
[9:41] sacrifice all right covers I I thought
[9:45] brother said it covered everybody right
[9:47] now we're all covered under the blood
[9:48] all right but when you pass away you go
[9:53] somewhere under here I'm just putting
[9:56] people right Christ is
[10:00] here and then even brother randam in the
[10:02] sixth Dimension which was the bride he
[10:05] said that was Souls under the or the
[10:07] angel told him that was so under the
[10:09] altar right right so you got the
[10:13] altar then this is what I see that you
[10:16] got your sixth Dimension real close to
[10:18] that cuz these people don't need
[10:20] Redemption anymore they're already
[10:22] passed from Death unto life they're
[10:23] already in Eternal bodies but these
[10:27] people were not okay when they died they
[10:31] didn't have eternal life in their soul
[10:33] the only people that go in that sixth
[10:34] Dimension is people that die with
[10:36] eternal life in their soul because
[10:37] brother Ram asked that angel said what
[10:39] is this he said this is perfect
[10:43] love perfect love can't be in The Fifth
[10:47] Dimension it can only be in the sixth
[10:49] Dimension all right so these are souls
[10:51] Under The
[10:53] Altar and they have
[10:56] a I'm sorry but this is the only way I
[10:58] can say it they have an
[11:02] attitude cuz these right here under the
[11:05] Sixth Dimension are not sitting there
[11:06] crying how long how long to avenge our
[11:09] blood that's not their
[11:11] attitude that's not their attitude
[11:14] there's no avengeance in that sixth
[11:15] Dimension they didn't walk up brother
[11:17] around and say ah bless God I wish I
[11:19] heard him get back cuz I so I can you
[11:21] know do away with the guy that killed me
[11:25] no but these do because they're what
[11:27] they're all Jewish right okay but white
[11:31] robes were given to them okay now
[11:36] watch I so Al to The Souls of them that
[11:39] were slain for the word of God and for
[11:42] the testimony which they held now listen
[11:45] they did not have the testimony of Jesus
[11:48] Christ no
[11:50] remember all
[11:53] Jews 99.9% of the Jews don't believe
[11:56] Jesus was was the Savior almighty God
[11:58] Messi whatever you want to say
[12:01] okay so you're looking at a group of
[12:03] people that had a testimony if you read
[12:06] your fifth seal which I want you to do
[12:07] read that fifth seal the testimony they
[12:10] held was they're
[12:13] Jews we're God's chosen people we're
[12:15] Jews we're God's chosen people rejected
[12:18] the Messiah but we're God's chosen
[12:21] people and brother brand said that is
[12:23] their testimony which they H there is no
[12:25] testimony see these right here in the
[12:27] sixth Dimension they have the testimony
[12:29] of Jesus Christ cuz Jesus Christ is the
[12:31] one to put them in that Dimension the
[12:33] blood of Jesus Christ put them in that
[12:35] sixth Dimension them accepting the blood
[12:37] and it cleansing them on this side on
[12:39] this side in the three dimensions over
[12:41] here put them in the sixth Dimension a
[12:44] place brother B said you don't even want
[12:46] to come back to this one all right it
[12:48] was so glorious and so wonderful all
[12:51] right now look but he said this group of
[12:54] people they CED with a loud voice saying
[12:56] how long oh Lord holy and true does
[12:59] shall not judge and avenge our blood on
[13:03] them that dwell on the
[13:04] earth brother said that's not the bride
[13:07] the bride doesn't yell for judgment the
[13:10] bride yells for Mercy right so you've
[13:12] got a group of people that's under the
[13:15] altar right
[13:19] here fifth SE of
[13:22] Jew they're still under the blood
[13:25] sacrifice the blood altar but they're
[13:27] not like that the bride the sixth
[13:30] Dimension
[13:33] people
[13:34] no cuz
[13:36] what and white robes were given unto
[13:40] every one of them and it was said unto
[13:44] them that they should rest yet for a
[13:46] little
[13:47] season until their fellow servants let's
[13:50] go back up here let's go back to 1 2 and
[13:52] three dimension
[14:00] right anybody got
[14:02] that they should rest for a little see
[14:05] until their fellow servants now what is
[14:07] their F servants and Brethren that has
[14:09] to be
[14:11] Jews okay
[14:14] yeah right that should be killed as they
[14:18] were should be
[14:21] fulfilled got that until their fellow
[14:24] servant so they're going to be killed so
[14:26] I got they got to be killed
[14:27] somewhere and
[14:29] put in here now watch you got to also
[14:34] remember too brother random one
[14:37] place he talks about Ian and Hitler what
[14:42] you know they killed 6.8 million Jews
[14:45] see those Jews were killed because they
[14:47] were Jews right right that's right they
[14:50] didn't have a testimony of Jesus Christ
[14:51] they were killed because of Jews they're
[14:53] in that fifth seal you I believe because
[14:55] that's what the prophet of God said he
[14:56] said killed under Amman and Hitler but
[14:59] you can still go all the way back far as
[15:01] you want to cuz the Jewish Community
[15:03] remember after after
[15:07] ad30 they still believe the Messiah was
[15:09] coming right they believed it so much so
[15:12] in ad70 40 years later kidus comes in
[15:15] and destroys them Slaughters them
[15:17] because they thought God was still in
[15:19] the temple so they run back into the
[15:21] city of
[15:24] Jerusalem Titus surrounded them and they
[15:26] had to eat their own children bark off
[15:28] the tree because they rejected the
[15:30] Messiah but they were
[15:32] Jews
[15:33] right right they're all Jews and then
[15:36] now the Jews in 8070 they were
[15:40] dispersed uh throughout all the all the
[15:42] world you can't tell which ones Judah
[15:45] and Ephraim and Manasseh you can't tell
[15:48] the tribes but God knows where they at
[15:51] the great scientist God Almighty that
[15:52] has all the DNA of the world of all the
[15:55] people knows exactly where each one of
[15:57] these tribes are cuz he's getting ready
[15:59] to
[16:00] call after we leave here see after we
[16:04] leave here MH see this this couldn't
[16:07] happen until we left that's
[16:09] right God's not dealing with two people
[16:11] at the same time he deals with the
[16:13] Gentiles amen sure people look there's
[16:15] Jews in here there's Jews that receive
[16:18] the Holy Ghost and being the
[16:20] bride
[16:22] okay but remember the the ones that give
[16:25] their life for their testimony
[16:29] that they held which we are Jews we are
[16:31] God's people cuz look they were slain
[16:34] for the word of God they believe in the
[16:35] word of God the Torah the the old they
[16:39] believe in
[16:40] that can explain it more than you and I
[16:43] can but they don't have the Holy Ghost
[16:45] in their soul because God blinded their
[16:49] eyes god what the prophet God said God
[16:53] blinded their eyes so that you and I
[16:55] could come in amen and we'll read it
[16:59] probably or I won't be here next Sunday
[17:00] but the next Sunday Ryan's doing next
[17:02] Sunday um we'll look at where in in
[17:06] Ezekiel and Jeremiah they said where did
[17:09] you get those scars he says in the house
[17:10] of my friend and they say oh we're in
[17:12] bad shape we're in bad shape we we have
[17:14] rejected the Messiah he said no don't
[17:16] worry he said it was done not for you it
[17:19] was done in other words for the Gentile
[17:21] paraphrase it was done to bring a people
[17:23] in look I you take that Daniel 70 weeks
[17:27] and you
[17:30] you got church ages here right you got
[17:32] what happened here which is 69 weeks and
[17:34] then you got one week left after the
[17:35] Rapture right right right and that's all
[17:38] Jewish that's right now if they would
[17:40] have accepted the Messiah right
[17:49] here that's what would have
[17:52] happened they would have went right on
[17:54] into that 70th week there would have
[17:55] been no Gentiles saved and they would
[17:57] have went right on cuz look that
[17:59] Millennium is to who them that's right
[18:02] brother Brown said what was injected
[18:04] that Wild Olive Branch the Bible says
[18:06] was what the the Gentiles were
[18:10] grafted in right there's your grafting
[18:14] it was grafted into that
[18:16] tree and the reason we were grafted in
[18:19] cuz right here God what he blinded the
[18:22] eyes of the Jews but he's given them one
[18:24] more week which is 3 and 1/2 years of
[18:27] ministry plus 3 and 1/2 years to put us
[18:29] in the Millennium we've already been
[18:30] through that but they get that last
[18:32] Ministry of Jesus Christ right here to
[18:35] redeem them and take them out of here
[18:37] now that's not talking about this group
[18:39] though that's right different group
[18:41] that's right cuz remember the 144,000
[18:43] they receive eternal life here that's
[18:45] right that's right so that's another
[18:46] group you got to section all that
[18:49] off but this fifth seal Jew are the Jews
[18:52] that are that have died under
[18:55] persecution of ikan Hitler and even back
[18:57] whenever uh you may even consider the
[19:01] excuse me the ones that uh Titus but I
[19:04] have a problem with that is because they
[19:06] turned they turned God down while he was
[19:08] on Earth so but you know what I leave
[19:12] that up to God this group right here the
[19:14] prophet of God said was all the
[19:15] persecuted Jews okay so this is a
[19:18] certain group of people yes this is not
[19:22] Nations this is not
[19:24] Gentiles this is not anybody but Jewish
[19:28] so it's all Jewish that's why you got
[19:30] you Daniel 70 weeks 69 weeks they
[19:33] rejected the
[19:35] Messiah and then there's 3 and a half
[19:37] years left of ministry 1260 days
[19:39] Ministry of two prophets to bring in not
[19:42] a whole not a whole not all jewelry not
[19:45] all not jewelry jewelry jewelry jewry to
[19:50] bring all to not bring all jewelry no
[19:52] when that you know who's going to
[19:54] persecute this
[19:56] 144,000 their own brethren
[19:59] the Jews they're going to persecute them
[20:03] you know why because the 144,000 are
[20:05] going to look at all the all the jewelry
[20:10] look at all the people in Israel
[20:12] remember CU they'll establish Temple
[20:14] worship when they got that when that
[20:16] contract is signed right here with the
[20:19] pop the beast that's a 7-year contract
[20:23] and the Bible says in the middle of that
[20:25] contract he'll break it well for this 3
[20:27] and 1/2 years they're going to go back
[20:28] to Temple
[20:30] worship Rome's going to give them all
[20:32] their stuff back cuz Tyler stole them
[20:34] all when he took them out he took he he
[20:36] took the temple apart took the Manara
[20:39] holy of holies he took they took
[20:40] everything out well they're going to
[20:42] give it back Rome's going to say hey
[20:44] I'll sign this treaty because you know
[20:46] what we know one thing for
[20:49] sure when Satan makes a treaty or or a
[20:53] contract it's usually very one-sided on
[20:56] his side okay so that's what the RO
[20:59] Romans going to say look we want this if
[21:01] you want this you got to give me this so
[21:04] that's what's going to happen then what
[21:05] he's going to do
[21:07] is God's going to call out 144,000
[21:10] during this time but what about them old
[21:12] staunched Jews they said hey guys we got
[21:15] this thing back to where we're supposed
[21:16] to have it we waited for 2,000 years
[21:19] we're back to Temple worship and Moses
[21:21] and Elijah the spirit of Moses and
[21:23] Elijah walks into the temple and says
[21:25] your God's not
[21:27] here God's not anywhere around this
[21:29] place they're going to hate them people
[21:32] and then 144,000 is just like me and you
[21:35] in the denominations we were in or the
[21:38] mess that we were in okay come out of
[21:40] her my people there was a message that
[21:43] called us out right right right and why
[21:46] do we now to the denomination of the
[21:47] world we're quacks CS they don't
[21:49] understand us why because and you know
[21:52] the Baptist says we're right Methodist
[21:54] says we're right Pentecostal said we're
[21:56] right and you're wrong and then we're
[21:59] standing on this s side saying no we
[22:01] have the right message that's what the
[22:03] Jews are going to say so who so who's
[22:05] going to persecute us the people closest
[22:07] to us always persecute you all right so
[22:10] that's what's going to happen here is is
[22:12] they're going to be persecuted by a
[22:13] group of people right in their own City
[22:16] cuz
[22:17] listen like we covered in the Daniel 70
[22:20] weeks at this time right here the world
[22:24] the Gentile world is going to be in
[22:26] turmoil right they ain't going to care
[22:29] about two prophets because them two
[22:30] prophets are not to them now they will
[22:32] get the residual effect from it
[22:34] earthquakes tornadoes they'll get the
[22:37] residual effect from it the whole world
[22:39] will but they're not going to they're
[22:41] not going to send the CIA or the FBI
[22:43] over there if there is anyone left by
[22:45] them they're not going to send the CIA
[22:47] or the FBI to kill them because the
[22:48] Bible says they're killed by their own
[22:50] people that's right okay they'll be
[22:52] killed in the streets of Jerusalem so
[22:54] who's going to kill them somebody from
[22:56] maybe the Messi or something is going to
[22:58] kill him so you understand so it's not
[23:00] the whole world worrying about him it's
[23:02] just the
[23:03] Jews cuz look God never said he would
[23:06] never forget Israel and that's the same
[23:08] thing right here the testimony they held
[23:09] is we're Israelites we are God's chosen
[23:14] people and God said okay I had to Blind
[23:17] your
[23:18] eyes what to take out a bride and
[23:22] because I'm doing
[23:24] that I'm going to step in and I'm going
[23:26] to do something that I'm not going to to
[23:28] any other
[23:30] group I'm going to give you white robes
[23:34] after you're gone after you're dead I'm
[23:37] my judgment is going to be passed
[23:40] actually it was passed before the
[23:41] foundation of the world but my judgment
[23:43] is going to be
[23:44] passed right here cuz look verse 11 and
[23:48] white robes were given unto every one of
[23:51] them and it was said unto them that they
[23:53] should rest for a while in other words
[23:55] stay right where you're
[23:57] at because cuz we got to work 1260
[24:01] days of this prophecy out right we got
[24:05] to work that out right here once we work
[24:07] that out and then the 144,000 is going
[24:09] to be
[24:11] killed and it was a great Revelation to
[24:13] see like brother Dale was saying that
[24:15] that fifth sealed Jew is going to carry
[24:18] right over in the Millennium because
[24:20] they got white robes
[24:22] right they were giv white robes while
[24:24] they were down here under that under
[24:26] that blood altar cuz look white robes
[24:28] were given and it was said that they
[24:29] should rest yet for a while so they're
[24:31] giving white robes they're put in a rest
[24:33] place then they're going to be
[24:36] resurrected I love that they're going to
[24:38] be resurrected and then go right on into
[24:40] the Millennium because who better knows
[24:44] how to build a temple number one as Jew
[24:46] right and who better to know that that
[24:48] Millennium is to them that's right
[24:51] that's what they're waiting on they're
[24:53] waiting on a millennium they're waiting
[24:54] on that
[24:56] promise of that gold and Jubilee that
[24:59] they never got in the Old Testament the
[25:01] 50 the 50th where everything goes
[25:03] through right right so
[25:05] now there's no combat
[25:09] Beast we see John has moved into another
[25:12] dimension he's not he's not in this
[25:14] Dimension he's got to be able to see
[25:15] into another dimension and see the
[25:20] Altar and the souls under the
[25:23] altar that was slain because of what the
[25:26] word of God the word of God says Jews
[25:28] are my people I'll never forget you as
[25:31] the Sands in the sea and the stars in
[25:34] the
[25:34] sky I'll never forget Israel remember
[25:38] now sure like we were saying last night
[25:39] he was married to them at one time but
[25:42] remember they went horing and he had to
[25:43] divorce them right but that do mean
[25:46] they're not his
[25:48] people cuz that's what Rabbi Richmond
[25:50] said he said he said I can't help it
[25:54] folks I was born a Jew and God loves
[25:58] Jewish people right cuz he started
[26:01] everything through us that's right now
[26:03] whether we messed up down the road or
[26:05] not he still started everything and all
[26:07] of his um examples in the Old Testament
[26:11] of the
[26:12] Jewish
[26:13] lineage that fills the whole Old
[26:16] Testament up but you do see where you
[26:18] come in with a DOT here with Rahab
[26:22] Ruth each one of these little bitty ones
[26:25] that come in here the little Gentiles
[26:26] that is put in
[26:28] there and the Bible does tell in the Old
[26:31] Testament that God will take a people
[26:32] out of Gentiles they'll be Gentiles
[26:35] saved but what they're thinking is see
[26:37] they're switching it around saying okay
[26:39] the messiah's going to come to us he's
[26:41] going to save us take us out of here and
[26:43] and he may take a few of y'all with us I
[26:46] mean really that's what they're thinking
[26:48] we may take a few of them with us you
[26:49] know because of Gentiles or
[26:52] dogs but God has
[26:56] given cuz remember all these
[26:58] other seals power was given to Satan to
[27:02] do something now what God is is God now
[27:05] he's giving white robes Satan can't give
[27:08] white robes that's right there's only
[27:11] one man that can give a white robe white
[27:14] robes were
[27:18] given verse 11 and white robes were
[27:20] given unto every one of them and it was
[27:22] said unto them that they should rest for
[27:24] yet a little while until their fellow
[27:26] servants also and their Brethren they
[27:27] should be killed as they were should be
[27:30] fulfilled so we know one thing's for
[27:33] sure this fifth seal will
[27:37] end sometime after that 1260 day journey
[27:42] of Moses and Elijah preaching to the
[27:44] Israel to I say Israel but
[27:48] Jews um you might say Israelites and
[27:51] Jews are the same thing I don't know but
[27:52] I know one thing God says Jews Jewish
[27:55] the Jewish people and all these people
[27:57] were Jews
[28:01] so there's a place for them and next
[28:03] Sunday or the next Sunday after we'll
[28:05] show you where that place is that
[28:06] there's a place that God has for him in
[28:09] his
[28:10] word because remember this looks like
[28:13] he's a respector of person and the Bible
[28:16] says in many many places that God is not
[28:18] a respector of person but this looks
[28:21] like that God's going to give them
[28:24] something and they've done nothing in
[28:25] return for it they actually laughed at
[28:28] and put him on the cross that's right
[28:30] right that's why he said let his blood
[28:32] be on us and our children that's what
[28:34] put them right
[28:35] here let his blood be on us and our
[28:38] children brother said all down through
[28:40] the generations it throw them into a
[28:42] place to where what God couldn't talk to
[28:45] them no more unless under the message of
[28:48] their hour you understand cuz they are
[28:50] listen there are going to be Jews that
[28:52] are going to be given are no sorry there
[28:54] are Jews now that are bride yeah
[28:58] cuz you got to remember the 120 were all
[29:01] Jews and they were the bride that
[29:03] started then probably some of the 3,000
[29:06] sure they were nations in different
[29:07] places but then you come up to Cornelius
[29:10] and all in the in the book of Acts that
[29:11] God was dealing with Jews so there's a
[29:14] lot of Jews that's that's not under
[29:17] that this is all Jews that
[29:20] rejected Christ while he was on
[29:23] Earth to a
[29:25] degree cuz boy you have to go back to
[29:27] where brother Brown says word rejectors
[29:29] go to
[29:29] hell and if they turn the word of God
[29:32] down but now
[29:34] remember if they don't
[29:38] know God blinded their eyes BL to the
[29:42] truth you have to see it to so he
[29:44] blinded he literally blind put his hand
[29:47] over their eyes so that you and I could
[29:49] come in right so to honor that he's got
[29:54] to do
[29:55] that to honor to be a just God to to be
[29:58] just that he passed judgment on these
[30:00] people before they were even
[30:02] born and put his hand over their
[30:05] eyes there's one word that that sums all
[30:08] this up and we'll talk about next Sunday
[30:10] it's a little early but let's go ahead
[30:12] and go don't want to get starting
[30:14] something else but pray for me I'll be
[30:17] in New Mexico next week
[30:19] so and brother Ryan will take
[30:39] yeah hey that's a good idea
