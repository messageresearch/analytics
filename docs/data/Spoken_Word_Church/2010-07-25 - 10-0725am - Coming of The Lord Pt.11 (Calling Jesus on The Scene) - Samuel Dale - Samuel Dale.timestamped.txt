[30:49] touch with brother Burley he's supposed
[30:51] to be bringing some of his people over
[30:53] but we will see about that later you
[30:56] know just remember that remember Wade
[30:58] will be preaching this afternoon so
[31:01] remember him our wife's going to try to
[31:02] come this afternoon to church if she can
[31:05] to uh you know to be with us and she
[31:08] wants to come but just remember her
[31:10] there's one spot there that's really
[31:12] been giv her a lot of problems and they
[31:14] say it's a a normal part of the um
[31:18] operation for that to happen but it's
[31:21] one one spot about that big and it just
[31:24] burns and does things but there's no
[31:26] blood clots no nothing like that that is
[31:28] just a a problem that goes with that
[31:31] form of operation so we ask you to just
[31:34] keep praying for that the Lord would
[31:36] bless him and I heard that they said
[31:38] Brother Dean down preaching for brother
[31:39] Harris today that the Lord will bless
[31:41] him all right Psalms 1118 and Mark
[31:47] 4 and we're going to have our Bible
[31:50] study this coming Saturday but we've got
[31:52] to get together with some of them after
[31:54] service to because there's a birthday
[31:58] conflict into that but we'll see how
[32:00] it'll work out in you know doing what we
[32:03] can do but we will be having the Lord
[32:05] will in our Bible study okay father we
[32:08] thank
[32:10] you we thank you most of all the fact
[32:12] that you gave us salvation amen because
[32:15] without salvation there would be nothing
[32:17] in any of us that would be worth
[32:21] anything but you saved us you chose us
[32:25] and thank you Father we ask ask you now
[32:28] that you would just come and do as you
[32:31] promised and it's not as the prophet
[32:33] said one day it's not hard to ask God to
[32:37] fulfill his word because you promised it
[32:40] so then we just ask you to come that's
[32:43] the simple point of believing you and
[32:45] then we must believe that you are here
[32:47] to make yourself manifest among us we
[32:50] love you and we thank you we ask you to
[32:52] be with each one of these be with the
[32:54] sick remember our wife Lord and just
[32:56] reach down and touch that
[32:58] place that's bothering her so much cuz
[33:01] we know that there's by the the surgery
[33:03] and all father that there's things that
[33:05] will be there but we don't have to relax
[33:09] and let anything be that would be one
[33:12] tormenting thing we can pray and believe
[33:15] that you will take care of all things
[33:17] and we thank you have your way now
[33:18] forgive our sins and just guide each one
[33:21] of us and keep us in Jesus name amen

[34:02] will praise the Lord this gate of the
[34:05] Lord into which the righteous shall
[34:07] enter see that's that's the Gate of
[34:09] righteousness
[34:11] right I will praise thee for thou has
[34:16] heard me and art become my salvation the
[34:19] stone which the builders refuses become
[34:21] the head stone of the corner this is the
[34:24] Lord's doing it is marvelous in our
[34:26] eyes this is the day which the Lord hath
[34:29] made we will rejoice and be glad in
[34:32] it save now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh
[34:36] Lord I beseech thee in now
[34:38] Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in
[34:41] the name of the Lord we have blessed you
[34:43] out of the house of the Lord amen all
[34:47] right let's go over to
[34:51] Mark
[34:52] 4 we'll begin reading about verse
[34:56] 35
[34:58] and the same day when e the evening was
[35:01] come he said unto them let's let us pass
[35:05] over unto the other side and when they
[35:08] had sent away the multitude they took
[35:11] him even as he was in the ship and there
[35:15] were also with him other little ships
[35:18] and there arose a great storm of wind
[35:20] and the waves beat into the ship so that
[35:22] it was now full the original says
[35:25] filling you know so
[35:28] as he was in the hinder part of the ship
[35:31] asleep on a pillar and they awake him
[35:33] and say unto him Master CEST not that we
[35:37] perish and he arose and rebuked the wind
[35:39] and said unto the sea peace be
[35:42] still and the wind ceased and there was
[35:44] a great
[35:45] Cal and he said unto them why are you so
[35:49] a so
[35:51] fearful how is it that you have no
[35:55] faith and they feared exceedingly and
[35:58] said one to the other what manner of man
[36:00] is this that even the wind the sea obey
[36:03] him you may be seated the Lord add his
[36:05] Blessing to the reading of the word I
[36:07] want you to notice they were afraid of
[36:10] the storm
[36:13] right right they were afraid of the
[36:16] storm but when he rebuked it and and
[36:20] peace was
[36:23] still then they afraid of
[36:26] him
[36:28] right because they realize
[36:31] hey this man must be something and even
[36:35] the wind and the waves obeys him right
[36:38] so I think it's thing if you'll notice
[36:41] that throughout the message today I
[36:43] think that's the point I want you to
[36:46] get because being afraid of what takes
[36:50] place in the world is one thing being
[36:53] afraid of being killed being afraid of
[36:54] being run over by a car Etc whatever
[36:57] that's one
[36:58] thing but we should all always be in an
[37:03] attitude of being fearful that's right
[37:07] of not believing
[37:10] God CU that was what he was rebuking him
[37:15] for they had seen great things take
[37:18] place but yet here they was having
[37:20] problems so just you know remember that
[37:23] all right
[37:25] now the Lord willing to I forgot got
[37:28] brother uh George Quinn from Ireland
[37:30] will be with us next Sunday the Lord
[37:32] willing preaching for
[37:34] us I believe that's right there week
[37:37] after
[37:42] next yeah but we can't do it week after
[37:44] next going got the
[37:46] wedding so that's what we done talk
[37:48] about we got to figure out something but
[37:50] brother Quinn will be with us preaching
[37:52] for us in a weekend or
[37:54] so I was thinking he was coming back the
[37:57] 8
[37:58] to preach but yeah next
[38:01] weekend I got this whole month all
[38:03] messed up okay we'll keep it straight
[38:06] anyway I come to a church we'll be here
[38:09] me today don't worry about it all
[38:12] right cuz I put down on mine and I got
[38:16] dates I guess different but anyhow we've
[38:18] been talking about now on a little
[38:21] subject that I've been concerned with
[38:24] and this is not new for me to preach on
[38:28] this
[38:30] because uh about somewhere a little over
[38:32] 30 years
[38:33] ago I begin to see something that I
[38:38] believe was very important unto each and
[38:41] every one of us and it was the coming of
[38:45] the Lord amen amen and I know there's a
[38:47] lot of things and a lot of ideas and you
[38:50] know we at least should all be away from
[38:54] the uh Lord descended from heaven you
[38:57] know with a shout and a great big you
[39:00] know all over the world and and then aot
[39:04] and we we we can get rid you know pretty
[39:06] well easily get rid of those things amen
[39:09] because we can hear the prophet right
[39:12] but uh I'm wondering do we see it cuz
[39:15] this is my point as I said and this has
[39:18] been my point for over 30 years well
[39:20] over that I quit trying back then I saw
[39:24] something that I realized that we need
[39:27] to know and one of the things was that I
[39:32] quit trying to go to heaven amen amen
[39:35] right you know it's naturally
[39:37] everybody's goal and idea and thoughts
[39:39] are going to heaven right right you know
[39:41] I mean sure but what I mean by that was
[39:45] I begin to realize if the Lord doesn't
[39:48] come here amen that's right and take us
[39:52] D amen then we're not going there amen
[39:57] that's that's the what I begin to
[39:59] realize and then I begin to try to
[40:01] preach on
[40:03] it and uh you know to see that what is
[40:07] the second coming of Jesus
[40:11] Christ now you're a prophet of God said
[40:13] it's the bride coming of Christ amen I
[40:17] gave you all of those quotes trying to
[40:19] back up and review just a little you
[40:21] know he said the bride coming of Christ
[40:25] coming out of the church
[40:27] amen well now that was his definition
[40:32] okay okay so now we got to go with his
[40:35] definition that's right mine and yours
[40:37] don't Mount to a hell of B all right
[40:41] what you think what I think that don't
[40:42] have to do with it cuz that's what
[40:44] happened in the garden the prophet said
[40:46] he said I think and that's what messed
[40:48] the whole thing
[40:49] up now we got to
[40:52] think but just remember we better think
[40:55] according to the word according to his
[40:57] now then we've come to the point of
[41:00] realizing like the prophet said on page
[41:03] 308 of the seal
[41:05] book he said the the second
[41:09] coming is the rapture amen
[41:14] amen then it should be tying together
[41:17] with us to where that we can see that
[41:20] all the things the prophet has taught us
[41:23] are tying together into a beautiful
[41:26] picture right because he said we don't
[41:29] he doesn't come here in a Corporal
[41:35] body he doesn't come phys physically
[41:38] Among
[41:40] Us he said we meet him in the a right
[41:44] all right so the second coming will be
[41:47] to meet the Lord in the act right you
[41:50] say no that's going see that's the
[41:53] problem then we've got to see that the
[41:57] the things that he has told us tying
[42:00] together over all of the time that as we
[42:03] were given to you I think is what the
[42:05] Holy Ghost given for right where he said
[42:08] that Jesus would become visible right
[42:12] Among Us come on Amen and raise the Dead
[42:16] come on and we go into
[42:18] Rapture now then our human
[42:23] mind automatically relates visible
[42:28] to
[42:30] materialistic things you
[42:33] know W flesh
[42:36] whatever but we got to remember the
[42:39] prophet is the one with the answers not
[42:41] you and I right so whatever our brain
[42:43] tells us is always
[42:47] what connected to the senses and the
[42:51] senses has got a
[42:52] problem so then we've got to take what
[42:55] the prophet said amen so he said he
[42:57] become visible Among Us that doesn't
[42:59] mean he becomes Corporal or physical he
[43:03] even as I gave you the other day I can
[43:05] show it to you where he said that these
[43:07] people that say they got blood on their
[43:10] hands and on the forehead and and oil
[43:12] and things he said they don't realize
[43:15] what they're saying right he said
[43:18] because if you have that then you must
[43:21] have the Corporal body you know the
[43:24] physical body would have to be here if
[43:26] you you got the oil you know anything
[43:29] that would come from him if you got the
[43:31] blood especially then you would have to
[43:34] have something real and see that
[43:37] wouldn't tie it together he said they're
[43:39] messing up the scriptures all right so
[43:41] now I didn't say these
[43:43] things and I'm like Paul said have I
[43:46] become your enemy because I found what
[43:49] the prophet
[43:50] said Is that West taken it I've become a
[43:53] lot of people's enemy because I I found
[43:55] where the Prophet said
[43:57] what I was talking about right all right
[44:00] so in doing that then now thinking about
[44:03] the second coming as the bride coming of
[44:07] Christ
[44:09] then we should be realizing that to be
[44:14] among
[44:15] us that God will be here Among Us in
[44:19] such a way and I believe that until he
[44:22] will raise the dead and we'll go into
[44:24] Rapture I believe that amen all right
[44:27] now how does he become
[44:30] visible which I gave you the definitions
[44:33] there Wednesday that visible means to
[44:36] like to see in the eye right or Webster
[44:40] says in other words apparent to the eye
[44:43] something you can
[44:45] see well now brother you're saying that
[44:50] he's not here physically and then you're
[44:53] saying that he's here enough to be able
[44:56] to see him now I I didn't say that
[44:57] brother brandham
[44:58] did all right let's get that straight I
[45:01] didn't have enough sense to say that and
[45:04] neither did you or anybody else go we
[45:07] carnality all right but now then it must
[45:11] be that the prophet he given us the
[45:14] definition right amen of the scriptures
[45:17] all the way through that he can be so
[45:21] real here in you and I
[45:24] until he can change these bodies right
[45:27] right and take us in the Rapture and
[45:29] then we meet him in the a because
[45:31] remember the second coming of Jesus
[45:34] Christ has got to be covered as the
[45:36] bride coming of
[45:38] Christ right then he comes to the two
[45:41] witnesses to
[45:43] Israel but that's not a physical body
[45:47] well now wait wait a minute now now
[45:49] brother the Bible says they say where
[45:51] did you get your nail prints that's true
[45:53] okay so those two prophets makes them so
[45:56] rich
[45:58] until they see the nail prints that's
[45:59] right has not this Prophet made so real
[46:04] to you the death the resurrection Etc of
[46:08] the Lord Jesus Christ and you say you
[46:11] can't see the nail prints in his
[46:13] hands because your Prophet said that
[46:16] would be one thing that would be left
[46:18] even when we get there he will always
[46:21] have those nail prints in his hand where
[46:24] do we see it by Revelation amen
[46:27] so how do we see the resurrection by
[46:30] Revelation right how do we see the
[46:32] change of these bodies by Revelation how
[46:35] do we see these things by Revelation oh
[46:38] that's just head knowledge I didn't say
[46:40] that I've been accused of being
[46:43] intellectual in the basis of that I'm
[46:46] just like a Baptist is just found where
[46:48] the Prophet said it and can read it well
[46:50] okay why hasn't your Holy Ghost found it
[46:52] come on me that's all I got to say I'm
[46:55] not Argan with nobody
[46:57] I just say why has it your holy ghost
[47:00] that you say you
[47:01] have that you are and say I'm just
[47:04] intellect well at least one thing Lula's
[47:06] got it sewed in the seed in the
[47:09] field that's up to God to Quicken
[47:12] it cuz I can't Quicken it brother Rand
[47:14] couldn't Quicken it brother Rand said
[47:16] even the Lord Jesus said my own life did
[47:19] not reveal that unto thee right so now
[47:21] it's got to be the
[47:23] Lord okay now so we hold the point and
[47:26] get it in right doing right see so
[47:29] now the prophets
[47:33] spoke and they done is I was trying to
[47:35] bring Wednesday
[47:38] night
[47:40] before that God could come to the
[47:45] Earth in his first
[47:48] coming the prophets declared
[47:52] that you agree they declared his first
[47:55] coming you know Isaiah and all of them
[47:57] you know virgin shall conceive so when I
[48:00] say something in a minute remember that
[48:03] point and then don't try to make me
[48:06] something that I'm not saying remember
[48:08] the prophets the word we went through it
[48:11] the brother Rand went through the
[48:12] message called Masterpiece where he
[48:15] covers Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph as
[48:17] the
[48:19] foundation then he covers the prophets
[48:21] building the body and then John being
[48:23] the last one to come to introduce the
[48:25] head all right then you have seven
[48:27] Church ages and you are have it there
[48:30] that we're built on the foundation of
[48:32] the Apostles and Prophets all right just
[48:36] as they were see we're not built on just
[48:38] the apostles we're built upon the
[48:40] apostles and the prophets of what was D
[48:43] because if this is not what was D we
[48:46] better be hunting something
[48:48] else but now we're built on the
[48:50] foundation Apostles and prophets then
[48:52] down through the church ages God has
[48:54] been building a body and the light was
[48:57] to be the prophet of melachi 4 to come
[49:00] to introduce the head so it ties
[49:02] together identically with the scriptures
[49:04] as to where the old and the new is to
[49:06] bring forth then the second coming is
[49:09] not a halfhazard happening right it took
[49:14] 4,000 years to bring to pass the first
[49:18] coming what's the problem would taken
[49:22] 2,000 years to fulfill the second coming
[49:26] CU now ours were that people would
[49:28] differ with me about what I
[49:31] believe I believe the second coming of
[49:33] Jesus Christ started on the day of
[49:35] Pentecost right Amen in the hearts of
[49:38] the Saints where do you think his second
[49:40] coming
[49:43] started if his second coming didn't
[49:45] start in the the new birth then they
[49:47] explain to me why Jesus had to be born
[49:51] amen he had to be born to bring the
[49:54] first coming into being right all right
[49:57] is that sensible right amen see then in
[50:00] the second coming of the Bride coming of
[50:03] Christ coming out of the church well now
[50:05] brother Dale the book of Acts never come
[50:07] out of church you better read the book
[50:08] of Acts and study your prophet's
[50:11] message cuz they were sure a whole bunch
[50:13] of garbage back there right read what
[50:15] the Apostle Paul was saying about it
[50:18] right Grievous wolves among you amen
[50:20] read what was happening in the book of
[50:22] Acts and see if they wouldn't things
[50:24] taking place we want to read about the
[50:26] good things but we want to read about
[50:28] the bad but it was there in the book of
[50:31] Acts cuz the Antichrist John said he's
[50:35] already with
[50:36] us he were looking for the Antichrist to
[50:39] come to last day John said he was
[50:40] already with
[50:41] us now remember what your Prophet
[50:45] said he said what happened back there
[50:49] was that when Jesus Christ came on
[50:54] earth right he said Judas
[50:58] came are you with me but he said when he
[51:03] came back on the day of Pentecost and
[51:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said
[51:06] the Antichrist
[51:08] came see we want to talk about the
[51:10] Antichrist in the end time well John one
[51:12] that said it he said he's already with
[51:13] you he said he that deny that Jesus is
[51:16] the
[51:17] Christ he
[51:20] Antichrist now so is the second
[51:23] coming the second coming is not complete
[51:26] yet
[51:28] right you know
[51:31] what I mean you say that's a bold
[51:33] statement brother Dale well hey I'm
[51:36] looking at you and you looking at
[51:39] me if your Prophet is right when he said
[51:42] the second coming is a Rapture oh we've
[51:45] been in that thank
[51:49] you I'm glad you're thinking bless it
[51:53] because remember I made a statement I've
[51:55] never preached on it yet
[51:59] your Prophet said the seventh seal is
[52:01] the coming c o m i n coming of the Lord
[52:08] right which means it is a process taking
[52:13] place right amen would you agree to that
[52:15] statement right it's a process taking
[52:19] place but the word come does not have
[52:23] that meaning to it
[52:25] right
[52:28] but he gave us the definition of coming
[52:30] right now the first coming the prophets
[52:33] had to bring
[52:36] it and declare it all right now who was
[52:40] it down through those prophets was it
[52:44] not the word that they were bringing
[52:46] right amen all
[52:49] right is that true the word they were
[52:51] bringing right who was that Christ amen
[52:55] like brother ROM would say I I couldn't
[52:57] understand how Moses could tell God a
[52:59] better way of doing things he said until
[53:01] I realized it was Christ right in Moses
[53:04] amen so now who was it they doing it
[53:07] until they were actually called Gods
[53:09] Come
[53:11] On To Whom the word come to Jesus said
[53:14] right he have any trouble relating to it
[53:16] cuz see he was standing there knowing
[53:18] that he was the Fulfillment of all of
[53:20] those prophets right amen can't you see
[53:24] the wonderful position that this last
[53:26] day Prophet was standing to stand there
[53:28] and see the
[53:31] things amen if the Apostle Paul could
[53:34] say hey
[53:38] brothers you haven't added one thing to
[53:41] what I've said is that what Paul said
[53:44] that's paraphrasing the scripture but
[53:46] that's what scripture said he said you
[53:47] done added one thing to what I said well
[53:50] how much more could this end time
[53:52] Prophet stand and say you haven't added
[53:55] anything to what I've said
[53:57] said because if for certain one thing we
[54:00] better not add to what he said we got a
[54:02] problem in the Bible right all right but
[54:05] getting the point
[54:07] now those
[54:10] prophets actually the word through those
[54:14] men actually delivered unto the world
[54:18] God
[54:19] Almighty in human
[54:22] flesh okay
[54:25] now you know what
[54:27] though if they hadn't said it it
[54:31] couldn't come to pass now let's get on
[54:33] to the message
[54:35] today if they hadn't said what they
[54:38] said Jesus couldn't have come that's
[54:41] right amen it's always he God he can do
[54:42] anything he wants to he can't do
[54:45] anything outside of what his word says
[54:48] that's exactly will do amen so don't go
[54:52] you know up and off with your fancy
[54:53] computer brain and try to Out quote me
[54:57] on it just sit back and listen then
[55:00] later tell me I don't agree with you
[55:01] that's all
[55:02] right but
[55:04] listen the prophets spoke the
[55:10] word and then God made it come to pass
[55:16] right amen okay right and that's the
[55:18] point of the message today okay and
[55:21] you'll get the title in a
[55:24] minute all right now now this was what I
[55:27] was trying to get across this past
[55:31] Wednesday if we don't confess that we're
[55:34] healed then God is not obligated to heal
[55:39] us you ain't do anything he wants to no
[55:42] he can't go contrary to his word right
[55:44] okay that's what your Prophet said now
[55:48] he said God can't go contrary to his
[55:49] word so don't worry about it there's
[55:51] plenty in the
[55:53] word but what I like was the time he
[55:55] said it boy had to swallow but he said
[55:57] if you can find in the Bible what God
[56:00] says and said you can call him on the
[56:02] scene and if he don't do it you can call
[56:05] him a liar right I now bu that's strong
[56:10] right cuz see we was all taught that
[56:12] well God done this and God could do
[56:15] anything he wants to you remember the
[56:17] old saying was uh you know could God
[56:20] create a rock that he couldn't pick
[56:22] up you know all of that doing is trying
[56:26] to to twist our mind it's impossible for
[56:30] him to create a rock that he couldn't
[56:32] pick up
[56:34] right but we think well now wait a
[56:36] minute now well you go on then you go
[56:39] create you a rock and try to pick it up
[56:41] see now
[56:43] listen for you to be healed you've got
[56:46] to say that you are healed amen that's
[56:49] right amen right right now you must
[56:53] speak the
[56:55] word and and then God can come and honor
[56:57] it now you see the background the
[57:00] prophets spoke that word and it produced
[57:04] God in human
[57:08] flesh now you and I must speak the word
[57:11] now according to Romans 10 about verse
[57:15] 9 we must believe in our heart and
[57:19] confess with our
[57:21] mouth before we can be saved is that
[57:23] scripture right but are we like the lady
[57:27] that said the other lady you know said
[57:29] brother Brown was talking one day said
[57:30] this lady said I got the Holy Ghost last
[57:33] night but said don't tell
[57:35] nobody he said now I don't bless you got
[57:37] it that's right that's right that's what
[57:39] he said that's right amen yeah who are
[57:42] you well he was a prophet that's who he
[57:44] was he was just being honest cuz the
[57:47] Bible says it that's right the Bible
[57:50] doesn't just say believe in your heart
[57:51] and you're saved right that's only half
[57:54] of the situation right now if you want a
[57:57] high salvation go ahead and do what you
[57:58] want to but see you must confess
[58:04] right if we're healed we must confess
[58:07] we're healed
[58:10] right amen before God can come on the
[58:13] scene and reveal that now watch what
[58:16] I've been trying to get here's the point
[58:18] now so is it with the second coming of
[58:21] Jesus
[58:22] Christ amen if someone doesn't confess
[58:27] that he's here and it be to real now be
[58:30] real now a't talking about we've been
[58:32] talking about second coming of Jesus
[58:34] Christ ever since he left right
[58:36] amen now that don't mean anything about
[58:39] it they put it in the newspapers right
[58:42] it all over the world that don't mean
[58:43] anything about it
[58:46] right what I said about healing why is
[58:49] it you say by Stripes I'm heal by
[58:51] Stripes I'm Healed you Ain heal he ain't
[58:54] believe you know what
[58:56] it don't come to pipes right now we use
[58:59] that propped up situation Abraham waited
[59:02] 25
[59:04] years I'm waiting too well that's all
[59:07] right good fine if you're
[59:10] waiting

[59:54] see what it was all right they walk in
[59:57] there and look at it and you know I just
[1:00:00] I'm just as happy as can
[1:00:02] be well it could have been a spider I
[1:00:04] said

[1:00:37] him right up front I said I am not going
[1:00:41] to take your chemo do everything else

[1:00:46] so they run their test and said hey

[1:00:49] you
[1:00:51] okay what it matter to
[1:00:54] me I'm kind of like my
[1:00:56] uncle was he was he got married when he
[1:00:58] was 80 something years old the fourth
[1:01:01] time and you know he finally
[1:01:04] died I don't know how old he was he was
[1:01:06] in his 80s but I told someone I said my
[1:01:08] Lord something had to get him well you
[1:01:12] know you can't just keep living but now
[1:01:14] listen everybody
[1:01:16] understand see I believe that we must
[1:01:19] confess that God is
[1:01:22] here sir now what are you saying when
[1:01:24] you're saying you're healed
[1:01:26] what are you saying amen are you saying
[1:01:30] God is up in heaven now Paul said not to
[1:01:32] do that that's what he's telling us
[1:01:34] there in Romans 10 don't say God is up
[1:01:37] in heaven or over the sea or whatever he
[1:01:39] said tell him God
[1:01:41] here well see if you're healed God has
[1:01:43] to be here to heal you amen it ain't a
[1:01:46] button up in heaven and he clicks and he
[1:01:48] down on Earth something
[1:01:50] happens it's a reality on Earth that
[1:01:53] thrilled me when I first heard the
[1:01:54] prophet and I'll read you quote in a
[1:01:56] minute and remind you of it again he
[1:01:58] said God busied himself like a father
[1:02:01] over his family with the children of
[1:02:03] Israel well you know all I could read
[1:02:05] all the dirty things he do he said he
[1:02:08] was just as happy to be back there with
[1:02:09] him he said like a father with his
[1:02:12] family see we're going to have to get
[1:02:13] away from a lot of these things all this
[1:02:15] that I'm preaching of this series you
[1:02:16] may not think it but this is a
[1:02:18] background for some of the simplest
[1:02:20] messages that I've ever preached in my
[1:02:23] life all right I want to preach on right
[1:02:26] n
[1:02:28] peace but I'm going to preach it in a
[1:02:30] way that I hope God will make it known
[1:02:32] for today amen all right
[1:02:36] now see before God can make manifest
[1:02:39] that he's here someone must say that
[1:02:42] he's here all right what did your
[1:02:43] Prophet
[1:02:46] say Paul said he's not up in heaven
[1:02:50] right right Paul wasn't talking about a
[1:02:53] God in heaven Paul was talking about
[1:02:55] Christ in you the hope of glory and the
[1:02:57] life that I now live in the faith you
[1:03:00] know I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:03:04] God anybody that's ever seen God doesn't
[1:03:06] speak of a God in heaven
[1:03:10] right that's God knows my language and
[1:03:13] I'm
[1:03:14] sorry but what good is a god up in
[1:03:16] heaven bless
[1:03:20] him your Prophet made it like this one
[1:03:23] time he said I'd rather have God's word
[1:03:26] and something to that degree and how him
[1:03:28] then the how concrete poured 100 ft deep
[1:03:32] all the way around my child I'd rather
[1:03:34] have God's word and believe in him
[1:03:39] right we don't realize God in what he's
[1:03:41] doing amen before he can take us away he
[1:03:46] must be here all
[1:03:49] right
[1:03:51] now he will come here and make
[1:03:54] manifest
[1:03:56] in the visible form that he will be in
[1:04:00] right and I'm looking for things your
[1:04:02] Prophet
[1:04:04] said
[1:04:06] uh in conduct order Doctrine huh he said
[1:04:10] after the door the Gentile church is CLO
[1:04:11] GL will ano the church and he'll do in
[1:04:14] one year what theologist tried to do in
[1:04:15] 2000 all right here's where we failed to
[1:04:18] get the other part but he said he's
[1:04:19] doing it now right that was about either
[1:04:22] 59 61 somewhere I know it's back in
[1:04:25] those all right it's questions and
[1:04:27] answers book
[1:04:28] Seven
[1:04:30] now God is waiting on you and I that's
[1:04:36] right okay all
[1:04:39] right he's waiting on you and I right
[1:04:41] right exactly right he's waiting to see
[1:04:44] what you'll do
[1:04:47] amen he's child training
[1:04:50] you what do you think he's been doing
[1:04:52] for 40 something years since the prophet
[1:04:53] has been gone right he's child training
[1:04:57] his
[1:04:58] children he's been putting us through
[1:05:00] trials and tests and problems and
[1:05:02] heartaches and troubles and seemingly
[1:05:04] that he's not even with us like you know
[1:05:06] maybe he's out there in the
[1:05:07] denominations Healing The Sick more than
[1:05:09] he is with Among Us what do you think he
[1:05:11] been
[1:05:13] doing he's been child training us right
[1:05:16] amen hey come on
[1:05:19] folks in the adoption series your
[1:05:23] Prophet would speak of praying for rain
[1:05:27] well now in in a monsoon
[1:05:31] season you don't want to pray for more
[1:05:35] rain so you know what he's
[1:05:39] saying it's got to be dry he was down in
[1:05:42] uh mon in that area down there here in
[1:05:45] Georgia and uh when he got there it
[1:05:48] hadn't rained for quite a
[1:05:49] while that was back in the ' 50s I think
[1:05:52] 55 somewhere in there and he prayed and
[1:05:55] rain came well you know there's no need
[1:05:58] of rain praying for rain if they done
[1:06:00] had 14
[1:06:01] floods
[1:06:04] right I've tried my best to explain that
[1:06:07] to you over and over and
[1:06:10] over how can you how can you manifest
[1:06:14] God as a Healer if you're never
[1:06:19] sick amen oh now I don't want to be sick
[1:06:22] that's
[1:06:24] right like I was saying there the other
[1:06:26] day and a brother called me and said he
[1:06:27] really
[1:06:30] appreciated but you see
[1:06:33] job was perfect in God's eyes and God
[1:06:37] turned him loose to the devil and said
[1:06:39] get after him do anything you want to
[1:06:40] but don't take his
[1:06:41] life that's right you know sometimes we
[1:06:44] kind of wish that he had had said it
[1:06:46] like that you know why cuz he couldn't
[1:06:47] take his wife she was the biggest
[1:06:49] problem he had right he was one that
[1:06:52] said tell him you just Curse God and die
[1:06:56] but see cuz when he said you can't take
[1:06:58] his life couldn't take hers either
[1:06:59] that's it cuz she's part of
[1:07:01] it but he was there because he was
[1:07:04] perfect
[1:07:07] amen oh but that don't sound good your
[1:07:10] Prophet said Satan cannot put anything
[1:07:14] on to you that God does not allow him to
[1:07:19] do is that what your Prophet had to say
[1:07:23] that's
[1:07:24] right well you mean God made me sick
[1:07:28] brother BR said he has to slap us down
[1:07:30] sometimes to get us to be able to sit
[1:07:31] down and shut up long enough to to
[1:07:33] listen oh right
[1:07:36] amen well I think that's what he's been
[1:07:39] doing for about 40 years now 40
[1:07:41] something years he's been slapping us
[1:07:43] around to see what we'll do isn't it in
[1:07:45] adoption where that the the tutor goes
[1:07:48] back and said I made him sick i' done
[1:07:50] this I turned his friends against him i'
[1:07:51] done all these things are you listening
[1:07:53] to the prophet's message that's right
[1:07:56] he said I've done all those things said
[1:07:58] now father he's acting just like you now
[1:08:00] show me where Jesus brother R said he
[1:08:02] Gran with a headache when he raised uh
[1:08:04] that n the baby from I believe it was
[1:08:06] nine that Lazarus when he raised Lazarus
[1:08:09] he he he sat on a rock and grown with a
[1:08:14] headache oh God didn't well your Prophet
[1:08:17] said it that's all right now listen
[1:08:20] here's what I'm trying to get
[1:08:22] to God is waiting on you and I to
[1:08:25] confess that he's here
[1:08:30] right now here's where we
[1:08:32] go I don't want to
[1:08:37] lie that's what people do you never talk
[1:08:40] to people that that you say well now
[1:08:41] what you need to do is confess you
[1:08:43] you're
[1:08:44] healed well I'm not healed and I don't
[1:08:47] want to lie about
[1:08:49] it you ain't never heard people say that
[1:08:52] uh come on you ain't never said it
[1:08:54] yourself
[1:08:59] you know what I'm going to I'm call you
[1:09:00] a liar if you say you don't you hadn't
[1:09:02] so that's just the best way to just put
[1:09:04] the liar out
[1:09:05] there cuz see that's automatically the
[1:09:08] first
[1:09:08] thing I'm not
[1:09:11] healed I still got the lump I still got
[1:09:13] the problems I still got the troubles I
[1:09:15] don't want to lie when God takes it all
[1:09:17] away I'll tell everybody it'll never go
[1:09:20] away the doctor can't take it away
[1:09:23] nothing can't take it away why cuz
[1:09:26] you're accepting what you
[1:09:28] got you're a liar to say that you're
[1:09:33] sick cuz the Bible says what is it we
[1:09:37] sing that song it's coming out of the
[1:09:39] song let the sick say that they're well
[1:09:42] isn't that the
[1:09:46] scripture right when you sound like
[1:09:48] you're gloring in being sick no no no I
[1:09:50] got I'm beyond that now folks don't
[1:09:52] accuse me a lot of things accuse me
[1:09:54] something but than
[1:09:56] that I don't want to be
[1:09:58] sick right and I don't say well God now
[1:10:01] I'm sick for your honor and Glory no I
[1:10:03] say God what did I do cuz that's what we
[1:10:06] do as humans right well what did job say
[1:10:10] God what did I
[1:10:12] do one of these days I want to preach a
[1:10:14] message out of job got something the
[1:10:16] other day where you know have you ever
[1:10:17] noticed that he said back to them
[1:10:18] buddies of
[1:10:20] his he said if you was in the shape I
[1:10:22] was
[1:10:24] in
[1:10:27] you know what he went on to
[1:10:29] say he saidou accusing me of doing these
[1:10:31] things and said you've done things
[1:10:34] too he said what if I brought them
[1:10:39] up we don't want that shot of it oh no
[1:10:43] no no no no one people come to me and
[1:10:45] they say brother Dale I'm sick I said
[1:10:47] okay let's
[1:10:49] pray if you've done anything wrong go
[1:10:52] straighten it up now
[1:10:56] he said what I don't believe I've done
[1:10:58] anything wrong well then all right the
[1:11:00] prophet said if you've done everything
[1:11:03] yielded yourself confessed all your
[1:11:05] wrongs and you're still sick he said
[1:11:07] stand right there now I'm a direct
[1:11:08] quoting he said because God is trying
[1:11:15] you but see oh we want it on the Glory
[1:11:17] Glory Glory side all of it right this
[1:11:20] ain't no glory thing it's glorious in
[1:11:23] what God has revealed unto us amen but
[1:11:26] now
[1:11:27] watch see the second coming of Jesus
[1:11:31] Christ has been a mystery right right
[1:11:34] never to be comprehended by mankind
[1:11:37] Until the End Time amen even though it
[1:11:40] was taking place right the first coming
[1:11:43] of Jesus Christ was not comprehended
[1:11:46] right right that's right the Jews had it
[1:11:49] figured out he was coming yeah yeah
[1:11:51] figured out the great big as the prophet
[1:11:53] said that that great big thing would be
[1:11:54] rolled out and and it roll right up to
[1:11:57] cus you know the high priest and Jesus
[1:11:59] would walk right up to him and say you
[1:12:01] know I finally got here you foke of me
[1:12:03] all this time and you know no the first
[1:12:07] coming of Jesus Christ was a direct
[1:12:08] mystery hidden in the
[1:12:11] word that many things would happen in
[1:12:13] there even that the Gentile garbage
[1:12:16] canned dogs would come into this picture
[1:12:19] yep that Rahab the Harlot and and and
[1:12:22] basba would come into all of those
[1:12:24] things right that's
[1:12:29] right right garbage cans would happen
[1:12:32] but it would bring to Pi that's right I
[1:12:34] don't believe the garbage can brought it
[1:12:36] to
[1:12:37] Pi no it was just
[1:12:41] there I don't agree with a lot of these
[1:12:44] things preached about that you know how
[1:12:46] that Tamar and
[1:12:48] Judah was in the will of God now they
[1:12:50] was it was in
[1:12:53] adultery but was just used to bring a
[1:12:56] natural
[1:12:57] seed cuz the seed they brought was not
[1:12:59] Christ
[1:13:01] right the woman that brought Christ had
[1:13:03] to be a virgin amen not adultery that's
[1:13:05] reason I don't go along with all these
[1:13:08] things now listen remember what I
[1:13:12] stated that I believe cuz I don't mind
[1:13:14] telling you what I believe you know you
[1:13:16] get preachers up and they'll preach it
[1:13:18] this way and they preach it that way and
[1:13:20] after while they get one side of the
[1:13:21] congregation holler amen and when they
[1:13:23] do they just start preaching it that way
[1:13:25] you know they just run with that they go
[1:13:26] to another congregation and the left
[1:13:28] hand side picks it up and they just run
[1:13:30] it that way you tell me it don't happen
[1:13:32] now can I just tell you what I
[1:13:35] believe I believe the second coming of
[1:13:37] Jesus Christ started on the day of
[1:13:38] Pentecost when the new birth struck into
[1:13:41] the heart of man what are you talking
[1:13:42] about in the second coming if the first
[1:13:44] coming was God in human flesh come on
[1:13:47] what would be the second coming your
[1:13:49] Prophet kept saying God in human flesh
[1:13:53] amen that's what's got to be here before
[1:13:55] we're going to be taken out of here
[1:13:57] listen to what your Prophet had to say
[1:13:58] now go to your notes on number one on
[1:14:00] Christ The Mystery of God revealed and
[1:14:03] listen to
[1:14:04] it I at least try to bring to you what
[1:14:07] the prophet said and I encourage you to
[1:14:09] read the whole
[1:14:13] message 1963
[1:14:15] 728 all right and all these things tped
[1:14:19] him just in time but yet the mystery was
[1:14:24] hid them men didn't know what they were
[1:14:26] doing they only knew that they were led
[1:14:29] by the spirit to do something now
[1:14:31] holding it back listen in the last days
[1:14:35] for the great Revelation now he's jumped
[1:14:37] all way over here right right but
[1:14:39] expressing
[1:14:41] it expressing himself in Moses and David
[1:14:44] and Joseph and Elijah on down true you
[1:14:48] we we could take each one of those
[1:14:50] prophets and bring their lives out and
[1:14:51] sure it express Jesus Christ perfectly
[1:14:54] exactly
[1:14:56] yet never giving his secret in full
[1:15:00] right amen waiting for to make it known
[1:15:05] in the last
[1:15:07] days as he
[1:15:10] promised
[1:15:11] listen waiting for it to be fully
[1:15:16] comprehended before he could express it
[1:15:20] if he told the whole thing because the
[1:15:22] Bible's written in mystery Jesus thank
[1:15:24] the father they was wrote in Mysteries
[1:15:27] right waiting for it to be comprehended
[1:15:34] understood now brother R says God first
[1:15:40] what he does
[1:15:43] it then he reveals
[1:15:46] it and then he'll make it
[1:15:51] manifest no so he's waiting for it to be
[1:15:57] understood
[1:15:59] now we believe the new birth was down to
[1:16:02] the
[1:16:03] ages right but we believe also that the
[1:16:07] bride during those ages was caught up in
[1:16:12] Catholicism so it would have to be the
[1:16:14] end
[1:16:15] time that something would have to take
[1:16:19] place but then you can see that it's the
[1:16:21] bride coming of Christ is coming out of
[1:16:23] the church right amen
[1:16:25] Martin Luther came out of the Catholic
[1:16:28] church
[1:16:31] right but brother Dale I never been in
[1:16:33] the church well then you just born one
[1:16:36] right Born between the serpent and Eve
[1:16:38] now not the Beast and Eve brother R
[1:16:40] didn't say that he said you're born
[1:16:41] between the serpent and E what you're
[1:16:43] born in a mind of
[1:16:44] carnality and we got to be birt out of
[1:16:47] that the new birth doesn't give you
[1:16:49] another mind or brain that's
[1:16:52] right it only gives you eternal life in
[1:16:55] your
[1:16:56] soul but if you can't see that's his
[1:16:58] coming into you you got a problem
[1:17:01] right all right now how did the prophet
[1:17:04] say it he comes three times first he
[1:17:07] comes to redeem his
[1:17:09] bride next he comes to get his
[1:17:12] bride the next time he comes with his
[1:17:15] bride okay easy to see number one easy
[1:17:18] to see number three right right look
[1:17:22] back at the first coming look over to
[1:17:24] there and we right back in the
[1:17:25] Millennium right all right but what
[1:17:28] about coming in his bride
[1:17:32] amen well I can see it in brother
[1:17:34] Brandon and I don't have to see it in
[1:17:35] nobody else well oh my okay brother
[1:17:37] Brand's on one going that's
[1:17:42] right sorry that's right you differ with
[1:17:46] me whatever you want to do that's just
[1:17:47] blun to me that's just the way I see it
[1:17:50] right brother randam didn't give you a
[1:17:53] new birth right the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:55] can only give you a new birth that's why
[1:17:57] I was quoting while ago that Jesus said
[1:17:59] my own life didn't reveal that because
[1:18:01] the prophet Christ the my God reveal he
[1:18:03] said the Holy Ghost is the only revealer
[1:18:05] of the word
[1:18:07] right so while Jesus was here in flesh
[1:18:10] he could not reveal that's right
[1:18:13] anything about those things and as a
[1:18:15] matter of fact your Prophet said he did
[1:18:17] not know about his second coming now
[1:18:21] better put another quote in there he
[1:18:23] spoke more of his second coming than he
[1:18:25] did his first coming so you better get
[1:18:26] it right now
[1:18:28] yeah he said he didn't know when he's
[1:18:30] coming back but said after he come to
[1:18:32] John on
[1:18:34] patmas then he realized then why because
[1:18:39] it starts off on patmas what Revelation
[1:18:42] the Revelation that God give to Jesus to
[1:18:44] give to John amen then he knew about his
[1:18:48] part in the second
[1:18:50] coming and he could see what was
[1:18:53] transpiring if you see it anything
[1:18:56] outside of the new birth and the growth
[1:18:58] development into you you know and to
[1:19:01] where that we come up to a place that
[1:19:03] the word will be so prevalent in us that
[1:19:05] it will change these bodies and we'll go
[1:19:06] into Rapture then you go ahead and
[1:19:08] believe what you want to believe that's
[1:19:10] that's just the way I believe
[1:19:12] it now say who are you well that's same
[1:19:15] thing to you who are you
[1:19:17] right no problem but
[1:19:21] listen waiting for it to be fully
[1:19:24] comprehended
[1:19:26] ended you said what was he talking about
[1:19:29] there if talking about the mystress why
[1:19:30] I invite you to go back to the whole
[1:19:32] book because the whole book of Christ
[1:19:33] The Mystery of God revealed is the
[1:19:35] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ right in
[1:19:38] a three-fold revelation what all God was
[1:19:40] he poured into Christ all Christ in the
[1:19:44] church and to take her back to the
[1:19:46] Garden of Eden or restore Fallen Eve
[1:19:48] right I believe it's Fage 74 Christ of
[1:19:51] mystery that brother Brandon said the
[1:19:53] bride is part of the mystery
[1:19:55] and she must be revealed right I'll give
[1:19:59] you another one that's God of this evil
[1:20:00] age I'm pretty sure I'm looking at the
[1:20:03] quote but in my mind but he said that
[1:20:05] God is not complete without
[1:20:07] you that's exactly right even said to
[1:20:11] godhead is not complete without
[1:20:13] you now waiting in the this day
[1:20:19] now listen to the point of what I'm
[1:20:21] trying to get
[1:20:23] now
[1:20:27] Israel believed in a historical
[1:20:34] God they were down in
[1:20:37] Egypt they had lost
[1:20:40] Joseph they lost the contact
[1:20:45] of knowing
[1:20:50] god they had come out of it as a
[1:20:52] historical point now you
[1:20:55] are you listening in other words you
[1:20:56] know what I mean by historical they came
[1:20:59] him out of it caring the
[1:21:02] Scrolls they came out of it
[1:21:05] carrying even Moses with the Scrolls and
[1:21:09] so much until Moses and the things that
[1:21:11] would take place but yet they never did
[1:21:13] believe
[1:21:15] it you said they didn't well right how
[1:21:19] about when he come over there and said
[1:21:20] well let's go up and they said no we
[1:21:22] don't want to go up right
[1:21:25] well the next day they changed their
[1:21:27] mind but you know what happened by the
[1:21:29] next day God had said you're not
[1:21:33] going so they said we're going well they
[1:21:36] lost a bunch of people and they come
[1:21:39] back knuckled under Moses and tried to
[1:21:43] believe now those were human people
[1:21:45] trying to believe without the baptism of
[1:21:47] the Holy
[1:21:49] Ghost the waiting in the days of the
[1:21:52] children of Israel was on the problem of
[1:21:56] the
[1:21:58] people it was not on God's problem
[1:22:02] right God had Moses out in the
[1:22:04] wilderness the whole
[1:22:06] time
[1:22:07] right for 40 years he's on the backside
[1:22:11] that's right 40
[1:22:13] years God was waiting on
[1:22:16] Israel brother Brandon said they had to
[1:22:19] be crying out for a deliverer before God
[1:22:22] seen it right amen
[1:22:26] okay now but Moses was there ready all
[1:22:30] the time see God's been ready all of
[1:22:33] this time but he's waiting on you and I
[1:22:38] right he's waiting on you and I to do
[1:22:40] something that is very sensible let's
[1:22:43] read a little bit
[1:22:44] now lifting God out of History I would
[1:22:48] invite you to listen to that message uh
[1:22:51] await Jesus and then calling Jesus on
[1:22:54] the I think he's two or three of
[1:22:56] those this is preached 1958
[1:22:59] 101 he's talking about a
[1:23:02] historical that's a historical
[1:23:05] God that give the
[1:23:07] promise see what's underlined there now
[1:23:10] to start
[1:23:11] there and we're the people today of his
[1:23:14] pastor with a sheep of his fold and he's
[1:23:16] waiting on us to stand and call him on
[1:23:19] the action call him on the
[1:23:23] scene watch him go in to move
[1:23:27] us watch him do the
[1:23:30] Supreme watch him do the thing that man
[1:23:32] will wonder and scratch their heads and
[1:23:35] not
[1:23:36] understand he's a historical God and a
[1:23:40] present day
[1:23:42] God he's waiting to be called out of
[1:23:45] History Israel had a historical
[1:23:49] God you know they believed in
[1:23:53] right
[1:23:55] but when God appeared They Crucified
[1:23:59] him right so he's still
[1:24:05] historical ever present water from the
[1:24:07] rock
[1:24:08] 61723 this great Pentecostal move today
[1:24:10] now how much great signs and wonders and
[1:24:12] all was among the Pentecostal group when
[1:24:15] brother was preach brother R was
[1:24:17] preaching back there the 40s 50s and up
[1:24:19] into the
[1:24:20] 60s look and this great Pentecostal move
[1:24:23] today God is waiting for you to call him
[1:24:26] on the
[1:24:28] scene you're not out of speaking
[1:24:30] distance with
[1:24:33] him listen though we've done
[1:24:36] wrong and
[1:24:38] sinned and turned their backs on
[1:24:41] him think of the children of Israel that
[1:24:43] I said a minute ago and all the dirty
[1:24:46] things they've
[1:24:47] done but God was right there with them
[1:24:50] 10 times they sinned against him before
[1:24:53] they become to C Baria and they were
[1:24:56] ready to go
[1:24:58] across and God would have still took
[1:25:01] them but they disbelieved his word amen
[1:25:04] all the other things was disbelieving
[1:25:06] this disbelieving that gripping and
[1:25:09] complaining about this and that and the
[1:25:10] other in the
[1:25:12] wilderness but when they disbelieved his
[1:25:14] word he said Into the Wilderness you
[1:25:18] go until you get rid of all of that so
[1:25:21] look though we've done wrong and sinned
[1:25:23] and turned backs on him and and done
[1:25:26] things we ought not to do but yet he's
[1:25:30] with us Christ said he would be with us
[1:25:33] the Bible says the waters followed the
[1:25:35] children of Israel when they got thirsty
[1:25:37] they know the water was
[1:25:38] near all the garbage that was taking
[1:25:41] place but it still
[1:25:43] fed awaking Jesus 631
[1:25:47] 117 you know what he's doing he's here
[1:25:50] tonight waiting to be proved that's
[1:25:53] right you you know what we ought to do
[1:25:56] we ought to do like they like they wait
[1:26:00] Jesus that's in
[1:26:04] us they woke him up in a boat
[1:26:07] right right now this is not waking him

[1:27:07] time when Trouble Comes that we say to

[1:30:27] afraid to call Jesus on the scene to say
[1:30:31] Lord you promised it now do it
[1:30:38] right you remember what I said when I
[1:30:41] first read the
[1:30:44] scripture the disciples were afraid of
[1:30:46] the
[1:30:47] water the problems they were
[1:30:52] in that was one form of fear of
[1:30:57] dying would you remember what we
[1:31:03] read they were more afraid when they
[1:31:05] realized who was in the boat with
[1:31:08] them reach your
[1:31:11] Bible they were
[1:31:13] afraid because they realized this man
[1:31:17] could stop the winds and the
[1:31:20] waves do you actually want God to come
[1:31:23] in your Pres
[1:31:25] presence come on
[1:31:27] brother that's a good question come on
[1:31:30] your Prophet preached the message do I
[1:31:32] have to emphasize a lot of
[1:31:36] it he said if you can't turn around in
[1:31:39] the clothes you got on and face the Lord
[1:31:41] Jesus that's men women whatever right he
[1:31:44] didn't say women only you know if you
[1:31:47] can't turn around and face Jesus you're
[1:31:52] afraid
[1:31:54] right
[1:31:56] amen and you say you have the new
[1:32:03] birth does our actions and reactions
[1:32:06] show that we would be willing for him to
[1:32:09] walk right down through
[1:32:14] here I've told you many times I believe
[1:32:16] in the FF

[1:32:21] the five-fold ministry we're not looking
[1:32:24] for another Prophet to come no but
[1:32:25] there's prophets in the fivefold
[1:32:27] ministry right and if I knew a brother
[1:32:29] had a real genuine gift of calling out
[1:32:31] our sins I'd call him up and get him

[1:39:11] H you read all what I gave you looked on
[1:39:14] the number nine on your notes calling
[1:39:16] Jesus on the scene preach 1964 uh 3:19
[1:39:20] notice after these disciples found
[1:39:22] themselves at the end it must have doned
[1:39:23] on them of doned on some of them that
[1:39:27] the Creator was still with them I hope
[1:39:29] it does that to us tonight amen of
[1:39:32] Hebrews for Hebrews 13:8 says he the
[1:39:34] same then what did they do they awaken
[1:39:36] Jesus gowake Jesus wake him call him on
[1:39:39] the scene he's very easy called you
[1:39:43] remember the prophet where he explained
[1:39:44] how that he went down when he was
[1:39:46] invited down and he knew they was going
[1:39:47] to make fun of him he still
[1:39:52] went he he very easily called they had
[1:39:55] seen so many things that God had done
[1:39:58] and the and the words of vindicating him
[1:40:01] so have we and he was not hard to be
[1:40:04] called into action to woke him up and
[1:40:05] said do you car us not that we perish
[1:40:09] you say how can we be sure of this can
[1:40:12] we prove it John 14:12 Jesus said he
[1:40:16] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:40:17] shall he do also that's exactly our
[1:40:19] faith brings Christ in our presence amen
[1:40:22] right what about the next one calling
[1:40:24] Jesus on the scene
[1:40:26] 64319 notice when you call him on the
[1:40:28] scene notice let us awake him back above
[1:40:31] there I got a circle where you say we
[1:40:33] see his promises then call him to
[1:40:35] confirm his word and the thing that he
[1:40:37] promised to do the way he he we would
[1:40:40] know in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:40:43] in the last
[1:40:44] days would be like it was in the days of
[1:40:48] Sodom he promised that Revelation to the
[1:40:50] church when he would be revealed so
[1:40:53] don't doubt and
[1:40:55] fear call him on the scene for it's to
[1:40:57] awaken him in our s ourselves call him
[1:41:00] on the
[1:41:02] scene remember the rock never left
[1:41:05] Israel never present water from the rock
[1:41:08] Israel left the rock it forgot about the
[1:41:11] rock being with them all the time it was
[1:41:13] right there went right with them to the
[1:41:14] end of the road it followed them it
[1:41:16] wasn't out of speaking distance it
[1:41:18] wasn't out of hearing distance or it
[1:41:20] wasn't out of seeing distance and
[1:41:22] neither is Christ with the church today
[1:41:24] he's not out of speaking distance some
[1:41:26] of you have backslid and done that which
[1:41:28] is wrong and you lost that joy and your
[1:41:31] water is dried up he's still in speaking
[1:41:34] distance of you he follows you he knows
[1:41:37] every move you make and everything you
[1:41:39] do he's longing to hear you call him on
[1:41:42] the
[1:41:44] scene call him on the
[1:41:47] scene 1964
[1:41:50] 319 now can't your faith come come to
[1:41:53] that can't we call him on the scene call
[1:41:56] him on the scene your faith is the only
[1:41:58] thing that can do it now you believe
[1:42:00] that with all your heart each one of you

[1:42:34] was challenged
[1:42:36] overseas Billy

[1:44:03] the Virgin
[1:44:05] birth you think you don't do that you
[1:44:08] think I don't do

[1:44:15] father's business but to show that he
[1:44:17] was God and what he was
[1:44:20] doing the Bible said he went home and
[1:44:23] was subject right unto them them that
[1:44:27] had lied about
