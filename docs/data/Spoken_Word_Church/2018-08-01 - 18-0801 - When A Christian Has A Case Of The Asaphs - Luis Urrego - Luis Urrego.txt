father here this evening we commit this time into your hands now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Lord bless you all and I trust that you are doing well amen if we want to we want to turn to the Scriptures in Psalms chapter 37 Psalms chapter 37 amen in verse 23 verse 23 substance of steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down I like that for the lord upholdeth him with his hand amen praise the Lord Jesus well you may be seated this afternoon amen I like that scripture and that's one scripture that I've always had in my mind ever since I was a young man when I was in high school in ninth grade I went to Bob Jones Academy in Greenville South Carolina after going the public school for a while and my mom and dad you know they thought that by taking me out of public school and putting me in a Christian school that everything you know that everything was okay everybody there loved the Lord and everybody but it was far from the truth it's it's you got more rebellious kids there than you probably have in the public school and bar because partly 50% of them don't want to be there they're forced to be there so of course you know and then all that you know you get you get armed with the wrong crowd and here you go at private school where your mom and dad said you know going to school and they're gonna come out real true Christians you know and that's what's where everything went downhill for me amen until God amen God in His mercy amen though he fall he shall not utterly be passed down amen because the Lord upholds him with his hand amen and so there and when I was in the Baptist Church that was one of the scriptures that that that really always draw my attention because during the time that I was out and sin and doing things I wasn't supposed to be and and you know going through the motions of life you know trying to find who who who myself you know who whatever what is it that I wanted to do in life and then when these scriptures really I was wanting certain my flesh in my in my the spirit wanted things of the world but then when the Word of God like this would come amen it would put me to think and say Lord this is really me this is really me although I want I'm putting the facade in front of my friends like this but this is really me right here so this scripture was really special to me and I wanted to read it tonight because we want to talk about a man by the name of Asaph Amen how many have heard of Asaph before amen and SF in the Bible he he's very interesting and wrote several of the Psalms actually in the Bible actually he he wrote more of the scripture than then some of the Apostles did in the New Testament Peter a lot of the several of the Psalms are attributed to him and so we want to talk to him we want to talk about him amen and just look at a a specific Psalm that he wrote that he wrote amen and in Psalms chapter 73 amen and if I want to give this a title I want to title it when a Christian has a case of the Asaph when a Christian has a case of the a SEFs because when we read this this Psalm here in just a moment I'm sure that we all can identify with this Amen many times that many things that we go through in our life and things that we ask ourselves you know I mean have you ever asked yourself have you ever been disillusioned by people many times you think people are a certain way and then later they come that you come to find out they're not that way you're you're hurt you know even by your own family you can be hurt those probably the first ones that would hurt you a man you disillusioned by people Asaph went through something like that amen sometimes we ask ourselves you know why is it that things in our life don't work out just exactly the way we thought they were supposed to work out that way we were going this direction we thought everything was was just that way everything was or going honky-dory everything was fine and all of a sudden God just throws in a curveball in there puts in a monkey wrench and and God allows those things why there's a specific reason why he knows you better than you know yourself you think you know yourself and you think that you know the best way to go but you realize God knows you better than you do God knows you better and he understands you better and he knows exactly what you need amen and sometimes you know and I want to give this message to our younger guys and girls but but it's for everybody you know because you know we get to these points that that we have to realize that God is ultimately in control of our lives now we're not robots God is there's not pushing us through tubes or anything like that you still have a decisions that you have to make free moral agency I'm thankful that God gave us free more agency a man you decide Amen what you want to do but God moved before the foundation in the world what decisions you were gonna make and he would make a man proportioned and in in places Amen in situations for you to make that decision they meant praise God so and other questions that we ask ourselves is why we wonder why is it that the faithful suffer a Christian suffers but the but the but the wicked people out here they're they seem like they're does everything's going fine with them you know they get to do everything that they want their parents don't say anything to them they get to do that and and and yet Here I am I'm stuck and I'm I can't do everything in the whole world is doing ACF had questions like that too and he was a hundred years old when he wrote those songs amen he was an old man amen and then we questioned God sometimes God why is it that not it's going this way why is it that I'm why is it that this has happened in my life amen why is it that that I can't seem to get through this trial amen go through this biz setting sin in my life amen sometimes God allows a men God wants you to conquer your you for you to conquer your besetting sin amen or God wants you to conquer that that is holding you back from truly serving the Lord amen amen because again God has given us his word and if we look to his word amen his word has all the answers we think that word doesn't have it's just an old English book it speaks an old English and doesn't know and I can't really relate to it amen but if you really pay attention to what the word is saying look into the word amen and and and say Lord whatever that word says about to me what I read that's for me amen and God gives you a revelation of that word Amen that'll change you even in 2018 the word is still relevant just as it was written amen just as it was spoken before the foundation of the world amen it's still relevant today amen praise God and I'm thankful because there's this eternal word amen praise God so we're just gonna look here just a little bit of just a little bit of background of who Asaph was and Asaph he was a young priest from the tribe of Levi when David brought the Ark of the Covenant up to Jerusalem his father who was beric ayah was appointed the doorkeeper of the arc and a saif was so talented that david put him in charge of the music before the Ark of the Covenant Amen so he SF was a was a singer he was a musician and he he was a musician and a singer from a young man he was put in that position David put him in that position him and David were like this they meant about the if you look back in the history David loved him very much and he loved David a lot and he was willing to serve he served David Amen when David was King and ace F had a brother named Zechariah who helped him he and of course he was eventually murdered by Solomon's agents in the temple according to history speculation and and you can read that in Matthew chapter 23 verse 32 because Jesus says there speaking to the Pharisees he tells them that he says that a that wherefore behold I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them you shall kill and crucify and some of them you shall scour jhin's you're in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the Earth from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias whom you slew between the temple and the altar it's it's some people think that that Zechariah John the Baptist dad some people think that that's Zachariah a saps brother Amen but so nevertheless he was murdered whoever who was they meant and so Asaph he grew up seeing David come to his ascension as king and and saw the the the time that David was king and and in in in in in all this and saw when David came down as king and Solomon took over and he saw even the golden time that Solomon was was a was be as the king and and and he thought that Solomon was a you know he was all in that golden generation that the the children of Israel were and he was part of it he saw it and then yet he saw when Solomon turned to wicked gods to other gods back slid married ungodly women and and and and turned his back on God amen and he saw all that and yet during all that that he saw he had to keep his faith he had to keep his faith in God seeing his own king seeing the people around him turning to other gods and yet he still had to keep himself amen and that's just like less like today you know everybody seems to be turning away from the message everybody seems to be turning away from from following God and following Christ and all the young people that you know they they seem to turn go with the crowd and everybody wears this and everybody does this and everybody has this and everybody does amen and and and and people just follow like flies in this house we're seeing it because history repeats itself amen history repeats itself so it's not anything new amen history repeats itself and everybody turning amen everybody and you everywhere you turn now you you look and people are shouting at you and and and and in saying you know why do you believe such things my mom and dad they believe that and and I believed it and nothing good came out of it and and it's just kind of like the children of Israel when they were walking around the the the what is it the city Jericho and I'm like I can imagine you know the people up there you know they were probably shouting and screaming things at them and saying what are you fools thinking out here shouting and out here screaming and out here doing things ridiculous things out here with your long hair here with your pants out here with your you don't you do this you don't think you don't smoke you don't curse you don't you know what are you all doing but if the children of Israel didn't stick to what God had said amen they would not had seen those walls fall amen because they stuck with the word of the Lord they saw the promise of God be fulfilled in their lives the same thing with you and I Saints if we stick with the Word of God if we stick with the promises of God you'll see them fulfilled in your very in your very life you may not understand how or when how it's all going to transpire but as long as you stay with the word as long as you stay with what you're with what your mom and dad has brought to you ever since you were a little baby because let me tell you if your mom and dad are still here at church and bringing you to church that's a good sign that what they taught you from the beginning is good amen you know because that's their desire is to be more like God and that's the desire for them to be more like God then that's probably the desire today you have for you as well amen so let that desire not be to just observing the Lord just because my mommy and dad serving the Lord I'm serving the Lord because I want to serve the Lord amen praise God amen so in and if you read the Psalms of Asaph you will see how much his Psalms speak of the events of his life and times Psalm 73 reflects a SAVs bitterness at the murder of his brother and you keep reading all the way to Psalms chapter 82 it's at most most of those was a SEF Amen so that's a little bit of Asaph and so he served the Lord ever since he was a young man and you know I was I came to the Lord when I was 12 years old I was twelve years old when when when I accepted salvation and this is all I've known since then before that I was a Catholic and a Jehovah's Witness and you probably don't know what that that some of you may not know what that is I you know some of you may have been Catholic Church and been Catholics but I was the one who would go over there and not to take dip might hand a little water and you know do this yeah and all that stuff I was there I was there with my mom praying with rosaries and with with things in front of it I saw all that statues of Virgin Mary's everything I was all involved that we'd go to the cemetery to pray later it was it would be like 10 o'clock at night praying in the cemetery and be my sisters in me and you know you wouldn't think anything of it because you thought that yeah that's just how you grew up you know but I'm thankful that God amen he's touched my mom and dad's life and you know he can't we came to the Lord amen so because you know you you're you're blind amen but if God doesn't open your eyes amen you're just uh you just keep going that direction amen you keep going that direction amen so let's look at psalms chapter 73 and i just want to take it verse by verse amen i felt led to go this direction tonight and we'll see how the Lord leads us say now now what I did was I took I took Psalm 73 and I put the King James Version at the top which is an italic and then the very simplified version of what that verse is saying right run right under it for you sometimes it's hard to understand the King James Version so let's see what let's see what Asaph says this godly man who served the Lord who was in the Lord service and let's see what happens to him Amen the verse 1 says truly God is good to Israel even to such as are of a clean heart so he's saying God is so good to Israel to those whose hearts are pure now I mean none of us here can deny that some of us we've known that God is good ever since he's we've been little kids God is a good God you know none of us can deny that but look what he says here verse 2 but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well-nigh slipped says but I almost slipped and lost my balance I almost fell into sin this man who loved the Lord who was in the service of the Lord and yet he came to a position in his life where he he almost slipped so good bad things can happen to good people every every every time every time we walk in this life amen you have these mind battles all the time is it worth it to keep going this way is it worth it to keep serving the Lord look I keep falling and doing this this this is it worth it to keep going that's what Satan wants you to do think but God wants you to keep going God doesn't want you to throw in the towel amen God wants you to keep going because he has something special for you something special planned out for you for I was envious at the foolish verse 3 when I saw the prosperity of the wicked in other words I saw that wicked people were successful and I became jealous of those proud people you know me growing up as a young man and I got into rap and hip-hop and all that kind of stuff and you'd see I you know I used to have MTV my mom and dad had MTV at the house music television and not mimic those those got those guys I'd want to dress just like them I'd have chains just like them and do all the moves while I sing and rap and all kinds of stuff and I was a dancer too and I was I was jealous of those people I wanted to be just like that yeah and it's so in us and I know as a younger generation younger young people today amen we want to mimic those who prosper we want to well they're prospering and they're so you know why can't I go that route they seemed like they were going fine why can't I go that route you see in your mind maybe you're not thinking that but I would I did you know and so that's what that's what and this is an older man thinking the same way seeing and remember remember the the background this is during the time when Solomon was King and he was seeing all this prosperity with all this wickedness yet taking place and him being almost pretty much the almost the only one who was really serving the Lord at the time put yourself in his position I saw the wicked were successful and I became jealous of those proud people verse 4 for there are no bands in their death but their strength is firm they are healthy they don't have to struggle to survive your thought of that of the people out in the world I think might they prosper politicians their lies and there are all kinds of stuff but yet seem like they the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poor it seems like yeah verse 5 they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men in other words they don't suffer like the rest of us they don't have troubles like other people to be quite honest with you when I came to the Lord and I really gave my heart to God that's really when the struggle was was when they say the struggle was real that's when the struggle is real that's when it that's when problems came in my life back then you know I could do all kinds of stuff and smoke weed and use drugs and alcohol and all that kind of stuff it wouldn't bother me one bit but then when I came to the Lord when you really really give your heart to God and you really turn yourself to him amen and looking and looking into his word and really want to know more about his will for your life that's one Satan a man he gets he gets he gets to working I said he doesn't want you to be in the in that position that he's in they meant that got that God in the same image as Christ they meant verse 6 therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain violence covers them as a garment in other words so they are proud and hateful this is as easy to see as the jewels and fancy clothes they wear and just because somebody is wearing fancy jewels and fancy clothes out in the world and this is what the hip-hop world shows us that you have to wear fancy clothes and fancy jewels and and fancy shoes and $200 pair of sneakers in order to be you know cool but you look at what direction they're going they think that that's what a Millionaire is and really a Millionaire somebody doesn't really out there displaying their wealth really the one who really has money is not one out there showing showing their wealth throwing their bling and showing it that it's not they're very quiet about their wealth that's the true millionaire right there but the Hollywood the way Hollywood portrays millionaires is there out riding these expensive Hummers and all these expensive cars and all these things and wearing all these necklaces chains and the girls are wearing all these tight clothes and all these you know high heels down the hill and all kinds of stuff like that and think that they got so much money I wish I had that type of money I'm getting me something like that you realize that those people a lot of them they come to not they lose their wealth the majority of them because they don't know how to handle this right that's not how you handle wealth if God's blessed you with wealth Amen God knows that you can handle it therefore he's blessed you with Amen verse 7 their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish if they see something they like they go and take it they do whatever they want that's the world nothing bothers them nothing bothers them they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they speak loft elite they make fun of others and say cruel things about them and their pride they make plans to hurt people amen you know I was reading I was reading the other day about the the things that were said when the Titanic was built and they said it was an employee who was part of the you know ocean liners and things like that at the time they said this Titanic God couldn't even sink it and it was put in and it was recorded in the papers where they said they said that and look what happened to the Titanic yeah I believe it was Nixon I believe he said he said when man went up to the moon and and Nixon said this is the best thing has ever happened since the creation of God you know just lofty things and look look at the way Nixon went right okay his life like the way the Titanic went and then cruise ship I think a war it was white either this Russian spaceman in 1961 or Khrushchev said I went up and dissipated that that spaceman went up to space and he didn't see God up there and all those things all those people are they're not there they're not you know in memory and and your memory anymore you know amen they say lofty things but those that those people they go they come to not amen oh yeah verse 9 they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walketh through the earth they think they are gods they think that that they are the rulers of the earth when the rulers of the earth are our I believe rulers or the other standing right here I believe that without my heart you and I Amen we were this is the Dominion that God gave to you and me a man in the world has no clue whatsoever they think it's the President of Russia who owns they think it's the president of the United States they think that all these glamorous people they're the ones who own the earth when in actuality it belongs to you and I remember what we talked about that Kingdom that Kingdom right now is being set at this very moment in our hearts right now amen in order for us to possess it physically amen praise God verse 10 there for his people return hither and waters of a full cup or rung out to them even God's people turn to them and do what they say my sometimes we get so we we think we need we just need to mimic what Hollywood is telling us or what well politician is saying okay you know sometimes I just can't believe how how incredibly how much people get into politics and we're supposed to be Christians you know when you should know better than that you should know very very far in between that somebody's gonna get up there that's gonna do really what the people want them to do probably very few and and and in the ones that probably would really gonna do what they promised they we're gonna do they never get up there they've never gotten up there as president and has this you know they'll just never get up there so why get into politics and get it and get so consumed by these things it's so consumed by by the trends of this life you know by the by the Hollywood trends that you know you have to dress this way in order to to look cool and and and show that you got something you know a man you know the way you portray yourself on the outside is shows a lot what you are on the inside yeah shows what's going on on the inside right so if you want if you know but then of course many times that that's not the case either you know a lot of times you can dress nicely and you can portray yourself on the outside a certain way but you'd be corrupt totally corrupt on the inside amen that's what we need to hold to God amen and they say how does God know and is there knowledge in the Most High those evil people say God does not know what we are doing God knows God most high does not know behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world not the word the world they increase in riches not spiritual riches physical riches yeah that won't save your soul those proud people are wicked but they are rich and getting richer look what he says look what Asaph says this godly spiritual man in verse 13 verily I have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocency in other words clearly then I gain nothing by keeping my thoughts pure what good is it to keep myself from sin hey he came to this point where he was seeing the wicked doing all of this everybody was leaving the message everybody was was was following after the world and living and looking like the world what point is it to keep myself pure my thoughts pure and to keep myself from sin this man came to this point to think about this how much how much you know our young younger generation Amen when they see all this that's going on into high god Satan's constantly bombarding them with thoughts bombarding you with thoughts you don't have to be 15 or 16 amen I'm 38 I'm bombarded with these thoughts you know why is it you know what's the point of serving the Lord you know I don't see nothing going on yeah I don't see nothing that you know ya better believe that that's Satan talking to you that ain't God that's Satan talking it's definitely Satan amen for all the day long have I been played chaste and every morning God I suffer all day long and you punished me every morning Lord the more I serve you the more I get down to pray the more I go to church the more I give myself to you in every shape form and every aspect every time I come home Airy there's something broken in the house my kid is sick my my family is being torn apart somebody's about to die but God knows you better than you know yourself God knows exactly what you need amen because my trial is not brother Dale's trial right right right God knows brother Dale God knows why he needs a man in order to form and mold him God knows what Esther needs in order to mold her your trial is not the same as nihilus dollars not gonna go maybe the same thing you you go through amen because God knows what she needs to go through in order for her to become like Jesus Christ amen same thing with with me amen God knows me I'm glad that he knows me amen and he knows you they meant verse 15 if I say I will speak thus behold I should defend against the generation of thy children huh I wanted to tell others these things but that would have made me a traitor to your people in other words a salve he wanted to just let the people know I'm ready to give up I'm ready to stop serving God I'm ready to stop doing what I'm supposed to be doing but he didn't want to be considered a traitor to the people apparently there was people who were looking up to him amen there's people that look up to you and I say amen for us to be dealing with the things of the world and they'll be dealing with with the things of you are needed in this hour whether you think you're not amen you're very special and you're needed amen and when one of you is not here amen you're missed you're missed and we're wondering are you okay especially are you okay spiritually amen you know mm-hmm verse 16 when I thought to know this it was too painful for me in other words I tried hard to understand all this but it was too hard for me it's hard for us same entity to think the position that we are at at the very at this moment of our lives I don't know what you're going through I don't know maybe it's something difficult that you're going through right now but God knows all about it right and you don't have to you don't have to explain every single thing that goes on in your life because if he did if you could explain everything then there was the point of having faith what's the point of having faith in God and trusting him if you can explain everything because if you can explain everything and then that puts you on the verge of saying that I know I know more than God and I don't need to serve Him and you won't and you want and you won't depend on him amen in verse 10 and verse 17 and now now look at look at a saps turning point he says until I went into the sanctuary of God then then I understood I understood in their end in other words but dang God I went to your temple and I understood what will happen to the wicked amen and it reminds me a lot of the of the prodigal son you know when he was doing everything he left home and it was spending all the money and living righteously and all kinds of stuff but it wasn't until he came to himself until he realized wait a second this is not where I'm supposed to be amen it wasn't until a SEF came to that point he went into the sanctuary of God now what is the sanctuary of God amen his word is a sanctuary man he is the sanctuary of God amen he is our sanctuary and if you keep going keep going up we're gonna read some verses here look what Isaiah 8:14 says and he shall be for a sanctuary amen speaking of Jesus Christ but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the house of Israel for a gene and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem amen he is our sanctuary Saints where else could we go but to the Lord you know we're going this direction we're thinking a certain way but then when we when we humble ourselves and we look to the word and we see and we allow the word to help us then it can change our thinking then it can change our thinking but if you're haughty if you're if you're if you don't want anything of God if you think you can make it on your own if you think you at your own opinion matters very highly over everybody else's you won't get anywhere with God with that that type of attitude Philippians 4 verse 7 says and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus amen he's the one who can shape and clear our thoughts and put us in the right thinking amen through Christ Jesus does it doesn't say you doesn't say the president doesn't say you know anybody anybody else through Christ Jesus is the way he shall keep your hearts and minds and we can agree that a SEF was going through a tumultuous time not just physically he was seeing physical disaster and destruction around him but he was seeing it spiritually in his life amen he didn't he didn't understand why it was all happening amen let's go to the next verse says in Hebrews 6 verse 17 says wearing God willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us I like this which hope we have as an anchor of the soul amen both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil amen praise God a couple of weeks ago I was doing a Sunday School lesson and I talked about the going into the inner veil right we know that at that time in the Old Testament it was only the high priest could go in there at a certain time of the year right only once a once a year now it's a it's a sin or it's if you don't go in there it's it's death well back then if anybody else besides the high priest went in there it was death now if you don't go in there it's death to you amen as death if you don't go in there now there is no physical place just because you come to church doesn't mean that that will save you just because you sit here and listen to the word that doesn't save you if you don't believe that word receive and believe that word but you by you just warming a bench that doesn't save you that doesn't give you brownie points with God doesn't put a little star you know with God Amen just because you come to church or you read one verse today in the Bible and prayed for three minutes this doesn't give you any brownie points whatsoever Amen right if you didn't totally holy do do it Amen with all of your heart amen cuz God knows your heart amen but we as the high priest would go in there and he and he would go in there with the blood of the sacrifice to sprinkle upon the mercy seat amen and when he would go in there there was the rod of Aaron an old dry rod there outside of the outside of that tabernacle outside of that holy of Holy's it would dry up in Aaron's hand it was dry it was it was proudly sticker II you know it was it was gone it was rotting probably but when it got into the Holy of Holies amen it was reviving again it was it was it was even budding the Bible says and it was an attached to any tree whatsoever although there was a tree there is a tree in there amen the tree of life that's the reason why it was budding and then you also had a man do what they say we have hid us here can we use this but I was might be too heavy let's see so here's the things that we're in there you had Aaron's rod that budded right remember this thing was not was in a place where it wasn't even attached to a tree and yet leaves were coming out of it that's look what happens when you're inside the inner veil and then you had the manna that was gathered the original manner that fell were the first time when the manna fell from heaven Moses was commanded to go get some of that mana and be put inside the tabernacle right and that manna with the if the children of Israel when they would eat that manna they would have to eat of it that morning and then by the evening time it was already rotting so they have to dispose of it by the evening time but yet this original manner which represents the Word of God was consistently fresh inside the interval amen it never rotted it never would would would be bad so when the high priest would go in there when the high priest would go in there he could always take a little portion of that and it's taste just as good as it tasted the first day it felt right amen and that's the same thing a men with with with us to you on the outside that Tabernacle looks like something that there's just scary and something that you know I don't want to go in there but when you really taste of the good word of God when you're really coming to the into the presence of God when you come to yourself just like a SEF did amen and come to his sanctuary because that's what the sanctuary of God represents Amen - holy of Holy's right spiritually when you really come in and taste of this good word of God you'll continue I mean there's nothing that will hold you back amen you won't want to turn back to the world you wouldn't want to turn back to the fashions of the world you don't want to turn back to the music of the world into the movies of the world and to the ungodly things that young people do today out in the world tattoos and nollies haircuts and all these things that they get in they look just like just like the world and we bring in those things in our life you'll never want to when you're really Amen experienced and tasted of the good Word of God amen of the good man of God but you have to dip you have to dip Amen you have you have to go in there and taste it and eat it for yourself God it's not gonna force-feed you and say here you eat this take it no it's there it's always there it's always there but you come and poor take of it you come in poor take up amen so which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which enter it into that within the veil amen whether the forerunners for us entered even Jesus made in high priest forever after the order of melchizedek see Christ he he took care of he was the ultimate high priest right took care of it a man for once and it's done Amen now he wants you to come amen stop dilly-dallying with the world stop dilly-dallying with this things of life these temporal things of life oh I don't know what what am I gonna do this happened in my life and I don't know you know God knows just fall in love with God fall in love with God sometimes we're so consumed they meant by who's we gonna marry and what we're gonna do and with you know and things like that and we fail to forget that God knew that before you were even born God knows that you want a wife God knows that you want a husband if that's your desire God already has it right there ready for you but he just wants you to fall in love with him first and your other partner to fall in love with God first as well thank God can completely Amen when when you both join you'll know it's perfect then you'll know it because both of you are in the word you know yesterday yesterday we had we had these these roofer guys come to our house they were trying to sell us you know a new roof and things like that and there was these young guys one was like 23 and the other was 24 and they found that I was a minister and and and and everything and one of them was getting married getting married in like two months the 24 year old and he said oh man that's great that's awesome you know that you you what church you go to and all that and hope we told them and so right so we got to doing what we were supposed to do there with the thing and then the dura gantry leaving he told me he said can you give me some advice what I can you know some marriage advice you know and I could tell that he was real sincere I really enjoyed talking with him and I gave him some advice I told him let me tell you the first things first when it's it's not you and her getting married she has Christ in her life and you have Christ in her life than it should be three people hid in their they meant in that relationship praise God because then the rest of it will take care of itself when you as the husband amen when the when the husband you as the head when you are in your position then she'll be in her position amen things will fall in line and he's he told me he said and I said you know sacrifice is a very important thing you know and he said well what do you mean he said do you mean like I can't go out with my friends anymore and things like that oh that's gonna stop so let me tell you that's gonna stop but I said let me also tell you this that if you are the right head and you put Christ in your life properly you give her the time that she needs she will live give you the time that you need that's just how it works she'll give she'll know what you need and she'll she'll freely gladly give it if you give her a man because she is the Bible says the Bible says husband's love your wives right but then it says but wives respect your husbands why doesn't it say wives love your husband's it's because wives need to be loved they want to feel love they want you to tell them I love you honey you're the you're the best best wife ever you're the best cook ever you you're you fulfill my life they love hearing those things but a husband doesn't really like to hear those things well he likes to have as his ego rug he loves for you to tell him to for you as the wife tell him honey I'm so glad the way you provide for the family and look how you fixed our shower you did this for me and and I appreciate how you sit down and you play with the children and you're so you're so wonderful like that and you know what that makes the husband feel like home I want to keep doing some more of that yeah you see that's how it works that's how a marriage should work that's why the Bible says husband's love your wives and then husbands risk wives respect your husband because a husband wants respect unnecessarily want lovey dovey type stuff although he should be open to that but what a husband really wants is respect he wants you to respect him amen I don't know how I got into that somebody must have needed it amen praise God so let's go to the let's go - is there another verse after this Pretenders all right so we're back to Psalms 37 hard let's finish up here this is what God gave me so you you you all you all I hope you I hope you enjoy oh he's God surely verse 18 surely thou did it set them in Slippery places now Kassadin down into destruction in other words clearly you have put them in danger you make it easy for them to fall and be destroyed so now now that Asaph was in the sanctuary of God right was in was in in in the word in other words right in the in the presence of God doing what he was supposed to do really in love with God back to himself again amen now God was showing him things that the wicked out here they're they're gonna keep doing they're gonna the wicked still be wicked the the bad people are still gonna be bad the the rich are gonna get richer they're gonna prosper things all that is gonna happen amen but what about you Amen but you don't have to worry about that Amen you what you need to worry about is what God is your relationship between you and God amen verse 19 how are they brought into desolation as in moment they are utterly canoe singing with tears trouble can come suddenly and they will be ruined terrible things can happen to them and they will be finished all these people out here the politicians the the the Hollywood they all a man can be consumed at any moment amen especially when they don't have God in their life amen the sports stars all these these people they're all temporary and just in five years from now they'll be all 10 years from now they're old and you probably may not even know anything about them anymore retired and all kinds of stuff you know like that you know we thought that Michael Jordan when he was put in the 1980s I used to love I love the basketball and and we thought man nobody could could beat him and nobody and now when I look at him giving interviews and stuff like that he's old and getting old and wrinkled and that's the same person you know we think all these are great you know and know they'll know they're invincible but they're gonna get old just like just like all of us are as a dream when one awake is so oh Lord when thou wakest thou shalt despise their image then they will be like a dream that we forget when we wake up you will make them disappear like the monsters in our dreams I'm one that I don't hardly dream but when I do dream something it's dumb that's my wife and I tell my wife it's dumb dreams and but I faint not forget him you know I forget him that's how are these people out in this world they are there they're up up here for a little while and then all of a sudden you'll never hear anything about them again what about the people that were brother Terrence in your time you know and where are they at now the music that you maybe you used to listen to where they at now you know same thing with the people today Amen but how how awesome it is that God is steadfast and you keep God and you start with God at one point and is the same a man in 1960 he was God and then in 1970 he was God in 1980 and 1990 2000 2010 2018 he's still got a man he's never changed and he never gets old and he's here ready to fulfill your need amen that's that's who I want to look up to that's my hero amen thus my heart was grieved and I was pricked in my rains I was so foolish I thought about such people and became upset when you really have God in your life this is what you're gonna think about the world you're so foolish thinking that this that my current estate my current things that I'm going through in my life it's it's you know five years down the road you really like that I was crying because of that I was and you kind of look back and use like God you put me through that position because I am where I am now because of that yeah and I thank you for that so foolish was I and ignorant I was a I was as a beast before you before thee God I was upset and angry with you I acted like a senseless animal how many of us act like that things don't go our way we get so mopey and so sad and so depressed and so feel like though we're carrying the whole world on our shoulders when in reality and then take God by surprise God knew that before the foundation of the world you just had to go through that because God has a better end for you nevertheless I'm continually with thee thou has holdin me by my right hand but I am always with you you hold my hand amen and he said he said that he'll be with us not just with us but even in amen and this is the Old Testament right how much more in this hour when the when the blood has already been applied grace has already come amen how much more is how much greater in this hour thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory you lead me and give me good advice and later you will lead me to glory amen you received that advice amen as children you receive that good advice through your home your parents if your parents are serving the Lord and when you come to church when you listen to the messages you receive that good advice and what are you but what the thing is what are you doing with that advice amen because that advice will lead you to glory man if you say uh I'll just do it later and it would be leading to the same place that the wicked are being led to amen whom have I in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee in having God I have only you and if I am with you what on earth could I want amen what on earth could you want more than God amen there's nothing wrong with with dressing nice there's nothing wrong with wearing good you know nice pair of sneakers and there's nothing wrong with with having nice things you know nothing wrong with that it's your intention behind it amen it's their intention behind it you know I I sometimes people think you know in order for you to look humble you have to you have to look ragged I don't believe in that I don't believe in that I believe in in in especially when you come to the house of God you look you look your best you know I believe that you give God the best that you that you have and if overalls and and the t-shirt is all you have well then then you just give him that sometimes you know we dress up so nicely for a funeral and we come to the house of God it's just any old way we dress up so nicely to two of the Valentine's banquet and that's the only time I see you dressed nice you know and I know that you can wear you can you get you can alright I'll get off of that 26 my flesh and my heart fella but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever may be my mind and body will become weak but God is my source of strength he is mine forever hey man this is the this is this is what Asaph came to amen when he came into the sanctuary of God and gave himself to God and gave himself to look into what God really wanted to tell him amen and stopped looking at the things on the outside this is the things that he was seen for lo day that are far from thee shall perish thou has destroyed all them that go a horn from thee God people who leave you will be lost you will destroy all who are not faithful to you but it is good for me to draw near to God I have put my trust in the Lord God that I may declare all thy works as for me all I need is to be close to God amen I have made the Lord God my place of safety and God I will tell about all that you have done amen praise God that's what happens when you go into that inner veil spiritually you know and you get in the word amen you fall in love with God amen God will reveal things to that you would not have no need otherwise they met praise God amen so with Asaph amen and we're gonna read a couple of scriptures here cuz see you see Asaph he was a godly man that was prone to backsliding right he almost back slid that's what the Bible says amen no but but look what brother Branham says here amen he says in questions and answers he says in 1962 backslidings not lost I want somebody to tell me where backslidings lost and proved it to improve it to the Bible backsliders not lost he's just out of fellowship amen Israel back slid but they never lost their covenant they lost their praises and joy David lost the joy of his salvation when he took bets Sheva Uriah's wife but he never lost his salvation he never said restored to me my salvation he said restored to me the joy of my salvation that's what David what David said Amen so you know young people we US adults you know we we were constantly bombarded with thoughts from Satan constantly and he's always constantly condemning us and you got to remember that every time he talks he's lying you know he's always lying he's a liar from the beginning so there the Bible says there is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus so if you are in Christ Jesus in that interval right you're in Christ in that word Amen feeding off that good word amen praise God there's no condemnation right amen no condemnation for the believer so you can just brush it away and say Satan I won't listen to that I'm below I'm serving the Lord amen and you know sometimes we we all may come to a point where you've done wrong we did wrong things we fail God and sometimes we do it deliberately and that's called iniquity amen when we fail to do what we know we need to do or we don't do what we know we should do it that's called iniquity a not falling into that myself I've gotten to places like that in my life but that has nothing to do with what God started in my soul amen because something or something within me says God you that began a good work in me will the ended amen this has nothing to do with me this believing your word amen I love you Lord and all you got to do is get back up and repent repent repent to the one that maybe you've wronged and move on there's as easy as that but we make it so difficult sometimes we make it like it's this long drawn-out process amen and all it is is just go ask forgiveness to the one you've wronged if you've wronged somebody or and then ask God to forgive you and that's it and in faith just leave it there amen praise God well Bram says in in 1954 questions and answers but I'm backsliding remember you backslide every day Wow there's no way at all for you to keep out of it all right but you backslide to the people and to the people in the church but not before God see see to the people at the church you might be a backslider right but to God amen he sees you as through the blood amen if you're his son and daughter you backslide on Christ but you don't you don't own God because if you when you sin you're gone but you're constantly failing Paul had to die every day is that right he had to die every day repent every day and just constantly repenting all the time see and if Paul had to do that then I'm going to have to as well amen my brother Bram said I'm gonna have to that means he had to do it to mmm you'll make in Hebrews chapter 6 1957 brother Brent says you'll make mistakes you'll fall you'll willfully do wrong you'll go out sometime and do things that don't mean that you're lost amen that means that you're going to get correction that's what that means you know when I was out in the world and I was you know doing the things of the world I knew better my mom raised me different and raised me better and you're not happy you're not totally happy in that life amen you're out here with the can of beer in your hand and you're you're like I know I shouldn't be doing this but to the world they don't think that the one that God has not touched their soul amen they don't think that that that can of beer they're holding and doing the things that they're doing that's all right you know but somebody who God has if God's really touched you your life amen God has really spoken to you my god is really dealing with you amen you won't be the same if you out dilly dallying with the things of the world it'll be different then amen my little boy my little boy lots of times my children will do things yours dust2 that you they they know that that that's against you your rules and they know what to expect when they do it they're going to get a whipping for it sometimes a good one but it's still your child certainly amen it's impossible for that man to ever be gone again that's once been born of eternal life God's not an Indian giver amen he died here with my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall never come to the judgment but passed from death unto life and I'll raise him up in the last days that's God's promise amen you see a true born-again believer is gonna if he fails god he's gonna feel bad about what he's done but if you don't feel anything that I've kind of doubt you've been born again right that's where it all it all basically boils down to hey man cuz we're gonna make mistakes as Christians we're gonna fail amen but if you don't do something about that right away or if something's not tugging as I listened that wasn't right then you have to have to think about yourself am I really born again do I really have the Holy Ghost have I really entered into that Holy of Holies amen with God amen or is the word or am I just retaining the word up here but it's not really coming down here amen amen praise the Lord in Psalm 63 verse 2 look what the Bible says here to see thy power and thy glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving-kindness is better than life man my lips shall praise thee thus well I bless thee will will I bless thee will I lit while I live I will lift up my hands and I name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when I remember the upon my bed and meditate on the end the night watches amen that of us being on our bed at night and then with the cell phone in our hand doing who knows what how much better it is if you just meditate on God praise God cuz that David you know we were saying this of course he didn't have no cell phone back then so that's all they could do turn out the lights and that was it you know son go down that was it amen meditate on God amen because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I rejoice my soul followeth hard after thee I like that hard after thee amen not not but hard I right hand up hold with me praise God amen praise the Lord and it was and we'll read this last quote here brother Branham says and the mercy seat speaking about the mercy seat which no one could approach unless there was an atonement there for that person only way that the sanctuary when it was sprinkled of the blood the sea I have mine brother Anderson fixed it for me so that can't i reaiiy can read this one only way that the sanctuary when it was sprinkled of the blood then it became a mercy seat but after the blood was taken up then it became a judgment seat all right so let's keep reading in other words while the blood was still there on the on on the mercy seat right well the blood was still there a man there was mercy for the people right there was mercy for the people of the blows still there but then come the time loco brother brain says a no mind no one could stand the judgments of God the only thing the only thing that we can look for is mercy not judgment our righteous righteousness we cannot approach his justice because his justice he'll have to keep his word and keeping his word the day you eat thereof the day you die who would want justice I don't want justice I call for mercy my let the mercy of God in the mercy seat sprinkled but there was a time of the cleansing of the sanctuary right when it was a judgement seat as long as the blood was off of the seat there come a time when they would have to cleanse take that blood because there had to be a new blood that had to be sprinkled on the mercy seat but while that blood was it wasn't there there was there was judgment Amen but when that blood was there Amen then it was mercy for the people now we're approaching that time now we are now approaching in this a cleansing of the sanctuary and the judgments coming upon the earth see as long as blood is there God cannot destroy the earth long as blood is there nobody's a sinner before God everybody's right because there's an atonement for everybody all right but if you fail to accept that atonement and go into his presence then you are a sinner in other words you fail to go into that inner veil and to really fall in love with God amen because there's an atonement for everybody but if you fail to accept that atonement and go into present then you are sinner you're beyond that mercy then you've judged yourself but now while there is mercy but when the cleansing of the sanctuary comes the blood goes off the mercy seat and then the wrath of God falls upon the earth oh my god be merciful to us that we be not in that they found without mercies of God amen praise God so Saints so afraid of drop this thing thinks we want to make sure Amen we are in amen always looking to the you have to take advantage Saints young young young man young lady seek mercy and grace while it's sealed can be found you know don't let the world influence you so the world and the life's and the styles of the world and the things of the world they're gonna perish what cain't perish is that word in that work that God's done doing in your life amen and you may not understand it fully Asaph was a hundred years old and he was questioned you can you may come to a point why this is happening to me but stay steadfast to what you learn amen that word that that you heard and that word is gonna keep you that words gonna keep you and in you stayin in with it instead fast with that word you want to know more about God God you're gonna look God will show you more about himself whoever revealed more to you amen when you are when you give him a man what he the the time that he deserves a man with all of your heart praise God but if you do it nonchalantly and if you do it not with your whole heart and the world Steel's tugging at you and pulling at you and you say or you only feel good when you're in the house of God but then what come Monday or come the next day and you're away from church and things like that and you're back again and your normal daily routine amen and you forget about God and then you're around people and you forget that you you even go to church don't be ashamed of Christ amen don't be ashamed of Christ because Christ was not ashamed of you he suffered the ultimate was naked beard poking out of his face pulled out of his face and we we see him on the cross we see him with a little shroud over him but he was he was completely naked he did all of that for you so that you can enjoy living the things of the world no I did that all for you so that you can benefit from him amen let me tell you Saints

promised you don't have tomorrow promised make make make a decision with God why he's still thinking found a man praise the Lord Amen how many love the Lord Amen I know it wasn't anything extraordinary but it was the Word of God so I just hope that you know I blessed me to read a saps life I like to go back into the Psalms I love the Psalms Psalms chapter 37 is one of my favorite scriptures you know I love it Psalm chapter 37 but when you look at AF you know so sometimes we go through just what a scythe when a man we we have a case of the Asaph sometimes but that means we need
