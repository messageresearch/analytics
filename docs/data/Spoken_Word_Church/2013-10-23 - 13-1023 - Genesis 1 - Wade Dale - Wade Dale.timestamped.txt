[3:22] sometime so that's all right brother D
[3:25] wants to start something on Sunday and
[3:27] kind of give me a chance to continue on
[3:29] on our thought with our Genesis 126 and
[3:33] 27 and tonight we're going to subtitle
[3:36] it the DNA of
[3:38] God told you I was going to preach on it
[3:41] about a year ago but uh this is going to
[3:43] start we're surely not going to get get
[3:46] through it
[3:47] but I want you to remember my my two
[3:50] friends brother Sano and brother Jackie
[3:52] Benton I did get a an update on him um
[3:55] the therapists are able to work with him
[3:57] now and they say he'll get about 80% of
[4:00] his movement and voice and all back so
[4:02] we thank God for that 80% is better than
[4:06] 70% you know and brother Jackie he's
[4:09] he's traveled around the world and
[4:10] helped a lot of people so and he's uh up
[4:14] there close to about 80 years old so
[4:16] let's just keep him in your prayers plus
[4:17] brother
[4:18] Sano a young man and U we just pray that
[4:22] the Lord
[4:23] will uh he does these things for a
[4:26] reason uh he said he would put no more
[4:28] on you than you can stand that's right
[4:30] boy sometimes we get to the border of it
[4:33] but he said he would not do it and
[4:35] that's something we got to trust that as
[4:36] much as we got to trust Matthew 28:19
[4:39] and acts 238 we got to trust that just
[4:41] as much as we trust the rest of it all
[4:43] right so let's just remember that
[4:45] Brother D brother Dale announced brother
[4:47] juel will be here next Wednesday he's
[4:49] coming down Monday to hunt with us a few
[4:51] days and preach for us Wednesday night
[4:53] and my buddy Claude said to tell you hey
[4:55] I talked to him
[4:56] today and he's excited about coming uh
[4:58] he'll be here on November the 10th and
[5:01] also uh brother Tom Ernest and his wife
[5:04] are traveling tonight and they're going
[5:05] to be at my house tomorrow just for just
[5:07] for uh to spend the night as they're
[5:09] going on to Baltimore so just keep him
[5:11] in your prayers also uh everybody enjoy
[5:14] Bob and Aon service W Sunday that was
[5:19] good that was really
[5:21] good but I told I told B I told Bob I
[5:25] said you know Bob's young in the in the
[5:28] gospel you know and uh in the ministry
[5:30] and I told him I said now if you want to
[5:33] make he said he asked me one time he
[5:34] saidwell what do you like and don't like
[5:36] I said you know what makes me mad is a
[5:38] preacher will walk up in front of a
[5:39] congregation and he'll say start saying
[5:41] I'm not worthy to be here and and I
[5:44] shouldn't be the one preaching well I
[5:46] want to raise my hand like Terence you
[5:47] know did with Tom Ernest I want to raise
[5:49] my hand and say well sit down then if
[5:51] you're not worthy to preach sit down let
[5:53] somebody else preach this was ordained
[5:56] for this to happen tonight and you're
[5:58] going to you're going to hear from God
[5:59] from me or you're not going to hear
[6:00] anything at all
[6:02] right sorry it's just the way it is all
[6:05] right but we don't make no big eyes or
[6:08] little use it's just that we're put in a
[6:10] spot that uh you know uh brother Dale
[6:14] many times is uh sure he likes to go
[6:17] hunting but a lot of times his hunting
[6:18] out in the woods is thinking about
[6:23] you many times I've told you out in the
[6:26] world when I was out in the world not
[6:27] going to church daddy would come to my
[6:28] house he'd have to church after dealing
[6:31] with y'all now he's got to deal with me
[6:33] and y'all but after dealing with y'all
[6:36] he'd say put on a hunting video or you
[6:39] got a good Western to watch just to get
[6:41] you know to get the Mind get your mind
[6:42] away from from all the uh All the
[6:45] Troubles he said one time he said if you
[6:46] got 20 people you got 20 problems you
[6:48] got 100 people you got 100 problems
[6:50] so but we're just all one in the body of
[6:53] Christ though and there's little things
[6:54] that we have to go through and and
[6:57] little trials and tests so if you got
[6:58] your Bibles let's turn to Genesis 1 and
[7:00] we'll start there
[7:03] and I um I'm beginning a saying
[7:08] tonight I've always it it's all that's
[7:11] another thing that that strikes me is is
[7:15] people say well we'll take what brother
[7:16] Brown said from 63 to 65 but from 47 to
[7:19] 63 it was Progressive and he didn't know
[7:21] what he all he was talking about and
[7:23] then they'll say well the great third
[7:24] pole had not come or the son of man
[7:26] Ministry had not shown up yet he was
[7:29] born a prophet amen uh he answered to
[7:32] nobody but God so if you got to answer
[7:34] for his problems then you must be God
[7:38] okay so I told them Sunday it just
[7:40] struck me somebody was talking about it
[7:42] and and everybody there's a lot of
[7:44] people that won't take 47 to 63 I mean
[7:46] they say well he was this of course a
[7:47] lot of in the ministers meeting they did
[7:49] that because it seems that brother Brown
[7:51] says this here and then after 63 he says
[7:53] this but if you put them together by
[7:55] Revelation he's saying the same thing
[7:57] all right we know that but but I told
[7:59] him downstairs I said I want to know
[8:02] what he said after 65
[8:08] right you go home tonight and sit down
[8:11] and that'll strike you I want to know
[8:13] what he says after 65
[8:16] yeah cuz what he said before 65 can be
[8:19] argued and it is being argued he
[8:23] preached two souls he preached this he
[8:25] preached that but the five-fold
[8:27] ministry after
[8:29] 1965 yeah is supposed to take that
[8:32] message and perfect the people am so I
[8:35] want to know what he said after 65
[8:37] through a five-fold Ministry amen not
[8:40] changing what he said not adding to what
[8:43] he said but telling us what he said amen
[8:45] all right so that's what I believe that
[8:47] that we've got a five-fold Ministry that
[8:48] perfected the Saints I don't think
[8:50] people were perfected before 65 now
[8:53] brother brandham could come to adoption
[8:54] we know that
[8:56] but it wasn't for them so I want to know
[8:58] what he said after 65 Brother Gary
[9:00] through a group of people through the
[9:02] bride that's supposed to bring us to
[9:03] rapturing Faith all right from the
[9:06] message of the hour so so if anybody
[9:08] ever says anything to you tell them we
[9:09] believe in this church we believe
[9:10] everything he says after 65 yeah right
[9:14] that's right that's the truth right
[9:17] everything he says after 65 you know why
[9:19] because brother de it's got to be a
[9:21] revelation if it's not a revelation
[9:24] they'll preach Two Souls out of that
[9:25] message they'll preach seven th virtue
[9:28] they'll preach per they'll preach no
[9:30] Holy Ghost Doctrine where do you think
[9:31] all of them came from from 47 to 65
[9:35] that's where the doctrines came from so
[9:37] I want to know what the spirit says to
[9:39] the church that's here in the end time
[9:42] so let's bow our heads before we get
[9:45] started dear heavenly father we pray
[9:47] tonight
[9:48] that you'll come Lord as a active
[9:51] participant in the
[9:52] service and not just a record of our
[9:54] thoughts and our ideas that it not be
[9:56] our thoughts and our ideas that'll be
[9:59] you doing the speaking Lord you doing
[10:00] the hearing cuz you said faith comes by
[10:02] hearing and hearing of the word of God
[10:06] and how can they hear un L they hear a
[10:08] preacher and unless he be sent it's just
[10:11] vain words father we pray that you'd be
[10:13] with us tonight take care of us lead us
[10:15] and guide us by your Holy Spirit May the
[10:18] words be pleasing to you Lord may you
[10:20] forgive us of our sins and our many
[10:22] human stupid mistakes that we make Lord
[10:24] in life that you'll clear those out Lord
[10:28] and that you'll bring us to words Lord
[10:29] that we need to hear father be with the
[10:32] ones that are sick brother Sano brother
[10:33] Benton these things happen for a reason
[10:36] Lord but we still know that you are
[10:37] Jehovah Gyra we still know you are the
[10:40] provider you're the one that that heals
[10:42] and you're the one that that will raise
[10:44] them out of that situation thank you we
[10:47] pray that you'd bless the ones in the
[10:48] congregation Lord thank you for being
[10:49] with each one be the ones that are not
[10:51] here take care of us and lead us guide
[10:53] us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name we
[10:54] pray amen Genesis 1:26 and 27 and God
[10:58] said let us make man in our image after
[11:01] our likeness and let them have dominion
[11:02] over the fish of the sea and over the
[11:04] foul of the air now look he's given
[11:08] us something to do all right watch and
[11:13] over the calal over all the Earth and
[11:15] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[11:16] upon the Earth so God created and we're
[11:19] going to look at these words in a minute
[11:21] when I let you sit down so God created
[11:23] man in his own image in the image of God
[11:26] created he him male and female created
[11:29] he them all right and God blessed
[11:32] them so they're already blessed right
[11:35] amen that group of people is already
[11:37] blessed God blessed them the Creator
[11:39] blessed them and God blessed him and
[11:41] said unto them he said right straight to
[11:44] them not through a second person right
[11:47] God spoke directly to this group of
[11:49] people and said unto them be fruitful
[11:52] and multiply and replenish the Earth and
[11:56] subdue it look at all these ANS and he's
[11:59] piling things on and have dominion over
[12:01] the fish of the sea and over the foul of
[12:03] the air and over every living thing that
[12:07] moveth upon the Earth amen
[12:12] H you say
[12:15] okay what are we going to do in the
[12:17] Millennium what are we going to do in
[12:18] the future home right we'll have
[12:20] dominion over every right living
[12:23] creature amen that's right animal and
[12:28] man
[12:30] you may be
[12:31] seated H you say oh that's too strong no
[12:35] I don't think we've I don't think we
[12:38] found what we're looking for yet in this
[12:40] Genesis 126 and 27
[12:43] man I think we're just hitting the
[12:45] surface we're just scratching the part
[12:48] that we're supposed to see because
[12:52] remember whoever these people
[12:55] are they're sinless yeah right
[13:01] whoever these people are they're sinless
[13:04] God's already blessed them amen God's
[13:06] given them a Dominion God's told him
[13:08] what to do he's told him to replenish
[13:11] the
[13:14] Earth what a group of people right now
[13:18] let's look and see in Genesis 1:27 it
[13:21] says so God created now we're we're
[13:24] looking at that word and I was uh
[13:26] speaking to the ones in in Calhoun past
[13:29] weekend we look at that as created as
[13:32] there was nothing and then there was
[13:34] something
[13:35] created okay but now watch remember the
[13:40] thoughts in the mind of God is eternal
[13:43] amen
[13:44] okay it just developed when he spoke it
[13:49] right now remember we have thoughts in
[13:52] our mind about building a building
[13:53] buying a car choosing a spouse whatever
[13:57] but we can make mistakes States because
[13:59] we're born on the earthy side we'll get
[14:01] into that in a minute but God was not
[14:04] built on the Earthly side right God was
[14:07] built on the heavenly side am so he
[14:09] can't make a mistake whatever thought
[14:11] comes into his mind it has to be
[14:14] expressed
[14:15] right or he's not God
[14:18] right and see now we don't understand
[14:21] that to a degree because we're
[14:24] human we decide to do this and deci God
[14:28] said see it says God said Genesis 1:26
[14:31] God said so it's going to happen Okay
[14:35] God said it so God created let's look up
[14:38] that word create in the Hebrew because I
[14:41] want us to look we're talking about the
[14:43] DNA of God now I want you to kind of
[14:46] bear with me because later on you're
[14:48] going to have to shove this a little
[14:50] while and then and then I'll bring it
[14:52] out later on Look up the word or the
[14:55] phrase gene
[14:57] expression
[14:59] because DNA is what is that big long
[15:02] word deoxy ribonucleic acid it's the
[15:05] strands of life ain't that right Aaron
[15:07] he G me a yay buddy well hey I said
[15:09] something about you preaching and you
[15:10] wasn't back there so you back there now
[15:12] so you did a good job wonderful job but
[15:15] DNA is the very strands of life and gene
[15:19] expression is if you if your genetic
[15:21] makeup was to have black hair there's
[15:23] nothing you're going to do about it to
[15:24] change it right that's your expression
[15:28] if my genetic makeup was to walk like my
[15:30] grandfather which mother says I do I
[15:34] can't change that yeah why because it's
[15:38] a gene being
[15:40] expressed that I have in me that I have
[15:42] no control over right now we getting
[15:45] somewhere because the DNA of God has to
[15:48] be the same way right not the earthy
[15:52] we're going to read here not the earthy
[15:53] but the Heavenly amen all right the
[15:57] earthy one is the one you see now it's
[15:58] the one that did come from Samuel and
[16:00] Peggy Dale that made me walk and talk
[16:01] and act and do like I am
[16:05] aale gene expression right so that Gene
[16:09] has to express
[16:11] itself amen so we're looking at this
[16:13] Genesis 126 and 27 you know I got
[16:15] something against you guys listen let me
[16:17] ask let me ask you a
[16:19] question if we agree on something or if
[16:22] we're as a church and I don't think
[16:26] we'll too be too fanatical to do this
[16:29] but when we have new ones here and they
[16:32] just come into church and Daddy's trying
[16:35] to back up a little bit and he goes
[16:36] through water baptism and he goes
[16:38] through no eternal hell and we just sit
[16:41] there you know if I was new you know
[16:44] what I would do I'd say these people
[16:46] don't believe what he's saying yeah he's
[16:48] the only one that believes what he's
[16:49] talking
[16:50] about how about a little hearty amen
[16:52] every once in a
[16:54] while and that's not put on that's right
[16:58] that's not put on you should say
[17:02] amen amen well I know about water
[17:04] baptism I've been water baptized for 40
[17:06] years well you know what that person
[17:07] hadn't right and when you first heard it
[17:10] you know what if you sitting in a dried
[17:11] High church and they never nobody said
[17:13] amen you'd probably go I don't know if
[17:15] they believe what they even say right
[17:18] just an amen you don't have to shout
[17:20] youin got to run the aisles just say
[17:22] Amen in unison amen let's do it one time
[17:26] amen now doesn't that sound good see
[17:29] that means you agreed with what I
[17:32] said now if we had somebody new here
[17:34] they'd go boy them people believe what
[17:36] he say so you know just try to do that
[17:39] we've got a lot of new people coming in
[17:41] and
[17:42] out something's something's got to
[17:45] strike
[17:46] somewhere because they're coming
[17:49] close I mean we're looking for the last
[17:51] one everybody is and then the last one
[17:53] walks in and we don't
[17:56] amen if that's the one we're looking for
[17:58] that's the one that's got to be born
[18:00] again before we get out of here I don't
[18:02] care what we do all right we can still
[18:05] sit here all day and go to funerals
[18:08] which I hate to go to
[18:10] funerals
[18:12] amen cuz if time goes on I'm going be
[18:14] coming to
[18:17] y'alls
[18:19] y'alls amen just say amen amen amen but
[18:24] look but look watch now let's get back
[18:26] but really when somebody comes it's not
[18:28] a show we should amen all the time but
[18:31] at least give a good hearty amen when
[18:32] brother Dale you know he was saying
[18:34] something the other day and and uh I
[18:37] said amen but nobody did and we had like
[18:40] four new ones well when they're new
[18:43] they're they're real they're real
[18:46] soft they're
[18:49] very
[18:52] impressionable they're very
[18:54] impressionable you were very
[18:56] impressionable when you walked into a
[18:58] church church and you're trying you're
[18:59] like a sponge you're trying to soak all
[19:02] this up you know that brother that
[19:03] brother West I don't know if you don't
[19:05] mind me calling his name but he was
[19:07] sitting back there on the edge of his
[19:08] seat Sunday listening to what brother
[19:10] Bob had to say on the edge of his seat
[19:13] not
[19:15] asleep he was on the edge of his seat he
[19:18] was setting up just like this had his up
[19:20] here on the I mean he was back there but
[19:22] he was up here he was right sitting on
[19:23] the edge of the seat and he was soaking
[19:25] it in amen well hey man what greater
[19:30] opportunity to let your light shine you
[19:32] don't have to go downstairs and testify
[19:34] to him just say
[19:36] amen amen amen means so be it so we got
[19:41] we need to so be it a little bit
[19:43] more but remember that comes from your
[19:46] DNA
[19:49] makeup of God yeah you got to overcome
[19:52] the one that Mom and Daddy gave
[19:54] you because that Genesis 126 and 27
[19:57] group ain't quiet right right amen they
[20:01] ain't quiet they going to shout when we
[20:04] get to Glory they're going to shout
[20:07] right cuz they had a birth but now
[20:11] watch the word created when God
[20:15] created see look what he did he says to
[20:19] create obviously but look to shape or
[20:23] form to fashion right so what did he do
[20:27] he fashioned a group of people just like
[20:30] him
[20:33] exactly he fashioned a group of people
[20:37] just like him not different cuz remember
[20:42] we were made in his what
[20:44] image and if his image is thus that's
[20:48] why I said Gene gene expression if
[20:50] you'll look it up it'll strike your
[20:52] heart because the reason I look the way
[20:54] I do is because of them two right their
[20:58] Gene is expressed in
[21:01] me
[21:03] naturally now what about when we're born
[21:05] from above right amen doesn't matter
[21:09] like like Bob said Sunday doesn't matter
[21:11] if you're ugly that McCarthy guy whoever
[21:14] he's talking
[21:15] about I think he would May talking about
[21:17] himself he just using another
[21:21] name an
[21:23] alias but you know it it doesn't matter
[21:26] it's like Bob said he said you look
[21:27] somebody said
[21:29] how in the world that guy God use that
[21:31] guy well that ain't none of your
[21:32] business right and he can't help the way
[21:35] he looks because of his mom and daddy
[21:38] right but the character brother brandham
[21:40] always said look at their
[21:44] character he said I don't care if the
[21:46] guy smells like a
[21:48] horse right he went through a whole
[21:50] whole list I don't care he said but if
[21:52] the man has character GL okay well
[21:56] that's what God's looking for you know
[21:57] what he's not not looking for your
[22:00] character he's looking for his character
[22:05] right shape and form right
[22:09] fashion of Heaven and Earth obviously
[22:12] and of individual man and of new
[22:17] conditions
[22:20] right he knew we would be born humans
[22:23] that wasn't that wasn't a surprise to
[22:26] God he knew we were going to be humans
[22:30] that's why the the the the great
[22:32] teaching now that we're hearing on for
[22:34] knowledge is probably one of the
[22:36] greatest things that's helped me in the
[22:39] whole message not just one item not just
[22:41] predestination but the whole
[22:43] message to me is based on a revelation
[22:46] of for knowledge because a revelation of
[22:49] for knowledge will take a quote that
[22:51] seems Seems you hear me seems off with a
[22:55] quote that others want to use and you
[22:58] know what with for knowledge and the
[23:00] revelation of for knowledge and how for
[23:02] knowledge has been placed in the word
[23:04] they come together right they come
[23:06] together
[23:08] right that's where you get good teaching
[23:11] good teaching does that you know what
[23:12] teaching places you in the body what it
[23:13] puts you in a place to where you
[23:16] rest right you see people they're tossed
[23:19] to and fro
[23:21] why no good
[23:23] teaching they just get good preaching
[23:26] amen right preaching saves people I has
[23:29] no no doubt brother J for tell you he's
[23:32] an evangelist period he don't want to be
[23:34] nothing else you know what he gets
[23:36] people to the altar he gets people saved
[23:37] he gets results with prayer you know
[23:40] what that's his job right and you know
[23:42] what he doesn't step out of that that's
[23:45] why I know that that's a true gift that
[23:46] he's got he doesn't step out of that
[23:48] gift you know why that's the gene
[23:50] expression right that God saw a black
[23:55] man that has been off offered several
[24:00] churches he's been offered several
[24:03] churches to be a pastor and could have
[24:05] done it just like that and he's turned
[24:07] them down every one of them right and he
[24:10] goes out on the field 88 different
[24:13] churches he preached at a couple years
[24:15] ago different churches now there's only
[24:16] 52 weeks in a year so figure that out he
[24:20] preached a lot I didn't say 88 sermons I
[24:23] said 88 different churches he preached
[24:25] in so you know what he's getting the
[24:28] gospel out though and he's getting the
[24:30] people he's an evangelist so he's doing
[24:32] his job he is expressing what God saw
[24:35] before the foundation of the world that
[24:37] that man juel forny would
[24:41] do he is definitely not expressing the
[24:43] genes of his mom and daddy that brought
[24:45] him
[24:47] here sure he does in body form as he
[24:50] walks and talks and looks at himself in
[24:52] the mirror but God has transformed him
[24:56] right he's really only 18 or 20 years
[24:59] old so are you if you're born again all
[25:02] right but remember God created we got to
[25:04] get finished here God created so God
[25:10] fashioned man in his own image so we can
[25:14] take that word
[25:15] created it's like brother Joe and I were
[25:17] talking you have you ever done this I
[25:19] want to show you something Have you ever
[25:21] clicked on this
[25:23] here uh in some of the other ones it
[25:26] says click here to view all verses that
[25:29] use this Hebrew word have you ever done
[25:31] that before amen click them all it may
[25:35] not be the same word but it has the same
[25:37] meaning and boy it will actually open
[25:39] your eyes to uh to you know what the
[25:43] Lord has because it's in the original
[25:44] it's in the Hebrew and the and the Greek
[25:46] all right so there's the word created I
[25:49] want us to see this this expression now
[25:52] let's go to God said to be fruitful and
[25:56] multiply
[25:58] now let's go to multiply first and then
[26:00] we'll go to
[26:00] fruitful multiply means
[26:04] Roba now you say multiply means oh that
[26:06] means if you got one then you do
[26:08] something you got two and then you do
[26:10] something you got three you got
[26:16] four gene expression
[26:20] right to B become great B become many in
[26:25] other words to be CU Genesis 1 was to it
[26:29] was that be you are then
[26:33] become become much become numerous right
[26:38] to become many I love that to grow grow
[26:42] great it doesn't say it's always put
[26:44] that word great in there right so that's
[26:46] what God did he said be fruitful and
[26:48] multiply we always say oh well he and it
[26:50] is it is spiritual multipication
[26:54] but God becomes
[26:56] greater now remember it's not God
[26:58] becoming greater it's our revelation of
[27:01] God Amen becoming greater God knows he's
[27:04] great I'm sorry I mean God does he knows
[27:06] he's great he's the only one there's
[27:08] nobody besides him he's jealous he
[27:11] said that's God you know what the reason
[27:15] we are what we are is because God's what
[27:16] he
[27:17] is
[27:19] right now take out all the sin and look
[27:22] what you got a pretty picture all right
[27:25] we just say well we're not like God
[27:27] we're
[27:29] ERS to be like Jesus right to be like
[27:33] Jesus become great right become many
[27:37] become numerous all right so look at
[27:39] that word now let's go to
[27:41] fruitful or actually we can go to
[27:43] replenish if you want to we can go to
[27:46] replenish all right the word it said
[27:49] multiply and replenish everybody wants
[27:52] to say well what does replenish
[27:56] mean fill
[27:58] right
[28:00] you multiply and replenish the Earth
[28:04] what fill it up with who you no him
[28:08] right fullness
[28:11] abundance to be full be
[28:14] accomplished be ended
[28:18] right the end of us is the beginning of
[28:20] him right
[28:21] Amen to
[28:23] consecrate look at all these to be armed
[28:26] to be Sav
[28:28] Saied that's what the word replenish so
[28:31] when he says be fruitful and multiply
[28:33] and replenish the Earth doesn't just
[28:35] mean what I'm trying to say is
[28:37] everybody's in the angle we took it a
[28:39] lot of times is that it means we're
[28:42] going to repopulate the world and that's
[28:46] true Christians we're going to
[28:48] repopulate the world all right but he's
[28:50] not exactly telling us to just go
[28:53] multiply oursel he's telling us what we
[28:55] are right
[28:58] you see anything negative in any of that
[29:00] no I didn't think so all right now look
[29:02] at the last one fruitful be
[29:07] fruitful means to bear fruit
[29:10] right whose
[29:12] fruit love joy peace
[29:16] longsuffering all those things
[29:19] see Paul picks that
[29:23] up from the Old Testament
[29:26] amen didn't Paul read the Old Testament
[29:29] and wrote the new out of it God give him
[29:31] a revelation of what he was talking
[29:32] about Paul read Genesis 1:26 just like
[29:35] we're reading it tonight right but he
[29:38] read it in the
[29:39] Hebrew and man he's telling us say look
[29:42] this this man is bear fruit be
[29:45] fruitful to cause to bear fruit to make
[29:48] fruitful to show fruitfulness right so
[29:51] there are some of the characteristics of
[29:54] this Genesis 1 26 and 27
[29:58] man and it's it's wonderful to look back
[30:01] do that go click on these words if
[30:03] they're underlined in your in your folio
[30:06] views if they're underlined you there's
[30:08] a meaning behind it so you just click on
[30:09] it and it'll show you the meaning and
[30:11] it'll take you to other to other links
[30:14] are other words
[30:16] so God said be fruitful multiply and
[30:19] replenish the Earth all right now who
[30:21] did he give this quality to first he
[30:25] gave it to Adam right right he give this
[30:28] quality to Adam
[30:30] first and then Adam was supposed to
[30:34] take what God give
[30:36] him under
[30:39] condition remember it was a conditional
[30:42] it was a conditional Covenant right
[30:44] Abraham had the unconditional Covenant
[30:47] actually Genesis 3:15 is an
[30:48] unconditional Covenant I'll do it but
[30:51] before that he said if you'll eat of
[30:53] this cuz see it says here it
[30:55] says Genesis 2 verse 16 you don't have
[30:59] to put it up there the Lord God
[31:00] commanded the man saying of every tree
[31:03] of the garden thou mayest
[31:06] freely eat right
[31:09] but just one tree not two
[31:12] right exactly you see
[31:15] that but of the tree of knowledge of
[31:18] Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it
[31:19] now he didn't say nothing about the tree
[31:20] of life
[31:23] right did he didn't say you couldn't eat
[31:25] from that they couldn't eat from after
[31:27] they had already eat from the Tree of
[31:29] knowledge of Good and Evil right all
[31:32] right so Adam here we go with Adam and I
[31:35] want to read you some quotes because
[31:37] Adam did what God
[31:39] Said up to a point and when that uncond
[31:43] when that conditional Covenant was
[31:45] broken Adam broke
[31:47] it exactly Adam broke it all right Eve
[31:51] didn't know what she was doing Adam knew
[31:53] full well right he was selling us out
[31:56] when he took Eve but you got to see that
[31:59] Genesis 1 there's another DNA attribute
[32:02] of God is that he wasn't going to let
[32:05] that wife die right just like he's not
[32:08] going to let the bride die right same
[32:10] thing all right but now he could
[32:11] literally look at Eve and go that is
[32:13] Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone I
[32:17] mean dick Gail's been married for 50 58
[32:20] years and youd ask you 58 years 58 years
[32:26] now there one and listen in God's eyes
[32:29] they're one right but now they're
[32:31] definitely not one come from the same
[32:34] body you understand that but Adam and
[32:36] Eve literally were one
[32:39] right when he said bone of my bone and
[32:41] Flesh of My Flesh he wasn't telling a
[32:43] lie she was literally his DNA made
[32:47] manifest right amen right so he
[32:52] couldn't he wasn't going to
[32:55] let her die right but now
[32:59] listen as we've said it before cuz we're
[33:01] going to read these quotes but
[33:04] remember
[33:07] Adam was not I don't know how to say
[33:10] this he wasn't a SP a sperm
[33:13] donor
[33:15] yeah everybody's preaching that he
[33:18] planted his seed in Eve to save her
[33:20] can't do that right literal seed has
[33:24] nothing to do with God right
[33:28] nothing he permitted all this to happen
[33:31] to get you here listen there's no other
[33:35] way he could get you
[33:37] here that's what we'll talk about in
[33:39] just a minute according to God's plan
[33:40] the only way you could get here after
[33:42] the fall was to a a woman and a man
[33:45] right cuz remember right by man you live
[33:50] brother Brown said by man you live by a
[33:51] woman you die right right exactly but
[33:54] now remember you can't haul that all
[33:56] over and say well Adam well no the Bible
[33:57] says in Adam all die but Adam was of the
[33:59] earthy man right Jesus Christ was not
[34:04] like
[34:05] thaten he was born a baby all right but
[34:09] Adam watch I want you to watch this let
[34:11] me read this quote and then we'll we'll
[34:13] kind of look at Adam's I was thinking
[34:15] about this today and it really struck me
[34:18] and and and I hope it blesses your heart
[34:19] because it really blessed mine if it
[34:21] doesn't bless yours it bless mine anyway
[34:23] I've already been blessed I'm just
[34:24] giving you my blessing right all right
[34:27] so in the Messiah 1961 brother Bram says
[34:30] now I'm going to read the whole quote
[34:32] all right so we can get the essence of
[34:34] what he's talking about now Isaiah 9:6
[34:36] we just won't read it but he was to be
[34:38] the Everlasting father the Mighty
[34:42] God now I want you to think in your mind
[34:45] while we're reading this quote about Gan
[34:46] expression think about this all right
[34:49] the
[34:50] expression what was given to Adam to
[34:52] express all right
[34:55] listen God made man Genesis 126 it shows
[34:58] if you put in that scripture down
[34:59] Genesis 126 it shows that God made man
[35:03] to be a God to begin
[35:06] with not a big G right a little G
[35:10] exactly there's only one big G amen
[35:13] right
[35:14] right man was made to be a god a Lesser
[35:18] God right he was made in the image and
[35:21] likeness of God he had hands like God he
[35:24] had feet like God eyes ears and
[35:27] intelligence now he's talking about the
[35:29] Genesis 1 126
[35:32] man that is the intelligence of God
[35:35] right that is the mind of Christ Paul's
[35:38] talking about okay you see how all this
[35:41] is this Genesis 1 that's why I love this
[35:43] scripture it just to me it just unfolds
[35:45] everything the whole plan that God had
[35:48] he had a group of people sure that was
[35:50] predestined to make it Destiny was
[35:54] determined before the foundation of the
[35:55] world but not that he put you in this
[35:58] glass and said oh I'm going to take you
[36:00] out no you had a choice right and him
[36:04] knowing that choice could have this all
[36:06] waiting for you right when you got here
[36:09] what a great God what a greater thing to
[36:11] know that I was lost I was headed in the
[36:14] wrong direction I was telling somebody
[36:16] this the other day I I was telling them
[36:18] up in in U at brother
[36:21] Duchess let me just ask you this just
[36:23] stop right here just a
[36:24] second what would it be what greater
[36:27] Brother Gary would it be that if God
[36:30] came down when you were a baby and gave
[36:32] you eternal life and your life was just
[36:34] going to be that way and that's just the
[36:35] way it was going to be and then I'm
[36:36] going to take you um when you die I'm
[36:39] going to take your soul to heaven and
[36:40] you're going to live with me eternally
[36:43] or
[36:45] know that you were
[36:47] lost born in sin shapen in iniquity have
[36:51] all these problems troubles and trials
[36:53] and
[36:55] tribulations and God kn on your
[36:59] door right and you accepted it Glory
[37:04] then after that you had nothing to do
[37:06] with it
[37:07] absolutely I know the quotes but what
[37:10] greater you take savior away from him
[37:13] you take all these other attributes away
[37:15] from him if he just put you in a tube
[37:17] and pulled you through and said you're
[37:19] mine and you're going to be it and
[37:21] that's just the way it's going to
[37:22] be what greater for somebody to find me
[37:28] lost than for me to be sitting at home I
[37:31] know where I'm at when I'm at home but
[37:33] what about when I'm lost somewhere and
[37:35] somebody finds you oh what a great God
[37:38] I'm I'm telling you people take away
[37:40] from from the very essence of the they
[37:42] think they they think they got these
[37:44] quotes and you know what I'm telling you
[37:46] that's before
[37:47] 65
[37:52] yeah pretty good Aaron wasn't it that's
[37:54] before 65 you you hear false Doctrine
[37:57] that's pr65 that's not after 65 all
[38:03] right praise
[38:05] God do you know what he gave you a
[38:08] five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of
[38:10] the Saints not a onefold a five amen all
[38:14] right this was one man bringing us a
[38:16] message sure but it wasn't this man
[38:19] bringing us the message right it was
[38:21] that same one from that Genesis one man
[38:25] right look at for his kids right I was
[38:29] lost sure he knew I was going to be
[38:31] saved sure eternal life always was sure
[38:34] this gen we'll talk about in just a
[38:36] minute the the characteristics of this
[38:38] Genesis one man is just
[38:40] awesome awesome cuz they never did
[38:43] anything wrong right not even a speck
[38:48] right let's finish this God he had feet
[38:53] like God eyes ears and intelligence like
[38:55] God right
[38:57] his whole
[38:59] fiber H so that goes back to the Genesis
[39:02] 1 126 man that goes back to the gene
[39:04] expression fiber every fiber of your
[39:08] being right all right because he was a
[39:11] Son of God and Jesus referred to him as
[39:13] God right Jesus said how can you condemn
[39:15] me saying I'm the Son of God isn't it
[39:17] written on your law that you're Gods
[39:19] right they must have had a brain lapse
[39:22] or something cuz I'm sure they read that
[39:23] a million times you're gods you're
[39:27] gods and if they call those Gods who the
[39:30] word of God come to how can you condemn
[39:33] me when I say I'm the Son of God he was
[39:35] referring to the prophets the anointed
[39:37] ones lesser anointed Jesus was so
[39:40] anointed that he was more than a prophet
[39:43] Jesus was so anointed till he was the
[39:45] fullness of the godhead bodily he was
[39:48] God the prophets had the same kind of
[39:51] anointing only in a lesser condition
[39:55] right and it was just an anointing right
[39:59] it wasn't an indwelling right it wasn't
[40:02] a filling right it was
[40:07] anointing you want to just be plain
[40:09] Isaiah wasn't part of Genesis
[40:14] 126
[40:16] nope Genesis 126 is God's kids by the
[40:19] new birth Amen period
[40:22] Glory Genesis 126 is his children by the
[40:25] new birth no other way foolish virgin is
[40:27] not in Genesis 126 when God made this
[40:30] man in His image he made him just like
[40:31] his glory just like hisself yes sir we
[40:36] act the way we do amen and in Genesis
[40:39] 1:26 when God made man he made him a God
[40:41] because he gave him a Dominion he had
[40:44] rulership he had power over the birds of
[40:46] the air the cattle the wind the waves
[40:48] fishes of the sea everything he had
[40:50] dominion over everything he was a ruler
[40:54] right anointed a ruler because he was in
[40:56] the likeness in the image of God with an
[41:00] Earthly Dominion right that's why the
[41:03] Bible says the Earth is groaning crying
[41:05] waiting for the manifestation of the
[41:07] sons of God Amen the world is waiting
[41:09] for the man to come back into his right
[41:12] estate
[41:14] glory
[41:17] amen now he has made in the image of
[41:19] likeness of God that makes his when God
[41:22] made him God gave him some of his spirit
[41:27] part of his life and he's in the
[41:30] likeness and the image of God right
[41:33] therefore like here in the man in his
[41:35] natural condition the way we are
[41:37] now you can see that he's much more than
[41:40] an animal as they try to say we are
[41:43] because man in his Fallen estate yet
[41:45] being a fallen Son of God he still can
[41:49] better
[41:50] himself he has an intelligence he builds
[41:52] himself a better house in living
[41:53] conditions all right let's go to number
[41:55] two excuse me
[41:57] fundamental foundations of Faith 1955
[41:59] all right man was made as a secondary
[42:02] God on Earth he was given the power to
[42:05] control all
[42:07] things you know I told somebody the
[42:08] other day everybody thinks we're in the
[42:09] Millennium you know we got these people
[42:11] that that thinks we're in the Millennium
[42:12] you know what I've always said let's
[42:13] take him to the zoo we'll find
[42:15] out but you know what I know for a fact
[42:18] because we were down looking for a place
[42:19] to put a deer stand the other day and I
[42:21] thought buddy if that tree was right
[42:22] over
[42:25] there yeah if I could just get that tree
[42:28] to go right brother D how many times
[42:30] have we looked around and go I wish that
[42:32] tree was right over here well you know
[42:33] what if we was in the Millennium that
[42:34] tree would have been over there all
[42:37] right you say well that's too much well
[42:40] listen we're going to get into Adam just
[42:41] for a few minutes and then will quit
[42:42] because Adam had full control of this
[42:46] Earth full control it said every
[42:49] creature
[42:52] right cuz we're going to read it right
[42:54] here man was made as a second God on
[42:56] Earth he was given the power to control
[42:58] all things all elements of the earth
[43:01] that was Adam Adam was given these great
[43:04] Powers but then the power that he was
[43:06] given to make himself is where he fell
[43:09] all right and Adam could speak to the
[43:11] wind and it would stop he could speak to
[43:13] the trees and they would obey him he
[43:15] could speak to the wildlife it would
[43:17] obey him he could speak to the waters
[43:19] every what it is everything obeyed
[43:23] Adam now that is the beginning of man
[43:27] that's what God gave him power
[43:31] over everything on earth now though the
[43:34] fall he lost that power then he becomes
[43:38] unconscious of the fact
[43:42] yeah exactly see if we were if it had
[43:45] not been a fall Adam would have brought
[43:46] us forth and we would have a had a
[43:48] conscience of what we
[43:51] were but being the way we are brother
[43:54] Brown I read you the quote the last time
[43:56] preach that part was
[43:58] blackened that part was blackened away
[44:00] from us all
[44:02] right that he becomes unconscious of the
[44:05] fact after losing his relationship and
[44:08] friendship fellowship with the father
[44:10] then he lost that and all of his great
[44:12] channels became clogged up and he
[44:14] couldn't get through now look and what
[44:17] Adam was in
[44:19] God Christ has redeemed us back to that
[44:23] amen right God has redeemed us back to
[44:28] that
[44:30] right
[44:31] amen Christ come as a redeemer no in
[44:34] what he lost in the fall Christ come as
[44:36] a redeemer did you ever stop to think
[44:39] what Christ redeemed us
[44:42] for he gave us etern everlasting life
[44:45] right he brought us back to the Eternal
[44:48] fellowship and relationship to God to be
[44:51] his sons and daughters again to restore
[44:53] back all that Adam lost in the fall
[44:57] exactly he didn't say some right he said
[45:01] all glory all right now
[45:04] look now let's look for a second we know
[45:07] that Adam before the fall what he had
[45:09] control over we're not going to go
[45:10] through that again had control over
[45:12] everything in other words God was one of
[45:15] the greatest
[45:17] CEOs in the
[45:20] world he said Adam you my right-hand man
[45:24] down here on Earth I'm going to take
[45:26] care of what goes in heaven goes on in
[45:28] heaven you take care of what goes on on
[45:31] Earth and he didn't come down every day
[45:33] and say Adam now you are you are you
[45:35] watching no he
[45:37] knew that Adam was equipped for the job
[45:40] now knowing they would fall knowing that
[45:42] would happen but watch
[45:47] because if you'll reading long enough in
[45:50] the in the in the message I'm I'm not
[45:51] read any more quote so I'm just going to
[45:53] read another scripture in First
[45:54] Corinthians but not right this second
[45:56] but if you'll look that's what I was
[45:58] thinking about
[45:59] today everybody thinks and I'm telling
[46:01] you everybody thinks that when when Adam
[46:04] was formed and God breathed into his
[46:07] nostrils that that was his eternal
[46:10] life now that's not true daddy read the
[46:13] quotes the other day not this na natural
[46:17] he said life he said because remember
[46:20] you say well well I have a question
[46:22] about that
[46:23] too well Adam was made a human man
[46:27] right right and then God put that
[46:30] Genesis 1:26 in that man amen
[46:35] Adam all right let's prove
[46:38] it today I got the proof let's prove it
[46:44] now if
[46:47] Adam was born not born but came into the
[46:51] World created with eternal
[46:54] life he could have had had the quality
[46:56] could have had you hear me the quality
[46:58] of a
[46:59] redeemer cuz he'd be the Big G
[47:02] yeah Adam's problem was he was the
[47:05] little G right the Redeemer attribute
[47:08] was not in Adam
[47:13] right the Savior attribute was not an
[47:17] Adam right right if so he could have
[47:21] saved right he didn't save Eve he
[47:25] protected her right God honored
[47:29] Adam just like God honored Abraham right
[47:32] exactly brother BR said God would have
[47:33] killed Sarah right but he had to go
[47:35] through Abraham you know what God would
[47:37] have killed Eve right but he had to go
[47:39] through Adam right Adam still had that
[47:42] God quality amen that's right yes sir
[47:46] right even in Fallen condition we got a
[47:48] god quality amen all right you know I
[47:51] was we were talking about the other day
[47:53] everybody says boy you had that you know
[47:54] everybody said boy you had that seed in
[47:56] there and that was the Deep calling to
[47:57] the deep and that was that eternal life
[47:59] calling to well brother bandam said
[48:02] everybody had the ability to worship God
[48:06] right brother
[48:08] everybody I've got a quote back there in
[48:10] the back that says every man is a
[48:12] creation of God and has a longing to
[48:15] serve God Amen you just have the choice
[48:18] whether to let the god do it or let the
[48:22] worldly God do it there's your choice so
[48:26] you do have a deep call everybody
[48:28] does listen folks for God to be just
[48:32] listen on the internet wherever you are
[48:33] if if somebody tells you that you've got
[48:35] eternal life when you was a baby they're
[48:37] a
[48:38] liar they're a liar
[48:42] right when are we going to say it right
[48:45] that's a
[48:47] lie but there was a day that I received
[48:50] that eternal life I wasn't born with it
[48:55] right
[48:56] but there was a longing look for God to
[48:58] be just he had to put that longing in
[49:01] every seven billion people that's alive
[49:03] right now on Earth there's a longing to
[49:05] serve
[49:06] God if not he cannot put you at judgment
[49:11] and say you go to hell right that's
[49:13] right to be just that's the first thing
[49:16] it came to my mind when I heard that
[49:18] being preached the first I said God you
[49:20] you said you're a just God and a and he
[49:23] is the just God he's not just just like
[49:25] we're just in our court system cuzz we
[49:27] can fail he's just Glory he knows those
[49:31] who he's Justified he's already
[49:33] glorified that's cuz when he justifies
[49:35] something it's all the way through but
[49:37] see to be a just God he can't say well
[49:40] you know Mark walks up to the white
[49:42] Throne judgment and he says well God you
[49:44] didn't you didn't call
[49:47] me and God said no I didn't you're going
[49:49] to hell well now look is that
[49:53] just no it's just for every a person to
[49:56] walk up and God said I called you when
[49:59] you were 12 14 25 85
[50:03] 95 I called you right here don't you
[50:06] remember that time I
[50:08] called and you took the god of the
[50:11] world over me there's the choice I told
[50:15] him before brother bham never took the
[50:17] words choice and free moral agency out
[50:19] of his sermons never he always preached
[50:21] free choice free moral agency Free Will
[50:24] right cuz then you can walk up and if
[50:26] you said hey you know God you you didn't
[50:29] ever call me he said yeah and you know
[50:31] what that'll come back to your mind
[50:32] right exactly that makes him just that
[50:35] makes him he they know that they're
[50:37] judged right there so you keep that in
[50:40] your mind God is a just God right
[50:45] everybody has an opportunity even Cain
[50:48] the man that come from the the U act
[50:52] between a woman and a and a
[50:54] animal
[50:57] had a choice right my if he
[51:01] did we're okay right cuz that's the
[51:04] brother Brown said that's the epitome of
[51:06] evil Cain was the epitome of evil right
[51:10] why he made a
[51:11] choice he had a longing to serve God you
[51:14] know why he made sacrifices oh
[51:17] yeah didn't he went to church every
[51:20] Sunday
[51:24] right hey probably might have missed a
[51:26] few taking care of his
[51:30] sheep the devil never misses when you're
[51:32] not g when you're not
[51:36] here you love the
[51:38] Lord but here's Adam's dilemma Adam's
[51:42] dilemma was like I said now you you can
[51:44] take and you can see well now why didn't
[51:46] Adam well he didn't have that attribute
[51:48] he didn't have an attribute of healer of
[51:50] Savior Adam couldn't heal
[51:53] anybody God proved he was a Healer by
[51:56] closing up the wound Amen in his own
[52:00] side right
[52:02] amen and remember brother Brown said
[52:05] Adam tried to go out and get Eve and
[52:07] bring her back and what happened he
[52:08] couldn't right cuz he was Adam right 1
[52:14] Corinthians 15:45 let's turn and read
[52:22] that so as it is written the first first
[52:25] man Adam was made a living Soul the last
[52:28] Adam was made a quickening spirit all
[52:30] right how be it that was not first which
[52:32] is
[52:34] spiritual he was Earthly then the
[52:37] spiritual was put into him right but
[52:39] that which is natural and afterward that
[52:41] which is spiritual so you come here
[52:44] natural then if you're born again you
[52:47] get the spiritual right pretty
[52:49] self-explanatory the first man is of the
[52:51] earth earthy the second man is the Lord
[52:54] From Heaven amen all right Jesus said
[52:56] you must be born from above I cannot
[52:58] understand the first sermon Jesus
[52:59] preached you must be born again and
[53:00] people want to say you already got he
[53:02] should have like Daddy said he should
[53:03] have talk to Nicodemus said Nicodemus
[53:05] all you got to do is believe that I'm
[53:06] I'm the U you know the great one I'm the
[53:09] Christ you all you got to do is believe
[53:10] that no he didn't tell him that you know
[53:13] what Nicodemus had a knowledge that he
[53:15] was something
[53:17] special right or he wouldn't have come
[53:20] to him like I said he was he was risking
[53:22] his life from talking to that man but he
[53:25] wanted to know what was going on with
[53:27] this man that was different but the
[53:28] second man is the Lord From Heaven as is
[53:31] the earthy such are they also that are
[53:35] earthy
[53:36] human and as is the Heavenly such are
[53:40] they also that are Heavenly as we have
[53:43] been born the image of the earthy what
[53:46] I'm looking at now right we shall also
[53:51] bear the
[53:54] image
[53:55] God created us in his what image so
[53:58] we're right back to Genesis 1 we also
[54:01] shall bear the
[54:02] image of the Heavenly now this I say
[54:05] Brethren that flesh and blood cannot
[54:08] inherit the kingdom of God neither does
[54:10] corruption inherit incorruption all
[54:14] right so in other words we're not going
[54:16] to take listen now we're not going to
[54:19] take the same body listen you know how
[54:24] we believe it here
[54:25] but this body has to be
[54:29] changed but it won't lose its
[54:33] characteristics exactly but it's going
[54:35] to be
[54:36] changed to match what's inside amen cuz
[54:40] we are definitely over 20 most of
[54:43] us so we're heading back in that
[54:45] direction right so this is flesh and
[54:47] blood this is not going to inherit the
[54:48] Kingdom what is our inheritance our
[54:50] inheritance is Genesis 1 126 amen right
[54:53] that's our inheritance
[54:56] and Jesus we Adam lost it listen how
[54:59] simple this is Adam lost it right how
[55:02] simple Adam lost it he lost the ability
[55:06] to bring a Son of God into the Earth
[55:09] right remember brother Bram said what
[55:12] happened in the garden was is Satan
[55:14] stopped a Son of God from being
[55:16] born cuz when Eve's womb was polluted
[55:20] remember when Eve's womb was polluted
[55:22] God said I can't come through that no
[55:24] more
[55:26] all right so in other words Adam
[55:29] couldn't
[55:32] produce he produced his own DNA he
[55:35] produced his own gene expression in Abel
[55:37] and Seth and all down the line in the
[55:39] natural genetics but he couldn't produce
[55:42] another spiritual
[55:43] person amen everybody understand what
[55:46] I'm saying he couldn't produce another
[55:49] born again or another Genesis 126
[55:54] man CU brother Ram said Adam lost the
[55:58] book there's Theo see that's why you
[56:01] when you say book I go back to Genesis 1
[56:03] 126 right that's the Lamb's Book of Life
[56:07] amen that's why it was written before
[56:09] the foundation of the world
[56:12] exactly that's my
[56:13] inheritance and Adam stopped me from
[56:17] coming the way I should have come right
[56:19] but what happened to the second
[56:21] Adam he was the Lord from Glory right he
[56:25] was able to produce what he
[56:28] said because remember when Jesus Christ
[56:32] was born in that manger a little
[56:36] baby God
[56:39] Almighty entered that
[56:43] body okay and all the attributes of
[56:48] God entered that body
[56:52] right that didn't do away with God right
[56:55] you understand what I'm saying do away
[56:56] with God but if he was the fullness of
[56:58] the godhead bodily what was inside of
[57:00] Jesus
[57:01] right Genesis 1
[57:04] 26 and
[57:08] 27 that's why he wasn't just called
[57:10] Jesus he was called Jesus Christ there
[57:15] was many Jesus's people millions of them
[57:18] brother R said I know millions of
[57:20] jesuses
[57:22] jesuses but there was only one
[57:25] Jesus Christ GL see Jesus Christ created
[57:29] all things
[57:31] amen right exactly that's why that this
[57:34] Genesis 126 man that's why Adam he
[57:37] portrayed Christ but he wasn't Christ
[57:42] right if he was Christ he could have
[57:44] saved Eve is that okay so that so that
[57:47] makes it to where Adam is a is a
[57:50] person and then just like me and you
[57:53] we're a person and then that had eternal
[57:55] life when we accept it now remember Adam
[57:57] didn't have a choice he just he got it
[57:59] right but see God was going to get God
[58:01] had already told him what to do so he
[58:04] couldn't back off of Adam he told him
[58:06] what to
[58:08] do replenish the Earth subdue it do all
[58:11] these things he told them before they
[58:12] even got in flesh so he'd already told
[58:15] them what he wanted them to do and God
[58:17] can't change his
[58:19] mind right but it was messed up because
[58:23] of Adam
[58:25] his dilemma was is he wasn't the
[58:29] Christ now he portrayed Christ you
[58:31] understand what I mean brother Brown
[58:32] never said he said he portrayed Christ
[58:35] when he took Eve right he portrayed
[58:37] Christ what he showed a characteristic
[58:40] that's why in the Old Testament you can
[58:42] see the characteristics of God but
[58:44] that's not God in human flesh
[58:48] right one more
[58:50] time amen means so be it
[58:53] amen that's why in the Old Testament you
[58:57] couldn't have any Genesis 1 126 and 27
[59:01] people right because
[59:05] Adam from Adam on down he couldn't
[59:09] produce but now watch now when the great
[59:12] one
[59:13] come Jesus Christ came with that Genesis
[59:17] 126 and 27 in him amen cuz brother Brown
[59:21] said if if I'm in Christ I walk the
[59:23] shores of Galilee
[59:25] right what in that soul of that
[59:28] individual called Jesus
[59:31] Christ he had me in him right just like
[59:34] my father had him had me in him right I
[59:38] wasn't in my daddy when I was born right
[59:41] oh I'm sorry my daddy wasn't in me when
[59:43] I was born I was in my I come from my
[59:47] father okay I had to be birthed right to
[59:51] get here everybody understand what I'm
[59:52] talking about you couldn't find like I
[59:54] was telling them up there you you
[59:55] couldn't find and like Daddy said they
[59:57] did all these great things with the
[59:59] circles and all this stuff you couldn't
[1:00:01] find me as a as me you looking at me
[1:00:04] right now right you couldn't find me and
[1:00:06] my daddy right there's no way you can
[1:00:10] say that cell was way Dale and here it
[1:00:13] comes and his s daddy you know he eats
[1:00:14] and uh you know the sperm comes from
[1:00:17] blood and it's highly congealed blood
[1:00:19] and then you understand what I'm
[1:00:22] saying my name wasn't written on one of
[1:00:25] those little germs
[1:00:29] right I'm trying to be carnal but I'm
[1:00:31] trying to make an illustration here but
[1:00:33] I but when I was developed or when I was
[1:00:38] born what
[1:00:40] happened I became a gene expression
[1:00:43] right of my father amen so in his
[1:00:46] genetic makeup I was
[1:00:49] there exactly so in Jesus Christ in his
[1:00:55] genetic makeup Brother Gary when he said
[1:00:58] let us create man or in other words let
[1:01:00] us fashion or in other words let us
[1:01:04] develop not create Brother Richard as
[1:01:07] nothing and then no you always was if
[1:01:10] that Genesis 126 was with God way before
[1:01:13] amen there was ever a world that's but
[1:01:16] remember what's happening now and this
[1:01:20] struck me the other day what's happening
[1:01:21] now brother B always says you don't
[1:01:23] remember
[1:01:25] you know when I was born the only thing
[1:01:26] I remember I was telling Jacob today I
[1:01:29] remember the first thing I remember as a
[1:01:31] child was when we were building the
[1:01:33] house up on the hill there in Gillsville
[1:01:35] which means that was
[1:01:36] 1964 65 I was 5 years old there was a
[1:01:42] it's funny how things stick in your mind
[1:01:43] but there was um a man putting up
[1:01:45] sheetrock and at that time there was no
[1:01:48] there was no of none of those razor
[1:01:50] blade knives everybody remember the old
[1:01:52] Hulk Bell yeah M that they use old Hal
[1:01:55] halt Bill and they kept this sharpen and
[1:01:56] that's what they cut the that's what
[1:01:57] they cut the sheetrock with he had it
[1:01:59] stuck in his back pocket Brother Martin
[1:02:00] he was bent down like this doing
[1:02:02] something well it was sticking out just
[1:02:03] like that I ran by and slid a big old
[1:02:06] place in my leg and it's still numb now
[1:02:09] good thing didn't hit me in the
[1:02:12] head be numb to this day don't say
[1:02:15] nothing ter nothing at all but you know
[1:02:18] I remember that yeah because it was a
[1:02:20] traumatic time in my life you know I
[1:02:22] mean it that hurt m
[1:02:24] but see remember before that I don't you
[1:02:26] know Jim's always saying that her sister
[1:02:30] remembers when she was in the womb cuz
[1:02:32] she's got this extravagant you know
[1:02:35] memory or let's say imagination let's
[1:02:37] don't say memory let's say imagination
[1:02:39] but remember brother B said that was
[1:02:41] blackened from us that we don't so we
[1:02:43] don't remember and we weren't as people
[1:02:45] before anything right but remember when
[1:02:49] we become a a baby we become a living
[1:02:52] Soul amen God can only give you a soul
[1:02:56] Satan can't give you a soul so God gives
[1:02:59] you a permitted life MH it's permitted
[1:03:02] by God see then you now you're on you're
[1:03:05] equal you've got a
[1:03:08] choice cuz inside that me or inside that
[1:03:11] you there was an ability to serve God
[1:03:14] yeah that's right an ability cuz we were
[1:03:16] all Made In His Image but not created
[1:03:20] formed like this in Genesis 1 you got it
[1:03:23] right
[1:03:24] when we receive that at our new birth we
[1:03:27] become That Glory but now God knows that
[1:03:30] true he knows exactly you're going to
[1:03:32] come to that and he could write your
[1:03:33] name in the book but Daddy couldn't
[1:03:35] write my name in the book of The Family
[1:03:38] Bible until I became who I you know a
[1:03:42] baby right but God what I'm trying to
[1:03:45] say is you couldn't find me and Daddy
[1:03:47] well you couldn't find me in
[1:03:53] God
[1:03:56] but if I'm born again
[1:04:00] tonight whatever attribute that Genesis
[1:04:03] 126
[1:04:04] was is in me right it's like I me and
[1:04:08] dad was talking the other day coming
[1:04:09] home from from hunting now I can look
[1:04:14] back see now I my eyes been opened right
[1:04:17] I can look back and see yes I was back
[1:04:21] there in my father in an
[1:04:24] attribute that he wanted and was going
[1:04:27] to express amen he wasn't half Hazard
[1:04:30] see mom and dad didn't know how many
[1:04:31] this going to have but God knew exactly
[1:04:34] how many children he's going to have but
[1:04:37] now remember once the once Jesus came
[1:04:40] and we'll get finished right here once
[1:04:42] Jesus
[1:04:43] came I preached 45 minutes at brother
[1:04:45] Dutch's Church the other day 45
[1:04:49] minutes that's from start to finish
[1:04:52] somebody said praise the Lord
[1:04:55] and he sent April must have sent him a
[1:04:57] text afterwards cuz he text me back and
[1:04:59] he said are you trying to take over my
[1:05:02] church he said pastors only preached 45
[1:05:05] minutes in this church so I preached an
[1:05:07] hour and a half the second service yeah
[1:05:10] I text him back I said I don't want your
[1:05:11] church I'm proving
[1:05:14] it
[1:05:16] but hopefully we'll get a lot said here
[1:05:19] I just lost my whole thought there and I
[1:05:21] forgot what I was talking
[1:05:22] about but we come to this Genesis 126
[1:05:25] and 27 man that is an attribute of God
[1:05:30] right so an attribute of God is God made
[1:05:33] manifest in another form amen okay right
[1:05:37] so now as we are that oh I got it back
[1:05:41] now we can look
[1:05:42] back because we have the mind of Christ
[1:05:45] well where was the mind of Christ
[1:05:49] right where was it it was in daddy right
[1:05:55] yeah and then Paul says we must have
[1:05:59] it in order to understand where we came
[1:06:02] from right now that I understand brother
[1:06:05] Chris where I did come from I don't flip
[1:06:07] out when the when the Bible says in Job
[1:06:09] that that the sons of God shouted for
[1:06:11] joy and all these things what we were an
[1:06:14] attribute we weren't people but you know
[1:06:16] what I can look back today and I can
[1:06:18] look at that and say
[1:06:20] hey God was shouting right
[1:06:24] because he saw me and
[1:06:28] you that's why he was
[1:06:30] shouting he saw me and you yeah is that
[1:06:34] okay right because let me tell you
[1:06:36] something God had one purpose when he
[1:06:39] came on Earth was to get that Genesis
[1:06:41] 126 and 27 back on the Earth again
[1:06:45] right exactly right you said well no he
[1:06:49] was H healing and all that's fine
[1:06:52] Brother BR said that's temporary right
[1:06:54] mhm you can be healed today and die the
[1:06:55] same thing you can be healed by God
[1:06:57] today of cancer and die of cancer
[1:06:59] tomorrow a that what he said because of
[1:07:01] this human element got it but if you
[1:07:03] ever save a soul get a soul saved that's
[1:07:06] it he said a million
[1:07:09] worlds a million worlds I wouldn't if I
[1:07:12] could know that that I could that I
[1:07:14] could sell you know all of this world to
[1:07:18] have my kill children saved I do it do
[1:07:22] it in heartbeat wouldn't even think a
[1:07:23] thing about it if I had to sell
[1:07:25] everything on
[1:07:27] but Mama prove that she's prayed for us
[1:07:31] she you know laid before God and cried
[1:07:34] and begged for us and plead that that
[1:07:37] don't it does do it good you understand
[1:07:40] but until my time's
[1:07:44] ready you it's I mean you can we try to
[1:07:47] save our kids is what I'm trying to say
[1:07:49] you can't save your children God's got
[1:07:52] to save them but he does hear the
[1:07:54] fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:07:55] man why you know why he knew you were
[1:07:58] going to pray that prayer to start with
[1:08:01] exactly and I want to know and I know I
[1:08:04] got Godly Parents but brother Brown said
[1:08:06] some old grandma four
[1:08:08] generations back right you know none of
[1:08:11] your none some of you come maybe I
[1:08:13] brother Chris maybe some of your parents
[1:08:14] never were Christians you say why'd God
[1:08:17] drop down and you know why am I here I I
[1:08:21] didn't have nothing my parents I had no
[1:08:23] up bringing of Christianity some old
[1:08:26] grandma four generations back brother
[1:08:28] Brown said got on her knees and and
[1:08:31] fervently said God save all my children
[1:08:35] my grandchildren and my great
[1:08:37] grandchildren and God heard that
[1:08:40] prayer you know why cuz she had the mind
[1:08:43] of God she was a Christian woman God had
[1:08:46] to
[1:08:47] react to his own self
[1:08:50] right that's right cuz when he put that
[1:08:52] Genesis 126 and 27 seven on display that
[1:08:55] was his self on
[1:08:58] display that wasn't all the people of
[1:09:00] the world right that's the people he
[1:09:02] come to get you know why cuz you and I
[1:09:05] were in
[1:09:06] him when he went to Calvary we were
[1:09:10] there
[1:09:14] amen when he went to hell
[1:09:17] right we went with him exactly cuz that
[1:09:20] Genesis 126 and 27 let's just break it
[1:09:22] down real simple that's the soul of God
[1:09:25] right amen because the soul is the real
[1:09:27] you
[1:09:29] amen and that is the real God right that
[1:09:33] Genesis 126 and 27 man is just the real
[1:09:36] God Amen that's what he
[1:09:39] wanted all this other stuff all this
[1:09:41] superficial stuff yeah sure he'll he'll
[1:09:44] have foolish virgins and he'll have this
[1:09:45] and he'll have that but he come to get
[1:09:47] that Genesis 126 man cuz you know what
[1:09:49] he already said that we were supposed to
[1:09:52] multiply replenish and subdue the Earth
[1:09:55] right in that form amen right in that
[1:09:59] form but when Adam did what he
[1:10:02] did and he couldn't save us you know why
[1:10:06] cuz you're not our brother he wasn't
[1:10:08] born like us right he was created full
[1:10:11] grown right right but you and I come as
[1:10:15] a baby Jesus came as a baby that made us
[1:10:17] join a that's why he brought us up
[1:10:19] that's why brother brandham said he said
[1:10:21] Jesus didn't come to bring us an
[1:10:22] inheritance
[1:10:26] exactly the problem was we couldn't get
[1:10:29] to it
[1:10:31] right right we couldn't get to it right
[1:10:35] it was barred we become the earthy
[1:10:39] man and we did earthy things right we
[1:10:43] couldn't get back that's what a fall
[1:10:45] means you
[1:10:47] fall but what does redeem mean bring
[1:10:50] back right amen all right so what
[1:10:53] happened was that when Jesus came he had
[1:10:56] that in
[1:10:58] him still no way to get it out sister
[1:11:01] Maggie while he was alive right CU he
[1:11:04] was the very essence of God right he was
[1:11:06] the very attributes of God love joy
[1:11:08] peace longsuffering all those things
[1:11:10] that's what we talking about the Statue
[1:11:11] of a perfect man that's
[1:11:13] God that's God Amen that's the statue of
[1:11:17] a perfect man so so what Jesus had he
[1:11:19] had all that inside of him he had what
[1:11:22] Adam lost right
[1:11:24] right right he had what Adam lost amen
[1:11:27] the book remember he was the lamb he was
[1:11:30] the Redeemer what do you see in in
[1:11:32] Revelations 5 you see a lamb taking a
[1:11:35] book right from the hands of the owner
[1:11:41] God he took it from Adam Adam couldn't
[1:11:44] do it but somebody had to be worthy
[1:11:48] amen but what was that
[1:11:51] worthiness sure it was in one single man
[1:11:55] called Jesus Christ Behold the Lamb of
[1:11:56] God that takes away the sin of the world
[1:11:58] right
[1:11:59] but here's the point what we coming
[1:12:04] to brother bro
[1:12:08] said that the seed life comes through
[1:12:10] the body
[1:12:12] right Adam's problem was he couldn't
[1:12:16] produce any spiritual seed
[1:12:18] anymore he could only produce natural
[1:12:20] seed
[1:12:21] right that's right exactly is that okay
[1:12:25] right he couldn't produce natural I mean
[1:12:26] spiritual seed anymore so it couldn't
[1:12:29] come through Adam it couldn't come
[1:12:31] through Isaiah it couldn't come
[1:12:34] through it come through what they said
[1:12:37] but it couldn't come through
[1:12:39] them but when Jesus comes on
[1:12:42] Earth the seed Galatians 3:16 that seed
[1:12:46] which is Christ was in that man amen all
[1:12:49] right everybody got that it was in that
[1:12:50] man okay the Genesis 126 had had come to
[1:12:54] Earth but it was in one man amen now he
[1:12:57] said multiply and replenish Jesus never
[1:13:00] had babies natural seed right got it so
[1:13:05] let's take that away so it had to be
[1:13:07] something on the spiritual side right
[1:13:09] cuz you had Adam was the earthy man
[1:13:11] Christ was The Lord Of Glory all right
[1:13:14] so you got Christ here with all these
[1:13:17] little sons and daughters in him right
[1:13:21] and there's no way he's not going to
[1:13:24] bring them sexually anymore cuz that's
[1:13:26] what started the brewha to start with
[1:13:29] right right so you can't you can't
[1:13:31] redeem and take it to the same thing
[1:13:33] that made it fall right you got to take
[1:13:35] it back before that multiply and
[1:13:38] replenish the Earth before they were in
[1:13:40] flesh but now we're in
[1:13:43] flesh cuz without being in flesh he
[1:13:46] can't be a savior amen nothing to save
[1:13:48] you can't save Genesis
[1:13:51] 126 exactly
[1:13:56] you
[1:13:57] can't you can't save Genesis
[1:14:03] 1:26 come on think up you
[1:14:06] can't Genesis 1 126 is eternal before
[1:14:09] the foundation of the
[1:14:11] world now if it comes into
[1:14:19] you now you can read the scripture in
[1:14:21] there in in first John where was says
[1:14:23] the seed remains in you and you cannot
[1:14:27] sin cuz Genesis 126 and 27 never sinned
[1:14:33] amen I never done it in the first place
[1:14:36] Justified we can sing at all we want to
[1:14:38] but once we realize that what we got
[1:14:40] inside of us was what was back there in
[1:14:43] Genesis
[1:14:46] 1:26 when we realize
[1:14:48] that Brad realizes who she is and what
[1:14:52] she's doing here here that man that
[1:14:55] walked up and took that book had seven
[1:14:58] horns and seven
[1:15:00] eyes he was able to spiritually
[1:15:03] reproduce
[1:15:05] himself where Adam couldn't do that
[1:15:07] anymore cuz the seed had to come through
[1:15:10] the body Jesus said a corn of wheat goes
[1:15:12] in the ground die bu alone right but if
[1:15:16] it comes up you plant one grain of corn
[1:15:20] how many grains you get thousands then
[1:15:23] you plant them and get millions they
[1:15:25] everything everything you see come from
[1:15:27] one
[1:15:29] seed right everything you see come what
[1:15:32] every blade of grass in the world came
[1:15:33] from one seed
[1:15:35] right that's it that's
[1:15:38] it that's it right goes right back to
[1:15:41] Eden again right go back to that's where
[1:15:44] it's why brother R said Satan hates
[1:15:46] Genesis and
[1:15:48] Revelations
[1:15:50] Revelations to me Revelations tells us
[1:15:53] us what happened in Genesis right
[1:15:55] exactly and Genesis is the beginning
[1:15:57] that's what Genesis means the beginning
[1:16:00] so there is your beginning right there
[1:16:02] in Genesis 126 right there at the very
[1:16:04] first of it Genesis 126 and
[1:16:09] 27 is
[1:16:13] Colossians Christ in you right the hope
[1:16:16] of glory amen on the day of Pentecost
[1:16:19] when when when God when Jesus died that
[1:16:23] eternal life came out of that
[1:16:25] body and it went to hell
[1:16:28] Amen in his mind he knew what he was
[1:16:32] doing right he had to come back
[1:16:35] resurrect pick up or pick up that body
[1:16:37] and resurrect and then more like him
[1:16:40] Bible says amen we'll see more like him
[1:16:43] that's right cuz see what how we going
[1:16:45] to see him as he is if we don't know who
[1:16:46] he is start with
[1:16:49] right I know I'm his child
[1:16:52] because I'm connected to
[1:16:54] him I live with him he he raised me but
[1:16:58] I look like him I look like Mama okay I
[1:17:02] can't deny that that's my gene
[1:17:03] expression that's what I'm telling you
[1:17:05] tonight that Genesis 126 and 27 is the
[1:17:08] gene expression of what God
[1:17:11] is cuz you're the gene expression of
[1:17:13] what your parents
[1:17:17] were so down through the church ages
[1:17:19] once 120 started in that Upper
[1:17:22] Room there was Genesis 1 right back on
[1:17:24] the Earth
[1:17:27] right there's where it started again the
[1:17:30] beginning of the creation of God right
[1:17:33] back to where brother Dale has been
[1:17:34] preaching at the beginning of at in
[1:17:36] Revelations 3:14 the beginning of the
[1:17:38] creation of God
[1:17:42] are what did we read the shaping or
[1:17:46] fashioning
[1:17:49] right 120 in the upper room started
[1:17:52] acting like
[1:17:54] Christ remember is that what they said
[1:17:56] that's why the Christians were called
[1:17:58] Christians because they what they acted
[1:17:59] like their daddy right right they acted
[1:18:02] like Christ so that's what you and I
[1:18:04] seven horns and seven eyes there's your
[1:18:07] spiritual
[1:18:08] multiplication right right and when that
[1:18:11] person that represented all of us took
[1:18:14] that
[1:18:15] book there's your
[1:18:18] Redemption redemption's over
[1:18:21] right not in 1963 three right when that
[1:18:24] Genesis 126 and 27 comes to you
[1:18:27] redemption's
[1:18:28] over when you're born again those who is
[1:18:31] Justified he's already glorified Glory
[1:18:34] that's right those who is Justified he's
[1:18:37] already carried you through your
[1:18:39] journey cuz he's with you even in you
[1:18:41] let's stand even in you to the end of
[1:18:44] the world
[1:18:46] Amen Genesis 1:26 and 27
[1:18:50] is the gene expression of God himself
[1:18:54] right right no
[1:18:56] other not we're not the devil's
[1:18:59] kids we're God's
[1:19:02] kids and don't let the devil tell you
[1:19:04] any different but what our problem is is
[1:19:07] like brother Brown said we've walked in
[1:19:09] Blackness so much so much Darkness yeah
[1:19:13] what did Satan do he just pulled wool
[1:19:14] over Eve's eyes right he tricked
[1:19:18] her just like preachers in the pull pit
[1:19:21] right they'll trick you into believing
[1:19:22] stuff
[1:19:23] but what happens is everybody goes oh
[1:19:25] that seed well you know what since I'm
[1:19:26] born again you know what happens that
[1:19:28] seed rings out when something's not
[1:19:31] right that's right now before that when
[1:19:33] I was doing something
[1:19:35] wrong that was me ringing out that right
[1:19:40] that was me ringing out that wasn't God
[1:19:41] ringing out that was me and you and our
[1:19:43] human
[1:19:44] nature that's why the Bible says
[1:19:49] changed Paul said follow me into what
[1:19:52] read
[1:19:54] genation right when you're regenerated
[1:19:57] You're reged My Generation comes from
[1:19:59] Samuel and Peggy Dale right but when I'm
[1:20:03] reged it comes from God right so
[1:20:05] there're that part of me always was
[1:20:09] eternal never had a beginning never had
[1:20:11] an end and you know what never said a
[1:20:14] bad word never had a bad thought right
[1:20:17] that's why I said you can't save Genesis
[1:20:19] 126 and 27 it always was God they don't
[1:20:22] need saving does it but us being
[1:20:26] here needed salvation right we heard
[1:20:30] from
[1:20:31] that God knowing we would want it more
[1:20:34] than the beer we were drinking or
[1:20:36] whatever we were doing put XYZ in there
[1:20:40] he knew we'd want it more so you know
[1:20:41] what he had it there amen and you know
[1:20:43] what I don't have a problem like me and
[1:20:45] dad was talking I don't have a problem
[1:20:46] with with God sending giving you an
[1:20:47] angel at your birth right cuz God knows
[1:20:52] you're coming to it you just don't know
[1:20:54] it right but he gives you an angel to
[1:20:56] lead and guide you cuz you know what
[1:20:58] you're not if you're a son and daughter
[1:21:00] of God you're not going to die to you
[1:21:01] get you birth
[1:21:03] right don't go stand on the railroad
[1:21:05] tracks and provoke it right but right
[1:21:09] you're so you're so
[1:21:13] protected cuz he's going to have his
[1:21:15] expression amen see he's not haphazard
[1:21:18] just going to have a few kids here in no
[1:21:20] he's got so many he's going to have and
[1:21:21] that's it
[1:21:23] he's going to have so many children and
[1:21:24] that's it it's your choice whether to be
[1:21:28] in that or not amen remember Genesis
[1:21:30] 1126 is predestinated determined by God
[1:21:33] and it's going to happen right by for
[1:21:37] knowledge but we have to realize that
[1:21:40] that's where we came from we heard from
[1:21:43] what our theophany which is Genesis 1:26
[1:21:46] and 27 is the theophany of God remember
[1:21:49] we put it on the board the other day
[1:21:50] that's the theophany of God right
[1:21:54] who can lay one
[1:21:56] charge to God's
[1:21:58] elect one if you can find one we're
[1:22:02] Bound for hell right but if you can find
[1:22:05] one and I'm born again God's Bound for
[1:22:07] hell right that's
