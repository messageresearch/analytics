we're going to look into the book of hebrews chapter 11. very familiar scripture when they uh when they bring it up one we'll just all bow our heads this morning we'll speak to the author before we read the scripture heavenly father we thank you for another time to be in your house lord lord to be gathered around your word father you said whether two or three would be gathered in your name you

with them touch them and we just commit all things to you bless your bride around the world well we're just so thankful we just want to say that we love you this morning in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen hebrews chapter 11 verse 30 says by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace amen god bless you this morning be seated and i titled this a true token and in joshua chapter 2 as we'll we'll get here in a minute in verse in verse 12 when rahab is speaking to the spies she says give me a true token and that's where our title comes from a token you know brother rem tells us that a token is is something that shows that affair has been paid it's a sign and the the dictionary says something token means something serving to represent or indicates some fact event feeling etc a sign a characteristic indication or mark of something it's an evidence or proof and so we want to speak about a true token and beginning here in joshua chapter 2 beginning with verse 1 says and joshua the son of nun sent out of him to men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came into a harlot's house named rahab and lodged there now brother branham says in the message perseverance i'm sorry i'm sorry why little bethlehem here and it says uh he said we find out also it became the home of the harlot rahab when israel had passed over the border line of the jordan river into palestine we are acquainted with the story of rahab the harlot hey let's picture her this morning a few minutes as a young lady a beautiful young woman who some misfortune in life had forced her in being a pagan had forced her into the life that she was living and many times people are forced into the life that they live and so you know we see things that and you know brother rem says that we don't even history tells us we don't know a lot about the life of rahab but we do know one thing about it that she was a believer and we know that you know she's a she was a gentile which was an outcast here she was one of the lowest forms in society but and and all of that she still believed what she had heard so she she had she had a something that she believed in what she had heard now one of the things i want to look at this morning we're going to go through this this chapter here in and in the book of joshua and picking up verse 2 here continuing on and it says and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came in men in hither tonight of the children of israel to watch out the country and the king of jericho sent unto rahab saying bring forth the men that are come un come to thee which are entered into thine house for they become to search out all the country and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there came men unto me but which not once they were and it came to pass about the time of the shedding of the gate when it was dark that the men went out wither the men went i will not pursue after them quickly for ye shall overtake them but she had brought them up into the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof and the and the men pursued after them the way to jordan under the fords and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out they shut the gate and before they were hit before they were laid down she came up upon up to them upon the roof now it's interesting when we look at the scripture here here here they are they they come in and joshua has sent the spies in to spy out the land and so as they come in to smile the land the first person they come to is rahab you know the scripture tells us brother brown tells us that you know god always comes to the predestinated seed and here she here they come they come to her and she hides them in the house and she and she hides them and you know she tells them that the men have gone she didn't know they were spies she said just come in but she left but in as we continue on here in the in the scripture as we begin to read we find out that in the scripture reading you know that they begin to tell her who they were and she recognizes who they are but the one thing about rahab is she testifies to what she believes what she sees and what she knows and so we see that in the scripture they begin to they begin to talk about these things and you know she realized by the situation that was going on she realized what she was under because by her own testimony as we as we'll read here in a minute you know her testimony she realized the condition that she was in but she had but she knew what she where she wanted to be what she wanted to take what to take place because when she when she begins to hear in the scripture in verse 9 she said and she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given you the land that your terror has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when you came out of egypt and what ye did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of jordan saihon and og whom ye utterly destroyed and he said and as soon as and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth beneath so when when they come in she realizes who they are and she takes them in and then she begins when they when she finds out who they are because of what she had heard faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god and but she when she heard these things then she began to tell them hey we got no you know we realized that there's no fight she realized that because of what was going to take place because of what god had done when when god had called the children of israel out of egypt when he called them out and he brand again to bring them in the way to the promised land a promise that had been promised many years before but he had promised abraham that they would come into that land and when they began to walk toward that land then you know it wasn't it wasn't going to be just an easy cakewalk that they were just gonna walk into the land but you know what god was going to prove who he was he promised to bring them into the land but you know he was going to bring him all the way and he wanted them to realize that he was the one that was doing it not them and as he began to bring them along the way then all of a sudden the kings rose up and they just said we just want to pass through the part of your land we're just trying to get to the promised land we're trying to get into canaan and they're like no you're not passing through our lane and they began to stand against them one of them actually came out to fight to resist the children of israel and you know they were they were trying to be as peaceful as they could but you know what they got into god's way because god's way was going in and when they got in the way of god's plan then guess what they were utterly destroyed and they just kept so they just kept moving forward and then when when they begin to speak of these things then when rahab begins to tell the spies listen we've heard what your god can do we've seen those things because we know now amazingly when you when you go back and look when rahabs begins to speak of this you've got to think that here they are under bondage to the greatest army to the greatest world power at the present time and here they are bound by the by egypt by the pharaoh almost i mean people worship the pharaoh as a god you got to think of what kind of of a presence this man has what kind what kind of authority this man has and yet moses goes before him and tells him let my people go he didn't have any respect why because he had respect to the word of god but when they came out and then pharaoh's like you know i'm coming after you after he tells them to leave that he's after him he come out to destroy them but the problem is is god calls one to walk a certain way but he doesn't call everybody to walk that way why because you know the way that brought them out was the way of destruction for the for the egyptian army and so here they are walking across in dry land when the red sea parted and it was you know not just some some fable or some story but it was actually a miracle of god because you know i believe i believe that that took place just as sure as i'm standing here this morning why because he's the same yesterday today and forever if god's ever done anything then he'll always do the same thing and he's still capable this morning of bringing whatever you have need he can still work miracles the problem is he's looking for somebody that'll actually believe him and will actually commit and stand up and claim what's theirs and ask he said ask that your joy might be full but the problem is is we get in our way of god working so here they are when when god calls and he tells moses moses just speak when moses lord what are we going to do we're here at the red sea we got an army behind us where we going now what was it god called give him a commission of where to go just go forward moses when you went to when you stood out there when i told you to go beside the nile and curse the waters and it turned to blood what did you do you just spoke it was just you speaking when you stood up there and you raised your rod and you called for the fleas and the flies the lice and the frogs what did you do you just spoke the word and the word come to pass now what is it when you come before this great red sea when you're standing there before this water that you look it's it's so uncrosstable what do you do just speak why because you've been commissioned you've been commissioned to do something just speak the word and go forward like he was like why are you crying to me why because you've seen me work up till now all the things that i've done just speak yes and so moses spoke the word and the waters parted and they crossed on dry land and all of a sudden when they cross over that land here they are going going toward the promised land and all of a sudden then here comes pharaoh in his army they're coming after them they think they're going to take over take them but let me tell you you can't walk if you're not walking the right with god you know what you're not going to walk the same path that's right brother you can't you can't walk this way amen if it it's it's a true walk with god you gotta be totally sold out surrendered to god if you're gonna come over and so here they are as they cross over then we see that the egypt egyptian army was destroyed here they are destroyed in this flood and the water because they were not called to walk that way and here they are every time that they have an opposition a a problem arises then every single time as they face that obstacle god brings them through and here's rahab standing here and saying you know what we've not even seen y'all we've not seen y'all but you know what we've just heard y'all we've heard about y'all so here it is as we stand here we heard how you because you know what when you got the greatest army in the world when you're sitting here looking at the greatest army in the world with the greatest world power and all of a sudden they don't have an army anymore that makes front page news it's all of a sudden you know then here they are everybody else knows egyptians don't have an army anymore they don't have any chariots anymore they're all in the bottom of the red sea that makes news for everybody then the other two world powers that don't don't believe because you know what if if i saw pharaoh's army and you know and they got destroyed you know what if i was if i was the kings of the amorites you know what i would just say ride this way i wouldn't waste my time but you know what he didn't stop sign haunting they decided hey we're going to get in front of you we want to oppose you why because they were under the judgment of god so they read so when rahab stood there and realized you know she's under judgment because she's in jericho and jericho is under because they're going because they're going to utterly destroy everything that's in that promised land and she's beginning they're speaking to the pro to the to the spies listen we've heard what god has done and she's like i want to be on the right side because i realize what your god's going to do what your god can do and i want to be on the right side yeah i won't i want i want to cry out for mercy i want to be spared so what can i what can i do she had heard of those things it wasn't just just some idea or theology or anything like that she saw something that was real not being not being a pagan and and having some idol made of wood or of gold or something like that but actually knowing there's a true living god that can move that can come on the scene and move and she's like this is what i want i want i want this god to be to lead me verse 12 says now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have showed kindness you kindness that you will also show kindness under my father's house and give me a true token and that ye will save a lot of my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death and the men answered her our life for yours if you utter not this our business and it shall be when the lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then did she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall so we know that as she made the commandment and they give her a token a sign of what would take place and then she allowed them to help them escape and she said unto them go you to the mountain lest the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers be returned and afterward may you go your way and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this done oath which thou hast made a swayer said behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou just led us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all the father's household home unto thee so she was given a commission of what she was supposed to do she was given a sign now this is this is from this is from the great warrior joshua and brother random speaking and he's speaking of joshua coming in and he says he said now we're going to see what the land looks like so he sent out the spies they went and the harlot rahab seen them through the night i want you to notice another thing watch what taken place when they were up here harlot rahab's house harlot rahab she had hid them up under the flanks of the top of the roof sent the men out of the gates and come back said look now god now watch how gods are moving take this encouragement back to joshua he said all this country faith because of you said we have heard what the lord has done for you amen i just love that don't you worry god's got a good time coming by and by all the country is afraid of you when you when we heard that the lord dried up the red sea and let you cross drown pharaoh's army give you food by manna out of out in the wilderness put up a brass serpent up for an atonement he done all these things for you and i know what you've done destroyed the og and the other kings i see what you did utterly destroyed and when we heard this and you were headed our way we just fainted there's no more courage left in no one why because god had done these things and they began to see the condition that they were in and they began to faint why because and it's just like as the world is today we see everybody begins to faint of the condition that the world is in today there's only one place there's only one sure foundation you're going to stand and that's in jesus christ on christ the solid rock i stand all other ground is sinking sand there's no other place to stand they said but they saw what had taken they'd heard these things they said we just we just fainted we just melted there's no there's no courage there's no strength in any of us said when they come back and told that to joshua he said i can imagine him swirling the sword say glory to god he's before us amen what made them faint when they they when they became so faintly when they were way bigger now listen why why they said we look like grasshoppers up beside them how could they faint they were sitting behind big walls and big slings and rocks and everything and spears and everything outnumbered by thousands times thousands and thousands they outnumbered them certainly they could they were all united together why can't we run the bunch little handful of little bitty old scrawny scrubby looking men with old sickle bars and things like that to fight with now you know what we're not taught we're not talking about some polished army not not some army that looked like the egyptian army but we're just talking about ordinary men when when brother ramsey when when the army of jericho when jericho began to look and see what what they look like there was nothing that from the physical the natural standpoint they should be worried about them when you begin to speak and you think about that jericho had walls they could run chariots on when you begin to think of the size of the army and the condition that they were up against why would why would anybody be worried about about israel about the children of israel because they're so small right and we're so great and we're so we're so large when you begin to see what what what is what is around me but they realize that didn't have it they didn't have anything to do with it why because here was this great army and they had seen what happened to the other kings and the egyptians so you know when you when you look at what's around you the physical the natural so you can't you can't put your faith in those things you know because you can you can have you can have all the money in the world one day and be broke the next you can be perfectly healthy one day and be absolutely on your death bed the next right he doesn't it doesn't matter you can have you can have everything go your way and the next day everything goes against you it changes just as the just as the wind blows just as a snap of a finger it all changes the book of james tells us that the light our life is just like a vapor so we don't know how long we're going to be here that's right if we try to put our faith in the natural things our intelligence the same the same people that we that we see today that that the intelligence that people the people want you to trust in them because they have they have such great minds on how to figure things out and solve problems and we're going we're going to make everything better and they can't figure out if they're boys or girls and people want to put confidence in that we got we got a government that blows money like there's like it's going out of style and there's no there's no end to it and you know what it's all around the world government's everywhere and people people want to put their confidence in a government when every single one of when satan and jesus was talking he told them that every single one of those governments the whole wide world belonged to satan that's right and if and if satan is in charge of it then you know what it's all going to be destroyed it's all going to destruction but there's one thing that won't fail there's one thing that won't change and that's the word of god jesus said heaven and earth will pass away he said but my word will not pass away if you're going to stand on something sure and stand behind something to be fortified behind something that's the word of god he said continuing on he says they're not military men at all the only thing they are walking along with them little bitty old sandals not warriors or campers and dwellers and fanatics and holy rollers well why why can't we standing down on the banks and shouting and screaming bringing disgrace why can't we can't we armor ourselves and go against them there was nothing in the hearts why god said i'll send my fear before you amen there it is i'll send my fear before you for my people my covenant people i've called you by election i have chosen you i have put you into the body and you're circumcised now you're believers and you go on i'm with you it's all yours so he has called them into a place so it's not has anything to do with the natural or the physical but it's all what god has done what god has called them to now we continue on verse 19 and it says that it shall be that whosoever go shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any man if any hand be upon him and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of of thine oath which thou has made us to swear and she said according unto your words so be it and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the window and they went and came unto the mountain above their three days until the pursuers were returned and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way but found them not so the two men returned and descended from the mountain and passed over and came to joshua the son of nun and told them all things that befell them and they said unto joshua truly the lord hath delivered into our hands all the land for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us amen so we know that the word went forth and they had received it and they realized that it's encouraging to realize not just not just what what god had told them but when the word came back from the land then they realized hey you know what god has laid all this in our hands god has called us into this land and it's ours now we're going to go in and possess what belongs to us no you know this is from from as i was with moses so i'll be with thee and brother brother i'm speaking and he's talking about rahab and he said one day she heard that there was a god that was moving her heart began to tremble she found a messenger that was a great move she that told her what was going to take place he said what did what did she say no joshua had signed joshua had the same signs that moses had exactly but said she didn't ask to see the signs she just heard she heard what had taken place she didn't she didn't go out to see any of the signs so she didn't go out to find out she didn't see them in any manner fall from the heavens she never saw the waters part or any of those things but she believed what she had heard so just believing as jesus told thomas he said blessed are those that have not seen and believe it's one thing it's one thing to see and believe but he said greater is the blessing when you don't see and then you believe when you can believe what you've not seen but you've heard and something stirred inside of her that she was going to believe what was told to her and then we see that she took that that scarlet thread as they told her they had a scarlet thread and she tied it in the window as a token of what of what had been spoken to her that token was given to her to be put on display because what what she had heard in her time that was her that was the oath that they had made to her that was going to be the covenant to her and same way with you and i today we have we have a covenant you know as we've been preaching on for so you know in the different ones why why it's so important why because you know what you're not going to get anywhere unless you have the token it is so important to have the token not just not just to think that you have it or talk about it but it's got to be a true indwelling it's got to be a real true possession and as as it was we know that she heard those preachers those messengers came and began to speak to her and when they come her across her path she realized the condition that she was in and she got desperate she reached a place of desperation but you know what she became to the place she was going to hang on to that she was going to hang on to that scarlet threat and it was put in the window and when it was tied into the window of the of her home then it became her job to get those that of her family into the house because you know there was no other place it was going to be but one place that was going to have safety and that was her home and it's the same way with you and i the same thing is that if you have if you've been received the token what is what is the token it's the new birth it's the holy ghost inside of you why is it so important not not to have just some kind of dried eye confession not just say well i went to the altar and i shook the preacher's hand but it's got to have but it's got to be a life of jesus christ manifested in you that you manifest christ that christ has taken up while you've sold out you've died out to yourself and you've allowed him to come in and take over and have the leadership and when he takes over and he resides in you then it becomes no longer eyes paul said no longer i that live now but it's christ that lives in me that he has the preeminence then the token can be on display so each person has to have that token on display for themselves i can't get in because my mama has it i can't get in because my daddy has it i can't get in because i come to this church i got to have an experience for myself i've got to know that i know that i know that when i come to death's doorstep then you know what that is only going to bring me from this dimension into another i'm going to step into the presence of god that i'm that i've got that assurance that i'm leaving here and going someplace else not just not just crossing over and telling some good kind of story why because there better not be anything that holds us back and because you know our brothers and sisters god has called us in this day and by by the scripture has called us in this day there's a group that's going to be standing waiting that's going to be calling for the dead to come out of the ground first thessalonians 4 is going to call there's going to be somebody that's not going to hinder or prevent those that are asleep to come back amen [Music] as paul said in first corinthians 15 he said behold i show you a mystery he said we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye why because there's something that's going to carry us over that we're going to be waiting to speak to them that it's going to come out of the ground now it's not just some fairy tale that's going to come a hundred years we don't know it may come in the morning but the thing is today is the day of salvation the day is a day that you make sure that you're ready to go because you never know when you're going to leave we're not we're not promised tomorrow we're not even promised this afternoon but there's one thing that we do have a promise that wherever we step and we come over whatever we come to god's going to lead us all the way and there's a place that we can go when we leave here we have it we have a tabernacle we have a house not made by hands eternal in the heavens that when we step out of this dimension we step into that one that we are there with the with the ones that have passed that god's going to carry us all the way whichever way whatever we go through god is leading us and he's there he's given us a token but the problem is is you've got to accept it just as rahab she had she had the messengers come and speak to her and you know what she began to confess what she believed and not only did she confess what she believed then she turned around and she done exactly what they told her to do she had an oath that was given to her and she walked in that oath praise the lord that's our that's our job you know i've got i've got two boys and you know what they can't they can't come in they can't come in because mom and daddy's got it it's my job to make sure that they get it do i hold the token over there the token life is applied over them and she held and she applied ray have applied the token to her house and you know what it was her job to get them inside the house to get them in the uh into the place of safety because there's no other place that it's going to be but where god has called you to be where god has called you to put that token in your in yourself he comes and lives in your heart in your life then you've got to take that same token and apply it to your household your family you've got to be the ones that's got to stand for them we got to we got to commit because i believe that every one of the children that's in this church you know they can go out and do whatever they want to live any kind of life whatever they want to live but you know what that token is still there the token is still applied i'm still we still claim our children it's not a hope so or we worry about no we're gonna put our we're gonna put our confidence in god why because he said so i put my you got to put your children and god i put my children in god's hands i don't want because you know what i don't want it to come sometime in the future and then they look at me and say well daddy you didn't live the right kind of life daddy you've done this and you've done that i want them to see jesus christ in me i want to be so sold out that they don't see aaron roberts i want to be so sold out that they see jesus christ in me i want them to know what a true living christian walking in shoe leather looks like why because the world can be so full of fakes and so so many hypocrites and everybody that's all everybody wants to point to is what the hypocrites well look at this one look at the way they live and look at that one and then you know i want somebody to point to the one because the devil always wants to point you to the counterfeits but i want them to know what a real true genuine born-again child of god looks like i want them to know what god manifested in human flesh again looks like not just some idea but just some thought it's just some pretty pictures or words but may it be manifested may it be a life i want them to know who god is for themselves it's the life behind the name we got to know the name we got to walk in jesus name everything that we do is in his name if we don't have we don't take on his name we ain't got anything let's walk in we walk in the light as he is in the light we want to walk in the light of the word that he shines as we were speaking before let us walk in the light as he is in the light we got to focus that's what our focus is on the light as he shines that light we want to focus on those things he's he gives us that token and i want to walk and see that i'm everything that i say and do is pleasing to him that it that it manifests him i want to be what he wants me to be i don't want to have my own thoughts or beliefs or ideas because you know you know the the spies told her said listen you got to get your family in this house and you got to tie this scarlet thread in the window you got to get you got to line things up well you know what she's like well you know what i'm just going to hang it on the on the mailbox or you know i'll get to it tomorrow no it was it was imperative that she get it hung because you know what she didn't know how long it was going to take before they got back because you know the thing is when we read in the scripture we don't know how long it took them in the scripture reading we realized that joshua and the army was still on the other side they still on the other side of jordan and so when they crossed back over jordan and they talked to joshua then we realized that later on joshua and the children of israel cross over they cross over jordan they reach into that's when they reach into the river and they pick up the stones and they set a memorial in the river and then they set a memorial on the outside of the river and then they come over there and they're waiting now here they stack these stones the scripture tells us later on that while while rahab is waiting in her house trying to persuade her family to get into the or get into the house of safety to get under that scarlet thread we realize that the children of israel have crossed over they have to circumcise those that were not circumcised in the wilderness they suck they sacrifice and uh do the uh passover the whole passover and then when they come from that then after the after everybody after the men have healed from the from the circumcision then they prepared to go to jericho so you know what it wasn't it wasn't that the men just slipped out and then you know she's like well you know i'm just waiting for him to come back and you know the brother said that that god's biggest enemies is sight and time and so here they are there's you know she she could get uh discouraged and she you know she could but what where they had because you know i i've seen them leave but they're not they're not back well they left yesterday they're not back today it's been a week they're not back you know what hey we don't we don't know when the lord's coming we don't know what god's plan is but you know we got to be ready for every minute we've got to be ready every at any time we don't know what's going to take place but we have to keep watching and that's what she had to she was watching to see what was going to take place every single day it was you got to be in the house you got to be in the house you got to be under this ark you got to be under this covenant that has taken place this oath that's been given me you got to be in this house you got to get in here and stay and every day she you know she goes out and you can imagine trying to live your life and everything that you do well i got to go get some water well we got to go get water but we got to go get food we got to take care of these things but we got to be in the house always looking to see where we're at because we never know when it's going to take place when this thing's going to take place we got to be there to get in this ark we got to get in this house this this refuge it says or where we got to be at when all this thing takes place not just worried about everything else but get in the house be under that token and so when they when they began to see these things well wait they didn't come they didn't come today they didn't come they didn't come yesterday keep a watchful eye we never as jesus said we you know not when the lord cometh but you always got to be ready not leave things undone not just let little things slip by take everything under consideration take care of every little thing he said we take care of all these things and brother iran says we have a token today he said he said as long as he said it's the blood of jesus christ he said we have to stay under that each individual stays under that token themselves we must we must receive that ourselves we come into that land take that you know old things have passed away you come in and become a new creature in christ jesus so when you come into you you let all the other things pass and it becomes new to you i and not not to hold on to these things but to following god leaving the things that are behind us you know you you can't you can't look ahead and you can't look ahead and see what god has for you if you spend all your time looking in the rearview mirror people people you know they they look at all the things that have taken place in the past and they wonder why things happen and go and the devil wants you to keep your eye on those things what are we what are we looking back for we look at all we'll look at all our failures all our faults and all our sins and then we'll stand up and say it's covered by the blood it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness that not to be remembered anymore not to be remembered anymore not to be remembered anymore well if he's not remembered and why are you remembering it why is it but say the devil that's what he's got you looking at what's what you've done what you come from but let me tell you something it's not where you came from it's where you finish it's where you end up that's what's important it's not where you start i was speaking to a man at work today or the other day and we were talking and he was talking about a young man that's that's working with us and man he is he is a super nice guy and he's and he really works hard and everything like that and he's got so much going for him and everybody said man if you if you saw the life that this boy came from it's a wonder he does anything because his parents are so worthless and every you know he's never had he's never had a thing going right in his life but you know what when you told to him you know what he's not down he's a he you know he's one of the nicest guys that you want to be around and you won't talk about somebody that's got a positive attitude you know what because we can we can we can look and we can have the worst attitude about things or we can we can look and have the best attitude about things it's how we approach it whether whether we like it or not many people they they go along and you know if you give them a million dollars they would be upset that they'd have to give half of it to the government in taxes they instead of realizing i got a half a million dollars they'd be more worried about what they got more upset with what they lost than what they gained if you give them if you give them a dollar they'd be upset they didn't get two dollars if you give them five dollars they didn't get 10. and it didn't really matter because but no matter how much you give to them they can't be blessed by what they got when you see other people that haven't got anything they haven't have a lot harder than we have it and you know what they are more blessed and more happy and more joyous what they know what they've got and we're over blessed and we got all the because you know the scripture tells us in psalms the scripture tells us that the blessing of the lord it maketh rich and he addeth no sorrow to it you know one of the reasons i was thinking about this the other day you know that's the reason why god don't bless people like they want to get blessed people want to be millionaires they got that slogan lord make me a millionaire so i can show you that it won't ruin me god knows but the scripture says he's not going to bless you if he knows it's going to add sorrow to you well because some people they want to get blessed but you know what they're not in a position to receive that they're not in a position to receive blessings from god why because they don't know how to handle it and so it can it just adds more problems but god knows how to bless us and give us what we have need of and many times we fail to realize that that our trials and our tribulations paul said they work at their work their weight in gold they're more precious than gold to us so if they're more precious than gold then you know what our our trials and our tribulations and our problems and you know what they are what makes us rich but people don't see that why because it's through those things that we face that god brings us through we put our trust in him that when he brings us through these things and you know then we realize you know i'm a more than a conqueror through him that love me then i've become a place then i realize you know i can overcome these things because i'm being molded by him by the things that i suffered just like jesus he became as the scripture says you know he learned by the things that he suffered so we have to learn by the things that we suffer you know our our moms and our dads you know you know they they give us a lot of hard times in life sometimes you know we but you know what it's it's some of the best learning that we ever get you know paul said one time he said he said you know our fathers corrected us and we give them honor well how much more than our heavenly father bring us through these things that we give him more honor you see you see children they get they get anything and everything that they want but you know what it doesn't it doesn't bless them richard and i i guess richard's in the back i don't see him but you know what richard i we have we have these times where we just get together and we talk about things that we went through in our childhood that wasn't too funny back then but you know we laugh about now hey you know you know my dad you know my dad always said when i was growing up we had this and we didn't have that and all these things and then you know i sound like my dad sometimes because i tell the boys when i was growing up we didn't have this and we had that we've done this and done that well because you start every morning you wake up and you look in the mirror and you see dale roberts i do i wake up oh there's dead and then i start to hear him why because that's who i am i'm a son of dale roberts how much more being a son of god but i think about the things that that richard and i have you know i remember getting out trying to mow the yard and with a push mower and the handlebar on the the bar on the mower about that tall being a hey if we're big enough to mow you know we could push the mower with mowing the yard and it was like sometimes it's like all you could do try to pull the string to get the mower running and we pulled and we got it going and get out there and had a bar at the top one on the bottom in the middle and i would have here and here and just push everything that i had trying to move that yard trying to mow the grass and you know everybody's like well you know what we need a self-propelled we need a zero turn no hey we had zero turns we turned it we made zero turns we've done it ourselves you know people people don't realize that the blessing that god has given them by the things that they've had to go through you know dad always said that he wasn't going to buy a dishwasher he said because he had four of them but you know we went through those things well but but you know it's a blessing now now it wasn't a blessing then and same thing when we look at things that we have to go through in our lives god brings us to situations in our lives and you know what we don't stop and think thank you lord that's what i wanted but when we look back then we say thank god that he brought me through those things that i've been through those battles that i've been through those mountains but i've been through those valleys because god's brought me someplace he's brought me through we got to stay under that under that token it's so important so it's the if if you if you don't get anything else get the token right how how you got to have an experience of a new birth that's what jesus told nicodemus you must be born again if there's nothing else we got to be born again if you know you wish you could just give it to people but you know what god didn't force it down your throat you can't force it down anybody else's but all you can do is offer it and be a shining example as brother branham said let's be salty because if you display it they'll desire it they'll see something that's different about you you know here we're gonna go to joshua chapter six before we finish this morning and verse 15. and the scripture tells us here it says and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same matter seven times only on that on that day they can pass the city seven times and he said it came to pass at the seventh time when the priest blew with the trumpets joshua said unto the people shout for the lord hath given you the city and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are therein to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live she and all that are with her in in the house where because she hid the messengers that we sent he said and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing lest you make yourselves accursed when you take of the accursed thing [Music] and make the camp of israel a curse and trouble it but all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the lord they shall come into the treasury of the lord so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout and the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city and every man straight before them and they took the city so we know that when when he began to speak and they come into the land and it came time god didn't face the this great fortress as most people would have thought it now here they now here they are now when you see the here they come out and they're going to fight and god tells them to listen when you go up don't make a sound so don't try to argue with nobody just going about your business and so here they are you go around the first day you're just gonna walk around the walls and then you come back to camp and the second day you'll go up and walk around the walls and come back to camp now no doubt when these people because if they were if the people of jericho were fearful and they didn't have any any uh strength they didn't have any fight him do you know how to scare somebody you know they always say walk around when you smile at somebody and somebody wonder what you're up to you know how to do that you know how to walk up to somebody and say something that they don't they're expecting you to say and then you make them uncomfortable well if you've got a group around up there that are looking at these people and they're already nervous don't say nothing and walk around the place and then leave there was a there was a lady years ago that used to come into the mcdonald's up in tennessee where mom lives and she would i've seen her just walk in and she stare at the menu for a while just stare at the sign and then turn around walk out and people stand there like well can you imagine these people walking up there every day don't say nothing you walk around the building and leave and then the next day they get up there walk around and leave and walk around and leave and hear all these people every single day there was more of them looking over the wall jericho like you see these nuts what are they doing i don't know this makes no sense and here they come again another day they're doing the same thing and people trying to figure out whether you know what there's no book that tells us anything about this there's no ancient writings there's no nothing we don't have any idea what they're doing because god didn't speak to them he spoke to joshua joshua knew what he was doing the rest of them didn't know and every single day to that last day then they get up there and it's like walk around seven times and it's like they're walking around again they're walking around again well no one of these people these people are scared to death well here they are walking oh it's the sabbath day and now they're making all these laps around the place i don't know about you but you know what i ain't got nothing you know you're just about ready to run i mean you you're just you're just shaking he's like we ain't never seen this before and look at what they're doing but you know what every single time they made a lap you know what then they had confidence in what was going to take place joshua told them said we're going to walk around this thing seven times he said then the trump the priests are going to blow the trumpets and he said you're going to shout these mighty massive walls but you know what the promise was given to rahab that she wouldn't she wouldn't be hurt and so we we see that how they walked around and they blew the trumpets and they shouted and the walls fail now the scripture says the walls fell down if you read and read in the in the original it actually says the walls fell flat they actually went down when you look at when you look at the archaeology digs of the of the ancient city of jericho when they actually dug up jericho and they look at it you know they can actually see where the walls fail but you know what there's there's a section of the wall they said it was eight me uh two meters high it's like eight feet high there's a whole section of the wall back there and there's there's two there was two walls there's a lower wall in the upper wall the mighty walls were the upper ones and they had a lower wall at the bottom and they said you know all of the lower people the lower class people lived along the bottom that little short wall down there do you know there's a section of they said there's a section in there of all the walls that fail there's a section that didn't if still standing why because god's word is true and all the walls fail but you know what where rehab was it didn't fall she was under that token of safety god's word held it and they come in and they brought her out the scripture says and and continue on in here in in chapter six and it says and they utterly destroyed all that were in the city both men and women young and old ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the sword but joshua said unto the two men that had spied over out the country go into the harlots house and bring out vince the woman and all that she hath as you swear unto her and the young men that were spies went in and brought out rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she had and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the camp of israel and then they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and iron they put into the treasury of the house of god and joshua saved rahab the heart of the life and her father's household and all that she had and she dwelleth in israel even unto this day because she had messengers which joshua sent to spy out jericho so everything that was destroyed except for what god had promised her through her faith in god's word what god had done she had faith in and she believed those messengers that came and everything else was destroyed except for her and she came out and she and the scripture tells us that she dwelt in in with joshua and the children of israel all this time and you know it's amazing when you when you look to see where she came from to where she ended up here's a woman that didn't have anything a low reputation poor all these things that was against her but you know what she had faith in god and you know do you know where she ended up it's not where you start it's where you end up it's where you finish where did where did she where did we know that where she ended up what did she finish you know what she was the matriarch of the kings here's a woman that was of no reputation was poor a woman of ill repute but you know what all the things that she faced in her life she had faith in god and god brought her out brought her to a place and you know what as as i've said many times all of of rahab's past was in that fire all her sins and all of her failures and all her disappointments when they burnt that city that's where all it was she came out with her family and her belongings but you know her past was in that fire and that rubble and that destruction that's where her past was because when she came out she was a brand new person and you know the scripture tells us that she had a husband named salman who was a who was a general and she brought forth the scripture tells us in matthew chapter one says and salman begot boaz of rahab he said and boaz beget obed of ruth and obed begat jesse and jesse beget david the king and the david the king begat solomon of her that had been the wife of uriah so here's a woman that that had no reputation of all the things that she had been through but you know what she had faith in god to believe what god could do for her and when god when she had faith in god and walked in that and held on to that token and it brought her out do you know what she became the mother of the kings and brothers and sisters this morning doesn't matter where you start it's where you finish what you feel how you've run this race we all have we all have faults and figures we all have problems we all have a but you know what it's where you go from there and so this morning this morning we'll have the musicians come but this morning if we look at that what a blessed thing to not know where you where you come from but where you're going and if you're you know you're a mom and you you got lost kids you got wayward loved ones whatever you hold on to that token god will bring them through whatever you have need of he's gonna he's gonna give it to you and brothers and sisters the bride is to bring forth christ if rahab through her faith brought forth the kings of israel you know what as the bride of jesus christ we're supposed to bring forth the king of kings and lord of lords that's what we're to do manifest him so this morning let's all stand whatever you have need of god has made a way for you put your trust in him hold on to that token if you've not received the token then you know he's here this morning to give it to you he wants to give it to you more than you desire it but you know what if he's brought you this far brother ryan then you know what he's going to carry the rest of the way and so i will i want to let him have his way with me this morning and let him just do
