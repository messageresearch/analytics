you're just going to see a man it's good to be in the house and Lord where's Bob where's Bob weird Bob Bob and my waterboy you'll get it in a minute we're good to be in the house with Lord good to have each and every one of you here this is a little strange for me but that's ok we'll get threat good to see all your smiling faces Bob already knows this but he's preaching Wayne 50 nights so keep him in your prayer you man and while everybody's coming in you can have your seat for a minute will I want to make an announcement so I won't keep you standing so long and it's coming up with the Father's Day fishing trip we always have it every year Father's Day but this year the devil saw fit to wash the road out so we can't get in to the to the campsite so we're going to have to readjust so what we've done is is we took a little trip up to to Guillou State Park which is about 30 minutes up the road and it's a really nice place is run by the state of Georgia and we're going to this is the only problem we're going to have it's just I'm going to try to make this announcement and then Joe will give you all the information you need so if you have any questions it'll all be on sheet of paper so there Bob I'll get you one witness tonight we'll trade the favor how about that okay that all right well you got a high and tight didn't you ma'am Monica get a hold of your head good thing about hair when somebody messes up it grows back but we're going to its death right instead of us going up on Thursday and fishing and doing the camping until Saturday we're going to have to do this on Father's Day we will be going up right after church at 3:30 on June the 17th that is father's days for all you men and then we will stay in till Tuesday morning the 19th all right all the information will be there we have three campsites and a cabin and I always think of brother Gary Krantz every year because most of you don't know this but he drags that big old Outfitters tent up there every year and it's about as big as half of this building literally and about him taking it up you know he's not getting any younger so we're trying to no he said no it's not so what we've done is is we're in in three years you know what a year it is yard is a looks like a teepee on steroids what it is I miss you it's a big round thing you know with with six bear or six to futons in a bed short of sleep six and full power we will have showers for those of you that need it most of you that need it and it sleeps six so that would be 18 people in the Ertz and then we rented one cabin which sleeps eight and for some of you older ones that want to come that have never been before brother Colley you can this air conditioning and it has full kitchen so that's what we'll be doing all the cooking so we've kind of upgraded a little bit you know dad said one time we brother Joe green I'm have you been to the camp meeting to brother Joe greens for years it was under a what under a shed eight hundred and fifty degrees no doubt you sweat when you were just thinking much less singing and praising the Lord so then now they got they have it at the college up there which is fully air-conditioned really nice padded seats and dad told brother Joe brother Joe green was kind of saying one day he said well I you know this just don't feel like camp meeting you know Davis said look brother we getting older this feels just fine so you know and then brother Joe said that when he where'd the gap me brother brother Joe said well brother Dale thinks it's a good thing we're having it here so the same way with the Father's Day fishing trip it's always been fun we've always drug stuff up there you know 30 mile or eight miles so it took you 30 minutes to get there and we were you know trout fishing and having a good time we're just going to readjust this year though and it really for those of you older ones that want to come because it was a rough trip for the older ones brother Dick's always wanted to come to the fish fry so what we're going to do is though is on we're gonna leave on Sunday we're gonna have hamburgers and hot dogs that evening but if you want to come up men only no ladies no girls well your Mother's Day was the other day okay but Monday evening we're going to have a Lowcountry boil which will be corn and new potatoes and somebody said we can get some crawfish which is fine we'd get some crawfish and shrimp some crab legs and we'll boil them things up and have a Monday night so for any of you men that are not camping but want to come we'll get you all the information you can come up to the air-conditioned cabin amen yes right and we will have a Lowcountry bowl there on Monday evening and then we'll leave on Tuesday mornings so all men are invited children bring whoever you want to but that's what we've always done they'll always I'll have all the information and I'll have all the things there's things to do there's Danny won't have to take the horse shoes I got a horseshoe thing over there horseshoes kayaking Knievel a ball miniature golf tennis you can do a lot of things over there so we thought we would do that this year the church is paying all expenses which is roughly about $800 for all that so we're paying for all that all you need to do is bring yourself and your favorite drink but gentlemen for those of you that have not been coming please come it's really nice it's everything's paved it's like I said there's bathroom showers and everything for for you older ones Oh Kylie that would like to come so so there's the father's day fishing thing is weary just and you know next year we may go back up to because we've always had fun we've always you know it's been almost 10 years we went to went up to the upper Chattahoochee where the big Chattahoochee River you see down here starts as a little river about this wide and we've always been trout fishing out there there's plenty of places to fish it'll just be different we'll be fishing for bream and catfish and bass it but there is good fishing around the lake up there too so we'll be good for the men to get out and just have a couple of days of R&R so let's stand to our feet and get started so keep acting your mind in your heart it will be Father's Day Sunday Monday and Tuesday all right so keep that and we'd love for you know like I said we've got places for 32 people so so brothers it's just a good time to get together and fellowship and have a good time and somebody can get up and come together maybe come to the to the low country ball on Monday I really enjoy those I like we go to Jim's dad's every year Thanksgiving and we've about already eat enough turkey and ham so we have a Low Country boil for Thanksgiving and it's really good so just keep those things in your heart and prayer pray for us then all the weather will be good and everything will be fine so also one more thing to announce brother direct for those of you the word he wins tonight they're closing on their house on May the 29th which is not this coming Tuesday but the day after Memorial Day so just pray that all goes well he'll be up there for a couple weeks and get all that taken care of and get back down here so good to the Lord's good to him got that thing sold pretty quick so let's go to Lourdes and prayer the only father we thank you today Lord that you give us a time set aside Lord as we were reading Scripture this morning you've give us a time for rest rest in our soul not a day of Sunday or or anything like that but a day of rest you've give us in our soul that's made for an eternity and Lord today though may we hear from you and let these things go into our heart and our minds and may we think about these things Lord is we walk along the way called life either forgive us of our sins or many mistakes you be the active participant in this service Lord you do the speaking you do the hearing father and you're the only one that can do the revealing be with our pastor Lord is he's away for a little R&R a little time off he can sit and listen be with some really good friends over there and Jasper Georgian Lord but brother pageant they just bless them be with them take care of them be aboard and Janet they're traveling today - you can Gail and the ones that are not here father we pray this would just be with them drive them back home Lord give them a safe journey just be with us today and bless us give us this day our daily bread in Jesus name we pray amen feel kind of comfortable because I don't like to rush through this and I got this afternoon you know so this is pretty good revelation 6 verse 1 and saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him behold a white horse and he's telling them how to bow and a crown was given unto him and went forth conquering and to conquer alright we've been through that and now this is going to be the last one last service on the second seal we'll be starting on the third seal this afternoon and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and it went out another horse that was red and power was given unto him to set thereon to take peace from the earth and he should kill they should kill one another and that was given unto him a great sword and may be seated in the Lord as blessing to the reading of the work go get char now I get it not you stay right there one day we might get one of these it comes down out of the ceiling you never know wasn't much of an amen to that and because y'all don't use it you know just watch it we are we are actually working on that we have probably discussed that this morning actually brother so we are we are coming together on some of these things you know we voted the other day to spend some money on getting them redoing this whole system so I've always wanted one where you I could sit here and control the the quotes not waiting on them not saying anything to them but still when you won't make a thought you can sit down and hit that button and it'll it'll you know you control it so anyway that's technology all right so now here we go we were looking at the first seal just for a background just for a minute which was the lion we see there's Lion ox man and eagle all right so that's your for combat beast and they were present with John on the Isle of Patmos now John John didn't see these separate and think man let's no John knew John had to holyoke John knew what that was that said come and see it was the spirit of the odds the spirit of the man the spirit of the eagle the spirit of the line alright because those for combat beasts are present today so what I was thinking about it yesterday so what we're looking in this second even in the second seal of sanctification that we see that it's a work and we'll get into it just a minute it's a work that we have something to do with because you can't justify yourself no way but you can help in the sanctification because remember the unclean spirit goes out why does the unclean spirit goes out how do you cast out demons in the name of Jesus Christ and man you cast out demons in the name of Jesus Christ not in your name but you in listen but remember to remember brother Branham and the maniac he said that man loved some I asked and said brother roundest didn't we that spirit was cast out of him he said but he came back he tells the people in the prayer line he said you believe because this thing will come back why you like it what our problem is as we like some of these demons hello somebody we like some of these demons they're good to us they're really nice they're sweet but they're demons bottom line all right so in this in this what I think about yesterday in this sanctification process the unclean spirit goes out and we were talking about last Sunday about compartmentalizing these things take away the flesh take away the flesh I am NOT trying to get this thing perfected it will follow it will come and I'm gonna read your scripture this afternoon before we get started in Isaiah and it'll help us kind of give us a little boost because I think there's something coming you know talking about the volcanoes in in Hawaii and the different things that are happening look at the world in so much turmoil why is the world in turmoil this because you and I are in turmoil something is going on that what the things that we have let reside I said reside not in the soul see so take the soul out if you're born again the souls just as perfect as God is actually the soul is not just as perfect as God is it is God all right so I can't you can't up and down in the soul if you're born again push it out it's that spirit realm the memory reason conscious affection imagination that's where Satan can still roam around amen but by the sanctifying process at first baby form sanctification he has to clean that out of the soul so that God can come in I read your quote the other day so God can come in God's not going to dwell in an unclean vessel something's got to be clean and set aside for service then the Holy Ghost can come in or if you leave it open the devil is going to come right back in gonna put you in the message church hello I may put you in the message Church you say yeah I believe brother Browns a prophet so does the devil the devil believes in one Garden feeds us a Trinity the devil knows there's not three people standing up there because you know what he's in that same realm he talks to that guy he's been talking to him since he created him Satan has been talking to God since God created the devil let me put that right amen he's never come to a place and said well I think there's three no he knows there's one but two what to dilute our to water the word down he says I think I'll get them to believe in three that way they get so confused they don't know who they talking to you know there's only one God we know that and Jesus Christ is his name and to me that's why it's so important with that first seal when that first seal opens and shows one true and living God that ought to settle everything because remember in that first part of justification those who he is justified he's already glorified so once you start into that justification process not baby for me baby form justification you can be saved and be lost a man because it doesn't do anything to the unclean spirit the first baby form justification just chopped your past sins off and God don't remember them no more but the prophet of God said that thing still there that root of evil so you just keep going and why you just get worse you just keep going and piling it up well yeah if you die you have a chance but you still got to go to the white throne judgement collects not bribed see I'm talking to bride when we're talking about these seals I'm talking about Bryce my brother Ram said he said I can call you bride now why he knew who he was talking to he had what he had come and he'd look at this big scope of people that he was preaching to and as he got more and more into the word of his message and then not the signs and wonders that brought everybody that brought the mixed multitude that brought everybody in but when he started preaching his message in the seals and past that he told him he said thousands of my friends will why he was narrowing down sure there was a bride for that age there was a bride for that Pentecostal age but he's not talking to that age he's talking to me and you remember you remember the crystal that we talked about that crystal is here that this is the people he was talking to amen so we listen were the people that should understand we should be understanding that that there is a baby for justification but when you come into the body of Christ when you come to that day of rest never brother Brown they asked him questions about that he said up there rest is not Sunday it's not Saturday he said you enter into rest when you get born again amen but see now that to me is a catch-22 because you enter into the day of rest but today you get born against when all your trouble starts why because Satan keeps doing this you know why he keeps trying to get back in I liked it in there you were my good soldier what's going on so he works with the spirit realm if he can't get you in the soul he's gonna work on that spirit realm he's gonna remind you of everything you don't a mint he's gonna make you reason own things and that's why these cells what comes brings everything to a point laser-focused your I must be single you know when you look with a pair of binoculars sure you got two eyes you got one on each side of your nose but when I'm looking I don't see two images I see one why because it's a focus but now you take a binoculars and you move them just a little bit and get them out of focus what you still see but it's real fuzzy what we're trying to do now is by the Word of God by the preaching that's been in 50 something years since the Prophet left we're trying to thinking about this yesterday hold in get everything down to forget about this forget about that forget about what people think about you forget about what this and that and the other listen focus on the Word of God it will never fail you never I failed it many times but it's never failed me once I go to it hey man never has it failed me alright so in in baby form justification yes you can fall you can still be lost but when this justification comes in talking about the seal when you see there's one true and living God you know that it's names the Lord Jesus Christ you know that you're not talking to a third person that has to talk to a second that needs to talk to a first and what's inside you it's not a third person because most people think well yeah I got the Holy Ghost well who is that like the third person of the Trinity no no it's eternal God eternal God so don't worry about the salt like I said before watch the redemption redemption pull it back up one more time the break in the seals is not necessarily for the soul the soul is redeemed by the new birth what we were just talking about because you can't understand any further what we're talking about unless you're born again like brother down same thing see we're marrying this thing together he's preaching on this I'm preaching on this but it's basically the same thing you got to be born again and at faith before you can add any of that you got to be born again before you can add any of this we might the problem this is problem number one problem sure was okay we're boarding in but I don't think I'm good enough you never thought that before well you need to take a body change then go that's our problem what we do is what we make lists just ran a canard we make lists we list I did this I didn't do that I can't do this I can't do that get rid of them list get rid of the list list that's why I listen that's why we think whoa the seals is the greatest message sure it is but listen if Jesus Christ was the seal he was all of them he was a seventh seal he was all the seal amen he preached a simple message that common people heard him gladly so it's not this great mystery sure the mystery was to the outside people you a man make yourself God no it was God they'd made itself into a man amen pretty simple that's the same thing with the seals that's why the thunder of the seal was not some mysterious thing but he had it so mysterious to his head from everybody because remember dawn was getting ready to write it down the full plan of redemption John knew listen John knew when he wrote revelations five john weeped right john wept why john knew he was born again john knew he was born again he knew that that man that walked on the shores of Galilee was now inside of him but he still didn't think yourself worthy he still didn't think itself worthy who is worthy to open the book but when John saw Jesus take the book and then saw his name in that book he identified with that and remember he stopped crying and he started shouting and the whole everything hurt him from heaven to earth what a thunder while thunder that was the voice of God right through John worthy like I said before when Jesus took that book from the hand of the one sitting on the throne that book was already worthy he had paid the price he was just what getting the title deed back that Adam had lost Adam had the ability to bring us to pass no words he had the book okay when I look now look that book though was transferred from Adam back to who God the Father and then when the fall happened when God comes down in the garden and says I'll put enmity what do you do he drew a division or a chasm that man can't get back this away and God can't get this way at the moment then he set up bulls and goats so that they could converse but it's not full fellowship but he did give them away he did give them a example in the Old Testament I'm coming I will put enmity or division between what thy seed the seed of the woman he put a division there but when Christ came heaven and earth kids can brought it right back together hey men brought it right back together and you say oh that was God in human flesh that's exactly what Adam was before the fall now sure he was still after the fall but remember Adams carnal mind is what killed him compartmentalize it it wasn't his flesh his flesh only was motivated by what he was thinking his soul was the soul of God he was a son of garden he put he turned life into Adam soul but there was a spirit realm that what Adam do Adam stepped out of that he stepped out of that his step out of his soul but you understand what he stepped out of that realm and he began to reason in his spirit that's our problem we reason in that spirit realm we reason that we can't understand these things because it's so great no simple plan of redemption Redemption Redemption Redemption but this is what God wants I was thinking yesterday in that fourth church age that's where we're at now with the with the second seal we're on the fourth church age there had to be a time that they had to go in the ground all right I will restore now what do you do he watch now look Peter on the day of Pentecost when he said this is that this the Prophet Joel spoked I will restore the years of but now remember he was prophesying because the because the corn of wheat had wit in the ground yes sure Jesus did Jesus was the first fruit but remember here they started as a full mature church then it went in the ground and Nicaea which is right here we're going to talk about that in a few minutes right here because they suffered that woman Jezebel that was a jazz about religion come somebody able to preach a sermon now brother Bram did a good job with Jezebel religion he didn't get y'all with Allah but what he was showing he was showing that in that fourth church days they're gonna accept because remember this horse was white the horse we're talking about now is red same man he just got on a different ministry he just got on a different power so that he could ride through but you know what he was doing he was full well into very plan and purpose of Almighty God they had to go in the ground here why so that they can come back up because you don't start with a full grain of wheat you have to bury that grain of wheat then you have to bring two shoes listen the plan of God never changes that's why I like it planned God never changes even when you walk out here and plant something in the garden it don't come up seed first right it starts in a process of two ships then a stalk then a tassel and then at the end when you come out to the very end my apple trees are just mad my bees are doing a good job they really pollinating those apples and I got pear trees I mean yeah pears hanging like this and plums too but you know what the tree has the life but when that tree gets finished all that life is going to be in the plums and the apples and in the pears why because that's the fruit and that's what you and I are supposed to be bringing we're supposed to be bringing forth what fruit meat for repentance fruit that is that's what Jesus says Jesus was the master sower he had to sow the seed of the word not a seed because the sees the Word of God listen it's always been laying him and then we just got put in good ground give us some water give us some sunshine and guess what let God do is you know you know you have to stay you don't have to stand out there and say now now corn you got to start with just two shoes and then you come back about three weeks later and you say oh good now you need us no you don't have to tell it anything the law of God was put in motion when he said I'll put enmity that's the whole plan that's the whole plan you're lost and I'm gonna come and I'm gonna bridge the chasm and when I bridge chasm then you know what it's not this look at me it's not this Romans 8 says we are white heirs and joint-heirs whatever Christ gets we get you know what that's not me saying it the Bible says that that's our problem sometimes we read the Bible we go man I believe that and then you really look at and you say maybe I don't maybe I don't can I see myself doing that God didn't ask you he told you this is the way it's going to be hey man I was thinking about the other day but white throne judgment we were talking about something me and somebody but you need to come to the White Throne judgment the people who come up to the white throne judgment are going to be judged by their words boy but you're gonna have to go through all those if you're not born again you got to stand for that white throne judgment and you're gonna have to be judged by your words what you did and man because look those who is justified he's already glorified you and I are shielded completely from that completely no judgment why don't I make you happy when that first seal open that that's what showed me that God has took everything everything I mean everything oh yeah we have up days and down days what in this in the spirit realm but that soul of God listen when a saint walks across the curtain of time what a power he saw their dead know they just don't reside in the flesh you used to see their more live now than he ever was [Applause] and what listen once we see now that even though we are dying in the flesh we'd buy the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the opening of the word are more alive we're that crystal that God can turn the channel in the whole world can hear us because listen I'm gonna read you the quote this afternoon the bride because brother Brian picks it up the listen the first seal is super important the second seal is super important this third seal we're coming to is super super important we'll talk about this afternoon super super important because even on that third seal brother Branham says the bride hadn't had a revival yet so guess what you know what yeah we have individual revivals then we have individual PD parties amen been to those a few don't get an invitation I just go myself I don't have to have an invitation to go to a pity party no I just walk right on into it but the whole break the bride as a whole has never looked bad the bride as a whole has never been oh well people are leaving the message and it ain't bride bottom line they're not bright but you know let God do that let word we're like you said let's hone this thing let's get all this stuff out of the way and watch God because like I said when we come up to the see when we get to the third seal we're getting closer to the rapture rapture hot happens on the fourth seal amen so we're getting closer to the time of of body change and then getting out of here and to me that's super important Amen because remember it's going to have to be something supernatural because nobody ever done it no ever done it you say oh well you just said nobody ever done I said nobody's ever done it yet nobody's ever done it yet but we which are alive and remain I think we ought to put that somewhere on the wall we which are alive and remain my name is we listen what is our problem from the time of Adam we have disconnected from God have not had full fellowship until Jesus walked on the earth and it was only in one man but now that man the first fruit it's now inside of you what does that make you right here will bring full fellowship into manifestation and listen it's not I'm going to pray that God would give you this the Bible says if ye say to this mountain the biggest mountain we are ever going to face is death I don't know why I'm going this way bein the biggest mountain is death you show I'm worried about my job you bury work about death that's your biggest mountain and if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart then it will happen that mountain will be moved but you can't do it as a baby can't do it as a baby up here I'm not saying a baby up here because you say that to a baby you feed that meat to a baby and it'll choke it amen it's slow wait a minute its food its food but food put in the wrong place will choke you amen so we got to be mature listen we have got to come to a place that like brother Brown said one time he said you job won't matter anything to you you got to even say your family it's you you know Jesus was so loving and kind he said if you don't forsake your mother your father your sister and your brother and follow me he said you'll have no part in his kingdom Wow somebody walked up and said no Jesus I need to bury my uncle and then I'll come with you in another day or two he said let the dead bury the dead you know what he was doing he was getting rid of the foolishness let the dead bury the dead listen if they're dead there's nothing you can do about it anyway like daddy always said we something we've talked about hunting one time and this guy's didn't want to walk through this graveyard they just said daddy said it was actually Daniel Wyatt he said Daniel he said them dead ones won't hurt you he said it's the live ones that will hurt you profound so don't worry about the dead ones it's the live ones that'll urge you alright so look we got to get to the second seal cuz they got to finish it now we know that the seals is a plan of redemption right it's what we just been talking about redeem redeem means to what bring back so we're trying to bring back full fellowship now listen let's be honest we fellowship with the devil a lot let's just be honest we fellowship with the devil a lot in other words he tells you something and you go well maybe maybe Bob did look at me kind of wrong another day you shake my hand that's for sure I think I'll just mark him off all right you know why and you say well you can't help those thoughts from coming you can but I have come to the conclusion that 99% of the things that you think are worthless and 1% is when God talks to you and that's worth something hey man he's all of that don't worry about that worry about we which are alive and remain worried about though we all right then okay because remember the full fellowship is not always with the brother and sister the full fellowship is with God and then when you get full fellowship with God that'll put you in fellowship with the brotherly kindness the man where you love somebody whether they don't like you're not a man and truly love them now look I truly love them not put on amen because you know what put on is if you put on that's the devil because the devil put on all this show to destroy the church all this horse riding and bow gathering and sword getting and it's all the devil's planned of what derail the Christian not to derail the sinner he's got them already but he feels the power I want to preach on that maybe in another month or so when we get finished with this the power that lays inside a Christian and I said lays because most of time we don't use it if we lay something down we're not using it amen but the power that we've been given but what is Satan done Satan says no I don't think you can do that you're not good enough well you know what Satan those who he's justified he's already glorified just leave me alone but we come to this one right here we come to the second seal and we we've been on it for a little while so let's the breaking of the seal remember it's not the white horse and the red horse it's what's underneath it and man go to tell you what just go ahead to review and we'll skip the two the two other quotes was about the the line ox man and I mean about the the first seal second seal third steal in a force field that was just the seal that was tore off what happened was is is satanist what he's done he's just throat all these things up he even got people to believe that the wild horse rider was a Holy Ghost that wasn't God did did that God can't deny his word or go against it so anything false doctrine wives never come from God so compartmentalize that move it out of the way if it's false doctrine it didn't come from God and it's not even worth to be talked about and then but review their sanctification under the seal clean and set aside for service that's what these things do so as we come through not baby form sanctification but a sanctification in the pyramid where what I'm shoveling out impatience well the deal will cover this hey I'm shoveling out in PI am shoveling out impatient so that God can give me patience I love that quote from Dwight Moody somebody made it the other day said he said God will only fill those who are not full of theirself amen profound God will only fill those who are not full of their self why because if you full of self there's no room for God but see this makes room because look this guy I'm going to say this guy this this anointing is already in you the Ox anointing the man anointing see when we get to that man anointing look that's not man's knowledge and that man anointing is not human man that's intelligence of God amen cover this afternoon going into the next seal but see Satan had to do that Satan had to bring it up to where that the intelligence of man were getting away but right in the middle that what God's raising up by Reformation my brother they'll remember but it is part of restoration because remember the Reformers can only go so far right because Martin Luther's justification listen you can't smoke a pipe and drink a beer and be in the body of Christ today but they could because they only they had a narrow view remember remember one thing for sure look at where Martin Luther was he was in the Catholic Church pennis try to beat these things I love me one day you know what he done one day God revealed that one scripture Martin Luther you can't justify yourself but if I justify you you live by that faith that I did the work remember he was a prophet I believe God came to me and said look forget penance forget all these things I saved you because you believed of Who I am and God was pleased with that then we come more what to sanctification where now we don't smoke him we don't drink we don't do the things that are the little frivolous things that that maybe Martin Luther did and got by with it because it wasn't the word for that day okay just widen even though they were that's what's so stranger's is they were writing the word at the time you know putting it together during Martin Luther's time Tyndale and all those people we're writing the word and putting it together but Martin Luther saw to just shall live by faith in see the rest of this he saw that but you know what God said okay I'll start right there because I got to build my church back up a man because the church went down here then it's got to come back up in this age and this age come here then alright say Amen alright so the Red Horse remember red is white red the red power of the Red Horse go to the next one the red power of the Red Horse was what to kill and what did he do he physically killed Satan what listen Satan got in the church and did the killing that's what you better pay attention to right now Satan got in the church and did the killing and then he didn't bring some barbarian from from Norway or the Netherlands and some big Viking didn't come up and kill all the Christians no he did it right there in their own yard the decree came from the very church that God had established you hear what I said God had established Satan said I think I'll just slide on into this one I'll kill 68 million listen Satan wants to kill all of us Satan's job is to kill what seek and destroy he wants to destroy all of us when we had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see which was the Ox now the options of burden bear he's not real pretty I've never seen a real pretty ox but you know what God thought enough of that spirit of the Ox of the labor and the burden and the pulling and the things that he'd done that's what happened in that church age because remember anybody that said they were a Christian that's 168 million them got killed and at that time Satan was so closing that's in that fourth age till you couldn't hardly tell I mean look here comes the Crusaders with crosses on their backs and on their shields telling you if you don't see it my way then that Satan if you don't see it my way I'm gonna kill you so he physically killed Christians that same spirit moved right over into Eichmann and Hitler and still living today still wanting to kill all those people over there over there now and remember a yesterday or day before yesterday remember was the 70th year of the Israel being a nation there since pretty significant but that's not for us I'm s for them that's professed for that we just watch those things cause remember when if nothing can happen spiritually listen to me nothing can happen spirit we'll get to that later on in the seal because there's something coming up there in the sixth seal but the Jews nothing nothing you hear me God cannot now listen he can work but he can't deal with the Jews while he's dealing with us amen so so we watch Israel we look at the times because remember remember jesus said the parable of the fig tree so they're living a parable at the moment because we're here comes remember he's not a parable to us he's a reality then he's going to walk when we get out of the way he's not going to be a parable to the Jews he's going to become a reality to them amen and then he's going to save them can't save us both at the same time amen so now look compartmentalize that don't worry about the Jews don't worry about the world don't worry about the denomination worry about what you're doing here amen and when I mean worry I don't mean worry about biting your fingernails worrying I don't do that you shouldn't do that okay you should what you should watch be vigilant and be careful but don't fear how you gonna fear if you're already sealing in with God Bible says what are you gonna fear what the man do to the body he said you better fear the man that can do something with your soul amen why are we here we're here not to be like God that's our problem and I don't mind that someone to be like Jesus that's okay we need that we need be more like him but I thought if that same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he will quicken your mortal body by that spirit that dwells in you we'll get to that in Romans downstairs in a little bit I like the book of Romans it's really good book good book to read but here we come we got here and then went out another horse that was red and power was given him look power was given he had no power and then God permitted him to do these things what to fulfill his word kornel he's got to go in the ground and power was given him that sat down to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another kill one another and that was given unto him a great sword or a great word amen now let's see what that word does that word in the fourth church age-wise we're going to read revelations 2 verse 18 cuz I'm telling you God allowed this to happen go to the next one there you go unto the angel of church the thigh tyre now that's the fourth church age right then alright this is the fourth eighth word and look we're talking lap overs here but still that that middle church age was like a thousand or so years it was the longest one God let it go and let it go and into the angel of church the thought I'll write these things saith the son of God who has his eyes likened to flame a fire at his feet fine brass I know thy works and charity and service and faith in thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because remember he had bride in that age so we had to give him a blessing he has to bless his children and man thought you know why cuz he said he would God has to do things because he already said he was gonna do hey man we can't demand God do something just read the word he already wrote it we don't have to demand him to save my children he said in Isaiah 66 you'll be there with y'all for an offspring right mmm so I just rest on that that's see that's my rest I'm not gonna bite my fingernails I'm a rest on what he said notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and look seduced My servants Wow seduce my servants to commit fornication because remember Father Son and Holy Ghost I read it to you nothing long ago was formulated in hell remember it did not come from God amen my servants to commit fornication and eat things sacrificed unto idols because look if you baptize that's why brother Bram said all these things he's talking about casting out demons in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost in the demon just stays there there's no power in that but look Satan put it so much as an idol till they believed it you said Oh eat things like no I'm talking about baptism the name of Father Son Holy Ghost Trinitarian doctrine that was all from Jezebel you said she never preached that yes she did she's gonna kill the prophets she was going to she demanded to kill Elijah amen and she got her own church together and thought she could do what she said she was gonna do but she never did why because God killed her and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and then they committed adultery with her into Great Tribulation now that's the denominational world I'll read it to you brother Bram said that's the reason in the third churches he said I see now why I'm so against organized religion because that's what he done to him it gave them idols they committed fornication you remember when brother Branham was discerning that man remember the man walked through the room and he desert it as as adultery against his wife and he went to that brother and he found out then it was more clear when he got to talking to the brother picked up his spirit it wasn't that spirit of committing adultery physically he was what'd he say leaning toward organized religion same spirit and then same spirit behold I will cast her into a bed and then the committed adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death now God said that God said that devil didn't say that God said that I will kill her children with death and all the church don't know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your what works but unto you I say unto the rest and time tires many has have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none of the burden they just made it through that listen they didn't have a statue of a perfect man to listen to sermon they didn't have a sealed sermon to listen to you they just believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and they were saved amen but that which you have already hold fast till I come and he that overcometh keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nations and then we keep on reading but just going through now I want to get to a point right here so what did God what did Satan do Satan changed his doctrine Satan's always changing his doctrine he's changing his doctrine he has a ministry of this in a ministry of light and hey he's got 960 some of them well that was when brother Brown was here there's like 13 thousands of nominations now they can't all be of God and then their Creed is not from God their denominational idea under their denominational idea at this moment it's no good that's why when you get up into the seal see here we go we compartmentalize you can't be an adult denomination and know this message and be safe you just can't the door shut somewhere I believe that's what happened in 1977 instead of us going in a rapture I believe in 1977 God shut the door he said I'm not dealing with his father son Holy Ghost baptism anymore I'm not dealing with this Trinitarian doctrine anymore of course remember there were people during brother Browns time like I said he preached to Trinitarians a lot probably 90% of the people in there in the service were Trinitarian God winked at that ignorance but there come a time when brother Brown said now bride I'm talking to you God said bride I'm talking to you it's in the days of the voice of the seventh angel amen which is right now so this is who he's talking to when you match play'd God's talking to you not somebody else he's talking to you right so he changed this doctrine he changed his tactics he's fixing to change it again though because when we get into the black horse he's going to change it again he's going to bring out a new doctrine brother Brown sent an old trend and you try to become out of the new Trinity you know what the new Trinity is ain't gonna say it not only somebody happens to do with a couple of people that are still alive well you figured out I mean they they brother branham was God and Joseph God please people yeah where God made manifest in another form but we're not God himself there's a big difference brother Brown said if you call me what Jesus Christ that makes me Antichrist let's just stop right there all right amen let's get through some of this because I want to finish go to quote number four now remember when the unclean spirit goes out of a man that sanctification that's clean and set aside for service like we were talking about oh you're sitting on the front row today where does that that black always in the back well nevermind I'm gonna use you daddy get behind me get behind me Satan when the unclean spirit goes out of a man you ain't clean thing now that happened before you were born again they meant to start with baby form sanctification just to cover something real quick but now what happened was is in baby form sanctification if you don't fill it with the Holy Ghost it comes right back in and he hides deeper than he hid before and then that's why the sanctification process is so dangerous to stay there because he didn't come back as an unclean spirit like you went out he came back more smart more subtle oh you got the Holy Ghost you believe the message don't you you have to holy go yeah you got the Holy Ghost but boy there's some things you really can do you know you do some things that nobody know cuz you hid see but no we're not talking about that when an unclean spirit goes out and then the Holy Spirit comes in there's no room for that unclean spirit that's in your soul compartmentalize that's in your soul amen but now when you're born in you've still got things you got to worry about temper see right there you need virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness now when that goes out he's still working on me see the Bible says even Paul says I die daily well that's what it is the daily killing now sometimes you let that thing come back but it's in the spirit realm but remember in the spirit in Sedona in this please don't get comfortable but remember in the spirit realm listen to me in this in the in the soul of you there is no lie no deceit it's the Word of God that all right if you're born again today and your soul is God brother Brown said you and God in there as persons all right but now in that spirit realm God comes in and he works but Satan comes in and he works because you're still living in a dual world is that okay because remember remember one thing's for sure Satan can't get in your soul if you're born again so he can't deceive you in your soul but then he can water down in that spirit realm make you lean member brother Brian preach that wonderful sermon lean not to what your own understanding all right that's our problem we have we have come to where man has told us even in the denominational world and coming right over the message that that there's such a crust on that soul that it can't work well I can't help you know like I said before I I still hate I just can't stand it is what it is cuz it ain't what it ain't can I say that yeah I still hate it is what it is because it ain't what it ain't okay because you know it is what it is puts you in the grave because you know what grandma died mama died daddy died right here the womb of our mind we got to be changed a man goes listen be honest with yourself if you're born again in your soul there's no death nothing in your soul tells you you don't die nothing there's no death in God off we believe that you got to keep cultivating that though go Satan sitting are you gonna die don't argue with him either because he'll win because you know what he's gonna do you're gonna say no I can't die I'm not gonna die he said someone chose in the grave didn't say no devil I got your answer buddy he's hiding from you God has hid him from you but he'll be back or she'll be back amen I love that we're joke says hide me hide me till the storm goes by hide me in other words put me in a place where nothing can bother me I mean you think they're worried about something in the sixth dimension you think they're worried there is no worry there there is no fear listen whatever is in that sixth dimension is the same power in this dimension that's something we go up there over there and we're over here they got the same Holy Ghost you got and they're over there waiting on us to cast out the fear you and I are the blood we read this last Sunday we are the blood by the spirit the bride of Jesus Christ his blood relation to him a blood-bought bride remember Adam and Eve like I said before take Adam and Eve and put them in a put them in a hospital and let them draw blood from Adam and go to the next room and draw blood for me do a DNA test and they'll swear that one person that's why we'll have a body locking to his glorious body but we got to believe that now look blood relation a blood ball bride no wonder she was led by the spirit there is a connection coming together there's a union coming together that's the reason I think today that the born-again listen the Holy Ghost filled people is connected with God and are led by the Spirit of God that's why they act so peculiar to people they've made their decisions they're going to go on out regardless if the rest of them don't go out they're going out anyway I like that don't care if this one walks this way listen don't care for I don't listen you got to come to a point to where if this whole church leaves a message are you gonna just leave and follow no there's a top post they don't keep you here I mean not here physically hearing this message because listen if the Holy Ghost can feed only on the word amen only on the word then if this is the word they kind of connect why the life is in the blood and the life is in the church the Christian that's born again by the Spirit of God that's the spirit of life blood relation to Christ the Spirit of Christ in the blood of Christ leading a child of Christ the seed of Abraham that's why they move peculiar you're a little bit elite that's one of the world thinks so strange of them let's go to the next one Christ is a mystery we're a distant lest last Sunday it by all rights amen all right watch redeemed by Christ the second Adam so remember whatever the first Adam lost its back I'm not saying it's coming back its back amen cuz remember anything that goes on this world like I was saying before about Hawaii in all those places anything's going on in this world is because of you and me birth pains this world is groaning to get back up right the animals are groaning to get back up right why cuz this is not subtle this is not supposed to happen amen I told them out in Arizona and I'll tell you you know we think we here we go let's compartmentalize this remember one thing's for sure once would we still live in this flesh body and man we still live in this flesh body and it's gonna get weak and it's going to get sick and it's gonna get different things don't worry about that it's just not so you wake up in the morning it's not supposed to be you eating a meal cuz you have to it's not supposed to be you doing all the other function that we don't want to talk about that should have never happened so put that out of the way don't worry about what why is my buddy don't worry about it don't worry about what your body's saying cuz remember it's always contrary to God always cuz it wasn't supposed to be but the groaning is from the inside wanting to get that man back a wretched man that I am you just keep going we'll read it later on that's Christ in the church today taking his wife back see the threefold mystery now God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church all together to bring back the original Adam and Eve again men and woman which are one made of the same blood and same spirit and everything else the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes an end the body that recognizes only his body as Fletcher's word now look if you're already been baptized by the Holy Ghost if you already been born again what's he talking about I die daily it comes back to this right here you see that right there that's where people they they have them you know they have a brain burp you can't have all this and then get the Holy Ghost up here you got to have the Holy Ghost down here to respond to that thing that's bringing you up that's molding it together where you used to worry about something you used to have a temper lord I love it listen to me I love it when I see things that were wrong in my life and they're not there anymore now you need to realize that you said oh you're special you're a preacher please people Lord we have more problems than y'all do if the devil kills us he's got you hello what the devil gets us he's got you because you can't go no higher on your pastor you can leave him go somewhere else so Satan hates us I'm heat you know right now you know who's listening in my brain who's listening ain't nobody listening to you they're looking off into space they're staring off into the Holy Ghost we'll listen to what the Holy Ghost says every time the church is the blood so I don't worry about those things I really don't it bothers me because that's why you know it's why brother Brown had a complex he had a complex why the ever complex cuz he could see he could see who was not just think he could see and I'm not pointing to you sister well you I am he could know really he could see a black shadow come up out of a person they said man they ain't getting it or are they come and shake his hand and he knows there's a knife coming in the back I couldn't do it he's the only man on this earth that could ever take that and guarding you that that's why he's the Prophet amen he's characteristic you and I couldn't do that be honest that's the baptism how would you be looking out in the audience of people going you see this demon pop-up now you see the Holy Ghost too but you see this thing pop his head up you know he said you look like a bat or a cat or something like that you know her well I like the one where he I don't like it but remember he tried to describe one the devil's now I'm talking about the realm he lived in that what was it the what demon was it looked like the that old cartoon Ali he said some demon whatever it was looked just like that I told him he saw demons it look like that but now thank God you and I don't want to see that we see enough with expressions on faces don't need a don't need a black cat selling your shoulder when I conceive or this is what I like to sit the whole service me the Hmong people face the Spirit of God inside of you you're alive and at least it will respond at least say amen to something that's about giving the Holy Spirit that baptizes us into the body that recognizes only his body his flesh is his word like I said compartmentalize it only recognize you word for the day your word for the day is go to the statue of a perfect man these things are what required so that's a requirement in this age so we must come to the statue of a perfect man we must I'm just going to say it we're gonna have to see understand more than anybody even the Apostle even the disciples because they all look to a glass darkly they all looked and knew something was coming but here it is this is what they saw and it was it was you know Paul said I looked through a glass darkly but man group of people they can see clear why because we've got foundation amen all right let's go to adoption let's go to number seven let's read this and I want you to read we're gonna read this from then we'll quit this will be the end right here watch don't you watch but a real spirit-filled Church full of the power of God sitting together in heavenly places this is 1960 we should be further up the road sitting together in heavenly places offering spiritual sacrifices praises of God the holy spirit moving among them discerning sin calling out the things that's among them that's wrong straightened out and making it flat and level because why always in the presence of God is that bloody sacrifice now remember we went through it this morning you wasn't saved by the blood that's right you were saved by the life in the blood I mean but you're kept saved by the blood what that daily washing washing out all the trash like sister Sheppard's dreaming blasphemous name washing all the trash out being born again I died daily and all these things second Timothy Paul says if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified and meat for the Masters use and prepared unto every good work that's pretty neat huh but you were saved by grace through faith believing it God knocked at your heart because he predestinated you you looked up and believed it and accepted it now the blood makes an atonement for your sins listen to this remember I said God does not condemn a sinner for sinning all right he's a sinner to begin with he condemns a Christian for sinning now look compartmentalizing you don't send in your soul you don't send in your body your body's just a product of sin it's only motivated by what's inside and then because he has condemned him Christ took our condemnation so there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walked out after the flesh but after the spirit and if you do anything wrong it isn't willfully you don't sin willfully now if you sin wilfully you're not born again that's what he says a man that sins willfully goes out and willfully sins never come into that buddy yet but a man that's once in there he's dead and that's what we're getting to that next seal the next seal is what black death all right and his life is hitting God through Christ he said why didn't did happen in this them in this church is part of it did but the death that we're fixing to talk about is not physical death I'd rather die physically than to be dead spiritually amen I'd rather be dead physically than to be dead spiritually because there's a lot of people that's dead and don't know it amen but a man that's once in there he's dead and his life is hitting God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost and the devil can't even find him he's so far back in there now what brother branham say said if you and the devil get into a conversation what have you done you have stepped out into his ground his ground is memory reason conscience affection imagination you've took him stepped out of the realm into his realm all right and the devil can't even find him he's so far back in there he would have to come out of there before the devil can ever get in for you or dead man you are dead that's what we're going to get to next the next one next seal we're coming to is the black horse death and we'll see how that all fits in the brothers and sisters that second seal is you dine you dine but let God do the killing let God kill that thing amen let's stand our feet let God kill that thing you know that song I surrender all you know we was saying I surrender on we do this you walk up to a guy with a gun and you say I surrender he's gonna shoot you because you're not surrendering he don't know what's in this hand but when you got both arms up and you got them palms up in the air it's a lot more safe to say I surrender because there's nothing else that you're keeping in hiding from God he loves Lord we gotta love his word we gotta feed off of it that's the whole thing on these seals it's not something that's just it's not mysterious folks it's just everyday life it's overcoming he that overcometh he that overcometh he that overcometh so you know what when God said you can overcome he put a provision in there for you to overcome whoa stop stop that's what we got to stop doing well he don't under don't tell me an eternal God don't understand what he knows what you gonna go through before you go through it there's no surprise he never has enough moment oh he never says well I shouldn't have done that to brother Donny know whatever happened to him if he's a child of God God meant for it to happen and he knew what would happen in the outcome that's what I have to believe that way you can go through problems in your life and you can say God I am your child don't don't don't God why did you do this to me why not forget that it's for a reason the reason he knows but remember one thing it's still your choice so I love what brother Dale said nothing long ago God knew every Avenue that you could have took if you hadn't have been this is that you understand predestination we say boys just thought pull you through a tube now brother Ram said that's not the way it was so it's not stamped sure in God's mind it is so they knew what you do before you did it but remember God's nose are the best yeses you will ever get but if you think oh god I got this thing figured out if I could just and you see this wall come up or God says no you don't need to do that you know what you can press yourself into it and make a foolish mistake but if you listen to that know that God knew that if you went on through with it that's why you need to pray about everything you do anything you do job life life family whatever because if God said no then he knows that you if you went down that path you would go wrong he can't let a child of God go wrong if you do it the right way you hear what I said one more time he can't let a child of God go wrong if you'll do it the right way go to God seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and all these other things what will be added to you let's see God bless you the second seal it was good I like sanctification it just gives you a good washing we come every Sunday for a good watch it would come every Wednesday we match play for a good wash [Music] you were for the valley you were born for the sky don't let you trials get you down or drive your spirit around now tap your way [Music] we'll make heel to this truffle

own brother Amit born for let's go get them okay you know okay so Satan whatever you've done going on Lord we pray that you would just touch our sisterhood and give us strength and get rid of that headache in the name of Jesus Christ for your honor and glory amen our sisters wrote this thing away and we believe in the name of Jesus Christ if you touch our sister lording heated Jesus name we pray amen yes sir understanding for his day we pray the food this treasure be rewarded healing father thank you for these child white face that you brought up let's go [Applause] so I love all this

in their head having our head is not in their head maybe we gotta revert back to that chili [Music] you are not smiling here aboard for the sky that's where we're going try into the ground we're not going what a minute now to hear but you know why we're gonna have all fine before we get out of here we're gonna defeat Satan in this very evening he's created actually created he just this is all gone you know what God your God give it to you go take control we have control we just don't realize god bless you you're dismissed come back in two o'clock we'll start on the third seal which keep us
