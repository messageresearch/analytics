[29:53] amen
[29:54] he would there is a
[29:57] um
[30:00] brother that made a uh thing of
[30:02] his or her brother tim humes the last
[30:04] time they made it
[30:05] but you can go on your internet and pull
[30:07] up gary walker
[30:09] and it is a good i believe
[30:13] all around uh
[30:15] testimony and it's not just a testimony
[30:18] of this that or the
[30:20] other it is a good preaching service i
[30:23] thought he done a real good job
[30:25] of explaining explaining a lot of things
[30:28] and if you'd like to
[30:29] to listen to it you know or to see it
[30:33] go on to there and you can download it
[30:34] and
[30:35] see it and i would encourage you because
[30:37] i think it was good amen just remember
[30:40] sister mary
[30:41] uh brother dougherty was back there a
[30:42] minute ago and i see she's gone back to
[30:45] the restroom so remember her that
[30:48] the lord would would uh
[30:50] touch her because she was sick there for
[30:52] a little bit okay hebrews 6
[30:57] therefore leaving the principles of the
[30:59] doctrine of christ
[31:00] that is going to perfection not laying
[31:02] again the foundation of repentance from
[31:04] dead works
[31:06] and of faith toward god
[31:09] and of the doctrine of the doctrine of
[31:11] baptisms and of laying on of hands and
[31:14] of resurrection of the dead and of
[31:16] eternal judgment
[31:18] this will we do if god permit
[31:22] all right now let's go back to
[31:25] let's go to second corinthians
[31:31] 12 and we'll just read the first four
[31:32] verses
[31:35] it is not expedient
[31:38] for me doubtless to glory i will come to
[31:41] visions and revelations of the lord
[31:43] i knew a man in the spirit above 14
[31:45] years ago whether in the body i cannot
[31:48] tell or whether
[31:50] out of the body i cannot tell god
[31:52] knoweth
[31:53] such in one caught up to the third
[31:56] heaven
[31:57] and i knew such a man whether in the
[31:59] body or out of the body i cannot tell
[32:01] god knoweth
[32:03] how that he was caught up into paradise
[32:06] and heard unspeakable words which is not
[32:08] lawful for a man to utter you may be
[32:11] seated the lord had his blessing
[32:13] to the reading of the word
[32:21] pull off my whole rig
[32:26] i hope you
[32:28] you know caught what i've talked about
[32:30] this morning understood
[32:32] and to be able to follow with me
[32:35] as to that's all right it'll stay in my
[32:38] pocket
[32:39] but uh
[32:41] you know
[32:43] we're talking about dead works
[32:46] now paul mentions that i said there in
[32:50] in
[32:51] hebrews 6
[32:52] and he also brings it out in hebrews 9.
[32:56] and in no way in the world is he calling
[32:59] the word of god
[33:01] dead works
[33:03] all right now that's i hope that's
[33:05] settled at least for you to know that i
[33:08] don't believe he is i believe he's
[33:10] bringing it out
[33:12] the way that the prophet of god brought
[33:15] the message unto us
[33:17] to show us that we constantly need to go
[33:21] on
[33:22] and not to stop you know
[33:24] because if we do then we will dry up and
[33:27] die
[33:28] and we must continue on
[33:31] and if we are not the group i believe we
[33:33] are but if we are not the group that
[33:36] will be there at the change of the body
[33:39] then
[33:40] we will be going on as much as we can
[33:42] and someone else will have to take over
[33:44] and go on because it is not a dead thing
[33:47] of setting steel
[33:49] this is a continual moving of the spirit
[33:52] of god the prophet of god said that the
[33:55] pillar of fire behind the veil
[33:58] said it was constantly moving
[34:01] you know
[34:02] because he said it's a lights and
[34:04] actions and things that it was
[34:06] constantly moving god does not stop
[34:10] he keeps on going so i hope you can
[34:12] follow what i'm
[34:14] was trying to say
[34:16] that
[34:18] dead works is not just life and things
[34:21] like that we look at it that way that's
[34:23] automatically we know that's dead works
[34:26] but the very word that we receive
[34:29] can become dead unto us
[34:32] if we don't take that and step out onto
[34:35] the next step and keep moving on now
[34:38] if you didn't hear the morning message i
[34:40] pray that you will you know
[34:42] hear that and continue on to see what
[34:45] we're talking about because paul was
[34:48] calling
[34:49] the beginnings or principles
[34:52] as dead works and brother random called
[34:54] it dead works but now
[34:56] he wasn't calling it something dead like
[34:58] we call it
[34:59] but it's just the fact that if we stop
[35:01] any work
[35:05] in our christian journey
[35:07] then we've got a problem
[35:09] you know we've got a problem so just
[35:11] let's continue on let's examine
[35:14] ourselves as the scripture says
[35:16] and see if we're in the faith
[35:19] in the faith of this hour you say well
[35:21] we're in the message
[35:22] the message can become dead works for
[35:25] you and i if we don't continue on and
[35:28] make that message manifest
[35:31] in
[35:32] you and i in the new birth i believe
[35:35] that now and that's my goal that's what
[35:37] i'm talking about all right
[35:40] now we read then too that
[35:43] you know when spoke just a little that
[35:46] paul said there in verse three i think
[35:49] it is in
[35:50] the scriptures
[35:51] in
[35:52] uh
[35:54] hebrews
[35:55] that
[35:56] we would continue on if god permits
[36:00] well
[36:01] he didn't permit paul to continue
[36:05] right you know all the way
[36:07] right right all right
[36:09] but one time he did permit paul to be
[36:12] caught up right
[36:14] and to see the things you know
[36:17] that would be in glory and even things
[36:20] that he said he was not even able to
[36:22] speak about
[36:23] now brother random was caught up
[36:26] and uh he went to as he said himself he
[36:30] said paul went to the third heaven he
[36:32] said i believe i went to the first
[36:34] heaven
[36:36] and caught up you know and saw things
[36:38] and come back
[36:39] and done it remember
[36:41] uh moses
[36:43] was taken up and shown how to make the
[36:46] uh the in the mount and shown how to
[36:49] make the the tent the the things that he
[36:52] had to make all of the
[36:54] utensils and everything he was shown how
[36:56] to make those things
[36:58] and uh you know that would be uh
[37:01] something of caught up because we're
[37:03] going to talk about
[37:05] how that the rapture
[37:08] i told you i would when i get on over i
[37:11] mentioned it part of the way
[37:13] but i want to talk about it today and
[37:14] this is the faith faith for the time
[37:17] number three but you can put you another
[37:19] title to it that the rapture is in you
[37:22] all right now we want to speak about
[37:24] that for a little while and and see but
[37:26] i want to ask you a question to begin
[37:29] with
[37:30] while everybody is attentive to at least
[37:32] the point not asleep you know
[37:34] or
[37:35] trying to figure out how to get home in
[37:36] a hurry or whatever
[37:39] i want to ask you a question
[37:41] are you in the rapture people i've heard
[37:43] this ever since
[37:45] uh back in the beginning when we came
[37:47] into the message and people would say
[37:50] we're in the rapture
[37:54] well now are we in the rapture
[37:57] or is the rapture in us
[38:01] now
[38:02] uh to be in the rapture
[38:05] would mean
[38:06] that you know and i didn't agree with
[38:08] their approach back then
[38:11] as to what i understood some to be
[38:13] saying
[38:14] that uh it's kind of like we're in the
[38:17] millennium you know
[38:19] and uh things like that
[38:21] and i didn't agree with that
[38:24] and i asked that question there are we
[38:27] in the rapture or is the rapture in us
[38:29] right you know because i want to i want
[38:32] to definitely as believers
[38:34] i i know we all want to be in the
[38:36] rapture and and the word rapture is not
[38:39] even in the bible
[38:40] it is a word added to
[38:43] uh you know in this day to understand
[38:46] and the prophet said in paragraph 128 of
[38:49] the rapture message
[38:50] that the word rapture is not in the
[38:52] bible it's the word is caught up
[38:56] you know caught up to meet the lord in
[38:57] the air and things like that all right
[38:59] that's why i read what paul said in
[39:02] corinthians that he was caught up right
[39:06] all right
[39:07] now
[39:08] showing then my point is
[39:10] that i believe that the rapture was in
[39:13] paul that's what caught him up right you
[39:16] know the word rapture as we call it
[39:18] uh you know
[39:20] would would mean caught up
[39:22] now brother random used the word rapture
[39:25] uh 606 times in the message so i'm sure
[39:31] he knew a lot about the rapture
[39:33] you know
[39:34] because that was the point but now
[39:36] listen
[39:38] here's what i want to do now stop right
[39:40] there
[39:41] because i believe
[39:43] that the rapture is in you
[39:46] all right
[39:47] just like i preached and tried to show
[39:50] you that the second coming of the lord
[39:52] jesus christ started on the day of
[39:54] pentecost with the baptism of the holy
[39:57] ghost
[39:58] but there's plenty of things yet to be
[40:00] complete about his second coming
[40:03] that will transpire in this day or
[40:06] another day or whatever and you know
[40:09] just to say that the new birth is the
[40:11] second coming
[40:12] don't label me just so small because i'm
[40:16] not talking that way
[40:17] i'm talking about that when they started
[40:20] the when the new birth fell on the day
[40:22] of pentecost that that started the
[40:24] second coming of the lord jesus christ
[40:26] it will finish in the end time
[40:29] by the lord coming here
[40:31] to take us there so there's a lot to be
[40:34] said about it it's not just well or the
[40:37] second coming is a new birth i didn't
[40:39] teach it that away now so all right now
[40:41] and neither will it be to say that the
[40:44] day you got born again you was in the
[40:46] rapture
[40:48] no
[40:49] i believe the day you got born again the
[40:51] rapture was in you
[40:54] okay
[40:54] and i believe we'll try to prove that
[40:56] point to be able to to see because you
[41:00] know then we can i can understand
[41:03] all right
[41:04] but paul now he didn't go on
[41:08] because god didn't permit it
[41:12] he didn't go on to the perfection he was
[41:14] talking about
[41:16] he said let us go on to perfection
[41:19] you know he didn't attain unto
[41:22] the finish of it because he had
[41:25] he would walk off the earth in the
[41:26] rapture you know change
[41:28] and then you and i would have a lot of
[41:31] problems so you know i'm glad he didn't
[41:34] but uh i'll tell him when i see him and
[41:36] i thank him for that much
[41:38] but that was the way god had it for
[41:39] ordained anyway
[41:41] all right
[41:42] now even though paul
[41:44] you would admit that paul was standing
[41:47] at the
[41:48] faith of the fathers until even
[41:51] the uh
[41:52] peter would say that paul said things
[41:54] hard to be understood
[41:56] all right
[41:57] but yet paul never reached the change of
[41:59] the body
[42:01] he could be called up
[42:04] to see the third heaven and talk about
[42:06] it and come back and explain certain
[42:08] things
[42:10] he could be caught up and see many great
[42:12] things
[42:13] he was caught up in revelation
[42:16] and preached the word of god unto us
[42:19] but yet he never reached the position
[42:22] to where that the rapture could
[42:24] transpire
[42:25] all right now that's sensible
[42:28] that's not degrading that's sensible
[42:31] see it was not permitted because god had
[42:34] to wait until the end time
[42:37] until the entire opening of the word of
[42:39] god
[42:40] to be able
[42:43] to
[42:44] you know bring somebody
[42:47] to the position
[42:49] to make that change all right
[42:52] then
[42:53] see we know paul didn't preach the seals
[42:55] you know he didn't preach the son of man
[42:57] he didn't preach those things
[43:00] and not being doing it then it was
[43:03] waiting until the end time because all
[43:06] of the word was not given unto him
[43:09] but he had faith for the time
[43:12] and so did each born-again believer
[43:15] right now
[43:16] in doing that then
[43:19] i believe paul made manifest
[43:23] i don't believe he just talked about it
[43:26] he made manifest the things for his day
[43:30] now he spoke of things to come
[43:34] that he could not make manifest
[43:37] because he could not make the change in
[43:38] the thing but yet still he did for his
[43:41] time see those disciples we talk about
[43:44] it that they had the virtues they had
[43:46] the faith of the fathers but they did
[43:48] not have the headstone
[43:50] so that would mean in the end times
[43:51] something would have to come
[43:53] all right
[43:54] now
[43:56] i believe they were raptured up
[43:58] in the revelation or caught up
[44:01] in the revelation of the hour that they
[44:05] were living all right see that's what
[44:07] caught them up
[44:08] in ephesians two you'll find verse six
[44:12] he says we're resurrected
[44:14] sitting in heavenly places
[44:17] in christ jesus
[44:19] so the born-again believer by the new
[44:21] birth
[44:22] see
[44:23] would be part of the second coming of
[44:25] the lord jesus christ
[44:27] and will be a part in the rapture right
[44:31] by the new birth would secure your place
[44:33] now i can just you know you can run in
[44:36] your computer new birth and rapture or
[44:38] or whatever and and some things and and
[44:41] i'll be glad to show you where the
[44:43] prophet spoke of many things about
[44:45] the uh
[44:47] the fact that
[44:48] that new birth we'll read a few
[44:51] brings you everything you have in the of
[44:54] all right now
[44:56] but to line it up saying keep it right
[44:59] verse in in ephesians 1 and 3 it says
[45:02] blessing us with all spiritual
[45:05] blessings
[45:09] we're resurrected we're caught up right
[45:12] the born-again believer is caught up
[45:14] out of the world into a spiritual
[45:16] condition by the baptism of the holy
[45:18] ghost then you work
[45:20] and it's taking us even according to
[45:22] ephesians 1 and 20 is taking us up to
[45:26] the right hand of god
[45:29] now you say well
[45:31] well brother i know
[45:32] we're still right here
[45:35] so let's don't make this the right hand
[45:36] of god
[45:38] you know
[45:39] but by the baptism of the holy ghost
[45:42] your soul
[45:43] is all that is caught up
[45:46] the body and spirit is still in this
[45:49] carnality realm
[45:51] you know
[45:53] and that's where our trouble is at
[45:55] to where that we we need some help
[45:58] but see the new birth then
[46:00] in the soul
[46:02] would start the born-again believer
[46:06] putting us into a condition
[46:08] that the rapture would be in us
[46:12] not to just say we're in the rapture
[46:17] a lot of difference in the two
[46:19] statements
[46:22] the rapture is in the born-again
[46:24] believer
[46:25] because where is it coming from
[46:28] well and brother then we've got to wait
[46:29] till the end time where the lord and
[46:30] suffering said i said
[46:32] that there's a lot to be made manifest
[46:36] all right
[46:38] now
[46:40] so then what are we uh what have we done
[46:42] we have been caught up
[46:45] raptured up
[46:47] out of the sinful condition
[46:51] of the existence of the world
[46:53] into heavenly places
[46:57] which is the position of the believer
[47:00] in christ
[47:03] now
[47:04] that's why the prophet would say
[47:06] when they asked him a question
[47:08] then
[47:09] he said
[47:10] it'll just be a change
[47:13] it'll just be a change
[47:16] the simple thing of the translation the
[47:18] things can just be a change
[47:22] why because
[47:24] it's got to be in you and me
[47:29] if any if it's in you and me
[47:32] then it'll come out to the right place
[47:33] now
[47:36] listen to what your prophet had to say
[47:41] this is on christ the mr god revealed
[47:44] that he's been slowly unfolding the
[47:46] mystery now i didn't give you this so
[47:49] that was
[47:50] that this morning's not your seat
[47:54] give me some water i probably need it
[47:58] strung out this morning maybe we can
[48:00] hark it out this evening okay
[48:04] he said down through the ages
[48:07] he'd been slowly unfolding the mystery
[48:11] what christ is the mystery god revealed
[48:16] not jesus being the mystery
[48:18] christ
[48:20] all right now i believe that he was
[48:22] trying to show us too
[48:24] who we are and what had been taking
[48:26] place
[48:27] so this is what he says
[48:29] now to be sure that the whole rapture
[48:31] now
[48:33] luther was apart
[48:37] now
[48:38] he said well luther will be apart see
[48:44] see that's what your thinking is right
[48:47] luther will be apart
[48:50] you know
[48:51] what's your lifter's gonna come up
[48:54] well how's he gonna come up
[48:58] i see your mind i know what it is cause
[49:00] mine what students see
[49:01] your mind was locked to where luther
[49:04] will be in the rat shirt one day
[49:11] but that went away said it
[49:15] to be sure that the whole rapture now
[49:18] looked there was a part
[49:21] wesley was apart
[49:25] the prophets was apart
[49:28] thank you
[49:29] if there aren't a part
[49:31] you know watch what he's saying
[49:33] just in the revelation that they was
[49:36] making
[49:37] that they
[49:38] was making up the body
[49:42] the revelation making up the body
[49:44] feet toes arms and so forth until the
[49:47] head which we'll get to in a few minutes
[49:50] see
[49:51] that makes the entire
[49:54] rapture
[49:56] it's the body of the word which is
[49:57] crotch
[50:01] now
[50:03] as i said unlock your mind because
[50:05] your mind is thinking well sure we know
[50:08] we know
[50:10] one of these days
[50:14] luther's gonna be in the rapture
[50:17] but now that wasn't what he said
[50:21] he said look there was a part right
[50:24] okay
[50:25] all right
[50:26] so now let's get that correct
[50:30] in the rapture message
[50:33] paragraph 115
[50:35] 365 1204
[50:37] the life that comes up through luther
[50:40] was what made wesley
[50:42] the life that come out of wesley
[50:45] is what made pentecost
[50:46] the life that comes out of pentecost
[50:49] makes the wheat
[50:52] listen
[50:53] but they are a carrier
[50:59] and they remember masterpiece
[51:03] where the prophet brought in the message
[51:05] masterpiece
[51:06] luther wesley pentecost
[51:11] and said they were not the seed
[51:14] not meaning they were not part of the
[51:15] body of christ but what was he saying
[51:19] he said
[51:20] we've got to give birth to the seed
[51:24] we've got to be the seed in other words
[51:26] all right so now watch the life that
[51:29] come up to luther was what made wesley
[51:30] enough to come out of wesley is what
[51:32] made pentecost the life that comes out
[51:34] of pentecost makes a week but they are a
[51:36] carrier see the real life goes through
[51:39] there
[51:42] the message goes through
[51:44] but it's heading up into the wheat
[51:47] that's the reason that we come out and
[51:49] brings the whole thing in the rapture up
[51:52] here at the top
[51:56] the bride itself comes out of each age
[51:59] but the denominational stalk dies dries
[52:01] up
[52:02] and dies all right now
[52:06] luther and wesley and pentecost is going
[52:08] to be part of the rapture
[52:11] because the rapture was in them
[52:16] if you said they were in the rapture
[52:18] then you would put the rapture back
[52:19] there
[52:21] that's why i didn't agree with that and
[52:23] i don't even now agree with their
[52:24] statement that way i'd rather say the
[52:26] rapture is in you
[52:30] because when they receive that new birth
[52:37] then in that new birth
[52:40] is everything you have need of
[52:44] you remember that statement we'll read
[52:46] it in a minute
[52:48] everything we have need of is in that
[52:50] listen to what he says on abraham in his
[52:52] seed 1961 416.
[52:56] do you believe the church started at
[52:58] pentecost
[53:00] do you believe that first round are of
[53:01] jews and so forth then do you believe
[53:04] that the first reformation of the
[53:05] so-called church
[53:07] for the rapture
[53:09] was luther's group
[53:12] now was he degrading down there what is
[53:14] he saying
[53:16] was he degrading the first three church
[53:18] or some four church ages
[53:20] and then jumps up to the fifth or
[53:22] something like that
[53:23] no
[53:26] questions and answers in 1954
[53:29] 103 evening now i think luther west and
[53:32] all of them many of them will go in the
[53:34] rapture
[53:36] they had the portion of the spirit that
[53:38] was preached to them
[53:39] and they believed it
[53:43] now
[53:47] so the rapture
[53:50] is in you
[53:53] just like the second coming of jesus
[53:55] christ
[53:56] is in you
[53:58] by the new birth
[54:01] now the prophet said everything you have
[54:03] need of
[54:04] is in you when you receive that holy
[54:06] ghost now what did he say you needed to
[54:08] do
[54:11] he said you needed to do just like a
[54:13] tree
[54:15] said all the apples that ever be on the
[54:18] tree was in the tree then the seed when
[54:20] it's planted he said but what it needs
[54:22] to do is just keep drinking and drinking
[54:24] and pushing out
[54:27] i forgot how many gallons of water a day
[54:30] that just one small tree
[54:32] actually drinks it's up into 50 or
[54:34] something gallons a day
[54:36] that it actually consumes
[54:39] for that tree to be able to operate
[54:43] so let's just read what he said
[54:45] calling of abraham 1955 11
[54:48] 16 and i told you the other night you
[54:52] got to have faith
[54:53] but you got to know how to use that
[54:55] faith to make yourself well
[54:58] to get happiness out of life
[55:00] if you're born again everything you got
[55:03] in need of
[55:04] is right in you when you're born again
[55:09] because the holy spirit comes to heart
[55:12] and that's all you have need of
[55:14] it's the holy spirit it produces the
[55:17] rest
[55:19] now see then people would say well yeah
[55:21] i've got the new birth so i got
[55:22] everything
[55:24] all right now you're you're close to the
[55:26] truth
[55:30] but that's not all the truth
[55:32] because there's many feelings of the
[55:34] holy spirit
[55:35] there's a growth development in the holy
[55:37] spirit or the statue of a perfect man
[55:40] there are many things that goes with the
[55:42] new birth
[55:44] and that is part of the new birth
[55:49] but see that way then what i'm talking
[55:50] about the rapture is in us now
[55:56] that that will change us is in us
[55:59] it probably says your resurrection is in
[56:01] you
[56:02] i read one this morning i'm
[56:05] pretty sure it was in there
[56:06] he said your healing
[56:09] is in your new birth
[56:12] right
[56:14] so yeah but other people can be healed
[56:16] that's right because that's faith
[56:19] but we don't have to weigh up on those
[56:21] things
[56:23] we can believe because of the healer
[56:25] being inside of us
[56:28] all of that series on jehovah jireh
[56:30] georethanol
[56:32] was a background for this message this
[56:35] afternoon so now you let it pass over
[56:38] you and that's your problem
[56:41] just
[56:42] listen and let's see what it says
[56:47] i believe the day you were born again
[56:51] that you got the baptism of the holy
[56:52] ghost
[56:53] right now the prophet said
[56:56] now you explain this one to me
[56:59] the prophet said that
[57:02] the holy ghost was in you waiting on you
[57:03] to bring him the word
[57:05] you agree that statement
[57:09] well i thought the holy ghost was the
[57:10] word
[57:19] see that
[57:20] we're not thinking correctly
[57:23] i
[57:24] mean we're not thinking about the holy
[57:27] ghost can be in there in the new birth
[57:30] at faith and yet let's not have all of
[57:32] those virtues and that's why
[57:34] a big portion of the people of the
[57:35] message preached it you got to come all
[57:38] the way up to here
[57:40] before you get the new birth up to where
[57:43] it says holy spirit on the pyramid
[57:45] right under the basis of love
[57:47] but that's not correct because the
[57:49] prophet said you're born again at faith
[57:52] and then you add virtue see peter and
[57:53] him said all right
[57:54] now don't have time to go preach all of
[57:56] that but you ought to know it
[57:59] all right but see
[58:01] in that new birth
[58:04] you explain this one
[58:06] ever born born-again believer
[58:09] has the person
[58:11] of jesus christ
[58:14] living in you
[58:17] you agree with that statement amen is
[58:19] what your prophet said
[58:21] that's right
[58:22] how can every born-again believer say if
[58:24] there's only ten
[58:27] how can god be in every one of them
[58:31] because you're talking about god you're
[58:33] not talking about
[58:34] well he he just he's just a spirit you
[58:37] know he just
[58:38] no he's a person
[58:41] well how can that person be inside of
[58:43] you he's a little bitty person running
[58:45] around in that inch square compartment
[58:47] that everybody thinks would be the soul
[58:49] and a little fella running around in
[58:51] their head
[58:52] not quite
[58:54] see it's what we try to comprehend
[58:57] about things without
[58:59] really just
[59:00] relaxing and saying
[59:02] thank you lord i've got the person of
[59:05] jesus christ believing in me
[59:06] i don't understand it
[59:09] but i believe it amen
[59:12] all right
[59:13] but you see
[59:15] then the rapture
[59:18] is one
[59:19] what a probably called a rapture in the
[59:20] mexican wreck he said the rapture is
[59:22] revelation
[59:25] he said and the bride would be waiting
[59:28] for the revelation
[59:29] of the rapture
[59:33] but if you don't have the rapture inside
[59:35] of you
[59:39] how is it going to transpire
[59:40] right
[59:42] right
[59:43] i mean that's simple questions i just
[59:44] want to know
[59:47] if the rapture is not inside of you
[59:50] then
[59:51] we're gonna have to get it from
[59:53] somewhere
[59:54] you know
[59:55] right
[59:57] but if it's inside of you
[1:00:02] then it can keep pushing out
[1:00:05] until it brings out into manifestation
[1:00:08] what is inside of us
[1:00:11] that's all i want
[1:00:13] if we just keep adding that word and he
[1:00:15] keeps adding what we have to do
[1:00:17] because the rapture is a revelation now
[1:00:19] revelation is faith
[1:00:22] and faith is the substance of things
[1:00:24] hoped for
[1:00:26] the evidence of things not seen
[1:00:28] so it's a good position
[1:00:32] but if you're looking at the rapture out
[1:00:34] there
[1:00:36] i'm just honest now
[1:00:38] how do we get out there
[1:00:42] is the rapture up in the air 20 feet
[1:00:44] away is it over here is it over there is
[1:00:48] it in jeffersonville
[1:00:51] is it in tucson arizona
[1:00:54] because that's what everybody thought
[1:01:00] is that the way we think
[1:01:03] well one of these days
[1:01:05] one of these days something's gonna
[1:01:07] happen
[1:01:09] some brother's gonna pick it up
[1:01:13] and he don't preach it
[1:01:15] that's why you see these young guys come
[1:01:17] along
[1:01:18] and they
[1:01:19] you know man they know how to straighten
[1:01:20] everything out when they first come in
[1:01:22] you know
[1:01:23] you know a little pentecostal babies
[1:01:26] and they know how to preach and how to
[1:01:28] straighten everybody out
[1:01:30] and then they while they know all about
[1:01:32] the message
[1:01:34] and they knew all about the prophet what
[1:01:36] he said
[1:01:39] and they can give you quotes because
[1:01:40] they got the computer
[1:01:45] but do they know about the god of the
[1:01:47] word
[1:01:50] well brother dale aren't you looking for
[1:01:52] a time to come yeah because the word
[1:01:54] rapture means caught away
[1:01:57] caught up
[1:01:58] but we're not caught up in the baptism
[1:02:00] of the holy ghost
[1:02:02] by the new birth right there's no way to
[1:02:04] be caught up dark right
[1:02:06] because your prophet said
[1:02:08] only with the holy ghost
[1:02:10] would put you in the new birth put you
[1:02:13] in any phase
[1:02:14] to talk about a rapture
[1:02:17] he said for the rapture
[1:02:19] it's for the royal
[1:02:21] sea to abraham
[1:02:24] only right
[1:02:27] only for the royal seat of abraham
[1:02:29] it's not for everybody
[1:02:33] i'm sorry but it's not
[1:02:37] it's not for those
[1:02:39] who have not had a new birth
[1:02:42] but if luther had a part of the rapture
[1:02:46] wesley apart and the word they were
[1:02:49] making up of the age
[1:02:51] then would it not be that
[1:02:54] the new birth within them
[1:02:58] would be the rapture in them
[1:03:02] well i never thought of it like that
[1:03:04] okay
[1:03:06] see that way i'm trying to get our mind
[1:03:08] off of
[1:03:09] trying to look up to something
[1:03:11] and to get up here
[1:03:13] you know
[1:03:15] a place
[1:03:18] there is a place
[1:03:21] purity is in christ
[1:03:24] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:03:26] doctrine of christ
[1:03:28] let us go on
[1:03:32] the rapture within those people
[1:03:34] but let us go on amen
[1:03:38] the rapture is an ever born again
[1:03:39] believer
[1:03:41] but let us go on amen
[1:03:47] let us go on
[1:03:51] to that time of the rapture
[1:03:53] when i mean that i mean change
[1:03:58] let us go on to the time of being caught
[1:03:59] up the change cause even the dead has to
[1:04:02] come up we're all here together for a
[1:04:04] little while
[1:04:05] and then we're caught up to meet the
[1:04:07] lord in the air
[1:04:09] right
[1:04:10] so there's a lot about the rapture
[1:04:13] as i said about the second coming
[1:04:15] there's a lot about the rapture
[1:04:17] that will transpire
[1:04:19] and i do not believe
[1:04:21] that the second coming of jesus christ
[1:04:26] could have taken place without this
[1:04:27] prophet coming to branson message
[1:04:30] because i believe that is the second
[1:04:31] coming
[1:04:35] my new birth
[1:04:37] then
[1:04:38] would match up and agree with everything
[1:04:41] that would ever be said down to time of
[1:04:43] the truth now not the wrong things
[1:04:47] i truly believe in luther's message of
[1:04:51] the just shall live by faith
[1:04:54] i truly believe in sanctification
[1:04:57] i believe in the baptism of the holy
[1:04:59] ghost the gifts the things i believe in
[1:05:02] all of it why because my new birth
[1:05:06] will compare with all of that
[1:05:10] and that's the only way i know it's
[1:05:11] right
[1:05:13] it's in my new birth
[1:05:15] how do i how many times have i told you
[1:05:17] this how do i check
[1:05:19] doctrines
[1:05:24] get these out
[1:05:26] get them out just like that and don't
[1:05:27] turn them over now i know you will
[1:05:35] just leave it like that
[1:05:39] you don't have to fold it
[1:05:44] because
[1:05:45] see i wanted you to make up your mind
[1:05:49] as to about what i've been saying
[1:05:52] and then we're going to read what
[1:05:53] brother ryan said
[1:05:57] see and if you made up your mind brother
[1:05:59] dale don't know what in the world he's
[1:06:00] talking about
[1:06:03] all the rapture's out younger and one
[1:06:05] day we'll run fast enough and we'll jump
[1:06:08] up there and we'll we'll we'll make it
[1:06:11] or somebody's gonna come along
[1:06:14] they can't preach this though
[1:06:16] you know some of these brothers
[1:06:19] that's what i said you see somebody
[1:06:21] young come along they start off
[1:06:25] and all at once you see people just
[1:06:26] flock into it
[1:06:28] just go into it
[1:06:31] and just following it
[1:06:34] and then after a while you see them
[1:06:35] backing away
[1:06:37] because they come to realize
[1:06:40] that you look something wrong
[1:06:43] you know
[1:06:45] but they uh
[1:06:48] you know they go far after for a while
[1:06:52] and there's never been a doctrine that
[1:06:54] has come out that i've known of
[1:06:56] that i didn't try to thoroughly study
[1:06:59] those things
[1:07:03] because i believe
[1:07:05] that
[1:07:06] you know
[1:07:07] like brother said all doctrines are
[1:07:09] based upon truth
[1:07:12] now i want to know what the person said
[1:07:15] i've defended people
[1:07:17] when people would say i've defended
[1:07:19] publicly and don't mind saying it i
[1:07:21] don't agree with the two lords
[1:07:25] i don't
[1:07:26] but i defended the brother that preached
[1:07:28] it this way
[1:07:29] i said you don't understand what he's
[1:07:32] trying to say
[1:07:34] he's too intelligent
[1:07:38] to be saying that there's two like two
[1:07:41] like used to be twos you know
[1:07:44] he's trying to say something
[1:07:47] but
[1:07:48] then i heard him myself
[1:07:51] say that jesus was a
[1:07:53] another person
[1:07:54] yeah okay
[1:07:56] i heard it
[1:07:58] you know
[1:07:59] you said i never said that well the type
[1:08:01] did i don't know how i got a hold of
[1:08:03] them but
[1:08:04] i didn't hear it
[1:08:07] but you see
[1:08:10] that didn't agree with my holy spirit
[1:08:17] now
[1:08:18] that's why i believe see
[1:08:20] that everybody down through there
[1:08:24] i believe the rapture has been a process
[1:08:27] that started on the death pentecost
[1:08:30] and it began to
[1:08:32] unfold itself
[1:08:35] down through time
[1:08:38] and bringing it out to the place
[1:08:40] until here in the end time
[1:08:42] someone is going to see
[1:08:46] the change
[1:08:47] and i'm praying hoping you and i are
[1:08:49] part of it
[1:08:50] if not we're going to change don't worry
[1:08:51] about it we just go by the grave
[1:08:54] sister clevis used to always kidding
[1:08:56] with us about it and she'd say if i go
[1:08:58] to the grave before you said i'll get to
[1:09:01] beat you up
[1:09:03] and that's true because that's what the
[1:09:04] bible says the lord himself shall you
[1:09:07] know i mean the dead cross your eyes
[1:09:08] first
[1:09:09] all right now
[1:09:11] what you see i believe the rapture is in
[1:09:13] us
[1:09:14] when you receive that new birth
[1:09:17] but what you need to do
[1:09:19] is you keep me to putting word into that
[1:09:21] soul
[1:09:23] faith comes by what
[1:09:26] hear it
[1:09:28] so the holy ghost is waiting on you and
[1:09:30] i
[1:09:32] to bring him the word
[1:09:35] and your prophet said he'll quicken it
[1:09:38] just as quick as you bring it
[1:09:42] now i'm honest how about you
[1:09:46] i've read a lot of things
[1:09:48] but you know what
[1:09:50] i'm glad god didn't reveal as the truth
[1:09:58] and you
[1:10:00] because we're reading with our old
[1:10:01] former glasses you know
[1:10:04] we're reading it like bad just matthew
[1:10:05] this presbyterian
[1:10:07] brand of monster
[1:10:08] whatever
[1:10:11] but you know god can't quicken error
[1:10:15] how can he do it
[1:10:17] he can't make error live
[1:10:21] but he can make his work live
[1:10:25] show everything you have need of
[1:10:31] lies within that new birth
[1:10:34] but if we don't keep drinking in
[1:10:37] and pushing out
[1:10:39] drinking in and pushing out are going on
[1:10:44] it will become
[1:10:45] dead words
[1:10:48] you say does that mean that we're lost
[1:10:50] and going to help no
[1:10:52] you wouldn't listen to this morning
[1:10:54] it doesn't mean that you're lost
[1:10:56] true christians down through time
[1:11:00] have looked at things and it become dead
[1:11:02] works
[1:11:03] and because they did not go home
[1:11:07] it really did become dead works
[1:11:10] they tied together the two messages
[1:11:12] now let's read this
[1:11:15] it's from the message show it's the
[1:11:16] father 1953 907 a service
[1:11:23] what you have to do with the tree
[1:11:25] you take the tree and you plant it in
[1:11:26] the ground
[1:11:27] then you have to water it and as you
[1:11:29] water it it doesn't do nothing but drink
[1:11:31] drink drink
[1:11:33] it has to drink more than its portion
[1:11:35] and more it drinks
[1:11:38] the bigger it swells up
[1:11:41] it pushes out limbs then it pushes out
[1:11:43] leaves then it pushes out blossoms then
[1:11:45] it pushes that output to that right and
[1:11:48] that's where christian
[1:11:49] is
[1:11:51] we are planted together in christ jesus
[1:11:53] who is the inexhaustible fountain of
[1:11:55] life
[1:11:56] we're planted in christ and we just
[1:11:58] drink and drink and drink and push out
[1:12:00] and everything we have need of for the
[1:12:03] earthly journey
[1:12:04] this divine healing
[1:12:06] the power of god and all these other
[1:12:09] things
[1:12:10] is in every individual in here that's
[1:12:12] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:15] for you're planted in christ hallelujah
[1:12:18] the holy ghost baptism yes sir and
[1:12:21] everything you have need of for this
[1:12:22] life's journey
[1:12:24] even the rapture
[1:12:26] is right in you then
[1:12:29] okay
[1:12:32] don't resent that
[1:12:35] now you won't tell you to know i'm
[1:12:37] reading what brother brown said
[1:12:40] he said the rapture's in you and he said
[1:12:41] these things he said don't resent that
[1:12:46] that's the truth
[1:12:48] the rapture is in us now
[1:12:53] i will prove it by the gospel
[1:12:56] now look where he goes
[1:12:58] those who he called he justified and
[1:13:01] those who he justified he hath glorified
[1:13:03] hallelujah
[1:13:05] then in heaven today we're a glorified
[1:13:07] in the presence
[1:13:09] of god right now
[1:13:11] i'm just pushing out to it see glory
[1:13:15] god's in his word you believe it all
[1:13:17] right
[1:13:21] just push it out
[1:13:25] the rapture is in you now
[1:13:31] so in 1953
[1:13:36] was not
[1:13:37] 1965
[1:13:39] when the prophet preached it
[1:13:42] so a lot of people's idea of the rapture
[1:13:45] is that the rapture
[1:13:48] was just nothing until brother branham
[1:13:50] came
[1:13:54] we could read the bible
[1:13:57] right
[1:13:58] and we talked about a rapture right
[1:14:02] no of course we didn't know what it was
[1:14:03] no but
[1:14:06] we knew something about it
[1:14:10] and the rapture is only for the royal
[1:14:13] seat of abraham it's only father born
[1:14:15] again believer
[1:14:16] the rest will have to come up
[1:14:18] at another time and be judged
[1:14:21] and things to receive life
[1:14:26] but the rapture comes first
[1:14:28] i'm looking down on the other notes
[1:14:31] see not how i were to show it 1965
[1:14:33] that's why the rapture is different and
[1:14:35] only and will only be for the royal seed
[1:14:38] of abraham it cannot come by natural
[1:14:40] carnal seed of the church it'll have to
[1:14:42] be the royal seed of abraham the royal
[1:14:45] seeds of the word of god
[1:14:47] true abraham
[1:14:49] the royal seed
[1:14:51] that's why the rapture has to be first
[1:14:54] and he gives you
[1:14:56] the trumpet divorce and has to be first
[1:14:59] because the rapture is in you now
[1:15:03] his second coming is in you now
[1:15:09] so it's not to say that we're in the
[1:15:11] rapture it's to say the rapture is in us
[1:15:17] all right
[1:15:18] now the minute you receive the new birth
[1:15:23] that automatically means one thing
[1:15:28] you're going in the rapture right
[1:15:33] no matter how small
[1:15:36] or whatever point
[1:15:40] no matter who it was down to the ages
[1:15:42] luther wesley whatever we use those
[1:15:44] because a lot of people differ about
[1:15:46] lutheran wesley you know as being
[1:15:49] people say oh they didn't have nothing
[1:15:53] they had the new birth of the age
[1:15:56] and that new birth of the age put them
[1:15:58] in the kingdom of god
[1:16:01] and made them a place that they would
[1:16:03] come up in a resurrection
[1:16:05] and walk off the earth just like you and
[1:16:07] i will
[1:16:09] the only difference between the two is
[1:16:12] god never permitted
[1:16:15] them to do that
[1:16:17] but one day here he's going to permit
[1:16:19] someone to
[1:16:20] see what the rapture really is amen
[1:16:25] and it's inside of you
[1:16:28] right
[1:16:30] it's not a place or a you know a
[1:16:32] jeffersonville or a tucson or
[1:16:35] you know
[1:16:36] they kept on with brother branham and
[1:16:38] what did he finally say
[1:16:40] they want to know about a place what'd
[1:16:42] he say
[1:16:43] he said i just got it
[1:16:45] there is a place that you must be all
[1:16:47] right
[1:16:50] boy everybody had their pen
[1:16:52] make sure i spell this right honey
[1:16:55] you know
[1:16:58] let's get the right address
[1:17:01] i i know what they've done
[1:17:04] years ago some of them wrote the
[1:17:05] questions and others wrote the answer
[1:17:07] because they didn't have no books back
[1:17:08] then right and some of them from athens
[1:17:10] that's what they've done
[1:17:11] through a brother called i mean brother
[1:17:13] sister colleen gin and some of those
[1:17:15] people one of them would write the
[1:17:16] question doesn't write the answer
[1:17:17] because they couldn't get all of it
[1:17:20] so you know okay now honey
[1:17:22] you write to the place and i'll write
[1:17:23] the address you know
[1:17:25] so we know exactly the street number
[1:17:28] no he said
[1:17:29] he's in jesus christ
[1:17:34] and he's the word amen amen
[1:17:39] it's in jesus christ
[1:17:41] the place is in jesus christ
[1:17:48] this is not us in christ
[1:17:51] it's christ in us
[1:17:58] we didn't come here with eternal life
[1:18:02] but we came here in jesus christ
[1:18:06] now jesus christ comes in us
[1:18:08] to give us eternal life
[1:18:11] ever born again believer
[1:18:16] who was it
[1:18:18] anyhow
[1:18:20] somebody told it
[1:18:21] that they wanted brother brown to go
[1:18:22] talk to their like their daddy or
[1:18:24] granddaddy or something and they wanted
[1:18:26] them to see where the old man was at
[1:18:29] you know you may have heard the story
[1:18:34] so brother random goes in sits down and
[1:18:36] talks with the old brother
[1:18:38] never says a word gets up and walks out
[1:18:40] you know not nothing to him about
[1:18:42] anything
[1:18:44] and come out
[1:18:45] put around him
[1:18:47] he said
[1:18:48] don't worry about him
[1:18:51] he'll be there
[1:18:54] said he's in another age
[1:19:01] see they wanted to get up into where
[1:19:03] they were at
[1:19:06] they said he's in another age he says
[1:19:08] he'll be there
[1:19:11] see brother i'll never try to explain
[1:19:13] the seals or thunders 70 wicks of daniel
[1:19:16] whatever to the man
[1:19:20] but by the gift that god had given him
[1:19:23] he knew the man was a born-again
[1:19:24] believer
[1:19:26] but he was of another age
[1:19:30] and there was no need of trying to help
[1:19:31] him
[1:19:32] because he doesn't like me that got too
[1:19:34] old i guess
[1:19:36] but you see what i'm talking about
[1:19:41] the rapture is in you
[1:19:43] now
[1:19:47] just keep pushing
[1:19:48] out just keep drinking in
[1:19:52] just keep on inhaling the message
[1:19:56] until we become the message
[1:20:02] i'm having so much trouble
[1:20:05] well
[1:20:10] all i got to say for you is one thing
[1:20:12] it's going to get worse
[1:20:16] okay grumbling gripe yourself on the way
[1:20:19] do what you don't do
[1:20:22] he said well
[1:20:23] you you you sure ain't that preacher
[1:20:25] but you can tell us about the good
[1:20:27] things
[1:20:35] i liked that brother
[1:20:38] walker
[1:20:39] and what he had to say
[1:20:42] he kind of made a graft on the picture
[1:20:45] you know
[1:20:50] and he said now right here is what you
[1:20:51] think you can stand
[1:20:54] you know
[1:20:57] i said this line right above here is
[1:21:00] where you're going
[1:21:04] see immediately come to me the bible
[1:21:06] says that god will not allow
[1:21:08] anything to be placed on you that you
[1:21:10] cannot
[1:21:11] right
[1:21:13] he'll give you grace for it
[1:21:15] so he made it a graph and he said this
[1:21:17] is what you think you can stand that's
[1:21:18] your height of level of pain that's as
[1:21:20] far as you can go but here's where it's
[1:21:22] going
[1:21:25] well he's done a great job and he made a
[1:21:27] little drawing and made a pretty good
[1:21:28] size a little drawing of a pyramid
[1:21:31] and see it goes up to that red line and
[1:21:33] back down
[1:21:36] you know
[1:21:37] he said now you ready you get up tired
[1:21:39] everything's great okay you stood it
[1:21:42] he said now here's what god does
[1:21:44] you just push that line on up higher
[1:21:51] and he give you your fighting level
[1:21:52] right above the red you know
[1:21:55] said now here's where you're going
[1:22:00] i don't understand it but he said even
[1:22:01] the medical doctors agreed
[1:22:05] because i wouldn't hurry i don't
[1:22:06] understand
[1:22:07] he said he was in so much pain
[1:22:11] until
[1:22:13] he said literally
[1:22:15] the morphine the highest level they
[1:22:17] could give him
[1:22:19] was nothing like enough to be able to
[1:22:22] even just take off the sharpness
[1:22:27] and because he was just beat up plant
[1:22:29] busted in his mouth
[1:22:31] he just all tore up
[1:22:33] and worried about him with brain damage
[1:22:34] that was the worst thing
[1:22:37] and they figured he'd never make it for
[1:22:38] nothing
[1:22:39] anyhow
[1:22:41] he said there was this thing came up out
[1:22:43] of him
[1:22:45] and stood beside of him
[1:22:48] and said it was a saying
[1:22:52] more is coming more is coming more is
[1:22:55] coming
[1:22:58] i forgot the words i'll use it the best
[1:23:00] that i remember but he called it and the
[1:23:01] medical doctors or the people called it
[1:23:04] the the
[1:23:05] pain booger
[1:23:07] you know
[1:23:09] was there beside of him for a long time
[1:23:15] he said one day
[1:23:17] it was
[1:23:18] nobody in the room but him
[1:23:21] said here come alive
[1:23:24] and said a person walked up the side of
[1:23:26] you
[1:23:27] arms folded
[1:23:30] this went over it
[1:23:33] look down at him
[1:23:35] and i forgot what the wordings sister
[1:23:37] truly brought remember more
[1:23:39] nanny that one
[1:23:41] but then when that man finished with his
[1:23:43] statement the pain left
[1:23:47] he was totally gone
[1:23:50] then his point was you think you can't
[1:23:51] stand it
[1:23:56] he said and as a unless you're a
[1:23:58] christian you can't
[1:24:02] see a christian can stand a whole lot
[1:24:04] more pain than a person that's not a
[1:24:05] christian
[1:24:09] because you realize the end of it
[1:24:13] i was listening and thinking about what
[1:24:14] the bible says about that you know that
[1:24:17] that word like a woman having a baby
[1:24:20] it's horrible
[1:24:22] death is very close to any woman's ever
[1:24:25] had a baby in the natural part anyway
[1:24:29] but yet
[1:24:30] you see them just in a little while and
[1:24:32] they're grinning holding the baby
[1:24:35] and the bible says that you
[1:24:37] is soon forgotten because a man child is
[1:24:39] born
[1:24:41] now
[1:24:42] if you were standing
[1:24:44] looking at the pain sisters
[1:24:47] and looking at the baby
[1:24:50] you know some way
[1:24:54] would you say it's not worth it
[1:24:59] huh
[1:25:00] joyce told danny get out of here and
[1:25:02] shut up
[1:25:05] cause he was telling her to push the
[1:25:06] push
[1:25:08] she said get out of here
[1:25:12] but look at how open jacob
[1:25:16] the point is the end of anything
[1:25:20] if you saw the end of it
[1:25:27] it does away with all of the middle oh
[1:25:28] that's where christians are to do
[1:25:31] we'll look at the end of all things
[1:25:33] we may be facing horrible situations of
[1:25:36] life
[1:25:37] losing basically all because brother
[1:25:39] brown said it become physically bereft
[1:25:42] to lose all
[1:25:46] that's what he said
[1:25:50] but the ultimate end of seeing jesus
[1:25:52] christ
[1:25:57] either the pain or agony's not even
[1:25:59] thought of
[1:26:02] you know i never really could understand
[1:26:04] one thing and
[1:26:05] i saw that uh rabbi richman
[1:26:10] on the videos of brother biscuit it
[1:26:12] really helped me to understand something
[1:26:16] because you know death is horrible
[1:26:19] painful
[1:26:21] agonizing
[1:26:23] but you know god looked down and
[1:26:26] he saw adam and eve and he saw them lost
[1:26:30] and he killed the animals
[1:26:33] and ripped the skin off of them right
[1:26:40] every sacrifice that was put forth don't
[1:26:43] you think god didn't know all of the
[1:26:45] millions of animals that's been been
[1:26:47] offered upon altars and things don't you
[1:26:49] think god knows the pain of each and
[1:26:51] every one of those
[1:26:55] and that brother made a statement it
[1:26:56] really helped me he said
[1:27:01] that god sees the end
[1:27:04] of what that would be
[1:27:06] and said thereby the animal would
[1:27:08] graciously lay down and give his life
[1:27:13] because he knows what the ultimate end
[1:27:15] is to cover all of that
[1:27:17] and how we would be lost without it
[1:27:20] plenty of stories of people giving their
[1:27:22] lives
[1:27:23] to try to save other people
[1:27:27] you know
[1:27:30] let's take another day about those
[1:27:33] 30-something miners that was
[1:27:35] 2 000 something feet underground
[1:27:38] they drilled a hole down
[1:27:41] and i knew they said they were going to
[1:27:42] have to pull them up through there and i
[1:27:43] wondered well how in the world are they
[1:27:46] going to get them up to there
[1:27:47] because pull it up and i mean i've been
[1:27:50] in whales and
[1:27:51] and the ropes don't work too good and
[1:27:53] you bite the sides and every rock is
[1:27:55] there are you going to scratch it and
[1:27:57] you know
[1:27:59] i've been down 90 feet on the ground
[1:28:01] working in wells
[1:28:05] that rope's going to be biting big big
[1:28:07] baby
[1:28:08] and naturally they could not do it
[1:28:10] exactly perfectly straight
[1:28:13] because there's no way
[1:28:15] could be done
[1:28:18] i saw the picture of it
[1:28:21] they had a little capsule
[1:28:25] and they put that capsule down through
[1:28:26] the ground right you know what that is
[1:28:30] and oxygen
[1:28:33] but how are you going to get that guy
[1:28:34] from the oxygen up to the oxygen you
[1:28:37] know
[1:28:38] well it's going to breathe in now i
[1:28:39] couldn't bring the shaft into it
[1:28:42] and oxygen and everything that the man
[1:28:44] in need the only thing he needed to do
[1:28:48] i forgot did anybody remember the exact
[1:28:50] inches
[1:28:51] was it 23
[1:28:53] or 20
[1:28:54] there had to be within a certain range
[1:28:59] a width
[1:29:00] to be able to get in that capsule
[1:29:04] so i would imagine if it been me
[1:29:07] i would have went on a diet
[1:29:12] to make sure i could fit in that little
[1:29:14] capsule
[1:29:15] but you know they got a mirror worn out
[1:29:20] but you know what they've done before
[1:29:21] they brought them out
[1:29:28] they would have
[1:29:30] excuse me
[1:29:32] they put a man in that same bag
[1:29:38] man got in the capsule in the city now
[1:29:43] you know
[1:29:47] that's what happened
[1:29:49] for you and me
[1:29:51] someone had to come in a capsule
[1:29:55] to be able to take our place
[1:29:58] all we got to do is make sure that we
[1:30:00] don't get overloaded with abandoned
[1:30:02] baggage of the world and too fat i used
[1:30:06] to kid brother mold i said it's going to
[1:30:07] take more rapture and faith for you than
[1:30:10] his me
[1:30:11] but back then he was about this tall and
[1:30:14] weighed more than i did
[1:30:16] you know
[1:30:17] you know i used to tell him i said you
[1:30:18] better lose some weight it's going to
[1:30:19] take more fights for you
[1:30:22] but you see
[1:30:26] every one of those people come out of
[1:30:27] there
[1:30:29] every member of the body of christ has
[1:30:30] been sealed in a capsule
[1:30:34] she has been preserved with oxygen and
[1:30:36] everything that we have needles amen
[1:30:39] they may be two or three thousand feet
[1:30:41] that we have to follow
[1:30:43] to get out
[1:30:46] but god made a way
[1:30:48] god made away from you and i that's
[1:30:50] right
[1:30:51] think about it
[1:30:52] the rapture is in you now amen
[1:30:57] by the new birth
[1:31:00] and that was a 53 statement
[1:31:05] that your prophet knew
[1:31:08] so when he was preaching in 65
[1:31:10] was it something different
[1:31:14] no he was just telling us how
[1:31:18] right
[1:31:21] telling us how it could take place
[1:31:24] you know to get those men out of that
[1:31:25] ground somebody had to figure that thing
[1:31:27] out
[1:31:30] and they had to drill our holes down
[1:31:33] right you know first
[1:31:35] then they had to go
[1:31:38] and you know what me and you do i
[1:31:40] remember reading a story about a tunnel
[1:31:41] one time they was digging like this on
[1:31:43] each side to come together
[1:31:45] well they missed it
[1:31:49] within that tunnel
[1:31:51] back out you know because they missed it
[1:31:55] there's our dead works folks of thinking
[1:31:57] that we've got it right
[1:31:58] and we know what's going on
[1:32:01] let's just let god do it
[1:32:04] the rapture is in you now by the new
[1:32:06] birth
[1:32:07] all we got to do is just keep drinking
[1:32:09] in until the capsule is finished
[1:32:13] to carry us out of here
[1:32:17] because the rapture is a revelation of
[1:32:18] god's word
[1:32:20] right
[1:32:21] one step at a time amen
[1:32:24] come on really enjoyed the children come
[1:32:27] on jesus
[1:32:28] really enjoyed the children singing
[1:32:31] they're part of the service
[1:32:36] the rapture is in you now
[1:32:40] just keep drinking
[1:32:42] and pushing out
[1:32:46] until we make manifest what that profit
[1:32:48] has
[1:32:49] brought to us
[1:32:52] you know folks i told you this morning
[1:32:56] we're not backing up
[1:33:02] we're not backing up
[1:33:05] we're gonna approach some things to see
[1:33:08] what is perfection
[1:33:12] because we got to go under perfection
[1:33:16] if we don't have it we got to go on to
[1:33:18] it
[1:33:20] god's already making way because the
[1:33:21] message is here we're not looking for
[1:33:23] somewhere else or something to do
[1:33:25] it's in the message
[1:33:30] what we got to do is just keep digging
[1:33:31] it out
[1:33:33] until we get the tunnel correct and god
[1:33:35] supply the capsule he just brings us
[1:33:37] right out of it all
[1:33:41] impossibilities in years past
[1:33:43] for those men to have been brought out
[1:33:45] of there even a few years down the road
[1:33:49] an impossibility
[1:33:52] but they brought them all out
[1:33:56] impossible for a rapture to
[1:33:59] fully be made manifest and come to a
[1:34:01] conclusion until this end time and god
[1:34:03] had to send us a prophet to give us the
[1:34:05] word
[1:34:07] all we got to do is get pressurized is
[1:34:09] that the words he used
[1:34:12] he said we need to get pressurized
[1:34:14] because when you go up into space you
[1:34:16] know you got to have a whole lot you you
[1:34:18] that been up in the air as much as as
[1:34:20] you know
[1:34:22] what is it over ten thousand feet twelve
[1:34:24] or something then they gotta pressurize
[1:34:25] the cabin
[1:34:29] and without that then you go up and you
[1:34:30] pass out and die
[1:34:32] see it wasn't possible down through
[1:34:34] there because god didn't permit it
[1:34:37] but in the end time he sent a prophet to
[1:34:39] bring us the message and he is
[1:34:40] permitting it now
[1:34:43] all that we have need of is laying
[1:34:44] within the message so let's get into the
[1:34:46] message
[1:34:47] why is the people are scared of the
[1:34:49] message well we don't want to get into
[1:34:51] them deep things well i brought around
[1:34:53] preaching
[1:34:56] now he didn't have a bit of trouble
[1:34:57] coming out on a message called feast of
[1:34:59] the trumpets pretty sure
[1:35:02] and he said now i don't have to preach
[1:35:04] that he said because it was
[1:35:05] supernaturally revealed
[1:35:07] in the opening of the seals
[1:35:09] and he says that don't apply to the gen
[1:35:12] to the bride
[1:35:13] so
[1:35:14] i don't have to preach it
[1:35:16] now he would've had a bit of trouble
[1:35:18] come out there the day of the seals and
[1:35:19] said now
[1:35:20] we don't have to worry about this
[1:35:22] we just
[1:35:24] you know
[1:35:26] this is all over
[1:35:28] no
[1:35:30] that's what's going to pressurize you
[1:35:32] and me
[1:35:33] is the revealed word
[1:35:35] of the message of the hour
[1:35:38] i don't know of any other way to go to
[1:35:40] you
[1:35:40] if you do let's get changed in a hurry
[1:35:42] because
[1:35:43] we're running out you know
[1:35:46] let's stand
[1:35:48] 5 30 faith for the time we may have had
[1:35:50] it down through there but now is the
[1:35:53] time to put that faith into action
[1:35:57] get fit for the capsules
[1:35:59] to be ready to go
[1:36:21] clean
[1:36:30] here
[1:36:42] from
[1:37:04] salvation are you talking about a
[1:37:06] rapture
[1:37:31] me
[1:37:37] me
[1:37:59] related to the buildings and the
[1:38:01] properties and all
[1:38:04] let's just believe all of these worked
[1:38:06] out
[1:38:09] right
[1:38:10] let's believe that
[1:38:11] everything needs to be worked out
[1:38:27] you're the problem solver
[1:38:29] we just get in the way
[1:38:31] so you just come on the scene now and
[1:38:33] work out all the problems that
[1:38:35] are done and

[1:38:38] situation the buildings and the
[1:38:40] properties and everything

[1:39:46] savior jesus christ
[1:39:48] we send this prayer cloth
[1:39:50] we grant our lord
[1:39:52] that you work out all the things in his
[1:39:54] life he just gets so weak and run down
[1:39:56] and can't work and
[1:39:58] things

[1:40:01] we know who the healer is
[1:40:03] and we believe you and we commit it to
[1:40:05] you now in the name of jesus christ

[1:42:09] we love you
[1:42:14] anybody else
[1:42:17] do you have nothing because you asked
[1:42:19] god

[1:42:24] asked
[1:42:26] and see
[1:42:37] with
[1:42:54] holy spirit
[1:43:01] unto me
[1:43:15] brother boyd you know
[1:43:17] that's what he wants to be read here
[1:43:19] jonathan is now deployed
[1:43:21] in afghanistan and he has a an address
[1:43:24] there and he's smart downstairs
[1:43:28] and showing you where to send it
[1:43:30] and carts and letters and things
[1:43:32] and you know just let him know that
[1:43:34] you're thinking of him that you're
[1:43:35] praying for him
[1:43:36] you know all the things and praying
[1:43:38] everything will be all right
[1:43:40] uh
[1:43:41] if you wanted to send snacks or other
[1:43:43] things
[1:43:44] there are certain limitations in other
[1:43:46] words if you want to send him a gift of
[1:43:47] some kind there is a certain limitation
[1:43:49] you have to talk to sister ashley you
[1:43:51] know about those things and
[1:43:53] doing it but uh
[1:43:55] just
[1:43:57] think about him and pray for him
[1:43:59] and everything has to be exactly written
[1:44:02] correctly
[1:44:03] because they want you know how they are
[1:44:05] and also in the military so you know
[1:44:08] just remember that right
[1:44:10] and just pray that the lord would take
[1:44:12] care of it

[1:44:20] lord jesus we love you father
[1:44:23] we pray that you would
[1:44:26] open our understanding
[1:44:30] and to reveal to us lord that whatever
[1:44:32] we have need of is inside of us
[1:44:35] we don't have to pray it down
[1:44:40] lord said joshua was prayed through
[1:44:42] before the world
[1:44:44] joshua didn't even have the new birth
[1:44:46] inside of him to pray for him
[1:44:49] but we have the very god of the world
[1:44:51] the earth to all things
[1:44:53] all of those compound names of jehovah
[1:44:58] is dwelling inside of us by the new
[1:45:00] birth so all we have need of is to
[1:45:04] contact you in there
[1:45:08] i'm sure there's a human element out
[1:45:09] here that we have troubles but
[1:45:12] father you're the only one that can
[1:45:13] override it i don't understand how you
[1:45:16] could ever come down and save a human
[1:45:18] mortal when we're so rotten and wretched
[1:45:21] mess
[1:45:22] but you did
[1:45:25] and you made a way
[1:45:27] you make a way for this rapture change
[1:45:31] you'll make a way for the caught up
[1:45:34] god is already inside of us
[1:45:36] we love you father
[1:45:38] and we committed to you now
[1:45:40] in jesus name
[1:45:43] you dismiss never pray one for another
[1:46:14] i am
[1:46:28] oh
[1:46:43] oh
[1:47:11] wow
[1:47:23] thank you
[1:47:37] oh
[1:48:00] you
