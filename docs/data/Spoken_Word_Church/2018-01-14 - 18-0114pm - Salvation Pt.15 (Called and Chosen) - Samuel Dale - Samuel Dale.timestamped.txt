[19:49] thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I
[19:51] will pay that that I have vowed
[19:54] salvation is of the Lord and the Lord
[19:57] spake unto the feast and in vomited out
[19:59] Jonah upon the dry land now let's go to
[20:02] Peter 2nd Peter 1 and we're going to
[20:08] jump over from a normal run of using
[20:11] this scripture and pick up just a
[20:16] thought because it will fit in to help
[20:19] us later but it bring into talk to of
[20:22] what we need okay first Peter 1 verse 10
[20:27] wherefore the rather brethren give
[20:31] diligence to make your calling and
[20:33] election sure free if you do these
[20:36] things you shall never fall
[20:39] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[20:42] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[20:46] kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[20:49] Christ wherefore I will not be negligent
[20:53] to put you always in remembers of these
[20:57] things though you know them and be
[20:59] established in the present truth amen so
[21:03] you may be seated the Lord at his
[21:05] blessing to the reading of the word know
[21:10] I hear a fan running but it must be
[21:16] running heat rich we can get it changed
[21:22] to click it a little bit anyway make it
[21:26] work oh now there's going to be hard to
[21:30] get to this position of using this
[21:34] scripture but it will fall into the line
[21:37] but it's dealing with making sure you
[21:42] know and in an entrance it's made into
[21:44] the kingdom for you etc okay now we
[21:50] studied this morning about the fact of
[21:54] ending of the Old Testament bringing in
[21:58] to the New Testament and that being the
[22:01] Old Testament the plan of salvation was
[22:04] back there and that we don't have to
[22:08] change any plans from the old to the new
[22:12] because it's the same salvation but just
[22:16] further advanced if everybody following
[22:20] me along in that line that it's an
[22:22] advancement it's not an addition it's
[22:24] not something that is it was back there
[22:28] he was spoke of back there he was
[22:31] brought out through the Old Testament so
[22:33] much until a lot of times they would you
[22:37] know stop the waters they would kill the
[22:40] lines the buyer the different things
[22:42] through faith to be in that position you
[22:48] know in showing salvation was there
[22:52] and that it had a position to her that
[22:56] when you passed away that you would have
[22:58] a place to go to are those people you
[23:02] know the Old Testament so then dealing
[23:04] with salvation in the Old Testament
[23:06] what are we to look for in the new not a
[23:09] different thing just further advancement
[23:13] you know advancing them more into what
[23:16] we're talking about because there's only
[23:18] one salvation there's only one faith one
[23:21] Lord one baptism there's not a lot of
[23:25] different salvation that's what we were
[23:27] talking about this morning that the
[23:29] prophet of God said that there was 900
[23:32] different churches and he said if you
[23:35] ask those churches what it means for you
[23:38] to be born again he said each one of
[23:41] them would have a different way of
[23:44] expressing the new birth to them are
[23:47] being born again uh-huh so then you know
[23:51] we know that it can't be all of that but
[23:55] we know also and we don't discredit we
[23:58] know that people how truth and they've
[24:01] had truth down through time and things
[24:04] like that
[24:04] and they still have truth they're still
[24:08] in a way you could say that the churches
[24:11] are still serving God and brother
[24:14] Branham now has no trouble calling them
[24:18] Christians now you study the message
[24:24] from that line he has no trouble calling
[24:27] the Baptist Christians which I hold no
[24:31] they're not Christian he had no trouble
[24:34] calling the Baptist Methodist
[24:36] Presbyterian Pentecostals whatever and
[24:38] would say Christians he has no trouble
[24:42] with calling them brother
[24:44] he said I'll even call the Pope brother
[24:48] hmm go see that would be part of the
[24:51] Word of God cause he is my brother right
[24:54] and we were all this brothers
[24:56] oh no we're not brothers I'm I'm writing
[24:59] you back well that's you got a lot of
[25:02] sense in haven't you
[25:03] we're all come from one blood coming
[25:08] down god made of one flesh all mankind
[25:11] you know and brought it down all right
[25:13] now but that was what we were talking
[25:15] about this morning just labeling it
[25:18] toward these two messages
[25:20] these are wedge to put in to carry us
[25:22] from the Old Testament salvation that
[25:25] we've been dealing with deliverance you
[25:28] know the things that happen to come into
[25:30] a New Testament form of salvation all
[25:35] right and then I'll keep saying it over
[25:37] and over then you can't have one
[25:39] salvation back here being under one way
[25:42] or something and then this over here
[25:45] being under another way it can't be it's
[25:49] further advancement we believe now come
[25:55] on we believe that there was a day that
[25:57] the Lutheran's had the truth and were
[26:02] the people of that day you agree well
[26:06] you don't want that salvation you know
[26:08] what they're in the Bride of Christ you
[26:11] know whether you want to believe it or
[26:12] not they're part of the body of Christ
[26:15] then you move up to the badness to the
[26:19] different churches coming down and at
[26:23] the time they were the people of that
[26:26] hour the bride of that hour and they had
[26:31] the salvation for that hour but what was
[26:34] it from the Lutheran to the Methodist
[26:37] serginho movement it's just a further
[26:39] advancement the Prophet said unless the
[26:42] hello that he said the Holy Ghost and
[26:44] justified the lutheran sanctified the
[26:47] methodist baptize the Pentecostals is
[26:50] now sitting in order to coming of the
[26:52] lord further advancement of the same
[26:57] salvation all right now don't lose that
[27:00] because when I get into the Lord willing
[27:03] next week and start coming down to very
[27:05] very basic simple elementary doubts see
[27:11] then you're gonna try to run over here
[27:12] you're gonna try to run over there
[27:14] and if don't don't do it just stay with
[27:17] me and when it's all finished in you
[27:19] cloud on the really well okay that's
[27:23] like I told him one time with having
[27:24] this ministers meeting I said at least
[27:26] you could tell me you don't agree with
[27:28] me what I said you won't you go out tell
[27:30] everybody else you don't agree I said
[27:32] you're right here now I'm gonna tell you
[27:34] I don't agree with y'all
[27:36] well there was one brother out of the
[27:38] crowd raised his hand he said I want you
[27:40] to know what I don't agree we I so I
[27:41] appreciate that and never offended me
[27:45] none whatsoever you know all right but
[27:48] now listen the to be born again is to be
[27:52] born from above to come from where Jesus
[27:57] came now we're gonna read a scripture
[27:59] right here to show the scripture
[28:02] verifies that clearly to our
[28:05] understanding and if we would just read
[28:08] all the scriptures that away I just
[28:10] picked this one I was gonna use it as a
[28:12] scriptural you know to read to start
[28:15] with but I thought no there's so much in
[28:18] that one scripture that verifies our
[28:20] talks about the things that I want to
[28:22] talk about this afternoon
[28:24] all right because what we're going to do
[28:26] now we know that there was a salvation
[28:30] in the Old Testament okay now we've got
[28:33] that but we know that salvation in the
[28:36] Old Testament was looking forward to the
[28:40] new right see Jesus Christ died for the
[28:43] sins of everybody where it be Old
[28:46] Testament New Testament all right are we
[28:48] in the Word of God that's the truth now
[28:49] so he died for the sins of everybody
[28:51] died once for all
[28:53] all right now and then what he done he
[28:56] brought it over into a situation so it
[28:59] was necessary
[29:01] as we were trying to express this
[29:03] morning now that he was our kinsman not
[29:06] just kinsman redeemer to just be a
[29:10] redeemer to redeem ourselves but to be
[29:12] our kinsman all the way until he would
[29:16] be glad to call us according to the
[29:18] scripture cause his brother all right
[29:21] he literally became human the prophet
[29:23] said to take away the human sin all
[29:28] right and see he was saying when he said
[29:31] to Nicodemus you must be born again
[29:34] Nicodemus couldn't understand that he
[29:39] says you mean I gotta go back to my
[29:40] mother's womb to be born again and see
[29:43] he couldn't understand that we're gonna
[29:44] read a scripture here in a minute and
[29:46] you'll see that a lot of times the
[29:48] people could follow Jesus up to a degree
[29:50] see Nicodemus could go with him to a
[29:53] certain point but then it would just
[29:55] stop because it required more than to
[30:00] just simply believe it all right now so
[30:05] you must be born again means you must be
[30:07] born from above the only way we can get
[30:12] any new birth that would be worth
[30:14] anything is to come from above Jesus
[30:18] constantly spoke of us saying this
[30:20] morning is my kingdom was of this world
[30:23] my disciples would fight my followers he
[30:27] said but it's not of this world he said
[30:29] I'm not of this world
[30:30] and then what did he turn around later
[30:32] saying to the disciples he said you're
[30:35] not in this world right he telling those
[30:39] disciples what was coming in to them was
[30:43] going to set them aside just like he was
[30:46] to not be part of this situation but to
[30:49] have to live here exist here and do all
[30:53] the things but yet not be part of this
[30:55] world all right now in doing that then
[30:58] it would bring us to the position as we
[31:03] covered with the Book of Ruth that she
[31:08] talked to her that was talking about she
[31:10] had to have a kinsman
[31:14] right the devil was the one kinfolks to
[31:17] us and it was our in the parable with
[31:20] the one that he had built boys had to
[31:22] deal with all right and as he dealt with
[31:25] that then he purchased Naomi and got
[31:29] Ruth all right
[31:31] now in doing that then it brought in the
[31:34] Gentile dispensation because Ruth being
[31:38] a Gentile he brought in the dispensation
[31:41] of the Gentiles now watch what I'm
[31:43] saying and you'll see this will go with
[31:46] this if we keep following it then the
[31:49] salvation back tyre was not just for the
[31:51] Jews only it was for those that believed
[32:00] that's a simple it life it was for those
[32:04] that believed ever that's too simple cuz
[32:07] we gotta get it yeah
[32:08] yes say in the morning you gotta get
[32:11] your linen sheets ain't you
[32:12] you gotta get your lineage in there to
[32:15] get something tied up well I'll just
[32:17] have a decency
[32:18] I wish you'd go back and study the Book
[32:21] of Ruth as I was trying to bring out
[32:23] this morning Ruth and Boaz gets married
[32:29] produces a child the child doesn't go to
[32:33] the lineage of Boaz it goes to the
[32:40] lineage of may Helen of how you
[32:43] pronounced Roose first husband to carry
[32:49] his lineage on and from there comes yes
[32:53] in in the you can't do anything with
[33:00] those lineages you're gonna run aground
[33:02] every time you try because somebody's
[33:05] gonna be smart enough to read the word
[33:06] and say now what you gonna do the
[33:10] lineage don't go to that the lineage
[33:12] don't go to marry the Linney's goes to
[33:14] Joseph in coming down to Jesus and
[33:17] certainly we know Joseph is not the
[33:19] father of Jesus
[33:25] now listen then getting to that at point
[33:30] that he had to come now how many times
[33:34] and we need it over the Prophet that God
[33:39] came himself he didn't send a son he
[33:44] didn't send a prophet he didn't send
[33:46] somebody else God came himself no so God
[33:53] was in Christ reconciling the world unto
[33:56] himself so there when that little baby
[33:59] was born it was born a human baby you
[34:04] know sixteen elements you'd call it but
[34:07] it was created why but it was born a
[34:11] human being our brother all right but
[34:16] his soul and his spirit was Almighty God
[34:20] according to some of these great
[34:22] Revelator's now in the message they say
[34:25] that Jesus wouldn't God till the River
[34:26] Jordan well I just forget it I can't get
[34:33] away from what scripture said scripture
[34:35] said he was born Lord to Christ so
[34:37] that's enough to settle the problem you
[34:39] know but it ain't going to because
[34:41] people are going to continue on with
[34:42] their thoughts as they believe it
[34:45] alright but now listen then to take the
[34:49] scriptures and see that Almighty God
[34:52] came to earth and he came to earth to
[34:58] not only pay the price and then slower
[35:04] listen he didn't come to just pay the
[35:08] price that was all that was a big thing
[35:12] right he came to make a way that his
[35:19] kingdom could come in to mankind is that
[35:24] simple enough he came to pay the price
[35:29] to clear the debt
[35:32] but he came to Mecca way did he come to
[35:35] live in mankind wanna see then it would
[35:39] be necessary not only that God Himself
[35:44] come not another person but God himself
[35:49] would have to come to the earth and then
[35:54] as he came to the earth see that one
[35:56] that we called Jesus would be Almighty
[35:59] God in human flesh there's life in the
[36:04] other day / Richardson you know my phone
[36:08] has got 2 or 3 things in it and there's
[36:11] one picture like this you know the
[36:13] hoffmans kind of in on that style and
[36:16] and little Lily she was sitting there
[36:19] and she was looking at it and I said
[36:22] Lily who is that
[36:24] she said that's Jesus okay you think it
[36:32] don't dwell in their hearts and minds
[36:33] and different things now come on now sit
[36:36] down a little bit she flipped through
[36:38] another part of it and it had the
[36:39] picture that's outside in the hallway of
[36:42] Christ standing in the seven golden
[36:45] candlesticks and the things around you
[36:47] know like that it doesn't look that much
[36:50] like Hoffman's right and I said Lily
[36:54] who's that she says that's God no she's
[37:00] thinking more and I'm thinking huh she
[37:03] said that's God well in a little bit we
[37:05] asked her again she said that's God in
[37:07] Jesus she was getting it together you
[37:10] know
[37:10] then he's these little kids might know a
[37:13] lot more than we think maybe we never
[37:16] let them talk let's listen all right it
[37:21] means then one from above to bring
[37:26] Redemption to earth the one on the earth
[37:30] would have to take that plan and bring
[37:33] it into reality and make it manifest die
[37:39] give his life so that he could come back
[37:44] in you and I
[37:46] not as we used to think about the
[37:47] Trinitarians you know and our our God in
[37:49] three persons thoughts that God come to
[37:52] make away you know we'd say that yeah
[37:53] God come to make away for Jesus to come
[37:56] and bring the Holy Ghost and get it in
[37:57] we don't understand it but we believe it
[38:01] believe what but you see that very
[38:08] spirit that was in that man that walked
[38:10] the shores of Galilee is in you and the
[38:13] new birth or you don't have any birth
[38:15] and that spirit that's in you and the
[38:18] new with an uber has got to be the soul
[38:20] of Almighty God so we're not trying to
[38:23] divide soul and spirit when it comes to
[38:25] Zara now when we get down to in the
[38:27] message those things are going to be
[38:30] very valuable they're not to try to
[38:32] divide because anytime you divide you
[38:34] conquer right that's that's what
[38:38] divisions are for I never didn't learn
[38:40] too much about it in school but I didn't
[38:42] know you could divide a little bit all
[38:44] right now so I want to read I want
[38:47] telling to pull up and let's read this
[38:50] before we get started and then we can
[38:52] get into the message we pull up number
[38:55] one from John 6 and I want you to just
[39:02] follow with me and watch the life of
[39:06] Christ his purpose how he was God coming
[39:12] to earth coming to give his life call
[39:18] you and I and bring us to salvation huh
[39:23] see just reading the Word of God now
[39:26] watch what he said I love this scripture
[39:28] of always like this one
[39:29] you know verse 28 he said then said they
[39:34] unto Him what shall we do that we may
[39:40] work the works of God
[39:47] what can we do that we can work the
[39:49] works of God
[39:53] you know evidently in their mind in his
[39:57] message that he was bringing to him and
[39:59] talking to him he had stirred enough
[40:02] part in them too for them to think about
[40:07] doing the works of God you know and see
[40:12] we said well the works of God is to heal
[40:14] the sick cast out Devils and all of
[40:15] that's part of it but that won't bring
[40:21] you to the full meaning alright so watch
[40:24] what he says jesus answered and said
[40:27] unto them this is the work of God that
[40:34] you believe on Him whom he has sent
[40:40] now we know he didn't send somebody he
[40:44] came himself right so we're not changing
[40:48] the scripture to say to believe on him
[40:50] who came forth he why we're not dealing
[40:56] with trinitarianism know we ought to be
[40:58] above that day now look they said unto
[41:02] the him what signs show us now then that
[41:07] we may see and believe thee what does
[41:11] that work they didn't get a thing in or
[41:16] elysia right he's talking about the
[41:23] works of God which would include
[41:28] healings and signs and wonders and
[41:29] things right but it would have a meaning
[41:33] somewhere that would pick up enough
[41:35] until they wouldn't be getting what he's
[41:39] talking about I'm trying to illustrate
[41:41] you get down here in a minute you'll see
[41:43] this group of people just like Nicodemus
[41:45] they never did understand what Jesus
[41:47] said
[41:54] they said what can we do that we might
[41:57] work the works of God he said just
[41:58] believe me we know what he's saying I'm
[42:02] in a plain language wouldn't it just
[42:03] he's just saying you just believe me cuz
[42:07] I'm doing the works of God
[42:08] cuz I am God then they say it what sign
[42:20] sure some kind of a sign that we may see
[42:24] and believe thee man's always wanted
[42:29] some kind of an evidence or a proof they
[42:35] never got what he was talking about he
[42:38] was simply saying you believe that I am
[42:41] he that's the works of God not great
[42:49] signs and wonders that goes with it
[42:50] because that's part of the deal but the
[42:53] main part of the deal is whether we
[42:54] believe in God or not okay we're gonna
[42:58] hit the old testament heavy with that to
[43:00] bounce over huh not worse what does that
[43:03] work what what do you do that we can
[43:08] believe you're doing the works of God I
[43:09] believe you come from God I believe that
[43:12] you are God they surely had trouble with
[43:14] that one now look what say it our
[43:17] fathers did eat manna in the desert and
[43:21] it is written he gave them bread from
[43:23] heaven to eat they're saying then jesus
[43:28] said unto them verily verily I say unto
[43:31] you Moses gave you not that bread from
[43:35] heaven but my father giveth you the true
[43:40] bread from heaven see
[43:47] they wanted a sign he goes to the word
[43:52] are you looking read the Bible why don't
[43:57] you sit down sometimes just read it like
[43:59] that and look at it and just didn't say
[44:00] what in the world is this talking about
[44:05] they're wanting signs he's saying to
[44:09] believe is what you need to do they
[44:13] saying what are you saying then what
[44:15] kind of sign can you do that we believe
[44:17] you then they begin to get real you know
[44:25] they said in him Burleigh where I said
[44:27] Moses gave you not that brilliancy they
[44:30] said Moses gave us a bring Moses never
[44:33] gave him no bread
[44:35] then what but my father giveth you the
[44:40] true bread from heaven little words
[44:43] where I come from
[44:48] naturally the bread fell out of the sky
[44:50] okay for the bread of God is he which
[44:54] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[44:58] unto the world now he's telling him who
[45:02] he is and what his purpose is and the
[45:05] Old Testament to be fulfilled in him
[45:10] because the manna back there was just
[45:12] etat right look they said unto Him Lord
[45:17] evermore give us this bread no one who
[45:22] were least on that they think he's
[45:24] talking about naturally right I mean
[45:28] evidently cuz they go to natural food
[45:32] jesus said unto him them I am the bread
[45:36] of life he that cometh to me shall never
[45:40] hunger and he that believeth on me shall
[45:43] never thirst but I said unto you that
[45:51] you also have seen me
[45:56] and belief not with Nicodemus cause he
[46:04] couldn't understand a new birth could
[46:07] they understand anything there that he
[46:08] was talking about to them continue on
[46:11] listen all that the father hath given me
[46:14] shall come to me now isn't he explaining
[46:21] the 40 come far to come to get the
[46:23] children of God bring salvation right or
[46:28] were you with me all that the father has
[46:33] given me she'll come to me in him that
[46:36] coming to me I will in no wise cast out
[46:38] look where I came down from heaven not
[46:47] to do my own will but the will of him
[46:51] that sent me now what he come far that's
[46:57] what he's just saying I come down to do
[47:02] the will of my father the one that's in
[47:09] you because one that's in him was when
[47:11] it was any then watch him and this is
[47:14] the father's wheel which is sent me that
[47:20] all which he had given me I should lose
[47:29] nothing but raise it up again at the
[47:32] last day now he's beginning to preach a
[47:35] little predestination yeah we won't go
[47:38] into very much but that's pretty well
[47:40] what it's doing right and what and this
[47:47] is the will of him that sent me that
[47:50] everyone would see it the son
[47:54] now watch him that ain't enough to just
[47:57] see the son watching and believeth on
[48:01] him may have everlasting life
[48:06] and I'll raise him up at the last day
[48:11] to everyone that see if the Sun and
[48:18] believe on him okay what does it come up
[48:23] to be everlasting life do you understand
[48:28] what I was trying to get at that's the
[48:29] next one it's coming up so they can hold
[48:32] it up first time do you understand what
[48:34] I'm getting at we were talking this
[48:39] morning that he came down from heaven
[48:40] now he's telling you why he came from
[48:43] heaven to do the will of the one that
[48:46] sent him in other words I've come to die
[48:50] the only way you'll ever understand what
[48:53] I'm talking about is for me to die and
[48:58] just like he said to Nicodemus Nicodemus
[49:00] you can't understand what I'm saying
[49:02] unless you get born again yeah we oh we
[49:07] know all of what he said we understand
[49:17] do we understand mentally or spiritually
[49:24] you know you can understand mentally and
[49:27] know all mysteries not how the truth of
[49:33] it but we claim to believe
[49:46] but do we believe oh I believe I like
[49:55] the one that said Lord now help down my
[49:58] unbelief now think about it he told our
[50:06] in the scripture what he came to do
[50:11] it's just said it in different words and
[50:14] different things but it's right there in
[50:16] the message he came to pay the price the
[50:20] scripture we read he came to do the will
[50:22] of the Father pay the price give his
[50:25] life Frank Christ bring the life into us
[50:28] if we'd only believe it now look what he
[50:35] gets to go ahead with the next one John
[50:36] 6:44 no man can come to me except the
[50:44] Father which has sent me now had the
[50:49] father send him he come down when in him
[50:52] draw him and I'll raise him up at the
[50:56] last day so there's no New Testament
[51:04] salvation except that first be a calling
[51:10] or a drawing it's not that for everybody
[51:17] right oh yeah we know it's not for
[51:20] everybody that we received it with
[51:21] everybody ain't gonna receive it so it's
[51:23] not our for everybody if we realize
[51:29] whether we're called or not we realized
[51:33] whether he's drawing us or not then
[51:39] we'll strike it when we get to over in
[51:41] the message that got him laid one or two
[51:42] in there now but right here that word
[51:45] talks about you know that were chosen
[51:47] and the Prophet said now you didn't
[51:49] choose him sit according to the Bible he
[51:53] chose you
[51:55] so we've got a pretty little bit of
[51:57] predestination sitting in our way but we
[52:00] won't try to express it because we
[52:02] preach predestination enough to you over
[52:04] the years if you don't understand that
[52:06] you're gonna miss it anyway but just
[52:09] think about it no man can come to me
[52:17] except the Father which has sent me draw
[52:23] him let's get the next one why we had it
[52:28] John 14 early year she excuse me jesus
[52:34] saith unto him I am the way the truth
[52:37] and the life and no man can cometh unto
[52:40] the father but by me are you with me now
[52:48] he's saying no man can come except to
[52:51] father drawing now he's saying that no
[52:54] man cometh unto the father but by me
[53:00] right
[53:02] do you get it you flip-flopped pretty
[53:07] right see salvation dinner the New
[53:13] Testament is not based upon what we
[53:16] think oh we just join a church we shout
[53:19] with ready to deal with it it's based
[53:23] upon whether we're called or not
[53:33] whatever now that that gets into pre
[53:35] determining you we've got a few more
[53:40] scriptures in here that there's many
[53:42] called the fewer chosen
[53:46] you remember Judas the guy you remember
[53:51] Judas was chosen
[53:52] you remember Judas had part of the
[53:54] ministry remember Judas had two healings
[53:57] and the signs and the wonders remember
[53:59] Judas was chosen of God now we're in the
[54:05] Bible do you find any were any other
[54:08] disciples you know even in a basis of a
[54:12] great meeting happening you know just an
[54:15] area where what'd you call it the gold
[54:16] fancy words I like them you know that
[54:18] everybody's don't know what they mean
[54:19] but you know that there's a great big
[54:23] meeting going on and and the disciples
[54:26] go walking through the meeting and then
[54:30] they see him and do it and they follow
[54:31] him nothing in the Bible
[54:35] and anything in the Bible in the Bible
[54:39] they're out fishing they're out making
[54:43] the living he goes by and called them
[54:47] right he goes by and calls them Peter
[54:52] yeah sure didn't do a good and get
[54:55] Matthew in you know who Matthew was tax
[55:00] collector was short of a bad time of the
[55:03] year to bringing that up tax collector
[55:07] and what about now that he would even
[55:12] choose Judas knowing what he would do
[55:18] now you need the Bible cuz it said he
[55:20] knew from the beginning like you Judas
[55:23] was you need the scriptures to be put
[55:25] with it you're supposed to be reading
[55:26] your Bible right if you reading your
[55:30] Bible then we shouldn't have any trouble
[55:31] with words all right we see down what
[55:36] happens we can't come unless the father
[55:41] draws us
[55:44] the father and the son has to be the
[55:47] same person because you can't come as
[55:49] the son don't call you know so that's
[55:56] the same person calling you does that
[55:58] solve that problem too scriptures it
[56:01] looks like it's saying one that's
[56:03] waiting one that way and they're both
[56:04] simple if he just realized Jesus was
[56:08] Almighty God who was it called those
[56:11] disciples Almighty God said come follow
[56:15] me
[56:16] that was Almighty God walking the shores
[56:19] of Galilee see no man can come to the
[56:22] Father except by the son no man can come
[56:27] to the son except by the father we don't
[56:35] want that that means that means the
[56:39] father and the son the same person right
[56:43] if not then you got back to your
[56:45] Trinitarian concept okay that's what I
[56:49] said brother I said it'd be easier if
[56:51] everybody understood the one that's at
[56:52] the Godhead
[56:53] it'd be easy to preach but see we look
[56:57] at things and thinking about it and we
[57:02] try to figure out whether we're caller
[57:03] or not we're gonna get down in a minute
[57:08] how you know whether you call it or not
[57:09] but just follow me through the
[57:11] scriptures and just think about it what
[57:17] happened to you somewhere down the line
[57:18] in your life somewhere in some part of
[57:26] your life you had a contact with God
[57:39] if you didn't you might need to try to
[57:42] find a contact that's the best way of
[57:44] putting it but that's all right you know
[57:46] but can you remember where God started
[57:50] dealing with you you never was searching
[57:55] for God oh I cried and I prayed you and
[58:00] I love the Bible where it's got the
[58:02] answer the Bible says the goodness of
[58:06] God is what leadeth thee to repentance
[58:08] so that solves that problem if there's
[58:11] anything whatsoever in a line of what
[58:13] you think was for this or that or the
[58:15] other that caused me to come to the Lord
[58:16] just remember that Scripture that was
[58:20] the goodness of God that leadeth me to
[58:23] repentance they wasn't what we could do
[58:26] yes what brother dare you don't
[58:28] understand I cried and pray I spent two
[58:30] years in this message after coming in
[58:34] this message I prayed and I cried I
[58:38] fasted I've done everything to try to
[58:41] find what I needed
[58:49] until one day I come to find out by the
[58:53] roundabout way that brother Moute said
[58:55] it to me he said I know you're not
[58:57] looking for any evidences because I know
[58:59] you you you know we'd been together a
[59:01] long time - you're a lot of study
[59:04] together he said I know you're not
[59:06] trying to find any signs and wonders he
[59:09] said but I don't know what's wrong I
[59:10] said I don't either if I did I get rid
[59:12] of it
[59:14] he said well you just quit trying to
[59:17] find something and said you accept God
[59:23] that sounds like a bad fish
[59:31] we'll see that wouldn't Allah say it
[59:34] he said you start searching God in the
[59:39] world to approach him from the word and
[59:49] for two years of tozi I spent day and
[59:57] night studying the message and a
[1:00:00] wonderful job at work darling brother
[1:00:02] colleague in very five set up there with
[1:00:05] him for hours and hours day in and day
[1:00:07] out reading or talking was about the
[1:00:11] Word of God one day I read six books and
[1:00:19] I listened to two tapes in one day one
[1:00:23] to work one back home your thought about
[1:00:27] the doing that like I had because that's
[1:00:34] what he said to me he said you're
[1:00:35] searching for some kind of something
[1:00:37] what said quit trying to do that instant
[1:00:39] except what the word says I said thank
[1:00:45] you lord
[1:00:46] I'm not okay that's all it took well I
[1:00:50] fell one when I fell the other o
[1:00:52] hollyhocks down in Athens Georgia rut
[1:00:56] Road an old drunk was right to iron peg
[1:00:57] he fell over one way no drunk was
[1:01:00] sitting there looking at her and she
[1:01:01] fell over in the glade he's come up and
[1:01:03] covered her up with her with us
[1:01:04] something you know a blanket or
[1:01:06] something and that old drunk need isn't
[1:01:09] looking how I remember it now I get he
[1:01:12] thought what in the world's going on
[1:01:13] around here
[1:01:14] you know but you know what I kind of
[1:01:18] believe he finally got through to me no
[1:01:21] there are no problems in because see
[1:01:23] when I get to work this over here is
[1:01:25] that tells me that I know see there know
[1:01:28] how no problems but let's get to point
[1:01:30] out of the way of one thing we can't
[1:01:33] start the New Testament any different
[1:01:37] from the form of using in the Old
[1:01:38] Testament
[1:01:40] and is it true see now in the Old
[1:01:42] Testament it was God searching for man
[1:01:47] no come on show me anywhere any Bible
[1:01:51] anything of the Old Testament or anybody
[1:01:53] or the New Testament about people
[1:01:55] seeking for God it was God seeking man
[1:02:04] God come down and spoke to Abram I said
[1:02:06] get up and go there was always God
[1:02:14] searching for man what did the Prophet
[1:02:15] say that it wasn't Adam in the garden
[1:02:18] running around hollering gone God where
[1:02:20] are you he said it would God running
[1:02:21] around saying Adam were you so the Old
[1:02:26] Testament form of salvation is based
[1:02:28] upon the fact of us believing that God
[1:02:32] is doing the calling the New Testament
[1:02:35] will have to come with the same form he
[1:02:38] went to the disciples he said Peter come
[1:02:40] James come John come Matthew he
[1:02:43] hand-picked those ones to be his
[1:02:49] disciples and even chose Judas so he
[1:02:54] must have had a light for what he was
[1:02:56] not just the fact that he knew he was
[1:02:58] going to be the portrayer he must have
[1:03:01] been a pretty good guy because nobody in
[1:03:02] the group knew about it but Jesus right
[1:03:06] nobody knew that Judas and what he was
[1:03:09] but Jesus so he must have been are you
[1:03:13] calling the man of the year alright so
[1:03:17] then if we can realize from the Old
[1:03:22] Testament or New Testament that it's
[1:03:24] dealing upon God calling us it's not
[1:03:32] dealing upon us calling him but yet we
[1:03:38] pray like I said
[1:03:44] we're not told to fast and pray to try
[1:03:47] to bring God to us
[1:03:49] we're told to fast and pray to get us
[1:03:51] out of the way I thought that was
[1:03:56] fasting was not to get God to come but
[1:04:00] was to get us out of the way all right
[1:04:04] now so then all of them back in the Old
[1:04:08] Testament even coming into work that
[1:04:11] Jesus walking upon the earth would show
[1:04:13] the example that he would want for the
[1:04:16] New Testament because the New Testament
[1:04:17] never begun through the book of Acts
[1:04:19] which is when the Holy Ghost came he set
[1:04:22] forth in his ministry in his life
[1:04:25] showing that he was handpicking
[1:04:28] I remember on the daniel 70 weeks years
[1:04:31] ago said before that struck me as a
[1:04:33] really a great thought of the fact that
[1:04:37] you know what we talk about Jews coming
[1:04:39] as a nation he never started that out on
[1:04:43] he never started out like the Jews he
[1:04:48] never started out he went to the Jews
[1:04:49] and they rejected him what did he do he
[1:04:52] started handpicking he started a Gentile
[1:04:58] dispensation right there before he ever
[1:05:01] come into being sure he was still
[1:05:03] dealing with Israel you know what I love
[1:05:05] about brother Branham he would tell us
[1:05:08] things that would be marvelous things
[1:05:09] sometimes hard to understand Iran said
[1:05:12] and God never quit dealing with Israel
[1:05:16] even in Calvary you won't just go he
[1:05:21] said he dealt with him for 40 years
[1:05:26] that's a great statement that's a great
[1:05:29] guy he was still dealing with Israel 40
[1:05:38] years
[1:05:40] what a god we serve but think about it
[1:05:44] now no man cometh unto the father but by
[1:05:48] me and no man can come to me except the
[1:05:54] Father which has sent me draws him so
[1:06:02] we're in the right order the Old
[1:06:04] Testament is based upon God handpicking
[1:06:07] people maybe that's the wrong
[1:06:10] terminology you give me something else
[1:06:12] to call because he chose people right he
[1:06:19] chose Israel but then he tells you to
[1:06:21] each other he chose Israel and not
[1:06:24] Israel's natural lineage because it goes
[1:06:28] from what it Abraham to Isaac don't go
[1:06:35] to issue they don't go to all the other
[1:06:37] sons of Abraham it goes to Isaac because
[1:06:41] he's handpicking
[1:06:43] his people working on predestination why
[1:06:47] did he choose Abraham I love nothing
[1:06:51] else for one statement wrote around made
[1:06:53] to show you predestination how it works
[1:06:56] he said God knew Abraham would teach his
[1:06:59] children the we think predestination and
[1:07:06] just based upon the flip flop thing to
[1:07:08] throw out and God grabs or whatever you
[1:07:11] better remember that your profit keeps
[1:07:14] expressing the Bible where it said Jacob
[1:07:17] have I loved and Esau have I hated
[1:07:19] why did he love Jacob because Jacob went
[1:07:24] for the birthright and he knew that Esau
[1:07:27] hated the birthright
[1:07:28] and that cut him off so predestination
[1:07:32] we might order consider it it might have
[1:07:37] a little bit to do with the manner of
[1:07:39] life we live
[1:07:45] but you better remember one thing now
[1:07:48] you can't get good enough to be saved so
[1:07:51] it ain't that away then he got none do
[1:07:54] being good enough to be saved it's got
[1:07:56] something to do with your yielding to
[1:07:59] God or believe in God or serving him are
[1:08:03] wanting to serve him baby might find a
[1:08:07] little predestination they in there but
[1:08:10] look what he goes on to call it now look
[1:08:13] at vert look at number 4 which is 2nd
[1:08:16] Peter 1:10 therefore they're rather a
[1:08:19] brethren div be of diligence to make
[1:08:22] your calling and election sure calling
[1:08:31] an election there's a calling that many
[1:08:36] are called but few are chosen which is
[1:08:39] few are elected Judas was caught by
[1:08:45] little great prophet great time but who
[1:08:51] was chosen
[1:08:58] many are called but few are chosen
[1:09:03] so make your calling and make your
[1:09:05] election sure well how can I do that
[1:09:08] brother brother Dale
[1:09:10] it's just pray to God didn't think about
[1:09:14] him and listen study the word thank own
[1:09:25] God it goes on down into Matthew 22 and
[1:09:35] 14 says many are called and few are
[1:09:39] chosen
[1:09:40] many are called and fewer children the
[1:09:44] choosing the prophet said I'm looking at
[1:09:46] it today
[1:09:47] he said to choosing when I think I've
[1:09:49] got it in here he said was based upon
[1:09:51] before the foundation of the world
[1:09:58] calling was by his foreknowledge from
[1:10:03] the foundation of the world he knew he
[1:10:05] would call Judas right he knew he would
[1:10:10] call him but he predestinated according
[1:10:14] to Judas and what he finished up with he
[1:10:24] called Jacob the predestinated he saw
[1:10:28] according to what Esau wanted maybe
[1:10:33] order consider it trying to bring
[1:10:37] salvation to a point of getting us to
[1:10:40] think about it think about the children
[1:10:47] of Israel as they were gathered during
[1:10:50] going down to the promised land they
[1:10:56] reached the promised land and only two
[1:11:01] were true or real believers Summerlin
[1:11:05] church age church age book page 148
[1:11:09] that is correct because the word tells
[1:11:12] us that the rest died because of
[1:11:15] unbelief and because of unbelief they
[1:11:19] could not enter into here in Hebrews
[1:11:23] 3:19 then since that is so and only to
[1:11:29] entered then the rest were not true
[1:11:34] believers
[1:11:37] now think about true believers that were
[1:11:44] Israelites they believed they were the
[1:11:49] people of God they had two circumcision
[1:11:52] they had all the signs that all the
[1:11:54] great times they believed that they were
[1:11:55] the people of God
[1:11:58] well what about only two mazes you know
[1:12:02] to go in the promised land we know the
[1:12:04] story that is what is one thing two
[1:12:11] stayed with the word when the hearts of
[1:12:15] the ten spies failed in Katie's Barnea
[1:12:18] Joshua and Caleb did not stagger for
[1:12:20] they believed the word and said we're
[1:12:24] more than able to take the land they
[1:12:27] knew they could because God had said I
[1:12:31] have given you the land after all those
[1:12:35] Israelites saw of the power of God and
[1:12:39] goodness and deliverance of God they did
[1:12:42] not enter into rest which is the top of
[1:12:45] the Holy Ghost so you see right now that
[1:12:51] very few will ever believe all the way
[1:12:55] to receiving the Spirit of God
[1:13:03] are you gonna call them unbelievers we
[1:13:09] talk of a foolish version just give an
[1:13:12] example we talk of a foolish virgin
[1:13:19] great signs and wonders etc in all
[1:13:22] things among the foolish virgin we get
[1:13:24] to don't have the baptism in the Holy
[1:13:26] Spirit are you gonna call them
[1:13:32] unbeliever what are you gonna call them
[1:13:40] for later purposes we'll call them some
[1:13:43] that couldn't believe all the way for
[1:13:46] later purposes those that couldn't
[1:13:50] believe all the way or this wouldn't go
[1:13:52] all the way what about it well brother
[1:13:59] how do I know whether I'm called or not
[1:14:05] well that's why I ask you a simple
[1:14:07] question
[1:14:08] don't you remember somewhere in your
[1:14:10] life you better turn somewhere right I
[1:14:15] mean you made a turn somewhere to follow
[1:14:19] the Lord why don't you say count that as
[1:14:24] a day you started you remember the story
[1:14:28] of brother Branham told about the man
[1:14:30] that picked up the track and read it and
[1:14:33] says where he will you spend eternity he
[1:14:35] goes all over the nations he gets all of
[1:14:38] the great men to pray for him he goes
[1:14:40] through prayer lines he does everything
[1:14:42] they finally told him said you need to
[1:14:43] go down to William Branham and let him
[1:14:45] test you out hurts the guy went down the
[1:14:49] road around them and brother around him
[1:14:51] just talk to him and he said you
[1:14:54] remember when you picked up that track
[1:14:58] yeah he said it was solid right tire
[1:15:06] he said you mean to tell me I've had it
[1:15:09] all the time and didn't know it he said
[1:15:12] yeah violation could be a little bit
[1:15:16] different what we think we want the
[1:15:22] house something to do with it we just
[1:15:26] gotta have a little bit I didn't drink I
[1:15:30] didn't smoke I didn't run out with women
[1:15:38] and get her maybe that's why the Lord
[1:15:42] saved me
[1:15:45] well he's turned down a whole lot people
[1:15:48] it was a lot better off than that right
[1:15:52] but now are you thinking how do you know
[1:15:56] whether you're called or not that's the
[1:15:57] point we'll take just a few minutes
[1:16:01] because the whole point is called and
[1:16:04] chosen meteor call fewer chosen running
[1:16:10] that's the whole point so we've got to
[1:16:14] make our calling and election sure then
[1:16:19] we've got to have some way to find out
[1:16:26] well brother Li I know what I done I
[1:16:29] shove it now quote the Prophet once said
[1:16:36] this morning he said every denominations
[1:16:38] got their own in there one of those in
[1:16:40] there that called Methodist depended on
[1:16:42] shouting and he said a lot of shouted
[1:16:45] and didn't get to hold a gun do anything
[1:16:48] you named our C that's where we try to
[1:16:51] go to some form of something that we can
[1:16:57] think about us having something to do
[1:17:00] with it instead of thinking about God
[1:17:02] calling us
[1:17:11] instead of thinking about God working
[1:17:14] how they don't plan and purpose through
[1:17:16] you and me then he would choose us why
[1:17:22] did you marry the person you married we
[1:17:30] fell in love I've always told you the
[1:17:34] first marriage is generally nothing for
[1:17:35] love it's rather thought money or
[1:17:37] something else I don't agree with double
[1:17:39] marriages I'm just making a point why
[1:17:47] did you choose this message
[1:17:55] right now time do it God my wife or my
[1:17:57] husband made me do this out of the other
[1:17:58] my mama my daddy all right but don't you
[1:18:09] ever think about in your life or you met
[1:18:12] God and something you can think in your
[1:18:17] life that you you just I can remember
[1:18:20] that thing I can remember that situation
[1:18:23] that God was there and I saw it what
[1:18:33] made you that had the opportunities to
[1:18:36] be able to go to the tabernacle or
[1:18:38] wherever you went to hear the Prophet
[1:18:42] what made you do that now brother moe
[1:18:50] I liked him because one time I don't
[1:18:52] mean this wrong I mean brother mote was
[1:18:55] an honest man he'd tell you like it is
[1:18:58] the most everybody would say oh I wasn't
[1:19:01] letter the Lord to go I was letter to
[1:19:03] the Lord to do like you know brother
[1:19:06] mode he said I went to see the gift
[1:19:09] operate xxxii he said and then the
[1:19:16] looking into gift operates and we got
[1:19:18] caught by the word he's bringing now
[1:19:23] come on be honest that's right you went
[1:19:27] because of a gift you went because of
[1:19:29] these different things and then the word
[1:19:34] began to take hold and you begin to move
[1:19:40] on me how about it
[1:19:45] can you remember where you came from
[1:19:54] the I'm always told you know this I'm
[1:19:57] just playing and that's the way I go and
[1:19:59] I don't have to worry about anything
[1:20:00] else I like to brother branham we listen
[1:20:02] another night and he said a couple of
[1:20:03] times he said when you tell anything he
[1:20:06] said tell it to sign well again and you
[1:20:07] weren't worried about I said if you
[1:20:09] don't said you get the line about it
[1:20:11] yeah brother mote we started riding to
[1:20:16] work and he started talking about a
[1:20:19] great God he didn't talk about a prophet
[1:20:22] now he was good enough he didn't there's
[1:20:24] great God what do y'all believe huh I'm
[1:20:27] a Baptist
[1:20:30] there's word that the things come in you
[1:20:32] know that he would ask questions and in
[1:20:36] those questions a lot of times they were
[1:20:38] naturally trick questions to get us to
[1:20:41] answer but I told him one day I said
[1:20:46] Ramon I said you realize what's talking
[1:20:50] to me right now if I'd done it you'd be
[1:20:52] in bad shape
[1:20:54] he said what I said well for the down
[1:20:59] the road for the longest they'd been
[1:21:00] something tried to get me to run into a
[1:21:02] tree on your side the car are you stupid
[1:21:09] no I'm straight I tell it like it is rah
[1:21:14] cuz that something was telling me to do
[1:21:17] that but see just remember something in
[1:21:22] your life it'll help you for later in
[1:21:25] the messages we go along something in
[1:21:28] your life that you can direct everything
[1:21:30] toward and see we see most people wanted
[1:21:38] no one to do a lot of time maybe they
[1:21:41] don't know and a reason they don't but
[1:21:43] you see I always count myself to been
[1:21:48] someone who has a decent intelligence I
[1:21:51] didn't say smart
[1:21:52] I said decent intelligence and and I
[1:21:57] came to Baptist Church and I knew a lot
[1:22:00] of the doctrines of the Baptist Church I
[1:22:01] didn't have to learn it from brother
[1:22:02] Branham no he never taught me the
[1:22:04] doctrines of the Baptist Church
[1:22:06] I knew in the Baptist Church if he was
[1:22:08] baptized in that church if you joined
[1:22:10] that church he's gonna be baptized in
[1:22:12] that church no I mean it didn't no
[1:22:16] matter you go up join the church and do
[1:22:18] it you know but if you come from a
[1:22:20] Methodist Church over to the Baptist you
[1:22:22] gonna be baptized in that church you
[1:22:26] know you can go from the Baptist to the
[1:22:29] master this anywhere you want to go and
[1:22:30] it won't make you do it
[1:22:31] but the Baptist I don't know whether
[1:22:33] they still do that or not but I'm
[1:22:34] talking about fifty years ago a lot of
[1:22:37] things probably changed since then but
[1:22:39] that was the rule I was a deacon sitting
[1:22:41] there with it and knowing that those
[1:22:46] doctrines and things were there in that
[1:22:48] church the day I got baptized in the
[1:22:52] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I come up
[1:22:55] out of the water I said that song that
[1:22:58] you see I knew I knew the Scriptures was
[1:23:05] right I knew what he's saying was right
[1:23:09] there's no problems about the name of
[1:23:11] the Lord Jesus Christ my problem was
[1:23:14] knowing the day I did I was out of that
[1:23:17] church it was never to be that I could
[1:23:22] go back to that church without being re
[1:23:26] baptized the lot of you don't know you
[1:23:31] doctrines or where you came from but
[1:23:36] that was the Baptist doctrine so it was
[1:23:40] not dealing with me of whether or not
[1:23:42] the word was correct it was dealing with
[1:23:46] me to know and understand can I move on
[1:23:50] from here and today I left at the time I
[1:23:58] left I was teaching Sunday School
[1:24:00] classes and I was teaching a decent the
[1:24:02] deacons and elders of the church and
[1:24:05] them and their wives I had I think was
[1:24:07] five different positions I had to resign
[1:24:09] from I went home that evening
[1:24:14] had a no barbecue pit out in the
[1:24:16] backyard it we'd used it I made it that
[1:24:20] far I fell oh my knees and that's a god
[1:24:23] I know one thing for sure whether I'm
[1:24:29] going or what I'm going cause my mother
[1:24:31] came out with it you know and my brother
[1:24:33] the mother said where you going I said I
[1:24:35] don't know my brother said what are you
[1:24:38] going he said if you want to church will
[1:24:39] build you one he said we got enough in
[1:24:41] the family we could build a church I
[1:24:43] said but that ain't it
[1:24:45] it ain't whether I'm called a priest or
[1:24:47] not I've got to move on with the truth
[1:24:50] then I said that day and that I said
[1:24:53] I've cut off all ties I'm finished I
[1:24:58] can't go back unless I repent and get
[1:25:03] baptized father son hold of God you see
[1:25:09] I knew it was over with because he done
[1:25:11] solved the problem
[1:25:14] many of you have had experiences in your
[1:25:19] life of thinking about things that you
[1:25:22] can think about now how the Lord
[1:25:26] directed you or something happened or
[1:25:29] how did you end up in this message I
[1:25:33] mean wouldn't it something that brother
[1:25:35] MO and I could start riding to work
[1:25:36] again that was the way I wound up here
[1:25:42] in the message what about it
[1:25:49] you don't remember nothing you don't
[1:25:53] remember God dealing with you talking to
[1:25:56] you telling you you need to repent
[1:26:04] murder Brennan said you can have a call
[1:26:06] to simply in a minute I'll get to it
[1:26:07] he said you can say well I've got a call
[1:26:09] brother branham he said that can be true
[1:26:13] but he said nicely what was the words he
[1:26:16] used that was the greatest gimmick that
[1:26:19] Satan could use he actually says it and
[1:26:24] then he does what he said what I said I
[1:26:26] want to go about flip-flopping in this
[1:26:28] he said look then I'll find it in a
[1:26:34] minute but he said it like this
[1:26:36] he said the devil will tell you that
[1:26:43] you're not called
[1:26:50] he said when you are called now this is
[1:26:56] a flip-flop this hey he said in the
[1:26:58] devil will tell you he'll tell you your
[1:27:03] call when you're not called you tell
[1:27:08] you're not called when you are called
[1:27:10] and it is flip flop backwards before
[1:27:13] everything you try to figure out what
[1:27:15] the devil he's gonna have it over on you
[1:27:17] he's already been there and done that
[1:27:21] and like I've always tried to tell you
[1:27:24] we come up through the Baptist and I've
[1:27:26] seen it and watched it i watch so many
[1:27:29] young men especially walk the older line
[1:27:31] and a claim to be ministers called of
[1:27:34] God and I knew there was something wrong
[1:27:39] six months three months might make it a
[1:27:42] year and they'd be gone I said the Lord
[1:27:48] that's something I didn't understand
[1:27:52] that till I came in the message to get
[1:27:54] an understanding of that situation
[1:27:56] because you realize in the Baptist
[1:27:59] you've got everything when you believe
[1:28:01] that was the doctrine you got everything
[1:28:04] when you believe all right
[1:28:06] sure if God didn't with you what's he
[1:28:07] calling you to do what's the next step
[1:28:09] you didn't got all the salvation you
[1:28:11] need the next step was whether he was
[1:28:13] called to preach or not so he had a lot
[1:28:17] of young preachers that's what I'm
[1:28:20] saying the Prophet said we had nine
[1:28:22] hundred and something different
[1:28:23] denomination and that many of them
[1:28:25] telling you how to be born again or what
[1:28:27] to do in God or how to be led of God but
[1:28:33] you don't remember something in your
[1:28:35] life that you can relate back to
[1:28:40] something that's where you got started
[1:28:43] at
[1:28:50] the Prophet said very few will believe
[1:28:52] all the way under receiving the Spirit
[1:28:55] of God now here's the bigger catch what
[1:28:58] he'll tell you you're saved when you're
[1:29:01] not then if that don't get you here to
[1:29:03] you that you're lost you get you one way
[1:29:10] or the other you need to tell you you're
[1:29:11] saved or you'll take you long and he's a
[1:29:14] good guy at it he's real good
[1:29:16] you know don't don't ever think you are
[1:29:18] a match for how do you know whether
[1:29:23] you're called or not let's take one
[1:29:28] little second this is a thought you to
[1:29:31] think about
[1:29:38] the word always comes to the truly
[1:29:41] spirit-filled that is the evidence of
[1:29:45] being filled with the Holy Spirit this
[1:29:46] is Pergamon Church age it's on number 14
[1:29:49] if y'all want to roll over there this is
[1:29:52] what Jesus said would be the evidence he
[1:29:55] said I'll pray the father and he will
[1:29:57] send you another comforter that he may
[1:29:59] abide with you forever even the Spirit
[1:30:02] of Truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:30:05] how do you know whether you're called or
[1:30:08] not well number one take the thoughts
[1:30:12] that I've been for 15 minutes why are
[1:30:15] you here today why did you leave your
[1:30:20] denominational Church what did you leave
[1:30:25] your the churches and come in this
[1:30:27] message and I don't enter that out
[1:30:29] around the world or whatever what why
[1:30:34] don't you think about it is God calling
[1:30:35] you he called you to come to this
[1:30:40] message what more evidence what you want
[1:30:47] well I wrote a deal if I solvation and I
[1:30:50] spoke in tongues I shouted I cried that
[1:30:58] would have something to do with you that
[1:31:01] would not be the fact of being God
[1:31:03] choosing you and one of these days
[1:31:07] you'll realize one time that God chose
[1:31:11] you for a reason he had a reason to
[1:31:17] choose you and me if nothing else to be
[1:31:21] a good devil may I quote brother Branham
[1:31:23] if that's what he wants me to do I want
[1:31:26] to be a good one this is work
[1:31:35] but what about it what is the evidence
[1:31:39] of the holy spirit he said the evidence
[1:31:44] would be that you would be in the truth
[1:31:49] you would be in the Word of God for your
[1:31:52] age evidence has to do with receiving
[1:31:55] that word come on off the message broken
[1:32:03] cistern he said he was talking to
[1:32:07] somebody and said they said well what do
[1:32:09] you think is the evidence as it is into
[1:32:11] that he said I come up with the fact
[1:32:13] that it was love you remember that you'd
[1:32:15] only read it he said what God
[1:32:19] straightened me out in a vision what
[1:32:22] about God come into a prophet to
[1:32:24] straighten him out in a vision now may I
[1:32:28] say it without you getting the wrong
[1:32:30] idea what about God having to straighten
[1:32:33] the prophet out about what he thought
[1:32:35] the evidence was he was doing good would
[1:32:38] it be enough that was good
[1:32:41] with that wooden concrete do you thing
[1:32:47] what you want to until that time until
[1:32:48] the Lord showed it to him in a vision to
[1:32:50] straighten him out he wasn't right about
[1:32:52] the Holy Ghost evidence he had it right
[1:32:55] in the basis of knowing what it was and
[1:32:57] doing things yeah but he didn't have it
[1:32:59] right all the way it was a Holy Ghost
[1:33:02] straighten him out
[1:33:03] so the Holy Ghost said that the evidence
[1:33:06] of the spirit was those who would
[1:33:10] receive the word he said neither love
[1:33:12] not speaking in tongues but the
[1:33:15] receiving of the word how do you know
[1:33:19] whether you're called or not how about
[1:33:24] do you walk into work why are you not
[1:33:27] out there with everything else and may I
[1:33:31] say it would love and respect and all
[1:33:33] the God that I could think in my heart
[1:33:35] to cry what about all of these things in
[1:33:38] the message all the doctrines and ideas
[1:33:42] and perversions of the people of this
[1:33:44] message but yet you are able to walk
[1:33:47] right down the line of saying I don't
[1:33:51] believe that ice can go that away that's
[1:33:57] what I told the man with the to soul
[1:33:58] doctrine I talked to him he said come on
[1:34:02] up and preach for me I said well I can't
[1:34:05] do that anyway I work for a living and
[1:34:08] he said you know some things and I said
[1:34:12] listen brother I'm not saying you're
[1:34:14] wrong I said I'm just saying one time I
[1:34:18] can't see what you're saying to be the
[1:34:22] truth if you don't call that calling him
[1:34:25] wrong to lie or whatever you do is you
[1:34:27] do what you want to I was answering him
[1:34:28] as honest as I could from a sincere
[1:34:30] heart I said I just can't see it
[1:34:37] unless said Lord didn't tell me that so
[1:34:40] I can't believe it I've always been that
[1:34:45] way with everybody to try to be open and
[1:34:47] listen to doctrines and ideas of man
[1:34:50] kindness in this message but it's
[1:34:52] getting so now until it's it ain't even
[1:34:55] sensible to listen I'm as honest and who
[1:35:00] stated I ain't never said nothing about
[1:35:02] you listening nobody but I wonder how in
[1:35:04] the world you could listen to some of
[1:35:06] this it's on the junk of the message and
[1:35:08] come out of it was common sense and
[1:35:12] don't tell me you ain't affected with it
[1:35:16] don't tell me that I'm too old don't you
[1:35:22] tell me they can't do it I'm on quote
[1:35:24] brother branham he said the bride of
[1:35:26] Jesus Christ had no right going to Nasia
[1:35:30] that was that dire under the faith of
[1:35:33] the fathers and they went to Nicaea and
[1:35:37] he said they've brought away those times
[1:35:42] all it took was a little inroad and they
[1:35:46] brought it it's your business who you
[1:35:51] listen to and what you do but just
[1:35:53] remember it's also your business and
[1:35:56] responsibility
[1:35:58] of whether it's the truth or not and for
[1:36:02] your families why would you want your
[1:36:05] families to listen to the wrong time no
[1:36:12] problem
[1:36:13] I'm playing this could be if this ain't
[1:36:16] where you ought to be you let me know
[1:36:18] I'll try my best to give you some money
[1:36:20] to go somewhere the house
[1:36:21] I think tried to run nobody off when
[1:36:23] she's telling the truth I'm just telling
[1:36:26] it like it is
[1:36:28] cuz this is where I stand and what I
[1:36:30] stand on you can never approach the new
[1:36:38] parts with man's ideas
[1:36:48] your prophet said you believe unto
[1:36:55] eternal life
[1:37:02] he never throws nobody out he never put
[1:37:05] no church out into nothing he put the
[1:37:08] word down and let him think it over he
[1:37:15] said I can conclusively prove that you
[1:37:18] are born again by the new birth and
[1:37:21] baptized into the body of Jesus Christ
[1:37:26] then he firmly states there is no such
[1:37:30] thing as two comings of the Spirit
[1:37:41] let you think there's no such thing as
[1:37:45] to coming to the spirit he said they
[1:37:48] tried to prove that is to be an in the
[1:37:50] Bible which said it's not in the Bible
[1:37:52] said none of the Apostles ever told
[1:37:54] anything like that he said I understand
[1:38:01] a new birth I just made some statements
[1:38:08] do you understand
[1:38:15] but then I'm called a sarcastic arrogant
[1:38:18] hateful dirty old dude I'll take mine I
[1:38:22] probably fit in there somewhere
[1:38:24] I wouldn't know exactly where myself I
[1:38:27] just try to serve God and tried my best
[1:38:29] to preach this message to the people
[1:38:32] that would come and sit and listen but
[1:38:37] you got to make up your mind where you
[1:38:40] are in the word because they ain't no
[1:38:44] such thing
[1:38:47] yes us calling ourselves it's God
[1:38:52] calling us let's father what he calls us
[1:38:56] musicians come on there's a lot of
[1:39:00] things brother branham say it that you
[1:39:03] will say well he was right here wronged
[1:39:05] our great brother in this message
[1:39:12] questioning one time about Daniel 70
[1:39:14] weeks he said I'll take what brother
[1:39:19] Branham says in the sealed book over
[1:39:21] what he said in Daniel 70 would you
[1:39:27] answer that to what what the man was to
[1:39:29] say he was saying he is wrong the 70
[1:39:34] weeks right that see a book is that the
[1:39:41] way we think well yeah we were ready for
[1:39:44] the rapture the faith of the fathers
[1:39:48] never had that junk in it
[1:39:51] come on faith of the father's never had
[1:39:53] no problem with the Godhead and the
[1:39:55] thing they had it right now I've always
[1:40:02] told you and I don't mind saying this
[1:40:04] whatsoever because I've taught it for 40
[1:40:06] years ever person in the world could
[1:40:12] have the new birth every person in the
[1:40:17] world could have the faith of the
[1:40:18] fathers standing where Paul was and
[1:40:21] there's no rapture be a wonderful world
[1:40:24] and live in with no rapture you tell me
[1:40:27] where I'm wrong
[1:40:30] why didn't it come back there the
