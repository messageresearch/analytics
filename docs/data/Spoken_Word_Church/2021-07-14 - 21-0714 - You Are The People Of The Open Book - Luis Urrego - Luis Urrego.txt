hopefully it'll it'll it'll help you amen because how many believe that you are the bride of christ amen how many believe praise the lord no matter how chaotic the world is and certainly we're living in really crazy times where now everything if you say it's up they say it's down if you say it's down they say it's up and no matter how much science you give them you know they say well you don't

it's the word amen he is the the absolute and no matter who says what god never fails and i'm so thankful for that amen if you want to turn with me to the book of nehemiah chapter 8 nehemiah chapter 8. praise god i want to talk this evening about you are the people of the open book amen you are the people of the open book praise the lord nehemiah chapter 8. let's just go to the lord in prayer this evening our gracious lord jesus we thank you for your love your mercy and grace upon us father we appreciate lord for the opportunity to open back father the pages of this open book lord jesus father god for certainly this book has been opened lord god amen lord people out here lord they can open it physically but it doesn't mean that it's necessarily open to them lord father god there's a people lord jesus that you've opened this book up for father and it's only those lord god that can actually take it father god and eat that book lord god and digest it and and chew it father lord it's for them lord god to them this book has been opened and we thank you for the revelation of your word in this hour lord appreciate lord touching brother dale lord may you continue to strengthen our brother lord god may you continue to help him father god and lord we believe father god that healing lord god is happening even at this very moment for you are the source of healing lord god and

just watch over them keep them lord god brother joe and his family there lord god you just watch over them lord god and lord we just thank you and we commit this time into your hands for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ that we pray amen amen praise the lord nehemiah chapter 8 and all the people gathered themselves verse 1 and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the watergate and they spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which the lord had commanded to israel now to go just to go back just for a moment this was israel when they came back to the land of the promised land or to to israel to jerusalem after they had been in captivity uh in babylon for a long time and so being in captivity for such a long time they forgot their customs that a lot of the customs and the law that moses had given them uh they had not even opened the the the the bible really pretty much is how you boil it down and they forgot the customs so when this book was restored back to them the law of moses was restored back to them i want you to see and i want you to notice how the people how they reacted to it and how and how important it was to them and so it says here in verse 1 and they spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which the lord had commanded to israel and ezra the priests brought the law before the congregation both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first day of the seventh month what it what what a number the key number there and he read therein before the street that was before the watergate from the morning until midday my he just read the he just read the bible for several hours before the man and the women and those that could understand and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law my and ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him stood ma matathaya and shema and ananiah anaya and nurija and hilkiah and masaya on his right hand and on his left hand padaya and mishael and malkaya and hashem and badana and zechariah and muslim and ezra verse 5 and ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people all right for he was above all the people in other words it was not just his position but but also where he was standing at the same at he was higher than them at the moment they were looking to him for leadership and when he opened it all the people stood up and ezra blessed the lord the great god and all the people answered amen amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed their heads and worshiped the lord with their faces to the ground amen may the lord add a blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated amen i wanted to start with this scripture because it gives us an example of when the book of the word of god was opened amen and how and how it was such a a a time of rejoicing for the people i don't know about you but uh some of us haven't experienced it but maybe you've you don't know what it is like to be out in the world and we know that babylon babylon represents the world you know and i've been there you know you go out and you get away from the things of god for a while and you realize that you're like a misfit out in the world you don't belong in there because the word of god has you've opened that book at some point in time or that book has been opened to you at some point in time uh uh i i know brother wade can attest to this and then you realize that even though you're out there in the world even though you're partaking of the things of the world you don't real you really don't belong you feel like you don't belong with there with them you just can't really get into what they do because you know better right and and i say this to all of us young people you think right now that you're okay everything's fine and and you're going to where you're going and and and and that's that's fine but if god gets a hold of you you will never be the same amount you will never be the same you realize you will realize i don't belong in this this is not where i'm supposed to go because you know better yeah i was that way amen and when and and you feel like you're out there with your drinking buddies you're out there doing these things of the world and then and then you feel like my goodness what am i doing you know they're cursing like a sailor they're doing all these things listening to the worldly music the hip-hop the rap and all that kind of stuff and you think that you're one of them but something is telling you're not really one of them you think that you are but you really are not god will make that known to you amen amen praise god because let me tell you if your true child son and daughter of god god won't leave you alone i'm thankful that he doesn't yes i'm thankful god will not leave your goal you will come back to the place where you are manifesting him instead of manifesting the things of the world amen god will make sure that you that you will manifest him amen i don't know who needed that but somebody did and it didn't cost you one ten one cent praise god amen so we are the people of the open book amen praise the lord jesus now as the people of the open book you know as i was saying you know there's people out here the nominal world they read the bible the same bible that you and i do yet it's not open to them i've had them tell me well you know when you try to explain to them water baptism in the name of lord jesus christ and you give them matthew 28 but then you also give them acts 2 38 and and you and you try to bring it to the together to them and there's something that they say well i'd rather take the words of jesus yeah instead of what peter said like it's two different types of words and isn't that what they're kind of saying today even the people that have left this word this message oh i'd rather just take the bible i'd rather take instead of the instead of the prophet and that's actually worse yeah amen they have seen what the prophet has said for them to come and say i'll just take the bible they have not what what has happened is is they have seen the word open and they have rejected that open word right that's right and they say we got the we got i'll just take the bible i'll just take christ but you see christ has to be revealed it ain't just the letter of the bible it has to be a living word amen a living word and you and i praise god and it was i i i don't know of of any other man amen in this our day where that word was vindicated more than our prophet brother branham amen god vindicated this message amen in many different ways and they just they fall flat on on on a vision the brown bear vision the bridge all these different things with and none of those things bring me salvation none of them the opening of the word brings me salvation the seven seals brings me salvation and brother branham was they cannot dispute that though they won't come back against that but they'll talk about brown veg brown bear they'll talk about a bridge and all this than that and that won't ever give anybody the holy ghost amen praise god amen amen so we know that the word of god from genesis to revelation saints we know that the central theme and brother wade and brother dale they've covered these things but we're just going to go back through and we know that the central theme of the word of god is redemption amen praise god and we see redemption even in the in in in in women in the bible such as rahab ruth esther amen those are all representations of redemption praise god and you know that that it's interesting that they were all women amen they were all women and and and who redeemed them right it was their husbands that redeemed them right amen you know the story of rahav and she married with the captain of israel that was a marriage that was a a marriage that took place it was her husband that redeemed her same thing with ruth even though she was a moabitess she was a gentile she came and she could only be redeemed amen by the near kinsmen and the one that was the most nearest to her which was uh uh um i forgot his name but um um no bo boaz but there was a no another one that was nearer to her i don't think the bible says the name so but we know that he represents the devil he was our near kinsmen but he couldn't redeem us and so boaz stepped in and he said well i'll do it amen praise god amen and we see the same thing with esther amen she was married to uh the king and uh she was she she was a representation of redemption praise god amen and when you look at and you go back home and you read the book of ruth amen you look at uh for example at chapter 2 of of of ruth you see how boaz he reveals to her her life amen and they're in chapter two he he starts talking to her about her about where she come from i believe brother wade was mentioning this sunday how how he i i have heard of the things that you've done where you came from and all these things and wasn't that the same thing that took place at the the woman at the whale man amen the woman at the well that came to jesus jesus was talking to her revealing to her her life amen revealing to her who she was but you know what as much as as as boaz was revealing to to uh to ruth her life and as much as as jesus was revealing to the woman at the will of her life that did not bring redemption to their life see because ruth still had to go through a process amen and we see that process amen unveils itself amen as you read continue reading through the book of ruth amen and uh uh in the in the later chapters and we'll touch on it here in just a moment but i want you i want us to look at here for just a moment here in in luke chapter four uh in luke chapter four the brothers could bring it up uh speaking about this open book and how brother wade was kind of bringing this this th this past sunday amen but jesus amen he's here in the synagogue and the bible says in verse 16 and it says and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah isaiah's and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord amen and he stops there amen he stops there now i just want to throw this in here for just a moment just to kind of uh uh uh to kind of i guess back up what brother wade was saying on sunday uh but uh you know brother branham calls that the the the greatest anointing that ever existed was right there in that scripture right there and they're in there in luke and brother and brother branham says here in the message why are people so tossed about he says some people gets the wrong impression of what the anointing is did you ever think of that when when was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone and what did they do when they had the anointing the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was jesus christ now he is the holy ghost he is the spirit amen so he is the greatest anointing we have the spirit by measure he says he had it without measure and one day he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll and read said the spirit of god is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the acceptable year to bind up the broken hearts to heal the sick give sight to the blind and now we would think if such anointing was on him had been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the lord upon him we would have want to run all over the building scream and holler amen all right so we know that that wasn't the case with jesus amen right jesus wasn't running and and and and screaming and hollering and all that none of that is bad i want you to understand that there's nothing wrong with that amen right there is a balance amen and also it depends on our makeup as well some of us are not that way yeah some of us are amen and so we express and we worship god in whatever way god made us amen amen but have something to shout about amen all right have something to to to to run about have something to jump about amen don't just make it just just i i feel good and that's it and there's no word behind it you make sure that the word is backing up your shouting you make sure that the word is backing up you're you're running you make sure that the word is backing up any any externals amen praise god amen amen so but brother branham continues and says here but the bible said he laid down the scroll and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth all right that's when jesus closed the book and he started explaining what that what that what the scripture was about that's what he done under the anointing the anointing is not emotion now brother brown did not say that the emotion was bad he just said that it wasn't the emotion you can't say that anointing is just emotion amen because brother brother uh jesus christ amen was the greatest and he was the greatest anointed at that moment when he opened back that's that book you see that's right all right he done the he says that's what he done under the anointed the anointing is not in motion watch what the anointing is the anointing is supreme power in control all right what is the anointing the anointing is supreme power in control amen amen amen knowing how to control amen at the moment amen how to dividely write rightly divide the word exactly when it needs to be done amen right amen not not not speaking just because you feel like it that's right because sometimes we do that yeah we just just i feel like saying it and then you do so much damage by doing that you may or may not but we have to that's supreme power under control now i believe that when you and i receive the holy ghost we receive supreme power amen but we also got to make sure that that supreme power is controlling us from the inside out amen praise god the anointing is not in motion the anointing is supreme power in control knowing exactly what and how amen amen praise god that that's a powerful quote amen praise god knowing exactly what and how now saints you may go through several months and you may not even feel or even cry one time that does not mean that you have the right to doubt what god has done in your life if god has really done a work in your heart in your life you know that god is changing you from day to day whether you jumped whether you shouted whether you screamed whether you sang really loud whatever it doesn't matter if you did that or not god is still on the scene amen amen you've got to realize because satan will try to make us think well i didn't run and i didn't shout i haven't done that and i haven't even cried well i pray in several months it must mean god is not with me amen god is just might be trying to test you trying to and see what you're what you're going to do about it are you going to hold that holy ghost that's in you in supreme control amen because really it's the holy ghost that holds you amen praise god the anointing is supreme power in control amen amen you go back and you read that go back home and read that again amen amen now continuing here and reading in luke chapter 4 and and verse 20 and it says and and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister jesus gave it the book again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears now jesus knew exactly what he was talking about for one he was the one who wrote the word he was the one who wrote that portion in isaiah actually gave it to isaiah to speak it right right but now i want you to understand that jesus did not complete all of his work while here on earth that's right amen and we may have heard all these things but he didn't complete all these things that's the reason why there was another portion there in isaiah that he could have continued if he would have read if he would have continued reading he would have read another portion but it wasn't his time to fulfill that part he only read the part that he was to fulfill at that moment when he was fulfilling praise god and so god a man he is he is he is a a god who is ever present amen he is here to fulfill his word amen but he will not do it amen faster than what he needs to or all slower than what he needs to amen it's exactly when it needs to be done amen no no no no no further no no no less amen praise god now brother branham was the one that says this he says in if you read in the pergament church he says those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus said the lord or they keep still that's right they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he says he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so what so now he works in and through the bride satan hates that amen but the bride loves that satan hates that she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do amen but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time amen how many believe that amen can isn't it awesome to be part of this word amen that you are now fulfilling in this hour you are that other part of the scripture that jesus didn't read praise god amen and i know we've all heard these things amen but sometimes you know it's good to come back and and look at our positions in the word amen because satan uh would like to make us look at other things we'd like to keep our eyes focused on other things outside externals and we forget who we are we forget what god has done for us we forget the the the work that god has been doing in our lives and that we have the greater works and we are powerful you have more power laying within you than even satan could ever imagine having and that's the power that he's been wanting this whole time think about that he's been wanting that and you have the secret because he doesn't have the open book you do praise god as a matter of fact you are the open book amen not just have the book you are the open book we'll just look at that here in just a moment amen in chapter three of ruth uh uh we see that uh that ruth she lays at the feet of boaz amen so so it it even even at the woman at the well even though jesus told her about all her life told her her husbands that she had and and revealed all those things to her the woman at the will still had to wait for calvary she still had to go to calvary she still had to accept self receive salvation in her life and and so i i just look at that at ruth amen laying at the feet of buzz it's like a type of of the death of christ us laying at the foot of the cross amen amen there's there's a process amen of salvation there's a process that we must go through amen of justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost amen and without it there's not you can't be saved you can you can't be fully redeemed without those three processes you have to have those in your life amen you can't skip one amen and say that you're fully redeemed amen ruth had to go through all these processes in order to come to her full redemption amen and i believe that the woman at the well she was there at pentecost amen that's just me personally the bible doesn't say but just me personally thinking because god did something great in her life jesus did something great in her life and i believed that as she was running to tell others hey man she ran over to the to the to the uh uh to the uh to the there at the uh at the day of pentecost i believe she ran there she was there amen because god did something for her and then if you read there in in ruth chapter four ruth is there you see that ruth is redeemed there by boaz and no one else could redeem ruth amen uh even though she had a closer kinsmen and and and we saw that now in the redemption process there in ruth if you read there we know we see there that in verse 11 there of chapter four and it says and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we are witnesses the lord make the woman that is come into thine house like rachel and like leah which two did build the house of israel and do thou worthily in ephrata and be famous in bethlehem in other words when the redemption process when he announced that he was redeeming ruth amen the people around him amen they were they were uh uh they were congratulating him they were they were giving him uh praise amen for what this great thing that he had done amen and and and it was the same thing when when jesus when he read and he opened the book there in in the synagogue amen people were were were wondering well they were astonished by the words they were they were hearing they were even asking wasn't this just the the son of the of the of joseph the carpenter you know they started expressing themselves what they feel when the book was opened amen when redemption came in on the picture and we see this the same thing took place if you read in revelations chapter 5. amen i want us to look at revelations chapter 5. amen for just a moment amen revelations chapter 5. and it's interesting that in revelations is revelation chapter 5 the number five number of grace yeah that's right amen let's just read this here for just a moment amen you love the lord amen amen praise god and i saw the in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals so this book was sealed and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon there was nobody able to to open this book that that that that that was closed now this book saints is the book that actually adam lost amen there in the garden of eden the book that adam was supposed to come to a place where for a redemption of his body now he was a son of god he had eternal life amen but he did not have eternal life in his flesh and that's what he was that's why he needed that tree of life there to continue eating from the tree of life and eventually he would come to that point amen now the book amen has been redeemed to us and we'll see here in just a moment it's been restored that book that adam uh uh gave up amen the book a book of redemption that adam gave up for the for for the knowledge of of worldly knowledge brother branham says amen you can read these things in in in in revelations uh in the first seal brother brown talks about these things and and he gave up for for satan's worldly knowledge and he lost everything amen and now jesus came back amen and and he restored amen this this book now if we continue reading it says in verse 3 and no man in heaven not nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i wept much this was john because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david the hath prevailed to open the book and not just to open it but to lose the seven seals thereof amen and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb now here john was told that the lion of the tribe of judah was the one that was worthy to open the book but when john heard this and he turned around what he saw was a lamb he was he thought that it was supposed to be a lion because that's what he was told when he turns around he sees a lamb and not just any lamb look what the bible says and and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain in other words it was bloody it was it was it was torn it was it was it was it was ripped yeah it was not a pretty sight right jesus's death wasn't a pretty sight i think i said this last time amen the uh uh the the mel gibson's movie amen the passion of the christ doesn't even do it justice that's that doesn't even scratch the surface of how jesus looks and it looks bad in the movie if you've seen the movie amen jesus it was much worse than that amen not to mention that he was hanging before people hanging before the people naked amen nude you know we always see them see him that he's got a little a little cloth around him and he didn't even have that fully exposed that's what a lamb is before a pastor before you're fully exposed to the to the elements of the world you're fully exposed to the to the dangers of the world you're fully exposed to everyone and that's the reason why we've got to have the shepherd the great shepherd to lead us amen because the same lamb amen that died for us he's the same one that leads us amen he's our pastor he's our shepherd amen we can't depend on ourselves we've got to be led if we are true sheep if we are true lambs amen praise god and i beheld and lo in verse 5 and one of the elders said unto me well where am i oh verse 6 and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth we could be here all evening talking about those different things but we'll just move on and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne amen and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints and watch what they did they were doing the exact same thing that what that took place when ruth was redeemed amen when jesus opened the book the exact same thing is taking place praise is given forth it comes forth and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred and and tongue and people and nation look what it says there in verse 9 and for thou slain and has redeemed us amen to god amen by the blood redeemed amen there we see the complete plan of redemption right there amen taking place before us and it wasn't it wasn't the lion although it was but it was a lamb amen a lamb that redeems us praise god and has made us unto our god kings and priests and watch him we shall reign on the earth amen praise the lord see you are kings and priests in this hour saints amen brother branham says in the first seal and as as i mentioned earlier you can read that yourselves and he says john turning he saw a lamb coming out he must have been bloody and cut and wounded it had been slain uh said that a lamb that had been slain and of course uh it was still bloody if you if you had cut the lamb and killed it the way that lamb was anyhow it was hacked to pieces on a cross spears in the side and nails in the hands and feet and thorns over the brow he was in an awful condition and this lamb come forth and went over to him that set upon the throne that held the complete title deed of redemption what adam lost amen the lamb regained for us amen restored and the lamb goes and takes the book out of the hand of him that set up on the throne and was took and opened the seals and open the book praise god amen and we'll continue here reading in just a moment but you know what saints i want you to keep in mind that it wasn't brother branham that opened the seals it wasn't wasn't the prophet brother branham when he preached when he was going to preach the seals he was going to preach the exact same way that he preached them in the early 50s but it but it was god that intervened the angel of the lord came in there amen every day amen and told them this is this this is this this is this and if it wasn't for that amen we would still have a closed book amen it wouldn't be an open book for us it'd still be closed even though we read the literal word we read the text we read in john chapter five what happened but many people throughout the ages they they they looked and they probed at john i'm sorry revelations chapter five and those different things and they they they just guessed amen but we see the full opening of the book now praise god brother branham continues on saying it says and then when that had happened we found out there must have been a great something took place in heaven for the elders and the four and twenty elders and the beasts and everything in heaven began to cry worthy and and here come the angels and poured out the vows of the prayers of saints the saints under the altar screamed out worthy art thou o lamb for you have redeemed us and now you have made us kings and priests and we shall rule on the earth oh my and that's so when he opened that book amen amen praise god amen so i say this saints to to to to bring bring it down to to this point because i want us to go now to revelations chapter 10. revelations chapter 10. now that was revelations chapter 5 and we know that 5 is the number of grace so it's interesting that revelations chapter 10 is 5 plus 5 equals 10. uh i call it the double you get that double grace because what was at the cap what was that the mount what was it the capstone it wasn't just grace it was grace grace you get that double grace amen so here is revelations chapter 10. now that the book had been ope had been redeemed amen and in revelation chapter 10 here stands the lamb amen with the open book amen in his hand and his right hand yeah now i call it double double because uh in canada there's a there's a chain of of of of uh of stores there of of it's like it's like starbucks but i mean it's it's a coffee coffee place and it's and it's called tim hortons i don't know if you ever heard of it before and if you want a coffee there with two sugars i believe and and two creamers you say i want a double double amen so i just thought you know double double double grace amen that's when it tastes good i don't want just grace i want double grace i need double grace amen the crapstone is crying grace grace amen praise god not just grace but double grace so that leads us to revelations chapter 10 amen and it says and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and and i like what brother wade was saying there on sunday that how god hid this amen because that angel there is it's lower case a but we know that that's christ amen amen the mighty angel came down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire amen now you see here in the end time we see that that that's the true meaning of what the rainbow is amen it's not what the world tells you it is that's a perversion of it perversion of the rainbow i would say this young people do not believe what they tell you out here in the in in the schools because we we see some trying times ahead of us they're going to start changing curriculums in schools they're going to start changing your mindset of of of accept certain lifestyles and accept certain ways and things like that and and i've i've expressed this to my to my children and parents i believe that we must be even more vigilant now than ever you you cannot depend on the teachers that the teachers all they can do is just say what they're told to say now you have to fill in those gaps because they're there to satan is going to try to destroy your children he is there amen satan wants to this wants to take your children in seed form that's why he's uh that's what we see all this abortion and all these things you see it's a seed and if satan can destroy amen in seed form he doesn't there's no chance for that seed to grow that's why he tries he's he's he's attacking our children more than ever nowadays amen amen just because the government said so or just because school such and such said so doesn't make it so amazing doesn't make it true amen the word is true amen that's what we do that's what we lean upon amen i don't care who says what and one day amen we they may close our church down because of the way we see things the way we believe amen and the way we come against these things but i'm certainly not going to stand for certain things that they believe out there amen you as parents amen you have to at some point you're going to have to put your foot down and say listen i'm not allowing this in my in my home right i'm not allowing this type of mindset in my family because they'll they're coming sneakingly for you to kind of be appeased for those certain lifestyles and all those different things it's just so sneak how sneak how they're sneaking that in your life and you just have to be on the guard in this hour and for those they're the older younger people amen and those who you're thinking about marriage and things like that these are things that you have to look at you're going to have to face them even worse than we are right now if if time if time allows it that's right we're living in a perverse world praise god so that is what the meaning of the rainbow really is there in verse two and it says and he had in his hand the little book opened so we know that this book amen it was it was open already we see it uh opened in revelations chapter five amen and he set this right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cloud and crowd with a loud voice and when a lion as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders utter their voices amen now it wasn't just he was just the lamb the meek lamb that was slain amen now he's coming in judgment amen as a lion praise god and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write said john and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not amen praise god and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that their their therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer now watch but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets now a lot of people just leave it there it's finished but now there's a part that we must took that we must partake in amen that we must exercise and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book now look what it says go and take the little book not just a little book but go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth so it's up to you and i saints in this hour to go and take the book amen brother dale he can't force you to go take the book brother wade can't do it nobody else can do it amen it's got to be you to go take that book it's got to be you amen to get in the word amen it's got to be you to get a revelation for yourself praise god even god can't give you a force of revelation upon you if you don't want it it's got to be him to do it it's got to be you you've got to want for him to do it amen so what god is what what god is telling what what the angel is telling john to do here in revelations chapter 10 was the exact same thing that the lamb did in revelations chapter 5. say that again what god is telling john to do amen here in revelation 10 is what the lamb did in revelations chapter five good took and took the book amen so everything that jesus did the life that he lived the the the things that happen as the head goes so does the rest of the body amen praise god i've said it before when you wake up in the morning when you wake up from your bed amen usually it's your head that gets up first then it's the rest of the body right normally it can't be the other way around amen yeah i guess sometimes the most we've fallen out of bed you know and our feet touch the ground first amen but normally it's our head that gets up amen jesus was the first fruits of the resurrection amen because he lives i can live as well because he lives i can face tomorrow amen because he raised in triumph and victory amen all power was given unto him both in heaven and earth praise god i have that same power you and i praise god amen and we know that john here in revelation chapter 10 he's a type of the bride amen now watch in verse 9 and i went unto the angel and this is john speaking and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book amen amen and he said unto me take it i can't you know he just can't give it to you amen you've got to take it amen amen you've got to take it and eat it up not just take it but eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth's sweetest honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter amen and he said unto me watch thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations in tongues and kings and what verse is that verse 11. i don't think that's there just to be there that's the hour that we're living in saints that's you and i in this hour amen thou must prophesy again before must there's no way around it we must prophesy again in this hour we look at if we look at the that word prophesy is the greek word prophet prophetio prophetic you i think the brothers can bring that up and it's watch to foretell advance divine to speak under inspiration amen that's just not for a preacher it's just not for me or for brother dale for brother wade amen you sisters have a part to speak this word amen amen praise god you young people you have a part to speak this word amen amen exercise the prophetic office prophesy that's in the strong concordance now in the thayer's dictionary that same thing it says uh it says to utter forth declare a thing which can only be known by divine revelation so before you speak you have to it has to be revealed to you amen under like prompting to teach refute reprove admonish and comfort others amen praise god so you can't do none of those things unless the comforter is in you amen i can't comfort you unless the comforter is in there praise god what did jesus tell the tell peter amen when you get converted peter then you go strengthen your brethren amen but we can't strengthen one another amen when you're not even converted amen when you don't even want to one you don't you're not even god's not even dealing in your life you can't help somebody else spiritually praise god amen now this this here in john in in revelation chapter 10 ties in directly with ezekiel chapter 3 amen where ezekiel eats the eats the role amen there in ezekiel in ezekiel chapter 3 verse 1 it says moreover he said unto me son of man eat that thou find us eat this roll and go speak unto the house of israel so before you go speak you must eat the roll not just he eat the book amen i opened my mouth verse two so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll verse three and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this roll that i give thee then did i eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness so it was the same thing that john experienced is the same thing that ezekiel experienced here and he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house of israel and speak with my words unto them praise god amen so the book has to be had to already been open in order for you to be able to go eat it fully and you go speak the words amen praise god now in verse in amos chapter 3 verse 7 through 8 brother brother wade's been reading this uh last several verses it says surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets verse 8 the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord god hath spoken who can but prophesy and you know if you look at those two verses there they kind of tie in with revelations chapter 10 verse 7 and 8. amen amen where it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be re we should be finished see god is not going to do nothing unless he reveals it to his servants the prophets first amen and we've seen that in our day amen the lion hath roared amen we saw that in revelations chapter 10 at the beginning amen he cried with a loud voice amen and who will not fear the lord god has spoken who can but prophesy amen amen you can't do nothing but prophesy when this word is in you amen and what is prophesying amen is is speaking or or or even if you look at that word prophesy in the hebrew it says to speak or sing by inspiration so you can speak amen or you can sing by inspiration amen that's that's a problem that's a prophecy right that's like prophesying amen doesn't necessarily mean just like a like a way a prophet the way we look at our prophet but prophesying is like speaking his word amen you have that that authority in this hour saints if the word is in you amen praise god amen praise the lord let's just read this here in in in in the uh church age book amen now this is a little lengthy but but just look at what brother branham says here the word of promise came to the virgin mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest god was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message speaking of the virgin mary amen but the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her amen so jesus amen so god did exactly what he needed to do he fulfilled his word amen when he gave his word to mary amen and that word was fulfilled in mary's life amen and what did she say be it unto me according to thy word amen that's like you eating the book amen lord you said it i believe it that settles it amen that's like you taking the whole book amen the members of the virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads that's why the head of the head wherever the head moves that's where the body goes it'd be kind of weird if you know if you were looking this way but your body's trying to move this way amen notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father john 5 19. watch this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary the full word the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what she wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass that's why you have to receive the word first then that word has to be quickened amen there is never been a a new birth to take place without the word first being that's that's part of the ingredients amen a full knee birth has to be there in with by the word the word has to be preached first like a seed that is planted in water it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus said the lord or they keep still amen so we read this earth just a little bit ago amen praise god so saints you are the people of the open book second corinthians chapter 3 verse 2 tells us ye are our pistol written in our hearts known and read of all men amen amen if we have the open book amen in our lives amen that's what we must be expressing that's right you can't say you have the open book amen and be expressing something different it has to be amen what did what was john gonna do when he ate the book the same thing that the lamb did the same thing that the lion did express him amen verse three there in second corinthians and we're finished with this for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink amen so in other words there's nothing carnal man but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart that's where that word wants to abide in such trust have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god now watch verse 6 who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life amen so this has nothing to do with you need the letter man we gotta read the word we gotta have the letter in order to obtain get to a revelation praise god but um if you you can have the letter a lot of people have the letter but they don't have the spirit backing it up and it doesn't produce the life amen so that's like uh you know if john was eating that book amen you can eat the book but it has to be the open book amen right it would be different if john was eating that book and that book not be open right it'd be different then he would not be able to manifest fully what took place in revelations chapter 5. amen but that book was open and that's the reason why john could eat it and john being our type amen type in the bride amen amen we do the same in this hour saints praise god amen you must eat the book amen you must you must be the book amen amen not just eat it but be the book in this hour praise god and the book is open no matter what they tell you no matter what anybody says amen i don't care what anybody says or somebody it could have been the greatest person that that even preached this message the book is open amen this word has been has been vindicated amen thoroughly vindicated amen amen and and you just watch there's a lot of spirits out there a lot of luring spirits amen but you watch those people's lives afterwards right and and you realize if they ate the open book they'd be expressing the open book right but you see their lives and you see the way they go and it's totally contrary to the open book amen that's right so you make sure we we we feed off the open book amen i'm gonna cut it off there we're gonna cut off early let's stand to our feet praise the lord let's have the musicians come you are the people of the open book praise god amen let's just bow our heads our gracious lord jesus we thank you father god for your love your mercy and grace unto us father we we appreciate lord god that you open father god back your word lord
