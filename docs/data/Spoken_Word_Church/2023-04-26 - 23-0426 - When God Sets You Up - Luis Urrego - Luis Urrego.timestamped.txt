[8:02] you have your way in this service we
[8:03] pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[8:06] praise God Matthew chapter 15 starting
[8:10] at verse 21 it says then Jesus went
[8:13] thence and departed into the coast of
[8:15] tire and sidon
[8:17] and behold a woman of Canaan came out of
[8:20] the same coasts and Cried unto him
[8:22] saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son
[8:27] of David my daughter is grievously vexed
[8:30] with a devil
[8:32] but he answered her not a word
[8:35] and his disciples came and besought him
[8:38] saying send her away for she crieth
[8:41] after us but he answered and said I am
[8:45] not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
[8:48] House of Israel
[8:50] then came she and worshiped him saying
[8:53] Lord help me amen you may be seated
[9:01] praise the Lord
[9:03] amen this afternoon I just want to take
[9:05] a little topic and I just want to call
[9:06] it when God sets you up
[9:08] amen when God sets you up how many have
[9:11] been set up before
[9:13] or have you set someone up
[9:18] it's not a good feeling
[9:20] you know we we have uh maybe we have
[9:23] different testimonies or different
[9:25] experiences you know brother Brandon was
[9:27] set up one time
[9:28] when he was when he came there with the
[9:31] ministers there in Chicago and uh they
[9:34] set him up for a trap and um but uh God
[9:39] knew amen what they were doing I
[9:41] remember one time when we first came
[9:43] into the message we were so excited
[9:45] about the message and about the word and
[9:47] and uh when we had come out of the
[9:50] Baptist Church we had some friends there
[9:51] that were very skeptical of why we had
[9:55] left and and so they invited us to their
[9:57] house and they told us they said hey we
[10:00] want us to tell you tell us about this
[10:02] this Prophet about brother Branham and
[10:04] and coming and tell us about the message
[10:07] so my dad and me we went over there and
[10:10] and they were friends of ours there at
[10:12] the Baptist Church we got there we were
[10:14] genuinely thought that they really
[10:16] wanted to hear about the message but
[10:18] when we got there they had they had a
[10:20] man there from one of the Baptist
[10:22] Churches there in Greenville South
[10:23] Carolina and he we were not expecting
[10:26] him to be there he was a he was a
[10:28] creature and so we started talking my
[10:31] dad and me started explaining some
[10:33] things to them what we knew at the time
[10:35] and uh all of a sudden he starts he
[10:38] starts speaking up and say he just kind
[10:40] of took over the whole thing after that
[10:44] um and it was just a surprise for us
[10:45] because really what it was is that they
[10:47] were trying to set us up for a trap
[10:49] because this man was a theologian
[10:52] and so my dad and me we we uh you know
[10:55] we gave him some books we gave him some
[10:57] tracks I remember right before we left
[10:59] their their house that day and we were
[11:02] just downtrodden my dad and me you know
[11:04] because there we were so excited about
[11:06] hey we were going to talk to tell them
[11:09] about the the word of God tell them
[11:10] about the message and here we are
[11:13] they're just telling us how wrong we are
[11:15] and through this man and I remember
[11:17] going to the restroom that afternoon or
[11:19] right before we left their house and uh
[11:22] all the books and the tracks and
[11:24] everything that we had given them where
[11:25] they were already in the trash can there
[11:27] in the restroom
[11:28] so it was it was a trap it was a setup
[11:32] but you know God has this God knows
[11:35] exactly amen who's going to receive his
[11:37] word and who's not amen the only
[11:39] responsibility that we have is just to
[11:41] be a light to people amen and and tell
[11:44] them wait and then your duty bound to
[11:46] answer when someone asks you questions
[11:48] amen your duty bound to and if you don't
[11:52] know how then I'm afraid you need to get
[11:54] in the word then if you if you say well
[11:57] you need to talk to my pastor you need
[11:59] to talk to such and such you need to get
[12:01] in the word yourself if you don't know
[12:02] how to explain the word yourself that's
[12:05] a problem I think if you say you're a
[12:07] Christian especially if you're being a
[12:09] Christian for many years and you don't
[12:11] know how to explain basic salvation to
[12:13] people or how to receive the holy ghost
[12:15] that is a big problem so I I think I
[12:19] think that you need to do something
[12:21] about that but anyways so when God sets
[12:24] us up amen there's we've all been set up
[12:26] at one point in time and and uh uh and
[12:30] but God you know God also sets sets sets
[12:33] us up and it's not it's not to do us any
[12:35] wrong amen but I believe God sets you up
[12:38] Amen in order to bring something out of
[12:40] you amen that wouldn't have come out in
[12:42] the first place in in any other way and
[12:45] so in looking here at this woman at the
[12:47] at this Canaanite at this Canaanite
[12:49] woman here on in Matthew chapter 15
[12:51] which you can also read in Mark chapter
[12:53] 7 this this account amen it's always
[12:57] been striking to me this this this this
[12:59] this this this this uh this passage here
[13:02] in the scriptures because uh it's a
[13:05] gentile woman
[13:06] it's not a Hebrew she wasn't uh one of
[13:10] his disciples she uh she wasn't uh
[13:13] someone who was walking with Jesus she
[13:15] was a gentile Heathen woman
[13:18] who apparently where she came from she
[13:20] was a Canaanite woman and where she came
[13:22] from she was uh she she was a idol
[13:26] worshiper she she didn't worship the the
[13:28] the the god of Israel she didn't amen
[13:31] but but somehow or another amen it got
[13:34] to a point that her daughter a man was
[13:37] so sick and was so tormented by a devil
[13:41] that she realized wait a second my God
[13:43] the gods that we are told that we to
[13:45] worship the Bales or the or whoever it
[13:48] is cannot help my daughter
[13:52] and she probably may have heard from
[13:54] many different different testimonies of
[13:57] different people of what Jesus had done
[13:59] for for her for others and and she said
[14:01] you know what if he can do it for them
[14:04] then I know that he can do it for me too
[14:07] amen
[14:08] and I'm not going for myself but I'm
[14:10] going for my daughter amen what mother
[14:13] amen doesn't doesn't do anything amen
[14:15] for their child
[14:17] when she's a true mother
[14:19] I mean she would do she would she would
[14:21] Shake heavens and earth just to be able
[14:23] to find help for a sick a sick daughter
[14:26] or a sick son amen there's nothing that
[14:29] you wouldn't do as a parent for for your
[14:31] child
[14:32] oh they might be 35 years old there's
[14:35] still nothing that you wouldn't do for
[14:36] your child that's your child
[14:39] amen you would try to find help you
[14:41] would try to do whatever you could Amen
[14:43] in order to help your children praise
[14:45] the Lord
[14:46] you know I I is there's there's
[14:49] something that that struck me when I was
[14:51] younger uh I when I used to work at
[14:53] Chick-fil-A in in Greenville South
[14:55] Carolina and there was one evening while
[14:57] parents used to go go pick me up it
[14:59] would be about a 35 minute drive from
[15:02] where we lived to the Chick-fil-A where
[15:03] I was working at and she and they'd pick
[15:06] me up well that evening somehow there
[15:08] was no cell phones at the time so I got
[15:10] so we lost communication I left earlier
[15:13] that that evening and so I I I what I
[15:17] thought that they were going to be
[15:18] already out there waiting for me and and
[15:20] and so what it was at the parking lot
[15:22] the Chick-fil-A was at a parking lot of
[15:24] it was at a mall and so I walked out the
[15:27] parking lot and I was there just walking
[15:29] around I was listening to my music and
[15:31] just kind of walking around and and and
[15:33] my parents were driving around too and
[15:36] they were looking looking for me
[15:37] wondering when I was gonna get out but
[15:39] it was about an hour or so and my mom
[15:41] thought because my mom wasn't with my
[15:43] dad dad even my mom thought that
[15:44] something had happened to me because the
[15:47] Chick-fil-A had already closed so that
[15:49] so the parking lot was getting dark and
[15:52] and uh and so finally I saw them and got
[15:55] in the car and and my mom was worried
[15:57] half to death
[16:00] and that's what we do sometimes as as
[16:02] kids we worry our parents I know I did
[16:07] they pray if it wasn't for their prayers
[16:09] we wouldn't be where we are now
[16:11] amen thank God for our parents prayers
[16:14] but we got home and the love of a mother
[16:16] you know I'll never forget this when we
[16:18] got home
[16:19] we got out of the car and we walked in
[16:22] the house
[16:24] and she opened the door when we walked
[16:26] in together she really wasn't saying
[16:28] anything while we're in the car because
[16:30] she was she was nervous but when we got
[16:33] in the car when we got in the house she
[16:36] turned around looked at me and just gave
[16:38] me this big old tight hug
[16:40] as you started crying on my on my on my
[16:43] shoulders and said I thought I'd lost I
[16:46] thought something was had happened to
[16:47] you
[16:48] and right there I I just I just I I
[16:53] melted to
[16:54] [Laughter]
[16:56] I said Mom I'm okay I was probably like
[16:58] 15 years old
[17:00] Mom I'm okay I'm okay I'm her only son
[17:03] so
[17:04] and her firstborn so
[17:07] but but you know those things leave an
[17:09] impression in your heart
[17:10] it lets you know that your parents you
[17:13] know really love you
[17:14] and uh
[17:15] show them affection when they show you
[17:17] affection
[17:19] because maybe you won't ever have that
[17:20] opportunity again
[17:22] you know you might you might think oh my
[17:24] parent my dad or my mom they're they're
[17:26] just too affectionate I don't want them
[17:28] to go over here and get so close to me
[17:31] but you know what there's you're our
[17:33] children
[17:34] you'll never stop being our children no
[17:37] matter how grown up you might be you're
[17:39] still gonna always be our children
[17:41] and we saw you from a little baby and
[17:43] then here you are you're grown up and
[17:46] you're bigger and
[17:47] we still love you just the same
[17:50] so
[17:51] anyways I don't even know why I got into
[17:54] that that wasn't even in my notes but
[17:56] praise the Lord anyhow
[17:58] amen
[18:00] brother Branham says this here he says
[18:02] in the message in thy seed shall possess
[18:04] the Gate of his enemy he says you go
[18:06] through a test
[18:08] God tests you like he did Abraham he
[18:11] tests Abraham's seed after him and now
[18:14] the reason we don't possess the Gate of
[18:16] the enemy the reason there's so much
[18:18] Among Us is because that we're not able
[18:23] to stand the test
[18:25] and let me tell you something watch what
[18:27] he says here and I thought this was very
[18:28] interesting the test of the word is
[18:30] right
[18:31] amen
[18:32] the test of the word is right you know
[18:37] God Amen when he tests his children amen
[18:40] is through his word
[18:42] amen is how you will respond maybe to
[18:46] Something in the word that maybe he's
[18:48] already spoken to you already but you
[18:50] haven't done anything about it so then
[18:53] he'll bring something about in your life
[18:55] amen there's like you know what you know
[18:58] my word already let's see if you can if
[19:00] you can pass that
[19:02] amen and if you don't pass it you just
[19:04] take it over again until you do pass it
[19:07] amen until you go to the next grade and
[19:10] that's how God works amen so the test of
[19:13] the word is right and so we're going to
[19:16] see here in just a moment how he used
[19:18] his own his word amen in order to to
[19:21] test this this this woman I mean she
[19:24] wasn't a a a daughter of his uh per se
[19:27] but maybe later on she got the Holy
[19:29] Ghost I don't know we don't know after
[19:31] what happened here but one thing is for
[19:33] certain amen we see that something great
[19:36] happened here something something
[19:38] something uh was was brought out of her
[19:41] amen that would not have been brought
[19:43] out any other way and it took a devil
[19:46] Amen to drive her to do that
[19:49] it took a devil amen possessing her her
[19:52] daughter Amen to drop to to put her into
[19:55] that situation in order to bring that
[19:58] situation about and don't you think that
[20:00] God remember Jesus said that he never
[20:03] did anything unless the father showed
[20:05] him first and so we see that here in
[20:07] Matthew chapter 15 amen at the first at
[20:11] the beginning of the chapter the first
[20:12] uh the first part of the chapter he's
[20:15] Jesus is offending left and right
[20:19] he's he's talking about uh the talking
[20:22] about the traditions of uh of God versus
[20:25] the the Commandments of God and how the
[20:27] Pharisees they were just about amen
[20:29] looking good on the outside amen but
[20:31] they were dead men bones inside
[20:35] and how they're dead in their traditions
[20:37] and and he was just offending them left
[20:40] and right
[20:43] and then here he here he comes Amen in
[20:45] this same chapter
[20:47] and is about to bring more offense
[20:50] amen but it's not an offense Amen to do
[20:52] harm
[20:53] but it's an offense to do good
[20:56] amen because he saw I believe that he
[20:59] saw this woman
[21:00] otherwise he wouldn't go to Tire and
[21:02] sidon
[21:03] for one for one I I I I believe that
[21:07] he's trying to get away from the heat
[21:08] there in in in in in Jerusalem or
[21:11] wherever he was talking to the Pharisees
[21:12] it was probably a lot of heat
[21:15] he made him mad
[21:16] so he's probably trying to get away and
[21:18] if you know where tire and siding is
[21:20] located it's located uh on the uh North
[21:24] uh West part of of of of Israel
[21:27] towards the coasts
[21:29] and uh so it's very very far from from
[21:31] from Jerusalem and in those areas and
[21:34] tire inside and are about our cities are
[21:37] about 20 miles away from each other they
[21:39] were Heathen cities they they served
[21:42] other gods and and they they were mostly
[21:45] made up of gentiles
[21:46] amen and there were some Jews there too
[21:48] but
[21:49] Jesus amen went over there to get away
[21:51] from all that heat
[21:54] you know sometimes we need to get away
[21:55] from the Heat
[21:57] it's good to get away you know they were
[22:00] to criticize brother Brandon sometimes
[22:01] while he'd go fishing and shouldn't he
[22:04] always be preaching shouldn't he always
[22:05] be praying for the sick healing to say
[22:08] but you know what you need some rest
[22:09] sometimes
[22:10] you know you a Ministry can wear you out
[22:14] Ministry can wear you out and and
[22:16] preaching can wear you out too
[22:19] and uh so Jesus needed rest along with
[22:23] his disciples
[22:24] now
[22:26] we we know that God has pleased in
[22:28] testing his children we see it we read
[22:30] in First Peter chapter one verse verse 7
[22:32] says that the trial of your faith being
[22:35] much more precious than of gold amen he
[22:38] calls the trial of your faith precious
[22:40] than gold amen that perisheth though it
[22:44] be tried with fire might be found unto
[22:46] praise and honor and Glory at the
[22:48] appearing of Jesus Christ job 23 10
[22:51] tells us yet he knows the way I have
[22:54] taken when he has tested me I will come
[22:57] forth as gold
[22:59] Psalm 66 10 tells us for thou God has
[23:02] proved us thou has tried us as silver is
[23:05] tried amen
[23:08] and then first Peter 4 12 tells us
[23:10] beloved think it not strange concerning
[23:13] the fiery trial which is to try you
[23:17] trials will come
[23:19] tests will come
[23:20] there are unavoidable
[23:23] is how you will react to those tests
[23:25] and how will you react to those trials
[23:28] is is what is is how is what God is
[23:32] trying to
[23:33] bring out of us amen
[23:35] so there in Matthew 15 21 we'll just
[23:37] kind of take it verse 5 verse and it
[23:39] says then Jesus went dancing departed it
[23:41] to the coast of tire and sidon and we we
[23:44] are we read we already went through that
[23:47] Jesus had just amen he had he had a
[23:49] Throwdown I guess you could say with the
[23:51] with the with the Pharisees there at the
[23:53] beginning of the chapter
[23:55] amen but you know what truth is truth
[23:58] amen
[23:59] and and and and and and and and
[24:01] you know Jesus needed Jesus was only
[24:04] here for a certain amount of time
[24:06] so he needed to tell him the truth amen
[24:09] and it was up to them to do what they
[24:11] were going to do with that truth now in
[24:13] verse 22 it says and behold a woman of
[24:16] Canaan came out of the same coast and
[24:18] Cried unto him saying have mercy on me O
[24:21] Lord thou son of David
[24:24] amen it's almost as if she's saying if
[24:27] she's saying that she's the one that
[24:28] needs the help
[24:30] she Cried unto him saying have mercy on
[24:33] me O Lord thou son of David
[24:36] amen obviously she's been around Jews
[24:41] so you know enough to know that the
[24:44] Messiah that was to come was to be the
[24:46] son of David it was a political term
[24:49] that really didn't belong for her to her
[24:51] for for her to say Amen so really she
[24:54] wasn't son of David to him because the
[24:57] son of David was only for the Jews amen
[25:00] and so she she calls out to him and says
[25:03] with with with everything that she has
[25:05] I'm sure she was being she was being
[25:07] genuine in the way she was doing it and
[25:10] she says Lord
[25:11] have mercy on me thou son of David my
[25:16] daughter is grievously vexed with the
[25:18] Devil
[25:19] now the Bible doesn't tell us amen how
[25:22] vexed she was maybe she was it was
[25:24] sickness maybe it was a a demon of of
[25:28] something spiritual in her life we don't
[25:31] know but the Bible tells us that she
[25:33] says to him
[25:35] she was grievously vexed with a devil
[25:40] and you know as I said you know the the
[25:42] the the the her her denomination
[25:45] couldn't help her
[25:46] her church people her pastor couldn't
[25:48] help her amen this was the last
[25:51] opportunity this was the last person
[25:53] amen that she she's she's helped others
[25:56] why couldn't he help me
[25:58] and so she goes with to him as with
[26:01] everything that she has amen
[26:03] praise God now verse 23 tells us but he
[26:06] answered her not a word
[26:10] so here's this woman amen she's making
[26:12] all this F all this racket and all this
[26:14] noise
[26:15] and you know Jesus has to have hurt her
[26:19] but the Bible tells us that he answered
[26:22] her not a word
[26:24] amen
[26:25] maybe Jesus and the disciples amen they
[26:28] were really they were really relaxing
[26:31] they were really you know we've had
[26:33] we've had we've had enough uh heat for
[26:37] for a little while and and and maybe
[26:39] Jesus was on his phone
[26:42] you know
[26:43] like some of us sometimes you know hey
[26:46] brother how you doing huh
[26:49] [Laughter]
[26:51] you're taught you have to talk over
[26:53] people now amen you gotta snatch the
[26:55] phone off off of people just to get them
[26:57] to pay attention to you nowadays
[27:00] I've I've been there done that I got the
[27:02] T-shirt
[27:03] my wife could tell you that that's the
[27:06] case
[27:10] but here
[27:12] it's rude when somebody doesn't pay
[27:14] attention to you or doesn't doesn't hear
[27:16] you out
[27:17] right and here's this woman amen when it
[27:20] comes to Jesus with a need
[27:23] and the Bible says that he then answer
[27:27] her not one word
[27:30] I mean we get offended nowadays amen
[27:32] when people when you know that they read
[27:34] our text message because it says red at
[27:36] the bottom and they don't reply back
[27:39] you imagine that
[27:41] the god of creation
[27:44] amen the the Jesus amen who whose the
[27:48] loving Christ Jesus who's supposed to
[27:50] pay attention to to every one of our
[27:53] needs
[27:55] didn't reply back to her
[27:59] didn't reply her text message
[28:01] in other words
[28:03] in today's
[28:05] vernacular
[28:09] can you imagine that
[28:11] and his disciples came and besought him
[28:14] saying verse 23 and his disciples came
[28:16] and besought him saying send her away
[28:19] for she crieth after us now
[28:23] and looking at some and reading at some
[28:25] of this
[28:27] we don't know there's there's we don't
[28:29] know if the disciples were telling her
[28:32] go ahead and give her what she wants
[28:35] and let her just go on her way
[28:38] telling Jesus
[28:40] or Jesus go ahead and just tell her to
[28:43] go away
[28:44] right because they knew that Jesus could
[28:47] do what could give her what she needed
[28:50] but obviously she was being very
[28:53] bothersome to them
[28:55] and so much that amen they were probably
[28:58] on their phones too I don't know
[29:00] I mean they were probably they were
[29:01] probably they were probably just just
[29:03] busy and and and and like you know what
[29:07] get her to go away
[29:09] do something Jesus in other words they
[29:11] were trying to tell Jesus what to do
[29:14] amen
[29:16] and Jesus was just there minding his own
[29:18] business amen
[29:21] so here's the thing the woman that woman
[29:24] was re was ignored first
[29:27] she comes with a need
[29:29] and how is it you know when we when we
[29:32] come with a need amen and and
[29:34] we're and we're ignored amen she comes
[29:38] with a need and is ignored by not just
[29:40] Jesus but by the church as well
[29:44] the disciples ignore her as well
[29:46] they don't even give her any help
[29:49] amen and so now amen she feels rejected
[29:53] as well
[29:55] praise the Lord
[29:57] send her away for she crieth after us
[29:59] and it wasn't that they were she was
[30:01] crying for them because she wasn't
[30:02] saying she wasn't telling that Peter
[30:05] have mercy on me or anything like that
[30:06] no she was one in Jesus
[30:09] but they were getting in the way of her
[30:11] getting to Jesus
[30:13] I wonder if sometimes us amen as the
[30:17] Disciples of Christ as the Church of
[30:19] Christ if we don't get in the way of
[30:22] people
[30:23] getting closer to God
[30:26] amen
[30:27] maybe we're the ones that fault amen for
[30:31] people not drawing closer to us
[30:34] because we think amen that
[30:36] our way the way we do it is is how we it
[30:41] needs to be done
[30:42] and you know what sometimes that might
[30:45] just turn people more away
[30:48] then draw them closer
[30:51] it's better amen to just just say Lord
[30:53] have your way
[30:55] Lord do what you need to do amen and you
[30:58] know the hearts of people
[31:00] because you and me cannot do the work
[31:02] for others I can't change Hearts but the
[31:05] weight can't change Hearts brother said
[31:06] brother Dell can't change Hearts none of
[31:08] us can change people's hearts only God
[31:11] changes hearts hey man
[31:14] only God a man can change the heart
[31:17] there is nothing that you and I can say
[31:20] Amen to some rebellious rebellious youth
[31:23] or some rebellious person or or anybody
[31:26] amen that would change their heart
[31:27] unless God comes down and does it
[31:29] himself
[31:31] hey man I'm just thoroughly convinced of
[31:33] that more and more
[31:36] as the year passes by and as you see our
[31:38] our children growing amen there is
[31:41] nothing that you and I can say Amen that
[31:44] really will turn hearts
[31:47] unless they really want to desire it
[31:50] first
[31:52] other than that amen it's just just you
[31:56] just wasting your breath it really God
[31:59] has not gone in there now you can be
[32:02] salty
[32:03] you'd be salted before people because I
[32:05] promise you that living the life amen
[32:08] and and and living before others amen
[32:11] has more impact than anything that you
[32:13] and I could say
[32:15] amen
[32:16] anything that you and me could say
[32:19] amen any anything that you and me can
[32:22] can prove to someone
[32:24] amen
[32:26] doesn't have as much impact as when
[32:28] somebody amen sees a life a genuine uh
[32:31] life amen being reflected out of out of
[32:34] you I pray God helped us amen
[32:38] pray God helps us
[32:41] so the disciples amen they take the
[32:43] matters into their own hands and and
[32:45] they try to tell Jesus what to do
[32:48] and and and so what what was what was
[32:52] the real reason that the disciples
[32:53] wanted Jesus to send her away was it
[32:55] because they wanted her to be healed
[32:58] or was it because they were she was
[33:00] being just a bother like a little like a
[33:02] little puppy a little dog a little
[33:04] barking Chihuahua
[33:06] hey man just barking right around here I
[33:08] don't know if you ever had a barking
[33:10] Chihuahua maybe you have one of those at
[33:12] your house
[33:13] we used to have a Chihuahua when we were
[33:16] younger
[33:17] and then things oh man they they're
[33:19] bothersome yeah
[33:21] yeah they're cute some of them
[33:24] but then they they have that that that
[33:26] bothersome bark
[33:28] it gets on your nerves and so much that
[33:30] you just want to stick them in a closet
[33:32] and shut the door and just not let them
[33:34] ever come out again
[33:37] but they'll keep they'll watch over a
[33:40] house though
[33:41] they'll let you know if somebody's
[33:43] approaching the house
[33:45] amen but that's how these these
[33:48] disciples saw that this woman
[33:50] and verse 24 it says
[33:52] but he answered and said I am not sent
[33:56] but unto the lost sheep of the House of
[33:58] Israel now this is after Jesus after the
[34:01] disciples had told them
[34:03] send her away and this is his reply
[34:06] Jesus replied but he answered and said I
[34:08] am not sent but unto the lost sheep of
[34:12] the House of Israel so was Jesus
[34:15] answering the disciples or was he saying
[34:17] it to the woman
[34:20] because he doesn't it doesn't say
[34:21] whether he was talking to the woman or
[34:24] was he answering his disciples you see
[34:26] now later on we'll know we'll see that
[34:29] he actually directly talks to the woman
[34:32] amen but I believe that Jesus when he
[34:35] was saying this amen he was saying that
[34:36] with with with tenderness and compassion
[34:40] amen
[34:41] but yet stating truth
[34:43] amen
[34:44] because let's just read it like this
[34:46] sometimes we want to read this these
[34:49] passages and and and think that Jesus
[34:51] was just being so hard and and and and
[34:53] and just kind of just kind of you know
[34:56] going over this woman you are a dog and
[34:59] but I don't think Jesus because Jesus
[35:01] because the woman was was still
[35:04] persistent
[35:06] and you're not going to persist amen
[35:08] with someone who who doesn't want you
[35:12] you know you just kind of leave him
[35:13] alone then
[35:15] but I believe that that that the way
[35:17] Jesus was talking amen wasn't being
[35:21] harsh wasn't being wasn't being a uh
[35:25] critical hey man wasn't being amen but I
[35:27] believe Jesus amen let's just see it
[35:29] like this he said I am not sent but unto
[35:33] the lost sheep of the House of Israel
[35:36] in other words
[35:37] I'm I'm I got I got to do this
[35:41] you know
[35:44] it's almost like I'm being torn apart
[35:46] you know
[35:49] this is just me I could be wrong
[35:52] but
[35:54] the loving Jesus amen
[35:58] had to find a certain way Amen to bring
[36:00] that out of her
[36:02] amen
[36:04] praise God
[36:06] and it caused amen it caused the woman
[36:08] to be persistent
[36:10] amen however it was that the Lord Jesus
[36:12] amen was answering her it caused her to
[36:15] be persistent amen because she kept
[36:17] persisting praise God and so we see here
[36:20] amen that brother Branham the quote that
[36:22] we just read that he says the test of
[36:24] the word is Right amen praise God what
[36:28] Jesus was doing amen was the right thing
[36:31] what Jesus was saying to her was the
[36:34] right thing because the Bible says that
[36:35] he came to his own
[36:37] right and his own received him not he
[36:40] came as the Messiah for the Jews
[36:42] amen he was fulfilling amen the Old
[36:45] Testament scriptures amen and so he
[36:47] really wasn't for them but
[36:50] was it that the Gentiles were not going
[36:53] to receive any benefits while he was
[36:55] there
[36:56] Sunday
[36:59] and and if you look back amen he replies
[37:02] this way but if you go back to Matthew
[37:04] chapter eight just a few chapters before
[37:06] we see the Roman Centurion
[37:10] and he was a gentile
[37:13] and he goes to Jesus almost in the same
[37:15] way and he says Lord uh he says uh uh uh
[37:20] my my servant is grievously sick and you
[37:24] know what Jesus replies to him he says
[37:27] I'll go and heal him
[37:30] why didn't he answer her this way
[37:34] but then what what the Centurion says he
[37:37] says uh Lord I'm not worthy that you
[37:39] come under my roof
[37:42] amen because you're you're you're you're
[37:44] you're a master just like I am and if
[37:46] you and and I tell this one to do this
[37:48] and this one to go that and but if you
[37:50] just say the word
[37:53] it was almost it's almost as if Jesus
[37:56] amen said deliberately those things or
[38:00] did deliberately those things in order
[38:02] to bring that out of them
[38:04] the Roman Centurion
[38:06] and it's the same thing with the
[38:08] Canaanite woman here that we're reading
[38:10] about
[38:11] makes me think about predestination
[38:13] brother Ryan talking about bro this the
[38:16] uh Sunday it really enjoyed that that
[38:19] that uh Sunday school lesson
[38:22] about how God has a plan for us and it's
[38:25] like a it's like a play in the different
[38:27] characters and and all this and and
[38:30] God's foreknowledge amen he knows amen
[38:33] what you are going to choose amen
[38:36] praise God so he'll present the
[38:39] situation
[38:41] in order for you to make the decision to
[38:44] make the choice now maybe the Centurion
[38:46] he heard the same thing too he probably
[38:49] heard that others were being healed as
[38:51] well so why couldn't his servant be
[38:53] healed amen and maybe he see they had to
[38:56] hear something first
[38:58] in order for them to make a decision to
[39:01] go to Jesus
[39:02] and then Jesus present things Amen to
[39:05] them the way they're the the way they
[39:07] did so Jesus to the Romans and church
[39:09] says I'll go and heal him
[39:11] oh no no Lord no you stay right there
[39:15] you just say the word
[39:18] amen and my servant will be healed
[39:24] that was powerful
[39:26] Jesus told him he said amen I haven't
[39:28] seen such faith in Israel
[39:31] amen
[39:33] and his servant was healed
[39:36] why is
[39:38] why it say do the same thing for this
[39:40] woman she was a gentile just like he was
[39:43] he was she was a heathen just like the
[39:46] Roman Centurion was
[39:48] nothing different other than he was a
[39:50] man and she this is a woman
[39:54] but you see God knows exactly how to
[39:56] deal with each and every one of us
[39:59] he knows exactly what you need or what
[40:02] he needs to say Amen through his word or
[40:05] maybe through a sermon or or maybe
[40:07] somebody says something to you to bring
[40:09] a certain reaction amen that will spark
[40:12] amen for you too too to to decide going
[40:16] this way or decide going that way Amen
[40:18] in order to fulfill your predestination
[40:22] amen that's how I believe it
[40:25] I believe that that's what happened here
[40:29] because God's not respect your persons
[40:31] he just knows exactly what you need
[40:33] you see praise God sometimes hey man
[40:36] we're so stuck in in and it needs to be
[40:39] done this way this way God only does it
[40:41] this way God
[40:43] you'll be surprised
[40:45] God sometimes amen does things totally
[40:48] different than what we think
[40:50] and you can't say that that is not of
[40:53] God
[40:54] if it's going to bring out a positive
[40:56] outcome amen then so be it he'll always
[41:00] stay in his word for sure
[41:02] and neither of these two situations he
[41:04] was out of the word
[41:06] he just knows the hearts of the people
[41:08] much better than you and me do
[41:11] you don't know people's hearts
[41:13] I don't know people's hearts
[41:15] therefore we can't judge amen and say
[41:19] yes yes yes yes yes when in reality you
[41:21] don't know
[41:23] amen so we got to be careful with that
[41:27] we got to be careful with that
[41:30] amen so in John 1 11 says he came to his
[41:32] own and his own received him not amen so
[41:36] Jesus was there fulfilling amen that
[41:38] that that that scripture amen
[41:43] and and then going back to what brother
[41:45] Ryan was saying amen because
[41:49] um
[41:49] I like the way he brought it out with
[41:52] regards to to you know uh the different
[41:54] characters and a play and and all those
[41:57] different things different elements have
[41:59] to take place in our life amen we in our
[42:01] life this woman right here amen God
[42:04] Jesus was trying to do everything he
[42:07] could because he only had a certain
[42:09] amount of time with her
[42:10] so
[42:12] he did everything amen that he could
[42:15] Amen to draw out what he knew was in her
[42:18] amen
[42:20] all in maybe in a 30-minute span
[42:23] what might take place for us in 80 years
[42:27] the ups and downs where we don't where
[42:29] we where we pray to God and say Lord do
[42:32] this for me and God doesn't answer and
[42:34] then sometimes we have our our our our
[42:35] ups and and we have their good times and
[42:38] and all that that woman experienced that
[42:40] in within a span of maybe 30 minutes
[42:43] God wasn't going to waste Jesus wasn't
[42:45] there waste any time amen he was going
[42:47] to bring out from her amen exactly what
[42:50] she he needed to bring out
[42:53] so it could take for us 75 years to do
[42:55] it it could take fit amen God is patient
[42:58] but for in this situation he needed to
[43:01] do it within 20 to 30 minutes
[43:05] that's the reason why he because you
[43:07] read this passage and you think how
[43:08] harsh Jesus was
[43:12] what situation why couldn't he just go
[43:14] and and just heal his daughter or or
[43:16] remotely do it
[43:18] he did it for the Roman Centurion why
[43:21] can't amen but he was he was the pro the
[43:25] healing part was not the his problem
[43:27] he could do that that is not a problem
[43:31] he was trying to bring out out of this
[43:32] woman amen something that he knew that
[43:35] he that she could come to
[43:38] him he was more concerned about her than
[43:40] he was about the healing
[43:42] of the daughter
[43:44] amen
[43:45] that's how strange God does things
[43:48] he's more concerned about the heart
[43:51] than he is about amen the healing of a
[43:54] person
[43:55] I'm not saying that that that that the
[43:58] healing is not important to him I'm just
[44:00] saying
[44:01] the heart is more important amen
[44:04] because you could be healed in your body
[44:06] and then
[44:07] maybe backslide a year from now
[44:10] and be totally healed from cancer
[44:13] God will never take that away
[44:15] he could
[44:17] amen
[44:18] he could but
[44:21] he's more concerned about your heart
[44:22] condition
[44:24] about your soul
[44:26] praise the Lord
[44:28] so healing of our bodies amen that's
[44:30] just that's just
[44:32] that's just a little bit sometimes it's
[44:34] the hearts that he has he has to work on
[44:36] more amen but he does it right
[44:39] that's exactly what he needs to do amen
[44:43] so in verse 25 it tells us then came she
[44:46] and worshiped him saying Lord help me
[44:50] amen and and after being rejected after
[44:54] being ignored she finally said you know
[44:57] what he's not my Messiah he's not he's
[45:00] not I'm he's not by son of David I
[45:03] realized that but at least I'm going to
[45:05] plead for his mercy and for his grace
[45:07] that's all I got amen
[45:11] praise the Lord Jesus silence amen
[45:13] towards her and and what seemed to be a
[45:16] rejection brought out
[45:18] authenticity from her
[45:21] now she was now she she came in talking
[45:24] about son of David have mercy on me she
[45:27] wouldn't be an authentic then
[45:29] she was just doing what what others were
[45:31] doing
[45:32] she was just saying what others was
[45:33] saying
[45:34] now she said Lord
[45:37] I have no other place to go I have no
[45:40] other person to turn to Lord
[45:44] help me
[45:46] brought out something authentic from her
[45:49] brought out humility out of her
[45:52] amen brought up perseverance in her
[45:55] amen amen in a Heart of Worship too
[45:58] now she's got a Heart of Worship
[46:01] praise the Lord
[46:05] amen
[46:07] and Matthew
[46:10] Matthew and the next verse he says but
[46:13] he answered and said
[46:15] it is not me to take the children's
[46:17] bread and to cast it to dogs
[46:22] amen now let's just look at this here
[46:24] for just a moment I'm just kind of
[46:26] skipping here a few things
[46:28] because what Jesus was doing amen he was
[46:30] setting her up
[46:32] remember the title is when God sets you
[46:34] up he was setting her up the whole time
[46:36] amen he was setting her up for for a
[46:39] breakthrough praise God that's really
[46:41] what he was doing
[46:43] amen and sometimes our in our problems
[46:45] amen God is all he's doing is just
[46:47] setting you up
[46:50] he's just setting you up
[46:53] he answered and said it is not meat to
[46:55] take the children's bread and to cast it
[46:57] to dogs now
[46:58] according to Mark 7 24 which is the
[47:01] other scripture that's talking about the
[47:04] same situation
[47:05] Jesus at this time was in a house
[47:10] and it reads like this and from thence
[47:12] he arose and went into the borders of
[47:14] tire and sidon and entered into an house
[47:17] and would not and would and would have
[47:20] no man know it but he could not be hid
[47:23] so the woman probably entered into the
[47:26] house maybe she was outside crying for
[47:29] him
[47:30] and the disciples said tell her to go
[47:32] away at this time now he's entering into
[47:35] an house maybe he was there to pray for
[47:37] somebody or or to heal somebody or maybe
[47:40] just to have dinner we don't know why he
[47:42] was there at the house for but she won't
[47:44] leave him alone
[47:48] and then in verse 27 because we know
[47:51] that Jesus actually uh says this line to
[47:54] her but Jesus said unto her amen that
[47:57] same line that we just read there in
[47:58] verse 26. let their children first be
[48:02] filled
[48:04] for it is not me to take the children's
[48:06] bread and to cast it unto the dogs
[48:10] now if you look at the Greek word
[48:12] because sometimes we wonder what's Jesus
[48:15] really calling her a dog
[48:19] maybe maybe not
[48:21] but if you look at the Greek there amen
[48:24] Jesus the the is the word the Greek word
[48:27] there is
[48:31] and that and that word means a little
[48:34] dog
[48:35] a house dog
[48:38] or a puppy
[48:42] it's totally different from the word
[48:44] dogs that are used in Matthew chapter 7
[48:46] verse 6.
[48:48] which is which says give not that which
[48:50] is holy unto the dogs that's a totally
[48:52] different word there is the word kissing
[48:55] it's the Greek word kisim which is a dog
[48:58] which is universally despised in the
[49:01] East a primary word or a dog
[49:04] in Luke 16 21 speaking of Lazarus the
[49:07] beggar having his Source licked by dogs
[49:09] that is a totally different word there
[49:11] as well which means which means the same
[49:14] thing as the previous one a dog
[49:16] universally despised in the East or a
[49:19] dog but the word that Jesus uses there
[49:21] or the translation is a puppy or a house
[49:24] dog
[49:26] so he wasn't calling her a dog from the
[49:29] street
[49:31] a dog from the street doesn't have any
[49:35] uh uh uh uh benefits
[49:39] but your dog at your house you will he
[49:42] has benefits he might be a dog but he's
[49:45] got benefits
[49:47] or she's got benefits
[49:50] he wasn't calling her a dog as an
[49:52] offense per se
[49:54] and while he was really telling her is
[49:56] like hold on a second let me take care
[50:00] of the children first
[50:03] then you can be taken care of
[50:06] and we'll read here that in just a
[50:07] moment amen because Jesus really wasn't
[50:10] refusing her request
[50:12] is not what he was doing he was just
[50:15] prioritizing her request
[50:17] is really what he was doing
[50:20] so we have this dog at our house her
[50:22] name is Satsuki
[50:24] and I have a picture here man you want
[50:27] to see a picture of our dog
[50:33] maybe the brothers could bring can bring
[50:35] that up
[50:42] anyways I need to connect here anyways
[50:46] that Satsuki right there
[50:49] that was a picture that my wife took
[50:51] last night
[50:53] and she's a Maltipoo
[50:55] now
[50:57] this is the position that she's always
[50:59] at when I get home
[51:01] from work
[51:03] especially when she sees me going
[51:05] through
[51:06] she knows that I'm going to be giving
[51:07] her some something to eat
[51:11] she's looking at me just like that
[51:13] and jumping and then eventually she'll
[51:15] start jumping and stuff like that
[51:19] but
[51:21] what Jesus is telling this woman
[51:24] is that
[51:26] you you maybe you're a house dog right
[51:31] but a house dog with benefits
[51:34] because as the people are eating
[51:36] and stuff like that maybe I I don't know
[51:38] I'll do it I'm not supposed to my wife
[51:40] gets on to me to do it
[51:42] as I'm eating amen sometimes I'll give
[51:46] her a little something
[51:49] or or or or as maybe the the the the the
[51:52] kids at the house sometimes if they if
[51:55] they're like finish your food and
[51:57] they don't finish it all so that
[51:59] eventually gets gone
[52:01] wow
[52:03] they had given her the last few scraps
[52:07] she is eating exactly what we're eating
[52:11] at the time that we're eating
[52:14] so what this woman is is
[52:16] about to tell her the brothers can cut
[52:18] that off for just a moment
[52:21] bring my notes back here
[52:26] what Jesus is trying to tell them is is
[52:28] tell her is hold on a second amen
[52:31] the children come first
[52:33] then you can then you can have your
[52:35] benefits amen
[52:37] I'm not ignoring you
[52:39] amen he clearly tells her I'm not
[52:41] ignoring you you you but they come first
[52:44] amen
[52:45] it's almost like the the the equivalent
[52:48] of like uh you know when you go to the
[52:50] to the let's say you you broke your
[52:52] ankle or or or you sprung your ankle and
[52:55] you go to the emergency room
[52:57] amen and then you're there at the
[52:59] emergency room but as you're they're
[53:01] being treated and they're looking at
[53:03] your ankle and then but then here comes
[53:05] a man a man who's been shot or gunshot
[53:08] wounded
[53:09] and it's bleeding all over the place
[53:11] inside the same inside the same uh uh
[53:14] emergency room and and everybody amen
[53:17] stops doing what they're doing to you
[53:19] amen because they got to attend to this
[53:21] man
[53:22] yeah
[53:23] you ain't gonna get mad
[53:25] you ain't going you ain't gonna be like
[53:27] well I ain't coming here anymore and you
[53:29] just hobble out right out of the
[53:30] hospital
[53:31] they gonna take care of them
[53:35] he's bleeding blood coming out of his
[53:37] mouth and all kinds of stuff and you're
[53:39] worried about a sprung that's exactly
[53:41] what Jesus is doing with this woman
[53:43] hold on a second wage return
[53:46] amen
[53:48] but the woman wasn't gonna have it
[53:52] she understood amen
[53:55] she understood because I mean she could
[53:57] have left mad right there she could have
[53:59] left sad she could have left right there
[54:01] in the day but you're not gonna help me
[54:02] well I'm gone
[54:04] and I will make sure that I post it all
[54:06] over Facebook and let everybody know who
[54:08] you really are Jesus
[54:10] and Peter
[54:12] and and and and all the disciples I'll
[54:14] tell them who you really are you really
[54:16] don't want to help you're you're racist
[54:22] I'm pulling out the race card
[54:24] like everybody else does nowadays all
[54:26] right let me get off that
[54:29] but this is this is she could have done
[54:31] it
[54:33] but she didn't
[54:37] he called me a house dog
[54:40] he called me a dog
[54:43] but you know what she she started
[54:45] thinking with herself amen she probably
[54:47] started thinking wait a second he called
[54:50] me a house dog
[54:53] and he called me a dog
[54:55] he called me a house dog
[54:58] and being that I have a house dog I have
[54:59] a dog in my house myself
[55:03] I can enjoy what the master is eating
[55:07] maybe she thought that within herself at
[55:09] the moment and she says in verse 27 she
[55:12] says
[55:12] truth Lord
[55:14] yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
[55:18] fall from their master's table
[55:21] in other words as the master is eating
[55:24] the dogs can also enjoy at the same time
[55:28] so what she's trying to tell him is Lord
[55:30] as you're there dealing with with your
[55:32] children
[55:34] I can enjoy those benefits too
[55:37] at the same time
[55:40] amen
[55:41] well look what look in in Mark 7 28 says
[55:45] it says it like this and she answered
[55:46] and said unto him yes Lord
[55:49] yet the dogs under the table eat of the
[55:53] children's crumbs
[55:55] and when you look at that word crumbs it
[55:57] could also mean morsels
[55:59] amen so whatever the the the the the
[56:01] master is eating whatever their children
[56:04] are eating I can enjoy too even if it's
[56:06] in small portions but it's the same food
[56:10] amen it's the same food praise the Lord
[56:14] Jesus
[56:15] amen
[56:16] and she agreed with Jesus
[56:18] she told them you're right Lord
[56:21] you're right amen she said the right
[56:24] thing
[56:25] you are right Lord
[56:28] but yet even though I may be a dog maybe
[56:32] a house dog or whatever it is that
[56:35] you're calling me amen but I can have
[56:37] the same benefits that they are having
[56:40] praise God
[56:42] amen don't you think that you can enjoy
[56:44] the same benefits well somebody else got
[56:46] healed somebody else family a child came
[56:49] to the came to the Lord somebody else
[56:51] amen received this benefit in their life
[56:54] spiritual life I don't know about me
[56:56] amen but if you just take the attitude
[56:58] of this woman amen that amen they can
[57:01] have it I can too because God is not a
[57:04] respecter of persons amen praise the
[57:07] Lord the way they came amen is the way
[57:09] that I can come
[57:10] praise God her faith was already built
[57:12] so much amen even through rejection
[57:15] through through being ignored even
[57:17] through all these different things amen
[57:19] even being insulted almost
[57:24] and yet all that did was just raise her
[57:27] faith up
[57:29] even more
[57:33] praise God
[57:34] that's hard
[57:37] but I believe that if Jesus amen it
[57:41] maybe if Jesus was was being harsh
[57:45] towards her
[57:46] like we think maybe he was
[57:49] maybe she might not have replied that
[57:52] way
[57:53] because who who will
[57:56] who will come to you we'll draw closer
[57:59] to you when you're harsh to them
[58:02] it doesn't work that way
[58:05] but I believe in assault in in a softer
[58:08] way wait a second
[58:10] let me take care of that then the dog
[58:12] because maybe Jesus was telling her that
[58:14] in the in a way of like let's say let's
[58:16] say we say uh uh
[58:18] you know the Golden Rule you know some
[58:21] sort of quote you know uh you know treat
[58:24] others as you want to be treated
[58:26] right maybe he's just kind of telling
[58:28] her that it's not it's not right for me
[58:31] to to to to to
[58:34] deal with you right now when there's a
[58:36] need here
[58:38] but I will deal with you
[58:41] oh it's okay Lord
[58:42] but even while you're dealing with them
[58:45] I'll have my portion as well
[58:48] praise God because hiding trouble I
[58:50] didn't come all over here all this way
[58:52] amen just to not just to leave
[58:53] empty-handed amen I could receive a
[58:57] blessing too right man I didn't I didn't
[58:59] I didn't walk all this way I didn't go
[59:01] through all this I didn't go through
[59:02] every church and every preacher from our
[59:05] church to pray for my daughter and I
[59:07] went through many doctors maybe she went
[59:09] through a whole lot of stuff just to get
[59:11] the healing for her daughter and you're
[59:13] my last chance Lord
[59:15] you're my last resort
[59:18] and I know that you are right Lord
[59:20] but even
[59:22] in this condition amen
[59:25] I can receive benefits praise God
[59:30] amen
[59:33] look what brother Branham says in the
[59:34] message perseverance now this woman the
[59:36] seraphenician woman she believed also
[59:39] this Greek she said Lord first she said
[59:41] thou son of David a gentile has no hold
[59:43] on Christ by the son of David that was
[59:46] thought King that was through King David
[59:49] the race of the Jews he never paid any
[59:51] attention to her but when she turned and
[59:53] said Lord help me amen that got him
[59:58] he was her Lord not a son of David
[1:00:01] but he was her Lord Lord help me
[1:00:03] that caught him and he turned around and
[1:00:06] said it's true the dogs eat the scraps
[1:00:08] from the master's table that is true
[1:00:11] look what that woman had the right
[1:00:13] approach to God's gift
[1:00:15] what did she say
[1:00:17] he said he said she approached it right
[1:00:21] amen
[1:00:22] she approached it right
[1:00:24] I like the way Jesus says it in in I
[1:00:28] believe it's in the Living Translation
[1:00:30] in verse 28 she said she replied that's
[1:00:34] true Lord but even the dogs under the
[1:00:37] table are allowed to eat the scraps from
[1:00:39] the children's plates
[1:00:41] and then and then what in verse 29 he
[1:00:44] says good answer he said
[1:00:48] good answer
[1:00:49] now go home for the demon has left your
[1:00:52] daughter
[1:00:54] amen he finally tells her what she
[1:00:57] wanted to hear the whole time after she
[1:01:00] after he got from her what he wanted out
[1:01:02] of her
[1:01:03] amen amen praise the Lord maybe you're
[1:01:06] you're seeking the the Healer in your
[1:01:08] life for what for for your healing I
[1:01:10] don't know
[1:01:11] but really what you need maybe you're
[1:01:13] seeking the healing in in your life but
[1:01:15] what you really need is the Healer yeah
[1:01:18] amen
[1:01:19] maybe what you're you're seeking a
[1:01:21] miracle in your life but what you really
[1:01:23] need is the miracle maker amen maybe
[1:01:27] what what you need is is him personally
[1:01:29] amen and and not necessarily the the the
[1:01:32] benefit of him and when the woman got to
[1:01:35] that point that she was seeking the the
[1:01:38] the him more than the benefit
[1:01:42] then Jesus could do something for her
[1:01:45] brother he didn't even he wasn't even
[1:01:47] seeing her daughter she probably he
[1:01:49] probably didn't even know what he she
[1:01:50] looked like
[1:01:51] he probably had never seen her before
[1:01:53] maybe in his mind he did the Bible
[1:01:55] doesn't say but he had never even talked
[1:01:58] to her and yet
[1:02:00] when he received that response and that
[1:02:02] faith and that that that that that
[1:02:04] increased in her amen
[1:02:07] go your daughter is made well
[1:02:11] praise God
[1:02:12] amen good answer
[1:02:15] amen praise the Lord
[1:02:19] amen
[1:02:20] so she so she received amen exactly what
[1:02:23] she needed to hear that the brothers
[1:02:24] could could bring uh the the screen up
[1:02:27] one more time
[1:02:30] hmm
[1:02:36] I hope this plays
[1:02:38] all right there we go so
[1:02:42] right there she was ignored
[1:02:45] right
[1:02:47] she still kept going
[1:02:50] then she she was rejected
[1:02:53] right
[1:02:54] she still kept going
[1:02:57] all right come on bro
[1:02:59] send her away
[1:03:00] not even paying attention
[1:03:06] then she was considered insignificant
[1:03:12] but she's still climbing
[1:03:16] then
[1:03:19] she was insulted
[1:03:23] but if you notice a man that as as as
[1:03:26] all these roadblocks are being
[1:03:29] put in front of her amen that all it is
[1:03:31] is just scaling her up for
[1:03:34] for her they're just stepping stones
[1:03:37] for for her miracle
[1:03:40] amen
[1:03:42] there's the miracle and there's the
[1:03:44] blessing right there and Jesus was was
[1:03:47] setting her up the whole time
[1:03:49] praise the Lord
[1:03:54] so you're you're you're you're you're
[1:03:55] your nose amen the nose are the best
[1:03:59] yeses that that God will that you'll
[1:04:02] ever receive amen
[1:04:04] amen sometimes we ask the Lord God do
[1:04:06] this amen and he says no
[1:04:09] and I know that that was kind of a
[1:04:10] little cheesy but I was I was actually
[1:04:13] working with a little program that
[1:04:16] you know you know what let me let me try
[1:04:19] this and it worked
[1:04:20] [Laughter]
[1:04:24] praise God
[1:04:27] so God is setting you up I mean it could
[1:04:29] maybe for this woman it was a it was an
[1:04:32] ordeal about maybe 15 to 30 minutes I
[1:04:34] don't know we don't know how long that
[1:04:36] that that whole ordeal took place
[1:04:38] for you it could be five years
[1:04:41] for you could be 10 years 15 years 30
[1:04:43] years
[1:04:44] I don't know you don't know but God
[1:04:47] ultimately wants hearts
[1:04:50] not just the Miracles
[1:04:53] the Miracles are fine
[1:04:55] but he ultimately wants hearts
[1:04:57] maybe maybe he's doing the things he's
[1:05:00] doing in your life because he wants your
[1:05:02] heart
[1:05:03] he wants your heart first
[1:05:06] he wants to do a work in you first
[1:05:09] then after he's done with you
[1:05:13] then he can do the rest
[1:05:16] because that part is easy
[1:05:18] amen amen
[1:05:19] amen so I just thank God Amen for for
[1:05:22] that praise the Lord Jesus
[1:05:24] amen right before we leave I wanted to
[1:05:27] if the brothers made sure make sure that

[1:06:42] thank you to each one of us as to
[1:06:44] brother Dale specifically
[1:06:47] so

[1:07:29] and just keep them in your prayers amen
[1:07:31] there was a few other things he'd
[1:07:33] mentioned there and I just
[1:07:35] can't interpret it if I don't hear it
[1:07:42] so anyways
[1:07:45] all right
[1:07:46] also one more thing uh we were asking
[1:07:49] that that we pray for for brother Eric
[1:07:52] godjo's little baby on Sunday
[1:07:54] and this is this is the little one but
[1:07:58] the
[1:07:58] today and I I need to check with him
[1:08:02] um
[1:08:02] but he has a he has a problem with his
[1:08:04] ears
[1:08:06] apparently apparently uh
[1:08:10] he sent more pictures okay
[1:08:13] um his ear his ear hole was uh just like
[1:08:17] it's kind of closed so
[1:08:21] um
[1:08:22] this is his other side so both of them
[1:08:25] and he has a little growth growing out
[1:08:27] of his ear so he asked that you all just
[1:08:29] keep keep him in your prayers he was
[1:08:30] supposed to go to the doctor today and
[1:08:32] they were going to tell him give him
[1:08:34] direction as to how
[1:08:36] what they should do
[1:08:38] so just remember brother Eric in your
[1:08:40] prayers in the little and the little
[1:08:42] baby that God would just give him
[1:08:44] Direction
