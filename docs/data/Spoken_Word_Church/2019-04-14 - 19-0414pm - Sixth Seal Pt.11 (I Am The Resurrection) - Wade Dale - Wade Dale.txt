chapter 6 let's talk a little bit about the sixth seal maybe bring it to a close with one more thought and today we want to speak on I am the resurrection being next week will be the time that we celebrate the resurrection you know that we were talking a few weeks ago then most people can't get him off the cross well a lot of them can't get him out of the grave either I mean they just can't get him into their life so we pray that that if this message has shown us nothing else is even that's six seals showing us that it's costing you the hope of glory he decided that this is the way it's going to be and this is the way it is and we must conform to his how can the Potter say to the clay you should have done it a different way you can't do that the Potter it has all full control but you know end that the in that the Potter has full control he knows what the pots gonna look like and man this one does this Potter knows exactly what he's looking for and he found it in the bride of Jesus Christ in the end time so let's bow our heads before we get started truth remember brother day actually remember also sister gal she's going through through to a lot with him they've been companions down 60 something years so she's I'm sure right there with him so we want to pray for her strength too let's bow our heads the only father would thank you today this you give us an opportunity to stand one more day in the purchase of your blood Lord to be here among a group of people that loves your father that wants to hear more from you Lord that that begs for revelation more than anything Lord there is father we pray that you would grant that now as being the active participant in the service you're the only one that can do the revealing you're the only one that can do the speaking father so I pray that you do that today Lord beaver brothers date Lord touch him if all goes where the doctors have to go in that Lord you will guide the doctors hands and that you'll be right there with him Lord be with sister Gail also give her supernatural strength to handle any situation Lord that she'll be a solid rock for all of us to look on as our example of being a wonderful wonderful wife we pray Lord that you just be with each one of us take care of us be with us in this service we were the ones that are not here sister Johnny and the ones that we think of now that are not with

Quinn back from that long trip that he took Lord I pray that you'd give him strength also father just bless us today Lord in this continuation of this service in Jesus name we pray amen alright 60a Romans 6 verse 12 we're going to bring in one little thought that I kind of yesterday was yesterday was a struggle I am working two people's jobs for the last few days and sometimes your mind gets a little foggy but at least I got one so thank you all right that's it right and I've been and but you know why sometimes though when you sit there and the numbness of your brain you get a thought because you're not thinking about nothing else you can't get nothing to come up and then all of a sudden God goes you know stick this in there somewhere so I think we will so today we're gonna speak about I am the resurrection but we're also good I want you to keep in the back of your mind the word omnipotence the word omnipotence which is all powerful and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood stars of heaven fell upon the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and they have been departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and every island was moved out of their place and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men the chief captains in the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne looks like they have no hope they don't for the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand you may be seated I was thinking yesterday too they we've been kind of running around this point and the point is that this has all happened because we're gone we kind of touched on it the other day but whatever is going on here is an is an event that cannot happen while we're here that scripture cannot be fulfilled until the bride of Jesus Christ leaves the earth so you and I are holding off that part of that wrath but listen have you ever thought of this though when we come to a place that we have a body change and that death is destroyed on into very may I say the death hole of the universe this is the death hole of the universe there's no death on Mars or on Venus that is in the earth there's death here because this is where man fell but think about it though you and eyes being that we come to a body change think of how the earth is gonna react to this that's how the earth is going to react to this that's how the natural earth is going to react when a bride stands on the earth with a glorified body the dead Saints have already come out of the ground they've got their glorified body our bodies changed we get ready to step into another dimension and when we step into another dimension all hell's gonna break loose because we're gone because we come to a place we come to a position that's why this six seal right before the seventh opens it's right perfect in place which we know it is but then I get to see more and more how that it is more in place that you and I have a lot to do with this sixth seal it will not open cannot open until we're gone it's barred there's no way it cannot happen until the bride of Jesus Christ leave the earth go into another dimension we've already took a body change I was staying talking about this morning we're talking about in Hebrews about Melchizedek Melchizedek female Kansa it was not your Savior that flesh male candidate when when God I like to say it this way when God slow down enough to come into this dimension because remember brother Brahim said the dimensions are faster that's why there's other dimensions called there faster dimension when God slowed down and come into this dimension he put a body of sixteen element flesh on talk to Abraham now he didn't take that back into the dimension that he came from no note that the off any man went back in there now I would say when he went through that curtain and got a lot faster that that flesh just melted back down into the earth but now when Jesus Christ when Jesus Christ went up into another dimension he took that flesh with it because that's your example in my example he is standing in another dimension faster than this one with a glorified flesh body amen so that's our example that you and I are not going to step through now sure when natural death comes you step through into a faster mentioned what happens you have to lead the flesh here alright you have to lead the flesh here no man on earth has took his flesh with him into another dimension your theophany goes in another dimension and your body goes into the earth but when you step back into here it's all gonna meet right back together that is redemption not replacement a man that is redemption well the hell how you doing you good good to see buddy good to see you brother hell with us you not been feeling too good he's feeling better now looking good anyway can hardly see him behind brother John but in John 11 verse 23 let's pull it up we were talking here about the resurrection let's let's talk about that just a minute Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again well now he's he's true in two points he's fixing to raise him up but he's gonna rise again in the resurrection because remember Lazarus died and he's gonna have to be resurrected a man Jesus resurrected him temporary but you and I get a temporary resurrection we've seen people raised from the dead well that's temporary that person is going to die again but not when we come to this resurrection when we come to this resurrection that we're talking about death has been destroyed there is no other death we've already died we're dead in Christ the dead in Christ shall rise first Martha said unto him I know he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day we're at the last day she's talking about here jesus said unto her I am standing here ever-present right now I am the resurrection he didn't finish that he said I am the life so whatever life you lose Christ is gonna bring you back you say well we you know we die what we do we lose our life on Earth but that life doesn't end it goes into another dimension but I promise you one thing God is gonna call it back God's gonna call it back into this dimension through who I am thank you you'll learn in a minute hey don't get sleepy on me today y'all and had cake lucky where it did last week I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me not only in me though he were dead now how in the world how in the world are you gonna be de I didn't believe on him in him that's what he just said he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live there's got to be somebody alive to believe for those that went on because if you're going on you're believing is over I don't believe I'm going to 6 dimension I'm standing in it if I go by the grave amen but there's somebody here this kind of believing him though he were dead yet shall he live he was trying to get Martha to believe like he believed amen and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this I mean you've got to believe that I was telling the Sunday school this morning it's just lies in our believing it lies in our believing we have we got all the message we got seals are open we got all these things it lays in us believing what's already been said about us amen and I think we're beginning to do that we're beginning to see that we have been in our own mind we have separated ourselves and we become like tunas you know we face us in Christ over there somewhere else you know no it's not it's not you in Christ it's Christ in you the hope of glory all right so let's read the six let's read this now I tell you what I did for some of you that got them quote they ran me off one and I'm garbled the numbers up but when they ran another one off we need to get some ink because it was all messed up and when I started writing it off he couldn't read it so anyway our I ran my copy off and just go by the quotes I'm not gonna skip them just go one two three all right so this is obviously number one now what we're talking about the other week we know that this sixth seal is the judgment seal it's the judgment seal now look that's what I mean about you and I have already been judged my judgment lies in Christ my judgment lies in what he's done my judgment even lies in to here standing in a glorified body in another dimension waiting on me because you know what that man over there in that seventh dimension called Jesus Christ with a glorified body it's not going to come back here until the Millenium all this is done without him being on earth in his human mortal immortal body because you're his body he's going to do it through you this is this judgment seal and remember the whole world is going to be judged by us we're even judging angels this what world is judged by you by the seven churches group from the day of Pentecost till the day we walk out of here when we go to the white throne judgment to judge not in judgment the people that will on earth will be judged by you and Paul's age and Irena San Martin you know why because it's gotten human flesh Thrones we're going to be in Thrones at the white throne judgment we're going to be there not standing down there standing up here judging the whole world I read you that scripture a long time ago where the Saints will even judge a Jules we're not even supposed to take our brother to court now that doesn't mean somebody's not a brother so don't get me wrong but you're not supposed to take a brother of the court you know where you supposed to judge things if your church member Church group not member church group you're supposed to do all your judging in this building right here that's what the Bible says take the judgment not out to the world because you know what they will not understand some things that we understand amen but now somebody else that's a different story but a brother should never take a brother of the court that's absolutely wrong all right and if you can't get it settled here there's an alford up here for one of you to get safe or both of you or all of you amen but here's the breaking fourth of the judgment upon the people we're out of the tribulation judgment will come forth 144,000 redeemed you sly brother Dale said this morning everybody has to die except the bride now some of the brides have going on but everybody there's got to be a group of bride that will not die to fulfill the scripture so somebody it's gonna happen to and don't worry Abraham was ninety and nine so age doesn't have anything to do with it okay Abraham was ninety nine when he got to change all right so this has nothing to do with the bride remember we're already gone we don't see the bride's gone can't place us anywhere else setback in the nineteenth chapter of the book of that's revelations not Act notice for the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word everybody got that you should I've read it for eleven weeks in the room all right now number two we'll get real quick to this pull up number two now we find out also in this that the sixth seal now open in a three-fold purpose now look the sixth seal open in a threefold manner and so did the seventh seal open in three full matter when we get to the seventh seal we're going to see that it open in the threefold manner also then we go back to Christ the mystery God revealed in that opened in a three-fold matter so you see there's a three-fold purpose for these last few ones I'm telling you we talked about this how or to each seal is as I get into each one I see the net the one that one's important and then when I we leave the fifth seal I said man then can't nothing be no more important than the fifth seal when I get in a sixth seal well that becomes more important than the fifth seal so you just keep you God just keeps bringing things out you know because the sixth seal being the judgment sealed and all judgments done under that seal all judgment because remember when we go to the white throne judgment it will be judged what's on this earth and then and that will happen during this time listen the bride is gone everybody else has to die naturally physically die and some have to stay dead for a thousand years amen even the foolish virgin even the cup of water in my name they have to be dead for a thousand years before the white throne judgment okay but now you and I do not but being this sixth seal is open it's open because it's a judgment seal but it also is a purging seal what does judgment do judgment purges out the wrong what judgment do it when you judge something you judge the wrong and it purges it out or as we say in modern times you come before a judge and he sentences you to incarceration or freedom same thing with this judgment is the same thing incarceration or freedom all right that's why brother Branham said he said when you come to them doors every church service you either get what better or worse why because you judge judgment it begins in the house of God you're either gonna get worse and take back out that door what you brought in knowing you should have got rid of it are you gonna get rid of it in here and be happy when you go outside okay so that's what the judgment is and it is this is the judgment is for purification that's what judgment is it purifies everything it puts all the bad guys in prison and supposedly if it worked well puts all the bad guys in prison and all the good guys get to work get freedom it purges the bad stuff so that's what he's doing with us he's doing that in this sixth seal sanctification he's purging us completely out and taking us in a rapture it's for a three-fold purpose now here was the purposes the first name the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation for purification she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period we see they wind up over here in Revelation 7 between the 6th and 7th chapter that she had been purged she had been given her robes now she's not the bride but it's the church two pure people that that didn't have the opportunity to receive the message or in some way they were blinded by these false prophets we see that happening now and they didn't get a chance and yet they're really sincere in heart because you know what God does know the heart God knows your heart he knows your heart right now he knows what's going on he knows what's going on with your heart so he knew they would be sincere in heart and hear their purge during this time you notice that another purging that's for Israel when she's gathering that's the second fold God purges Israel in the Tribulation Period out of the millions that are gather there there'll be a select 144,000 and they will be purged also God purging Israel why he's purging Israel so he can take her in the 144,000 has got to be purged they got to die before they can go over into another dimension because when God wipes this thing off like brother Dale so much the Battle of Armageddon this man pushing buttons it's all it's an atomic war all right but we're not gonna be here for this virgin is actually going to be in the ground also so it is 144,000 you're under sentence you know what I'm saying saying ground but they're not gonna be in this dimension the millions of new looking at the minute of them you see what it is God's purging Israel now watch now there's a whole earth to be purged there'll be such a thing that the moon stars in all nature will be purged you see what it is the earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the Millennium the millenniums coming up and see everything that's got any filth in it is to be purged during the sixth seal so the sixth seal is your purging seal and that's the same thing with you and I because you know what death has got to be purged out of us death itself the little thing that we always have that problem with that little dark thing called death that we're all heading toward it's got to be purged out of us to where it does not bother us anymore okay done all right say man that's all right with me I'm telling you I hate funeral I don't like them you know why I just don't this is the separation in there you know all right let's go to the next one now let's talk about this just for a second what we've been talking about the fifth seal we saw was justification which would be the highest form of justification God given eternal life to a group of people that didn't even want it what about grapes that's the greatest grave still there is right there and that's the greatest great seal that you're sitting here today that you weren't in Wesley's Asian Luther's age and Pentecost age some of you came out of that penticoff stage that's all right I'm glad you came out amen because you look at this now at the sixth seal what is sanctification cleaned and set aside for service now listen we've already been put in service by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen we've already been put in service we have eternal life in our soul we've been put in service but God wants to use you more he doesn't want you to be a baby but we were talking about downstairs in Hebrews chapter 5 he said Paul says the reason you can't understand these things because your babies you drink milk he said but strong meat is for those that are mature that's why we want to be a mature church you know why because when that Holy Ghost and fire falls we'll know how to use that power without character is what satanic but power with character it's fit to rule and then so when we see that the listen it's God in you it's God the Holy Ghost in fire comes in and burns that old nature well you know what it's doing it's burning the rest of it out he killed the old man I hope he did you can't be married to Christ and have two husbands hey man so if you're all if you're born again today your old man's dead and you're married to Christ but then as you married to Christ you are a bride but he doesn't want just a bride I've been married 40 years to June she's my wife now it's so scary she's beginning to thing like me Louise she's beginning to thing like me she said something other day and I said that's something might've said let y'all pray for she is him but listen as as we're down here though to understand how Christ in the bride is one you look at your bride and see that you're one amen that's our example but she is him now remember we come to the Seventh Seal which would be when I get back to be a little bit later on that's Holy Ghost and fire comes and burns and you're gonna have to be go with me there for a little while because we're not gonna we're going to back out of it because we still got to be under sanctification because when we come to sanctification that's cleaned and set aside for service alright he's setting us aside we were talking I'm we'll read it today about adoption and about the mechanics and dynamics we got the mechanics we need to dynamics we got one we got to have the other we got to have the Holy Ghost and fire but we got to look at this sanctification as you and I are set aside for not just any service as we were during our sanctification time when we were got first got saved then we got sanctified what God cleaned them the jar up and said it cleaned it and set aside for service then he filled it with the Holy Ghost now look we get many refilling as a Christian all right but this last one is going to be a refilling that doesn't have to be filled anymore your whole cups gonna be full your saucer is gonna run over your spoons gonna fall out your bowl whatever he says I don't throw you so your spoon fell out your bow amen some people have little bitty bowls some people have big ones amen but that's what that Holy Ghost in fire will do it's you know what it's going to do it's going to change your atoms it's going to change you into a glorified body it's not gonna throw this one away worth somebody literally is gonna stand on this earth and just your body is gonna be change you're gonna just absolutely drop right back to a 20 year old person it's going to materialize right where you're standing I don't stir you sow your shovels fell out of your home or you ditch or wherever it is it's a shovel maybe I'll do that every once in a while to keep you all the way okay I mean we need a backhoe for some of this stuff you are me but we got to remember though that we are we have got to remember God didn't come on this earth to separate us God came on this earth as a human to bring us back together amen to bring us back to the brother Dale to somebody this morning mm-hmm you look and see God when God was standing in the Garden of Eden that's what was somebody we don't want to go back to the Garden of Eden where they're still the devil that where there's a obese there we don't won't go back to that part of the Garden of Eden because that was in the Garden of Eden the beast was in the Garden of Eden so I mean Satan was there and then we want to go past that we want to go back into the side of our maker into that Genesis 1:26 man amen and that's where we want to reside in the Garden of Eden because when God stood in the Garden of Eden there stood Adam and then there come Eva that was one person that was one individual person flesh of his flesh bone of his bone that's what's going to step on this earth believe it's dialed this number three but that we got justification and sanctification is clean and set aside he has cleaned us to sleep it right there he has cleaned us up during the church ages and sent us a prophet in the end time to tell us what our purpose is remember cleaned and set aside for a purpose brother I believe God sent brother Branham to tell us not how to live right brother Branham this message don't save you this message will kill you if you're not born again so quit worrying about being in the message get in Christ he'll put you in the message he'll put that message inside of you because remember they're one but don't think you got to know this message and this message this message this message this message wasn't sent to get us born again it wasn't people's been born again since Paul's age so God sent a prophet to tell us who we are that God's not up there somewhere God's not out there somewhere God's not in a in a Cree or a Dogma or religion he's a person he's a man and he's inside of you if you're born again and break down oh break the seals what you think he just broke up on paper the seals broken flesh that's where that break it is in flesh my flesh your flesh that's where they break it's not some physical pulling of a seal back reading something on a piece of paper you are written epistle you are the one that God broke the seal - you are the seal grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of your Redemption you're the seal don't know where that came from but that's what sanctification is clean and set aside for a purpose so you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be safe okay didn't you come to be born again by knowing Christ you don't become boring in by knowing the message I'm just telling you the truth this message was sent for a purpose but with man what had happened remember this the message of Elijah is a message of restoration and then a message of restoration he restored Malachi for restore back what the faith of the fathers the faith of the fathers they got born again under the 120 the up room got born again and didn't know who William Branham was Iranians nobody they never knew so listen don't worry about I know the message or I don't know the message no the one who wrote it get to know Christ get to do what Christ said to do brother Brown didn't tell you women not to cut your hair the Bible tells you that so if you're denying if you're denying it you're not denying a man you're denying God don't put it on a man and then if we drink smoking cuts you know what the Bible tells us not to do that brother Adam had to come back to build that back up to a place to where God could speak to us further to work I said where he can speak to us further he could give us a purpose for being here and then our purpose for being here as a body change there is no other denomination there I'm sorry there's no other church age there's no other church age messenger it's either us or nothing this is the life this is it coca-cola's not it this is it this is it there's nothing else left if we don't get this if we can't throw it to somebody else but so I know now we're up against the wall somebody will get it somebody and who's gonna get it oh boy we good but that's what it is there's Christ in you the hope of glory then you'll start learning the message listen I read this message who was it where were we was it Anna did you ask me that question in Bible study yes Hannah come on Anna sorry Muruga and I'm going to ask me a question now you know my background I grew up in this church from 1971 actually from 1968 I was 8 years old mm-hmm and then I grew up in the message and then I studied the message I said here and you know what I had the ability to read I was a smart kid sorry I was the other ones are a little different but they were they were they were harder but but I taught them all I need now left but no listen not being funny I read the message of the hour I understood the major doctrines they were not hard for me to understand even at a fourteen-year-old kid but I'll promise you one thing I'll promise you I wasn't born again I might have been saved I might have just got God to forgive me of my sins one day when I came up here the pulpit was what used to be right here the pulpit was right here and the piano was right there that was a wall it was a little room went back by where Tony's that and then the row of seats went like this and the front door was right there anybody got that so I I came up and I I I cried I asked God to forgive me of my sins but you know what I did I didn't go any further but what I done though I packed this in by the letter by the letter brother Tom folks got a lot of my books I think they still got some of them where you could see where I wouldn't make knows and a 14 year old boy and I was a born again I proved that for about 19 years let's think about this morning you know I've even got my house number brother Joe in my future home you know your house number my house number is zero seven one nine nine eight because that's the month and the year I got born again July 1998 I got born again but yes sister Ana I went through all them years no one the message was right I could sit here and read and tell you exactly what it was so it's not the man she's just gonna save you the letter of it know when I came to the altar in December of 1997 stood right here I gave my heart to God and I started reading the Bible the Bible not the message I had already read the message that I was reading the Bible to see where I needed Christ in my life and then six or eight months later I got the new birth in July of 1998 and then you know what all that started hitting on all the cylinders it wasn't just that it was sex in the garden now the serpent seeds standing here today not me but it is here hey man the seed of the serpent how'd you get here physically okay so it's still here see what I'm saying but now by the grace of God I'm telling you by the grace of God my walk in life was that I went through all those years knowing in the very back part of my mind there was a seed planted it was the word it had to be quickened though for it to do any good so it didn't when I came up in gave my heart to God it didn't quicken the word immediately you have to go through a process of justification sanctification he sanctified me cuz I got baptized in January it was cold I got baptized in January of 1998 and when I come out of that water I felt so empty I stood there in hook gym for blo 15 minutes I guess just crying like a baby but when I when I let go of her my whole insides was like it rest like there was nothing in me sanctified cleaned and set aside for service well you know what I didn't say I got it I knew that I had to continue going up until July we were at Lake Malone in Kentucky on a vacation with June's parents a lot of them were heathens I mean raw heathen and here I was sitting in the motorhome reading a message and I can't remember what the nothing what the message was sorry I can't but there was an emotion came over me not of crying not of weeping and sobbing but an emotion came over me of power something came to me and when I have to look back down and started reading I just raised my hand to God I said thank you finally it's over you got to come to that to say finally it's over and then you come to rest but you don't rest no you can run outside and jump in the lake you know do something you know dude then you can have some emotion but it was just a feeling of power not it not that I could pick the motorhome up but just something came upon me that said hey this is it so see that was a new birth but you know what every time I open this book and every time I study the message and every time I read the Bible I get that same power I get that same confidence my heavens if God Almighty is your father and he's living inside of you you should have confidence you should walk out into this world and say I'm a son and daughter of God but I walk never stops it continues oh sure we all fall and we get up we follow we get up that's part of being a Christian listen if God don't chastise you you're a bastard child anyway you're not even his so don't worry things will happen I never want to see it none you think boy when you get the new birth and you start coming back to church boy you you know you're gonna be no I was the sickest you know daddy no I was the sickest from 1998 to about 2001 I had everything in the world happened to me some of the most I'll tell you about in private weird stuff weird stuff weird I mean where'd you go where did that come from but you know what it was God turning the devil loose on me just like he did job said well you can't touch your soul you can't touch his life but you sure can't do what you need to do because you know what that's my boy that's my child that's my son that's my daughter same thing with you I'm not saying anything to make me I'm just up here to tell you that your walk should be pretty close to that if you're not you're missing something if you don't you know they sometimes like brother Gary actions sometimes you know he says God speak to you he said three months four months God don't say a word but you know what it's child training it's child training I mean if every time I got in trouble I run to Daddy and daddy would just give me you know here's a thousand dollars so don't take care of your problem well you know what I be a small bright but when I was looking for my father I couldn't find him my natural father it was the heavenly fathers who I had to look for so when you look for your heavenly father when you start having problems don't start calling people honest where we get to that priest thing you know call the priest he'll take care of it no call you daddy how long died got going Savior so anyway mama tried to save me for 20 years she did a good job but she's not the Savior but mothers do that because they're wired different jinns the same way she tries to save all our kids but that's okay I mean that's just a mother part I'm not saying anything bad about it I'm just saying God has to do the work you can't mama can't daddy can't you must do the work God must do the work in you and through you alright so now that we've got all that done where were we but remember those are clean and set aside for service you already went through that one time when God brought you for a purpose to the place now it's see now look I'm gonna tell you something and we'll tell you something when I come and gave my heart to God now remember they certain things you still gonna have problems with specially under justification cuz the unclean spirit hadn't won out yet so be careful don't worry about that but see you got a step over into sanctification where after I was baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ that God when I come out of that water I felt a cleansing process the things I needed or wanted just totally went away most of you know I chewed tobacco every day of my life every day from 14 years old till that day I got saved and then God took it away just like a light switch and you know as well as I do some of you fought the cigarettes and at the back and you fight different things now listen there's other things I fought don't think I'm perfect there's other things I fought still fighting right there's things I fought though that there's things that I didn't there's things you just went totally away and I didn't that when I stepped out the next day no desire now see that's only God Satan won't ever do that that's God all right so you got to see that though in your own life that you made that step to sanctification and then you got to not stay there and say well I'm fine I feel good you know I could have come out of the water there in January and I said man I'm born again I just all of my cares have went away no I knew that God had to bring some kind of a quickening power to quicken you to the word not to anything else but to the Word of God so that you can start so that you listen so you can start understanding why serpent seeds the way it is you can understand why the Lord Jesus Christ is a baptism not that you can just read good brother Brian said it's just plain reading to be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ it's just plain reading the sea serpent seed and all these different things but when you get a revelation revelation you can't I surf and seed from the garden all waiter today that I didn't do because it wasn't born again but now since I got the guy inside of me that wrote the book same with you there's no different than me and you I just had a little bit of a background I read cuz I love to read I read the message I just had all that laying there then God quickened it which thank God for that you ought to thank God for that for everything he's giving you you ought to thank God for it and then everything he gives you one revelation that's something he don't to everybody else he gives it to you alright so walk with God do the things of God I came to church I read in my Bible I started doing the things I was supposed to do hey man that's the key I didn't come up here and say all god save me and then you didn't see me for three months nobody know that's just like we talked about finding Jesus in jail that's just getting called hello that's what all people do they find Jesus in jail so the judge will say oh he's converted didn't they go out and kill somebody they find Jesus in jail no they just got caught come and confess your sins to God get rid of the thing and then do what he said walk in what he said start reading the Bible there's your key really don't worry about the message read the Bible it will direct you straight to the message I'll promise you because it should have done every one of us that last while we're sitting here today he directed us to a place you ought to thank God every day that he showed you this message where am I hallelujah that's I'm sorry he wasn't the only word he was God himself the dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave so it doesn't matter if somebody's body is close to him dead in the grave Jesus's was but when what was inside of him step back into that flesh i quickened him power shake into life and rise again and he didn't have to roll away the stone I believe all he done was just did this with his fingers he just did that and stone went over yeah it wasn't even an effort he could have walked through the stone he walked through the wall to business that disciples right after that didn't he so our stones not gonna hold him in the grave surely no Roman seal is gonna keep him there I am he that was dead so dead till the son said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star says dad sorry brother Hal Moore do Brist real fast all nature said he was dead she says I get too fast for him and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again why because you and I are here he was not only the mechanics God's Word he was the dynamics to prove it and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth cause it's part of him when he resurrected you were inside of him amen well I tell you we've already been to hell when he that Saturday that body may late cold stiff in the grave but his theophany was down into hell in another dimension telling them people who he was in the days of Noah those people he said I'm the one so brother Larry if you got the same theophany part inside of you you already been to hell you don't have to ever go again wherever he went that's where I was hey if brother Brown said oh we always go oh hallelujah we walk the shores of Galilee with him how live rather on him we went to hell with him - hey man good you don't have to go you already been because it's part of him and he can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others have spoke of the bride whoa it can only manifest now who's it going to manifest food the bride if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power hang on to that Germans have the cake hang on to that because we're going to talk about that in just a minute that says power of his power she is him as man and woman who want a woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminist part from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and dynamic until the Church of the people until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics in the spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if he had on 16 cylinders so will the bride a man for he said in John 14 12 he did believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics see I had the mechanics I had the mechanics I had read with my eyes in my brain had forged that in my brain Christ the mystery God revealed seven seals seven church age is Daniel seventy weeks I'd read them books when I was fourteen years old that was forged in my hand I didn't forget it why because I would need it but then when the dynamics come it charged that what I had held he didn't believe it on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll ride raise him up again at the last day that's the Easter message the dynamics and mechanics together my mechanics without the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics you see people shout and jumping up and down they don't even know what the message says it just feels good well that's layout to see you it just feels good do it you can shout scream and shout jump up and down all you won't do and deny this word it won't do any good you're just cranking around the Pistons got this got the spark there to fire but no gasoline to fire it only works as they come together amen so one will sit still the other one will go up that's the only way there is to it you know what he's talking about there's one church gonna stay here and the bride's gonna leave so she gets both mechanics and dynamics but one has mechanics and dynamics it brings it the past of what he says the truth it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics comes when the dynamics come that fires made to connect with that octane in the gasoline then that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for here's the same yesterday today and forever alright let's move on to number four is the rising of the Sun same message that's that divine revelation of the word made flesh who is that you if it was flesh in that day by the Sun the groom it's the flesh today by the bride whoso sins you remit they were emitted whoso sins you've retained their retained I just told you that that's what judgment is now the Catholic Church picked it up and took it to the priest but that's carnal watch it was the spiritual revealed word that did it babies babies not babies it was a spiritually revealed word to mature people that will do it ma'am John 1:14 says what and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth now listen I ask you a question about that it's why I put it up there again watch that scripture and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father now let me ask you a question we know Jesus was begotten of the father right right now I want to ask you a question are you begotten of Jesus are you begotten to the Father if you've begun to Jesus your grandchild God don't have grandchildren so your begotten of the Father so that whole scriptures view you say full of grace and truth you better have some and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory we know that was Jesus Christ but I wasn't begotten him Jesus Christ who was begotten of the father that makes me a grandchild now I was begotten to the Father who was that Jesus Christ we know Laurie amen look at number five seeds not air with a shuck then Along Came sanctification how many believes in scientific a sure we did you believe the Bible you have to that's what I mean you there is that's what people most people in the message they just believe the message and think they're born again know no no you must be justified Christ is the only person that can justly forgive you of your sins no one else God's the only one that can clean you up and put you aside for service just a Bible we got to go back and see the Bible and then when we see the Bible Way of justification sanctification I love the future home brother branham gets all the way up to telling us about the apex of the message the future home where we're going to live for an eternity our city he says don't forget to plan a Redemption he said don't forget justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost he said that's what I've taught from the beginning and he said I see that it's still true today he didn't change his 1963 people say no 1963 so I just got to believe the message how the devil believes the message the devil believes in one garden trembles that's what the scriptures say no we got to get the essence of this message because look when we come to when you come to Pentecost you got the restoration the gifts brother Brian want him on the scene when the Holy Ghost fell in 1906 weren't even born yet when he will not went on Einhorn is born so 1906 Azusa Street brother Brian one name of all wasn't even born when the Holy Ghost fell on that day of Pentecost right they call it the initial evidence of Holy Ghost speaking in tongues now remember the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness of the baptism during that time to be the messenger but remember what didn't man do man stopped it man is the one that stopped and says speaking in tongues is it you don't speak in tongues you ain't got the Holy Ghost you know what God did God just moved right on just like the stock had life in or the two shoots had life in it the stock had life in it at one time the shuck had life in it at one time that's the Pentecost and held the grain but now remember what we're going to read right here that shuck has got to pull away to show the grain because the shook is not the great Chuck had life in it but the shuck is not the grain it protected the grain like I've said many times before brother Branham could not have come on the scene and been as effective as he was if it hadn't been for Pentecost think about it they had been for Pentecost and he went to the Pentecostal people because they accepted him the Baptist sure didn't the Methodists sure didn't they after a while they said no we don't want nothing to do with that but the Pentecostals because he had a little bit of that gift working and all that but remember that was the bait on the hook the hook was to get a body changed the hook was to bring the revelation to the seven seals thank God the sun's out our storms over thank God that was a lot of rain a minute ago but look speaking in tongues they call it the initial evidence speaking in tongues there they call the initial evidence which brought forth what the shock but they denominated but when you come to say I and my father are one and these other things then the shuk pulls away from it what is the shirt the shirt looks like the grain because it's kind of shaped like it why is it shaped like the grain because the grains got a shape inside I mean if the grains dislike if the grains like this the shirts gonna be like that because it covers it but remember a week is less almost like a football so the shuck has to do this over the top of it but see you shake that shuck off to get to the seed because there's where the life is and that's me and you the shuck pulls away why they can't stand to go on into the seed they can't go into the seed because they're not seed now you say well they're not born again know that I didn't say that they weren't seed for this time because when God moved on he brought seed for the end time because remember I will restore what restore back to seed that went in the ground but the real genuine bride Church will bring forth the entire Word of God in its fullness and in its strength for he is the same yesterday today and forever all right there bow out with that same man now let's go to John 14 real quick and I will the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive I was thinking I want it I want you to do something for me just just something silly you sit down and do crossword puzzles I do word scape on my on my phone I'm confessing today I do little puzzles on my phone to kind of clear my brain every once in a while once in the morning while in the afternoon but just write down I was thinking about yesterday everybody's looking each other going I'm doing this minecraft so anyway we all have our little quirks but I lost my thought no take it I was thinking driving down the road yesterday you know I made mention the other day about what a cult is a cult or even something that they could come against us as it's normal practice you know what whatever whatever is normal to the world I want you to sit down one day and I want you to just list everything that you used to do hide it know everybody see it but then right now what you do now and look at what the world could see this was what the world still does this is normal I was thinking you know earrings girls wear pants to church now all that's normal that's normal in the outside world tattoos are normal it's okay don't worry about it two threes and high love this on my own whatever anyway you know earrings that is all normal that's accepted practice in 99% of the nominations of the world they've even got coffee shops and churches they've even gotten now they got a place where you got cup holders where you can bring your coffee in and sit down and have church you know but that's normal that's becoming normal it's normal for them to go to a bar and have a beer doesn't matter if you like this old saying goes you know a Baptist will talk to you unless he's in a liquor store think of that but that's become normal to them though that's all no smoking cigarettes the Baptist's always hated people that drink that's why they tell it Joe the Bible just hated people to drink with that smoke so they justified that somehow so but you look over here and write a list of things that's normal and then write what you do we're the most abnormal people in the world we don't even think like this world are you shouldn't I mean your thought process is not even like the world thank God is not like the world thank God he watched me and clean me up cleans you up and we don't have to go by accepted practices I mean think about it go inside your home and look at things that other people would be normal you know the cigarette lighter and a cigar machine and you know you see these things when you deliver mail you deliver them to the Baptist preacher you know anyway so I but now remember but see that's normal he's not gonna get in trouble with you know will get in trouble for any of that you know glia trouble for going to church with your pants on sisters in a Baptist Church now even about shorts you see men going in with short now that's accepted practice to them to you and I Oh will be totally abnormal Amen why because we've been changed our whole attitude that's why this world is not our home but there's enough of this world I've known about this earth not the world there's enough of this earth that's gonna bring me right back to here cuz this is mine this was our earth before Satan became a squatter this is my er this is my earth and God come in and mating his earth even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive but just do that something I'm just kind of run through your mind all the things that you see people do that's accepted practice and then you try to think of them you're just weird we're just weird we don't even claim like that we're like what in the world are they thinking but you know what it's just accepted practicing like me and that man was talking yesterday brother he's he's he and he's not a Baptist he don't know what he is he's definitely not a Baptist cuz he's talking started talking my marriage and divorcing and this is the denominational guys don't tell my marriage in divorce he said what do you think he said we got Deakins as mayor three or four times and all my stuff I said well you know what the Bible says he's here I don't know what the Bible says he said let your wife committed adultery unless your wife's dead you can't marry again woman can't ever marry again where we been but that's all normal they can do that out there but we don't do that well when you start talking about marriage and divorce people get quiet you can shout about everything in the world but when you start saying when you say them two words or three imagined divorced everybody goes you couldn't go in all day and not say nothing about that we've all had our problem but you know what there's that God's might away God's made away I promise you once you get born again you won't ever do it again remember brother Bram said go on his y'all don't ever do it again all right so so so be thankful for grace but let's don't make it greasy graves because see they've made a greasy grace out there cuz the first thing they tell you I'm telling you talk to somebody and talk about how perfect you are and how God's made you perfect first thing they gonna say is not ain't perfect you ain't perfect I saw you talking about yourself I'm talking about me I won't say you what God said about me after you tell you what you said about you I said but God said I was perfect I don't know about that you see what I mean that's accepted practice to just make an excuse that you're not perfect it's why I do these things I don't know the angle charge you for that go that well I guess it did have something to do with a sixth seal anyway even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not the world has blinded itself to God because remember they think they're still going to heaven I'm not talking listen when I tell you to right now I'm not telling you right down what a what a drunkard do I'm talking about nominal Christians just write down what they do and then write down what you do because they think they're born again doing these things that's accepted practice now why because of this thing right here weak pulpit and then.we pulpit because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for his dwelling with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while in the world seeth or understandeth me no more they've lost the understanding of Christianity but ye see me because we have it because I live now see that's what brother Branham it took a prophet to turn us back to that right way of living but remember that wasn't his message it was part of it it was to restore and then bring the seals and then bring the revelation statue a perfect man and all those all those things to show Christ in you the hope of glory at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you looks like there's one person standing there he's not three look I and my father in da9 you but if I'm in my father he's in the same place if ye and me we're in the same place you're not moving three people around you got one person all right I'm trying to cut this thing short here let's go the next one here you him talk about oh let's read this one the supernatural something taking place his garment glistened like the Sun in the middle of the day as wide as they could be God placed on him that robe of immortality showing that he had received him now remember this was Matthew 17 mount transfiguration when the adoption came but now remember when he put that robe of immortality on on Christ remember it was temporary six months later he died you can't die any mortal person it was showing a position that he had come to alright that's the thing that God will do to his sons here on the earth someday he will call you a side Church if you'll only obey Him who obey Christ obey Christ and stay on the word and believe it and he will place into the church before the coming of Jesus Christ he will place into the church all the powers that Christ had in him will be in the church all that God was he poured into Jesus all that Jesus was he pours into the church God wanting his work done he sent it into his son the son wanting the work done sent it into the church at that day because the same power of God was in Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ the same power that rested in Jesus Christ rest into place sons in the body of Christ amen placing up a son take him out a certain place have a ceremony before angels place them positionally that's what the statute of perfectman does it places you positionally what he is in the body of Christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this not on that very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done now brother branham is prophesying he's opening something up that will be done he said if you count me up for now this what I'm telling you will be done what there'll be a power put into the church and now is coming in that the Holy Spirit will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it will create itself right there we haven't seen powers left like that coming into the church now now listen this is 1960 brother Adams went through almost what 23 years of seeing healing after healing after feeling after anointing after dead being raised sick being healed we haven't seen powers that likes coming into the church now I know it for a fact saying to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said shall come to pass you can have what you have said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then critics mouths will be shut oh don't you think there's critics hey man there's critics amen the critics mouth will be shut it will be a short time Jesus came right off the mountain and went straight to Calvary that's what a man he he had that robe of immortality on him but six months later he went to Calvary right here notice it won't last long but it'll be there there's your prophet telling us what we're going on all right and let's read the next one maybe just a touch longer today but it'll be okay we'll be fine we'll go outside for two hours and stand talking anyway why did he say in Malachi 4 would restore restore by the original Pentecostal faith now that's what the first part of his message was to I mean you've been looking at my honey and hombre sorry back to the pitch should have slapped me all the way back to the people with the same Pentecostal message the same Pentecostal sign the same Pentecostal evidence the same God the same power the same teaching everything exactly with the vindication of the same pillar of fire that struck Paul down on the road down to Damascus amongst us today doing the same things he did in that day uniting we see the nations uniting we see the world uniting we see the church is uniting we see the bride uniting uniting with the word 1 the word is God and as the word as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the hearer of the word they come together in a union that unites wedding see they're getting ready for a wedding and they become one the word becomes you you become the word how much plainer can that be we've read these quotes ins 1963 but you know what they mean a lot more to me now than they did six months ago two years ago or whenever I read it last time an they you not like a wedding they're getting ready for a wedding they become one the word becomes you you become the word jesus said that that day you know what all the father is I am all I am you are and all you are I am Wow in that day you know that I mean the father father me iron you and you and me see that day what day this day we find out the great hidden mystery of God being revealed and what I tell you the great mystery of God is Christ in you the hope of glory that God can walk around on this earth and be so abnormal but walk around here on the face of the earth and be God walking on two feet amen oh how I like that he said all right let's go to that now this is the second part I want I want us to get to this and then we'll close gone 11:25 jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this so let's hear what brother Graham said this go tell my disciples 19 this is 1953 he went to the grave of lives was crying like a man tears rolling down his cheek as you wept and stood there and a man that had been dead for days and the skin worms crawling in and out of his body but see him raised his little figure locked out and say I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die think of it he that believeth liveth and believeth in me shall never die what hope we have this morning then when we visit our grave our loved ones what I hope we have in this mortal flesh today as the Holy Spirit bears record he lives what in your mortal flesh shall never die has ever lasting life yet we packed the body over the graves of the saintly of us but inside they are alive they're living somewhere now remember he'd know you'd been behind the curtain of time at that at that point it's 1953 when he stood and said I am the resurrection and the life and there was a man laying there he said take away the stone and the contamination of his body that odor of a human body you know what it is when they raised up why it was a sickly smell around here but you know what he did that bother him it bothered Martha it didn't bother him but he spoke out and said Lazarus come forth and a man that had been dead for days rose up from the grave now where is a resurrection voice message at it's in me and you all right so one of the reason I read that forget about the circumstances well it looks pretty bad it stinks there's a sickly smell around here what death and embalming Jesus he'd already told him he was all right let's go to the next one number nine or the next one then Jesus came a-calling 1964 neither has he changed yet just as much God tonight as he ever was she asked my brother branham he was trying to get the people to see he was God right there he wasn't a historical God he changes not and he knew she knew that it was him was just a few minutes it proved it when she said something to him about her brother said Lord I believe that you are and he said watch I am the resurrection and the life though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth me shall never die I am that's the I am was in the burning bush with Moses I am the resurrection I am the life I was the wall I am still he I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die after this great assurance that she had that he was the promised word when he said being a prophet he could not lie therefore he when he said I am the red he said I am the I am now that's not in the scripture but it's hooking the scriptures together he knew it was the same person who spoke to Moses in the burning bush it's the same person who gave you the new bars that's why it's the I am I am he that is the resurrection and the life are we thinking about Jesus so we're thinking about the Jesus inside of us are let's go to the next one number 10 or whatever the next one is excuse me then Jesus came and called 1964 now when she heard she was right he said I am the resurrection and the life I am old watering assurance that the promise word for he was that I am that was in the wilderness with Moses back there in the burning bush even when all hope was gone yet she was satisfied if she could only get him to ask it would take place now how we need faith like that today now she had to believe for the impossible here's the whole thing this is the whole key we've got to believe something that's totally impossible we've got to believe for something that's totally but what's the believing it's believing unto that all things are possible to him that believes she had to believe for the Impossibles to the modern mind listen to the modern way of thinking we're not gonna get a body change we're just going to die and come up in a resurrection with something brand-new that's what the denominations and most of people in this message if you nail them down they don't think there's enough to get this thing around here changed but if it changed Jesus's body is gonna change mine hey man didn't bother him one bit now she had to believe for the Impossibles yet the modern mind modern way of thinking she had to believe for the impossible but impossible things are made real when God has took at his word the Impossibles has made realities when God is taken at his word amen alright let's go to number 11 junction of time I like this one now here's what we're going to bring this word in but I want you to see what this word means in just a minute there you walk to the grave omnipotence manifesting here among us living with us God in Christ reconciling the world to himself here he lived with us God proving himself through his son Christ Jesus he was omnipotent and miraculous and if he's the same yesterday today and forever where is that omnipotent and miraculous person at may I interpolate where's yet he's in you he said I will never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world how can we look for anything else but when he speaks for them for when he speaks for the miraculous to happen how can we expect anything else so here he goes down to the grave of weeping and then omnipotence gathered itself together hey a prophet could only say that and then I'll nipa thence gathered itself together and he spoke Lazarus come forth and the man who was already rotting his nose that fell in his face for four days the skin worms had done set in corruption knew its master hallelujah think about what happened inside that tomb what kind of reaction took place inside that tomb for that body then skin worms to go away and for his nose to come back and for everything to come back and shake that body back to life old man if he can do it we can do through him we can do this he gave back to life of this dead man and a man that was once dead stood on his feet and lived again the miraculous I am the resurrection and the life saith God he did believe it in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die speak omnipotence miraculous will take place now it's God here to speak in the tomb of left frontal tomb of Lazarus it's God here today in human flesh and yours speak omnipotence miraculous will take place and you always do it at the junction we're at a junction right now folks they might have been in the junction in 1956 but we're at a junction of time right here because we're tight we're fixing blend right into eternity and we're at the junction be alarmed when you see these things happening we're at the end time omnipotent speaks and a dead man dead and lived again stood on his feet and went to a banquet and eat supper with him oh my what happened some glorious day while we were once dead in sin and trespasses omnipotent spoke we were going to hell and omnipotent spoke we've raised from hell to glory and someday we'll eat the banquet supper at the last day omnipotent speaks God's word is omnipotent we believe it and raised from death into life he's a here with my words and believe in me though he were dead yet shall he live whoso liveth and believeth in me shall never die I'm nipa tense you know what I'm nipa tense means pull it up pull up to the next one where it says entomology you didn't get that one you got that was not on the you didn't get the definition maybe not anyway I'll rep leave it right there the word omnipotence derives from the latin term of me omnipotence meaning all how many means all protein means powerful the meaning of the term omnipotent has been used to connect a number of different positions these positions include but aren't limited to the following a deity is able to do anything that it chooses to do now that's easy for us to say about God wake up for a minute that's the easy to say about God a deity is able to do anything that he chooses chooses to do he's omnipotent and then everybody believe that's a man oh let's read this next quote verse number 12 when he said the expression he made I jotted it down no go back to go back to the one before that when he said no you're up when he said the expression he made I jotted it down on a piece of paper I'll pick it up in my office there to omnipotence met now are they two guards Satan's not all-powerful hello to omnipotence met that's true when God and a believer meet there's two omnipotence because God a man is a part of God he's the son of God and what little he is joins the entire body jesus said in mark 11:22 if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said you can it will come to pass believe that what you said and a Christian is so marked that around him is an atmosphere a Christian is so so I saying about normal abnormal we're so marked abnormal but were the most normal people in the world alright let's go to the bear lap this is the last one and we'll be finished mm-hmm go to last quote Pat miss vision to watch this a man cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like in the Garden of Eden I was going to choke it but I'm gonna say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent now what does I'm member that mean all-powerful did not he say mark 11 whatsoever things you say and don't down in your heart it will come to pass you can have what you've said what happens when to omnipotence meet when God and man comes together through I'm nip tense something's got to shake some whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of an impetus of God knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out you under and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because to omnipotence have met there he stands oh isn't he wonderful to omnipotent to all-powerful meet amen omnipotent means all-powerful I'm just reading you what brother MC about less because the to omnipotence is you and God when two of nimpah tents meet and we believe the word of God knowing that he promised it and he said it in this word it creates a power that I'm gonna interpolate here a power that will change your body cuz remember it's already change your thought process it should already have thought we shouldn't be thinking like we were thinking before why are we still in this message 50 something years we ain't nothing going on yeah they something going on maybe you need to get on the train maybe you need to get the reading quotes like that that is what it'll give you a confidence inside of you that God's already said that about us in 1964 that to omnipotence have met and that doesn't include the devil know where he's totally out of the picture let's stand her feet he's totally out of the picture it's not to omnipotence God in the devil heavily days so where does the power lay the power lays inside of you get going to clap he's the one who did it for you I didn't musicians let's come when to omnipotence meet see listen when you get to have the mind of Christ what else is that you've lost the mind of your human nature of your human even your thoughts look the things that we preach the things that we see and the things that we hear when we mash play the world don't understand that but you're right there in tune with it when you say man you're saying so be it that that's exactly correct cuz what what I'm impotent it's looking at the other one saying that ain't nothing but the truth amen what are you doing back here sing a song where's Richard if he's not coming you play the bait where's rich richer fall out are you right in the system okay huh okay Holly b-flat [Music] I have found the friend in Jesus he's everything let's worship Him now he's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul the lily of the valley in him I see oh I need to cleanse and make me fully whole always sorrow he's my comfort and trouble he's my stay he tells me every care on him to roll he's a name all right and Morning Star he's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul all my leaves have taken and all my sorrows born in temptation he's my strong and mighty town I have all for him Forsaken and all my idols torn from my heart and now he keeps me by his palace no the world forsake me and Satan tempts me soul through Jesus I shall safely reach tangle he's a lily of the valley the bright and Morning Star he's the fairest of ten thousand to my so if I have a name he'll never never leave you nor yet for safety here voila Limbaugh Phelan molested where listen they're the Waterbar around me I'm nothing now to fear with his minor he my so shall feel then sweeping up the rig - she is busted face when we're rivers of delight shall ever old he's a little morning song is the Farish ten thousand to my soul you know I was over in the Philippines I'm Philippines in Jamaica a couple years ago we had that youth camp and this song came on my heart what we were singing that song I felt led I didn't know how we were gonna we weren't gonna have a prayer line we were just gonna you know pray for everybody it was a youth camp and that song did just diverse there stuck out a wall of fire around me I have nothing nada fair so I had all the Deacons and all the brothers in circle all the youth in the whole building several hundred kids and they encircled them and held hands I said okay kids there's a wall of fire [Music] nothing to fear there's a wall around you and brother we started praying and I have not prayed for 30 minutes in my life I'm sorry I just haven't we prayed for over 30 minutes and God did some work inside that ring a fire because they really caught on that they were in a safe place because they had that wall the fire all around them and I said there's nothing out of fear this is what tells you now the wall that fire is gonna keep everything whatever you need to get rid of you just throw it to that wall of fire and let it burn it up and buddy we have a good time but that you look and you see the inspiration of this person whoever wrote this so I'm like a lily of the valley and then all of a sudden he says there's a wall of fire around me there's nothing now to fear he might be the piece of the lily of the valley but there's got to be a fire that wall the fire is all the way around us listen my brother Dale said I don't think you're just I don't think you'll walk through the city of the future home and you're listed like this light bulb but there is a glow over the whole city because of you being there because of you being there and because of you walking in this world jesus said I'm the light of the world well if Jesus said I'm the light of the world so are you you're listen you're walking through a dark place right now sure we got artificial light but when you walk out in that world that's demon territory and you better hope you got a wall of fire around you maybe that you can't see I pray one day they gonna show it to us he'll just show you a little something because you know Satan to love to kill every one of us every breath we take God has protected that breath cuz Satan's standing there wanting to just absolutely cuz if he can get rid of you he's got God whipped because there's nothing in the plan of God that says God can come back here and redo the whole thing again he can't come back here down across again so God's got to put a wall of fire around you because he's protecting what he's already said he's protecting this word and that word walks in you through life you're the word made flesh to omnipotence have met and we are in a place to where now them to omnipotence work together he's never had a group of people that he can work through like he has right now I don't believe that he sure he's used them in the power that they needed in for each time and each church age but right now today we gotta believe the impossible and to believe the impossible we have become the impossible you and I are an impossibility we are we're impossible this should not happen it really think about it think about it like I said when you open the Bible you don't see a Trinity you don't see eating an apple you don't see what about tens imma name father son holder you don't see eternal hell you don't see those things in here now did the Bible change no the omnipotence it wrote it once you're connected to God you can't separate he can't do it brother Louie he cannot sit how can he separate himself he cannot separate himself once he's joined he's vulcanized I wish Ida took that picture in the Philippines we vulcanized here I think that brother Joe I think we need to put that over the back of the window of the door also we vulcanized here amen we vulcanized right here that was a sign in the Philippines that our place is we vulcanize here I don't man we need to stop and take a picture of that because you know I've organized and does it puts two pieces of the same material when to omnipotence meet they become one god bless you let's pray your heavenly Father Lord we've held the people a long time we're sorry for that father but we pray that what we said will be something that will help them through their journey Lord through life and through all the things that we have to deal with Lord is family and and friends and a lot of times try to come against this but Lord you're the only family we have is you you're our Father and Lord you said you said that you that we were the Word made flesh in the end time so Lord it's as we were talking about last night you can't swear by anything else so you swear by it you swore by yourself and to me this Bible is your word that you swore is gonna make come to pass so you swear on yourself and that's one omnipotent well now you've got an omnipotent working in this dimension called the bride of Jesus Christ the Lord I pray that we'll take these things and ponder them in our heart forgive us of our sins be with us on earth on the highways the way home be with the ones that are not here lord save the Lost heal the sick Lord be a brother deck tomorrow Lord just whatever whatever happens Lord we praise it that we all have faith that that thing will be gone before they even get started they will believe that the Lord if the situation occurs Lord just keep them both strong we love with both Lord just like family they are family and we appreciate them Lord we thank you for them now we've come boldly to the throne and asked Lord is tonight and in the morning we all together as a church Lord may may we touch you Lord with the feeling of our infirmities father just be with us now take care of us let's just on our way home and Jesus name we pray amen [Music] I'm alone I see all I need to cleanse and make me fully you
