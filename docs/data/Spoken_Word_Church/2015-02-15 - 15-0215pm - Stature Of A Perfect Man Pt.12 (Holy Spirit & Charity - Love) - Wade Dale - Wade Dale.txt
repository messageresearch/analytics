holy think of him holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy i want to see you there man you want to see him open your eyes and let's look into the word and we'll see him there good to be back in the house of the lord i was i thought y'all should have broke into revival when they were singing that song lord got a new bass player richard you're done for strings are still on it so he's okay good to have sister willie and her family with us i never can remember her name but i know who her daddy is brother willie roth that's why sister willie if you don't mind handing them out please but it's good to have them with us today boy just that that's wonderful it's like brother bob black and now we're standing in the back brother rob said white guy white people can't do that white people just can't do that and it brings me back to that but you know what brother branham did that he he commented on the black people how they knew how their writ had rhythm and they were just happy-go-lucky family and they you know everything and that's the way you're supposed to be you know when we get out of our position is when we get all out of sorts with god but we stay in our position and and uh i believe they honor the gift that god's given amen and use it very well so good to see some really um uh good-looking young young men with them there is there as their family so it's a testament to the to the parents so good to be in the house of the lord good to be back good to uh good to have been here today today this afternoon we're going to get into into the uh maybe the summation of the statue of a perfect man and um if i'm a little bit long just forgive me but we're going to try to get finished today so that you can have your pastor back and uh he's he's fixing to dig into some deep stuff so i and it's not deep it's just it's simple the the more the word opens to you the more simple it should be it should be just if an illiterate person can understand the word of god you are to be able to understand the word of god it's just making yourself available for it all right make yourself available so let's turn back to ii peter 1 and we're going to continue on there with the holy spirit right up to the capstone which is love or charity and like i said remember brother dale he's doing his sister's funeral today and just be just lord bless the family thank you for for the offering this morning that was wonderful i appreciate it it'll be put to good use you know that very well and remember the fellowship meeting look downstairs make sure you read the um announcements on the screen downstairs fellowship meeting brother matthew braille be with us and speaking for us there i think it's on the 20-something of march it's the week i get back from from the philippines so just pray for me and if you got a moment call june while i'm gone and just you know give her a few words of encouragement if she's at home we always joke somebody told her one time said i said don't you this is when i was going hunting a lot you know i'd be gone for a week or so and then they said don't you get tired of him going out and hunting and all this stuff and she said do not ruin my vacation she wasn't talking about maya either she's talking about my don't ruin my vacation but you got to remember one thing absence makes the heart grow fonder that's right so we'll see how three weeks worth of lapses will be on all of us but it's the lord's work and we do i remember brother branham you know he'd be gone for months at a time that was hard but you know what he had a strong wife there to back him up so and he knew that um she was she was i believe she was as great as he was she just couldn't preach because she kept him from the people she kept his clothes washed he did all the things for him god calls a man he absolutely calls the woman or the wife to go with him but second peter chapter one verse one and let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we pray lord today we've heard the wonderful singing we've heard testimony we've heard lord great things from our youth and we appreciate that father well now it's time that we kind of set everything aside and listen to the word of god just for a little while lord we pray that we have come now and i believe we've we've had an atmosphere set for us by the singing and by the worship and now lord may you come and just flow freely may you have the preeminence in this service lord just not being a bystander but father be the active participant in the service father you take over and you your will be done bless the ones that are sick the ones that are not with us be with the ones lord that are sin sick father save their soul father and raise them up in your in you lord we pray father that you will just be with brother dale as he's doing his sister's funeral there lord that you will just bless him be with him strengthen him keep the family safe lord just ever be with them father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make towards you lord that you would forgive us father you've already done it but we must ask and you're a just father to forgive us bless us and be with us take care of us in the furtherment of this service in jesus name we pray amen all right simon peter a servant apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained light precious faith what we're talking about this morning with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power there's nothing divine except god so it's got to be talking about the power of god divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature so you're going to go into something and partake all right it's good to have a restaurant with some good food right you can read the reviews you can listen to the neighbors you can listen to the people it's been but until you go until you go and partake you don't know what it's about all right it's just hearsay same thing with the divine nature of god it's just hearsay unless you partake of that divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this in other words besides all this divine nature of god giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge into knowledge temperance and the temperance patience and the patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and brother kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence i like that word diligence diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things you shall never fall lord has blessed unto the reading of the word you may be seated then we were talking about this morning there is where that peter's telling us what to do and then now in ephesians 4 verse 11 through 13 paul is telling us how to get it all right and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come to the unity of the faith and to the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ so everybody he's got that i thank them pretty pat and let's go to the first quote that we're going to read i told you we're going to read it every time brother branham said in a statue of a perfect man says notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here i got the very foundation look it's real wide faith is the foundation so it's going to carry you all the way up it's wonderful to have a foundation but you got to build a building on that foundation all right or it just sits there as a foundation and that's not true with god because remember god had a plan and a purpose his plan was was to see a group of people that would come to this full stature all right so somebody's going to do it i i told them last weekend i'm just dumb enough to believe it's me first time all right roll it on up you either have faith or doubt you're either possessed one you're possessed of one that dominates your life you see that dominates all right in other words has the preeminence in your life you either have one that's you have the preeminence of god or preeminence of the devil you can't be in between you've got one or the other all right there's no gray area just depends on how much faith you have how high you can rise everybody agree with that say amen all right so what we're going to do today is is we've come up through faith virtue knowledge temperance if you want to put that chart up that we were that we were doing i i want to i'm not changing the profit right i'm not changing what the profit taught right all right look you know i don't believe i am either but watch we're going to substitute this thank you turn that fire off yeah not too off well you need to sit closer sister game bless your heart she gets cold she gets cold look right here look down here at the bottom it's faith right that's believing but that's your earnest that's your earnest that's your down payment to the full inheritance all right so there's your earnest is down here now then we talked about virtue being strong faith right right discerning faith is the next one knowledge temperance is control faith then enduring faith patience and then respecting faith what respecting the gifts of god in godliness and then common faith is what everything common everything the same god listen there's one thing about god he's consistent you and i forget it but god is consistent so what he said that's the way it's going to be all right then we we got into this this morning and we'll look at it as to me that's the binding this is the holy spirit here is the binding or the welding that welds all this together all right so everybody all right with that is that okay all right and then we see agape love which is the love of god not the love of man has nothing to do listen it has nothing to do with your emotions or your feelings that all right because you remember your emotions and feelings are contrary to god to start with what this is doing is this is what is transforming you by the mind of god coming into you it's transforming you from what from just a human to a superhuman all right from natural to supernatural all right so we got the binding agape love now look see that's your full inheritance you see that and then we have the headstone of the capstone and that's what we're going to talk about today is finish a little bit here with the holy spirit and then get into what we really been wanting to get into now we've been talking before and i want you to realize that all those scriptures that we read it talks about the son of god all right now who is the son of god the son of god is the creator the one that created the world not not not the one two thousand years ago but it's the same person but when you say son of god that's the creator that's why they could look at jesus and say you created all things that was the son of god inside that man creating all things right so that was the creator excuse me but the son of god revelation down through seven church ages only puts you in the body and then it also puts you in service but it never brought the full inheritance amen because remember the earnest or the down payment when you buy a house the earnest is very important it's really the most important it's the first thing you do right but you still have to make payments you still have to make payments until you actually get that title deed in your hand because it's not yours until you do all right it's somebody else's until you do but now remember i'm not going to get into that but remember there's one closer to you than god you have a closer kinsman that's right sorry it's the devil remember boaz and ruth boaz had to go to the nearer kinsmen because remember satan has satan has one strike and it's this thing right here amen but what we're doing with this this is an inside work going outward amen this is all inside it's a secret to me this is the greatest secret that god ever had on the face of the earth outside of jesus christ is that he can live in me and you in satan's eden and have all these things working in our life and us absolutely be sons and daughters of god and the world don't even know we're here the world don't even know we're here and you know what 90 of them don't care but we're the only thing that's holding this thing together you think all the president and all of this and all of that baloney it's all gone people you and i are the reason california is not in the ground you and i are the reason that the bombs haven't already fell on the united states so don't think don't think you're not so important we're the key to this whole thing but it's a secret well you think they're going to put in the paper that when you come to knowledge that oh sister johnny come to knowledge we're gonna put it in the um wherever you live in covington or wherever you live down there they're gonna put it in the paper assistant johnny made it to knowledge no they don't the world don't care the world don't care what we've got to do is though is we've got to come to the full stature of christ and then let him do the work because we're not going to go to the white house and do anything we're not going to go to this place in that place the greatest place to be standing today is like the brother says right here amen right here is the greatest place to be because right here is where you can make a difference he said while i'll go make a yeah you can make a difference out there but the greatest difference is you all right the greatest difference is you god wants to what he wants to bring this alive in a group of people not listen dead people can't help us live their life done and finished right we don't believe in the communion of saints we're not catholic no it says to the sanctified the saints this is what he's talking to live people so you and this is to a live group of people because they're depending on us to get them out of the ground amen they without us cannot be made what perfect because they came up through these church ages they were perfect in their soul you can't have an imperfect soul and be and have god in your soul okay all right but what happens is like we said this morning there was that doors indoors they had a place to wear number one i don't believe it was talk you've got to hear the word you got to hear the word and then let it be quickened in your life you got to hear it so you got to make yourself available for it see because luther luther was born again under justification he could smoke a pipe and drink beer and he's okay but now that justification you can still die and go to hell in this age do you understand that right sure justification is part of your journey amen we believe that this church you go through three stages of justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost to get the new birth amen we don't do away with that brother brown never did away with it and we're not either but god has called us to come higher that if we do smoke a pipe and we do drink a beer we're lost you are lost but god's made provision to come up higher what happened was god moved through luther and the lutherans stopped they put a wall of petition and said you got to do this and do that god moved on through wesley same thing then pentecost and then right on up to you and i and there's nothing else left but us going home and man there's not another church age there's not another messenger there's not another message we've got to get this message right first all right so we come up excuse me we come up to the holy spirit and we read there in ephesians we won't read that one again brother um bob if you want to skip over that one we will go remember we read ephesians 4 let's we stopped right here go go to the next one where it says holy spirit where we stopped at for this morning he's back there he's fell off his chair let's read quote four how about going to quote four can you do that everybody got one of these okay that that's what we're going to be talking about this is a full stature see we read that this morning all right because remember the body is joined fitly together now let's read what brother brown said right here now what does it do then you're waiting for the headstone which is love all right for god is love and he controls and he's the strength of every one of these things that's right yes sir right in here right in here you see i got between all these works in here and here these little waves come what is that the holy ghost coming down through christ see holy spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding this together building a what a perfect church so we can be perfect amen for the capstone to cap it off and like we were talking about this morning this doesn't come down here we what we grow up in god because you see here you know the the funny statement always is you know i'm the head and the neck turns me no the neck can't do anything without the head telling it first you can't turn your head without your brain telling your head to turn all right we made little silly things about your wife being the neck and you'd be in the head and she turned your head but that's kind of that's just silliness but look how would god be though in this drawing how would god be brother dick without that the head and the body can't unite amen so there's got to be a neck there that everything you know everything that happens to your body goes through your neck everything that happens goes right through your neck there's a there's a there's a pipe that goes down and that's called your neck right so that's the same thing with the holy spirit god has to come down through that to make all these things work amen everybody got that say amen so that's the binding that's where everything has to go because you can't think this and it go around and come to your foot now it's got to come down through here through the neck part which is what the binding or the welding part without your neck connected to your body remember you can have your spine severed your brain will work but if your spine severed up here your body's not gonna work because it has to go down through the neck all right so the neck of this whole thing is the holy spirit and it's christ doing what showing what brother branham said now we said today this morning that it was a pull and what it is it's pulling up to fill in this part right here all right because if you bring this down here it won't fit huh you got that got to be the holy spirit filling this in to make that building complete and brother brown and we if we get to it brother brown said there's a flange there's a little piece that fits right over here to shed the water because you know what if there i promise you if there's a hole in your roof and it leaks guess what's going to happen that's where the water's going to come through right everybody's had a leaky roof sometime or another or leaky something and wherever there's a crack wherever there's a gap that's where the water is going to come through all right so that's the same thing in god if we don't have that binding or that welding together as the prophet of god said there in in that fourth part here the glory the power of god coming down through this what welding it together see he's talking about pentecost he's talking about lutherans talking about the wesleyans but there's a genuine part of it now see that doesn't make them wrong martin luther was not wrong martin luther was right the doctrine martin luther priest was correct god god said that's fine but there's more amen but the lutheran said that's fine and we don't need it anymore the lutheran the doctrine the lutheran denomination they stood where they were and they died god moved on all right same thing with you and i we can sit in a message church and just die we can just die if you think this is just something you need to come to church just because if you don't somebody will talk about you number one you are true number two this is where i get my i get filled up right here this is where i get filled up is in right here all right now let's go to paragraph 341 uh roll it up and we'll 341. these fellas wasn't required luther was not required to go into ii peter and preach this right even though he may have read it he may have even had a sermon on it but there was no way he could attain to that because he was under the just shall live by faith but you and i the seals have been open the book has been open all right so we should be able to understand these things the holy ghost christ and the person of the holy ghost this is what we read when we finish this morning comes upon you so there's a this is an anointing this is a feeling everybody okay with that say amen this is a feeling god fills you with his soul his soul fills you with his soul then you grow up through here and then what does he do he anoints that whole thing amen it's an anointing same holy ghost remember there's different anointings same holy ghost but this is a special anointing this anointing brings us from the son of god ministry because remember the son of man is the one that was adopted the son of god don't need adoption he's the creator he's the one that created all things the son of god created all things brother dale's going through it so it's wonderful how they fit together but the son of man is the one that took a body change the son of man is the one that was adopted so we must get into the that's why brother brown had to bring the son of man ministry he had to bring us out of the son of god ministry to bring us into the son of man ministry so we could understand that we're to become the word made flesh the holy ghost christ in the person of the holy ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the holy ghost not that it was false but it's just going to ring more true than it ever has before listen because there's nobody on the face of this earth had it like jesus had it he was the fullness of the godhead bodily right now you and i are not the fullness but all together we are the fullness we weren't on the earth when jesus was here most of us wasn't here when brother branham was here we've all been born after or or come in after so we weren't here he was preaching to a group of people that wasn't even born you're going to understand that one day when brother branham gets up on the seals and he said this is not for you it's gone from you he's telling the people look you're under the son of god dispensation live a good christian life do what you're supposed to do and if he could say it he would he said because you're going to die and go by the grave because you're not getting this but there's a group of people that's coming hallelujah there's a group of people that's not coming that's here that's going to take this thing and sweep it right on up to the coming of the lord because we got to have adopted sons and daughters of god before we get a body change that's why this is important people you can stay right here and you can die all you want to i may fall dead in 15 seconds but somebody's going to reach that right there and death will not have a victory over them the holy ghost christ and the person of the holy ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the holy ghost and you've got all these virtues sealed in you then god lives in the tabernacle called the building the living now he's not talking about a building he's all about a building right not made by hands listen if you're born again you weren't made by hands that's why i said about that seed adam and eve got together and produced a son made by hands made by two people listen you and i are born by the word of god no sex involved it's all right here the way we should have come we're going to talk about it lord if we get to it we're going to talk about because remember adam adam before the fall didn't need redemption now in the mind of god he knew everything's going to happen but remember when adam was in a certain place they were perfect right he was the god of the earth but when it fell when it fell right right for us to go back to where we have we're we're living in human bodies without death we got to come back to here that's right and they really enjoyed daddy brother brother joe greene's cause he'd never seen it like that before remember redemption is not replacement all right so you don't drop this and pick up a pencil but now remember here's what man's done man said okay there is redemption it's fail now i'm going to pick it up and put my idea with it now is that where it started where it started was here that's why it took a profit to type the loose ends man's had it over here man it's called redemption father son holy ghost baptism three gods and all these different things but you've got to bring it back to where it was restore it back to the position remember brother branham said one time he said i remember he talked about the vision about the hat that's right the hat didn't just it wasn't just that the hat was there or in the room it had to be in the right place before anything could happen he said i saw the hat laying there he said but i couldn't do anything about it he said i had to wait till they moved that hat for the vision come on vision god's got a vision he's got a vision of me and you all right stop preaching all right but look that's what we got to come back to right there all right we got to come back to here god lives in a tabernacle called the building the living tabernacle live in god's dwelling place and when a man possesses these kind of things then the holy ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues impersonate any gift that god's got remember brother brown said the third poll will not be impersonated because remember i i don't have the quote but i read it the other day brother brown said the branham tabernacle i think is black feminist names brother brown said the the reason brown tabernacle is not growing he said you've got two kinds of virtue one was just normal virtue and the other one's holy ghost version see you can have a part of these virtues and not be born again but you can't come to right here and have those virtues just be natural born virtues no no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that god has got you might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of faith but when these virtues grow in and you added that to that then you are a living monument you are a living moving idol come on amen a living moving idol you're not one that just stands there that's the statue we've become statues not stature we've become statues even maybe in our christian walk maybe we'd we need to kind of uh shake ourselves a little bit because god doesn't want statues the catholic church has statues no we got a living god we got a god that's got skin on it yes sir amen we got a god that's got skin on it you know the reason i is telling them they're in in north carolina the reason i know that i'm going to live in human flesh i'm going to being a glorified by living human flesh and god himself is going to live in human flesh and he's going to be right there with us it's because adam talked with god before the fall he was in a human body that brother branham would have been said would have been made eternal right had there not been a fall so that's what we got to go back listen redemption is not replacement you got to go back to there all right so we got to what what are we missing in this whole thing we're missing authority we're missing authority all of us we're all missing authority god has given us authority we just haven't reached out and got it yet we just haven't reached out and got it yet that's right well you got to be bold you got you got to know that you're that this thing right that this holy spirit has welded that thing together to when god that when satan does give you that punch your building is not going to crack your building's not going to crack when he gives you that punch and you got to what have what f a i t 8. you got to have faith and you know in god all right now look number five let's read a few of these and then we'll get look let's just read the blue you're a living instrumentality of god god walking on what two feet in you amen glory the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of god god walking in you for ye are written epistles read of all men and if the life that's in christ being you you'll bear the life that christ bore all right let's go to number six blasphemous names brother brown said now these things here absolutely must be look must be in the christian before the holy ghost ever seals them before this comes down on top and makes a white complete unit all right number seven i picked some of these out so we could we could hurry through them i don't want to hurry through them but we're going to have to the holy spirit always speaks of what the word so you're supposed to be all the way up here by that time say bring us into the full stature of sons and daughters of god now we're going to read it in a little while you're a son here you're an heir but you know what you got to possess that you got to you know what if you have a reading of a will you got to be there and you know what you got to do you got to accept it you got to accept that all right let's go to number eight blasphemous names he's talking about mental faith and this is where he was talking about the uh the brown tabernacle because most of your faith is mental faith but it's gotta drop down to be what become a spiritual revelation all right your mental faith right here comes the holy spirit coming down into your mental faith making it a spiritual faith then the spiritual faith only recognizes the word now and number two three then you'll have spiritual you'll be have the holy spirit and will seal all these things into you as that holy spirit covers this from your faith up to the holy spirit now what's he talking about from your faith up to the holy spirit that's what he's talking about right because see when he's preached blasphemous names i'm pretty sure the chart was still up there because he was referring to it okay all right from your faith up to the holy spirit seals you in with christ then you become one right something that god can use right all right let's read paragraph 152 and then they are vindicated in what place that's what we're fixing to talk about you can be vindicated but you're going to have to be placed all right when that time takes place they become vindicated sons and daughters of god amen that's what we want to be we just don't want to be sons and daughters of god we want to be vindicated sons and daughters of god amen and you know what like i said before it doesn't make your head swell if it makes you puffed up then you know who's puffing you up it's not god amen god gives you a revelation truly gives you a revelation first thing you say is why me lord why why me why why did you pick me to do this well you know what he's got to work for you to do accept it accept it that's what i said before if god shows you that you got this kind of holy ghost patience thank god that he had enough confidence in you to give it to you because he knew you would use it right he's not gonna he's not like me and you that that you know i'll give i'll give sister milk or something i'll say well maybe she'll use it maybe she won't no god knows what she's gonna do with it before he even gives it to her all right so the same thing with you and i as we go up this statue of a perfect man what a great confirmation that that can be of you being a son and daughter of god is that what he tries you and i right he tries you remember patience tribulation work is patience so you're going to go through some tribulation i promise you that because tribulation work is patience all right so everybody okay the holy spirit is an anointing on all this it seals you in now sure you're in the body of christ here but right here god is fixing to do something to you that he has done to hardly any people in the world because we're fixing to talk about something that the lord jesus and william branham went through that we know that's vindicated now we know of others but we know of those two that's documented vindicated that they were taken upon a place and god said this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell hear ye him all right see because what happens right down here right down here god says this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell he's pleased to dwell in you at that point but he doesn't say hear ye him because you know what honestly he knows what you're going to say and it may not be right that's what it is we're all a bunch of legalists when we start right we still in the do's and don'ts hey man so now let's go to charity love or the headstone all right let's go to first corinthians 13. now what we're doing is if we know then that only maybe a tenth of a of a percent has ever reached this that we know one thing's for sure once you reach that you're gonna have to have the same the same you've got to have the same anointing that jesus had and brother branham had you've got to have the same revelation boy yeah you've got to have the same revelation brother brother harris i never forgot that years ago he preached on the sword in the hand you've got to have a sword in the hand experience for your own self why because the words go out to fit you it does mean no good that it fit william branham other than i can what draw virtue off of what he preached but still i gotta have it just like he had it exactly there's only one thing between me and brother branham he had a gift he was a prophet i'm not a prophet but i can receive what from a prophet the bible even says if you'll honor a prophet you'll get a what prophet's reward now you and i are going to get a prophet's reward because he was adopted so you and i if you enter into the same place and not say i got it because he got it i got it because the pastor got it i got it because my wife got it no you got to have a sword in the hand experience for your own self god's going to have to take you out somewhere put you out put you up on him put you up on a pedestal him put you up on a pedestal and say that's my son if you're going to get anything from him you're going to have to listen to him he got quiet right we're living way below our privileges brother branham called us little messiah so we're going to read in just a minute how that god has purposed that all that come to pass so charity love the headstone first corinthians 13 verse 1 though i speak with tongue of men and angels and have not what charity that charity is love that's agape love that is not filial love all right i am become as a sounding brass and a tinkling or a tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envious not he's going through the statue of perfect man charity vaulted not itself in other words put yourself up here it's not puffed up so there's your characteristic right there now let's go to first corinthians 13 13 which is a continuation and now a body of faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is charity and above all these things put on charity which is what the bond of perfectness that's the complete stature of a perfect man why do you think enoch when he built the pyramids he didn't put a capstone on it there had to have somebody that was adopted come to preach adoption because you can't be adopted if you're a novice and you can't listen to a novice preach about adoption now i'm not saying anything i definitely i told you where i was at but i got to get through brother kindness first but i can read it to you out of the bible and what the prophet said colossians 3 verse 14. did i miss one colossians 3 14. go back down that way go that way the other way the other way the other way well i might not put it on there that's my fault colossians 3 14 says above all these things put on charity which is the bond i did read that which is the bond well they put that's not first corinthians 14 right there that's colossians see they well it's not their fault really but they take it off of what i give them and they have to reposition it so it they just left that's not that's not first corinthians 3 14. that's not a new doctrine i've not changed the word that's colossians 3 14 says above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness all right now let's go to the greek the word agape agapo cafe either one look love beloved of persons to welcome to entertain to be what fond of to love dearly god loves us but he wants us to be sons and daughters he wants to love us dearly of things to be well pleased to be contended at or with a thing in other words this is my beloved son whom i'm pleased to dwell here you him i'm pleased with what he's saying but i want you to hear what he got to say all right so let's go to the next one that's number 25 and 26 on in the greek lexicon love charity dear charitable feast of charity brotherly love brings it right back down affection good will love benevolence but remember this has nothing to do with your filial love right okay agape love is so much brother brown said so far from easiest to the west right with you the love you have for people here versus agape love all right so we got and we've got to learn that all right now let's go to number nine is that your perfect man listen you get it these people who died in here church ages got it these people who died in here are way depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection amen and they're under souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection that when christ does come and this church you see is coming smaller in the minority in other words it's getting sharper right all right there's a honing part that we're probably not get to right now it's a whole lot sharper than that but just like to write that cross there see the original drawing has brother brown put a cross right here if you ever see the original drawing there's a cross right here that's what he's referring to when he says the cross i just wanted to make that clear because he'd just like to write that cross there see it's the coming up to a needlepoint until the church in the minority so listen not a public show no way it's not going to be a public show if you see anything raise up and it gets popular i want somebody to slap me if i become popular and if i keep like what i'm doing i ain't going to be popular i like it that way until the church in the minority has got to get into a place until it's the same kind of ministry that this left what the headstone because when this headstone comes back see it's got a little pocket here like where it's going to sit right in there on the regular pyramid it just isn't a cap that sits across the top all right there's a flange that fits to keep it from wiggling and to keep what it's a little flange and it's got to sit on there because it sheds what the water and when it comes this church has got to be honed all these rest the stones in the pyramid are laying so perfect so you can't run a razor between them weighing tons laying in there how they got them up they don't know but they were built and up here when the pyramid cap does come the pyramid itself the body of christ will have to be honed not only just some creed or doctrine or something other we come through it'll have to be so perfectly like christ till when he comes he and that ministry will fit right smack together see then we'll come the rapture and the going home amen so we can't be one word off that's why we are so adamant in this church about even one word of false doctrine amen somebody's got to have the perfect word to bring a perfect bride to perfection you cannot bring a perfect bride to perfection without perfect word amen that's just common sense because you know what one word got us from here to here right one word not right one word so you think one word off is going to get us back to here yep got to be a perfect word not a perfect people a perfect word that makes the people perfect amen if you look at it that way not a perfect people has got a perfect word no a perfect word that the people yield their self to and then they become perfect by that but remember i want to be perfect by christ right right that's right not by myself right i want christ to be the one to do it but then will come the rapture the going home so what's the rapture waiting on me and you to bring the same ministry that the head has because remember in our picture a long time ago they rejected this they rejected the son of man ministry when they put him on a cross they said you're not god you're a man making yourself god no he was god made himself a man and when we come back to that to see that now god has made himself a a man hallelujah amen we got to believe it more i hate going to funerals i despise them oh you know well that's that's wonderful if you're a christian that's okay but that's not our call our call is to be here on the earth and to call the ones that have went on out of the grave because remember it wasn't dead people talking to dead people when jesus rose it was live people talking to live people right why seek ye the living among the dead galatians 3 we're not going to get finished unless you'll bear with me about another 45 minutes but before faith came we were kept under the law i love this because this takes you from the new birth to adoption and remember we're going to go through galatians three and four and for those of you that that are not that that are new paul's writing a letter now man put these in verses and chapters but paul when he wrote a letter to the galatians he wrote a letter right right so watch this continuation of a letter but before faith came we were kept under the law remember works we're going to be judged by our words if we're not born again all right that thing is sensitive but before faith came we were kept on i used to like this thing but i don't think i like it anymore shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed so it's gotta be a revelation before the law wherefore the law was our schoolmaster now we talked about this once before but we got to go through it again what was the school master the school master when you were in school was not the teacher remember the old school mom or what we call a principal the principal actually now sometimes they did in the natural but most of the time the principal was the principal he didn't teach class he entrusted that to the school teachers all right but we were under a school master the law was our school masters or what to bring us to christ because it had to tell us we were wrong the law told us we were wrong so it brought us to christ that we might be what justified by faith but after that faith has come we're no longer under a schoolmaster all right the law has been done away with for you are all children of god by faith in christ jesus whereas many of you has been baptized into christ have put on christ there's neither jew or greek there's neither bond or free there's neither male or female for you're all one in christ jesus and if you be christ then what are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise now man broke it right there and put chapter four in forget about that keep going don't put that in there don't even put one too because look now i say he's continuing his thought now i say does everybody understand that saying man if you don't i'll go over it again you understand that galatians come all the way down three all the way down now what we have become in christ not under a schoolmaster anymore but we've come to christ by faith what right here all right but now watch we're not finished now i say that the heir as long as he is a child difference nothing from the servant though he be lord of all right got it right he's got full inheritance but he can't drive a car yet it's under what tutors and governors there's your teachers until what the time appointed of the father right god takes you out and does the right of adoption god is the one that that determines whether your name is good as a checkbook because remember remember power without character you're going to write a bounce check even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world we were babbling babies right but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons amen all right be adopted the only way you can be adopted listen god does not adopt the devil's kids and you know the reason that the reason that benny and brenda didn't go to the funeral today is because what they're not dales i mean sure they would do it by the respect but it's not family when we call a family reunion donnie and susan don't show up right right i mean they could if they wanted to get the point they're not dale's so they don't you know if if something was to happen to brother dale it'd be me and terrence and anna none of you you left out sorry because why you're not a part of the family same way with god he's not going to bestow gifts upon the devil's kids he's not going to adopt the devil's kids he's only going to adopt his family that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying daily daddy that's right have our father's daddy daddy amen wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and what then an heir of god through christ amen so that's what's bringing us up into adoption sure god's pleased to dwell in you absolutely pleased to dwell in you the day you get born again but he doesn't want you to stop there so now let's go to romans 8 14. now i want you to brother dale did this several years ago and i try to do it a lot out out away from here because i believe it's important because most of the time when you say adoption everybody goes adoption they either say one they either say well we're already adopted because we got it when we believe no that's not true because remember you're going to receive the spirit of adoption not adoption i don't have the quote with me but i read it this past sunday brother branham said that's two different things your born-again experience is one thing and your adoption is another but you've got to be born again in order to be in line for adoption you've got to become an heir in other words to get the part of the air that the air gets and we're going to read that so there's two different things a lot of people say well we're in the adoption age because brother branham was here and he well no that was for him at that point amen you got to see it for you amen you've got to see it for you hallelujah okay everybody all right because we're going to go through this and we're going to go through the three stages of adoption and i'll try to get it done in 30 minutes if that's all right that okay most of you are not asleep yet but before you go to the land of nod let me tell you this turn to romans 8 or you can read it here at verse 14. now this is going to take us through the three stages of adoption there's three stages there's birth there's authority and there's understanding three stages of adoption i'm listen we're we're we're out we're out of the son of god dispensation we're in the son of man dismissation all right you remember me preaching one time justification sanctification baptism holy ghost justification sanctification baptism holy ghost justification sanctification baptism and holy ghost you never do get away from those three things right brother brown said there's a mysterious part of justification sure the justification where you were born again where you came in and had your sins forgiven sure but you still had that old nature right but when you come to this justification here he said it's as if you've never done it and he said then the real you never did it if we don't come to that people we're still going to lean back to where that devil says yeah you did it yeah you did it no devil you tricked me into doing it you're a tricker you're a tripper upper hey if you're born again how many times i preached on genesis 1 26 that's your new birth that that part of you never fail right that part of you never had a bad day that part of you never said a bad word that part of you never had a sex relationship you only had a relationship with jesus christ the spirit word of god amen that's why if we don't we got to understand what we already got inside of us what the bible's already said about us and what the prophets already said about us because we got to believe what our prophet said but watch let's take it strictly from romans 8 verse 14. for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god amen for ye have not received the spirit of what bondage again to fear now what happened when when adam we're going to talk about adam in a minute but remember adam and god and eve talk together face to face all the time right there was no fear none brother brown said god would come down and cool the day and say adam how was your day just con conversation like me and you brother issue would have but what's the first thing adam said when they fell oh uh he said adam where art thou he said i was afraid for ye have not received the spirit of bondage that genesis 1 26 man don't fear but you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry daddy daddy right the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god children of god watch this children cry in children children cry and if children then heirs now look people this is not a kid this is not a child but as we grow up we grow up from a child to what to authority the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ whatever he gets we get right are the bibles wrong now did did jesus christ take a body change christ never had to but jesus christ did all right is that okay because he was the son of man the son of man is the only one to take a body chain christ don't need a body change but for your in my sake he came down here and took on a form of flesh so that we can have a body change all right everybody okay with that say amen if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together all right is that true you got your car keys will you drive them home go get in the car and drive them home when we're finished with the service can you do that no hold on yeah there you go but now look he's a human amen he has intelligence he's got eyes he can see he's got ears he's a human why can't he drive a car she's a human she's got eyes on both sides well two of one of them on each side of her nose most of the time mothers have them right here in the middle and right here in the back but why can't he here you better give me that why can't he do that now look when you're born again god doesn't give you this but yet the car's there the car's there for you to drive but you got to get a driver's license in other words what's the difference between benjamin and his mom she's mature and the state of georgia or whatever state you're in says that when you get 16 years old which i don't agree with you're mature enough to drive a car god says the same thing now remember he's the son of her he's in the family why doesn't he get the car keys he's a child child child children child look at all those and if children then heirs now he's an heir to that car but you don't get don't give him the keys until what he has reached a maturity level we all have to come to a place do you remember i remember when i first became born again god would just answer all my prayers i don't know if he did you the same way but but i think when we're all when we come to that baby form of of being born again we do cry daddy daddy daddy daddy now look josh is not here today but i don't want him to call me up every five minutes crying i want him to grow up now there was a time and a point there was an appointed time he was under tutors and governors raised up in the family to what not being taught to cry about everything amen to be a man about things same way with god the way the way i can see adoption is exactly the way you you grow and you raise your children i know we we do a bad job of that but you still have to see that those children are so cute and and they depend on you as parents i don't want them to be 30 years old and depending on me hallelujah parents says amen it says leave your father and mother and cleave to your wife it doesn't say leave your wife and cleave to your parents got that that was just the whitley son i was talking to i tell you what i had a lot of respect for your dad you knew that i mean brother willie ross stood right here many times and preached the word of god a long time ago and they would just fill this church up for when it was like this and just the power of god was with the man and they could sing like you wouldn't believe well you saw that you guys in the whole even the even the in-laws can sing yeah you can even the in-laws can sing i have godly jealousy of that and if children then heirs their heirs their mind and join heirs with christ so they get everything i get if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together so the first part of your adoption is definitely you got to be born again and grow up in god you cannot be adopted without these working in your life and they're sealing you in so forget about it without these brother brown said without these we're a stumbling block to the unbeliever that's what he said i believe it's in blasphemous names he said we become a stumbling block when they see us not acting like a full-fledged christian should act but remember though if we're born again we're still heirs because remember kids act up but as we grow in grace and knowledge you begin to shed that and gain some maturity now let's continue reading so that's your first stage that's the birth for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall what be revealed in jesus name shall be revealed in us so there's a revelation amen as we come down there's a revelation for the earnest expectation of the creature now let's go back let's go back because we got to start we got to talk about authority i'm sorry i'm going to be a little bit long today but just gonna have to bear with it for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god why this was authority right this adam and eve in the garden this was authority i love what brother luis was talking about the other day because he hit the nail on the head adam had full authority of the earth god said look adam i'm going to take care of the heaven i'm going to make sure the stars work and i'm going to make sure the galaxies run because it's kind of big but i'm going to put you on the earth and you're going to be the god of the earth and i'm not going to question what you say because remember adam named all the animals and i like what brother louise said because it makes the point strike more than the way i used to bring it out yeah we learn from each other adam said that's an elephant and god said that's exactly what i was going to say that's what i was thinking all along adam said that's a zebra funny looking horse but it's a zebra god said that's exactly what i was going to call that what the two minds work together that's authority when adam said something god didn't have to go into crisis mode to clean up the mess because remember even at the fall adam knew what he was doing he knew exactly what he was doing he knew he was going to sell the human race out when he did what he did but he couldn't kill her because she was part of him that was the agape love i'm talking about filio love would have said god throw that slot away and get me another one are you're quiet you let your spouse go lay down with the beast would you invite her right back in come on people that's why it was agape love adam looked past every bit of that and he said god she's mine she's me and that's what jesus christ on the cross he looked down and he said there me god forgive them of their sins for i reckon that the suffering of this present time was not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god so what fell man fell first right who fell underneath all creation fell under the man because he was the highest form of creation everything fell underneath for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly that's why after a while the lion wanted to eat adam he sold them all out but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope in other words it's coming right back up through man again because the creature itself also now what watch if you've got a scofield bible that creature is translated to creation the whole creation groaneth in waiteth we'll we read it for the creature was made subjects abandoned not willing but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption now let's translate that we must do that first right that's right because remember we fell first and everything fell below us well if we're going to restore it back we've got to come back to where it fell then everything's going to come up to it because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travails and pained together until now until now until now you and i there's the second stage we must come back to where we have authority first over one nature yours yours you got to have control over your nature before you can control that nature out here amen and that's what this is this is a nature change you're having your nature change you're growing in god and god's going to come up there one day and say look you've come to a place to where an act of restoration has happened and you know what i didn't want you to say much when you first got born again because he's a kid babbling babies that's right but when you come to the authority stage where your name is just as good on the checkbook as your father's then what's going to stop what you say him backing it up see we haven't come to that yet altogether i said all together we haven't there's a lot of things that we could say about that that happened even here at the church with with brother coley's gun being called back several things brother harris several things has happened but listen god wants it to fire like fireworks he wants everybody to come in to where he can say i trust what you say right because what happened with brother branham you see in brother branham's life we know he came to adoption amen because the word couldn't have been unfolded any further had he not been adopted because up here is where you got the son of man ministry which is the seals and all the full opening of the word everybody understand that amen amen amen all right so that's where he came to the full adoption where brother where god said hear ye him you're going to hear it you're going to get it from him well now you know what that's the same thing's going to happen to you and i because remember thus saith the lord is good but the bible says you say to this mountain thus saith the lord is saying what the lord said oh we you you're going too far no we ain't got far enough this body is going to be changed by what you speak your body changed you're going to speak brother dale cannot speak your body change right you're going to have to speak your own body change so guess what if he's got authority that's fine but i'm going to have to have authority amen thank you lord i hope that's great i do too cause they had a cloud in the sky where was i for we know that the whole creation growth is revealed in pain until now now with brother branham you can tell several things happened in his life if you remember one time when remember he came up there and he came up to that storm or he went up on top of the mountain and he what he's he he didn't say thus saith the lord's storm go out of existence did he the lord jesus told him said you speak it right and he did he said storm he even told the storm what to do he said storm leave and said and it's going to be you know we're going to have sunshine for four days and he just kept telling nature what to do all right so that's where you and i but remember god didn't sit up there going no no no no don't say it no don't say that don't say that no he was pleased with what that man said he came and backed up what he said because he had come to a position that you and i must come to because remember after that happened he comes down off the mountain if you remember god said come and walk with me so he was walking adam is that what he said and the way he said i didn't bring a quote but i'm gonna get close he said come walk with me now what was that and then what did they come across they come across the two deer they come across two deer now most of us are deer hunters and we can't get that close to deer especially he said after they've been shot at so many times but he said those deer were so close he could touch him with his rifle barrel that would probably be closer than me and brother al okay and said they looked at him and there was no fear if you could just think about what those animals were thinking because nature feels god sometimes before we do but those two deer i'll guarantee you if you could get inside their brain they were looking at that man they said adam is that you adam are you back in power because we're groaning we're groaning and travailing in pain together until now waiting on me and you to come to a place brother brown said that bull had such a bewildered look on his face why because that bull's nature was to kill the human but that bull was he felt an anointing he never felt before what about you and i he said oh that was for a prophet i disagree with him right because he's gone on and now we've got to get him out of the grave by what he said nothing else but by what he said i believe that with all my heart i believe that's right but he gave us provision before he left and it's lying he said in the books and tapes not on them that's a problem sometimes we read on the books we don't read in the book amen and not only they not finished yet this is authority we got to come back to authority and not only they who nature but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves right they got to feel the pull from us waiting for the adoption to wit now that word to it means to understand the redemption of our body now for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not that's hope if your kids are already sitting here saving the saints to find filled with the holy ghost why are you hoping they're coming they're here so that's the same thing with this we we we hope for these but what about when we don't have to hope when we see it for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for that's right but if we hope for that which we see not then do we with patience wait for it second stage of adoption is authority third stage is to understand the redemption of the body amen you say no that's the body changed now brother brown didn't go through a body changes he was adopted but we got to understand that this is the age for adoption this is the age for the body change and if we don't take a body change we're going to take a body change that's for sure it's going to go to the undertaker and they're going to take your blood out and all that other stuff yeah he's going to be a change all right but there's got to be somebody church amen that's got to come through this every one of these stages birth authority understand the redemption of the body what's the last enemy to be destroyed death that's the whole thing that we look for is that death death is the big thing that we don't know anything about but brother branham came went across the curtain of time come back across and he said why should you fear death why should you fear death when death is the vehicle that takes you right into the presence of god but listen death must be destroyed in us death must be destroyed so we got to understand the redemption of our body we got to understand that death sure is a vehicle to take some to the grave and take them right on into christ but there's going to be a group of people that's going to have stand on this earth and going to have to say death where's your sting grave where is your victory now let me finish with this and i may have told you before but i'm going to tell you again because you probably already forgot it if death is our big oh death is that you know it's that big oops you know you don't know what you don't know what it is but let's look at it like this and i've i've told it many times to others before and i think it kind of sticks home because we always do the uh we always talk about david and goliath you know you've heard since she's a little boy about david and goliath david and goliath david bender picking up five stones and him throwing it at the giant and the giant is this and the giant stack things you got to overcome well let's back on up just a little bit because there we've been talking about a special anointing right everybody wake up just for a minute listen we've been talking about a special anointing right all right so what did samuel now samuel was the prophet of the hour let's go back in the old testament samuel was the prophet of the hour he was the one that god talked to and talked through right all right he was the prophet of the day now samuel god tells samuel says samuel you need to go find israel a king samuel gets the anointing oil and by leading of the holy spirit he comes up to jesse's house he knocks on the door and jesse says come in samuel says i'm here for one purpose remember he didn't talk too much he said where are your sons stood them out there all in front of him samuel looked at the first church age second church age no third fourth fifth sixth all the way down samuel says there's a problem here somewhere because i've been sent here to anoint a king right and this all your sons oh i got one more he's a shepherd he's out in the field he's taking he's in other words he had a job i hadn't thought of that for now he had a job the other ones didn't but you remember the other ones didn't have a job they weren't called to adoption they weren't called to a body change so samuel takes the oil and he says something's wrong there's got to be another one he said i got one more remember because he was in the house it had to be the household of jesse had to be an heir i'm going somewhere with this just pay attention so david comes up and samuel says that's the man the anointing was the same so he takes the oil and he pours it on david anoints him to be king of israel several years later several years later 50 something years later david goes and visits his brothers he was a young boy when he was anointed he had to grow up but remember samuel anointed him to be king he had to grow up so he goes to the battleground and he talks to his brothers and he hears in the background a voice he said why are all you why are all you scared of this guy named death right because if you fought with that guy that philistine you gonna die without some kind of special anointing you're gonna die he was like 14 feet tall and i mean he was just way bigger than anybody that we know around here today right so you were gonna die but david had no problem with that he said why are you letting this uncircumcised philistine that's right exactly defy the army of god are the children of god children of god but the whole point of this is david didn't just have faith in david right 50 years ago there was a prophet come on the land and he had an anointing oil and he anointed me to be a king and you think i'm going to let that get in my way he believed what his prophet said and he says and david said you know what until i sit on the throne i'm invincible i'm not gonna die till i sit on that throne if i believe what my prophet said if i believe that that special anointing was poured on me in my age amen revelations 5 says you're going to be white kings and priests if you ever see that people death will not harm you david wasn't only it wasn't all just him he believed what that man said he believed what them 1150 sermons said he believed he was the prophet he believed what he said and he said hey i'm invincible so death where's your sting grave where's your victory we have all things through christ who strengthens me be of david be a david fight your way through now look david didn't just walk up there and and goliath look at him and go no goliath stood there until he about that far from that thing hitting him in the face right until he got that real warm feeling between his eyes he still thought he could defeat david he thought david he said i'll just take my spear and i'll feed you to the what feed you to the to the birds but about that far when he saw that rock about right here he knew he had a problem but remember david prophesied he said today i'll take your head off and he did it with whose sword he did it with his enemy sword he picked that big thing up and he whacked that thing's head off and guess what he became a king because he believed what his prophet said let's stand one more quote this is the last one i'll leave you with this one brother brown i'm saying the statue of a perfect man 1966 62 and i want you to take it and study it and compare it and then act upon it don't just study it compare it but act upon when you act upon it when you do take it sincerely to yourself don't say well i enjoyed listening at it i did too but to listen at it and then receiving it is different see it's different that's my commission to you do not just listen and say i enjoyed that i want us to act on it i want us all to come to a place that we come to right there and then god can say whatever you say i'll back it up because you know what when we take a body change who you know we can sit there and say it all day brother dick my body's changing my body's change but one day when you say my body's changed god's gonna say that's exactly what i was thinking got to bring it together because remember somewhere he's eternal he's already said it he knows who's going to come to it but we don't so like i said i'm just dumb enough to believe it's me right don't call me dumb i'm just dumb enough to believe thank god for these people that can play and look at these people here these brothers that can they can sing but listen god's got a bride he's got a david that'll believe what that prophet said know that that special anointing is on him now it doesn't make you a special person it's a special anointing on the person if you think you're a special person you'll never get this special anointing but if you get the special anointing god's going to do what he's going to manifest through you what he's always wanted because the whole world is waiting on the manifestation of sons and daughters that's right of god let's sing a song thank you for listening to this um statue of a perfect man i've really enjoyed it you could expound on it more but you know what may the holy spirit fill in all the gaps may the god of glory fill in all the gaps that i left and and excuse me if i left anything out but uh i brought it to you the best i can i know how and i hope we all come to that place less thing yes sir thank you you thank god you thank god heavenly father saying heavenly father i appreciate you if you have a need heavenly father i appreciate you i love you heavenly father i appreciate you holy spirit you heavenly father i appreciate you i love you heavenly father i appreciate you we ask you now that you give her what she needs just bless her lord touch her from the top of her head to the soul of her feet in jesus name we pray amen thank you you love him let's raise our hands oh heavenly father in jesus name we pray amen holy spirit heavenly father i appreciate you i love you i bow down before we know that brother dale's going to have surgery or not surgery but he's going to have some procedures done to his heart so brother al is i'm agreeing with him let's just all gather around around the pulpit around here everybody come here much all everybody sisters brothers children i don't care whoever you are just come on over here everybody all the way from the back to the front whether it's my natural daddy or not he's my spiritual father in the gospel he's all of our spiritual god father in the gospel and i'll absolutely remind you of one thing that the toil that it takes on a man's heart and body because remember we all still live come on up here come on get up here as far as you can come on um up here's where the fire falls amen but he's give his life for all of us he would give his physical life for all of us that's true and remember we're still under the curse our body god can take care of every bit of us but until we come to a place of the body change i'm talking about we're going to get older we're going to have aches and pains our heart's going to run out or all these things are going to happen to us so we still live under the curse but we know a god that's made all this body and he can change things but if you remember jesus he looked 50 years old when he was 30. you look at brother brown and brother i'm 55. brother branham was 56 when he got killed he looked about 70 because of what the toil and stress on his body because of what he gave he literally gave his life so that we can have this message and brother dale is almost literally give his life so he can bring the message to us pure and adulterated i don't know anybody else that has they surely are but i don't know anybody else so we're going to bind right now together as a church family yes sir and he got a prayer cloth this morning but we're going to say a special prayer that god would just touch him like he said let the people do what they want to do but hey it's just lying vanity but we're going to pray that god will anoint him on tuesday when he goes and that all things will be well listen he has been ordained to lead us through and until god's finished with him he's going to but you know what god knew we'd do this god didn't god didn't god it's not a surprise that what brother al said god knew we would bind together from before the foundation of the world he knew we'd do this now the devil may be surprised but that's okay that's a good thing that's right because he i don't care if he gets surprised don't bother me but god didn't know that i mean god knew that yeah brother sam's paid prayed for every one of us even before some of you were born he prayed for your parents so let's pray for him and pray not just a simple prayer pray in earnest prayer talk to god just like just like i said just like he's your daddy he is your daddy daddy daddy you know what let's drop down be children let's let's drop down be children but let's be adults in our heart to ask god so let's all bow our heads pray in your own way and when you're finished we'll be dismissed all right dear heavenly father in the name of
