[0:15] that's right
[0:18] I know we all know why we're here and
[0:20] this is special time for me and this
[0:21] should be my first one so that's this
[0:24] stuff
[0:27] it's just the right time right play
[0:30] that's it right time roughly
[0:32] if you wanna y'all know you don't have
[0:34] your Bible because you turn chapter six
[0:36] of six of Romans
[0:38] Paul is
[0:40] explaining
[0:42] what Jesus was telling the people when
[0:44] he said be baptized
[0:47] this is what I believe because what he
[0:48] says here watch this he says what shall
[0:50] we say then shall we continue in sin
[0:52] that Grace May abound in other words why
[0:54] are we continuing on in this
[0:57] saying that we're that we're doing
[1:00] he said God forbid
[1:03] in other words let's do something about
[1:04] it
[1:05] and that's what we're doing brother
[1:07] Chris is finally he's doing something
[1:08] about it amen we all come to a point
[1:11] like I said today we come to a point to
[1:12] where the word
[1:13] was lit in her heart
[1:15] and we started enjoying the things of
[1:18] God instead of the things of the world
[1:20] God forbid how shall we
[1:22] that are dead to sin live any longer
[1:24] therein in other words how shall we that
[1:27] are dead to sin
[1:29] live any longer therein
[1:32] first thing I want to do get in the
[1:34] water get baptized I wanted a new name
[1:36] they'll talk about a new name we're
[1:38] fixing to give brother Chris a new name
[1:39] right he's going to be the Lord Jesus
[1:41] Christ that's right can we believe that
[1:43] right that's what he's going to be we
[1:45] baptized our brother Chris in the name
[1:47] keep taking on your name right we're
[1:50] gonna have a burial here today we're
[1:52] gonna put somebody
[1:54] to death
[1:55] know you not that so many of us were
[1:57] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[1:59] into his death he's still asking the
[2:01] question therefore we are buried with
[2:03] him by baptism into death that like his
[2:06] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[2:08] the glory of the father even so we also
[2:10] should walk in newness of life
[2:13] or if we have been planted together in
[2:15] the likeness of his death
[2:19] go down planted we're going to plant him
[2:22] all right and once you're going to come
[2:24] back up as not the same dead person
[2:25] right but what but we shall be also in
[2:29] the likeness of his resurrection
[2:32] knowing this that our old man is
[2:35] crucified with him that the body of sin
[2:37] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[2:40] should not serve sin for he that is dead
[2:43] is free from sin
[2:45] if your old husband's dead you marry
[2:48] again
[2:49] but your husband's got to be dead you
[2:51] can't just divorce him
[2:52] you put a lot of we put like we said we
[2:54] put a lot of like take a lot of dry
[2:56] centers and just make them wet Center
[2:57] what'd they do they just hung they just
[3:00] hung their ideas up in a closet
[3:02] somewhere
[3:03] but if there's a real killing if there's
[3:04] a real death
[3:06] then we marry again that's who we're
[3:07] married we're married to Christ is that
[3:09] correct
[3:09] now if we be dead with Christ we believe
[3:12] that we shall also live with him
[3:14] knowing that Christ's being raised from
[3:16] the dead dies no more
[3:18] death has no more dominion over him what
[3:21] was I saying today she is him so we need
[3:23] to read the scripture for us
[3:25] all right
[3:26] death had no more dominion over him for
[3:29] in that he died he died unto sin once
[3:32] we don't have to every time we stand we
[3:34] don't have to go be baptized we're not
[3:35] Roman Catholics we don't have to pay
[3:36] tenants if there's a real death today
[3:40] we won't have to bury brother Chris
[3:41] again right right he buried once Jesus
[3:45] Christ died once wrong all right
[3:47] so now likewise reckon we also
[3:51] we also that we also yourselves to be
[3:55] dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God
[3:58] through Jesus Christ
[4:00] our Lord amen
[4:02] that's the scripture
[4:04] death burial Resurrection
[4:08] the newness of life not be dead again we
[4:11] didn't come back we're not we're not
[4:13] going this far to die
[4:15] again
[4:17] you die one time you're dead let's don't
[4:19] resurrect the old people again the old
[4:22] you the one we're talking about today
[4:23] let's let's when we put when we put him
[4:25] in the ground he's not going to die
[4:27] physically
[4:29] but you know what it's better to die
[4:30] spiritually
[4:31] and come up in the newness of life right
[4:34] than to really be dead naturally
[4:37] because if you're dead spiritual you'd
[4:39] be walking around alive remember the
[4:40] Bible says why is a woman dead while she
[4:42] living
[4:43] she's had other husbands she's done
[4:45] things wrong she's she's well she's
[4:47] alive she's dead so let's don't be that
[4:49] way and a woman's a time for giving out
[4:51] of the church right
[4:52] but if she's divorced she can't married
[4:55] but now she's if her husband's dead she
[4:57] can marry again and we're him
[5:00] and guess what we're going to take our
[5:01] brother
[5:02] we're going to baptize him in the name
[5:03] of Lord Jesus Christ
[5:05] and we're going to bring him up
[5:08] a new man man you may not see it right
[5:11] off when he comes up he's just gonna
[5:13] look a little wet
[5:16] but Betty when I come up out of that
[5:17] water it was like I had everything when
[5:20] I come up it just emptied all out
[5:23] and I became a new creature a new
[5:25] creation God's gonna do a creation here
[5:27] that's why I said if you're baptize in
[5:29] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you
[5:31] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[5:33] right let's don't just take that script
[5:35] and say well now we went to board of
[5:37] baptism now let's go now they're
[5:38] combined they're together I think
[5:40] they're together right that's scriptures
