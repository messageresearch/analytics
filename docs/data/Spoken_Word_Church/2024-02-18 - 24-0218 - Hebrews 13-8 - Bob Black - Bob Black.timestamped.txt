[0:00] all these things in life that you go
[0:01] through that when you prayer when you go
[0:04] to in prayer that there's a God that
[0:06] answers back we're not just worshiping
[0:08] in vain that we're not just coming to a
[0:10] building to warm the seats and so forth
[0:12] but there's a god that actually is is is
[0:15] alive and on the scene and he's not just
[0:18] a historical God but he's the same God
[0:21] that he was back then he's still the
[0:24] same God now we've got the videos and
[0:26] the pictures of things that that
[0:28] Supernatural lights that
[0:30] you know that that were expressed in
[0:32] brother bram's life and whatnot but yet
[0:33] that same Pillar of Fire if you go
[0:35] really study it out that same Pillar of
[0:37] Fire is with the bride today it's not
[0:39] just on the wall it's it's actually here
[0:42] in the building because he's still the
[0:44] same yesterday today and forever so you
[0:46] see as that just flows right in from
[0:48] remember them which have the rule over
[0:50] you and we studied it out it's not just
[0:51] a man telling you what to do or how to
[0:54] dress yourself or how to clothe yourself
[0:56] and how to cut whether to cut your hair
[0:58] not cut your hair and all those things
[0:59] but it's the word of God that's claiming
[1:01] your life that when it grabs a hold of
[1:03] you it's doing something in you and it's
[1:05] causing you to react to that to that
[1:08] unseen Force the the the god of the
[1:10] universe that he's actually having an
[1:12] effect on you and you start believing
[1:14] him you believe him and when you believe
[1:17] him something happens now there's
[1:20] there's when you really you really begin
[1:22] to understand that he's the same
[1:24] yesterday today and forever when you
[1:26] know that there's a God that's going to
[1:28] answer back when you pray you you're
[1:30] believing not just Ju Just just throwing
[1:33] your words out when you when you get on
[1:35] your knees and pray but you believe that
[1:37] God is going to hear your prayer and
[1:39] answer back now that ties in with uh
[1:43] with Matthew 24:35 that says Heaven and
[1:45] Earth shall pass away but my word shall
[1:47] not pass
[1:48] away that means all the Earth might
[1:52] Rumble in an earthquake and and fall to
[1:54] the ground God might take everything
[1:56] away from you like job did and and but
[1:59] yet uh like I love that scripture in job
[2:01] will Satan said will will job serve me
[2:04] for not and the answer is yes yes I will
[2:07] serve God if everything's taken away
[2:10] that's right you you can say that same
[2:11] confession like job did I'll serve him
[2:13] if I don't have nothing cuz listen when
[2:15] everything's taken away when all of
[2:17] Heaven every no no more Heaven and Earth
[2:19] if it was all passed away God's words
[2:22] will never pass away now that's see
[2:25] that's having confidence that he's the
[2:27] same yesterday today and forever that
[2:31] we're believing in an unchanging God
[2:33] that's still present today so now
[2:36] brother Brandon when he explained that
[2:38] scripture that I just read Heaven and
[2:39] Earth shall pass away but my word shall
[2:40] not pass away he he used the example in
[2:43] in that message uh why it had to be
[2:45] Shepherds of Moses there with the
[2:47] serpent that he threw down in front of
[2:48] pharaoh the the staff that he uh tossed
[2:51] down in front of pharaoh let's just read
[2:53] that story real quick in Exodus 7:8 it
[2:56] says and the Lord spake unto Moses and
[2:59] unto Aaron saying when Pharaoh shall
[3:01] speak unto you saying show a miracle for
[3:04] you then Thou shalt say unto Aaron take
[3:07] thy rod and cast it before pharaoh and
[3:10] it shall become a serpent and Moses and
[3:13] Aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did
[3:15] so as the Lord had commanded and Aaron
[3:18] cast down his Rod before pharaoh and
[3:20] before his servants and it became a
[3:22] serpent then Pharaoh also caused the
[3:25] wise men and the sorcerers Now The
[3:27] Magicians of Egypt they also did in like
[3:30] manner with their enchantments well they
[3:32] cast down every man his rod and they
[3:34] became serpents but Aaron's Rod
[3:37] swallowed up their rod their rods now I
[3:41] I I grabbed that little screenshot of
[3:43] the the scene from that Ten Commandments
[3:45] movie of the of them of them acting this
[3:47] out now you think about though that
[3:49] they're acting out they're acting out a
[3:51] story that you and I are going to live
[3:53] through you you find out as you go
[3:55] through life that these stories become
[3:56] real because I'm I'm living through that
[3:59] you know you're going through it you
[4:01] look you can look back and be reminded
[4:02] of these things and oh think about
[4:05] what's happening now that that Moses
[4:07] he's he's God told him what to do right
[4:09] Aaron throws down his rod and and then
[4:12] then something unexpected happens what
[4:15] here come some fakers and they throw
[4:17] down their rods too and it looks like
[4:20] they're doing the same thing now
[4:23] what now there's the question now what
[4:26] are you going to believe that he's the
[4:29] same yesterday today and forever are you
[4:31] going to try to put your hand in it and
[4:33] force the issue try to do something try
[4:35] to come up with your own way of doing it
[4:37] are you going to step back and let God
[4:41] go to
[4:42] work now they th here's the two the two
[4:45] uh Janice and jambers throwing theirs
[4:48] down put yourself in MO in Moses and
[4:51] Aaron's shoes if you were in their spot
[4:54] what would you do would you
[4:56] panic maybe maybe you're going through a
[4:58] situation in life right now what are you
[4:59] going going to do Panic is God's word
[5:02] true is he the same yesterday today and
[5:05] forever that's what it means that's what
[5:07] I'm talking about he's the same he's
[5:08] still the same it doesn't matter if if
[5:10] the devil throws something unexpected in
[5:12] your path something unexpected happens
[5:16] sit back and wait amen faith is what I'm
[5:19] talking about remember them that have
[5:21] the rule over you because they give you
[5:23] the word to build up your faith to
[5:25] believe that he's the same yesterday
[5:27] today and forever so when something like
[5:29] this happens you can stand in confidence
[5:31] believing amen that God is still on the
[5:35] scene now think about all the things
[5:37] Moses could have done Moses and Aaron
[5:39] could have reached out and grabbed the
[5:40] other
[5:40] snakes I'm impatient I'm I guess we're
[5:43] going to have to do this another way
[5:45] reach out and grab this grab the snake
[5:47] and let's let's try to picked up Aaron
[5:49] staff they could have tried to
[5:51] prematurely tried to negotiate with Pho
[5:54] through their natural abilities or
[5:55] persuasion well if God won't come on the
[5:57] scene I'm just going to have to try to
[5:59] use my my natural wisdom and try to just
[6:01] try I'm going try to have to talk him
[6:03] into it sought out other ways to
[6:05] convince the Israelites of their mission
[6:08] or to pressure Pharaoh into letting the
[6:09] Israelites go they could have tried to
[6:13] act independently of God's will which
[6:15] would have threatened their Divine favor
[6:17] with God now see as Christians we're
[6:20] relying totally on God where God is our
[6:25] everything you you go back through all
[6:26] these stories in the Old Testament and
[6:28] the New Testament and it's not by
[6:30] anything that man does it's not by your
[6:31] own works of righteousness it's not by
[6:33] anything that you do it's uh we'll find
[6:36] out even in a minute when you're trying
[6:37] to talk to your children to witness to
[6:39] them it's not really anything that you
[6:40] do can do you're you're totally relying
[6:43] on your faith in God to go to work right
[6:47] when you step back like Moses and Aaron
[6:50] did and say well God you're going to
[6:53] have to do something right cuz I can't
[6:55] do it and then that's when you see God
[6:58] go to work
[7:00] when you when you don't have nothing to
[7:01] do in it then you can have confidence
[7:04] that it is God that God is doing
[7:06] something am they could have impatiently
[7:08] acted on their own which would have
[7:11] undermined their leadership then would
[7:12] all the all the Israelites would have
[7:14] been what's going on you said you said
[7:17] such and such and it didn't come to pass
[7:19] and you jumped the
[7:21] gun and had Aaron and Moses not waited
[7:24] for God to move their mission could have
[7:28] faced premature faith
[7:30] due to a lack of divine endorsement
[7:32] miraculous signs and the authority they
[7:36] needed to lead the Israelites out of out
[7:38] of Egypt but they waited yes they just
[7:42] waited amen just sit back and wait on
[7:45] God now there's a lesson no matter what
[7:48] situation we're in you come to you come
[7:50] to a place where and that's what the
[7:51] whole Christian journey is self
[7:54] sacrifice you'll find out you know even
[7:57] Jesus said that that Judas he he thought
[7:59] that Jesus could get himself out of that
[8:01] predicament right he he sold Jesus for
[8:04] 30 pieces of silver and he thought that
[8:06] well Jesus he's extricated himself out
[8:08] of these predicaments before he'll get
[8:10] himself out of this one but he didn't
[8:12] realize that Jesus was going to die
[8:16] death self- sacrifice is the it's like
[8:19] the the essence of the Christian Journey
[8:21] that's where Peter got hung up when when
[8:24] when uh when Jesus was talking to him
[8:26] and he said Peter Peter was arguing with
[8:28] him about going to the cross and and
[8:30] Jesus said uh get thee behind me Satan
[8:33] because he was speaking contrary
[8:35] contrary to the will of God which was to
[8:38] die and and you and I have to die too
[8:40] we've got to die to our own will that's
[8:43] what that's really what prayer is when
[8:45] you get along with God and you're laying
[8:47] yourself down on the altar of sacrifice
[8:49] and you're saying God not my will just
[8:51] like in the Garden of Gethsemane where
[8:52] Jesus was saying father not my will not
[8:55] my will but thine be done you're laying
[8:58] everything down and saying God you you
[9:00] got to take control you got to work
[9:02] things out I I it's past my ability it's
[9:04] past my understanding you've got to move
[9:06] on the scene just like Moses and Aaron
[9:09] now there there's the there's the
[9:12] essence of he's the same yesterday today
[9:16] and forever I I want to ask you maybe
[9:18] this morning do do you do you believe
[9:20] that do you I mean this not just
[9:22] something that we quote but when you go
[9:24] out of this building today are you going
[9:26] to are these words going to really echo
[9:27] in your heart that when you come into
[9:29] situation like Moses and Aaron are are
[9:31] are are here getting confronted with
[9:34] with with the devil's reaction what are
[9:36] you going to do are you going to believe
[9:39] what God Said or are you going to put
[9:41] your own will to it are you going to put
[9:42] your hand to it try to try to try to
[9:45] solve the situation yourself or trust in
[9:48] a living
[9:49] God and why it had to be Shepherd
[9:51] brother BR said that staff itself had
[9:53] turned into a serpent before pharaoh and
[9:55] the same Pharaoh tried to mimic by
[9:58] magicians and so does the modern
[10:00] pharaohs of today amen and make
[10:02] Believers carnal impersonators of the
[10:05] message try to mimic the same thing
[10:07] without knowing where it's coming from
[10:10] and throw it into some denomination or
[10:12] something when it's as free from it as
[10:14] the air is from being pinned up sure but
[10:17] try to mimic make a mimic but notice
[10:21] this same Shepherd staff eat up the
[10:23] other snakes where was them snakes said
[10:26] they were rods on the floor and there
[10:28] was only only one rod picked up both
[10:31] heavens and earth shall pass away said
[10:33] Jesus but my word shall not that
[10:37] something to think about you you
[10:38] whatever your problem is if you trust in
[10:41] God you'll find out like like Moses and
[10:43] Aaron did the problems were gone when
[10:46] they picked that that Rod up they were
[10:48] gone because they trusted in God they
[10:51] got swallowed up in Victory because his
[10:53] word will not fail he's he's still the
[10:55] same am he's still the same that he
[10:57] always was now now now let's think about
[11:00] that theme as we're going through the
[11:01] scripture that it's not us it's not our
[11:03] own abilities it's not our ability to
[11:05] kind of to and exodus 14:14 it says the
[11:08] Lord shall fight for you yes and you
[11:11] shall hold your peace amen it's the Lord
[11:14] now there's the Christ a Christian way
[11:16] is to step back and step back and
[11:18] believe and watch God do it watch God go
[11:22] to work amen I and I I love to watch God
[11:25] go to work there's so many times you so
[11:28] I could I could start going through all
[11:29] the experiences in my life and it sound
[11:30] like I'm being boastful but I've seen
[11:32] God work so many times when you get you
[11:35] get down in your prayer closet and you
[11:37] you see maybe your kids doing something
[11:39] they shouldn't get down and the next
[11:41] morning the situation will be changed
[11:43] because and you didn't have nothing to
[11:44] do with it your hands are off of it but
[11:47] God came God went to work and began to
[11:49] move and something happened and why
[11:51] because he's still the same he's still
[11:54] the same that he always was now look I
[11:56] know this is really hard to read but I'm
[11:57] just going to quickly relat some of
[11:59] these stories Moses and The Parting of
[12:01] the Red Sea how's Moses going to part
[12:04] the Red Sea they just him and the
[12:06] Israelites watched as God parted it the
[12:08] fall of Jericho they just marched around
[12:10] they marched around and and shouted at
[12:12] the end of the of of the March but but
[12:14] it was God that caused the walls to come
[12:16] down and Joshua and the versus the
[12:19] amalekites when they held up moses'
[12:21] hands as long as they held up moses'
[12:23] hand what what why should that have an
[12:25] impact on the victory am because Christ
[12:27] his hands were held up on the cross and
[12:29] he died for us he he's the one that paid
[12:31] the price on the cross and Moses there
[12:33] was EXA typifying what Christ would one
[12:35] day do for us on the cross as his hands
[12:38] were held up it see it's not us it's God
[12:40] it's our trust in God to fight the
[12:43] battle when sarib came up again against
[12:45] Hezekiah and and an angel came and and
[12:48] and went down into the camp and defeated
[12:50] all the Assyrians and Hezekiah didn't
[12:52] have nothing to do with it all they did
[12:55] to think that's what the Christian
[12:56] journey is to just watch and sit back
[12:59] and watch and see God go to battle for
[13:01] you what a joy that should be in our
[13:03] lives to have confidence in a living
[13:06] reality of a God that could go to battle
[13:08] for you and you ain't got to do nothing
[13:09] but just have faith in him jehoshaphat's
[13:12] B Victory when when Jehosaphat was told
[13:15] by a prophet of the Lord that the battle
[13:17] was not theirs but it was God's all they
[13:20] had to do was take up their position
[13:22] stand seal and to see the Deliverance
[13:24] the Lord would give him Peter when he
[13:25] got up out of prison the gates opened by
[13:28] themselves and all what what were they
[13:30] doing at home praying they were in their
[13:32] prayer closet praying and sacrificing
[13:34] their will to God and saying Lord we
[13:35] believe you and God went on the scene
[13:37] and and and and wrought a victory for
[13:39] them and all they had to do was believe
[13:41] the fiery furnace when Shadrach mesach
[13:43] and Abednego were thrown in there and
[13:46] they just had confidence that God would
[13:47] come on the scene and he did and Gideon
[13:50] against the midianites Gideon with 300
[13:53] men 300 men and all he did was just have
[13:57] trust in God
[13:59] and Daniel in the Lion's Den you see
[14:02] because it's it's not it's not by our
[14:04] power it's not by our might but it's the
[14:07] spirit of the Lord that wins the
[14:10] battle that's that scripture in
[14:12] Zechariah 4 you I I put this picture
[14:14] just so we can visualize what Zachariah
[14:16] is saying here when he said an angel
[14:19] come and woke him up and he said and
[14:21] said unto me what seest thou and I said
[14:24] I have looked and behold a Candlestick
[14:26] all of gold hm that sounds familiar with
[14:30] a bowl upon the top of it and his seven
[14:32] lamps there on and seven pipes to the
[14:35] seven lamps which are upon the top
[14:37] thereof at two olive trees by it one
[14:40] upon the right side of the bowl and the
[14:42] other upon the left side thereof which
[14:44] brother Brown said meant represent the
[14:45] Old and New Testament so I answered and
[14:48] spake to the angel that talked with me
[14:50] saying what are these my Lord then the
[14:53] angel that talked with me answered and
[14:54] said unto me knowest thou not what these
[14:56] be and I said no my Lord Lord then he
[14:59] answered and spake unto me saying this
[15:01] is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel
[15:04] saying not by might nor by power but by
[15:08] my spirit saith the Lord of hosts now
[15:12] what's what gives us our strength is
[15:13] these words that are represented in the
[15:15] old and the New Testament that God is
[15:17] empowering our lives with like like this
[15:20] is a symbol of it's it's his Spirit
[15:22] working in our lives that we're have
[15:24] having confidence in him to do and to
[15:27] work and to deliver in Psalms 37 it says
[15:30] rest in the Lord and wait patiently for
[15:33] him freten not thyself because of him
[15:35] who prosper in his way right because of
[15:38] the man who bringeth Wicked devices to
[15:40] pass just rest in God fear thou not
[15:44] Isaiah 41 for I am with thee be not
[15:46] dismayed for I am thy God I will
[15:48] strengthen thee yay I will help thee y I
[15:51] will uphold thee with the right hand of
[15:53] my righteousness amen now now again what
[15:55] we're talking about is he's the same
[15:57] yesterday today and forever and if we
[16:00] really believe that we'll have that kind
[16:02] of Faith to believe that he's still on
[16:04] the scene in Psalm chapter 62 it says my
[16:07] soul wait thou only upon God for my
[16:10] expectation is from him he only is my
[16:13] rock and my salvation he is my defense I
[16:16] shall not be moved and 1 Peter 5:7 says
[16:20] casting all your care upon him for he
[16:24] carth for
[16:26] you and I like this one 46 the one we've
[16:30] got over the on the ceiling there be
[16:33] still be still and know that I am God I
[16:37] will be exalted among the Heathen I will
[16:40] be exalted in the
[16:41] earth isn't that isn't that interesting
[16:44] that a lot of times when you're still
[16:46] when you just stop trying to do
[16:47] something that's when God goes to work
[16:50] God goes to work when you take your
[16:52] hands off the situation God goes work
[16:54] when you when you take a step back and
[16:56] let God do something and questions and
[16:58] answer she said I just went through now
[17:00] I I know I've read this story before but
[17:02] I I want to kind of belabor this cuz
[17:04] this is this is the essence of of of of
[17:06] how a Christian goes to battle with the
[17:08] devil he said I've just went through the
[17:10] experience with my Rebecca see just
[17:12] committed to God just commit it to
[17:15] God that's what we have a we struggle
[17:17] with like we we got to figure it out
[17:20] figure out how to fix things but just
[17:22] just give it to God Amen he said when
[17:24] she got to be a little teeny and she was
[17:27] going with some girl and we first went
[17:28] out there going run over to some girl's
[17:30] house taking piano music lessons and
[17:33] this girl I come by one day and he this
[17:35] girl was sitting there at the piano play
[17:37] and rock and roll well that was just
[17:39] enough for me so I told her stay away
[17:41] from over there see and then she said
[17:43] well this the only place I got to go to
[17:45] take music you know how teenies
[17:49] get and I said every kid has to go
[17:53] through that now that's some
[17:55] encouragement for parents it's that
[17:56] little phase of life when you're like
[17:58] what's going on but practically everyone
[18:01] goes through that age I sure remember
[18:03] when I went through that age and I sure
[18:05] remember when my kids went through that
[18:07] age I I remember when my brother went
[18:10] through that age we all go through that
[18:11] a that little that little period you did
[18:14] I did and we got to think we got to
[18:17] think their thoughts amen so then a few
[18:20] days after that her mother got after her
[18:22] for something and she sashed her now
[18:24] that's not Rebecca at all took off and
[18:25] slammed the door almost and knocked the
[18:27] things off the wall went to school now I
[18:29] ought to have seemingly just taken my
[18:31] belt off that is't that right where our
[18:33] mind goes a lot of times who boy I'm
[18:36] going to do it old school
[18:38] way we going to get a barrel slat and
[18:40] we're going to go to we're going to go
[18:42] to town but look look what he saying put
[18:45] put your thought and think about how
[18:47] they how what they're going through I I
[18:50] just taken my belt off and follow her
[18:51] out there in the yard and brought her
[18:53] back with warps around her se but I
[18:54] thought wait a minute I got to think
[18:57] 18yearold thought thoughts see now I
[19:00] said mother I know that she started
[19:01] crying ma I said now I know you done all
[19:04] you can do now there there's there's
[19:06] Moses and Aaron I know you done all you
[19:09] can do when youve done all you can do no
[19:12] matter what the situation is it's time
[19:15] to trust
[19:16] God I done all I can do now if it's out
[19:19] of our hands we have to take the next
[19:21] step and then she then she started that
[19:23] I took ma about an hour I said ma take
[19:27] your hands off Now isn't that Moses and
[19:29] Aaron take a step back and let God do
[19:32] something I can't do nothing what if I
[19:35] do something it's going to mess
[19:36] everything up if if you take that belt
[19:39] off it's you're going to mess everything
[19:40] up see just it's Moses and Aaron all
[19:43] over again me that's my kid I said isn't
[19:46] it mine too all right I said if she was
[19:48] dying this morning you'd have to commit
[19:49] her to God for her Eternal destination
[19:52] why can't we commit her to God now for
[19:54] her Earthly journey and she said well
[19:57] that's my kid I said I said it's mine
[19:58] too I said now can you take your me not
[20:01] saying nothing to her I said I never
[20:03] said that we'll we'll quit scolding her
[20:06] just advis her why cuz God's going to do
[20:10] something hey you ever notice when
[20:12] you're witness somebody somebody's just
[20:14] really on your heart they start getting
[20:16] upset and maybe they'll get a little ory
[20:18] why cuz something there's a battle
[20:20] taking place you just step back and let
[20:22] God go to work God can do it a whole lot
[20:24] more than we can now look I just put
[20:27] some made some bullets are some of these
[20:29] main points that he saying he said I
[20:30] never said that we'll quit scolding her
[20:33] just advise her and he said she needs a
[20:36] buddy and you're the one to be her buddy
[20:39] you and I we're her parents I said ma
[20:43] take your hands off now that's now see
[20:47] sometimes though let's let's let's
[20:49] balance it out we got to have a standard
[20:51] in our home I want to have a standard in
[20:53] my home but at the same time I want God
[20:55] to be able to go to work that's that's
[20:57] difficult sometimes to articulate right
[20:59] where you you want to have a standard
[21:00] where you you can't come in my house
[21:02] smoking marijuana you can't come in my
[21:05] house you know watching stuff that
[21:06] you're not supposed to do and and all
[21:08] that kind but at the same time we back
[21:10] up enough to let God go to
[21:13] work and God will go to work and
[21:16] questions and anwers he says so there we
[21:19] there got down on our knees and
[21:20] committed it to God I said I know now
[21:23] there's we struggle with that turn it
[21:26] over to God and let God do something I
[21:29] said I know she's 18 years old we'll be
[21:31] in a few days and she and a girl that
[21:33] age will think about boyfriends and
[21:35] we've kept her in I said I never wanted
[21:36] to see her get married I want to put her
[21:38] in the office here do the work I want to
[21:40] see her filled with the spirit and live
[21:42] like that and she well we all wanted
[21:44] that that's our will that's what the
[21:47] things well I I I think she should do
[21:50] this and this right but that there's
[21:52] where we put our hand to it she we all
[21:55] wanted that she she said well we can't
[21:57] do that said said she just won't listen
[21:59] to it I said wait a minute we've raised
[22:01] her all we can now put her in the hands
[22:04] of God commit her and I said then when
[22:06] she does anything say Becky darling
[22:08] mother don't want you to do that but I'm
[22:10] your pile I'll stick by you see let her
[22:12] know that you love her she's going to
[22:14] let get somebody to love her and it
[22:17] might be the wrong woman see I said you
[22:19] be the woman does the loving right I
[22:21] said honey that sounds kind of crude but
[22:23] people come everywhere and set on
[22:25] personal interviews and things I said
[22:27] I'm so common we're common to one
[22:29] another because we're husband and wife
[22:31] but we never let that happen you must
[22:34] remember this is the name of the
[22:37] Lord so let's just commit it to
[22:40] God and God and his people as we close
[22:43] here in the last few minutes he said
[22:44] commited to God believe it step out on
[22:47] it claim God's promise at the end of
[22:50] that story brother Brown was relating
[22:52] that she she ended up God got a hold of
[22:54] her and she ended up changing her
[22:55] changing her ways and and and and and
[22:58] gave herself to the Lord and so forth
[22:59] claim God's promise just commit it to
[23:02] God believe it commit thy ways unto the
[23:05] Lord he will bring it to pass whatever
[23:07] you want and the Church of the Living
[23:09] God he said accept it in a good heart
[23:11] already fertilized in all the creepers
[23:13] and the rocky places and the Stony
[23:16] doubts taken away and in good Rich soul
[23:18] of faith and believe it commit it to God
[23:20] and walk away testifying that you have
[23:23] received what God has promised you in
[23:26] questions and answers 1954 he said when
[23:28] I get these letters and they tell me
[23:29] well you can't do it just yet there's
[23:31] this has to be done and this has to be
[23:33] done then I don't I feel bad facing the
[23:36] people I don't know what to do but one
[23:38] thing I'll do this and you are with me
[23:41] I'm going to commit it to God and say
[23:43] now Lord when you're ready I am now
[23:47] there's the battle to just commit it to
[23:49] God and let God do something with it God
[23:52] bless
[23:53] you now let me let me stop right there
[23:56] and um just make a little quick
