house of the Lord good season they wanted to turn around and take somebody's hands may God bless you well we're here [Music] we were trying to think the other day and I think 1978 was the last time I was in this building I was a young scrapping boy getting ready to go to college and and no I didn't go to Mars Hill some of you thought I did but he did get his scholarship from there but I didn't know all right I went to a college around town and played baseball and not football but uh if I went to Mars Hill I've been up here a lot more because I love this place this is good I love it up here I I enjoy the people and I'm sorry it's been this long since we have not felt sick with each other I promise but I appreciate uh brother Andre opening up his pulpit and opening it up his time and look for the effort all of you can call over your name here in Irwin but but God bless you and thank you for what you've done you really really put on a show and we really appreciate that could not it would have been a starving Bunch been a bit hadn't been for y'all but it's some good food and and some good Fellowship but we sure enjoyed it and then all the ones from our church yeah probably about half is here and a half at home for the bottoms with them now but thank you for coming and putting forth in effort it takes an effort to come up and and take two or three days out of your time and and commitments and commit to to coming up here and fellowshipping I know some of you do know the background that we used to come up here a lot when we were younger and we all looked a lot younger and acted a lot younger but now we're older the Bible says now we're older we've come to a time where we got older many have passed many have left many are on the other side waiting on us man that's right wait on us to what come to Perfection yes because there will be a group I believe in the end time that will stand and look at death and as you were saying last night you have no hold on me because we've come to a place where God is going to indwell us so much it will be the living breathing moving instrumentality of God so the prophet tells us amen and we sure do know that by Foreign always God you would be here today and everybody would be here and everybody brother Joel good to have you with us today and he did a wonderful job last night foreign [Applause] each other about sermons we really don't but we're going to talk about babies a little bit today so if you were there last night you'll get part of it and then you'll get the rest of it today but it doesn't but we sure do appreciate both y'all coming in yeah that's right and we've always enjoyed being around him and we sure do appreciate it so if you got your Bible let's turn to the Book of Luke I do want to say before we get started uh from all of us at spoken word church and my dad uh back to where you know Tangled by the same Bell y'all know him you know him for years and years and years I want to read you a scripture that come to my heart just a few minutes ago and as bro Louise said we you know there's history between the two churches from a long time ago and we kind of drifted off apart from each other and the brother Jackson said it was time for us to get all back together we got it all back together now he said even he's been wanting for a long time so I hope that was your desire that we just don't hate each other so much we don't want to live with each other for an eternity hello don't start doing tomato we're good Ephesian food verse 14 says for he is our peace now that's not what I'm going to read but this is what we've come to thought just a few minutes ago he is our peace who hath made both one and have broken down the middle wall of petition the plaintiff I believe that it has been dissolved done away with don't need it no more we need God right we need God to to when we when we think about we don't want to think about how we can hurt somebody we want to think about how we can help somebody yes amen So today we're going to speak for just a few minutes I know the weekend's been long and like I said again sure to appreciate all of you but we're going to uh have a word of God and then go in in the evening and head back home and I hope it won't be 50 more years before we get together again I'm going to make sure that I'm just going to make my way up here and the prize come on come on okay I knew that'd be all right anyway I'm coming in here but we're going to put it today on anointed for a purpose you all walked in this door for a purpose you lived your life for a purpose you live your life in in Life or purpose in Christ for a purpose and as his bride for us yes all right you did not come here where God just said okay I'll bring this one here no you have a purpose right and I believe that that we're all now under an anointing that's even different from all the church ages yes yes my group you better say amen amen thank you I like the week I told him I said in Tennessee well not Tennessee Georgia was playing they'd be shouting all over the place but you know different anointing Luke 4 verse 17. to all of you and I saw some wedding pictures those names some of you were there and uh he's a lot younger but we sure do appreciate you we got it you the foundation that was laid like like brother Andre Nick orange was saying the foundation was late but the down but it would be for the rich Wilson different ones that lay the foundation that we stand on today yes we don't stand on a foundation that's that that's that's out there that's changed doctrines that's moved to this and forgot that and I was telling me at church the other day you know we've we've had just two pastors at Spoken Word Church whether Ernest Moten and Dad and uh that's been for 52 years we're celebrating our anniversary just a couple weeks ago July 4th and we sure appreciate God letting us have some stability stability even in your human life is what we want if you don't want turmoil you don't want stability yeah so now in the word of God we have received stability and we are we are resting on that and I'm resting on that we're going to take this to the coming of the Lord amen we're going to see that and I do it I'm just dumb enough to believe I'm going to be one of them amen you push me out but okay I'll bring you with me so we're going to speak on anointed for a purpose listen to this in Luke 4 verse 17. and that was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah now this is Jesus yes coming into the temple we're going to start in from the beginning and go all the way through but this is a this is the kind of the hinge point of what we're going to talk about because brother Brown calls this the greatest anointing yeah Abram in the face of the Earth amen right here this scripture it wasn't shouting it wasn't speaking in tongues it wasn't running the aisles now listen Jesus is the only one who can open the book right and he's the only one who can close but yes because when we get finished with this he closed the book man and he handed it back now are we living in a closed book page no no we're living because Christ came and he opened the book at the end of time we believe that Luke 4 17. and when he had opened the book they handed him a closed book he took it he opened it he found the place where it was written oh by the way Jesus was in church y'all ought to try that sometimes amen the fearing of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me now listen Jesus was almighty God Amen that's right he was the Holy Ghost all right he didn't need the Holy Ghost he was the Holy Ghost amen all right everybody with me but there's an anointing that comes after you receive the Holy Ghost because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captain or praise the Lord recovering the sight of the blind that was me we were all blind and said it literally them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord he closed them over and he gave it to the minister and sat down and all eyes were on him you fast enough and they're like man we've never heard this right now right you know why but they never had the word read the book they had never had the word read the word that's right they were reading the word but the word was reading the word he made a lie because he began to say to them this day this scripture in this building is being fulfilled amen amen let's follow this your Lord thank you for this time that we'll have thank you for this opportunity to speak to the greatest people that ever walked in the face of the Earth and Lord you know I mean that truly there's no greater office than being here Lord speaking to your people yes father I pray that you should be with each one Lord open our blinded Eyes Lord open our ears that we may see and hear you Lord you be the active participant in this service Lord please don't be a bystander Lord come in and take over father and you be the one to speak to the people and the one that revealed to him follow him there'd be any sick here Lord I know there's there's many ones that are there are afflicted in the body I pray Lord that you'd give them a quickening power today yes you could heal their body Lord it'd be anybody sick here in their soul yes Lord we need more than anything we need a healing of the Soul father I pray that you would as the word goes for it then it will sanctify a group of people for this journey that we're on yes even brother Andre Lord and the work he's doing here finally one of the most humble men I know was a meekest man I know but meekness is not weakness and I appreciate it Lord I Thank you for putting him in my life and they put him in our brothers and sisters right here well just be with each one now take care of some Jesus okay all right so get this party we want to look at Luke 4 verse 17 there's a little bit up or down down okay thank you so the word anointing means when you anoint something it means now this is literally what it means it means to smear something on you or spread a liquid because that's what they did in the Old Testament they put oil on the priest and anointed them with a literal oil that's right now we know that that was done away with in the Old Testament but now we see anointings in the spiritual realm we see anointings where it falls on you like I know many in this building is as old as we all are we've had we've had different anointings you've had an anointing to maybe speak in tongues where you had an anointing to do this or you had an anointing like I had one time where it felt like rain was falling on just the sweetest raindrops that was falling on me and I didn't want it to stop I wanted to stay there but of course it goes and moves because it's an anointing it doesn't stay and dwell like the Holy Ghost does everybody wins we'll get it somewhere because we're anointed for a purpose yes every one of us even the anointed ones at the end time they're anointed for a purpose right right even we're going to read here in the Book of Ezekiel amen so the word anointing me to smear or spread like a liquid also means to concentrate but in the spiritual realm it means a supreme quickening power and where we were brother I'm saying it was supreme power and control we know that all right we'll get to that that was the greatest anointing and that's what we're looking at brother Joe we're look we're not looking so much for a a shout or or speaking in tongues or or even healing we need healing absolutely we need a handle of our body but until we get this thing changed it's still going to get old it's going to get old and keep getting Fallen keep falling apart and keep having to put parts back on amen so in the spirit realm though we see that it's a supreme quick and empowered because when the anointing came on Jesus he said I've been anointed to preach amen he watched the preacher right but he was anointed to be the preacher that's right he was an anointed before the the the religious people of the day let's say the the Pharisees and Sadducees he was in church he opened that book and man they never heard a guy on a priest like this why there was anointing on it amen right even the way he probably said the same words that the priests have said for years and years and years but he he read I'm there way different than they did and why because he made it personal now come on I want us to make it personal amen the project Ronnie uh Johnson gosh well I want one for myself I'm just going to be selfish when it comes to that how long time to anoint me I want God to save me that's okay I want everybody to be saved but save me hard yeah all right all right so in the spirit realm it's a supreme court and in power so keep that in the back of your head yes I'm not going to be real fast I'm going to slow down a little bit because we got a little bit of time yes I don't have a button in my mouth but I do have a watch and it stops okay let's go to Ezekiel 28-14 Thou Art the anointed cherub that cover it now this is God speaking of Lucifer that's right right he's not speaking of Michael he's not speaking of his Angel he's speaking of the one he created to be the worship angel cast and used to hate for me to tell them that you know I'd be preaching along my spinning even boy knows he's laughing I remember but they Addison look for example you know but I told him I said Satan was God's first song leader it was an anointed child he was supposed to be and look that coverage so we had a recovering on him he had an anointing on him and he looked he wasn't ugly he was beautiful and I have set these so that was upon the holy mountain of God in other words he walked around where God was that's right amen thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stone of the fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou were created so now remember Satan had a beginning but we've got to see that we don't amen right amen right and then we got to pull this thing apart just for a minute because Lucifer was created and anointed yes right and by the way he was created and anointed he was created and anointed the Bible says until iniquity was found in so he made a choice even Satan had a choice right right and by Whitney they didn't have a choice listen God had a choice he didn't have to choose you he helped me you for nothing right right he doesn't need an air that he created the bread he don't need something to stand on he was before all of us amen but we sure need help amen amen we sure need him and in needing him there's our father amen amen as I'm telling the church the other day we'll probably Communists when you call somebody brother brother Joel now I don't care what skin color he is he's my brother he's in the family of God so when we say God bless you brother God bless you Sister you have pulled them into your family yeah yeah and we have the same father we have the same thing for so I say brother Donnie I'm not just saying all this brother Donnie no he's my mother yeah back here they're my literal brother and sister all right but you are my literal brothers and sisters in the gospel give us as much in the family of God and a lot of us that don't have family that are serving the lord but your church family is your the best family you've got that's right amen amen I'm just fortunate that my family's my church family did yeah a natural family but there was a guy named Lucifer he was created and anointed everybody with me right he had a beginning and he's going to have an end even though he's listen that anointing has not come off of him that's right that anointing is still on it he's just using it different than what God give it to him for in the first place everybody with me here right so in Genesis 1 I know most of everybody that goes my church realizes that we're gonna rock about dentists in one of just about every sermon I preach to me Genesis 1 26 and 27 tells everything Redemption everything is going to happen where you're going what you're doing you're going to have a Dominion you're going to have power you're going to be male and female and brother Joel was saying they're having a problem with that nowadays I am not says uh and God standing there in eternity he said I need somebody to talk to I need someone to Fellowship I need a family yes and they're inside me right and I'm going to get them out God can only do that amen and he knew exactly who they were now listen this Genesis 1 26 man was not every man that was created in the place of this Earth and by the way all right no brother I know brother Andre you know because he's heard it for years and years Genesis 1 26 is God's people Amen to me that is an extension of God yes it's actually God in another core because I know it says he created but remember you got to look at that word as he fashioned he fashioned a group of people in His image am I women but now he created Satan over here separate created him give him an anointing give him a job all right these people this Genesis 1 26 group of people it's not an anointing that's right amen amen if the person of God in another form called writing yes so you didn't have a beginning but yeah you were formed you were created to land you know God created a man in his own image and him is where God created him male and female greedy to them I don't mean the Bible for that recorded so many times but look and what happened whiskey you say well I still see that word created you know that all the computers all these Ventures all this steel your car that you drove here was in the Garden of Eden that's right amen nothing you look at the same it was laying out there in the elements and and then all of a sudden in about 1912 or somewhere I might have named Henry Ford he created an automobile he didn't create it like God would create it he created it from the substance that was already here that's right right so he fashioned or formed a car all right we brought that car it had the beginning but the elements that it happened the elements you were originally made of will never go away this is right he fashioned you in His image and then he knew you would come here and he knew you would want it so he added there to give it to you he didn't have to go scrambling through through his inventory and go Joel Brown I don't know if I knew no we already knew you were going to be here in that Genesis 126 man like I said it's not in the morning it's an image it's God an extension of God it's something that he wanted to express and he wanted to be able to see but we know what happened in regarding the people right right Lucifer was so anointed he knew what the plan of God was and he stepped in all right make a long story short we know what happened in the garden I don't have to go through it all right and that marred as the prophet of God said Mark the masterpiece but remember brother Graham said The Mooring of the Masterpiece is what made it the masterpiece that's right here right maybe your worst enemy but God wanted you in this human class foreign your new birth is not your anointing and it's not your adoption that's right right amenities so you've got your you've got your regular verb We're not gonna talk about that anymore we're gonna everybody's born again it will open my mind okay everybody's morning all right so everybody has a piece of that Genesis 1 26 in your soul the only you were was burnt out the nature that was attached to your goal was burned done away with the old used Dead all right amen now gold used to tell lies you've got two husbands and you can't do that right right no husband can't be putting out in divorces put in the closet he's got to be d-e-a-d dead right but in in killing that then God brings the new birth or the birth to you that he wanted in the first place you know amen that is 126 man in the Garden of Eden he wanted you to be there he wanted you to come the way he wanted you to come by Spoken Word not by the way they came Hey listen everybody in this building came the same way that's right I don't care how big little short back skinny all of you are pretty but you all came the exact same way amen amen all right so there ain't no big island we know where we come from and if we don't get this thing anything and get out of here we're going to where the end is all right all right so that's that's my whole life grow up amen every Minister from Philadelphia preach abroad you gotta grow you can't stand baby you've got to grow amen nothing worse than seeing a mild nurse child go ahead bro nothing worse than seeing a malnourished Christian Child somebody's supposed to be in the message 40 years and still act like they're 10. still need to be sucking on a bottle until they eat meat right come on now don't give me these right here they're incisors they're deter me with them yeah right I like milk yeah milk's okay a little bit of it right but listen an eagle's the only animal in those four combat beats that was born to not drink milk amen and it's perfect right the lion had its birth Ops the man all three of those you had to have milk to get started with that's right that's right but the eagle not the Eagles are standing there and opens his low mouth and Mama chews the word up every Sunday and every Wednesday come on somebody chews that up and makes it down into a little bit it'll be pieces it doesn't choke you with it she know how to put it down in there not kill that baby but once that baby grows up he goes and says gravity that's right food and here he goes it takes off he doesn't make his mama to do it for him anymore that's what I want to be I don't watch the moment I have to do listen I want to come to adoption where we don't have to cry Daddy Daddy all the time amen we don't have to find Donnie Reagan or any of these brothers like I find my pastor no how about doing it for you I've been talking about that day and I had to call him that's that anointing that we were given and we were talking about yesterday that was where predestinated gifts give to the church to what perfect her amen amen you can't do a precious way doctor from series 1960 brother Riley he's talking about he's asking questions now what is adoption all right so your bird is here and your adoption is here and then all the other anointings that we're going to talk about in a few minutes so now you say well I'm born again and brother around said when you were born again you got everything you needed for your journey well listen when you were born a baby you didn't gain no new part right when you got an 80 not a lot of him but you didn't gain anything right you were born a human right you had five fingers I told them each hand and feet you had a mouth you had to go out but you couldn't drive a car right not when you were up 10 12 14 next thing I hope not much but why who's still human right that's right yeah right we had to come to a position yet right amen we hadn't come to a position in God yet for him to give us the key to the father that's right right and say go on son this is yours you drive it that's right this is your word I produced it I put it here I made it for you now I'm going to give it to you and see what you can do about it all right that's why I want us to come right well we can't take the car keys well we all have to be nervous well we don't have to be uh frustrated because listen out there is frustrated or nothing yes that's going to be frustrated in the gospel God will help you if you ask him to the problem is that we don't ask him we think we got it all figured out sometime and we don't but you know what your child with God he's going to give you one of those stimulation things I was talking about last night right and he's going to make you go back in line right that's right man that's what he's doing now what a wonderful father Yes a wonderful God he is thank you Lord sir I want to read this quote from the believer the position in Christ 1955. I wish we had it on the screen we had a strange at the church and I'm sorry if I keep reading scriptures real fast and you're not turning into pages to get to it it's usually already popped up on the screen so I apologize for that but it is better for you to read it you then you know that I'm not telling you something different that's right pull up now God our Father he's praying now listen because he's praying foreign God we're trying our best and following you and everything that we do or say send him into the building just now now why do you need somebody in the building he was a prophet he had the Holy Ghost obviously there's no way we can deny he didn't have the Holy Ghost that man had bad then Milo ago but he needed an anointing to come into that room or into that before he was having prayer line so we speak we had a prayer line he said what I'm waiting on him why is he waiting on him that's an anointing a special yes Park that come down into his life and then it would go off of him he said he would you know they'd take him back and he'd have headaches for days and they said he would be dizzy and didn't know what he was doing well that was in anointing that came on him but the thing came off of him all right everybody he's praying send him into the building Lord put a fresh anointing on every Minister here never landed well I say the same thing today man that's as bad as Presbyterian catholic whatever you are father they're here because they love you and we're groaning waiting for that time of adoption and we believe now this is the prophet now you believe God sent a prophet the same congregation some of y'all there's only three of them that do you know I must have come this wrong building oh I need to leave God sentence you need to find the Lord and we'll pray for you we're groaning waiting for the time of adoption and we believe that one of these days the Holy Spirit look we'll move in not with the new birth it makes that specific comma not with the new birth for for we receive that through Christ but you'll adopt your church then amen am I waited it's from believer the position in Christ 1955 then she'll be clothed in the power of the resurrected Lord and we pray father that you'll do this quickly for the day looks so dark 1955. yes sir the day looks so dark and evil ahead we pray that you'll adopt us now Lord into your family give us the authority that we need father to make the game Sayers keep still that's what I want I want these naysayers they don't believe brotherhound with the prophet and don't believe this message is true I want that they're one of them their father will be man manifest yes right amen amen 1954 impressive questions questions and answers there's no brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year what all theologies failed to do in 2000 yeah so you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home to that Faithful Little Remnant yes amen after the doors of the Gentile churches close oh God will anoint a church then so there's an anointing coming in my folks my brothers you believe that there's an anointing coming that we've not even had before right right now God will anoint a church then he who felt me letting me filthy still he who's righteous let him be righteous to them he who is Holy let him be holy still and God will anoint the church with the power of God and things will take place yes not only that then but he's doing it now amen right so there's not there's no there is one coming a great one coming but there's one he was saying there's one here too 55 that's right there is one in word form the words got to be anointing all right it doesn't matter if you you're the words got to be anointed and we know the words are on it and whenever when it comes into you and it won't shoot all right but let's look good for him yet with the Old Testament in types and shadows because we know you can't do away with the Old Testament the Old Testament is given as what we said for an example the Bible says for an example for us that the end of Earth was coming through so he's for us to look back I mean how many people have heard uh you know teachings on Abraham and I know some of you may have came from another denomination or or something that they yeah they'll talk about this and Father Abraham but they never really knew who Abraham was the prophet of God knew whoever it was and who Abraham was amen and he taught us the difference in the two amen right amen Abram didn't have the promised son Abraham had the promise sign right so there had to be a change and then then thank God uh Prophet told us they had a body change 99 year old Sarah and he wants her oh she had a body tank so that's what we're looking for but we got to meet my cousin this first you got to meet God in human flesh before that happens we'll talk about that yesterday Exodus 30 verse 30. we'll just read this real quick I know we understand this we've already talked many times Thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so they literally poured this oil onto these uh uh to Aaron and his sons for them to go do the job in the temple all right everybody it was a holy anointing oil and I was just paraphrase just the same time God told him he said Do Not Duplicate this right Do Not Duplicate this Holy Ghost it's only going to come one way and it's going to come by justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not going to come now listen there's a lot of people going to be anointed about the Holy Ghost is going to happen you can get why to do on this all right that's the truth right this shall be a holy anointing oil unto me through your Generations you shall not make any like it after the composition of it it is Holy leave it alone he said whoever compounded it or make it this anointing oil just regular oil he's going to be cut off from people they're kicking him out there to keep you out you're not an Israelite anymore that's how that's how strong it is not just in the Old Testament though all right they're by waiting so now Moses let's look at Moses the Bible tells us that that Moses killed an Egyptian and Moses made a lot of mistakes but when Moses was speaking for God his face shown so much until they had to turn away and had to cover this face now that was an anointing what a strong anointing that was right because it would come off of him he didn't keep that all the time but he had an anointing to speak instead of God or in God's dead because remember when he said flies flies came when he said frogs frogs came there was a creation in his voice now remember Moses was not born again all right am I winning sure no more again the Old Testament there was no one born again that's right they had anointings but they weren't born again right okay even John the Baptist my morning yeah I swear a difference I mean think about that for a little while 1954 concerned we have a good cheer watch it look at Jonah the prophet after receiving inspiration that kept him alive in the whale's belly what an anointing to being a whale's belly yes and preached with such inspiration to a seat in the size of Saint Louis all out of repented and then after the spirit left him he sat under a little tree in a gourd tree and prayed God let me die all right look at any lines of the Prophet after calling fire down out of Heaven called Rain Out of Heaven the same day the spirit left him he run into the Wilderness and Jezebel he was afraid of that woman right so that's the anointing that came on and then that anointing came off and he became just a normal person all right so we'll look at something though because there's something the Bible tells us about one individual that says you see the spirit the sin all right yes and remain right amen amen right that's right we know who that is all right so that's what we're getting to for now look at Samson Samson now listen Samson what they look like Arnold Schwarzenegger you know the the when you watch the Samson move in when you've got they're all packed out and everything no hey it's a little big kid that Chevy little pretty little curls but when the anointing that he was purpose for right yes anointed for a purpose he was anointed for that purpose to destroy the foolish thing as long as he kept that anointing on him he was oh he could pick up tons yes yeah tons those Gates weigh tons not just hundreds of pound times right he just pick him up go set him down that see that was a mystery it wouldn't be a mystery if he was as big as Arnold Schwarzenegger or somebody like that that wouldn't be the mystery they know always just wrong he works out now he's a little Shrimp Boy and he's walking around all humped over you know and all of a sudden he kills a thousand of them well that's why they wanted to know what where he got his anointing from where'd you get your strength from all right right of course we know what happened yeah amen he lost all that because he got out of the world going that's right but remember in the end he took out more than he did I want to be that way I want to be if it comes down to the end of the girl I want to be where God says enter in you've destroyed more in the end of your life is in the first feelings out of here to destroy him off right well here let's come to David now remember as brother of Joel was preaching last night check yourself just a minute David was anointed to be king that's right first Samuel 16 10. I want you to look at this real you know you believe in numbers and numerology yes we believe in touch we believe in numerology we had a Prophet come and tell us what a five what a four what a three what a six what a two what an eight was yes yes it was right he told us all those numbers so let's look at this in first name of 16 because David and and taking nothing away from Harper Jones said it took the faith and it took David to be at the right place at the right time but remember David had an anointed amen that's right that's right amen amen he was anointing for his kindness but remember though he was anointed to be king but remember he was anointed as a boy he did not become king for years after right right yeah that's annual anointing now here here's the situation now God listen God send a prophet right that's right to anoint someone to be a king his name was Simon that's right that sounds familiar boxing a problem God said a problem give me anointing oil foreign first Samuel 16 10 says again Jesse made Seven of his sons to pass before Simon sounds good doesn't it but in seven Church ages that wasn't somebody anointed to destroy the Giant that's right David was the eight point amen the Lord hath not chosen these and Samuel sending to Jesse or hear all thy children and he said they're reminded yet the youngest and behold and keepeth the sheep and he stands he's a smell planning but he's pretty standing infection for we will not sit down till we come now here's a prophet stand that the guy's going and he's got this anointing oil and God sent him to that place listen God sent him to your place yes amen and he sat and brought him in now he was running with all of the beautiful countless and good to look at good looking kid and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is him right because I'm sure Samuel money those seven boys they were probably big Paul Dyson he went over to this one and God said no he didn't feel anything it was nothing well so all I want to say this is there's gotta be a little more there's got to be something something's missing all right likely brother randomly questions and answers brother George yet got the new seal button he asked me yesterday or Friday brother George Smith he said what's what is the greatest part of the seal book to you and everybody would say silence and having their best or that the greatest uh time that brother Branham the quote that I love brother around a blade he was on the questions and answers on the seals that morning and he said you're not getting it yeah it's not for you right yes right amen now what he's saying he said you're not even supposed to get it that's what he said amen amen amen so that was somebody all right Hallelujah in 2023 yes that's gonna get it it was not born there let her know he failed them just like Samuel was like nope nope not that group nope not that good and he's probably going Lawrence they're going to live a good life uh they're going to live the message the best they can but there's a group coming hallelujah it's going to fall on every man and she's going to be an invincible Army amen amen all right thank you brother those words that arise anointing for this is he yes then Samuel put the heart of oil an anointed him in the midst of his brother I bet you they were probably looking at him a little bit sideways right David what this this end time right she looks horrible somebody told me one time and said you know you don't say Brad looks horrible I said brother the bride ain't never looked horrible that's right right you might be looking at mixed multitude foolish version but the bride has always been beautiful always will be beautiful you've got to find her all right all right because all Israel not Israel that's right I think Sam will cook the heart of oil and anoint him in the mission to try to scare the Lord look the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward yeah Daddy's house there had been a war yet there have been a life we didn't go out maybe the teenager you know probably seven foot tall by land but but he had to wait a little while but right so that would come up let's set this scene like a brother did last night Dave's keeping the Sheep now listen he's been on it and put a clown on him yet right he has not said on the throne but he's been anointed that's right so and I'm sure that anointing oil probably he probably washed it off I'm sure he still didn't have that anointing hole that he had you know for years back now he washed it off but listen you can't watch the anointing no sir all for yourself you can't watch the anointing out of a prayer cloth you can't watch the anointing off once it comes on you and the Bible said and Sacco said this is going to be our King right here amen I don't care how long it takes all right right 60 years since you probably left no matter how long it takes you well we can what a consolation if you'll believe that listen try this he believed what the prophet said try that sometime that's it bro okay so David he's not going he's not sit down going well I'm king I don't have to do this sheep thing in the morning I you know I don't like them no lab I'm just kind of just sit right here under this tree and God's gonna just make me King no no you know why he was my pain God knew he wouldn't do that amen God knew it would be frivolous in his Christian experience amen he would continue on even though the anointing was not always on it that's right but one day one day in his walk he hears a noise you know he kind of sneaks up and even this even his brothers his older brothers are like what are you doing here what are you going to say in this church right right what are you doing in these meetings yeah what are you doing here you're supposed to be out there you you didn't have a sign or a Wonder in all your life they said boy aren't you remember I killed a bear one time I killed the line at one time so I had a little bit of experience here I just never killed a person yet okay look remember he went to the to the camp and here's what here's all the other Church ages standing around going will you go in here we thought you were you know you need to go back and take care of your sheep oh Daddy's calling you David may have turned around and said yeah I probably better leave that there's there's no like me being here but when he turned he heard a voice yes that he didn't like amen that's right he heard a strange sound right come from across the valley yes yes and that strange sound wouldn't shut up he just kept it fine the armies of Israel yes he kept defying he defied that he signify this whole Army send me one oh he didn't know uh they haven't paid money it's final final and he looked at Goliath and he didn't measure him up you know what he saw he saw a crown and a throne yes right that's right amen amen yes sir he saw a crown that's wrong yes sir he saw a promise because he believed what his Prophet said amen amen so how could he die right how could he die you tell me how David could die if Samuel was a true Prophet a true anointing was on him he was going to be king why [Music] you're uncomfortable if you realize that we are doing what the prophet told us he has anointed us Amen to leave this place standing up not seek for you amen bro he was a flip of the radar that's what we gotta look at death because all David saw was I'm gonna be king I gotta get through this though I gotta take this test right [Music] deaf where do you stand right yes right amen great where's your picture yeah one day folk we're gonna do the same thing with them Daniel call up your sleeve and you'll just wipe it off it off listen when we say death Christian if you say death you got that little tangle in your in your in your whatever you want to say coach we're human we see that we see what that thought but why are we teaching what that is let's teach what life is and Goliath was only just a blip in his radar Goliath was not 9 feet or 14 feet tall he was just an obstacle that David had to get through to get to the front amen so that's the way I see that I see that David was anointed to be king sure he believed that so much give a bear get a line didn't fall in the bed come up to go out because he wasn't like to have I need to go back I need to find my cool book all right I need to go talk about laundry I mean I really got to get you know nobody said hey you quick Define the army of God or something is going to happen to you buddy that's right that's the same thing definitely been defying us for years but there's an anointing on this ride in the end time for somebody to stand up and say yeah you've been destroyed all right amen thank you amen you show us a fairy tale well we'll do your funeral that's right come on that's right am I right amen I'm just playing we're either going to go in here we're going to go out of here standing up or we're going to have to come hunt for the resurrection no shame in either one that's right no shame in England not at all right but don't you want to be here again I've heard about this great thing that's come this great tarantula this great Resurrection this great coming back together where I don't move my finger anywhere right we're this glorified body yes it's going to just materialize amen it's not fair Capital it's my favorite thing you watch all that junk on DC and comic books that's just the kind of what's going to happen to you when they morph into this and morph into that you know they become superhuman but remember they all got a flaw whatever you want to put in that there's not been one that stood and said I'm the Champion right and never been undefeated well we have one amen and he's not in the comic book he's in your heart yes sir well let's be David let the leaders David and throwing stones let's just believe that we the Bible tells us we are to be what priests and King so we've been anointed right right finally anointed word and we have an anointed Prophet come and give us a neural in the word for an anointed people amen amen so Lord I looked at that real funny when they said smear you know when anointed means to smear like peanut butter on a sandwich well you know what Lords hear me [Music] you want I'd like to be smeared by God yes amen amen trying to go out of service without being as well in 1965. good grace listen we got a whole time Memorial yes right see how the Holy Spirit now let's look at this we got to look at the flip side because there's pops anointed one there's an anointing coming and it's here now that's false yeah the Holy Ghost is not fault the anointing end right but really brother and Paul didn't Point some false anointed ones right well now look here's we're trying to do a lot of service this is right about the time when you're preaching that I'm not going to 65. he said see how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man but it's got to be in the order of the anointing right yummy it's got to be in the order of the anointing the outside Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the soul is darkest picture that's right amen folks that's why we've had people come along as you have here we've had at our church where they come in and then disappear yes amen but we had one this brother set on the front row and this was the greatest thing since last bread and he was like right on the front rows like Dad said though it was like a candle that burned both hands and we burn out real quick right amen disappear give thought he was a candidate for being right but you didn't get it in here he just got in the morning he got caught up in the moment I don't want you to get caught up in a moment no sir the only time I was get caught up and then the moment it went from an eye amen all right the taco bird grows on the same water that builds that puts life into wheat but at the bottom he's still a go to work it's rejoicing blooming got life doing everything that the wheat does soul is still a customer false teachers can rise teaching all kind of trinitarianism and everything else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can but by the word their fault that's right that's right man wow how you like that tremendous but remember brother Round Lake system and he may say specific he's got to be in the order of the anointing [Music] 1963 brother around my world Fallen apart he finds out he said we find out the same things in place of Egypt when Moses led the children of Israel the whole Egyptian system had become corrupt well pray to God did the same thing right here all right whole places become corrupt we find out now and take it away from God sent an anointed messenger amen down there when did it work it was to fulfill his word that's right you say it wasn't to fulfill his work yes he told Abraham that's exactly what he would do and there had to be someone come on the scene at that time to make that word live right before them God sent Moses remember around many many times he said he had said Moses with Noah's message if it's in Noah would John I mean Governor mentioned no he sent him with the right message in other words you sent him with a writer anointed and there had to be someone come on the scene at that time to make that word live right before them so he said God sent Moses the first thing he promised to do he did because he was the anointed word for that hour he said he would judge the world God's word said I'll judge that Nation with Great Mighty wonders and signs there through the man just an ordinary man like you or me got the word from God and went out there and spoke creation that's right into existence that's right wow oh take that sign and say please come from the Earth and the word of God through that prophet's mouth being it was right in the hour it was supposed to be fleas came all right amen amen amen all right he covered the Earth with frogs why he covered everything because God made the promise like I said before God made David a promise to a prophet yes he was going to be a king didn't matter what he he was going to be amen amen that's right that's what we got to see yes right you know um some of my children are one of them is out in the world but you know you can't look at the trial part all right the test right because remember what brother Graham say about the baby he said he saw him already for the baby because he got the birdie and the Burdine the booties and all that stuff and pins and all that because he could see that baby I see my children said in the church I received that other stuff to do right you know what I can't save them you can't save them my mom tried to save him for 20 years and I promise you the problem won't go away but you sure learn how to handle it amen amen I've always said the Holy Ghost doesn't take away all your problems but it will help you get through it yes yeah by the way all right God made a promise and the hour was there for it to be anointed the anointed word for that hour that they lived in that's what we need today is not back into some Seminary system but the anointed word for the hour that we live in to bring forth Jesus Christ to the world again so yesterday your day and forever there's a program laid out for this day a promise of God and the only way that we're ever going to be able to get right is to let the word been on it amen amen that's right it's always happened yes we find out the great moral pollution in the days of medical Nebuchadnezzar he had to win anointed when the handwriter was on the wall he had a man standing there amen they said what you had a man say their politics was rotten everything was falling apart now we've done the same thing turned back around and corrupted the word of God by systematic religion till we finally falling apart there is nothing at all we can do listen there's nothing at all we can do but come back to that anointing word for your hour amen listen Luther's polio losers justification will not even put you in the body that's right amen Amen brother amen that's right that's right Wesley's sanctification yeah it'll clean you up make you live better you can be anointed because the mountain the hole goes in your soul yes sir amen that's the word of this item that's my program it didn't come to change anything he just come to tell us that's exactly what you're supposed to do all right we just find Sanctified I truly believe in all three because you know what I went through all three man if you can't say I don't know right you got to know that you know though yes sir absolutely you can't sit down and watch your story being a Christian that's right amen I got saved right here I got Justified right here got Sanctified right here I got filled with a hold of it you gotta know that yeah sure and you got to put a state down he said well I don't know well go back man you got all the time you're still alive all right let God catch the Bible God sanctify me tell me what the Holy Ghost I may have been a name believer for years that's right but maybe a True Believer now amen because this is anointing now for not bad it's to get out of here and I promise you one thing folks Noah preached 120 years he was anointed to preach that message but one day God said that's it that's right I'm sure Noah hey friends I'm sure no one had other family members like you know Uncle and whatever sure and he was compelling them to come in like we do come to church come on come in here but one day God shut the door and said that's it that's right no one's going to handle no one's coming out uh the days of the Gentiles are about over the quote that's right I'm not going to shut the door brother no the library come shut the door no any other manager is going to shut the door God's Gonna shut the door say that's enough that's right that's right that's enough we've been preaching for all these years there's a time to go up we went around horror we went to the desert we've done everything we we 60 years that's right it will produce itself amen yeah it will whether you want it you sat there all day long like brother said you can sit there and say son ain't coming up something coming up son ain't coming up let's start I'm Brian Sonny coming up I'll promise you about 6 15 in the morning you'll be pretty wrong you don't have wasted your time no the sun's gonna come up amen there will be a message it is a message but there will be a message anointed to carry us out the gifts amen and I believe we're under in that matter I truly do Matthew 3 verse 16. now here we are let's let's look at Jesus real quick yes let's give it to him we've been in anointing in the Old Testament which came on a group of people and it would leave it would come on David he'd write the great Psalms and he would do all these wonderful things but yet when it only came off of him he had his best friend killed a lot that's right General David would have died he hadn't had a problem there that's right what did David say bring up man here you know Nathan comes in and says you know this is still on the sheep and all this stuff they even don't sell prices David at the time he was King already you know I already had a crown on his head he said Grant what's my plan God bring them here probably look Davis said you're the man David that's right right you're the land he said the black he said but David I prayed for you yes amen all right Jesus in Matthew 17. amen John 17. amen amen thank you Lord to me that's my Lord's Prayer that's the other one but this is my Lord yes sir brother amen that's right Matthew 3 verse 16 said Jesus when he was baptized went straight up out of the water and looked the heavens were open and he saw the spirit of God to send you like a dove and lighting upon him all right so we're watching this scene we're looking at this scene as a common buried we see Jesus we see John we see the baptism received come out of the water and then we see well Albert we see this this form this morning he pronounced it in the Book of Luke he said preach that's it amen 29 and a half years those silent years he might have said a few things but it wasn't for me and you that's right but that thing LED on him he had a three and a half year old job amen absolutely all right yes sir remember they tried to kill it many many times but without anointing on anything and what anointing was that yeah the voice that this is my beloved Son and whom I well pleased and they didn't say here to him either right that's right man had to wait for Matthew until he went until he lived a little bit longer through his journey almost getting ready to calibrate then he goes up on them um a mountain yes right and God adoption this is my beloved Son and whom I please did well hear you yeah amen so this first part there had to be something extra that was added thank you Lord yes remember you get everything you need for your journey but you just don't know how to use it right I believe the Bible even tells us that Jesus grew in what gracious knowledge and being made perfect amen being made perfect we came to author of our salvation it is Humanity he had issues amen right yes sir right that's right we look at brother Brown I was reading yesterday or the other day we were still in the tax report man we're on brother Cottage 117 119th sermon look at that but um run around tells about he had complexes he had a critical spirit get on him y'all know because I read you the quote he had a critical spirit get on him he had a selfish Spirit get on it he would have committed suicide amen one day they went through the motions no he took his glove off and reached look alive that's right amen he took the gun out and loaded it would have been a murderer also he got a real mad got his 22 out loaded that thing up and I'm seeing him running down that dirt road trying to shoot them with nothing going on he delivering the time to shoot them kids that's right oh y'all get quiet when you start going by the problem like that come on man go ahead it was an example but look he overcome every one of them so can you yeah yes sir I like it you know brother randomly we always try to find this sorry this magic potion we try to take this quote mention them with this one and put a little scripture on it you know and and come up with this well here go wash this and bar soap here go wash yourself with it this will take care of everything I've got a stingy Spirit what do I do gotta look at Jesus you got to do this you got to do all this what he's having to do he said do the vice versa what a revelation amen all right and I know y'all mountain people I want lots of worship bands they wanted some great sermon no surprise give it away yes sir simply that right all right and now to me though that's how simple Christianity it is we'll do it right amen amen there is no magic potion there is no magic there there is some promises though all right what's this point she and yesterday the other day I'm sorry they'll fall out sometimes you call people playing they go [Music] I know you won't but she said she stood the other day and she was so profound when I'm singing on the same thing she said I have done what God has told me to do as far as promises for his kids for kids or or whatever or XYZ but you got to put yourself in it too she said I'm done what I'm supposed to do that's our problem a lot of times amen you know we like to put people in water baptize it we want to get them wet I've baptized a lot of wet centers because Peter said it repent right right amen and then be baptized amen right so it says the latest said well I've done today you know she goes through and it is it is kind of a formula a little but the prophet taught us when we've done all we know to do when we lay them in the hands of God when we close our eyes and say God bear yours what are you saying when you've done everything to do he said stand Stan [Music] so you know what she's done she has triggered God's word and has made him do what he said yes amen amen amen he cannot do it may not be today gotta have patience right there yes amen but he will do it if he'll do everything you're supposed to do amen you see people struggle can I preach this man yeah you see people struggle with finances they ain't paying the time right right all right I can't afford to you can't afford not to that's right amen all right well I got all these issues that singing in church in three weeks this one yeah you'll do what God said he's got a honor what is it amen God honor his word and that's our Anointed The anointing for the end time is for God to do what his word said it would do amen all in a nutshell yes that's what you and I are here to do say God you said it now you're gonna have to change my body I can't all right amen well I keep getting older and older there's an 18 year old inside there yes sir if you guys remember that Genesis 126 man I'm not old no sir right man please 18 years old is that danger it's that album that God took that you're created in that image he had to get your mom and daddy here to bring you your image here but God must really like it because brother is not going to be six foreign [Music] [Music] saying I saw the Spirit that John was a prophet like brother Ryan was a prophet I was looking in one of your books you can see the hood remember brother Ryan said to the hood over that sister yeah I see he was looking at around but nobody had ever seen him right he was so much back and forth praise God we don't have to do I want to thank every one of y'all up I don't want to discern the half of you don't all right listen when they won they hooked brother around the neck he knew that they liked him or nothing new yeah I don't want all that I want to thank everybody it got me you know he drives everybody crazy but brother Brown because he don't want to come again that's what I mean about that he picked that person he picked that character that brother couldn't handle that you and I can't handle it anyway I love one another preacher said one time he said you know brother Ryan stood up maybe two or three times in his endurance his uh sermons and he'd say you know he said I can't keep a secret I just can't keep a secret well assistant God he can't keep a secret I'm glad he totally everything God told him that we needed amen I'm glad he didn't take that with him I'm glad he gave us 1100 sermon and that was God talking to me and you to remember amen before we've had the end time folks we've had it late in the Flash right here and moved on right so anyway so here's John here's John here's the prophet he's in the water and he baptized Jesus and he said I say saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like I dove and what it does like it does so it's flubbering down and evolved upon him a ball upon him if I went if you read it from 1 verse 32 verse 33 and I knew him not right but he that sent me to baptize with water which was the one that led him out of the Wilderness which was the Father which was Jehovah God or every however you want to say his name the same said unto me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him there's no doubt he had been around maybe some of the Pharisees or maybe even countless he'd seen calculus and being a prophet he could see God was heading towards the temple and he'd see an anointing fall on him that's that's right amen but when confused come out he see that in the morning leaving he'd see those Pharisees you see anointing fall on them that's right right but God instructed the prophet he says whatever the ones you see whatever the one he didn't say a bunch he said one that's a bunch now but he said whoever you see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as which baptizes with the Holy Ghost that's right amen so remember he didn't need the Holy Ghost that's right amen the Bible says his Spirit was a spirit sometimes the Bible comes back to the prophets brother Ron said in the holy spirit all right so so you know you believe whatever you want to about Jesus being a normal man over here and then being God over here be careful that's right all right you make him another person get making schizophrenic if he had two or three personalities inside of it that's right all right I just believe he was born Emmanuel God would amen that's enough for me what the Bible says all right he went Park God he called God that's what the president Ryan said all right I'll repeat him in he said we get it by measure he got it without measure all right amen so without measure means everything means a whole cup that's right all right all right but he didn't have a human side he didn't have a human flesh he didn't have a human brain that he had to live because he had to live like me and you had to be on touch do not remember we look and we see now I want you to kind of polish your brain up a little bit we know that the prophet of God told us that when Jesus stood and he said who do men say that I am right I'll tell you a lot so tell you this and tell you that so who do you think of it I'm asking you today what do you think this message is the Bible right right well I've heard tape or I've heard Brothers I want to know what you know about it I don't know what you say about it I want to know your experience if you don't have one you need to fight and get one that's right amen but God and spirit if I went to a conversation right amen but that Spirit came into human flesh on one one we've been reading it for 119th sirens in the beginning was the word with wood God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh how many of y'all thought about Jesus when I said that I know a lot of people did I think I mean amen the word has now become flesh right amen sure he did back there but that's our example right but right here today and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us the world is going to know just for the moment that God walked at a bunch of people on this Earth yes sir amen right just for a moment [Music] and listen if you're somewhere else just like my dad has always said if you want to take a train trip a trip on the train don't buy a ticket it's Airline down I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time but you got to take it well you got taken the wrong place right right place right time all right let's go son of man though the Son of God is the spirit of God right that's right the son of man though was the preacher he was the word made flesh he was the one they could hold on to they never understood that man never understood they knew they was there was parts of them they were saved that's something about you that's right that's right come Jesus asked him a question who do the house say I'm the son of Manning he didn't even answer the question because he didn't know the question that's right he just knew that was something about him yeah but on the day of Pentecost when that man came back into that group of people yeah yeah yes and I'm going to tell you something if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost who wrote this the Holy Ghost wrote this good man that's right now if you open it it's the Holy Ghost read what the Holy Ghost wrote amen amen and if it's Christ if you've got the true baptismal logo you can't say something to me can't say something this this can't say something different got to say the same thing that's why the son of man Ministry had to come back at the end time under the Son of God Ministry listen just for a few minutes under the son of God's Ministry Luther could preach trinitarianism Holy Ghost God went to the dignity because he didn't that wasn't the time that wasn't the anointing for that moment that's right right John Wesley the same way he could appreciate trinitarian Doctrine and God would say oh that's okay I just want you to do this I want you to get my people sanctified amen come to the Pentecostals I want you to be able to to uh expound from the gifts I want you to be able to use the gift because I'm going to say the prophet see if God would have sent a prophet and Luther's a our Prophet people will be going like whoa this is fanatical but he said well the random writing Pentecostal time we just stepped right in he believed in tongues he believed in interpretations he believed in healing so it was just God stepping right up the line amen one of those Pentecostals right where they needed to be getting them anointing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right the truth was speaking in tongues and the truth even even when it fell under that Pentecost it fell on trinitarians they didn't have it all right that's right but they had some things right but then you come up with the one in this group then you got brother Adam teaching what going back and teaching us what Paul said right so we look and see they're going to write them he comes in he preaches his messaging he tells the people well I don't understand you're not getting it but remember in the 13th book brother I said this messenger Malachi 4 has come to do two things yes amen I can quote it without even looking at it amen amen right first to turn the hearts of the children back children family babies Pentecostal babies back to the face of the father yes right back to water baptism correct back to where there's no eternal hell back before there's not but you see what it was it was he was bringing us back to that right but then he said it was going to do two things yes amen the second one is remember the book was closed back in about 80 30 or 80 20 something Jesus close the foot right I read to the scripture he closed the club handed it back to the preacher right now Revelation 10 7. they say man putting the book open again and precious words 1100 determine proceeded out of his mind amen amen and now we're working this day description all right right amen not a day 24-hour day remember remember thank God for a prophet one more time to everybody you want to make sure y'all ain't left until somebody else come back in but you look and see that John was in the spirit on the Lord's day brother said that wasn't a 24-hour day when I say Lord bless this day I mean the day of the Bride knock your 24-hour day the day of the Bride the day when we're supposed to manifest not just the Son of God but the son of man amen we're to be the preacher amen but don't we believe the promising amen praise Revelation 5 said we did yes sir all right made us Kings and Priests amen so somebody hate amen praise God can you read this real quick little close on here Brothers 1955 Jesus had the greatest anointing of any man now listen that great anointing was on him to preach the gospel right what came on him at the River Jordan was an anointing for a Ministry of three and a half years because that's why what's happening now we're under the son of man Ministry so we're getting that same three and a half year message that Jesus preached but now remember there was a time that that anointing came off of Jesus yes sir amen Jesus had the greatest anoint of any man ever on earth is that right one day he went into the temple they gave him the scroll if he picked it up he sat down and read Isaiah where it said the spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year and so forth brother I'm talking the Jubilee year yeah let me put that in there that's right and he took the swallow and handed it back and sat down and pressed his words received from his mouth the greatest anointed it was ever on here oh man man all back to this work no ways ain't anointing all right I'm gonna read that one more time yes oh sometimes we meant to this get noise confused with an awning amen well you couldn't get him at this shout out the matter right no no no you're wrong about that nobody's ain't anointed no no I've seen a lot of noise and not faith enough to cure toothache you've got to come silently to the father you've got to know exactly where you stand right Amen brother why am I picking people so talked about 1956 some people get the wrong impression of what the anointing is did you ever think of that what was the greatest anointing that ever was to anyone what did they do when they had the anointed the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ we have the spirit by measure he had it without measurement right all right and one day here and into the temple and you pick up the scroll and he read the spirit of God is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the acceptable year buying up the broken heart heal the sick give us out to the wife now we would think if such anointing was on him there had been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him that we would want to run all over the building screaming and hollering but the Bible said he put the scroll down sit down all right here's the thing that's what he done under that point the anointing is not emotion that's right the anointing is supreme power amen yes now he gave us a comma like knowing exactly what and how it is Amen period amen sir amen thank you and that looks well real quick I think 65 rocking the sun brother I intelligence we know the Spirit came on him on the rip Jordan yes minority for a Ministry which was a Ministry of the son of man he preached the perfect word of God he preached every Doctrine true diagram there ever was you know they got all the Falcons out of it but he preached all through God yes sir all right if I win so now look 1965. I noticed this quickening power zodium musicians come on bring the word the mind that was in Christ was in you then I'll try to show you that when you raise when God raised Jesus from the dead he raised you also right right amen bro you believe that man I do go vacation 1.6 man was inside of that man all right all bottled up all encapsulated you know if you take that you take a pill I don't have a vitamin I cook my money to go but the is the Bible in the outside that's just skeleton that when he gets into your stomach it goes off right that ought to be a sermon it's not going to believe the medicines on the inside and also equipping to life with him you are now quickened to life although when you were but an attribute in this boss but God saw all in him at the finish so now he's saying at the Finish yes it's not the thing amen okay it's an advantage what are you talking about us now yeah that's right look he said the spirit left him in the Garden of Gethsemane he had to die a man yes sir that's right yes sir God all right all right so watch Spirit left him the spirit of the screen I have your minister amen where they could not kill him they tried to throw him off a cliff they tried to Stone him they did everything in the world they could try to kill him trapped him trap him in his own words trap him in the scripture they tried for three and a half years you think you got issue they hated it they hated him so much that put you on a cross yet they hated him so much they hung him on the cross remember they didn't hang him for the good work she did no sir I tried they hung him for saying he was gone amen right yeah so the spirit left him in the garden you got sent when he had to die remember friends you didn't have to that was God God anointed that flesh which was human flesh if Peter went up there as God he'd have never died that time that kind of death can't kill God that's right but he didn't have to but remember he went there with you yes in him and amen amen right well thank you all these kids bottled up and encapsulated in that flesh couldn't get out but on that cross when he died amen you know the Bible tells us that your names are engraved where and the moment will land that's right those Joel when they drove that nail through that pond it went through my name you can say it went through yours if you want to but he went through mine I'll make them perfect I'm the one that put him up there I'm the one that hung him up there so he put that nail they put that nail right through my name but remember he went there with you and him but I never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon that body of Christ we saw both male and female amen all redeemed in that one body they are one same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride yes amen so remember Pentecost was a bird then anointing cat the book was closed there was a three and a half year Ministry to come for the final comes and and I I just believed that when he went in Arizona over there and the cloud that they hate so much for I'm glad they hate it that's okay I'm glad they hate it I love it all right well that cloud is a symbol to me

backside so don't be retrieved let's sing a song God bless you God's contributes this last week for the original alive [Music] everything [Music] start looking at me [Music] tomorrow afternoon [Music] it's Christmas amen how do we thank God for his precious word and that word that we have become the Lord made flesh yet we certainly thank you brother when I'm going to try to preach behind you it's the same word the same Holy Ghost yeah same Holy Ghost yes sir when we see these things that were spoken today and have watched the word grow in our lives and that word as we see have come to the Capstone and we've been speaking on the Perfection of the garage and that's let me just quote this because I love it and the message there invisible Union of the pride wrote around and said that same Holy Ghost the quickening power that Jesus was all the quickening now right he said that same quickly power that raised up Jesus when he raised up Jesus he hath already raised you up with him and seated you and I have moved places and in Christ Jesus so we're only catching up to what he has already made us thank you for that [Applause] take the seats for just a moment don't worry I'm not going to stop stop reaching but I tell you what that's what we want to leave with that word resonating with who you are right especially in this hour Satan has so marred the identification of people they don't know who they are what they are and why they're here what's their purpose and our precious Brothers speaking on that anointing with purpose how thankful we are that the purpose of God afford knowledge of God that operates in our lives bringing us to a reality that we're not two brothers or they'll make them two every time but it's Christ in you the whole thing yeah okay so by the way we really appreciate that that's good thank you really surrendering to the Lord and speaking those great words of truth these words has transforming us into his image that we're not looking for another person or another man but the word the Christ that's in you is the Apostle Paul speaking to the Hebrews he tried to get them to see the great Perfection that moved from Judaism and he talks about Jesus Christ he said how Moses built his house and Christ built his house whose house were you but then he goes on to the ministry of Manchester that and he begins to talk about the Perfection of who you are and so when we see as brother Wade ministered today showing us the great anointing that came upon the Lord it did not come and go it did not come and go the brother opened our eyes to the different anointings the Old Testament anointing the false anointing but the anointed broad that you are that's I'm coming and going that's not flipping the switch on and off that's not something dollar of God one day and night we're thankful we've recognized who we are and we're thankful that this day this scripture is fulfilled what a wonderful what a wonderful three days the Lord has given all of us and once again we want to thank you all for coming up from Georgia from Lula and brother and simondale our wonderful Pastor there we want to thank him and his lovely wife for making that sacrifice and trip to come up right and all of you is coming up and just seeing the smiles on your face the fellowship and with your brothers and sisters and we appreciate that so much the group here I can't say enough for Sister Kate Peterson I tell you what she's just 24 7 working there with her husband back there and just working to get all these things together I told my wife I said we're going to have to pay for them a vacation yeah as I go somewhere for a long time and you don't even answer the phone if you don't have to that's right but I I we thank this lovely group here in Irwin your Association how everybody was so excited brother not just talking about the lead but we've been praying for weeks and months for this time and so we don't want to let this light water off our ducks back we're going to hold to that word brother Joel Brown came and poured out his soul last night and encouraged all of us spoke to all of us and we heard that word even we have some I wouldn't dare mention that went home families that went home last night pray for their parents again pray for these to me and pray for brother away David tell them we're praying for brother away I thought I wouldn't care to this lovely family family is and I I thank God that's the kind of caliber we have with these Believers community and so when we see that and and seeing uh precious brother Louise and his wonderful minister in the family that he has and brother Aaron here brother Bob went back last night uh you know the brother away these wonderful ministers have come up and been a great blessing to the church here you know oh with open arms and the Believers or so they're feeding you know as a as a minister when you see your people feeding on the word and not not just a bunch of nonsense but really feeding on the Subscribe and when we have these kind of Ministries that y'all have sent up it's just has been a fair and fair you know it's the hand of God let me say this real quick and then we'll prepare to leaving us and I you know you you as a minister and that's a Believer you you watch the hand of God in your life you watch that and then just however God deals with you been a Christian about 30 years and for me to just wake up to I don't know how God deals I don't know how you can please come on I mean I know something about being a Christian you know it's a shame like you said this morning it's a shame when we come to church and we don't grow anymore it's a shame when we've been reading from second Peter 3 18 where Peter says grow in the grace and the knowledge as Jesus did right and so we're coming to church but we're you know two months later we hadn't learned we hadn't received when Jesus said come unto me and learn with me like that that's just words coming to me and learn that thing and so you know just like you brother Wayne just like you ministers we challenge these Believers because this is who they are this is what they are and that's the purpose and anointing and so you know when when we saw the Lord began to move and when brother Aaron coming up the living his cell and then wrote Bob and brother Louise and then I began to watch because I don't just have anyone come up to this pool driveway I'm beginning to watch that and I thought Lord are you doing something not just having another minister in it or we love those things we love those things God has a powerful Ministry and so I began to see the hand of the Lord move and so when brother Bob and Brother Joseph was here the last time I stood behind this Pulpit we had a wonderful time of Fellowship the word went forward am I doing and I said you know you all will you'll have to go and bring your young people and bring people up from Louisville and so you know I I was catching the vision I wasn't catching in what God was doing and the brothers came to her brother Louise different ones came through and then so many weeks later I was speaking with brother Wayne he said hey you know let's be praying about this then I I realized that the vision that brother Wade had he'd actually had outreached me because I was looking for this too but his vision outreached me when he said we'll bring the group up and I thought right then oh God this is your ability my vision like I woke up just here brother Wade's mentioned it out reached mine God bringing these things together and so how thankful we are it's not about a man that's broken in the weeks to the seals this hasn't been a man and this hasn't been a name right and I can say what you want to but be careful yeah what you say yeah there's a hasn't been a man that's been y'all and so all of your lives your families your children your anticipation has been precious and these things have been in the fellowship of Brotherly kindness and the agape love and so we appreciate them I'm not good at these things but we're gonna ask your brother Wayne to come back and uh or revolution on here now and what we're going to do we're going to he's going to say a few words and we'll get together we'll head up to the farmers Farmers golfers restaurant this is about 30-40 minutes from the year they're expecting you all to come we're going to have Fellowship lots of good food and I feel like the spiritual food that we had today though all right trying to be thanked the Lord for that so we love you all so much and so dear I have to do this every time bro because I love Brother Joseph Canada it's Buzz a friend of mine I love him and we've been through so much and then my wife was talking about him last night thank

personally I know too many of you amen this is like like for the White's head he's just a humble meat person and one of the things that I always brag about brother aren't great is that whenever you're talking with him he always makes you feel important you don't care what he has to say he wants to know what you have to say man that's what I've always appreciated about that laundry so uh so I'll keep saying that but I don't do it because I I love that part thanks amen so let's just buy our heads in here our heavenly father we thank you once again for the opportunity that we had to have heard your word Lord Jesus truly say Lord God that it's been good father to be in the house of God lord to worship with these Believers father of light precious Faith Lord and Lord we ask Lord that you
