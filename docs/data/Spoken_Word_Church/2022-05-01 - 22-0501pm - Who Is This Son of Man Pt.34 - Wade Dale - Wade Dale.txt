got a lot going on i like it that's what i live for i live for that john 1 verse 1. let's pray lord thank you for this day that you give us more than anything thank you for calvary thank you for dying for our sins lord that we can stand today and be the purchased possession of your blood knowing full well that we could die for others and that would be a noble cause but lord we can't die for others and save them but lord you can and you did and you died for each one of our sins lord now today we lay those sins lord let the blood just wash them completely away lord thank you for justification thank you for revelation of justification a revelation of sanctification and a true revelation of the baptism of the holy ghost father we pray that you'll be with each one here today that sick be with the ones that are not here lord that are sick be with the ones on the highways traveling bless each one thank you for the new ones that are coming in lord we pray that they will they will be treated well as brothers and sisters in christ father we thank you for the people that are here today lord we've seen lord as we were talking about this morning we've seen children grow from babies all the way up to adults in natural life now we're looking to do that in the spiritual life take newborn babes as paul says and lord try our best to help them up that statue of a perfect man we all need growth we all need more from you lord there won't be a day until the day of the change of the body we will not have a day where we won't need you lord to pull us up that statue of a perfect man lord we thank you for those things lord thank you for putting us in this position lord to speak to the purchase of your blood and now i pray that they will lord get revelation today and get inspiration lord for the next week and the weeks to come in jesus name we pray amen john 1 1. for i reckon in the beginning was the word where it was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seen in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word we'll read romans 8 but remember the word was made flesh and dwelt among us 2 000 years ago now the word has made flesh hey lois i was praying you'd be here today so god bless you good to have you with us i'm not gonna ask you where your brother's at where's your brother you know what i'm talking about brother sister lois and uh and brother lauren uh come to me i love that mom and dad the mom is the one that that made all these those of you that have these own that says buy his stripes i am healed i shall not die but live and declare the words when i have a bad day i look at that well there is lauren rachel is not that funny sister she about dropped her head off backwards laughing i'm getting old okay no i'm not getting old i am there good to see you man i pray for both of you to be here today so we we're going to pray you're here how many of us are going to pray that they get here every single okay hallelujah thank you see you there and you got on a certain time wow dude miracles happen for our reckons that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory we shall be revealed enough so it really doesn't matter what we go through trials and tribulations we're going to have them they're going to be there like i said before when you become a christian your grass doesn't quit growing your bills doesn't quit coming into the mailbox i know because i deliver them yep y'alls especially but all that doesn't stop it's not that you live in this flowery bed of ease but what you have you have a typos you have a spiritual rudder that when that boat when that wind starts blowing that rudder turns and you know you can turn yourself into the wind and you can make it through problems will not go away but how to handle them is what god is wanting to give you he gives you a way to handle your problems and your issues everyday life by the baptism of holy ghost that's why brother brown said the holy ghost receiving the baptism of the holy ghost is the most important thing in your life and that's what we're talking about now let there's not a there's a teaching in the message that you got to go all the way up here before you get the holy ghost well i you can't get you cannot get the character of god without having part of the character of god in you already that's just to me that's just i don't say the word stupid anymore that did so it was stupid it really is i mean you look and you go how in the world if the bible tells us that then i'll read it in a minute where the bible says we can't even call jesus to christ we can't even call his name without the holy ghost because you just jesus listen jesus christ without the new birth is just like robert doherty it has no meaning behind it i don't say you know what you know what i mean thank you brother that's maturity a young kid would be going what you mean ain't nothing but you understand what i'm saying you got the baptism of the holy ghost that puts you in christ and that puts his nature inside of you so so now you have the ability to live the life that jesus christ lived aren't we in the aren't we in the dispensation of the son of man amen we're in the dispensation of the son of man and like i said before we can't go back and get more one more time we can't be in the son of man revelation and say well that's not for me and then you drop back to the son of god revelation which is the church ages which is the new birth which is somewhat of growth development but not full maturity all right so you can't go then all the way back here once you've got here because you're moving backwards you got to move forward and listen there's a way to do it there's a way to get to that next step there's a way to get to that that using that gps gps god's positioning system or god's predestinated seed you can get that gps and that gps is going to take you to the headstone because that's the requirement of this day not a requirement of just saying god sent a prophet and we're good and we're okay and and we just we're gonna fill the church up with people and and we're just gonna all you know be okay we'll have birthday parties and and we'll do this and we'll take a minute once a month and no that's not what god wants god wants you to be a moving living breathing instrumentality of itself that only the world will see god through you there is no way they're going to see god and how they're going to see god through you if you don't have god in you like i said how you go you got you don't have a clue what virtue knowledge temperature and godless brother kindness is without the basis or foundation of having the new birth because remember jesus himself was god almighty in human flesh but he learned by the things he suffered when he got into that flesh right but remember he was a son already hello he was a son already then he grew he only did that what the father shall well what the father show him virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brethren kindness that's what god showed him in his life i only do that what the father boy that'd be a good idea wouldn't it if you could do only what god tells you to do sometimes we fight for days to do what he to not do what he said i said to not do what he said amen sometimes we fight our we fight our way and stuff where you're supposed to just be going okay god i'll do it don't worry but you know what we're hard-headed so romans 8 verse 8 well maybe not y'all are not but i am just pray for me for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creation or the whole creation waited for the manifestation of the sons of god listen it's good it's good to preach that you need the holy ghost it's good to preach that you get all these virtues and god's working like peter and and and paul and the people get healed in your shadow amen but unless you manifest this part yes that's not the call of this age the call they say is to manifest jesus christ himself in your human flesh that's the mandate that we have to live under you say well that's really hard listen i'm telling you one more time you say you read the bible or you read the prophet's message and you said you say well i just said that a different way because that's kind of hard to understand now why are you trying to change god's mind god saw somebody get this god saw somebody get something out of those 1100 sermons and that's the way he said it he don't have to say it 10 different ways he says it one way i'm like brother brown and brother brown said if i was god i'd just say forget it but no he's long suffering he wrote the bible he gave us 1100 sermons and he gave us the holy ghost which is the man that wrote the sermons and the man that wrote the bible he's inside of you today so he gives that to you but what do we do we clamp down on it remember read the conservation imagination that's our problem that's where the clamp is everybody with me all right so we're waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god let's look at number one where brother ryan says teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly have be able to have faith faith now that's not faith at the new birth that's faith to continue on because what now look i don't want to say only but the only thing the new birth does is it puts you in the body then you have to know find your position all right i'm in the body now let me find my position listen the day i got born again god didn't say you're going to be a preacher and you're going to do this and you no he lets you go and figure things out he lets you go and deal with things he lets you have trials and tribulations and troubles and move from church to church and somebody hurts your feelings and somebody did this and somebody did that and you found this and you quit that and you see what i'm talking about but positionally faith to be positionally placed has to come by teaching somebody must teach us how to get to these things because listen we were born confused we are confused until the new birth and that doesn't do away with the confusion amen and you say i'm sick rebecca's laughing but you do that i mean but you then you say well well then i can't make it no keep moving keep moving you got a position to get to i like i like what brother chad lamb said i was watching him the other day and he said look you can't if you get the new birth you can't sin enough to be lost but you still got once you go up a statue of perfect man you're gonna have problems but you'll never lose that foundation [Music] that's where you got to start jerubable lay the foundation and then build the building lay the foundation and then build the building lay the foundation god and then as you go up the statue of perfect man if you see that where's boyd where i thought she was up here oh oh there must be some ghost sitting up here god bless you brother he had a temper are you okay we're good he had a temper i saw it a couple times but that's okay he saw stuff in me but i'm talking about he have to he don't have that temper anymore right the lord i know now look that proves two things number one he's a child of god because the devil would never take away that he loves temper he loves to get you confused he loves to stir you up even in your new birth he still likes to stir you up hey man like when y'all start falling asleep that stirs me up nope just kidding you're not yeah i'm awake i'm awake i'm awake we do it jericho march but we can't get past the wall over there it'd be enough it'd be like this and everybody fall over each other especially older ones they'd fall over each other but brother boyd had a problem he knew that i know what problems i have i'm going this way i know what problems i have it's not my business what problems he has i tr we try to help because being a minister you try to help you you see things and then you through the holy ghost you try to help but he's got to work it out himself but now when you see it's gone when you see it's gone every one of you you say well i've never had a temper they some of it people never really never had a temper sister clay did you ever have a temper well let me ask tony tony did your mom ever have a temper he's smiling that's that's sometimes tough but not like you used to be boy it still tries to raise up some time doesn't it because that's your memory reason conscious affectionate imagination that's not your new birth what proves in your birth is that things gone like it was amen okay then hold on to that yes don't don't go through life and say well i don't know if i'm born again or not confess you are even though maybe you're not confession god goes by your confession confess these things but you used to not turn over desk he told me one time in a in a plant that's pretty tough to turn a big old desk over but you don't do that no more you know what he'd do he'll pray for the people that he was mad at instead of wanting to curse him you're praying for him that's the difference to me that shows you there's growth that shows me that god has given you a foundation called a new birth and then now he's what he's chopping he's chopping big chunks at one time sometimes big chunks hurts bad but then now you got to get to a time to where brother brown talks about the masterpiece where you get to a time where you're not knocking places pieces off this big you knock them off this big then you get to the finished product and all you're doing is sanding you're getting the detail i believe now a lot of people are getting the detail a lot of people are still like me just a big old chunk i'm trying i'm on the keto diet so i'm not going to be thank christian wherever he's at he said i filled up the whole screen patience virtue um a lot of temperance and the knowledge that he ain't got no sense but look i'm trying to make it so simple because we make it so hard to be perfect according to like i said this morning the way we see perfect perfect is you get up every morning and your teeth already brushed your clothes are already ironed get out of that fantasy but that's what we think as human beings and then i'm not gonna ever have a wreck in a car if i get bored again i'm not gonna with brother gary i'm not gonna hit my finger with a hammer even if you use a hammer anymore use a nail gun shoot em through your fingers like i did that's our thinking but thank god for a prophet thank god for a prophet that told us cloudy days are not a sign that you're having a bad day and that god don't like you that's right but he says sunny beautiful days when you walk outside and say man this great day to be a christian guess what the devil's in the bushes he's going as soon as he walks out to that car i'm gonna make sure it don't crank that ever happened to anybody sure it has that's our mentality though so let's keep reading hebrews 6 1. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on into what perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance excuse me from dead works and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism a laying on of hands and the resurrection of the dead of eternal judgment this will we do if god permit now listen god didn't permit certain people in certain ages to go so far because they didn't have the word to do it with you and i don't have that excuse all forward full all the way up to the capstone we we there's a way to get there like i said before why try to change god's word why try to change the prophet of god's word to fit our slowness or our excuses we got to conform to him he's the potter with the clay all right he's the one we got to listen to not what we think supposed to be we listen to what he says in the word of god and it does not change for me or you either one let's go into perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance now look not laying again the when we start the new birth you say well brother wait you don't have to repent yeah you repent every day but you don't have to repent like you did before we'll talk about that go ahead and pull the uh pull the new chart and chart number two up and we'll look at that just for a minute which will be the coming to the new birth all right but you got to come to perfection and remember i'll read this while they're pulling that up the greek lexicon said this means a full age brought to its end i like that finished wanting nothing necessary to completeness nothing perfect that which is perfect consummate human integrity and virtue of men full grown adult of full age mature now look that's not this picture that's your foundation you're not as complete as you're going to be right here in your soul you are but remember that soul is always moving that soul is always doing something it's really a paradox that when you're laying asleep at night and you're having an awful dream there's a holy ghost inside of you that's not having that dream when you have that nasty thought in your mind y'all never had those before i have the holy ghost didn't do that when you have a dream you're like where did that come from that was from your memory reason conscious affection imagination that is not from your soul that is satan bombarding you from this angle not coming from the inside this way amen but now remember god does use dreams now what does god use dreams with the holy ghost is inside of you to tell you a dream or to give you a prophecy or to prophesy to someone that comes from the new birth but you have to really be careful because remember brother brown met those two guys one of them had a new birth one of them didn't living with another woman and he was interpreting tongues that's why we read that this morning everybody puts emphasis on speaking in tongues paul said i'd rather say five words with wisdom than to speak ten thousand words in another tongue ten thousand y'all couldn't know well maybe you could you could all if we all start speaking in tongues it might be ten thousand words in an hour but five words is what he said five words give me five words that's full of grace give me five words that's full of the holy ghost give me five words that will help me up the statue of perfect man rather than all that speaking in tongues i'm just telling you what paul said all right we take some of these gifts and we think man i wish i had them i wish we did have the gifts because the gift keeps us clean and we do but now listen you say well well there there's nine of them and we pick two the two bottom ones speaking in tongues and interpretation there's wisdom there's faith knowledge all those different gifts that god's given listen those are gifts that god give us a full age brought to its end and finished wanting nothing necessary to completeness human integrity and virtue full grown adult full age mature let's look at the next one is a finisher a perfector one who has in his own person raised faith amen now listen where'd y'all tell me to stand sorry this is perfect faith in a minute in a minute um portion everybody with me because there's not an imperfect faith in god because when you receive perfect faith that's the new birth because brother brown said who are these people said they're your converts he said what are they doing here he said they all have faith perfect faith everybody won't know what perfect faith is perfect facing new birth but perfect faith is not all you need because it keeps telling you to keep going up it says look the one who has in his own person raised faith to its perfection and so set before us the highest example of faith listen jesus had the highest example of faith because he was faith but he still had to die he still had to go through trials they hated him amen they hated him and called him the king of devils they didn't call him the messiah only a few very few people called him who he really was and they didn't know who he was flesh and blood does not reveal this to you but my father which is in heaven in other words god put the words in peter's mouth god put the words in peter's mouth because it wasn't a revelation because listen if it was a revelation to peter he'd have had to have the new birth and he wouldn't have run all over the place and cut cut ears off and cursed god three times and run away from him and he went fishing right yeah i go fishing whoever that was preaching the other day you know you see somebody raised from the dead would you go fishing would you no i'd follow that person because he got something i ain't got i would say i go fishing you know what they didn't have a true revelation but i believe when the day of pentecost come peter was the spokesman but i believe peter inside his psyche inside his brain he's like you idiot yeah there's what's supposed to be bringing you life and you messed it up he called you satan right get behind me satan that wasn't peter he's talking about he was talking about what's inside of peter because the new birth wasn't inside of peter right they were under the old testament paradise paradise taught type if they died they went into paradise they didn't have the new birth we had an anointing we had an anointing go preach the gospel but when the day of pentecost come peter said this is that he goes back into scripture and he brings it all the way down and he said man y'all killed this man y'all killed the messiah and what peter do he goes out and he preaches and he gives his life for the gospel we need to lay our life down for this gospel this holy ghost gospel the only way that people are going to get us to me and you so let's go to first corinthians 14. the next one just leave that up there because we're going to start that in just a second i'm going to skip over a couple of these things be not children brethren yeah in the church i'd rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue brethren be not children in how being in malice be your children in other words playful malicious mean do that you're a child you're gonna do that but i want you to be a man but in understanding be men and the law it's written with men of other tongues and other lips will i speak to these people he's talking about the bible yet for all that will not hear me saith the lord they're not going to wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not wow how about that everybody wants speaking in tongues that's to the unbeliever i'm reading the bible everybody believes the bible all right right group but to them that believe not but prophesying service not for them that believeth not but for them which believe we're all believers right then brother brown continues on he's talking about revelation of jesus christ he said i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study everybody with me ordinaries not it will not take ordinary study that's our problem we study the ordinary say the prayer do the hail mary's preachers save my kids i can't do it with them you help you no daddy said you have them you raise them we'll help you all we can but it starts at home parental delinquency the prophet of god said everybody believe brother brown was the prophet then he said it was parental delinquency okay all righty let's don't blame our kids a lot let's blame ourselves i don't know where that was but that was a freebie bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real now who wants the bible to be real i do i want it to be real and the only way it's going to be real it's not going to be these pain it's not going to be these words are going to start doing this no the words are going to go into you and then you're going to start making it do this amen you're going to start moving it will take one i'm sorry it is going to take the operation of the holy ghost all right if it's going to take the operation of the holy ghost how in the heavenly days are you going to have these operate and work if you don't have the holy ghost we'll get to that where the placing of that is we understand that but we got to get to a point here just a second it will take a special class of people it can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from god it will require supernatural instruction not just a student companion verse with verse that's right though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear that's why teaching places you in the body you don't have to be taught to be born again you have to be taught to grow you have to be taught to be positionally placed that's why you must play all you want to and i do not care who hears this you can play past plus press i can't even say it you can press play all you want to you might get the new birth but you will not come to adoption by listening to tapes only never will boy i thought you got mad at me left you're good you're good okay all right he's okay now he went and prayed got it over with you couldn't say that to you you know that don't you you just couldn't do that we've all come a long way but i've seen brother boyd come a long way too a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear that's why you can preach a good sugar-tipped sermon and everybody says glory hallelujah that was wonderful well what'd he say i don't know sounded good i got this feeling like daddy always said you want a feeling i'll get you some ice cubes and put them down your back i'll guarantee you'll shout your way all the way down that hall all right trying to get that out of you out of your shirt but five words sit down and hear five words of good teaching then all that shouting and running and all that other stuff that they do that's okay as you can do that let me tell you something there was one time a man called david that he was the apple of god's eye he danced until he showed his underwear under parts right remember his wife said shame on you you went out there and everybody in the whole the whole kingdom saw everything about you you know what david say i'm sorry what didn't mean to do that no he said if you hang around a little bit longer woman you hang around a little bit once and i'm going to show a lot more because that was god amen that i was dancing too that was god that was showing me what was going on because here come the ark here comes the word of god to go back in this place listen once you see the word of god come in this place it'll make you happy it'll make you say hey that's me we can handle it folks the pressure the pressure of this age the pressure of what we need to listen to and learn and it's the pressure but brother brown said we were built to handle the pressure you know why we're built to handle the pressure god saw we'd be built to handle the pressure god thought we'd be eagles he knew we would fly oh that's brother branham no wait a minute hold on just a minute the line ox man and eagle was not william branham he had an eagle anointing right be it prophetic but he told us i just read you we're prophetic people ourself but we can't go as high as a prophet i well guess what he preached us to a place he said that rapturing faith lays in these tapes and books amen and what it takes is is mother eagle to pull those big nuggets out those big pieces of meat chews them up into little pieces of meat and i wish we could shove it down your throat but we can't we have to just drop it in there every once in a while because we don't want to choke you but you know what once that happens though and you get big enough you get your own wings you always had them you had them at the birth i just thought of that you had it at the birth you had the two wings at the birth you didn't know how to use them but mama eagle kept feeding you apostles prophets pastor teacher evangelist bible study sunday school preachers coming in talking about the word of god and guess what all of a sudden you go hmm that's a rabbit and all you see is is a piece of steak and then what do you do you go get it then you can eat it yourself not doing away with the file foam ministry but there's a time coming to where you're going to have to get this stuff whether we're around you or not you got to come to maturity i like what brother dale said about brother cauley a long time ago what'd he say brother james he said i want to get packed in you enough to where if something happens to me you'll have enough to make it that's what i want pack it in enough get that in the storehouse she's oh no that's a building nice you yeah the storehouse is you store the food up and guess what lock the door lock the door because the devil sure wants to steal that away from you that's his job but he's not greater than the one inside of us they ought to write a song about that greater is he that's in you than he is in the world a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear then we read where there's a mystery and a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation you know you get a revelation of of one true and living god leave that alone you get a revelation of one true living god right but is that it is that it you just say oh well you know what the bible says the devil believes in one god and trembles so you got to go on you got to get a supernatural element of that that it's inside of you it's in you it's not in the devil or he'd be your brother that's what he can't understand about me and you he can't understand why boy did he take the same devil send that same um horrible attitude demon and still going let me back in can't get in sealed out cause god is sealed in at me by again seven devils worse than the ones that came the fir got thrown out the first time can't get back in can't get back in because you're sealed but do we stop there nope we're going to get to the place to where this world as brother brown said he said he said death will come up your arm and you'll just wipe it off like dust that's real scary you know why it's scary because satan made it scary god didn't make death scary no satan made this scary and that little brother brown said that one little little sting that little little twang of death but when god sent him over to the other side what'd he say he said that's gone why do we fear death if that's what he's going to send me to even if we have to go by the grave even if we have to go over to the other side the sixth dimension so what somebody better bring me back i'm not staying over there but god's to put somebody in this dimension that's going to bring all that back a supernatural group of people a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation so we get the revelation of of serpent seed sex in the garden oh boy that's it let's just go home that just starts it that tells me that i was the one that caused all that my mama was eve boy it gets quiet because y'all know i'm feeling talk about marriage and divorce i know you all everybody swiveling up got the head down brother brown said you were born between satan and eve all right amen hello that's exactly what he said you were born between satan and eve you were born dead amen no life in you at all you had predestination you had the foreknowledge of god that knew you'd come to it but you weren't sitting there with it i'm going to tell you one more time the things i did when i was in the world god was nowhere to be seen inside of me like i said this morning i didn't care i'm sorry and until you're born again you're the same way you just go do your own thing but when god by foreknowledge knew that you would come to a point where you would just hate it i don't want this no more i don't want this no more and what does god do he tugs that little tug what's he tugging you those who he's justified he's already glorified because if you accept that tug and it's the right one it's going to take you to the headstone those who he's justified he is already glorified but there's a journey in his mind it's already finished but on this earth we have to go through it that's why the statue of perfect man is so important because i believe people a lot of people in the message they preach this and then like i've always said right here there's a red letter day on the calendar and god's got an x you know how if you got something important on the calendar you or you got those people that are in prison and they got the calendars or you see on the wall where they keep exiting the days off until they get out of prison they know exactly what day now listen god knows exactly what day but it's not because what he chose he saw someone come to maturity come to maturity enough to stand and say death you have no hold on me death you have no hold on paul peter irenaeus martin luther columba and all those people that died under their ages they're waiting on me and you william branham is waiting on me and you to fulfill what he already said listen he does not have to come back and tell us another thing that's garbage you know what that's laziness that's laziness i'm waiting on somebody you know what i thought brother brown said god's waiting on you if i believe bro brown was the prophet right okay got the right group god's waiting on you to fulfill what he's already said don't have to have a prophet come back there's nowhere in the world a prophet ever came back and and perfected a group of people amen show me one even jesus didn't at that moment he said i must go away and then i'll come back in the holy ghost and i'm going to perfect you the people the people god wants a mini-member bride he don't want to just deal with one person he dealt with one person then brother branham we know that and and god forbid that we ever from this pulpit ever degrade what the prophet brought ever because there's no man born of a woman greater than william man branham with sex you understand what i mean because jesus was born but outside of jesus christ brother branham was right there all right but he's not the only one he didn't preach i i mean me he preached you you bride you you're gonna come to this you're going to do this god's going to do it through a group of people the bride will be the fullness of the godhead bodily the bride will be the son of man he was pushing all that glory to how many of us in the wedding ugly bunch of us men standing up here like this right here we got our suits on we about as goofy as all get out and we got a suit on it don't fit and you and your your your event coordinator said you got to wear these colors and you're going i need some jeans and a t-shirt whole crowd though it's wedding day the tension the excitement for the groom for the groom no they do not care if he's naked probably so that's what i got in trouble doing it where's jeffrey they're not here okay when jeffrey got married he was standing up beside me and he was doing this he was up as a some of y'all were there at the first methodist church and he was just he's doing this and i grabbed a hold of him i said look man i said just just put in your mind that all these people are naked but the problem was they had turned my microphone on [Laughter] some of our people that remained nameless had already turned the mic on so the whole crowd heard it but were they there for jeffrey no no he's just an accessory if he's here he knows he knows i'm just talking oh he's just an accessory but you know what god god showed us that in type though we you know who th listen this is the head this is the breadwinner this is the what the protector this is the guy that's going to protect this bride this is a guy that's going to take this bride till death do us part and go into what bring her to himself and they're going to have a honeymoon but before that he really don't want any i'd listen did all y'all want that attention guys no but but i mean as soon as the dum dum dum when i and the doors open what does everybody do everybody stands and turns and looks at the groom and says boy is a good looking guy no they do not care if he's there or not that bride has entered the room she's arrived she's here we have a wedding now she's here and here she comes up the aisle and everybody's going now why weren't they doing that before when mr ugly was standing up here it's her day this is your day it's the bride's day listen god knows who he is god knows he's got to provide for you god knows he's got to give you the things in life that you need and the spiritual things that you need but today the bride is on display the bride is the one that everybody's going to see and everybody's going to say oh how beautiful and and you know the roses and the oh my goodness we were at amy jeffrey's wedding i've never seen so many flowers but what was it for the groom nope it was for the bride the whole day was made for the bride listen today this whole day not just 24-hour day this day that we're living in is made for the bride just for you and then the unveiling the vowels but the unveiling there she is now i pronounce to you today mr and mrs jesus christ they've now come together but they're going to consummate that union we're going to consummate the union when we get the new birth that consummates the union amen shut in with god in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face wow giving you power amen you never had before amen you've given he's given now he's given what he's given everything he's got to that woman till death do we part sickness or health i don't care what happens to you going up that statue of perfect man he knows you're his bride that's right amen amen and like i said before you can fail but you'll never fall amen he knows this god you know you're going to have failures you've not been married 43 years we've had some failures but since the lord got a hold of both of us we've never fell same way with god when you get into this whatever you want to call it the family of god this marriage ceremony god gives you the new birth and what did brother brown say it's him and you in there as persons you've been shut into the holy of holies nobody else can get in there satan can't get into that in around that middle realm of you but you had to get there by process of justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost now what is what is this justification just for a minute let me get off my notes for a second what is justification what is that justification that justification is not the justification where you justify it freely we'll get into that next sunday or wednesday night you're justified freely that's not that justification that justification only chops off your past sins god forgive me i am sorry for what i did and he knows if you are not godly sorrow leads to repentance so he knows and there's many people there's many people in the world that's been justified because god is honored to his word he says i'll he said if you say forgive me of my sins he'll forgive you your sins put them in the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered again but you still got that old nature inside of you and this next day you walk you're going to do the same thing you did that you got forgiven for everybody with me but you're justified if you die along that journey like the thief on the cross god forgive him of his past sins and he was just by the justifier and he went to heaven same way with you but if you keep walking though and you start heaping them things back on you again because the unclean spirit's still there the one that made you angry curse throw somebody out of a window it's still there and it's still on the inside and that nature is attached to your nature and it's controlling you everybody okay with this it's controlling you but then you shed that off and you feel better because that load's been lifted if you really know that god forgive you your sins if you really are sorrowful of what you did listen there's a difference in being sorrowful for what you did and being sorry you got caught big difference that's why the people talk about finding jesus in jail people find jesus in jail because they fix it to go to prison so what's the first thing they do listen what's the first thing you do when you get when you get caught doing something they put you in prison you automatically you cut if you got long hair you cut your hair the lawyer tell you say son take a bath shave all that off your face hide your tattoos we're gonna make you look like a good guy hey man they don't want you don't see them going in for their real good court case not when they're not when they're put in jail but when they come up for their trial they're not in the same look that they don't look the same way they did when they walked in the first time they're all some of them put on three-piece suit had to be gift to them because they never did buy one but but you see what i'm saying you're trying to dress yourself up god knows that but if you're sorrowful and really sorrow godly sorrow leads you to repentance because you're going to continue on that journey god i know this is bothering me smoking donny we good smoking brother only smoke for a long time so did your mama so did a lot of you but even as they come into the church though they were still doing that that's why you have to watch and be careful i was talking to brother last night and what makes me what gets my righteous indignation up is that somebody will come into a congregation and come in and sit down and they'll have bob hair and you know their what do you call them earrings hanging down and first time ever in church first time ever been in church they're soft that may be like brother dick says that's fruit really soft because they number one either in this church usually is if they do come in here like this they supposed to go to that role be under and they found their way into this one but some people come that way though cindy i know she don't mind sandy don't mind cindy your aunt right your aunt no cousin come here and she was an absolute wreck we're not gonna get anywhere but i'm gonna tell this this is life anyway she was an absolute wreck y'all remember i mean she was just on pills right and alcohol no just pills all right well she was i mean pills bad come in with pants short hair she was here for three months i guess maybe and you know you get to looking around and you go ain't nobody wearing pants because brother dale they can get up there and hammer and i'll promise you that that's a good way to run them off let's have some wisdom let's have some knowledge and some temperance and some patience we were the fellowship meet one time brother jt pages and i cannot remember who was preaching but yeah i do actually this woman pentecostal woman comes in and she sits down right here brother jt well that's on this side sits right here i mean her hair is as short as mine she got like a lot fishing lures hanging down off of her ears and he lost his sermon making sure that woman knew that it was wrong to cut your hair he beat her to a pulp she never came back that i know of never saw her again you know what it's not her fault it's that preacher's fault she's brand new do you know what though and i started to tell that preacher because he said i had to hit that that woman come in here and sat down like that and i'm just i just walked off i did not say anything hello i didn't want to bruise any fruit myself but i thought what if that woman the night before had been in a meeting and god had forgive her of all of that sin i believe the prophet of god said somewhere that says sisters if you get the new birth your hair is just as long as the other sister it's just got to have time to grow out so look at that forget the outside appearance preach the word of god to him i was talking to somebody yeah brother isaac in ohio last night i said look if there's a new person comes in now i know sister paul is in the message but you get these that come in that you know you know they're not tell them about one god tell them about water baptism tell them about how god can save their soul not how much they go into hell cause their hair short is mine that's wisdom folks that's wisdom of and dad's never done that cindy sat here for three months and we didn't have to go you need to put on a dress and i think we did one time later on didn't we because we talked to her and said look you know if you gonna start coming and buddy immediately what did she do no earrings she got better got off of the drugs or whatever she got better and took all that off no makeup and we didn't have to sit there and pound on her every week see that's bringing them in slow that's bringing them in and you know what if she just received the new birth she bored again she's my sister oh no she's got to know the seals really everybody don't it's not given to everybody to know that it's just given to some right but so there's a supernatural element i kind of got off despite the revelation what is the supernatural element the supernatural element is not that you got to live this message it's that serpent seed carries all the way from the garden all the way to the body change if you can't see that then you need to go back read it again and it's not sex okay actually it's unclean living with the devil in your mind your thoughts and ideas contrary to god is fornication to god amen that's hard to say but that's what it is it's contrary to any listen anything contrary to god is the devil anything contrary to god is the devil so if you're contrary to god there's some part of you that there's a demon i fight them you fight them but i might fight different ones than you fight but we still fighting them it's like chris brother chris long the conflict between god and satan there is no conflict between god and satan god always wins you're the conflict you're standing in the middle you're either letting this one black dog or this one white dog win the battle listen you don't have white dog black dog in you if you're not born again it's all black dog i'm sorry for the analogy but brother brown used it so it's who you feed the most amen i'll promise you one thing give god a little more attention this week and let's see how sunday or wednesday goes just a little more you don't have to listen you don't got to prostrate yourself on the ground and be drugged by you know be drug by your toenails say hail mary's and put money in a pot no you just got to say god i don't want to do that no more this has hounded me forever i want to lay this and put it in i won't i want to be justified from that i want that thing to be gone and you know what sometimes he'll i used to chew to back him don't do that jim still love me barely she wouldn't kiss me but that was one thing i couldn't get rid of i'm talking about naturally couldn't get rid of just like a cigarette same thing same drug same addict same everything as soon as you got finished eating you want a cigarette right well you wanted to chew tobacco or or dip but when god can't get took me to a place of justification even a justification you say oh mine went away it's a new birth well that's okay but it's supposed to go out the unclean spirit goes out at sanctification i didn't quit dipping when i got born again i got i quit dipping when god took me from justification to sanctification that unclean spirit went out and i didn't let it back in but you know what god chopped that thing off in one day one day i wanted it jim the next day i did listen i had i had skull in every pocket i had the ring right here where you always keep it and you know you can see the ring sorry i'm telling this for truth i had them sitting everywhere just like a drunk's got bottles in every corner you know and got them hit under the pictures and behind the behind the pictures of the kids and i had them laying everywhere that morning when i got up i come to this church right here stood right there well knelt right there and i said god take that away from me i don't want that no more it's nasty it makes your heart race and i mean it's a drug it's a drug just as much as any other drug just man has legalized it i know i'm just telling this for somebody maybe maybe somebody needs this but but uh i just felt clean i felt i felt that that thing is lead lifted so i go back in the next day and you know how your buddies are they got one in their pocket too and it's your brand sorry gina and it's your brand it ain't something you don't like it's the very one you chew because you know what you do every day i'm out of i'm out of debt everybody here's one i got three or four more right here here come on have all your money if you don't the convenience store sure does sell them how you know that aaron okay same devil different name okay but you walk in the next day and everybody's going what's wrong with you where's that ring in your pocket you know the skull ring what can i get dip i said you'll have to get it somewhere else today buddy ain't got any oh you run out here 845 right here you have all you want look yeah that's that seven spirits more worse than the one that got out of you you know they're going here i'll almost put it in your mouth for you if you want me to i had a neighbor one time i'm gonna tell this story i had a neighbor one this was just a few years ago phil um jeff ferguson real good i mean wonderful guy but he dips all the time and i got stung by a wasp i got stung by one you got stung too no i got stung by walls let me tell this story okay i got stuff it was me that was crying i got stung by walton and jerry comes driving up in his old white truck you know and he said what are you doing i put my arm right there i said you got any i knew he did i said you ain't trying to back oh i wanted him to give me something out of the can oh yeah that's exactly what he did what a neighbor he goes here and i'm like i feel better already [Music] so i just mashed it up because tobacco will kill the sting i mean that's just not we just didn't do that for but he's like but that's how that spirit will get you though but you know what first thing you did filled her back out he wasn't gonna waste a good dip no he wasn't but that's how it is with us in our walk though with god there's certain things we can't get rid of and there's certain things we can there's certain things that god knows that if you keep going through your life that's going to hinder you your whole life and then satan will tempt you the next day like i said and he'll be going here you know you'd be go to your desk and sit down and then you know it's like a two for one they they got a pile of them on your desk and you're like i don't need these anymore what what where'd that person go i said he died he died he died god let it die [Applause] and i didn't have a desire for it no more no more didn't even care nothing about it i had probably 50 dollars of that stuff laying around i give it away i just said here i don't want it no more get out of my house now if we'll do that with everything every little thing that bothers us you don't have to be skull it don't have to be alcohol it can be anything but let's try let's try this week so i'm gonna tell you something i'll be real honest with you like i wasn't gonna be honest with you two three weeks ago i got in a fog i hated y'all and y'all hated me yeah i'm you know what i mean lousy wild you will ain't nobody listening everybody's falling asleep nobody's responding we've got to become a bunch of clappers that's okay but i'd rather have a good amen thank you very much clapping is when you do something good at the theater good performance i hope this is not a performance no i'm just saying i hope this is not a performance but i got into a fog a good fog and you know what's the first thing you do when you get in a fog being a the carnality part of me you quit praying you decide not to read your bible that day because it's not going to do you any good because you got this bad attitude these things are going through your head that shouldn't be going through your head i'm just being real those things go through your head and you let them build a case you let them drag you down when the that's that's what brother dale's always said he said look he said if anything's ever bothering you the first thing we do what do we do as human beings we quit church wake up we quit church don't say you disappear and then when you come back you go where were you oh i had a problem well who'd you take it to the world call your best friend susie the drunk the addict no you're supposed to gather around people with the holy ghost because listen the holy ghost people are will help you man our woman amen so you got to fight that here's my point you got to fight that you got to fight that right just like i thought right you got to fight that thing last sunday morning it was a battle i felt like i was a flat tire y'all didn't respond to nothing but you know what i took that all on me not you because it's really easy to put it on you so i studied a little more this week i still did some things i shouldn't have done i'm human being but i took just a little more and said lord lord that part of me i'm having a problem with i can't handle it i'm going to give it to you amen i'm going to give it to you he said give me your burdens and he said even if you have a burden i'll make it light who makes it heavy we do we're the ones that get all this messed up when you just need to that's why i opened up the church a couple of sundays a couple of saturdays ago and listen you don't have to come i'm telling you but the atmosphere we had for those of you that did come it was wonderful amen just a quiet nobody's talking nobody's conversing we're not talking about the ball game we come in here we're playing some soft music and we brother donny was sitting here and i was there on my knees praying and people come in you didn't know i didn't care who was here or not really i mean i do care i wish everybody come but you don't have to but see that clears some of the trash out and that's what we're talking about here we're not talking about you know even you say well do you need to get the holy ghost some might listen you got to fight your way find your way to the new birth i've never seen a birth that was not messy didn't hurt a little bit sisters say amen and it hurt us because y'all was always beating on us for making you have one that's turmoil messi and brother brown said you can have all the white sheets and and the pink walls and the floors is all beautiful but when that birth got finished you had to clean a mess up right regardless you cleaned a mess up well that's what a birth is a birth is a mess you absolutely listen your whole insides are torn out of you that was mine because there's something new came in it's a new birth it's a new thought it's a new idea it's a new feeling okay brother don't go by feelings i don't but if you connect feelings with everything else don't just go on feelings but connect those feelings with being closer to god have more communion with him have more of a have some quiet time come to the church and pray we're going to have those again so we're going to have them where you can come in and just just pray and have have you know some meditation and and get ready for the services coming coming up we're probably going to do that before july when we have our july services we'll probably open up the saturday before and just have a prayer session amen and talk to god when i talk to each other talk to god it's not a time to talk about the sales there's time for that it's not time to talk about daniel 70 weeks that's there's a time for that but it's the time to talk to god say god i got this problem i got this issue i know i'm your child because i wouldn't be here for what i wouldn't be here if i wasn't your child but i got a problem i can't get through with now you know what i'm going to do i'm going to just lay it over on you lord but you better watch it because it may not all turn out the way you want it to turn out amen trials and tribulations are still here but you ask for your children you ask for your some of your mothers and fathers are not in the message and different ones are not in the message you ask for them and then you know what you got to do i like what brother claude weissinger said he said you know what we do he said we give our children to god and then the first time they get into trouble we go oh god take that away from them keep them out of trouble bless them lord no you've done took off all that that god's trying to get them to do you have to just shut up god i give them to you i can't save them you got to save them and you promised me you would because in isaiah says that i'll be there with my offspring i'll be there with my possession and i've got nowhere with this sermon but we'll we'll catch it a little bit more [Applause] sometimes we have to come from the heart but i want to read this one before we do close first corinthians 2 verse 9-14 let's read that we're never going to get away from trials but watch this right here but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him amen but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth searcheth all things it's going to your house it's going to your house searcheth all things yay the deep things of god amen not just of water baptism and of the new birth but the deeper things of god and the only way you're going to get the deeper things of god god's going to give them to you right there he'll choke you you'll choke all of us like meat right please don't be a vegetarian god gave you incisors use them amen thank you but did you start a little cambridge not here i was going to use did you start your baby on me no you started on milk because you don't have no teeth same way with god when god saves you and god gives you the new birth he don't expect you to understand the seal you know but you know what he expects he expects you to want to he expects you to want to do that that desire in there i want more of you to open up to me instead of this being just a boredom place to be for what man know what the things of god of a man look save the spirit of man which this is what i'm telling you about the new birth you can't have the new birth right here because of this scripture right here for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him so if you have the spirit of the devil who do you understand the devil if you have the spirit of god who do you understand god amen pretty one two three simple in them even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god at your new birth you receive the spirit of god all right at the new birth now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god you're in the family you're in the house all you need to do is take what you need which things also we speak not in the word which man's look wisdom you say oh no wisdom that's wisdom that's knowledge right here no man's wisdom is man's wisdom god's wisdom is totally different man's wisdom will get you all messed up which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teaches look comparing spiritual things with spiritual how can you do that without the new birth you're not spiritual yeah you might be spiritual all right but you ain't a holy one you got a spirit on you there's no doubt but it ain't holy until you get the new birth then you get the holy spirit but watch this right here we'll read this and then we'll take communion but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god the natural man the worldly man even the man is in justification and sanctification you can't get the things of god because remember sanctification which we never got to we were talking about a little bit a few minutes ago but that's cleaned and set aside for service not in service not god's not going to use a novice he's not going to use somebody that's sanctified like he would use somebody that's filled with the holy ghost all right now you're working toward it don't ever forget that you're working toward it because it's the work of the holy ghost if you receive the new birth that is the work of the holy ghost now watch for they are foolishness look but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness foolishness unto him foolishness unto god neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned there's no way you can know anything about these godly virtues without having a new birth because you can't discern the next step you can't discern what god wants to do with you without him being the one inside of you you can't do it you're just wandering stars you don't you have no direction like i said before when i received the new birth i went through justification i went through sanctification i can tell you how and when because i told you some of it there but you know when i got the new birth it wasn't a shouting screaming affair i was in a i was in a motor home in kentucky lake malone i'd been listening i think it was maybe may not been brotherdale may have been brother branham i can't remember but i was reading the book and i said god i need we we need to have a meeting this this thing needs to be put together because i don't understand this right here i see this piece and this piece but there's a piece missing well but something just dropped over me like a blanket i raised my hand to god and god's my witness whatever i was studying everything just started doing this coming together oh that's what that's about oh that's why you did that that's what that's for go to this scripture right here oh that's what you're talking about and it's just like a beautiful picture and it all just started coming together i didn't have a shouting fit but i did have an experience it was in the calmness now now listen though if i if you'd have been in another dimension it's where the messiness was because the birth's always a mess my my soul was being burnt listen we don't believe in getting a new soul god don't take your soul out and give you a new one no he burns off that old nature that's in the one you got and then he takes his soul and puts it inside of you vulcanization and that's what he was doing it was burning all that out when he placed that in there and look what went away was the confusion it wasn't the cursing it wasn't the it wasn't the chewing tobacco it wasn't the whatever you want to put in there like i say your laundry list what you have a different one than i do but my laundry list was they had already left me i was in a state of sanctification i was clean and set aside for service i didn't have all that stuff worrying me right then i was worried that i couldn't get the word to fit together and what does the holy ghost do he divinely puts the word together rightly dividing the word of truth so that and and one of the brothers the other day said look if you don't understand if you don't understand the word of god pray because listen the holy ghost can't be confused listen the holy ghost can't confuse you you can confuse you but the holy ghost can't confuse you listen it's like the bible says why would a why would a father if a child is hungry and he comes up to you and says says dad i'm starving to death oh here here's a scorpion chewing out a while or or i need some bread here's a rock that's not god god's gonna give you bread he's going to give you something to eat he's going to direct you to church he's going to direct you to a message he's going to direct you to a scripture in the bible that you can compare yourself with genesis 1 26 would be mine if you don't mind you all know that but see i begin then to have a substance faith that's what i was trying to get to a substance faith what something that god can work on something that god can build on top of but if you don't have that foundation what's he going to build on if a man built on sand remember the seed the four times you know it was on stony ground it was on this ground it was on that ground and the cares of life took this one away and because of the word this one went away and because this one this they didn't grow but now there was one that did there was one so there's a promise there's one piece of dirt everybody takes a finger and do this do this that's the piece of dirt i'm talking about take this piece of dirt and put that seed the word of god the quickened word of god in this man and let it live yes let it bring forth fruit that's what every plant listen every plant that i plant in my garden it watched from the time i put it in the ground it's actually in the pack in the pack right now in my bedroom going let me out i want to produce some corn i want to produce some beans right there's a desire in every one of those seeds but what do you got to do if i leave them in the bedroom inside that seal full pack never will they grow oh they might get a little damp one day and stick a little shoot up and come to church just every once in a while i'm sorry i'm gonna say that come to church just every once in a while and all of a sudden i'm on fire for god two weeks later they're gone no you take that seed and you give it some good teaching this is where you need to go because see when i wanted to learn about my garden i asked my mom and daddy but that was 1960 something gardening i brought it up to updated revelation and i started planting the seed before i put the fertilizer to it and man they just grew like crazy then i put the fertilizer to it see that's not saying anything wrong about the old revelation but the new revelation was this was growing some big plants all right but i got it from youtube what's that where's louise well he's like what's that everybody knows what youtube is okay gardening how to grow this is what it tells you to do well that's what i've done and guess what i got a good garden guess what you know what i come to church i knew where to find my information i knew where to come to get my information from and it was right here and it was studying the bible talking to my brothers and sisters showing experiences having experiences but remember what if that seed is ever going to mature it's got to be put in the right place sure you listen you can put a seed in water and it'll sprout you put just the way we that you can you can accelerate here we go aaron i'm on a rabbit trail if you want you started on one wednesday night you hear what i said i said get back off that trail but if you take your seeds and put them in water and then put paper towels on top of them they will sprout and then you can put them in the ground and they'll grow faster okay well you know what that's a new revelation everybody with me on this i'm not out in the garden anymore same seed same seed different environment produces faster because i put it in a place to where it said moisture moisture i need that i need sunlight but you can't leave it in that paper towel because then it'll go with the carriage of life and and false teaching and and getting away from the word of god i'll just wither and die but put me in some good dirt get me a good row started and and put just a a little bit of a potting soil that's got to live just enough fertilizer to get that thing out of the ground and man i'll have beans we ain't talking about beans because we ain't plant beans this year we got thousands of cans of beans but we're gonna plant some other things but here they come out of the ground well you know what they're doing they're in the right environment and you know what they're gonna do there's no way they can't produce if i put a corn in the ground it's going to produce a stalk if i give it all the nutrition and give it all the water and take it to church every sunday and every wednesday and read the word of god washing of water by the word put it in my furrow guess what i'm gonna get i'm gonna get a cornstalk about this high with two real good ears that from that one kernel of corn there's probably like 2500 seeds on each ear and you got two of them so out of one you get five thousand and if it's an heirloom you can take those two off and you can put them in a in a dry place and they dry up and you can plant that seed for next year spiritual multiplication just like natural multiplication but it takes the right environment and you know what it does it takes knowing what to do knowing where to go to get your information and now we can all plant a good garden this year let's stand our feet we'll get to the new birth wednesday night maybe but that sanctification let me get this before we before we finish this sanctification i mean this justification this sanctification is not exactly the same as this because remember this sanctification is clean and set aside for service but now you've already got once you get the new birth you can't go back and say i'm cleaning the set aside for service like that right right because you're already sealed in devil's sealed out but you are clean and set aside for the next step it's not just you it's not that you're empty and that you need the new birth you've got the new birth at faith but what you need you need to keep putting it in the right environment you keep putting the fertilizer to it you keep feeding it by the way and giving it the washing of the water by the word keep praying keep keep listening to the tapes keep out listen press play when you want to but don't let that be your god because that's not the way the bible says you're going to get perfection it's through a five-fold ministry paul even said by the foolishness of preaching foolishness of preaching sometimes we act to look foolish but this is the way god wants it you know why he knows that's the only way you can get it god didn't write this bible per se to conform to him hold on he wrote this bible seeing what you would conform to what brother brown say he said which age would you rather be in he said i'd rather be in this age around here why he was conformed to this age right here of course he was a church age messenger but you and i were not conformed to being luther's age so god didn't put us in luther's age he put us in this age he bred this one to this one this one to this one oh listen folks how many how many of you people have people that were in the military and some of your family that was in the middle that served in the military okay close like how many some anybody have a father that was in the military hmm what if he got killed in the army hey what if he died what if he got shot you never got here talk about guardian angels let's listen to a story last night man was telling that he met this older gentleman was in world war ii and he was at d-day and he was one of the fortunate ones that didn't get killed he said but as soon as he said as soon as that there was like i think it was 300 or 200 on a boat those those pt boats that comes in and got that big thing it goes down like this well once that thing i mean if it's up like this i mean the bullets ain't going to hit you because it's bulletproof but he said once that thing falls down he said the germans all they had to do it's not moving it's coming straight forward so all you've got to do is go he said they were he said they were men falling around him he said we just push forward he said the sergeant said go go go pushed him forward he said there was people falling right and left he said when i hit the water it was red he said when i got to the beach he said it was red he said and i ran to the nearest he got under some kind of cliff so he made it to that wall but why didn't he die he had somebody sitting in a man's congregation that was a son and daughter of god and it had to come through him i told him that brother ron spencer's when i preached for him several years ago i said there was 600 000 men killed in the civil war and that wasn't foreigners that was your that was here the united states and i said in virginia and north carolina and tennessee was the most death because of the battles were right there you know they have 20 000 people killed on one day i think gettysburg that's 20 000 that's 20 000 generations was cut off in one day yet they were sitting in that congregation and they all had people from the civil war that was there that was their kin folks i said you wouldn't have been here if god hadn't known you needed to be here because you were a son and daughter of god from the foundation of the world but folks that just starts our journey realizing who you are just starts your journey realizing who you are and what you're doing here the prophet of god said you'll be an invincible army let's let's bow our heads lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for letting us share our life we know we all have things that we are ashamed of lord but we also have things that we're proud of we're proud lord that you one day save this wretched center and then about six months later you gave me the baptism of the holy ghost save my soul and put me in a kingdom a kingdom with no end and lord i've been here in this congregation now for 20-something years i've told you many times i'm sorry for wasting the time that i wasted in the world but that had to be part of our journey but lord when we come back you brought us back lord and i've watched the ones in this church that grew up with us and how that they've grown from babies to full adults not only in natural but in spiritual lord i thank you for that for letting me be a part of this and lord all the the desires and and things that that are contrary to you lord i pray that you take them away from us that our desire would be on you lord you said you're an ever-present help in a time of trouble lord we may not be in trouble physically but spiritually lord we all have our battles and i pray lord that you would protect us by the word of god that's being preached and that you'll give us a chance to go up that statue of a perfect man lord to come to maturity lord where you can use even a sister and a brother not just a ministry sometimes we think it's just a ministry in the heads of the church no you want a full body and that's a body of believers lord someone that will come to church every sunday pay their tithe support the ministry and lord live a good christian life that may be their position we all can't be preachers we all can't be deacons we all can't be song leaders but lord we can fill a church up with the holy spirit we can bring our lick of fire let's not smut it over with the world but lord that it's been trimmed our lamps have been trimmed and they're burning bright and lord in this dark hour we need more lights and i thank you for giving us a church of people lord that have those lights and i pray lord the ones that don't i pray lord that you would stir their water lord we want to see everybody in this building filled with the holy ghost that's my desire i know that's been dad's desire for years and years and years but that doesn't do away with all our troubles but it sure does give us a way to handle them and go up that statue of a perfect man lord we're we'll have virtue we'll have the knowledge of god we'll have the temperance of god that one day you stood and platted a rope in a in a house because they were doing something that they weren't supposed to do in your house you said they've made it to den of thieves lord that's where we have to we have to have deacons we have to have elders in the church to keep the church clean that gives temperance and then patience lord that will all make it to the very end in godliness and brotherly kindness how to treat our brother even though the brother hates you or talks despiteful against you lord that's what we're looking at i'm not looking for a church that that shouts the roof off i'm looking for a church that's established settled and grounded in the word of god and then let that anointing strike you promised us that it would lord you said just for a moment i didn't get to read that lord but you said to your prophet just for a moment god will be on full display god will anoint a church then and will do in one year but the theologists have tried to do in 2000 years you said but it's happening right now lord we've seen in part but that which is perfect has come that which is in part to be done away with and that will come to lord to where we will come into speaking condition and speaking terms with you lord thank you for the people that you've given us father i pray now as we go into this solemn time of of communion lord they when you were in the upper room with the 12 you knew one of them was the devil but you still washed his feet you still gave him communion you still loved him you called him friend even judas lord may we be that way may we love each person lord with the love of the lord and may as we take this communion that you'll that you'll strip all the vile things in our body away from us lord all the memory reason conscious effects and imagination this is contrary to you lord i pray that you are just right now lord just create a circumcision in our hearts that you'll take that part out and lord you're a master surgeon you know how to cut where it doesn't where it doesn't do any damage it'll heal right back over and we'll continue on as the body of christ forgive us of our sins lord in our many mistakes lord as we get into the furthermore this service just lord heal the ones that are sick lord if anybody needs healing in the building lord as we take communion lord may you heal their body because it was broken for us and then you gave your life at calvary so that you can come back into us and cover us by your blood just give us this daily bread today lord in jesus name we ask amen let's read in corinthians where paul gives us the commentary of what goes on he loves the lord just spying closer together that's all i ask us to do buying closer together doesn't matter what goes on what comes what comes what goes that we bind together first corinthians 11 verse 23 says for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had give thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this dew in remembrance of me after the same manner he also took the cup and he sucked when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood he's getting ready to institute a new testament in my blood not goat's blood or not the blood of of animals it'll be human blood the blood of god new testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the blood body and blood of the lord see we can stop right there and we'll say well we're all unworthy brother we just can't do this you got to get through that you got to get through that just what i've been talking about you got to get through that if you're born again in your soul you're good and you may be walking in god getting ready to receive the new birth that's okay but not with unconfessed sins and like i said you know forgive me of my sins lord truly forgive me of and clean me out and keep me clean not just not just so i can not just two days well it's communion day so i gotta i gotta pray a little harder no that's probably not going to do you a lot of good okay as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death until he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and that's what we did today i hope you were examining yourself examine yourself i i can't examine you you have to examine yourself right the lord can examine you through me but i can't you know we're just we're just we're judges we we judge everything cut you know cut the head off you know get rid of them that's what i was thinking a couple weeks ago thank goodness y'all didn't come around me i'm just and i'm not joking i'm just i got something on me and and i believe it's gone now but but you know what it didn't come from stay away from church it came from staying right here pressing the battle we're gonna win we're gonna lose some battles we're gonna fail but we're not gonna fall the war is already won you know he looked at gideon and gideon was so scared he was hiding he was hiding behind a well god didn't say now get in you got some work to do man he said no gideon you mighty man of valor come right here you got something you need right here in your hand i said he said let's go i haven't you had enough of them philistines getting that stuff off remember what was they were stealing stuff or taking stuff or something like that you know going on and he said aren't you he said i'm sick and tired god said you got what you need go do it and he and you know what he did wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord and worldly shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that blood and bread and drink of that cup that's what we've done we've examined ourselves today for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy he doesn't drink contamination to himself not discerning the lord's body that's the bride for this cause many are weak and sickly among you many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat terry one for another and if any man hunger lady meet at home that you come out together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come when paul went back to the corinthians he said the rest will i set an order he was bringing everything the spiritual gifts and all the different things to the to the corinthians so let's bow our heads just for a moment have a silent prayer brother brown said pray for your pastor and he'll be praying for you lord thank you for what you give us now pray that you give us more lord then as our cup is filled up that are run over and we be so full of you lord that we'll get out of this place or just be with us in the furtherment of this institution that you give us call communion and foot washing lord and just be with us and may your may your holy spirit just bathe us all lord and give us lord a renewing of our spirit father the renewing of our mind lord that we keep our mind more on you lord than we have before forgive us of our sins lord and our faults bless our pastor lord and keep him strong jesus name we pray amen the bible said he took the bread and then he blessed it lord thank you for this bread it's been made by holy hands lord the world sometimes they they try to do things right but lord they buy the bread and don't know where it's made from but lord we know where this came from it was made just exactly the way you said lord now i pray that you sanctify it lord the nourishment of our body and lord to the nourishment of our spiritual life and that this communion lord will be a representation that we are your children and we are in the family of god and we're doing the things that we're supposed to do lord that you'll give us blessings in jesus name we pray amen you know god don't have to bless you if you're not in his word but you know what he does have to bless you if you're in his word because he's obligated brother brown said he's not obligated anything but his word that's what he's obligated to he's obligated to his word and nothing else so everybody getting the word of god we'll get some blessings many times we think that uh i think i'll just do this you know and god's gonna bless it be careful i'm gonna do this and god's gonna bless it no you ask god to bless it and please don't uh i had a brother one time that another church not from here he uh he said the lord wanted him to go to work on sunday so that he could send all that money for that day to the mission field yes what i thought god didn't tell you to work on sunday and it was a disaster by the time he got finished and realized it was a disaster he was a spiritually broke man but see remember he thought he was doing right to begin with he had a desire well listen we all have a desire to do more from mission work and do more for the people of god but you got to do it the right way you can't do it any way you want to do it if i decide i want to work on sunday it's cause i don't want to go to church hello and that's not what did god tell us that was the right way to go nope he didn't tell us that's the right way to go and i love him you know what i love i love when this thing comes back empty i love when that comes back empty i love when they have to go back there and fill up some more of these because that means people are taking communion to heavenly father thank you for this wine lord it's been prepared with holy hands lord and it's went through the process of fermentation and now it's lord it's it's it's come to a place that it can't get old lord it just keeps getting stronger and stronger and father may you become stronger and stronger to each one of us lord as we partake of this communion let it not be just a ritual but let it be something lord that you maybe many times we we think about what really is going on in that upper room lord so we kind of try to time travel back into the into that upper room and and be sitting there and watch you wash the disciples feed and watch you take this cup and watch you take the bread lord and just pass it around and said take this and eat it lord it's a symbol and lord we appreciate that symbol that you give us father we honor and praise your name for this that we can do lord we've seen people heal by just taking communion so i pray today if anybody has anything in there in their body i pray that you'd heal it today lord as we take this communion let the healing power of jehovah rapha take over today and heal his father give us faith lord to make it through lord just as we have faith that this wine will be real good when we take it lord because it represents the holy ghost which is real good all the time thank you lord in jesus name we ask amen come morning i walk by the river i'll rest near the ever green tree i'll carry my cross through the midnight that's our trials and tribulations we'll carry our cross for me sometimes i'm despised world hates us reject him and i question oh father how long then i take one more look at mount calvary and it gives me the strength to go on morning i'll walk by the river i'll rest near the ever green tree i'll carry my cross to the darkest hour but come morning come morning there's glory for me to me that's one of the most calming songs come morning i'll walk by the river it'll all be over we won't have to run we'll have to worry about going to work bills to pay we'll have to worry about trials and troubles you can really hear the water run then i mean you know you or me and brother danny in different ones who go fishing it's a calming effect when you get into that river and you know what it may be a rapids that's just roaring like you wouldn't believe but you know what it just calms you down because you know that water's doing its job and there's some fish in that water and there's some life in that water and that's a calming effect that's why you know brother branham said he said you find me he said you find a river you should you find the river of life down there and he said you'll find a cabin down there real close to it he said you'll be hearing me sing amazing grace what about a prophet of god that's going to be given more accola accolades than any prophet that's ever been on the face of the earth prophet church age messenger brings millions of people into into the into the kingdom of god brings a group of people his message will bring a group of people to a body change that no one has ever come to amen and he said lord give me a cabinet give me a cabin uh the lord's gonna say no i think i'll give you this mansion but if you want a cabin you have one but he just says lord just give me a cabin one time he said like david he said lord just let me be a doormat in the house of god just let me be something at the door that people wipe their feet on but they're going into the house of god it's something that i do a doormat's really important when it's muddy right doormat's real important when it's muddy or rainy you can wipe your feet off and go in the house so that's what brother brown was saying he said lord i don't care let them wipe their feet on me he said just let me be a part of it that same way with me and you listen everybody's not going to be preachers and deacons and elders and no ever seal that ever opened and you understand what i'm saying but you can still be a child a son and daughter of god did y'all make exactly enough oh bob must have done that my brother that's great though that's good that used every one of them didn't it that's what i want to do i want to see it fill that thing up about three times be all right with me let's take communion i'm like sister gayle that's pretty good wine just think about it though that's not gonna be nothing what we're gonna get to drink over there sit down to marriage supper have wine and bread what a day that'll be with my jesus i shall see when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace let's go to saint john 13 as they as we get ready for the foot washing the sisters will go downstairs as soon as we get finished the supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of judas this carrot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper supper and laid aside his garment and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel with he was girded i don't believe he washed judas's feet no different see if that's the same characteristic they never brother brown they said you never knew who he was in who his enemies were or who his friends were he treated them all the same and when i think of that i think of that man in that upper room called jesus christ knowing by discernment that that was the devil you read it right here devil now put in the heart of jesus cat yet he washed his feet just the same treats the sinner just as much the same as he does a child of god that's brotherly kindness he rises from supper and laid inside his garment took a towel and girded himself and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and the wipe them with the towel her with he was girded then cometh he to simon peter here's peter again and peter said unto him lord do you wash my feet jesus said hmm what i do though i know it's not now but you're going to be the spokesman on the day of pentecost and you're going to understand what's going on but thou shalt know hereafter peter said unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus said uh if i wash thee not thou has no part with me wow that's true he didn't he didn't
