========================================

exceeded god bless you saints it's good to be in the house of the lord you ready for church this morning all right let's see if we can that's not it there we go all right so let's let's just uh just do a little background on hebrews uh where we come from this morning um we're almost to chapter seven and uh you remember paul was talking about in hebrews about how he's trying to lay the foundation that uh of of who christ is and and kind of walked walked the believer through as as uh the people that he was preaching to or wrote that letter to about how you begin to believe on christ and he walked them through the journey through the wilderness that how the the failures of the israelites they they uh failed to to to take god at his word and accept that he was taking them to the promise of of rest and then what rest is and um and then you know the whole book of hebrews is just an encouraging so encouraging about how you need to keep pressing on and and believing and endure to the end because we've got a promise that god gave us through not not just just just a a just a flippant saying but he actually made an oath on top of the word that he gave us so that we would have two immutable things to know that the god is gonna he's gonna see us through to the end so as we read through the uh where we are in verse nine let's just go to the author in prayer lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather together again and we just ask lord as we study these things out and unpack the scripture lord that you'll open these things to us lord and give us understanding we pray lord that you'll just bless brother wade as he's preparing lord jesus and get our hearts in mind for the services today lord that will be ready to receive what you have in store for us amen so in verse 9 it says but beloved we are convinced of better things regarding you and things that accompany salvation even though we are speaking in this way and i'm reading from nasb just to kind of change things up a little bit so sometimes this little bit can can help to your understanding to read from a different translation and then we're going to switch back to the king james version for god is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward his name by having served and by still serving the saints and we desire that each one of you demonstrate the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope unto the end so that you will not be sluggish but imitators of those who through faith and endurance inherit the promises so let's just kind of key in on those two words you inherit the promises to faith and enduring just keep at it the tortoise is the one that wins the race slow and steady faith and endurance inherit the promises for when god made the promise to abraham since he would could swear an oath by no one greater he swore by himself saying indeed i will greatly bless you and i will greatly multiply you and so having patiently waited he obtained the promise for people swear an oath by one greater than themselves and with them an oath serving as confirmation as an end of every dispute so god swore an oath that he was going to keep his promise and you think about promise in verse 17 it says in the king james version god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise that promise that he gave to abraham that he was going to that his seed would be blessed and the gates of the enemies would not uh prevail against this against this promise of the seed which is christ the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us now let's just meditate just briefly on all these promises that that that the promise that was spoken throughout throughout all the scripture in luke chapter 24 behold i send the promise the promise is that seed the seed which is christ the promise of the holy ghost in acts chapter 2 for the promises unto you and to your children in acts chapter 13 when paul was speaking he just said we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise was which was made unto the fathers god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children and that he hath raised up jesus again as it is also written in the same in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begotten thee now now just keep keep in mind as we as we make our way through the scripture that as we're getting we're getting close to chapter seven where paul's trying to make a case of who uh that christ is that melchizedek and that he came in the order of melchizedek to fulfill the promise of eternal life in us so in verse 19 he says which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made in high priest forever after the order of melchizedek which hope we have as an anchor of the soul we've got an anchor this hope that we have is is something that will carry our whole life well you've got a promise of god you can look and read in in the scripture it it's something that will you can just hang everything on and what what what are we what are we hanging all of our hopes on that he entered it he was the one that entered into that that which entereth into that within the veil so what what's that veil that he's talking about brother braham said in hebrews chapter six he said in the veil the veil is the flesh the veil is what keeps us from seeing god face to face in this church the veil is what keeps us from seeing the angels there at their positions this morning so when christ as our forerunner entered into the veil he he came down and entered he he he came down to dwell in flesh the veil is what keeps us from seeing the angels at their positions this morning standing by the seats the veil is what keeps us from seeing him we are hid behind the veil and that veil is the flesh we are sons and daughters of god we're in the presence of god the angels of god are encamped about those who fear him but the veil is the flesh that's what keeps us out of his presence but through the soul the spirit by our faith we know that he's watching us he's standing by us he's here now so that veil that he entered he he came down to dwell in the flesh of christ to manifest himself in flesh the first one is the forerunner so that we would be able he would be able to dwell in our flesh after he died on the cross and went through all the process look at all the things that that is speaking of here that paul is talking about he said here it is hold it tight the veil is what keeps us from living the way we should veil is what keeps us from doing the things that we really want to do and god became veiled in flesh and the veil was tore into and god became god again and he raised up the veil that he hid himself in that's the resurrection of the lord jesus proving to us that in this veil that we're now hidden by faith we believe it and accept it and when this veil is tore into i'll go in his presence with this assurance knowing that i know him in the power of his resurrection at the coming of the lord jesus this veil will be raised up again in a perfected way till i walk and talk with him as my savior and my god when he takes the throne of david and will live forever in this veil after it's been perfected but this veil has sin in it it don't matter how don't ever think of that glorified body in this earth it's got to die same as your soul has to die to be born again now now see what's he said in the stage for he said the state before why did when in hebrews chapter seven we're going to get to the question why did abraham pay tithes to melchizedek he's looking he he's looking at this man why did so many not recognize jesus but behind that veil if you can recognize that behind that veil of the flesh there's a there's god actually manifested god came down to dwell within behind that veil both sure and steadfast and which enters into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made in high priest forever after the order of of melchizedek the forewater to come down and dwell in that veil dwell behind the veil to go through all the things that that you're going to go through as a christian let's examine that again we looked at that last time that everything that you go through as a christian christ has already done it because he's our forerunner he he was born in a little manger he he went down the river to be baptized with john he went on up to the mount transfiguration for where a voice said hear ye him he he he died to himself in the garden of gethsemane he rose from the dead as many of the saints were going to rise by that same power that caused him to rise and and he ascended up to go return back to the father just as we'll do when our bodies change then we go back you see what that whether the forerunner is for us entered has a lot of meaning because it means that everything that we go through as a christian christ already did it because he's veiled he he came down to be veiled behind that flesh to forerun everything that you'll go through as a christian brother iran said the forerunner the man that went before us as one come and took our place none other but god himself he come down and made himself a man for a forerunner to prove to the people why he swore an oath he was going to do it he swore he was going to save us he swore that we could do it he swore these things to him by himself to us by himself you see what a what a positive gospel we've got amen the greater is he that is in us and he is into the world then he come down and was made a forerunner he made himself a forerunner he entered here on the world and lived in the world sin all around him and above sin because he trusted god that's that should give us confidence to know that this that he's already done it he's already lived to prove that that that god veiled in flesh is able to overcome everything that the devil can throw at him so you've got that same life dwelling in you whatever the devil throws at you you're you've got that same that that's what that scripture means greater is he that is in us than he is in the world you've got that same overcoming power that's living in you now the same overcoat i got that picture of of of of jesus being accused by pilate you know apollo's asking what is truth and and and that that was god veiled in flesh that was not recognized by pilate and all the jews standing there that's that's what that's what paul is going to get to in hebrews chapter 7 why did they not recognize that that was melchizedek veiled in flesh there brother brown said in hebrews chapter 60 and he said the forerunner he tells us there's a place just beyond yonder where you're never and you'll never get old because he's a forerunner he he's he's come come back he he sent his word back to tell us all of these things there'll never be no wrinkles you won't have to use max factors to make you look nice to your husband the forerunner has went on there's never a place where you get old weary and shaky he entered in and immortal will stand in his likeness some day yonder the stars and the sun they'll out shine certainly the forerunner has gone before us now it says paul's saying whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made in high priest forever after the order of melchizedek so now paul's trying to lay a foundation that the order changed in the old testament they were the high priest was after the order of of aaron but in the new testament after the order of melchizedek so the order changed the structure of things changed the way things work changed and the way that it works in the old testament the order of aaron was a mortal you've got a mortal man that's going to die he's going to get to the end of his days he's going to grow a gray beard and you're going to have to get another one but the order of melchizedek is an unchanging priesthood in the old testament you have a priest that would go in and he'd have to go and repeat it every year and offer sacrifices over and over but the order of melchizedek is one sacrifice made that was sufficient for everything sufficient for you to be redeemed sufficient to pay the price this is the send it sufficient to make you perfect which in the old the old testament the order of error and it was not sufficient to make the believer perfect but in the order of melchizedek it was sufficient because it's an immortal eternal order an order that was an order that's set up based on the eternal life of god so that's the that's the the point that paul's trying to make is we're we're not believing something that's just based on man's ideas or legal ideas or or or or uh carnal succession of a man but we're believing something that's eternal it based upon the eternal life of god now so what is a high priest in the old testament the high priest was a the high priest was a mediator the priest played a role in preparing the relationship between god and man in hebrews chapter 5 it says paul remember if you remember what paul said he said every high priest taken from among men is ordained for me and then things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity so the high priestess is trying to restore a relationship between god and man and you know although all the the things that would be done on the day of atonement the scapegoat going into the wilderness and the other the other girl being sacrificed and uh the the blood being sprinkled on the on the on the altar and all of those things were acts that were typing out what christ would do on the cross when he restored relationship with heaven and earth kissed and he restored a relationship between god and man through what he did on the cross now you think who wha if if that was what the old testament high priest would do what would this new testament high priest do what would that look like what would this high priest do and you've got all these examples of christ now he's veiled in flesh walking on the shores of galilee and what's he doing he's he's fulfilling that role of a high priest forgiving sins they're in in luke chapter five when they could not find by what way that they would bring him in because of the multitude they went upon the housetop and he they lowered this man down that was that was all he had all these infirmities and when he saw their faith jesus said man thy sins are forgiven thee now what kind of a man would this be to forgive to forgive sin does it have to be god in flesh so you now now we're getting into a different order that god has actually come down and veiled in flesh somebody that can forgive you of your sins and brother brown said in living dying buried rising coming he said i'm not justified by anything i could do see now the order is being changed not from from works that you do where you gotta do do all these things under the old testament law i'm not justified by anything i could do none of my goodness i have none and neither do you but it's through his sacrifices through his death we are justified by believing on him there is where our justice stands not what i do or what you do but what he did for us that ain't the gospel story i don't know it oh give me that and take all the rest of it away see that one who died for me i see you've got this man that's god veiled in flesh and this this y'all got this little picture of this the little woman that came up and washed his feet and he said i forgive you of your sins the the little woman that they came to uh that they uh they dragged before him because she had been called in adultery and and he uh talked or wrote in the sand until all of her all of her accusers went away and he said i don't i don't i don't accuse you i don't i'm i'm not going to judge you i forgive you that that's god veil in flesh forgiving forgiving sin that's that's what this melchizedek came to do was to make things right so in hebrews chapter 7 and 6 if we read this again whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made an high priest forever after the order of melchizedek and if we go back to hebrews chapter 7 he says it is far yet far more evident for that after the similitude of melchizedek there ariseth another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life yes you see there's there's the there's the biggest example of that order being changed not after the law of a carnal commandment not after just uh trying to trying to find in your natural genealogy trying to search it back to see so many people in the message today it seems like they're putting more emphasis on their the way that you came naturally than the the new births you see that after the order of melchizedek is putting putting emphasis on that new birth eternal life not on the the way that you or what parents you came from or trying to search your genealogy all the way back to see if you maybe you came from adam or where you came from not after the law of a carnal commandment where where the succession of a high peaceful priest was passed down from one to another by natural genealogy but the power of an endless life eternal life is what we're talking about with melchizedek so in hebrews chapter seven we finally made it he says for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of man abideth a priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils i consider he's he's asking that question let's consider how great this man was that somebody like abraham would pay ties to him why would abraham pay ties to this man why why do we pay tithes in church and who is this melchizedek he said notice now his attribute so we got to answer the question who is this melchizedek and we're really answering the question why did abraham pay ties to this man why did this this man came walking up veiled in flesh uh god veiled in flesh why did abraham pay ties to it so we got to go back now brother brown was he begins to talk about how this man was god veiled in flesh he said now his attribute then the attribute was first god the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us in saint john the first chapter in the first verse noticed this in the beginning but before the eternal in the beginning was the word when the time began it was word but before it was word it was attribute a thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word now we're getting where melchizedek is that's this mysterious person in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and then the word became flesh and dwelt among us his first being was spirit god supernatural all right the great eternal second he began to form himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body this then is the state he was in when he first when he met abraham was called melchizedek he was in the form of theophany now we'll get to that and prove in a few minutes the lord willing he was the word now see there's the answer in the question why did abraham pay ties to him because he knew that was the word now now let's uh let's get ready for a deep dive now brother brown when he would when he would go back and talk about the the logos being expressed from the father uh a lot of times he would describe he would say in one place no you you're never gonna see the father and and there's no way for you to see the father the only way you can see the father is to see the expression of the father which is the logo the word being expressed if you want to see the father today the expression of the father is might be sitting in the chair next to you so you you've got to see the word express the word expressed shows the father that's why jesus said if no man can see the father except by me uh he said if you've seen me you've seen the father and and so when jesus will describe the father it's it's kind of there's no way for you to put a picture i've got i got pictures on the next few slides and i've only got five minutes but so we'll continue this next time but brother i'm going to describe the father in in in like a diamond or a fountain or a rainbow now you think of those all those attributes that be being expressed and now from that thing that uh that that form that you can't quite you you can't quite quite understand came the logos so out from that thought or the attribute i've got a picture of the of a diamond with all these different facets and brother and would explain it out from all those different the the facets you like you'd say you take a three a diamond with three points on it and you turn it different ways and you'd see a rainbow coming out of it and so out from that came that theophany body the logos body that that then was put in in a natural body or you put take a little fountain and brother around would say a fountain with streams coming out each stream would be a stream of love a stream of righteousness a stream of all the streams of the attributes of god and out from that the out from that attribute it was expressed the word so brother ram would say you say could you imagine before there even was an earth before there was a light before there was a star before there was anything there's a great fountain going forth of spirit and out of this fountain came the most pure of love because there was nothing for it to come from that but love now we what we call love today is a perverted love but just as we get an essence or a little bit of that love in us it changes our whole opinion but then out of there come another stream off this main fountain the diamond and it was called righteousness absolutely righteousness and he said now when these great lights went out a great rays of spirit love peace now don't forget though we're trying to answer the question why did abraham pay ties to this man when these great lights went out a great raise of spirit love peace that's all there was there wasn't no suffering there wasn't no hate nor no malice it couldn't come from this fountain that was jehovah that was jehovah god and now as the theologians call it a theophany went from that which was called in the scripture of the logos the logos that went out of god it's hard to explain but it was a part of god the logos and this grave found this great fountain of spirit which had no beginning or no end this great spirit began to form in the creation and the logos that went out from it was the son of god it was the only visible form that the spirit had and it was a theophany which means a body and the body was like a man and in the pillar of fire he said the bible teaches us that the logos went out of god or i may say all of the god becoming his first body form when the logos went out of god let's look what it looked like no one has seen the father at any time nowhere never did and never will but then the logos that went out of him became like a little become like a little halo of light let's see and play it let's see it playing under like a child before the doorstep of the father and now i can see him as he moves over here and he draws into his memory or his mind a picture of what the world should be now there's not a star or nothing and that interesting quote he draws into his memory or his mind what should i create and he knows he knows how to make it i hear him say let there be and an atom broke yonder and when it did the sun came into existence and began to whirl she burned for millions of years and millions and millions of years after a while i see a clinker fly off it what is it the first star that flew from the sun the musician can go ahead and come forward he watches it fall for a few million years and he stops it then another one flies off and he lets it fall a few million years and stops it what's he doing writing his first bible the zodiac in the beginning god was a spirit and all the fountain of goodness and mercy and power and all the good things of love god was the center of that fountain and then the logos that went out of god in the beginning become what we would call a theophany or a supernatural body god is just not like the heir but he's in a body in hebrews chapter four he said in the beginning was the same he was that great spirit fountain everything that was pure was in this fountain it began to form a body a theophany the kind of body that we go to and we'll stop there why did moses and why did abraham pay ties to that man because that was god building flesh mm-hmm you
