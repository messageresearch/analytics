blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it defile not the land shall init children amen Webster said Refuge is uh shelter or protection from danger or distress and means a resort for help and difficulty then skolfield say the City of Refuge are types of Christ Sheltering The Sinner from judgment but for us at any City in city right right yes so the Lord spake unto Moses saying Comm the children of Israel that they give to the Levites 48 cities to dwell in and out of the Cities you shall make six cities a refuge right in the Old Testament it was a nine for n and a Toth for the Toth I don't want to get up the subject but I wish it was today I mean almost some countries they uh if you steal something they cut your hand you steal again they cut your other hand so maybe they won't be so many innocent people get killed sorry throw that in that's okay in the message uh ler out the pressure brother says that now in the Old Testament God seen in some of this trouble actually accidentally done so if you're innocent and not guilty God makes a way for you now if a man kill a man just that liberally pred premeditated he was lost he could not come to this place but if he did it accidentally he didn't mean to do it then there was a City of Refuge one was at Raman Gilead and four places I think Joshua placed the cities a refuge now that people not could not come to the City of Refuge if accidentally he done some something wrong he didn't mean to he would come to the City of Refuge and go to the gate the gatekeeper would ask him why he can't he was coming what was his idea of coming then his case was pleed and when his case was pleed at the gate and a man be found innocent he did it not willfully then the man was taken into the city as a place of Refuge then the enemy could not get him and if he lied and done wrong and come into the City of Refuge though he was holding to the altar of horns his enemy had a the privilege and right to drag him from the Altar and kill him yes sir because he was guilty pre premeditated and he had to be [Music] punished I was asking brother waade about Cain uh Cain could not come to the City of Refuge because he refused the sacrifice I think brother BR said uh that Kane said that's all I got take it believe right but uh what about David and uh 2 Samuel chapter 1213 and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also had put away your thy sin Thou shalt not die because David was the apple of God's eyes so he could not so he could come to the City of Refuge I still couldn't get him David all that he did and that God loved him yeah and uh Isaiah 322 and a man shall be as a hidden place from the wind and covered from The Tempest a rivers of water in a dry place at the shadow of a great rock in a weary land Psalms 18:10 the name of the Lord is a strong tower righteousness run into it and his sa that's Psalms 9:9 the Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble Psalms 461 to the chief musician for the sons of cor a song upon Oman God is a refuge and a strength a very present help and trouble Psalms 561 to the chief M upon what do you use all them names David when the Philistines took him men that be merciful unto me oh God for man would be would swallow me up he fighted daily oppress me yeah son 571 to Chief musician I know they got all them name when David when he plead from Saul in the cave be merciful unto me oh God be merciful unto me for my soul trusted in thee ye in the shadow of thy Wings will I make my refuge until these calamities be overpassed Psalm 62:7 and God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God PSAL 628 trust in him at all time ye people pour out your heart before him and God is a refuge for us Sheila yes Psalm 717 I'm as a Wonder unto many but thou are my strong Refuge amen Psalms 1036 the Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that oppressed Psalms 1467 which executed judgment from the oppressed which give it food to the hungry the Lord loosen the prisoners [Music] mhm in the message uh L off the pressure brother said uh he said there's a pressure on the people today and that pressure has no limitations or any domination line it has no AE line it has no respect the person it's on young old good and bad it's on everybody we're living in an artic age nervous tension everybody's racing here and going there and going nowhere it's just to that kind of an age I know this church would be plagued with it it's everywhere is played with it Tabernacle played with it everywhere the whole world it's today of pressure hurry hurry hurry up and wait Drive 90 M hour mm what is it today yeah tce that cutting people off and yes he said uh to get home for supper and wait 2 hours till it gets ready that's right right he he gets you to a nervous t and the wife says something a little contrary you want to fly off temper husband says something you pat your food and tell him to get in the room see well I'm my husband I don't want to words with you go in there prob get in that dog house yeah why oh I'm so nervous why what's the matter see all this together this tension building up and the result of it is doing something wrong and acting out of place that's right now make the poor act that way it'll make the middle class act that way it'll make the rich act that way it'll make the wrong act that way it'll make the pretty good act that way it'll make the good act that way because extension steam build up got to blow it out somewhere see if you don't you blow up the boiler mhm he talks about when he goes to make the calls for R Apple at the hospital he goes to the hospital and he's uh ask his lady came to see this certain lady she's in room room 221 and they gave me this two number they says at 221 at 3:21 and uh she goes one L I don't know one L right the corner you know so what would you say your name was he tell I think she said go upstairs go upstairs downstairs get going up downstairs he says uh I like this little part say he says that he said they got little wings and things cut up in the hospital so here com this doctor walking down with his stereoscope on his hand and said I never did see a man was 4 feet tall and 4T wide but he just about matched the that he was walking along there I said good

a lady here somewhere that's going to have surgery in the morning and she's near dead said I'm a minister a pastor up there could make his call and they gave me this number he said just a moment brother brother BR I'll find out well thank you Lord she laid down everything W over there and got oh she said yes brother she's in room so and so to your left right there I said thank you very much I turned around and look and go that's it l off the steam everybody just becoming Arctic everybody's all built up hav't haven't got no time that builds up to a place that it breaks up things it causes people to have hard feelings when they snap them out and say things you don't mean to say now everybody's guilty of it I'm guilty you're guilty we do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise so there's and excess pressure building up today I believe before I go on further I may say this I believe it's the enemy coming down and pressuring I believe is the devil right he talks about uh he said about 3 years ago he said he went on a hunting trip with his uh Indian chief so he go uh they start going up the mountain and brother said uh hurry up hurry up they looks up in the m and says uh he said uh too fast slow down so he puts in second gear too fast slow down he puts it in first gear he said oh my I said Chief El is up there and the chief said he said him stay up there he was BN there he won't leave I said I guess that's right yeah he letting off the pressure brother said the man must want to stay in this Refuge it cannot go in there complaining he must want to stay no complaining about it outside he dies inside he safe right he said well I want to say something to the people here if you're not a Christian I come to the City of Refuge about 30 one years ago and brother I never want to go out oh I come into Christ everything that I long for wasn't here I don't want to go out I pray daily oh God I'm so happy here just let me stay I never want to leave I know he he'll never leave me I know he'll never leave me leave you and the pressure gets greater if it does then he is our Outlet so we don't have to worry about it amen he said uh when you go to a City of Refuge you have to come on your own free will and like you said don't be complain that you want to get out once you're in there you got to stay in y yes that's all sorry that's okay well praise the Lord that's good we started too early yeah you didn't start too early you started fine the reason that no sh down we're not finished yet finished yet good job buddy thank you job good job good job it kind of evolved into this but um because of the bad weather yesterday they called me to post office and told me to be on alert for today that I may have to work so that was early in the morning so I called brother Joe to see if he would take over Sunday school class and then I got to thinking they called me at 12:00 and said well you don't have to work today we'll do it all Monday so we're going to do it on Monday but it kind of got me thinking a little bit that it's been a long time since y'all any of the four guys that I got down here has been teaching Sunday school so what I'm going to start doing is is it's quite all right y'all don't have to listen to me the whole quite all right y'all don't have well listen but what we're going to do what we're going to do is is we're going to start once a month one of you four is going to do it in rotation we stared with him so we'll go with Bob and then you and then you but I'm not going to tell you what Sunday until Saturday and then that'll make sure that these people come and they won't know who they're going to hear but once a month you ought to listen to somebody else once a month you you really ought that's right so I'll call you Sunday morning and tell you it's your time how about that even if I have no friendly no understand song Lead won't Che yeah no okay no all you're not leading singing in the morning you a singing in the afternoon I'm thinking about it though that's okay you can come down here and sing a song If you want to that's whatever you want to do but uh but yeah I think we'll we'll start doing that once a month because you know it gets it shouldn't get boring but listen you need different angles we need a fivefold Ministry so we need five you know we need different angles of different things and and we know you know we're on the seals and and uh but maybe bringing something fresh in kind of joging our memory a little bit about certain things you know um and honestly I was thinking a few weeks ago not about City of Refuge but how that we're that we are protected by God in this age we are protected more in this age now this is the most pressure age MH but we're protected by God cuz he give us all the defenses for this age so we don't literally have to run into a defense City but we if we run into the word God's God's going to have to he's going to have to see us St when we get out remember what brother Bown said you if the devil's on you you went out to meet him he didn't come in to get you so what' you do you left that Refuge City that's right you went outside for something that looked tantalizing amen and you didn't get back in the city fast enough or you or he caught you on the way back in but if you'll stay in that defense city which now is the word of God it was literal cities back then I mean like the B if you killed somebody maliciously they dealt with you but if you killed somebody without malice or just happened to be an accident well the Bible says you the brothers have to go kill that you know the family members have to go kill that person without any judgment but but God put up cities there where you can run into that City and they'd keep you there until judgment was passed they couldn't come in and kill you there had to be a judge same thing with God the mercy of God is it's like brother Dale was saying the other night without the shed blood of Jesus Christ this whole world will be annihilated including Christians the Flesh of us would be annihilated right brother R said that red blood he can only hear your voice he can't see you amen so he hears your voice through that blood and but when but remember what is the blood the blood is the bleeding word and now when we lift off the earth and the word the word made flesh goes home there's no more blood amen only for the 144,000 there's there's blood for them but there's no blood atonement for anybody else after we're gone so there is no refuge City then Refuge cities are gone just like the literal Refuge cities are gone there are no refuge cities over there now that people can go to it's all law it's all the the man-written laws right and we see that the manw written laws are written basically from the Bible right somebody said that to brother randam or some some preacher said well we got laws he said your laws come out of the Bible your laws come out of the word of God Refuge City what's a refuge City when a lawyer comes in and your bails paid you're free to go nobody can touch you until they come back in and sit down and have a what a trial so there's a refuge in the law that says nobody can bother you even the state or the federal government can't bother you until you're brought in and you're judged by jury of of your peers and it comes right straight from the Bible I mean why why is it 12 jurors 12 tribes of Israel okay the 12 I believe that the 12 tribes of Israel would send a representative and they would judge cuz the tribes of Israel were all over and they would judge those 12 tribes that's why there's 12 people in in a jury they just some some people probably don't know that but right but that's the way it is so but yeah go ahead in Joshua when Joshua talks about it in the Book of Joshua it said the Elders of the city so the people that were the Elders of the Cities of Refuge correct were were appointed to do do that correct and I would say they were appointed one from each tribe because you had 12 it was just strange that it's was 12 and it's 12 tribes of Israel One Elder from each tribe would come and sit at counsel they would present the case if he said death they sent him out if he said hey you did it you know if you did it not maliciously and that's what we consider see we have manslaughter manslaughter is not considered murder as far as premeditated murder but it's that you killed somebody out of a situation in defense or whatever and sometimes you can get convicted of manslaughter and you don't have to go to jail that's right cuz if you kill in self-defense you don't have to go to jail right that's that's the same see where the laws came from then but but now according to the law you kill him we kill you right you know so what was it where it said they got to stay there until the priest died I don't really understand that right quick Aaron does A's got his hand up the Lord showed me that a long time ago and it's one of the most amazing things because when brother I'm talking about a Christian you know you come into Christ which is that City of Refuge but you're here on Earthly Journey but at the death of the high priest which is the ending of Jesus Christ's intercession then we rapture so that's what it said because he had to stay in that City of Refuge until that death of the high priest and then he could be restored he could go back to his City and they couldn't touch him he was free right which is the same thing as us we are under the shed blood of Jesus Christ here until we Rapture and then we're free everything goes back to way it was in God's mind right so that's why was the death of the high priest because it's the end of them cuz you got to remember too in the Bible even when Jesus had to leave and went to Egypt they waited you know the angel come back and told Joseph said that Herod is dead so in other words the law of Herod and it's just like us coming up to a new election of a president you know Trump's going to veto everything that that Obama did so you know you're going to you just you and it's a different thought process it's still all rotten and junk but it is when you bring another Administration in there are things that you disallow or say well that's done well see when Herod died what was it if you were a baby 2 years old and younger you were killed well the Jesus went to Egypt with Mary and Joseph and then the Lord told the angel told him said okay you can come back now why that law was gone it died with Herod mhm and then they could come back so that was good with the high priest which I knew that had to be some kind of example with Jesus Christ cuz he is the high priest of our confession you know so but thank God for that but U anything else but that's what we're going to do the next the next 12 months if we're not here 12 months sorry don't be sorry you want me to take next H so next Sunday you want no a I want you to sing every Sunday once a month I know that no it's once a month the month he's done he's already done yeah once a month he's already done help me out he's done so I appreciate all these guys you know I do and they're good support but you need to hear them you need to hear some if you know even the same one um even if everything is good um you like to hear somebody else something different you do yeah you do get into a cog and I see some of you sit there and you fall asleep so I don't do a whole lot of good to a lot of you so but um maybe somebody like brother Joe or somebody will jog your memory and you'll stay awake for a little while so Lord bless you get out of here
