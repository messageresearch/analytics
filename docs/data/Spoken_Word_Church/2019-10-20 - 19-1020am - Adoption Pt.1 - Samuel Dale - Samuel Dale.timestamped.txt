[18:37] write them down and a lot of times I

[19:17] just set down for a little while and
[19:18] fellowship together around your word and
[19:21] be able to feast upon you and that
[19:24] you're a light shine in our hearts
[19:25] enough we pray that you would just got
[19:28] each and every one of us keep us in your
[19:30] love
[19:31] remember those that are not with us
[19:32] today for the different reasons and
[19:34] things we will brother Richard or when
[19:36] traveling back home today and thank you
[19:38] Father for the opportunity to be able to
[19:42] live in a day that we could see a
[19:43] miracle taking place right among us and
[19:45] just see you manifesting yourself in
[19:48] Dale's life we ask you to just continue
[19:50] it on Lord have your way to remember all
[19:52] the others that are sick among us and
[19:54] guide us
[19:55] you said you sent your word and healed
[19:57] us and we believe you forgive our sins
[19:59] will cleanse us and keep us in Jesus
[20:02] name Amen you know brother Branham said
[20:05] one day said you talk about a miracle
[20:08] you know we all want miracles we want
[20:11] something happen instantly miracles but
[20:13] he said when you've got to stay there
[20:15] and hold on and it takes time there to
[20:19] do and the things that could be
[20:21] testified today of what Dale Roberts has
[20:24] went through the word that he knows
[20:26] people's names he knows all kind of
[20:29] things voices he knows all of it he can
[20:32] in do things and talk to him through the
[20:35] little thing they got in this tube guy
[20:36] and it's it's an amazing thing to just
[20:40] consider the things that are happening
[20:42] so that's greater than a miracle you
[20:46] know or the miracles instant we all we
[20:49] want that but when you've got to just
[20:51] gradually take it if God gives it from
[20:54] day to day he just gets better and
[20:56] better and better going now somewhere to
[20:58] 1214 hours without anything connecting
[21:02] to the machine and as far as I
[21:04] understand when they got the machine
[21:05] owner is actually not working it's not
[21:07] doing anything you don't all that's just
[21:09] hooked up during cases needed but to do
[21:12] that and God is with us and we're
[21:14] thinking thank you Lord for your your
[21:17] healing in your deliverance in Jesus
[21:20] name okay seasons one called an apostle
[21:27] of Jesus Christ by the will of God to
[21:29] the Saints which are at Ephesus and to
[21:31] the faithful in Christ Jesus grace be to
[21:35] you and peace from God our Father and
[21:37] from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be
[21:40] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[21:41] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[21:43] spiritual blessings in heavenly
[21:45] places in Christ according as he has
[21:48] chosen us in him before the foundation
[21:50] of the world that we should be holy and
[21:54] without blame before him in love having
[21:57] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[22:00] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[22:02] according to the good pleasure of his
[22:04] will to the grace of the glory of hid to
[22:07] the praise of the glory of His grace
[22:09] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[22:12] blood in whom we have redemption through
[22:15] his blood the forgiveness of sins
[22:17] according to the riches of His grace
[22:19] we're in he hath bounded toward us and
[22:24] all wisdom and prudence having made
[22:27] known unto us the mystery of his will
[22:29] according to his good pleasure which he
[22:32] hath purposed in himself that in the
[22:34] dispensation now what is the mystery of
[22:37] his will
[22:37] prophet said to adopt us what that in
[22:40] the dispensation we're not nowhere
[22:44] dispensation listen we believe it we're
[22:47] in the life dispensation all right said
[22:51] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[22:52] of times he might gather together in one
[22:54] all things in Christ both which are in
[22:57] heaven and which are on earth even in
[23:00] him in whom also we have obtained an
[23:02] inheritance being predestinated
[23:05] according to the purpose of him who
[23:07] worketh all things after the counsel of
[23:09] his own will that we should be to the
[23:12] praise of his glory who has trusted in
[23:14] Christ in whom ye also trusted after
[23:17] that ye heard the word of truth the
[23:20] gospel of your salvation in whom also
[23:22] after that you believed you were sealed
[23:25] with that holy spirit of promise which
[23:29] is the earnest of our inheritance until
[23:31] the redemption of the purchased
[23:32] possession unto the praise of his glory
[23:35] you may be seated the Lord had his
[23:37] blessing to the reading of the word you
[23:45] could take Ephesians 1 and preach till
[23:50] eternity off of this and we may do it a
[23:54] little that's not right
[23:56] but we just finished our series on the
[24:01] statue of a perfect man and through
[24:03] there we kept constantly talking about
[24:06] explaining it you know trying to bring
[24:08] out like faith virtue knowledge
[24:11] temperance patience from Peter and then
[24:13] come over to Paul and pick up you know
[24:15] the adoptions and the things of his
[24:19] wording and bringing forth and where he
[24:22] would talk to the Galatians about you
[24:25] know the the fruits of the spirit is
[24:27] love joy peace all of that time together
[24:29] showing that Paul and Peter were both
[24:32] saying the same thing they were teaching
[24:35] the growth development of the Christian
[24:38] all right now so into that we you know
[24:41] we were thought we'd drop off of it but
[24:43] it just keeps coming back so we'll deal
[24:46] with adoption for a little bit to try to
[24:49] make sure in its I'm saying this with
[24:52] the honor and glory the Bible said in
[24:54] the mouth of two or three witnesses let
[24:56] everything be established well we talked
[24:58] about that Paul priests adoption well
[25:03] that's what Peter was preaching is just
[25:04] different wording you know and then
[25:07] brother Branham comes along to preach so
[25:09] there's your one two three well wait he
[25:12] no he just finished a little bit back to
[25:15] our own own adoption and things and in
[25:18] doing and then brother Bob's been down
[25:20] in the Sunday School class teaching
[25:22] Sunday school and talking about adoption
[25:24] so you know we just we just keep all
[25:27] that relating seemingly right around the
[25:30] connection of the time that where we're
[25:35] at now
[25:35] here's one thing I want you to really
[25:39] listen listen because this is what we're
[25:44] going to be talking about for some time
[25:47] so the random said that our biggest
[25:50] problem was what looking back we're
[25:56] looking forward right and failing to see
[26:02] comprehend understand what is taking
[26:06] place now
[26:08] all right now I'm gonna say this in the
[26:11] right way I hope it'll come out right do
[26:14] you say but I just don't see nothing
[26:16] well if you was back there in the Pais
[26:21] you didn't see anything because if you
[26:24] did you'd be ready to listen now all
[26:28] right so you didn't see anything dire
[26:30] you know what I mean move us back six
[26:35] months and then moves back 30 years move
[26:38] us back 50 years it said well yeah we
[26:42] saw it in the profit but nobody else see
[26:48] you admits it just as much if you go
[26:50] forward well we're looking to this if
[26:53] this don't happen then we're not there
[26:55] see so the profit was right when What
[26:59] did he say this is where we live in
[27:02] we're not living the past we appreciate
[27:05] that thank God for all of the thunder
[27:07] looking forward to the future yes we
[27:10] have things that we look forward to look
[27:12] forward to the great anointing great
[27:14] thing all right I believe in all of it
[27:17] but if we don't stand where we're at
[27:22] then the future will do us no good
[27:24] because when we get to the future would
[27:27] just say we don't believe it no because
[27:32] that's what we're saying now I don't see
[27:33] it if you can't see these things that's
[27:36] what I was just thinking about there the
[27:37] other day been thinking about it all
[27:39] this week there that the Prophet said
[27:41] you know the greatest miracle and to
[27:43] think what Dale Roberts has went through
[27:46] if you'd see pictures and seeing what
[27:49] was dire you know and now he's talking
[27:55] he's doing all kind of funny not wanting
[28:00] a hamburger
[28:01] he keeps requesting that hamburger and I
[28:05] don't think they can get it through the
[28:07] tubes but that's what he wants is a
[28:11] hamburger he can tell him it's too hot
[28:13] you can tell him everything he's talking
[28:16] to him you know her if you'd have been
[28:19] there when I was and see him laying
[28:21] there then you'd have to do is I done to
[28:23] turn to the wall and say Lord we commit
[28:27] it to you cause ain't nothing one of us
[28:31] can do he's so far gone until they said
[28:34] you know yourself and I was dark when
[28:36] the doctor said it it's a date no hope I
[28:40] said this thing no hope it's at this
[28:43] case we've proven that with this form
[28:46] and the doings and the age and the part
[28:48] he said they might live a year you know
[28:52] but he says there's just no no part he
[28:56] wanted to pull the plug
[28:57] as he we call it you know and pull off
[29:01] the life support well you know she says
[29:05] no and now he's doing all of these
[29:09] things I wonder what that doctor is
[29:10] doing right now I'd like to run into him
[29:12] in the hall wife sometimes ask him how
[29:14] he's feeling but you know okay he was
[29:17] doing his medical terminology so I going
[29:20] off on him and he was writing what he
[29:22] wasn't saying but see he didn't know God
[29:25] could move on the scene and start just
[29:29] okay setting up bringing him out letting
[29:32] him set up letting him do all kind of
[29:34] things it's just you know talk to Aaron
[29:36] and there's some of these about the
[29:37] things talked to Anna about it to where
[29:40] you know that you can just it's amazing
[29:42] okay all right because we believe in it
[29:45] that's what I'm saying down these
[29:48] thoughts that I'll be trying to make for
[29:50] quite a while will be based based upon
[29:52] what is taking place not what will take
[29:57] place
[29:59] or what has taken place alright so
[30:04] remember that you know and this think on
[30:08] these things okay now in adoption your
[30:11] profit called it
[30:13] I run series of it years ago and and
[30:16] things and tried to to cover the natural
[30:21] stories of adoption and things like that
[30:23] you know in doing it but just to cover
[30:25] it the way the Prophet brought it that
[30:28] in the Old Testament there was a time
[30:32] called adoption that a child a boy you
[30:36] know now sorry sisters who don't cover
[30:39] sisters this covers boys no it's done to
[30:43] cover that see we're in a different
[30:45] dispensation alright in this one it's
[30:47] for women and men you know it's not just
[30:52] for the men okay so don't try to diss
[30:55] Kurt get discouraged or excuse the fact
[30:59] of saying well we don't have to do this
[31:01] we we're women and you know that don't
[31:03] work it's all in the body because that's
[31:06] why I was reading Ephesians that were
[31:08] brought where Paul covers all of us Jew
[31:14] and Gentile you know into this Ephesians
[31:19] to show you because he really
[31:21] technically the first or the thought of
[31:24] adoption was for Israel the scripture
[31:28] you know pertains to adoption literally
[31:31] is made it related to Israel because it
[31:33] was a natural thing they had the natural
[31:37] story of adoption they went through that
[31:40] in their families they done that before
[31:44] Jesus Christ came into the existence
[31:46] they had the the adoption are the what
[31:50] Bar Mitzvah hey I got clothes on there
[31:55] yeah
[31:56] and I can pronounce that word sometime
[31:58] all right but we were there in Israel
[32:02] and had an opportunity to view this
[32:04] taking place their own one of the
[32:07] accounts of where we were there in
[32:09] Israel when this boy was going through
[32:11] his ceremony and everything standing
[32:14] there on in an area so we happened to be
[32:16] able to walk by and we saw that and it
[32:19] was great you know alright but now to
[32:21] think about it they had something in
[32:25] order of the natural things all right
[32:30] they had a natural situation that they
[32:33] would do that would do the child was
[32:36] born into the family all right
[32:39] he was part of the family but he was not
[32:43] positioned in the position of
[32:46] understanding our authority and whatever
[32:49] and he was given a tutor or a trainer
[32:52] you know and say we cover some of those
[32:55] customs today and do some of those
[32:57] things and put our children under
[32:59] teachers or tutors and things like that
[33:02] you know to help them and that's what
[33:04] they had back there all right then when
[33:07] the child came up to the basis of of
[33:10] age-wise or whatever really really
[33:12] wasn't age it would be maturity as to
[33:17] being used more than anything and if
[33:19] you've got a Scofield Bible I'd like for
[33:21] you to just read or I'll read it right
[33:23] here from it on this word of adoption to
[33:27] where that will love be able to
[33:30] understand this great big old long word
[33:32] means placing as a son now listen to
[33:36] what Scofield says it means it's not so
[33:39] much a word now this big ol long word
[33:43] for the adoption is not so much a word
[33:47] of relationship as of position
[33:52] you got Scofield Bible you can read
[33:54] right down on the left inside the page
[33:56] where you learn in the seasons
[34:00] the believers relationship to God as a
[34:03] child Reserve results from the new birth
[34:08] all right
[34:10] whereas adoption is the act of God
[34:13] whereby one already a child is through
[34:17] Redemption from the law placed in the
[34:20] position of an adult son the indwelling
[34:25] Spirit gives the realization of this in
[34:28] the believers present experience okay
[34:31] because it goes from over into love joy
[34:34] peace but the full manifestation of the
[34:36] believers sonship awaits the
[34:38] resurrection now listen the full
[34:43] manifestation of the believers sonship
[34:47] awaits the resurrection the change the
[34:52] translation of the Saints which is
[34:54] called the redemption of the body all
[34:58] right so then see the word very word
[35:01] itself for therefore adoption shows what
[35:05] that was so I was born a child born into
[35:11] the family raised up awhile been given a
[35:14] tutor you know and that tutor trained
[35:17] that child to try to instill into the
[35:20] child the nature of the father and then
[35:23] they would would come forth as to having
[35:26] their ceremonies and the things you can
[35:29] take it if you're real careful over to
[35:33] Joseph and his coat of many colors and
[35:36] the showing that he was the chosen one
[35:39] among but just remember now in the
[35:42] natural story of the adoption probably
[35:46] each one of the children of Jacob and
[35:49] them was adopted naturally it would have
[35:51] been you know as they become to their
[35:54] maturity point but then you would how
[35:56] Joseph being picked as the the son you
[36:00] know to be the extra and you can use
[36:02] that as an example because it comes
[36:04] forth more into you and I can't remember
[36:06] what it does it doesn't make adoption
[36:11] doesn't make or did not make a child
[36:14] of child of the family they were born to
[36:18] child of the family
[36:19] all right they were born that child of
[36:22] the family it only made them positioned
[36:26] positionally further their maturity and
[36:31] with that went things that they had are
[36:37] enjoyed because we know the profits
[36:41] covered it if they if they and I'll read
[36:43] them to you if they matured all right
[36:47] they received those things but if they
[36:49] didn't mature they remind a child but
[36:52] they remind a child without a position
[36:55] or authority are are the the staff of a
[36:59] CEOs the the things that was given to
[37:02] the son as he came to that position all
[37:06] right but now that's what I want you to
[37:08] look at there's reason I want to
[37:10] approach it as the adoption to the whole
[37:13] point because he in that you have no
[37:17] example after that in other words that
[37:21] son was a son that was it
[37:22] you ended your adoption or taught in the
[37:27] Old Testament okay everybody follow me
[37:31] now in the Old Testament your type was
[37:34] or what happened was the son was born
[37:37] into the family and then the son was
[37:40] positioned of authority into the family
[37:45] but it didn't run on over and deal with
[37:49] what we would want to do with in the
[37:51] natural of trying to make some form of
[37:53] inheritance it's not dealing with that
[37:57] there in the Old Testament cause it only
[38:00] dealt with those two things born into
[38:02] the family positioned maturity alright
[38:07] maturity but now maturity then speaks of
[38:11] doing and that's what I want you to
[38:13] think about see then Paul could pick up
[38:15] the Old Testament the whereas maybe
[38:20] Peter in second Peter with you know he
[38:23] had his great understand he brought what
[38:25] God wanted this to house but he didn't
[38:27] go in through the adoption little stages
[38:30] of things in in his teaching all right
[38:34] because maybe he didn't understand that
[38:36] but Paul knew the Old Testament rules
[38:39] and regulations they don't anything else
[38:42] he knew that the ends and out of the Old
[38:44] Testament he knew about the law and what
[38:46] it means and what it was doing
[38:48] and he tried to bring that over into the
[38:50] New Testament all right see Peter
[38:53] couldn't have went back you get my point
[38:55] Peter couldn't went back and necessarily
[38:57] brought you over from types and shadows
[38:59] he didn't deal with types and shadows
[39:02] he dealt with literal wordings faith
[39:06] perks or knowledge temperance patience
[39:07] got in this thing he that was literal
[39:10] wordings that was bringing forth and
[39:14] showing what was to be able to taking
[39:15] place whereas Paul was dealing with the
[39:19] positional things or the growth
[39:20] development of that child to that
[39:24] position but now remember this this
[39:26] listen and it'll help you later on as we
[39:29] try to say and you say well what I meant
[39:31] was that now see you had your stages of
[39:36] the new birth you can type that with
[39:39] Paul as he'll do in a minute now but
[39:43] there must be something to move on
[39:45] because if we don't catch the story we
[39:49] will wind up and get into a position and
[39:52] be like we was that I said and the
[39:54] warning was what looking back looking
[40:01] forward see we'll come up to a position
[40:04] to where we will freeze on the point of
[40:08] doing instead of seeing that the more of
[40:11] what needs to be seen as you bring from
[40:15] the Old Testament over into the New
[40:18] Testament and how that is amplified
[40:22] magnified glorified into the
[40:24] putting of the word to show us where
[40:27] we're at and watch to take place now all
[40:30] right because see you've got that
[40:35] authority back there that Old Testament
[40:39] child had that authority given to them
[40:42] to place them as sons and daughters of
[40:46] God but now whereas Paul carries it and
[40:51] that's why I read that the Paul carries
[40:56] it on into a greater thing now you get
[41:00] what I'm saying listen in the Old
[41:03] Testament you never come to a
[41:04] resurrection I mean you had a son and
[41:07] you had authority in the examples but
[41:09] isn't it stopped
[41:11] Paul carries it into the resurrection
[41:17] right that's what we were reading here
[41:20] we're pulses that were asked to covering
[41:23] through the resurrection to the change
[41:24] of the body there's things in the New
[41:27] Testament see that are not in the Old
[41:28] Testament all right so as we're dealing
[41:31] with it don't get froze between and so
[41:34] which ones that would the once we cross
[41:37] the stage we cross into the New
[41:39] Testament and in our New Testament
[41:41] thinking will be based upon that and
[41:44] you'll find a lot more interesting story
[41:46] than to just read a story of what a
[41:48] child was back there you might see that
[41:51] act out on the play and like I said
[41:54] we've got to see it they were doing
[41:56] things and had bread and had different
[41:58] things and and best I remember they
[42:00] might have been a young girl or two it
[42:03] was about three or four people because
[42:05] we were standing at a wall and they were
[42:07] doing that all right but now listen to
[42:10] what I'm saying them when you got an
[42:14] example a top a top can only work to a
[42:20] certain position that's my whole point
[42:24] Paul can take that though and see that
[42:29] type
[42:31] back there and bring it into the New
[42:35] Testament dispensation and take you
[42:38] further than to just be birth Authority
[42:44] oh that's wonderful
[42:46] birthing authority and that's great in
[42:48] the body of Christ it's great to see
[42:50] Christ living among us but this is not
[42:53] the end in the New Testament adoption
[42:55] doesn't end in the New Testament with
[42:57] just a maturity I know the world waiting
[43:03] we know all that we'll get to it waiting
[43:05] on the manifestation of the sons of God
[43:07] right but still there is things to
[43:11] happen after then there's a change
[43:13] there's a resurrection there's great
[43:15] things to take place there in the
[43:21] adoption all series all right now so
[43:25] getting the point now let's let's think
[43:26] about it
[43:27] Paul as I said he picks this up now and
[43:32] he's using the top
[43:35] he's making the tops and shadows out of
[43:38] it showing what it means
[43:40] so he's Paul is going we're gonna read
[43:42] these where Paul is going to be relating
[43:44] that this is a birth this is a maturity
[43:51] it'll be in his right so let's go ahead
[43:54] and pick up the talk and get started on
[43:57] it then so let's go to go ahead a number
[44:01] of one a which is galatians 4
[44:06] excuse-me relations 3 now watch Paul
[44:12] take this example explain the example
[44:20] show the tops ok then he'll take it into
[44:27] a higher form than she just stopped on
[44:33] that if he didn't owe you and how would
[44:38] be the new birth and your your authority
[44:44] see now Paul explains that but then he
[44:48] takes it into the change and the things
[44:50] later on in his writings but we have to
[44:55] cover it to where we can understand
[44:57] what's now but before faith came we were
[45:00] kept under the law in other words that's
[45:02] under the Old Testament shut up unto the
[45:04] faith which should afterwards be
[45:06] revealed okay which would be Jesus
[45:08] Christ coming were for the law and the
[45:12] once was our schoolmaster to bring us to
[45:17] Christ that we might be justified by
[45:20] faith
[45:21] well now Paul is explaining the Old
[45:26] Testament that's that's this
[45:28] schoolmaster was the Old Testament
[45:30] former tutor all right now he's
[45:34] explaining that to bring it into order
[45:36] for us to see honor would you realize
[45:39] that here's where brother branham's he
[45:42] covers things that people they don't
[45:44] want to listen to we talk about the law
[45:47] bringing us to Christ
[45:49] brother branham Center denominations was
[45:52] a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ oh
[45:59] no we don't want not to do it alone
[46:03] you don't want nothing to do with what
[46:06] brought you to Christ so you go blow a
[46:09] nice overthrow you you blow our mind
[46:12] because we're getting settled in what
[46:13] we're thinking and then you flop us with
[46:15] something like that we don't believe any
[46:16] of their emanations being able to
[46:18] anything not to the nominations god of
[46:27] the age and time that was being lived
[46:32] you don't believe that they was a diet a
[46:35] time when the Lutheran's was the Word of
[46:36] God you don't believe that the
[46:41] Methodists that one day was the actual
[46:43] working of God see that's what I'm
[46:47] saying brother Branham will say things
[46:48] and all it takes is a word to collect
[46:51] you know to click it in the right place
[46:53] then he'll save them denomination to the
[46:56] schoolmaster
[46:59] see then we would get all confused the
[47:04] instead of listening to what he's saying
[47:06] are getting the understanding of what
[47:08] he's saying and then watch or for the
[47:12] law and what about the law being your
[47:15] schoolmaster the law was spiritual we
[47:29] are the ones in the corner the law was
[47:34] the Word of God but we don't want
[47:37] nothing to do with law with the will
[47:39] blender of that law stuff the law was
[47:43] what brought you to Christ you had no
[47:46] knowledge of sin without the law come on
[47:54] then we just take something and we we
[47:57] just throw it out and we think we
[47:59] understand instead of listening and
[48:03] thinking about what is being said Paul
[48:08] the law was our schoolmaster you know
[48:15] that actually the law the perfect Word
[48:19] of God now brought Christ into existence
[48:30] don't throw away the law come on church
[48:36] we still believe in the law I still
[48:39] believe I shall not kill thou shalt not
[48:41] steal thou shalt not lie I still believe
[48:43] that don't you
[48:45] you think we're coming to the new
[48:46] testament so it's okay for us to do all
[48:47] these time Paul said the law was
[48:52] spiritual
[48:56] well I don't know I so love it when you
[49:00] don't know what you're talking about the
[49:05] law was the Word of God brother Branham
[49:08] said the ten commandments was God in
[49:10] letter form you need that one God in
[49:17] letter form okay cuz now listen if
[49:26] adoption was not had been taught in the
[49:30] Old Testament you would not have
[49:31] something for the New Testament to top
[49:33] off of right but it was taught perfectly
[49:38] to her that it would come forth are
[49:40] naturally into an example for us but
[49:47] never never do away let her run said
[49:49] that law see what we think law is dirty
[49:53] words you know law we're not under the
[49:58] law we're under grace we weep and then
[50:04] the Prophet say that your denominations
[50:08] was a schoolmaster
[50:12] placing it like the law was a
[50:14] schoolmaster that was the law school
[50:20] master the law was what led you to Jesus
[50:25] Christ Paul said I had not known sin had
[50:30] the law not said thou shalt not covet
[50:37] listen wherefore the law is our
[50:40] schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ how
[50:43] did you get to Christ cool how did you
[50:50] get to cross I started getting to it by
[50:55] the law within you didn't get that cuz
[50:57] that's what the scripture says no you're
[51:01] gonna argue in the inside the scripture
[51:05] says plainly right there in front of you
[51:07] that allows our schoolmaster to bring us
[51:09] to Christ something had to bring us to
[51:12] Christ a knowledge of sin a conviction
[51:23] was brought forth by the law but there
[51:27] was nothing back there to be able to
[51:29] take it any further
[51:33] would this become condemnation but Paul
[51:40] picks it up to take it and explain what
[51:43] happened in Jesus Christ
[51:46] truth in the law was our schoolmaster to
[51:49] bring us to Christ I thought brother
[51:52] Brennan says it Leslie how did he place
[51:54] it the I thought he said two prophets
[51:57] brought the word
[51:59] I thought the prophets were the laws and
[52:02] he said they was one that brought the
[52:04] word right not change our thoughts about
[52:10] sometime look but after that faith has
[52:14] come in other words after you gets a new
[52:16] birth now we're no longer under a
[52:19] schoolmaster once you get the new birth
[52:23] you're not under a schoolmaster the
[52:25] schoolmaster is dwelling within you
[52:28] you're not under a book of rules the
[52:31] rules would come into our heart as a
[52:32] revelation of Jesus Christ
[52:40] where we're the children of God by faith
[52:44] in Jesus Christ not a lineage and then
[52:49] what he's explaining it's not a lineage
[52:51] it's not this that any of it
[52:52] it's in Jesus Christ where as many as
[52:57] have been baptized into Christ have put
[52:59] on Christ now watch him as I said a
[53:04] moment ago see there is neither then
[53:07] what Jew the Greek neither bond nor free
[53:11] there's neither male nor female for you
[53:15] are all one in Christ if you be Christ's
[53:19] then you're Abraham's seed and heirs
[53:23] according to the promise the Paul is
[53:27] going to take the Old Testament adoption
[53:34] of the natural ciao and explaining that
[53:40] that that natural child gets a tutor a
[53:44] schoolmaster the word is interchangeable
[53:47] if from the hour down to the word
[53:49] schoolmaster to be used in the next
[53:52] verse
[53:52] it's an interchangeable word don't worry
[53:54] about I've looked it up don't think well
[53:56] it was a schoolmaster here but it was
[53:58] that over here now it's a tutor it's a
[54:00] schoolmaster the law was our tutor to
[54:04] bring us to Christ
[54:07] it was our schoolmaster to hold us until
[54:11] Christ could come to give us the new
[54:13] birth right so that wasn't a dirty word
[54:23] so Paul what are you doing all right
[54:26] what I'm doing I'm trying to tell you
[54:28] that those things are that Old Testament
[54:31] happening of the adoption that you're
[54:34] wanting to talk about you know
[54:37] it's correct a child is a child when
[54:40] it's born a child and then its maturity
[54:43] comes into its life and until that does
[54:46] it's given a tutor to bring it to the
[54:50] place of raising it and the tutor is the
[54:54] law a school last year
[55:02] now come on words none of us didn't like
[55:05] our school teachers when they got rough
[55:06] right you know we thought this all means
[55:11] but today we finish school we look back
[55:16] and said thank you to the teacher right
[55:19] especially if you wanted to advance
[55:21] further and go on in life you know and
[55:23] do it but get what I'm saying Paul is
[55:29] using an example to explain what happens
[55:36] in the fact that Jesus Christ had to
[55:40] come and die because the law could hold
[55:45] us but it couldn't deliver us it
[55:50] couldn't set us free more we got out of
[55:55] it the more we've done this and done
[55:57] that and didn't do this then do that
[55:58] that didn't save us at all
[56:04] those things spoke of it
[56:08] well now watch what he says go ahead a
[56:11] number to the next one
[56:13] one be there always no one got the 181 B
[56:20] that means is it added later and watch
[56:26] we just finished verse 29 of the third
[56:31] chapter now we go to the fourth now I
[56:34] say that the air as long as he's a child
[56:40] differeth nothing from a servant though
[56:43] he be Lord of all
[56:44] now he's explaining the son that was
[56:50] born a son the child that's born the son
[56:55] he's not explaining the authority in
[56:57] this he's explaining sonship and
[57:02] explaining the new birth the new birth
[57:05] is what makes us sonship right now
[57:10] listen now I say that the heir in other
[57:14] words there's a man he's got a child
[57:17] he's got every right to the inheritance
[57:20] he's a child of the father he's born
[57:23] into the family he's ready for things
[57:25] correct his papers is correct he's in
[57:27] the ladies he's in everything but now
[57:29] watch him
[57:32] even though he's err he's got a problem
[57:38] as long as he's a child he can't claim
[57:42] that relationship he can't claim
[57:46] Authority as long as he's a child
[57:49] so is it within you we get born again
[57:53] and in the body that's what brother
[57:54] Brennan said that's he said that's what
[57:55] people to do he said they they're born
[57:57] to get on Saturday night and said Sunday
[57:59] morning they're in the pulpit preaching
[58:01] have you heard him say that he said
[58:05] that's not right yeah but you go tell
[58:10] him he can't preach I didn't say that I
[58:12] said I'm gonna tell him that right
[58:13] according to the Bible I knew him just
[58:16] like I do the woman she comes look said
[58:18] well God called me okay that's between
[58:20] you and God Danny between me and you and
[58:21] God that's your problem I'm gonna stay
[58:26] with the word we ain't gonna let the
[58:28] preach no
[58:31] who sat down and listened the main thing
[58:35] alright alright so now watch what he's
[58:39] saying that the air even though he's
[58:42] born into the family now
[58:46] so even though now hold this point if we
[58:49] get to it even though you're born into
[58:51] the family by the baptism of the Holy
[58:53] Ghost that gives you eternal life makes
[58:58] you a child of God that can never be
[59:00] taken from you but that's not all the
[59:05] word is trying to deal with there's more
[59:08] to it than that
[59:09] okay so look so that the air in other
[59:13] words the rightful owner
[59:15] air as long as he's a child differeth
[59:18] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[59:20] of all but he's under tutors and
[59:27] governors until the time appointed of
[59:30] the Father he's under schoolmaster the
[59:34] same word appears here back it's the
[59:37] same word he's under a tutor than words
[59:40] we never have been through that to know
[59:43] that much about it but a lot of people
[59:45] you know they they take a tutor they
[59:47] they send her child to a school and they
[59:49] put a tutor over that child to train
[59:51] that child and bring that child up to
[59:53] positions and things and all like that
[59:56] ready they're still doing it around the
[59:58] country raising them giving them a tutor
[1:00:02] all right and it's a child so he gets
[1:00:07] the tutor now brother branham said God
[1:00:09] gave us a tutor at the baptism when the
[1:00:11] only go he said that's a grace to
[1:00:12] greatest tutor of all there's a new
[1:00:15] birth we'll see all that does now just
[1:00:20] puts us in the body across
[1:00:24] that's what brother Aaron said you
[1:00:26] Pentecostals made you a mistake
[1:00:29] he said thanking you got everything when
[1:00:32] you were born again he said now you just
[1:00:33] started well no wonder they didn't want
[1:00:38] him
[1:00:43] but is under tutors and governors until
[1:00:45] the time appointed of the Father you
[1:00:46] know what is the time of the father
[1:00:48] would finally say okay son he's you know
[1:00:51] the tutor would come in and say to the
[1:00:52] father
[1:00:53] now he's raised up it's time for his
[1:00:56] going through his ceremony and things
[1:00:58] because he he's writing then the father
[1:01:01] would check the that's under see if he
[1:01:03] had the nature well you know what I like
[1:01:07] about it in the natural I mean that's
[1:01:09] that's my way of thinking I've always
[1:01:12] said I don't want my kids to act like
[1:01:14] the neighbor you know a lot of times
[1:01:16] kids act like father and in mama you
[1:01:19] know then walking you ever notice you
[1:01:21] watch your kids sometimes and you'll see
[1:01:23] them they'll be walking and they're
[1:01:25] walking they look at walking just like
[1:01:26] you walk in they're acting like you're
[1:01:30] acting well you don't want them acting
[1:01:32] like the neighbor because you might
[1:01:34] think they wind up belonging to the
[1:01:36] neighbor right cuz they're acting like
[1:01:39] the neighbor well alright so the tutor
[1:01:43] would not you know the the father
[1:01:45] wouldn't give a tutor to raise the child
[1:01:47] to act like the neighbor he'd want him a
[1:01:51] tutor that would acting like him he
[1:01:53] wanted his nature how is it with you
[1:01:55] that have been in through these things
[1:01:56] and you had it or they put the tutor
[1:01:58] with you see actually their tutors when
[1:02:00] it passes of grades you know the class
[1:02:02] is not you that the tutor cuz that tutor
[1:02:05] instills into you what you supposed to
[1:02:06] answer the questions okay it's natural
[1:02:09] listening what is under tutors and
[1:02:11] governors now watch him even so we when
[1:02:15] we were children babies we're in bondage
[1:02:22] under the elements of the world
[1:02:30] in other words two parts first off if
[1:02:34] you just an hour without a birth you're
[1:02:37] under the elements of the world
[1:02:38] automatically not automatically under
[1:02:43] the elements of the world okay but now
[1:02:45] in the spiritual the tutor is not only
[1:02:48] to try to train you in the nature he's
[1:02:49] to try to help you to be able to survive
[1:02:52] in the world that you're living in right
[1:02:54] because that's what he's talking about
[1:02:56] we're in bondage under the elements of
[1:02:58] the world now to bring that up into a
[1:03:02] spiritual whether you like this or not
[1:03:05] that's all right put it in the seat of
[1:03:06] your britches and sit down on it when
[1:03:08] you start as a new birth you start as a
[1:03:10] baby I don't care if you're 80 years old
[1:03:14] you're a baby
[1:03:16] you know what you act like a baby right
[1:03:20] you think like a baby that's where the
[1:03:23] troubles that we try to take our
[1:03:25] thoughts like a baby and claim to be a
[1:03:27] dog and I don't need that old loner
[1:03:30] nothing I've never been I tell you what
[1:03:33] I've sanctified in feel the Holy Ghost I
[1:03:36] don't I don't need no law you might find
[1:03:46] out for this series it over that if that
[1:03:50] tutor was not a teacher of the truth of
[1:03:54] the law that was the nature that was
[1:03:56] wanted then the farmer wanted instilled
[1:03:59] into his son so it might be something
[1:04:02] that you won't listen so we when we were
[1:04:05] children
[1:04:06] we're in bondage under the elements of
[1:04:08] the world but when the fullness of time
[1:04:09] was come God sent forth his son made of
[1:04:12] a woman made under the law to do what to
[1:04:16] redeem them that were under the law that
[1:04:18] we might receive the adoption of sons
[1:04:25] if we don't get in the right lineage we
[1:04:27] can't have the adoption so what's the
[1:04:30] adoption first there's got to be a child
[1:04:33] first you've got to be born again then
[1:04:37] you come into the right of adoption in
[1:04:39] other words you start your maturity
[1:04:42] you're born again baby yeah like a baby
[1:04:47] cry like one you know a baby it's not
[1:04:55] that what we've taught is that not the
[1:04:57] way the Prophet is teaching the message
[1:04:59] of the hour and how that you're born as
[1:05:02] a child of God yes that gives you the
[1:05:07] new birth yes that gives you faith then
[1:05:10] Peter says now come on let's grow up and
[1:05:13] be adults
[1:05:15] Paul says let's get into adoption stages
[1:05:19] with it and see that adoption is the
[1:05:22] same thing Peter is talking about
[1:05:24] because you're adding faith works or
[1:05:26] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[1:05:27] coming out with love joy peace goodness
[1:05:30] meekness and all coming out with those
[1:05:34] virtues and Paul is telling you how to
[1:05:38] become an adopted son he's using the Old
[1:05:42] Testament as an example that that child
[1:05:46] is born into the family Metheny has to
[1:05:49] come through the maturity stages and
[1:05:51] have a tutor but if that tutor is not
[1:05:55] satisfied with the student the student
[1:05:58] don't pass the test
[1:06:02] brother Branham says now this is his
[1:06:04] word so I don't know whether that's I
[1:06:06] don't know whether that you say well
[1:06:07] okay that son and you you flunked this
[1:06:10] one so we'll send you back through again
[1:06:12] I don't read in the Bible where there's
[1:06:14] a back seat back in again okay maybe you
[1:06:18] can but I can't find that okay I can't
[1:06:21] find if I fail it here maybe I can make
[1:06:23] it over here alright you with me in
[1:06:28] other words if I can't follow it and
[1:06:30] come out as a true Christian I don't
[1:06:32] think being coming out of foolish
[1:06:34] virgins gonna help me you understand me
[1:06:37] there is no point of doing and if we
[1:06:40] don't make it in and brother branham now
[1:06:41] their wording is what he said if that
[1:06:44] child didn't become a child he said it
[1:06:45] stayed a child was that it had no
[1:06:48] authority now he doesn't cover there's a
[1:06:53] second stage that he can run back
[1:06:54] through that again if it is now you
[1:06:57] showed me I want you to bring it to me
[1:06:59] where he says you can start back over
[1:07:00] know it evident it was pretty strong
[1:07:04] like that child if he flunked the first
[1:07:07] one he didn't get a second change we try
[1:07:11] to make a lot of things in the word
[1:07:12] that's not in there all right now
[1:07:14] bank-owned these thing but see when the
[1:07:18] fullness of time was come God sent forth
[1:07:21] his son made of a woman made under the
[1:07:26] law to do what to bring us to Christ
[1:07:30] Jesus Christ came to be the fulfillment
[1:07:33] of law he came to magnify the law uh how
[1:07:36] is it let's see this three-fourth honey
[1:07:38] he came to increase it's magnified you
[1:07:41] know of the law he didn't do away with
[1:07:45] the law Christ in the new birth that's
[1:07:50] what the Bible says Christ is the end of
[1:07:52] the law for righteousness
[1:07:57] if you're born again with you're not
[1:07:59] born again it don't work unless they
[1:08:03] don't think I try to put all these
[1:08:04] things in I know you said well you just
[1:08:06] give us such everything I try to give
[1:08:10] you the information enough to where you
[1:08:11] can understand if we don't make it in
[1:08:15] Gardo stage 1 are we gonna try stage 2
[1:08:20] ain't gonna be satisfied I don't know
[1:08:22] what you think if I don't make it as the
[1:08:25] Bride of Christ I want I don't want to
[1:08:29] have to appear somewheres else right if
[1:08:35] I have to that's between God that's his
[1:08:37] business he can do what he wants to but
[1:08:39] I it's not up to me to do that I don't
[1:08:41] want nothing left over just in case this
[1:08:44] don't work right I remember years ago
[1:08:49] when we first started coming into the
[1:08:51] message and a lot of money started
[1:08:53] floating around
[1:08:54] well found out a lot of the preachers
[1:08:55] were sending their money to the foreign
[1:08:57] fields we're putting them in Western
[1:08:58] and/or eastern bank accounts what far
[1:09:01] just in case we don't make it you got
[1:09:08] any sent over there just in case you
[1:09:10] don't make it well ain't no we're not to
[1:09:17] plan just in case we don't like it
[1:09:19] that's up to God and his doing they left
[1:09:24] for us we've got one choice make it or
[1:09:26] not
[1:09:27] okay come on I won't charge you for that
[1:09:30] one all right to redeem them that were
[1:09:34] under the law that we might receive the
[1:09:37] adoption
[1:09:41] nopal covered it over in Romans we'll
[1:09:43] get to it later called it's the spirit
[1:09:45] of adoption see when you were born again
[1:09:51] you're given the spirit of adoption that
[1:09:54] doesn't mean your adoption is complete
[1:09:58] that means that you're given the spirit
[1:10:00] to carry you through making you a child
[1:10:04] of God all right now here what are we
[1:10:07] saying not back not forward the spirit
[1:10:12] of adoption is here now we're right now
[1:10:15] being concerned with whether or not
[1:10:16] we're trying to go up that statue of a
[1:10:18] perfect man that's what's happening
[1:10:22] right now that was not yesterday an hour
[1:10:24] tomorrow
[1:10:25] it's what's taking place now if we don't
[1:10:30] see him now in bad shape now listen this
[1:10:34] is one of one I like because your son's
[1:10:38] this one was in mass confusion four
[1:10:41] years ago I remember it because your
[1:10:44] son's God has sent forth the spirit of
[1:10:46] his son into your heart crying now by
[1:10:48] father because you are son well this
[1:10:51] signs out alone
[1:10:55] now it's nineteen seventy's well we've
[1:11:00] always been this well what we doing here
[1:11:06] now I mean if that be true what are we
[1:11:09] doing here fifty years later I mean
[1:11:11] after that point you know but listen
[1:11:14] we're for the art no more to serve it
[1:11:16] but a son and if a son then an heir of
[1:11:19] God through Christ what about it Paul
[1:11:23] what are you doing I'm taking the Old
[1:11:26] Testament of the example of a child born
[1:11:31] into the family made him a member of the
[1:11:34] family never can be disowned or taken
[1:11:39] out there in a member of the family all
[1:11:42] right
[1:11:42] then dealing with positionally placing
[1:11:47] you in adoption all right
[1:11:50] he said I'm trying to define that now
[1:11:53] with the scriptures because we've got to
[1:11:57] bring it up so he brings it up that the
[1:11:59] new birth makes you a child of God the
[1:12:06] new birth makes you with eternal life a
[1:12:11] child of God makes you an heir of all
[1:12:15] things as he'll cover in the Romans
[1:12:17] joint heirs with Jesus Christ wonderful
[1:12:21] thing to make you what God wants you to
[1:12:23] be which is his child Paul says now that
[1:12:27] adoption back there only put the son
[1:12:32] in the line of maturity or our business
[1:12:38] wise you know the things of given
[1:12:43] Authority it didn't change that child
[1:12:50] now come on listen to me for a second
[1:12:53] so that tutor Dyer had a hard problem
[1:12:57] because he was dealing with the nature
[1:13:00] of that child no back before Calvary and
[1:13:04] then I listened the child is born into
[1:13:07] the family but the tutor what do you
[1:13:10] think about that tutor having to try to
[1:13:12] raise that child without having anything
[1:13:15] to do with it because there was no new
[1:13:20] birth in the child there's only a
[1:13:25] natural birth right the child had a
[1:13:30] natural birth brought it into a member
[1:13:33] of the family gave it inheritance right
[1:13:38] because there were certain things that
[1:13:40] would be left that's why I love the
[1:13:42] story of the Bible to work that people
[1:13:44] don't never listen to what you take
[1:13:47] Jacob and Esau
[1:13:53] when he so finds out what's happened
[1:13:58] right he doesn't give it all the way
[1:14:02] itself would he find out what happened
[1:14:06] then he said Lord I suggest something
[1:14:08] for me you know there was right Jacob
[1:14:16] turned around to Esau and blessed Esau
[1:14:19] and made him as to be a great Authority
[1:14:24] and out of him would come great lineages
[1:14:27] and out of him would come great but read
[1:14:29] your Bible he just didn't bless
[1:14:33] Jacob they're just blessed he blessed he
[1:14:39] saw he saw got an inheritance he still
[1:14:43] got it over I right now he's doing a
[1:14:45] revs and then people it's got all the
[1:14:47] money
[1:14:48] that's making you pay three dollars a
[1:14:49] gallon to get here today huh you think
[1:14:55] he ain't got control of you go ahead and
[1:14:57] get you a motel I'm not against people
[1:15:02] in there
[1:15:03] I'm just telling it like it is now the
[1:15:06] Vietnamese went ahead of hitting the
[1:15:08] meters by the fall the chicken houses I
[1:15:11] don't know what they want them for but I
[1:15:13] mean that guy's really got a reason you
[1:15:15] go down to a motel you're gonna you go
[1:15:18] to a service station like I've always
[1:15:21] told you you say oh they can't do
[1:15:23] anything to us what if they said you
[1:15:27] would even recognize us or we won't sell
[1:15:31] you any more fuel
[1:15:36] you said that can't be done that can be
[1:15:39] done at any time what are you gonna do
[1:15:43] right if they own it
[1:15:48] you think they ain't behind us out there
[1:15:52] doing it too easy way they trying to
[1:15:54] fight us they just buying us out might
[1:15:57] be kind of like Russia since it will
[1:15:59] destroy you without firing a shot you
[1:16:01] know what they almost did had they
[1:16:05] demanded that today when Russia went
[1:16:08] underneath on the Christ market back
[1:16:10] under you know in lost their great
[1:16:12] country had they demanded the United
[1:16:14] States that day we would have been just
[1:16:16] as broke as Russia you think they ain't
[1:16:21] in control come on church I said okay I
[1:16:23] don't like to get on to that let's get
[1:16:26] off of that that's government I think I
[1:16:28] nothing to do with this well but listen
[1:16:32] Paul is expressing how important it is
[1:16:37] that you be born in an inheritance or a
[1:16:39] line and that puts you in a family and
[1:16:43] then he is expressing the authority that
[1:16:46] goes with sonship but he cannot express
[1:16:50] too much back there as two types of them
[1:16:54] things because it only ends with natural
[1:16:58] authorities right and the Old Testament
[1:17:03] it was just natural authorities it had
[1:17:06] nothing to do with why Scofield even
[1:17:08] picked it up he said that doesn't deal
[1:17:10] with resurrection yeah now Paul has
[1:17:15] happened to take the Old Testament
[1:17:20] an amplified magnified and deliver it
[1:17:24] and its way of delivering it was or what
[1:17:27] we just read in Galatians three and four
[1:17:29] that he's coming to show you that we
[1:17:33] have to get borned again to be in Christ
[1:17:38] for Christ to be in us we have to have
[1:17:40] the new burrow that makes us a child of
[1:17:42] God that puts us in right of inheritance
[1:17:47] with the father makes us right to where
[1:17:52] we're supposed to be but now he's saying
[1:17:54] you must have these other things that
[1:17:56] goes with it the authority is not
[1:18:00] dealing with this Authority - to have
[1:18:03] authority to be able to speak this into
[1:18:05] existence or that into existence
[1:18:09] so that's what everybody wants an
[1:18:11] adoption hey I remember I got a plan on
[1:18:15] the destined there now cuz I remember it
[1:18:17] and run some of them up I'm Dan you know
[1:18:19] called nothing girl to say it people
[1:18:22] were saying back in in the 68 and 69 Oh
[1:18:27] when we get into millennium we're gonna
[1:18:29] have manifested sons and daughters well
[1:18:34] anybody with one-eyed and highest senses
[1:18:35] brother Don rubber used to say I mean
[1:18:37] that's plain language that was his way
[1:18:39] of saying it
[1:18:39] anybody one-eyed and I said it sort of
[1:18:41] know that in the millennium you know
[1:18:44] that's fine the brother branham said we
[1:18:46] don't need it in the millennium he said
[1:18:48] we need it now he said we'll be in
[1:18:50] glorified bodies we'll see they were
[1:18:56] saying laughter I remember quoting that
[1:18:57] and they just what they didn't like it
[1:18:59] you know
[1:19:00] they we need it now yeah we're gonna
[1:19:03] have it the millennium we don't we don't
[1:19:04] need these now with where we got this we
[1:19:07] got that in the Millennium where I said
[1:19:08] probably said we didn't we don't need it
[1:19:10] in the millennium we need it now it's
[1:19:16] been hard to fight out a lot of truce
[1:19:17] and if you you wouldn't think about that
[1:19:20] has been filed out over the years until
[1:19:21] you're hollered and scream about these
[1:19:23] things
[1:19:23] try to get people to believe it but Paul
[1:19:27] takes then the example into a higher
[1:19:31] order then he brings it forth of a new
[1:19:35] birth yes but then he takes it forth
[1:19:38] more as to showing us the authority that
[1:19:41] goes with that birth the growth
[1:19:44] development that goes with it the
[1:19:47] adoption that comes with it the
[1:19:49] authority that goes with the tutor to
[1:19:53] teach us and train us to bring forth the
[1:19:56] nature of the Father the schoolmaster to
[1:19:59] bring us to Christ
[1:20:02] and bringing Christ into manifestation
[1:20:04] into our hearts and lives you say yeah
[1:20:10] but we got the new bird let's see yeah
[1:20:12] I'm months and they're trying to get you
[1:20:14] to look at that in a point you got the
[1:20:16] new bird a man you get the new birth
[1:20:18] you're born again glory but that don't
[1:20:21] stop that just puts the baby here that
[1:20:25] just gives the baby life it's not
[1:20:30] necessarily that we won't thority that's
[1:20:33] the problem everybody wants Authority or
[1:20:36] power apart from character was what the
[1:20:40] probably said it's satanic but he said
[1:20:43] power with a character it fit through we
[1:20:46] don't never hear that one everybody
[1:20:52] wants Authority and they only look at
[1:20:54] Authority come on not yesterday not
[1:21:00] tomorrow gotta bring this to a close
[1:21:04] right here on this and then we'll start
[1:21:05] over later everybody wants to Turin tea
[1:21:10] they think that's the way you show
[1:21:12] things I think well you you show who you
[1:21:16] are about your authority or your ability
[1:21:20] to do ain't gonna argue about it cuz I
[1:21:26] can stand here the rest of the afternoon
[1:21:27] talk about things that God is doing and
[1:21:31] I ain't dragging I'm just telling truth
[1:21:33] about it we can talk about the dead
[1:21:35] raised the sit healed we've talked about
[1:21:36] storms spoken in out we talked about
[1:21:38] many different things that has happened
[1:21:40] among us we can talk about miracles is
[1:21:43] right in one way right up there now
[1:21:48] medellín him coming forth more each day
[1:21:52] they said well who prayed that there's
[1:21:55] the problem there's the problem we've
[1:22:01] got to have the authority what does it
[1:22:05] matter who prayed the prayer how many
[1:22:09] times have we taken a prayer cloth for
[1:22:11] somebody's needs and give it back and
[1:22:13] pass it among everybody here to let
[1:22:17] everybody pray even the children pray
[1:22:19] over the prayer cloth
[1:22:21] but see we've got what I prayed that
[1:22:23] Peyer well I'm just gonna say it
[1:22:27] whether you like it or not if that's the
[1:22:30] attitude you got you didn't pray the
[1:22:32] prior now argue all you want to and fuss
[1:22:36] you didn't pray the prior somebody else
[1:22:38] did I got one Amen because you see when
[1:22:46] you start saying that I I me me me
[1:22:49] that's not an adoption the nature of the
[1:22:55] father being in there sealed into the
[1:22:56] Sun is not the nature of the neighbor
[1:23:02] right are you with me are you thanking
[1:23:11] but you don't believe in in authorities
[1:23:14] and then I believe in the greatest
[1:23:16] authority of one time
[1:23:24] go ahead click it and do you see I
[1:23:29] believe in the opening of the word I
[1:23:32] believe that the greatest example won't
[1:23:37] put it on and will back up the greatest
[1:23:39] example of adoption is not your signs
[1:23:41] and wonders you're going wrong you're in
[1:23:45] the devil's trap because in this day
[1:23:48] Satan can produce okay I believe the
[1:23:56] greatest sign that there is of an
[1:23:58] adoption is the word that's revealed to
[1:24:04] you that were in a day when all of this
[1:24:11] is falling apart until about the people
[1:24:15] of the message tell me this fall in the
[1:24:17] park Church is just people leaving just
[1:24:22] what did you stand there and say that
[1:24:26] ain't got nothing doing me they all fall
[1:24:32] away then I'll just praise God keep
[1:24:34] going what about you you gonna quit cuz
[1:24:38] everybody else quit I didn't start coda
[1:24:42] started
[1:24:47] what about it what would be the greatest
[1:24:51] what did brother Branham say what if the
[1:24:55] Bible say it will probably give you a
[1:24:58] signing to come to pass you better hear
[1:24:59] the prophet amen
[1:25:00] that's one scripture what about the
[1:25:02] second if the prophet gives you a sign
[1:25:06] and it comes to Pais and he leads you to
[1:25:09] another God don't hear him because I
[1:25:11] sent that among you to try you is that
[1:25:14] Bible give me somebody to stay with the
[1:25:19] word somebody just stay with the word it
[1:25:23] don't make no difference what anybody
[1:25:24] else says then we're not in the garbage
[1:25:30] can of everything and saying well this
[1:25:32] brother sewing so it's got this brother
[1:25:34] down on weenie
[1:25:35] we ain't none of that we're in one thing
[1:25:38] if the words are the power of God is
[1:25:41] automatically there give me that give me
[1:25:45] the word give me the word let me stay
[1:25:53] with it I told you of 40 years ago that
[1:25:59] they'd come a time that the
[1:26:01] denominations would be raising the dead
[1:26:03] healing the sick casting out Devils and
[1:26:05] that it would be in this message that
[1:26:07] people would be running after those
[1:26:09] doctrines and ideas I have no problem of
[1:26:15] saying I said it that's up to you to
[1:26:21] whether or not it's of God but let me
[1:26:24] they say it like this it doesn't matter
[1:26:26] whether some God or not if it worked
[1:26:30] now you don't like that and right come
[1:26:33] on you understand what I'm say if what I
[1:26:35] said is the truth even if I said it if
[1:26:38] the devil tells the truth he tells the
[1:26:41] truth you're going to be one of your
[1:26:47] prophets a tried by the what word
[1:27:00] see if you don't know whether or not the
[1:27:02] preachers preaching the truth where have
[1:27:04] you been studying God's Word
[1:27:12] come on musicians what about it
[1:27:15] we're just making a little point because
[1:27:17] my whole point is one thing I'll back it
[1:27:19] up to something that we're not gonna be
[1:27:21] back under then we're not gonna be over
[1:27:23] there
[1:27:24] we're gonna talk about what's here now
[1:27:27] and see if it's of God let's believe it
[1:27:32] if not then we just throw it away forget
[1:27:34] it
[1:27:36] I'll state my the final statement under
[1:27:39] this the greatest manifestation that
[1:27:43] they could ever be is a child of God to
[1:27:48] stay with God's Word
[1:27:50] in a time of all the troubles and
[1:27:53] heartaches and problems the times of all
[1:27:56] of the things following falling right
[1:27:59] and left and they just do it somebody
[1:28:02] just say thank God for the word but I
[1:28:09] love ain't nobody in the building lost
[1:28:11] feelings any better than this man I've
[1:28:13] told you I believe in them I believe
[1:28:18] that a baby that's got it in life is
[1:28:20] gonna have life about it you know what
[1:28:22] I'm saying if it's if it's alive it's
[1:28:24] gonna be alive we're gonna have emotions
[1:28:27] we're gonna have things amen called we
[1:28:29] believe in it but where is my emotion as
[1:28:32] opposed to being when it's compared to
[1:28:33] the word am I to check the word by my
[1:28:36] emotions and things and ideas are what's
[1:28:38] taking place or check it by what the
[1:28:41] Prophet said
[1:28:50] I say this with no disrespect I won't
[1:28:53] say it because I have been so guilty of
[1:28:55] bringing out things and exposing
[1:28:58] situations till you know I'll get water
[1:29:00] I don't believe it
[1:29:05] listen the greatest thing to know
[1:29:13] whether a child is the son or daughter
[1:29:15] of God is to how they deal with the word
[1:29:20] why did the prophets say he said they
[1:29:24] gave them the word test now how do you
[1:29:27] give the word test you know I know how
[1:29:30] y'all used to tell about giving the
[1:29:32] Pentecostal looking eyeball I discerned
[1:29:36] brother you out in ya
[1:29:41] but what is the greatest discernment
[1:29:44] that there is I thought the Bible said
[1:29:48] Hebrews 4 and way over that right that
[1:29:52] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[1:29:53] and intents of the heart
[1:29:56] what are we gonna try people by that
[1:30:01] comes behind preaches things to us what
[1:30:04] are you try it by but the words you've
[1:30:06] heard that's simple
[1:30:14] and then what do we do drama by the word
[1:30:18] see what to say what the prophet has to
[1:30:21] say oh but the dad was raised as sick
[1:30:22] was healed look at all these great
[1:30:24] miracles that's what the Bible said he
[1:30:27] said I'll do these things and send it
[1:30:29] among you to try you
[1:30:38] what a wonderful day let's time go ahead
