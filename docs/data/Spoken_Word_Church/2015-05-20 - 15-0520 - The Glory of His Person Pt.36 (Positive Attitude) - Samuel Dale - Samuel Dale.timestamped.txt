[3:16] all cases they have a thing that can
[3:19] help you as much as possible that they

[3:57] so call him and encourage him and I'm
[3:59] sure that it would help him amen all
[4:01] right Revelations
[4:04] 1 I hope you're beginning to pick up on
[4:07] the point of reading so much from
[4:09] Revelations 1 that to see that this is
[4:12] the picture of Jesus Christ down through
[4:16] time and the doings you know and all of
[4:18] these things and uh that's what we're
[4:21] we're trying our best to get you to see
[4:24] what's going on you know here in our
[4:27] part of the book verse 12 and I turned
[4:30] to see the voice that spake with me and
[4:32] being turned I saw seven golden
[4:34] candlesticks in the midst of the seven
[4:36] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[4:38] man clothed with a garment down to the
[4:40] foot and G about to pouch with a golden
[4:42] girdle his head and his hairs were white
[4:45] like wool as white as snow and his eyes
[4:48] were as a flame of fire and his feet
[4:51] like a Define brce as if they burned in
[4:54] a furnace and his voice as the sound of
[4:57] many Waters all right let's go over to
[5:01] First
[5:03] Peter and pick up which will be bringing
[5:07] our thought for tonight basically so
[5:09] we'll begin with Verse
[5:12] 18 for as much as you know that we were
[5:15] not redeemed with corruptible things as
[5:17] silver and gold from your vain
[5:19] conversation that means your conduct
[5:21] your manner of Life received by
[5:23] tradition from your fathers but with the
[5:26] precious blood of Christ as of a lamb
[5:28] without blemish and without spot who
[5:30] verely was for ordained before the
[5:32] foundation of the world but was manifest
[5:35] in these last times for you who by him
[5:38] do believe in God that raised him up
[5:41] from the dead and gave him glory that
[5:44] your Faith and Hope might be in God
[5:48] seeing you have purified your souls and
[5:50] obeying the truth through the spirit
[5:52] unto unfined love of the Brethren see
[5:55] that you love one another with a pure
[5:57] heart fervently what now being bornn
[6:00] again not of corruptible seed but of
[6:04] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[6:07] liveth and abideth forever job says I
[6:11] know my redeemer liveth because he had a
[6:15] positive attitude you may be seated the
[6:17] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[6:20] the word now I really enjoyed these
[6:24] brothers taking over and and doing the
[6:26] Wednesday services and things and really
[6:29] enjoyed them really enjoyed Wade's
[6:31] message or Sunday and he told me going
[6:34] up the road to hold off on what I was
[6:36] saying because I started talking about
[6:39] something and found out that's what he
[6:41] was going to preach on so uh you know
[6:43] we'll get around to our part of it later
[6:47] but the point that he was making Sunday
[6:49] was really a great thing you know it
[6:52] takes the blowing of the wind across
[6:55] your vocal cords to create
[6:58] words
[7:00] right amen you don't it's got to move
[7:04] that a across that vocal cord to make
[7:07] the word prede from your lips well see
[7:10] then we we'll get around to it where
[7:14] when he said let there be light we'll
[7:16] see more of what we're talking about all
[7:19] right but I want to make sure you follow
[7:22] me in the message Sunday afternoon I
[7:26] just kind of had to skip across and
[7:28] didn't give a lot of the quotes but I
[7:32] want to talk tonight about a positive
[7:35] attitude all right we'll get to that
[7:37] part when we get around to it and if you
[7:41] will by this coming Sunday maybe
[7:45] Wednesday but I'm sure this maybe this
[7:47] Sunday afternoon I wish you would listen
[7:50] or read the message who is this
[7:54] mzc because it will be very valuable in
[7:57] the next uh a couple of messages maybe
[8:01] after the morning service especially it
[8:04] will be very needful and notice in there
[8:08] the things that brother brandham shows
[8:11] the difference between Jesus Christ and
[8:15] you and I right and how everything comes
[8:17] into being so then that'll that will
[8:20] help to to understand but if you will
[8:23] listen to that by then you know but now
[8:26] what have we come down to talking about
[8:30] what is the new birth brother
[8:33] brandom Christ The Mystery of God
[8:35] revealed he said it's a revelation
[8:39] personally to you of Jesus Christ amen
[8:44] right now has God revealed to
[8:48] you and you say well it's so hard to get
[8:50] a revelation remember there's a quote in
[8:53] the Christ of mystery I've got it in
[8:56] here but brother brandham says that even
[8:58] the most most illiterate
[9:00] person can receive the new birth amen
[9:04] right so then it's not a head knowledge
[9:07] great thing that we think about as a
[9:11] revelation trying to be something like
[9:14] that it can be very very
[9:17] simple you know I've even expressed
[9:20] myself as to say like this that you know
[9:24] people always wonder well what is the
[9:26] seventh seal well make it a very simple
[9:28] thing
[9:30] I thought the prophet said it was the
[9:32] coming of the Lord right
[9:35] well what would he say in his
[9:40] coming they very simple I'm here
[9:44] right is that too
[9:47] simple you know you always talk about me
[9:49] being s
[9:50] deep to me that's the way I
[9:53] think you know in other words I say to
[9:56] you come to my house well when you
[9:58] arrive you're there
[9:59] that's right well that's very simple but
[10:02] see that's what it is in the new birth
[10:04] then it doesn't take a great big head
[10:08] knowledge with this lengthy Revelation
[10:11] to be able to say you got the new birth
[10:14] right but it takes a revelation of Jesus
[10:17] Christ personally to you
[10:19] amen all right then we gave the quotes
[10:22] from The Prophet there where he's
[10:23] talking about he said you can only be
[10:26] saved by revelation
[10:31] see then there's no way of being saved
[10:33] without a revelation right amen you said
[10:36] well I I got saved and well you heard
[10:38] somebody speak didn't you did God speak
[10:41] to your heart
[10:45] right well then it's not a great big
[10:48] mystery of the Seven Seals has got to be
[10:51] understood before you get the new birth
[10:53] and you got to know all about the vows
[10:55] and the plagues and the trumpets and all
[10:57] of the things no
[11:00] right it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[11:03] amen personally to you right and you
[11:06] know what Martin Luther receiv received
[11:08] the josu shall live by faith and that
[11:10] was a revelation of Jesus Christ
[11:13] personally to him and he went forth and
[11:16] conquered a world of
[11:19] unbelief with that simple message that J
[11:22] shall live by
[11:24] faith so then when I'm talking about
[11:27] something like that saying that it's
[11:29] something that he's got to reveal
[11:31] himself to
[11:32] you I'm not talking about that you had
[11:35] to be in this message to receive the new
[11:37] birth I believe right over there across
[11:40] the street at that little
[11:42] non-denominational church I believe God
[11:45] could come down tonight and save
[11:47] somebody's Soul now that's contrary to
[11:50] most people but still remember now it
[11:54] still got to be that the word got to be
[11:56] planted amen but what's the planning of
[11:58] the word it's not the seals of plagues
[12:00] of vs of trun it's telling you about
[12:03] Jesus Christ and his love for
[12:06] you and how he died for you
[12:10] right that's how simple it can be but no
[12:14] matter what it's a revelation of Jesus
[12:17] Christ right cuz remember how we were
[12:19] trying to bring out and Jesus Christ is
[12:21] the word amen so it's the word revealed
[12:25] so there's never been a person saved
[12:27] that didn't hear the word of God first
[12:29] that's right amen it's impossible
[12:32] because you heard it from somebody you
[12:33] read the Bible you you know you heard a
[12:35] tape you heard somebody speaking to you
[12:37] Grandma talking to you you know Daddy
[12:40] talk Mama talking to you or something it
[12:43] had to be that Faith cometh by hearing
[12:45] amen and hearing then comes by the word
[12:48] of God all right right see because
[12:52] you'll see then like I'm saying that
[12:54] when you come to that point then that
[12:56] our breathing across those vocal
[12:59] cords creates words amen all right and
[13:04] brings it to forth to until the ear can
[13:08] hear what is being said all right but
[13:12] see it takes a revelation
[13:16] then this is not just coming to church
[13:19] and and just being good we we've tried
[13:22] to go through those things to try to
[13:24] help to show that you can be ever bit of
[13:27] that and still be lost
[13:31] well I didn't know it was a revelation
[13:33] well well what now you do so okay we'll
[13:36] leave it that way you do now so you're
[13:39] responsible for it but have you ever
[13:41] prayed for a
[13:43] revelation have you ever asked God to
[13:45] reveal himself to
[13:48] you it can be a simple
[13:51] thing that he could wake you up in the
[13:53] middle of the night and speak to
[13:55] you and you accept that could bring
[13:59] eternal life
[14:01] amen we see we want to get on to all of
[14:03] the others like well you know like I
[14:06] said I emphasized it a lot you
[14:10] say what about the New Birth what you
[14:12] well I spoke in tongues I shouted I
[14:14] cried that's not what I'm talking about
[14:18] no right
[14:19] amen the disciples had spent three and a
[14:22] half
[14:23] years with all kind of signs and wonders
[14:27] taking place at their own hands let
[14:30] alone being witnesses to the things of
[14:32] the Lord Jesus
[14:34] am and that didn't save one of them
[14:40] right right right see then you say but
[14:44] yet you're doing away with everything
[14:46] I've got well if I can do away with
[14:47] everything you got then you ain't got
[14:50] nothing is that a good way of saying it
[14:52] might be bad language but it's truth
[14:55] amen that's
[14:57] right
[15:00] but do you can you
[15:01] say God has revealed himself to
[15:07] me and see then you'll never have to
[15:09] worry about it amen cuz they can't
[15:12] deprogram you they can't take it away
[15:14] from you if he's revealed it to you now
[15:18] if it ain't revealed to you you don't
[15:20] have to worry about nobody taking it
[15:21] away from you cuz you lost it anyway
[15:26] intellect head knowledge is wonderful
[15:29] we must have it right before we can have
[15:32] the new
[15:34] birth all right right but head knowledge
[15:38] is not that birth that's right amen it's
[15:41] not how much you can read or understand
[15:43] or quote or whatever is what's been
[15:46] revealed to
[15:50] you Satan can't fight a
[15:54] revelation but you can only be saved by
[15:57] revelation well I mean if if that tires
[16:00] up your doctrines and ideas I want you
[16:03] to show me where the Prophet taught
[16:05] something different or the Bible does it
[16:09] cuz remember Sunday what we were trying
[16:10] to bring
[16:11] out every person that has ever been born
[16:16] again is born again the same
[16:21] way right
[16:23] amen all natural normal babies are
[16:27] birthed the same way water blood and
[16:30] spirit and life you know all new births
[16:34] are the same yeah but but but I I I just
[16:37] can't see that because looking back down
[16:39] there and seeing them other people
[16:41] looking at
[16:43] what they each one had a revelation of
[16:46] Jesus Christ for their age and their
[16:48] time that's
[16:51] right a
[16:56] revelation something God has revealed to
[17:01] you personally to
[17:04] you well Amen brother Dale you've just
[17:07] blowed everything I had because I based
[17:10] it on this that or the
[17:12] other
[17:14] well where can you put what you're
[17:16] talking about in the
[17:18] word I see it right if you can put what
[17:22] you're talking about in the word If It's
[17:23] Shouting speaking in tongue crying I've
[17:26] preached that hard and hard hard and
[17:27] hard hard trying to get you to see it I
[17:30] believe in every bit of that I believe
[17:31] in the manifestation of the spirit of
[17:33] God I believe in many many things that
[17:35] God does I believe that when children
[17:38] are born they will be children and act
[17:41] like children and cry I believe that
[17:44] amen I just don't
[17:46] believe that those are the things then
[17:49] we found out what was the evidence of
[17:51] the Holy
[17:53] Ghost right well you go out to the world
[17:56] and ask them what's the evidence of the
[17:58] Holy Ghost
[17:59] I cried I spoke in tongu I
[18:03] shout when the prophet of God says that
[18:06] the evidence was the same in every age
[18:10] that's right
[18:14] amen because the birth was the
[18:17] sign right what is the evidence to do
[18:21] then it's whether or not the spirit and
[18:23] you can agree with the word continually
[18:26] agrees with the word now you'll agree
[18:28] with a certain part yeah but I mean
[18:31] keeps on agreeing right all right even
[18:34] the prophet himself thinking that it was
[18:36] love you remember we gave it Sunday off
[18:38] a broken sister where he said that the
[18:41] Lord come down in a vision and
[18:43] straightened him
[18:44] out and said it has to do with receiving
[18:48] the
[18:50] word we see that way then everybody's
[18:52] got the same
[18:56] evidence everybody's got the same birth
[18:59] birth now there's stages of developments
[19:02] and things in the birth yes because
[19:05] we'll get to that after a while going
[19:06] through but the new birth is the new
[19:09] birth it's the birth of the word it's
[19:12] the word you heard amen quickened un you
[19:17] amen Made Alive where you can can say I
[19:23] see a personal
[19:27] revelation
[19:29] always has a positive
[19:33] attitude all
[19:36] right now you see
[19:39] job he said I know that's right all
[19:43] right now I wrote it in my Bible right
[19:45] in there 19 and 23 right there I wrote
[19:49] it in my Bible years ago like
[19:54] this job had a
[19:57] revelation
[19:59] he said I know my redeemer liveth all
[20:02] right now he not maybe not seeing what
[20:06] we would think he would see as going
[20:09] down to Calvary or whatever uh that's
[20:12] all right if he saw every bit of it to
[20:13] the detail but it's all right if he
[20:17] didn't because the vision was to him
[20:21] that he saw a
[20:22] vision that's right all
[20:25] right his three Buddies were probably
[20:29] good
[20:30] guys right probably real good people you
[20:34] know they were doing their best to
[20:36] convince job you must have goofed up
[20:38] somewhere and job said I didn't do it I
[20:41] didn't do it and they kept on they loved
[20:44] him they wanted to help
[20:46] him but you know what was the difference
[20:49] job had a
[20:51] vision they had a head knowledge right
[20:54] right their head knowledge would agree
[20:59] to an end of the world because even
[21:02] irregardless of the Pharisees and the
[21:04] Sadducees they say the sagues don't
[21:06] believe in the resurrection well now I I
[21:09] differ with you on that point I believe
[21:11] that they believe in a final
[21:14] Resurrection whereas the Pharisees was
[21:16] believing in a resurrection up you know
[21:19] coming true but those you don't do you
[21:22] think those Sadducees well ain't no
[21:25] Resurrection you're dead you're dead
[21:27] well why you going to believe in God for
[21:31] right come on they were Believers of God
[21:33] they were fighting for the word of
[21:36] God they just didn't believe in a right
[21:38] then
[21:40] Resurrection see because job said I know
[21:43] my redeemer liveth and when in the last
[21:48] days he'll stand upon the Earth amen and
[21:52] I'll see him paraphrasing in our
[21:54] language right I'll see him for myself
[21:58] that's right amen amen see he was
[22:01] standing looking at that what do you
[22:04] think the other guys were
[22:06] doing well that's right job we we
[22:08] believe yeah we believe it we believe
[22:11] that there we believe there'll be a but
[22:14] we just don't put it all in what you're
[22:19] saying so what did they wind up with
[22:23] hope that's
[22:26] right now what do we how tonight do we
[22:28] have hope or faith that's right that's
[22:31] right now job said I know brother BR
[22:34] said he had a positive attitude so I
[22:36] ain't worried about that cuz I I believe
[22:39] he did that word I know there is not
[22:42] just I think or I
[22:43] hope he said I know my redeemer liveth
[22:47] all
[22:48] right now but to others what about a
[22:53] hope now there is hope in the Bible
[22:55] terminologies that is the same word is
[22:58] Faith right but there's hope in the
[23:01] Bible terminologies of words that is
[23:03] just a mental conception now which one
[23:07] you
[23:09] got what have you got what what's your
[23:12] thoughts brother Joe gave me this he
[23:14] didn't know I was going to speak on this
[23:15] but he just looked at the notes and said
[23:17] positive attitude so he he just ran me
[23:19] off one if they can pull this one up and
[23:22] just go ahead and pull up uh Faith
[23:24] cometh by hearing brother around
[23:26] preached in 1954 4 uh 3:20 we go down to
[23:30] e26 well
[23:34] look then in the 10th
[23:37] chapter say we find him trying trying
[23:40] him now dividing what faith is now Faith
[23:43] is Burly my hope I like to think of
[23:46] faith hope faith and hope faith and
[23:48] charity all right now and
[23:54] look and hope what a beautiful thing
[23:58] hope
[23:59] is little
[24:01] timid lovely and sweet as she is yet
[24:05] she's the greatest enemy faith
[24:09] has yes
[24:11] sir now he's not talking about the hope
[24:15] that is an anchor of the
[24:17] Soul right cu the hope that is an anchor
[24:21] of the soul is Faith that's it but it's
[24:24] just hope do we have an anchor of the
[24:27] Soul we just have a hope look what he
[24:30] says she's the greatest enemy faith has
[24:35] y that's right the greatest enemy fa God
[24:38] is Hope because a person becomes so
[24:42] hopeful till they leave away from
[24:48] Faith that's getting pretty strong is't
[24:50] it that requires you think a little bit
[24:53] doesn't it all
[24:56] right watch now hope will agree with the
[25:01] Bible hope will say it's true hope will
[25:05] say I believe every bit of it I believe
[25:09] that that's the word of
[25:12] God and I believe that God will keep his
[25:15] promise hope believes all of
[25:19] that but hope then says now I believe
[25:23] that God will heal right but look at my
[25:27] condition
[25:30] y so do we have hope or a hope that's an
[25:34] anchor of the Soul which is
[25:36] Faith see because you got hope faith and
[25:39] charity if you don't put them
[25:44] together you're going to run
[25:47] out think of
[25:50] that do you understand the difference
[25:53] right amen there is a hope that is an
[25:55] anchor of the Soul which is fine to
[25:57] believe in his faith and you don't have
[25:58] to worry about it right
[26:01] right but then there's a hope that's
[26:04] just yeah I hope that's right I believe
[26:06] it I believe God's word now doesn't now
[26:09] will you agree with me most of us fit in
[26:12] that last part of that
[26:15] category
[26:16] right what about it no I've got
[26:21] faith well like brother R said
[26:24] now he said what are you doing in the
[26:27] pray L that's right if you got faith
[26:32] that's right Y what are you doing coming
[26:36] back to the prayer line right over and
[26:39] over if you got faith amen
[26:44] y but see we think of
[26:50] Hope see we get it all
[26:54] confused we can have what you would call
[26:57] A human positive
[26:59] attitude best way I could say it because
[27:01] it's not Holy Ghost attitude if it's
[27:04] hope that's a holy ghost it will be the
[27:05] anchor of the Soul it will be Faith
[27:07] which is a revealed word of
[27:10] God but what about a positive
[27:13] attitude see a lot of times we think
[27:16] it's pretty positive don't
[27:18] we we believe God's word we believe what
[27:21] he
[27:23] says well why doesn't it
[27:26] produce now we start you know what we
[27:29] start doing we start propping it
[27:33] up
[27:35] right one of our great proper
[27:41] uppers
[27:43] right is to say well the Lord just
[27:46] trying my
[27:49] faith to see if I'll hold
[27:52] on now I didn't know he had to try it to
[27:55] see whether he we would hold on on or
[27:58] not I thought he knew whether we would
[28:01] hold on or not I I kind of had that in
[28:04] my idea is that the way you think he
[28:07] don't have to worry about it amen that's
[28:10] right but you see we can have a hope and
[28:13] it not be and it could be a great
[28:14] wonderful thing but it's not a positive
[28:21] attitude do we have a positive attitude
[28:25] about God's word that's
[28:28] right at least we ought to say one thing
[28:31] this is at least my way of saying it I
[28:33] believe the word's right right whether
[28:36] or not I
[28:38] can produce it or what it can happen I
[28:41] still believe it's
[28:44] right I believe what God Said is
[28:47] true and Lord help me doubt my doubts
[28:51] you know to get me to the place all
[28:54] right so then what is the new birth
[28:59] it's a personal revelation to
[29:03] you that's not just a hope
[29:07] right it's a
[29:09] revelation CU there's a lot of
[29:11] difference in a revelation and a hope
[29:13] now maybe I quote it over again from him
[29:16] we can use that word hope and say I
[29:18] believe the word of God I believe the
[29:20] Bible to be true I believe God's A
[29:23] Healer but my case is different
[29:28] now
[29:29] that's pretty shallow isn't it may I
[29:32] quote the prophet that's about as
[29:34] shallow as a soup made off a shadow of a
[29:36] chicken and starve to death you think
[29:38] I'm rough in what I say you ought to
[29:40] listen to him a
[29:43] lot but do you understand what I'm
[29:45] getting
[29:47] at if we have a personal
[29:51] revelation then that personal
[29:54] revelation gives us a positive at
[29:57] attitude that's right
[30:02] amen why do you think I preach the way I
[30:04] do but have not afraid to put it on the
[30:06] internet
[30:09] worldwide if I had a hope I sure
[30:11] wouldn't be putting it on the
[30:13] internet cuz somebody going to tackle
[30:21] you but see if I've got a
[30:24] faith then I don't worry about it
[30:27] amen because it's anchored
[30:30] amen all
[30:33] right hope can bring me to a
[30:37] faith but hope is not Faith
[30:42] right right see if that's all you got
[30:45] hold on to it don't lose
[30:47] it I've never tried to dechristianize
[30:50] anybody to tell anybody say well well
[30:52] you're lost no you're going to determine
[30:55] yourself whether you're lost or not not
[30:57] me cuz I'm not going to get into that
[30:59] cuz I don't have no business in that
[31:01] that's not far me that's between you and
[31:04] God it's when you and the Lord to decide
[31:07] whether or not you're right amen all
[31:09] right and see that way then it's not a
[31:12] head
[31:14] knowledge a revelation is not a head
[31:17] knowledge no that's
[31:20] right
[31:22] right you can only know God I gave you
[31:25] the or this par phrased a little bit of
[31:28] it
[31:30] Sunday and didn't read
[31:37] them
[31:39] look the only way you can know God is by
[31:46] faith yes
[31:48] sir the only way you can know God is by
[31:52] faith to know
[31:56] him is
[31:58] life not to know about the word nor the
[32:01] letter of the
[32:03] word but to know him is life so you can
[32:06] only know him by the word for he is the
[32:13] word it's the only way you can know him
[32:17] right see as the natural we trying to
[32:20] bring out Sunday as the natural baby
[32:22] requires first the the planting of the
[32:26] seed so does the spiritual birth require
[32:29] that right and you can't be born
[32:35] again without having faith am and you
[32:38] can't understand god without the new
[32:41] birth right right you've got to be born
[32:45] again or you'll never understand God
[32:48] that's taken from the message
[32:53] expectation but do we have a
[32:56] revelation
[33:02] have we had as trying to get out a
[33:04] personal
[33:06] experience with Jesus Christ
[33:09] right or is it just Mom and Daddy's in
[33:12] church I'm in church Mom and Daddy
[33:15] wouldn't be here I probably wouldn't be
[33:16] here either is that the way we
[33:20] are are we living off with somebody else
[33:23] experience that's right think about that
[33:28] are we living off of brother bram's
[33:32] experience I used to have a brother in
[33:35] this message he's passed on now but I
[33:37] mean he talked to me once a week or
[33:39] twice about doctrines of the message and
[33:41] and we Fellowship together like
[33:44] everything and I preached a simple
[33:46] message one day about something and I
[33:49] said this is my
[33:52] Revelation I had an open pull pit to
[33:55] preach there anytime I desired
[33:58] I just had to all I had to do is walk
[34:03] in he sent word by another brother to
[34:06] tell brother Dale that he wasn't going
[34:09] to preach in his church no
[34:11] more because this was his
[34:15] words I got a revelation that brother
[34:18] brandham is the only ones that got a
[34:25] revelation you a statement right I said
[34:29] I had a revelation about what brother R
[34:32] said he said he had a revelation that he
[34:35] didn't have a revelation well those
[34:38] words are the same to me I said I had a
[34:40] revelation he said he had a
[34:43] revelation but his Revelation was only
[34:45] what brother Brown said well I hope
[34:47] that's all mine's ever been based on at
[34:49] least I
[34:50] try because I believe the word of God
[34:53] Amen but see you don't know God by
[34:55] education but God's known by faith amen
[35:00] and the only way you can know
[35:04] him is by
[35:06] Faith by Revelation amen see that's what
[35:09] we think about
[35:12] faith we talk about faith and what is
[35:17] Faith Prophet said it's
[35:20] Revelation right all right now we think
[35:23] listen we think it's believing
[35:27] God's
[35:28] word now
[35:31] listen we think faith is believing God's
[35:35] word well what if God's word has been
[35:38] incorrectly taught to
[35:40] you
[35:44] right now you tell me it's faith if the
[35:48] word is incorrectly
[35:51] taught
[35:53] right so you get in trouble when you're
[35:56] facing it
[35:58] correctly but see faith is a
[36:01] revelation and I thought the Bible
[36:04] said the Lord Jesus Christ said it Upon
[36:07] This Rock This Revelation I'll build my
[36:11] church amen right I thought it was the
[36:15] whole church was based on the revelation
[36:16] of Jesus
[36:17] Christ
[36:21] right that's what I thought I thought as
[36:24] I read this Bible and do as a Prophet
[36:27] said if I don't see Christ in every
[36:28] verse I need to read it again cuz I've
[36:31] missed
[36:33] something but we look in there to try to
[36:35] find ourselves or find somebody else to
[36:39] read and we can take this one to put it
[36:42] over here and what is it let's see uh
[36:46] John
[36:49] 666 boy that's that's a great Revelation
[36:52] and that's really something that's a
[36:53] great Revelation about the
[36:55] Antichrist
[36:57] well I didn't know the Antichrist could
[36:58] be
[37:01] revealed I thought it was Jesus Christ
[37:03] being revealed and you've seen the
[37:05] Antichrist and going in an opposite
[37:06] direction I thought that was the secret
[37:09] of the message in the last days that you
[37:11] cannot reveal the
[37:13] Antichrist you reveal Jesus Christ and
[37:15] you see the Antichrist in
[37:19] opposition but you see that's where we
[37:21] put it instead of having it then no
[37:23] wonder we don't have a positive attitude
[37:30] because we're up and down with
[37:33] it job said I know brother R said that
[37:36] was a positive attitude right
[37:42] amen a positive
[37:46] attitude had been revealed to
[37:48] him Abel knew that he was born in his
[37:52] mother's blood from his father's blood
[37:54] that was a revelation unto him and that
[37:56] was called Abel's
[37:58] Faith Abraham believed
[38:03] God right am and that was his
[38:07] faith that he believed
[38:15] in what about your faith could it be put
[38:17] to a test what about what you
[38:22] believe we need somebody to come along
[38:24] and really jog it to see whether not we
[38:27] whether it's Faith or whether we just
[38:28] have hope or a thought right of course
[38:32] we've always got now we've always got a
[38:37] cop
[38:39] out right brother brandham says for me
[38:43] to not talk Doctrine but to take it to
[38:47] my
[38:48] pastor or my
[38:52] husband and probably 90% of the women in
[38:54] this message wouldn't wouldn't even try
[38:57] to take it back to their husband cuz
[38:59] they they probably know more than he
[39:05] does how would you like it to somebody
[39:08] talking to you and you say well I'll let
[39:10] my husband talk to
[39:13] you that's good that's wonderful that's
[39:15] a
[39:19] quote but you know where the Prophet
[39:21] said that it wound up with a problem you
[39:23] mean to tell me you can't witness
[39:25] sisters
[39:28] and you know witnessing you're going to
[39:30] have to say some
[39:33] things
[39:36] right if you're witnessing to somebody
[39:38] you're going to have to say some
[39:41] things you know you're going to have to
[39:43] say hey we believe in one true and
[39:45] living
[39:48] God well then there's where the Trouble
[39:50] Comes see the preacher or somebody says
[39:52] to you we say explain it so I can't
[39:55] maybe explain it to you and that's to
[39:56] what I believe but I believe in one true
[39:58] and living
[40:00] God and I'll give you the best simple
[40:02] illustration I can give you but then
[40:04] we'll stop it that what's wrong with
[40:08] that I thought you used to have a
[40:12] witness I thought that Aquilla Priscilla
[40:15] one of them was or
[40:20] right and they were convincing other
[40:25] people right
[40:29] but do you understand what I'm talking
[40:30] about do you actually have a positive
[40:34] attitude to where that you're not
[40:36] worried about what
[40:38] somebody has to
[40:44] say are you concerned that you could
[40:47] be
[40:50] wrong well if you are you probably need
[40:52] to check it you might find out if you
[40:55] are God if you think it wrong why would
[40:57] you be thinking that
[41:01] right well this is the way I see it well
[41:04] that could be good now but remember it's
[41:07] something
[41:09] personal you don't hear me arguing with
[41:12] people and say this is the way I see it
[41:15] I said let's get down into the word of
[41:17] God and see what the word of God has to
[41:19] say about
[41:22] this
[41:24] right why because I don't mind my faith
[41:27] being put to the test it's really good
[41:29] for you amen it's good for you to be put
[41:33] to the test it's good to find out what
[41:34] you believe you
[41:37] know right you might find out you
[41:39] believe more than what you
[41:40] think you know but what about
[41:45] it what about a positive
[41:52] attitude now these are a couple of
[41:55] thoughts and I know I think ain't
[41:57] crazy but brother brandom on God's
[41:59] chosen place of worship says you cannot
[42:03] be a
[42:04] negative without a positive now Aaron
[42:08] back is an electrician he'd probably
[42:10] show me the theories of things but I
[42:12] ain't interested in electrical
[42:15] theories I'm interested in the word of
[42:18] God you there cannot be a
[42:22] negative without a positive which one
[42:26] comes
[42:29] first now he knows electrically
[42:33] speaking that the negative is
[42:36] there what we need is the
[42:39] positive I mean you you don't have to
[42:41] create
[42:43] negativity right right it's just
[42:46] there all
[42:49] right and see then what you do is you
[42:52] take and I I've not done but I've done a
[42:54] little bit of wiring but you you can
[42:56] just you can take an electrical wire
[42:58] with 10,000 currents on it and as long
[43:02] as you're not grounded you can hold that
[43:06] wire now I may be wrong in my theory of
[43:09] whatever is what these is called is and
[43:12] that's called that but it just plain
[43:16] sense if there's not something to make
[43:19] that grounded it won't kill
[43:21] you won't hurt you at
[43:23] all why the prophet said this room is
[43:26] full of electricity right
[43:30] y really what did they do Aaron they
[43:33] were really wound up of a way to find
[43:34] out how to make it NE to to ground it
[43:38] but the positive was
[43:43] first now God has always been
[43:48] positive all right now I know brother
[43:51] brandom and what he says about it and I
[43:52] agree with what the way he uses it cuz
[43:54] he'll say from negative to positive and
[43:57] a lot of people argue that in the
[43:58] message and say you can't have
[44:00] that well I differ with you brother R
[44:03] said you can go from negative to
[44:06] positive I believe that because we start
[44:09] off as we're totally
[44:13] negative every individual every person
[44:17] is totally
[44:19] negative all right it takes the word of
[44:22] God to to make a point there for
[44:25] something be anchored too that's what
[44:27] I've been talking about the New
[44:29] Birth the word planted within you is
[44:33] wonderful but if the Holy Spirit doesn't
[44:36] come to Quicken that there is no new
[44:38] birth that's right amen I don't care how
[44:40] much words you got there's no New Birth
[44:43] without that being quickened by the Holy
[44:45] Ghost all right but you see the negative
[44:49] didn't come first the positive came
[44:52] first cuz the positive was almighty God
[44:55] right
[44:56] all right now if you take it in that
[45:00] order of thinking about it
[45:04] see then the prophet says it on my
[45:07] kinsman redeemer there's no more
[45:13] negative it's all positive
[45:16] amen see now when we realize that we're
[45:19] not worried about you know cuz you ain't
[45:21] talking about electric lights whether
[45:22] they work or not you're talking about
[45:24] faith that will take us out of this
[45:25] world
[45:27] so I don't want nothing
[45:30] negative all right I told you now I know
[45:32] where brother Rand said it I can quote
[45:34] okay I know where he use it he'll say
[45:36] from negative to positive because they
[45:38] argued that way back 20 40 50 years ago
[45:42] that they didn't agree with that I
[45:43] Agreed 100% with it because he wasn't
[45:45] saying negative to positive he was
[45:47] saying partial to perfect
[45:51] right because you can take it from
[45:53] partial to perfect you know that
[45:55] everything thing starts
[45:59] partial your new birth starts at a
[46:03] partial because you take justification
[46:06] sanctification those are both a
[46:09] partial right so then instead of it
[46:12] being negative to positive it's from
[46:15] partial to
[46:16] perfect that's the best
[46:19] answer all right see then that
[46:23] way energy can I must wrong tell me
[46:29] energy cannot be NE neither created nor
[46:33] destroyed that's right you know
[46:36] that energy cannot be created nor
[46:42] destroyed you only learn how to use it
[46:46] harness it bringing it into the bases of
[46:49] finding where to put the ground wire
[46:51] right right that's right but see in
[46:55] energy cannot be created cuz energy is
[46:58] God you never talked to people about the
[47:00] Big Bang
[47:03] Theory you know I mean they're Big Bang
[47:05] on on the evolution not the big bang of
[47:09] you
[47:10] know see there their idea of it is that
[47:15] somewhere this thing got started because
[47:18] of something that was
[47:21] real and that's why I don't understand
[47:23] when you're talking to somebody that
[47:25] says oh we just come down from this and
[47:27] we come from that we'll just ask them to
[47:29] go on backwards if they're going to say
[47:31] anything is real then you're going to
[47:33] have to say there's a
[47:36] God if you're going to say energy is
[47:39] real then you got to agree that there's
[47:41] a
[47:43] God but listen this is my point
[47:47] now everything goes
[47:51] from partial
[47:53] realization to perfect realiz Iz
[47:57] ation but now remember as I'm trying to
[47:59] get to point for the message tonight of
[48:01] a positive attitude remember one
[48:04] thing the most negative part of the word
[48:07] of God may I say it that way is the most
[48:11] positive thing that could ever be the
[48:14] most negative part you could think about
[48:16] God's
[48:17] word is the most positive thing that
[48:20] could ever be cuz you're dealing with
[48:22] his word amen amen amen you ain't
[48:25] dealing with thoughts and ideas and
[48:27] knowledge and how to do this and how to
[48:29] do that you're dealing with whether or
[48:31] not it's been revealed to
[48:33] you so the smallest Revelation that's
[48:38] it now use that word because I what I
[48:42] don't how the education express it good
[48:43] enough but the smallest Revelation you
[48:46] could think of that ever been revealed
[48:47] to you you know that that's more
[48:49] positive and all the things the devil's
[48:51] got in his
[48:54] AR
[48:56] everything the devil's got on his side
[48:58] of the story is put out by a little
[49:01] Revelation a room can be so dark until
[49:05] as the old saying goes you you stick
[49:07] your finger out pull it back find a hole
[49:10] it's so dark that you can't see nothing
[49:12] but you strike one
[49:15] match
[49:16] amen
[49:19] right it puts out every bit of that
[49:21] Darkness
[49:24] amen that's what a revelation
[49:31] is what's the problem when God reveals
[49:34] it to
[49:39] you when he reveals it to you it may be
[49:42] the most negative thought that could
[49:45] ever
[49:47] be but it would be in God the most
[49:50] positive thing above everything in the
[49:54] world because it's a positive
[49:59] attitude and we got to get away from the
[50:01] negative
[50:03] see get away from the negative
[50:08] amen that's why I believe like I do and
[50:11] I've always tried to teach it to you and
[50:12] you say well how is this and how is that
[50:15] you know right today that in the body of
[50:17] Christ there are people that are that
[50:19] are at each one of these levels of the
[50:22] stature of a perfect man that's right is
[50:26] that true but does this one up here say
[50:30] I don't need you down
[50:34] there no you're based upon that
[50:39] Faith that's why I've always try to
[50:42] defend it even great people and say well
[50:44] they can't preach era the man
[50:47] said zeusa Street Pentecost was
[50:51] false now you tell me Theus Street
[50:53] Pentecost was false I'm going to tell
[50:55] you your f fault
[50:56] amen because that was the move of God
[50:59] for the
[51:00] hour
[51:03] amen
[51:05] well see that was the most that was a
[51:09] partial
[51:10] realization we
[51:12] agree Martin Luther in his message of
[51:15] the just shall live by faith sure in
[51:18] comparison to the day and the hour that
[51:20] we're living and the word has been
[51:22] brought to our understanding it was a
[51:25] partial
[51:29] realization going to a
[51:32] perfect you ever noticed this with the
[51:34] prophet he said your soul is not
[51:41] complete now how many knows what the
[51:43] rest of the statement
[51:48] is he say you only have the earnest of
[51:51] your
[51:53] inheritance that's what the Bible says
[51:55] that's
[51:57] right the most negative thought we could
[52:00] think of in
[52:02] God would be the most positive thing
[52:05] compared to the world Amen then could
[52:08] be so when you receive the new birth you
[52:11] get the earnest of your
[52:15] inheritance that's what the Bible says
[52:18] hey that's why you know what I say a lot
[52:22] of things you know but do you think
[52:24] about it then it don't matter how old
[52:27] you are and how much knowledge you got
[52:30] the day you receive the new birth you a
[52:36] baby that desires the sincere milk of
[52:39] the word that you may grow thereby a
[52:45] baby why the Bible says
[52:47] what don't put a novice in
[52:53] charge right brother around said is
[52:55] there in The Honky Tonk praying playing
[52:57] music and singing to serve the devil he
[53:00] said next night they're preaching in the
[53:01] pull
[53:04] pit well who are you you going to tell
[53:08] that person that they're
[53:09] not supposed to be preaching I'm going
[53:12] to tell them say what you need to do is
[53:14] you need to get a bottle and a pacifier
[53:16] and go sit
[53:19] down cuz you going to preach the same
[53:21] old devil you were singing to the night
[53:23] before cuz you don't know nothing about
[53:25] God cuz it don't come in one
[53:30] whack you say would you tell somebody
[53:33] that sure I sure would remember I'm the
[53:37] guy that you say would you cast a stone
[53:40] at somebody that does wrong hey I got to
[53:42] pick up the Rock and throw it I'm the
[53:45] pastor I don't want to but I got to tell
[53:48] it like it is you don't put a novice in
[53:51] the pull pit right we've done it a many
[53:54] of times in what has it done to a lot of
[53:56] people that's right blowed their head so
[54:00] big right that's right what did I tell
[54:04] Wade when he come and told me that he
[54:06] believe the Lord called him to preach I
[54:07] said run run run run run that's right I
[54:11] said you run until he runs you down son
[54:13] and I'm talking to a guy that at 12
[54:16] years old could quote most of the
[54:19] preachers to death in this message and I
[54:22] will not back off one word
[54:26] because I've been there and
[54:28] seen a man had had the knowledge of this
[54:31] message they would come to me and he
[54:33] said Daddy why do I think
[54:35] this I said because it's the truth
[54:41] son he said well where did I get it I
[54:43] said all of that knowledge you've had
[54:44] over all of these years that you studied
[54:46] the message back in those
[54:49] years but see my point to him run
[54:53] run sit down
[54:59] listen
[55:01] listen amen get it anchored within
[55:05] you to where then it's not just you
[55:08] saying well brother random said this or
[55:10] daddy said
[55:12] this it's whether or not you have a
[55:15] revelation
[55:17] amen you you can't put it on that right
[55:20] am see see in this
[55:23] day we are to come to perfect
[55:28] realization all right that's right you
[55:31] say well what's going to cause the
[55:32] Rapture to come brother Dale and the
[55:34] things what do you look at to say uh the
[55:37] only thing I can say is what the prophet
[55:38] says when it comes to perfect
[55:40] realization that's
[55:42] right right right well see then that
[55:45] would require that the word opened from
[55:48] partial to
[55:50] perfect if you want to use the word
[55:52] negative to positive as long as you're
[55:54] talking like that you're all right amen
[55:57] right but just remember there's nothing
[55:59] negative in God the most negative part
[56:01] of God is is more positive than all the
[56:04] things the devil's got amen right that's
[56:07] right what is the new birth it's the
[56:10] birth of the word that's right but you
[56:14] know
[56:14] what we spend a lot of times talking and
[56:18] people do a lot of things and leave out
[56:20] a
[56:22] lot but you know what
[56:28] my wife will agree with you on this my
[56:31] belly is still getting
[56:35] bigger so I must be
[56:39] growing right and you know how I'm
[56:45] growing by
[56:47] eating right
[56:50] right by eating right so it's evidently
[56:55] that the natural person never stops I
[56:58] told Brother Lor one time I hope you
[57:01] don't mind if he hears this he's always
[57:03] laughed at it but I've seen him on dots
[57:05] and he go up and down and up and down I
[57:07] said brother Lor in the time I've known
[57:10] you you've gained and lost over a th000
[57:14] pound and that's true yeah
[57:19] right but if the natural is true how do
[57:22] you grow in the
[57:23] spiritual
[57:28] right you take a baby and you get it
[57:30] started and then you just stop it and
[57:32] don't give it no more milk what does it
[57:34] do it'll
[57:36] die but you let it grow until one day
[57:39] comes that it doesn't need milk as much
[57:41] it still uses
[57:43] that but you can start feeding it a
[57:46] little
[57:49] food you take a c these teren and what
[57:52] Zachs learned a lot about that you take
[57:55] a baby CF and and you you take it off
[57:58] the mama if you lose it or something and
[58:01] and you give it milk but you think well
[58:03] boy next week I inan tomorrow I'll just
[58:05] I'll just throw him a bunch of hay out
[58:08] there well first off probably wouldn't
[58:11] eat very much but second all it's got
[58:13] about four different
[58:15] stomachs and that first stomach takes 21
[58:18] days I think they say for it to develop
[58:19] into a stage to where other things could
[58:22] be
[58:23] at
[58:25] well you know God's good at
[58:28] that you know he don't require all of us
[58:31] to be the same
[58:34] level because he knows we're
[58:37] not he deals with us according to our
[58:40] abilities all right thinking about it
[58:44] perfect partial realization comparing to
[58:47] perfect realization and bringing it to a
[58:51] positive
[58:53] attitude
[58:56] now I know this thought doesn't maybe
[58:59] ring with you but you know I've said it
[59:02] so it's not the first time of saying
[59:04] it you know I've always said that the
[59:07] way I check a Doctrine from anybody is
[59:10] how by my new
[59:16] birth I I check them by the prophet I
[59:19] check them by the Bible Well I you know
[59:22] I I think that's what I meaning but
[59:25] that's all right you go
[59:28] ahead that's just like the old
[59:30] Pentecostal they shake each other's hand
[59:32] look in the eye you know I'm Discerning
[59:33] your
[59:35] spirit well you know what it was two
[59:37] Devils looking at each other
[59:43] probably but you see I remember how I
[59:48] was born again
[59:51] right and you know somebody starts
[59:54] talking about being born again they'll
[59:56] say you know well not born again come
[1:00:00] forth speaking in tongues well that's
[1:00:02] all
[1:00:03] right if they've got that in the right
[1:00:06] order that's
[1:00:07] right but if they're saying their birth
[1:00:10] is them coming forth speaking in
[1:00:14] tongues see now you're making it the
[1:00:16] evidence of the Holy Ghost and you're
[1:00:17] off the word right
[1:00:20] amen well what about it what do you
[1:00:22] think about the word of God
[1:00:25] see the word of God I've been studying
[1:00:27] now since back in the Baptist which
[1:00:29] would have been
[1:00:31] about 60
[1:00:36] something roughly
[1:00:41] 60 and you know I still believe the same
[1:00:45] thing and that is that the word of God
[1:00:50] never stops
[1:00:53] growing it never never stops unfolding
[1:00:58] amen it never stops being revealed
[1:01:04] amen you get something down here that's
[1:01:06] revealed to you and then you get
[1:01:08] something over here that's revealed to
[1:01:10] you and it's contrary somewhere you
[1:01:12] missed it one of them's wrong that's
[1:01:14] right probably both of them's wrong but
[1:01:18] at least we know one of them is if it's
[1:01:21] contrary see that's why when I come into
[1:01:23] this message then
[1:01:25] I was asked a question in the Bible
[1:01:27] study one night what I put it
[1:01:30] on of what has kept me and what I put
[1:01:34] that on is one thing my love and my
[1:01:38] desire to know about Jesus
[1:01:44] Christ and knowing that this
[1:01:47] message is the way Christ is going to
[1:01:50] come to
[1:01:52] us or else we didn't need a prophet
[1:01:55] right but if we agree we needed one then
[1:01:58] that's the way it's going to
[1:02:02] come see then it's always been a
[1:02:07] NeverEnding
[1:02:09] Revelation
[1:02:12] am I don't believe Revelation
[1:02:14] ends that's right I believe we're just
[1:02:17] getting enough here to when we get dire
[1:02:21] to be able to comprehend what's going on
[1:02:24] there
[1:02:25] that may be a carnal way of saying it
[1:02:27] but I just believe that we're just
[1:02:28] getting enough of the word of God to
[1:02:31] understand God's word enough to talk to
[1:02:33] him when we get there without all of
[1:02:35] these carnalities that we have I've
[1:02:38] always taught you that
[1:02:41] right see it never stops
[1:02:48] unveiling but you see people nowadays
[1:02:50] that they're just changing every which
[1:02:52] way and they and they went with a
[1:02:53] message for 40 years and then brother
[1:02:56] random now's wrong well if he's wrong
[1:02:58] now he's wrong 40 years
[1:03:00] ago but what was the problem you living
[1:03:03] in a world of
[1:03:05] hope you hoping for something to be
[1:03:07] right you wasn't living in a world of
[1:03:11] Faith you're dealing totally in
[1:03:17] Hope but see Faith can't
[1:03:19] end how can a revelation be
[1:03:23] exhausted
[1:03:27] about partial to
[1:03:30] Perfect come
[1:03:32] on you receive the new birth that is
[1:03:36] perfect but it's not the Perfection
[1:03:39] that's required up here
[1:03:42] right you receive the new birth that's
[1:03:45] partial realization of what this is up
[1:03:48] here right but just remember it can't
[1:03:52] change now you can't have how this down
[1:03:55] here being a revelation of one true and
[1:03:58] living God and like they are in the
[1:04:00] message today would Jesus just the Son
[1:04:03] of
[1:04:11] God now that's not partial to
[1:04:16] perfect that's partial back in pice
[1:04:19] negative how can you do
[1:04:23] that
[1:04:25] can you stand and say that after all of
[1:04:28] these years in the message that it's
[1:04:30] greater and greater every day that I
[1:04:34] live to see him unfold
[1:04:43] himself to see God revealing
[1:04:48] himself to you and I
[1:04:51] amen and you know what he'll reveal to
[1:04:55] you that he was a baby one
[1:04:58] time right is that the scripture that
[1:05:01] pretty well does away with most all them
[1:05:03] doctrines because where they say you
[1:05:05] know Jesus wasn't God to the River
[1:05:06] Jordan according to the Bible it says he
[1:05:08] he was born Lord the Christ so that's
[1:05:11] enough to settle that you shouldn't come
[1:05:12] up with something else some garbage can
[1:05:14] after then to be able to try to turn
[1:05:16] that around we want another garbage we
[1:05:18] have another
[1:05:20] Trinity
[1:05:22] right but think about
[1:05:24] it do you have a positive attitude about
[1:05:28] what you
[1:05:29] believe
[1:05:38] amen you see this is the way that it's
[1:05:41] always been to me the reason I love
[1:05:44] it I hear brother randam say things one
[1:05:47] day and man it just sounds like it just
[1:05:52] it just don't fit
[1:05:57] he said I can conclusively prove that
[1:06:00] you're born again and then baptized into
[1:06:02] the
[1:06:06] body when I heard
[1:06:09] that and I remember the biggest portion
[1:06:12] of people that heard that too about that
[1:06:14] time in the late 60s that they was
[1:06:17] really fighting about those things and
[1:06:20] trying to figure out what he was talking
[1:06:21] about but you know when I get something
[1:06:24] like that I just leave it
[1:06:26] alone I don't quit studying on it or
[1:06:28] anything or thinking on it I just leave
[1:06:30] it alone I don't try to figure it out
[1:06:32] right amen I wait on him to tell me
[1:06:38] right and then one day I'll find it
[1:06:40] where the Prophet says it like this he
[1:06:42] says you're born again by the baptism of
[1:06:44] the Holy Ghost he said but the Holy
[1:06:45] Ghost then baptizes you into the body
[1:06:47] for the gifts right now the quotes right
[1:06:51] what you been fighting over to try to
[1:06:53] figure out for a long time the quote
[1:06:57] right wait on
[1:07:00] him he'll give it to
[1:07:02] you yeah but we don't have time to wait
[1:07:05] why you been around let me quote R mo
[1:07:07] one man said he said something to a man
[1:07:09] one day about Statue of perfect man the
[1:07:12] man said I'd like to listen to them
[1:07:14] brother Mo said good I preached 69 I
[1:07:16] think it was 69 sermons it was something
[1:07:17] like that he said I preached about 69
[1:07:20] sermons on it brother looked at him he
[1:07:21] said I ain't got time to listen the 69
[1:07:24] sermon he said you've been goofing off
[1:07:26] all the rest of the time and ain't got
[1:07:31] it he was pretty fly and he was telling
[1:07:34] the
[1:07:35] truth but see that's what but I ain't
[1:07:37] got time to listen to them
[1:07:39] tapes oh you got to go to
[1:07:46] Walmart oh they have many yard
[1:07:51] sale I ain't never figured that in out
[1:07:53] yet
[1:07:54] I ain't bought a yard
[1:07:56] yet I can't understand languages I went
[1:08:00] to town one day me and my wife did and
[1:08:02] we looked up there and there was this
[1:08:03] big old sign and it was great big sign
[1:08:06] said carport
[1:08:11] sale she looked at me or I looked at her
[1:08:13] one of the two during the conversation
[1:08:15] said they ain't got no
[1:08:18] carport so we went to
[1:08:20] town and we came
[1:08:22] back you know what they done while we
[1:08:25] gone they raced that out and they put
[1:08:27] either Port sale or yard sale or
[1:08:29] something you know somebody probably
[1:08:31] told them said you ain't got no car for
[1:08:33] it to
[1:08:35] sell but listen
[1:08:38] church has this message got dull to you
[1:08:41] that you don't enjoy hearing
[1:08:44] it you don't enjoy reading it and
[1:08:47] studying
[1:08:52] it what about
[1:08:57] I'm studying most of the time in
[1:08:59] something relation to what I preach my
[1:09:01] wife a lot of times I'll tell you and I
[1:09:02] do it too she'll say honey we just heard
[1:09:05] that tape night before
[1:09:07] last I told her I said but there's
[1:09:10] something I'm thinking about well it's
[1:09:13] okay she she said it's all right we need
[1:09:15] to listen to it again and she to her
[1:09:18] she's listening to it she's done heard
[1:09:19] it two nights before but to me I'm
[1:09:21] listening to it and I remember something
[1:09:23] he said over there I want to go back and
[1:09:24] listen to it again you know my point
[1:09:28] you're not preachers you don't have to
[1:09:30] plan what you're going to listen to you
[1:09:32] can just put on the
[1:09:34] tape and you just enjoy listening the
[1:09:36] 40s and the 50s and the
[1:09:39] 60s as preachers as we got to be doing a
[1:09:42] little bit of
[1:09:43] studying but get to point
[1:09:46] now has the message continually open to
[1:09:52] you
[1:09:54] I
[1:09:55] believe that brother brandham was a
[1:09:58] prophet I believe that amen but I
[1:10:01] believe he was a human
[1:10:02] being and I believe the message went
[1:10:05] from partial to perfect realization with
[1:10:08] him over the years that he preached I
[1:10:11] don't believe that he knew everything
[1:10:13] when he came because that would be
[1:10:16] contrary and he'd be telling you a lie
[1:10:17] and you'd be in problem because when he
[1:10:19] gets to the to the seals he said you
[1:10:22] know he didn't see that and when he said
[1:10:23] says on statute of perfect man he said I
[1:10:25] just got this the other day you know
[1:10:28] just quotes
[1:10:31] Okay but listen he said one day he said
[1:10:35] I used to believe that Jesus loved me
[1:10:38] and God hated me he said until I found
[1:10:41] out it the same person that's growth in
[1:10:45] development right you know that the
[1:10:47] Bible even says about Jesus that he
[1:10:51] growed in Grace and knowledge
[1:10:54] amen now that's what the scripture says
[1:10:56] about the Lord
[1:10:57] Jesus all right so we're going to grow
[1:10:59] in Grace and knowledge if not we're
[1:11:01] going to be a stunned birth or you know
[1:11:04] kids that don't grow
[1:11:08] up and I'm going to make this statement
[1:11:10] and just leave it that's why that I
[1:11:14] think that the biggest portion of the
[1:11:16] Ministers of the
[1:11:18] hour they lose their families because
[1:11:21] they don't have any growth development
[1:11:23] to try to help
[1:11:26] them now you can say well you ought not
[1:11:28] say that brother Dale well okay you find
[1:11:31] me some other way to say it and I'll
[1:11:33] back up
[1:11:34] but you got a lot of people in this
[1:11:36] message that their family didn't want
[1:11:38] nothing don't want nothing to do with
[1:11:40] the
[1:11:45] message what if it is that they were not
[1:11:48] presenting the
[1:11:50] message in the right order
[1:11:54] you know yourself that you've you know
[1:11:56] preachers that is preaching the same six
[1:11:59] and seven they was 40 years ago they
[1:12:02] still preaching on women's hiring
[1:12:03] clothes and dresses and right
[1:12:07] amen I believe in preaching it I believe
[1:12:10] in preaching it as an
[1:12:12] experience and then it'll take care of
[1:12:14] the clothes and the hir and the dress
[1:12:15] and the
[1:12:19] thing but see a growth development can
[1:12:22] keep people interested
[1:12:24] right that's right you know you keep
[1:12:27] them
[1:12:28] interested just like I I said now I I'd
[1:12:31] like for you to listen to who is this
[1:12:33] mzed for the weekend well then you ought
[1:12:36] to know that something in there is going
[1:12:38] to be brought
[1:12:41] out and that way you can listen to it
[1:12:43] ahead of time bl's God I listen what I
[1:12:45] want to go
[1:12:47] ahead do what you want to you are
[1:12:52] anyway
[1:12:54] but you see that's just
[1:12:55] me but you see everything I see in the
[1:12:58] Bible goes from a partial realization to
[1:13:01] a perfect
[1:13:02] realization the godhead has to start off
[1:13:06] and to see
[1:13:08] Christ and to see as Wade was bringing
[1:13:10] out the
[1:13:11] logos amen we'll get to that where it's
[1:13:14] the word
[1:13:16] speech I know you won't do it now and I
[1:13:19] won't ask you to so when you get home
[1:13:22] tonight
[1:13:24] turn the back of your hand towards your
[1:13:26] mouth
[1:13:27] and breathe on
[1:13:31] it you feel the wind
[1:13:36] right well don't blow just speak and say
[1:13:48] hallelujah you're going to feel the
[1:13:52] wind what is that song about the wind
[1:13:55] blowing
[1:13:57] blowing you're going to feel the wind
[1:14:00] because you know what we'll get to it
[1:14:02] the Lord willing Sunday the bride is
[1:14:04] born by the Breath of God Amen that's
[1:14:08] right born by the Breath of
[1:14:13] God what about
[1:14:15] it partial to
[1:14:17] perfect I see the godhead going and
[1:14:20] climbing greater and greater but see one
[1:14:23] you see it climbing greater and greater
[1:14:25] that's why in 1969 my first sermon was
[1:14:28] what that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:14:30] would be the son of
[1:14:33] man quoting brother
[1:14:39] brandom it's grow it ever since
[1:14:41] then until it's come to the bases that
[1:14:44] I've quoted it to you and give it to you
[1:14:45] many times where brother R said she will
[1:14:47] be the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:14:50] will be in The Bride of Jesus
[1:14:52] Christ so you know it's not just
[1:14:55] stopping or some one- thought
[1:14:58] sermon that everybody rejoices about one
[1:15:01] little thing or something that's fine
[1:15:03] but what about the growth development in
[1:15:05] our
[1:15:08] souls you know what I pray when I come
[1:15:11] to
[1:15:11] church here or anywhere
[1:15:16] else you know what I
[1:15:18] pray well I'm on my way there I said
[1:15:22] Lord my soul is
[1:15:27] hungry I need a good meal
[1:15:32] Lord feed
[1:15:35] me that's the last thing is said right
[1:15:37] there before the minister enters the P
[1:15:40] pit is Lord feed
[1:15:44] me I'm hungry
[1:15:47] Lord I want to know more about
[1:15:52] you you mean after all that you preached
[1:15:54] in all these years you want to know more
[1:15:56] about God I sure do and I know for a
[1:15:58] certainty there's a whole lot more to
[1:16:01] know
[1:16:06] right what about it partial to
[1:16:10] perfect what about any other thought
[1:16:12] that you could
[1:16:15] take throughout the
[1:16:17] Bible to where you'd see it
[1:16:20] unfold said on Daniel 70 weeks
[1:16:23] he said if you don't understand this you
[1:16:25] won't understand the
[1:16:28] rest he even named the seals and things
[1:16:31] he said you won't understand it but
[1:16:33] nobody wants to know about the Daniel 70
[1:16:37] weeks but they've got their own idea
[1:16:40] they didn't got it figured out see well
[1:16:42] where's the growth
[1:16:44] development where did the seals open
[1:16:46] from
[1:16:51] that you know a lot of people the
[1:16:53] message believe that brother Brandon was
[1:16:54] wrong in his early Ministry but the son
[1:16:57] of man finally come and straightened him
[1:17:01] out and they only want to hear what's
[1:17:03] after the
[1:17:07] seals well if you're going to make once
[1:17:09] before the Seal's partial realization I
[1:17:12] still love to hear those old 47s and 50
[1:17:15] and 60
[1:17:17] and and
[1:17:19] things well because it's a constant
[1:17:22] unveiling to a man that he's telling his
[1:17:29] experience you ever notice this just one
[1:17:32] little Point there's a lot of messages
[1:17:34] called hear ye
[1:17:36] him you know there's some of those
[1:17:38] messages that brother randam never
[1:17:40] mentions
[1:17:43] adoption but yet you ask people about
[1:17:46] adoption here he him there's a lot of
[1:17:48] messages on there that he's just plainly
[1:17:50] saying hear ye him
[1:17:54] hear him he's the
[1:17:59] word partial to
[1:18:07] perfect what
[1:18:09] about justification sanctification the
[1:18:12] baptism of the Holy
[1:18:16] Ghost what about invisible Union if
[1:18:19] you'll go to it and listen to a prophet
[1:18:22] and he's explaining
[1:18:23] justification and he's explaining it as
[1:18:26] you just repenting of your
[1:18:30] sins then in the same message in a
[1:18:33] little bit he comes around to the
[1:18:36] bases say it's as though you never done
[1:18:40] it he's talking about
[1:18:44] justification going through the same
[1:18:46] message and you'll hear him say the real
[1:18:50] you never did do it right and he's
[1:18:53] talking about
[1:19:00] justification he's talking about from
[1:19:02] partial to
[1:19:03] perfect what about sanctification where
[1:19:06] the unclean Spirit goes
[1:19:10] out then Paul picks it up in his
[1:19:12] writings and he says we're Washed by the
[1:19:14] Water of the
[1:19:16] word cleansing that takes place daily in
[1:19:19] an
[1:19:20] individual in the new birth
[1:19:24] then what about a sanctification that
[1:19:26] comes to S of a Clarity under the seals
[1:19:29] until this world will eventually be
[1:19:32] totally wiped off and
[1:19:36] cleansed partial to
[1:19:39] perfect what about the baptism of the
[1:19:42] Holy Ghost where you're born
[1:19:44] again by
[1:19:50] faith each one of these virtues
[1:19:54] the prophet says you're being birthed
[1:19:57] into these things well I thought we only
[1:20:00] had one birth you got one birth bringing
[1:20:03] you into the
[1:20:05] body but every day ought to be a
[1:20:07] birthing of the
[1:20:10] word what about
[1:20:12] it what about Peter we read Being Born
[1:20:17] Again by The Incorruptible word of God
[1:20:21] which liveth and abideth forever
[1:20:30] what about such a baptism with the Holy
[1:20:32] Ghost that the prophet said will fill
[1:20:34] every fiber of our
[1:20:37] being and take us into
[1:20:41] Rapture what about a baptism that will
[1:20:44] totally baptize this whole world and
[1:20:49] systems so everything goes from partial
[1:20:53] to
[1:20:59] perfect I know brother Gary's listening
[1:21:01] tonight and he came to me one day and he
[1:21:03] said brother Dale I see
[1:21:07] it he said you got to see God in the
[1:21:10] bride
[1:21:14] first I know he's
[1:21:16] listening and he knows the
[1:21:19] answer I said brother you can't do that
[1:21:26] I said you got to see God in Christ
[1:21:30] first before you can see Christ in the
[1:21:37] church partial to perfect amen you got
[1:21:41] to see it in
[1:21:43] Christ then you can see it in
[1:21:47] you you can't see it in you
[1:21:51] first partial to perfect has your
[1:21:55] Revelation dried up has it come to where
[1:21:58] that you were really interested in
[1:21:59] studying the message for a while when
[1:22:01] you begin to to go through the doctrines
[1:22:04] and the ideas and and
[1:22:06] all but then it begin to dry
[1:22:10] up well brother Dale I've dried up on
[1:22:14] you you don't have to tell
[1:22:20] me and hav been preaching too long you
[1:22:22] don't have to tell
[1:22:24] me I know a lot of you is dried
[1:22:31] up but you can't blame
[1:22:35] me CU I'll
[1:22:38] tried I've tried to keep something in
[1:22:41] front of you if it's nothing else but
[1:22:44] a carrot in front of the dony you
[1:22:47] remember the story that's right not
[1:22:50] calling you a donkey or nothing but
[1:22:53] just is the point you're a little
[1:22:55] serious so get your seriousness off get
[1:22:58] something in front of you and hold it up
[1:23:00] what did the prophet say he said hold up
[1:23:02] one subject until they get it before you
[1:23:05] move
[1:23:07] on but yet some of you are even now
[1:23:09] disinterested in the point of me
[1:23:12] preaching so much on the new
[1:23:21] birth I've tried
[1:23:25] okay I'll end it with the story was
[1:23:28] where that
[1:23:29] the old fell preached on something one
[1:23:32] time so much till the deacons got
[1:23:33] together and said ain't there something
[1:23:35] else you can preach on besides just
[1:23:37] repenting and straight enough he said
[1:23:38] let everybody repent straighten up and
[1:23:41] I'll go on something
[1:23:46] else I'm just telling you don't dry up
[1:23:51] in a Time
[1:23:53] when we need the opening of the
[1:23:56] word don't become what is the word
[1:23:59] complacent you know or just sitting back
[1:24:01] relaxing and thinking you know so much
[1:24:03] don't ever do
[1:24:06] that don't think well brother I tell you
[1:24:08] what if if all these other churches
[1:24:10] going we got a pretty good chance of
[1:24:11] going cuz we're way above them in the
[1:24:13] word don't ever think that you got the
[1:24:15] wrong
[1:24:16] idea this pastor has never taught you
[1:24:19] nothing like
[1:24:20] that I've always t your growth
[1:24:24] development tried to feed
[1:24:26] you keep something there to keep you to
[1:24:29] thinking about
[1:24:31] it keep something to where you'd be
[1:24:33] interested in
[1:24:40] studying partial to
[1:24:43] perfect perfect brings you to what a
[1:24:46] positive
[1:24:50] attitude see if I can tell take it down
[1:24:52] here to New
[1:24:54] Birth and handle the whole message down
[1:24:57] here and then handle it going up through
[1:24:59] the statue of perfect man is way just
[1:25:00] finished and everybody knows it went up
[1:25:03] through there and a marvelous job
[1:25:05] bringing out all of these things and
[1:25:06] then can come into a headstone with it
[1:25:10] and not have to get another doctorine to
[1:25:12] start it you know what a lot of people
[1:25:14] in this message think that headstone is
[1:25:17] polygamy
[1:25:20] right now that really run good ain't it
[1:25:23] I don't I wonder where they're negative
[1:25:24] at that or their partial realization got
[1:25:27] started if that's the positive attitude
[1:25:30] to wind up that it's
[1:25:35] polygamy what do you
[1:25:38] think so that's why I'm not discouraged
[1:25:41] with us being here you know a lot of the
[1:25:44] people of the message are totally
[1:25:45] discouraged about being here 40 years or
[1:25:48] after of the Prophet being gone I'm
[1:25:50] tickled to death that's right right
[1:25:53] amen yes sir you know why I'm tickled to
[1:25:56] death because I stood here 40 something
[1:25:58] years ago and told you how this was
[1:26:00] going to go and I got the tapes to prove
[1:26:03] it told you how it's going to wind up
[1:26:05] told you how it's going to
[1:26:10] end you think I don't I don't have no
[1:26:12] problems with being but with people not
[1:26:15] listening to me that's no
[1:26:17] problem that doesn't bother
[1:26:20] me what bothers me is when we claim to
[1:26:24] believe the message
[1:26:28] right you see this man something has
[1:26:30] told you in this man backslide you'll
[1:26:32] see this man
[1:26:34] gone you won't see him hanging
[1:26:40] around but the people of this message
[1:26:42] they just titty tatter
[1:26:44] now past 10 15 years you just had this
[1:26:48] up and down very few doctrines has got
[1:26:50] started if you
[1:26:53] watched it's just kind of up and
[1:26:55] down
[1:26:58] floating cuz they don't know what's
[1:26:59] going
[1:27:00] on the Bible says they that know their
[1:27:04] God shall do
[1:27:06] exploits we have been taught 40 years
[1:27:09] ago what to look for that's taking place
[1:27:17] today
[1:27:20] right why because I believed it I
[1:27:22] believe it now I believe there'll come a
[1:27:24] times I told you Sunday there'll come a
[1:27:26] time when there'll be the Bible the
[1:27:28] prophet said that come since an
[1:27:30] outpouring of the Holy Ghost to fill out
[1:27:32] of our fiber of our being take us in the
[1:27:34] Rapture well you know if it falls on us
[1:27:36] it's going to fall out
[1:27:39] to the people are going to be shouting
[1:27:41] and hollering I told you my message was
[1:27:44] right I told you this two Soul two Lords
[1:27:46] was right look what's taking
[1:27:50] place but then all all at
[1:27:53] once I believe
[1:27:57] this those things will be going there'll
[1:27:59] be a great anointing all at
[1:28:02] once God's going to pull back the
[1:28:05] anointing off of
[1:28:08] everything but the
[1:28:10] bride right I've never made it that
[1:28:13] strong but I believe he'll do it right
[1:28:17] he'll pull it back for a moment cuz the
[1:28:19] prophet said he's going to show her
[1:28:21] right for just a moment well does that
[1:28:24] mean we're going to no you know what
[1:28:26] that could mean that we're preaching to
[1:28:29] 191 countries from Lula Georgia
[1:28:33] right only five more to go we need to
[1:28:38] reach from Lula
[1:28:42] Georgia that don't make you happy amen
[1:28:46] your money is what's doing it y your
[1:28:50] prayers and you're doing is what s
[1:28:52] ending
[1:28:53] this why don't you H get happy about it
[1:28:56] come on brother am let's
[1:28:59] stand come on little
[1:29:03] boy come on
[1:29:06] musicians partial to perfect that's
[1:29:09] right everything I look at is partial to
[1:29:13] perfect y That's Right might not look
[1:29:15] the way you
[1:29:18] look but it's according to the word amen
[1:29:24] amen that it's going to come to a
[1:29:27] place that God's going to
[1:29:30] show who is his
[1:29:34] bride
[1:29:36] amen no not empty in hospitals we don't
[1:29:39] deal in
[1:29:42] that not those type of
[1:29:46] things but somebody's going to stand on
[1:29:49] the word and going to say it don't make
[1:29:51] no difference why what you believe or
[1:29:53] what they believe you know that back in
[1:29:54] about
[1:29:55] 1970 that they were talking about
[1:29:58] Brother Ray can probably remember they
[1:30:00] were talking about that they'd be able
[1:30:02] to some way get together and they'd
[1:30:05] figure out somebody in the message and
[1:30:07] they even Nam some big names preachers
[1:30:09] and would send them over to the to the
[1:30:12] uh World Council of churches to
[1:30:15] represent
[1:30:20] us
[1:30:27] I don't want nobody representing me I
[1:30:30] want Christ amen to represent me amen

[1:30:50] what's revealed to me right
[1:30:53] right I enjoy what other people has to
[1:30:56] say but I still can't do it I can't just
[1:30:58] hear somebody in the message and just
[1:31:00] jump up and grab that message and preach
[1:31:02] it you
[1:31:03] know I can't do
[1:31:07] it I've got to walk alone with the
[1:31:10] word and any true Minister will do
[1:31:15] that if not he's not no true minister of
[1:31:19] God if you don't walk with God and just
[1:31:22] walk along with him that's why I never
[1:31:24] tell these brothers I don't uhuh don't

[1:34:12] claws Lord like our brother was
[1:34:14] testifying to the things that happens
[1:34:17] when we send out these words of praise
[1:34:20] to you
[1:34:22] because that's what these PR claws
[1:34:25] mean and you just take care of the
[1:34:28] needs this there that our brother is

[1:34:47] a
[1:34:50] Christ
[1:34:52] all other ground
[1:34:55] sing all
[1:34:57] other
[1:35:01] sinking you know you always look at the
[1:35:04] natural to see the spiritual I told you
[1:35:07] about it the other day and you may think
[1:35:08] it's crazy but I need to go back and try
[1:35:10] to find the magazine that I was reading
[1:35:12] it in because it wasn't a a tableid you
[1:35:15] know which you know what I mean by that
[1:35:18] you don't know whether of them is true
[1:35:19] or not these others supposed to be
[1:35:22] and they're actually working now with
[1:35:24] thought
[1:35:26] transmitting they have been able to
[1:35:28] transmit to an animal a
[1:35:32] command to get the animal to do what
[1:35:35] they ask it to
[1:35:41] do he said they can transmit thoughts
[1:35:43] one human to
[1:35:45] another you say that's impossible at the
[1:35:49] end of World War II the story was told
[1:35:53] that they already had
[1:35:55] developed a system that they could fly
[1:35:57] an airplane over a city and control the
[1:36:01] minds of the
[1:36:02] people from that
[1:36:06] airplane brother Mo said that they were
[1:36:08] teaching them when at the end of World
[1:36:10] War
[1:36:12] II of decomposing a human body and send
[1:36:15] it to California and put it back
[1:36:17] together he said they can decompose it
[1:36:20] and send it they just just don't know
[1:36:21] how to put it back
[1:36:26] together all of these things you see on
[1:36:28] a lot of these space
[1:36:30] movies what is that guy beam me up whoot
[1:36:34] Scotty beam me up Scotty and the guys go
[1:36:37] straight up to the other
[1:36:40] floor I remember when Superman was
[1:36:43] flying through the
[1:36:45] air Buck Rogers was a space traveling
[1:36:49] from one planet to another and
[1:36:53] had ray guns and this was back in the
[1:36:58] 40s you think they don't have them
[1:37:02] now only in that time they were talking
[1:37:04] about being able to make a
[1:37:08] hovercraft that would be able to keep
[1:37:10] the soldiers from being killed as coming
[1:37:12] in off of the ocean because they had to
[1:37:14] get to the
[1:37:15] land they've got them now that can come
[1:37:18] right in lift right up carry them over
[1:37:20] and Sh them down
[1:37:25] hovercrafts that can just do anything
[1:37:27] they want
[1:37:29] to they're in atomic energy so great
[1:37:32] until they can move
[1:37:36] mountains do you know why that they
[1:37:38] can't put radar too
[1:37:40] low it's got to be above the mountain
[1:37:42] range do you know
[1:37:44] why because that radar will cut the top
[1:37:47] off of that
[1:37:50] mountain
[1:37:52] they're already far Advanced into what
[1:37:55] you
[1:37:59] think when they can capture every word
[1:38:02] that you
[1:38:03] say did not your Prophet say your words
[1:38:06] keeps on
[1:38:08] going they can right now capture all
[1:38:12] that's being said in this
[1:38:14] building and don't have to be here to
[1:38:17] hear
[1:38:19] it science is progressing so
[1:38:23] much because see I
[1:38:26] thought that brother brandham said one
[1:38:28] day we'll just travel like a
[1:38:32] thought just travel like a
[1:38:35] thought you
[1:38:38] know I believe he's
[1:38:41] right you know that they've been dealing
[1:38:43] for quite a while with jet
[1:38:46] airplanes to fly by
[1:38:49] asot connected to the human
[1:38:54] brain the reason is that you take those
[1:38:57] jets flying 2,000 M hour it takes a
[1:39:00] split second for that brain to turn to
[1:39:02] the hands to get it to move but if
[1:39:05] you're doing it with your eyesight you
[1:39:06] just turn your eyesight in the plane of
[1:39:08] dirt goes the way you're
[1:39:10] looking they've been doing that a long
[1:39:14] time we're in a scientific
[1:39:18] age because they have broken into God's
[1:39:21] laboratory is that the words of the
[1:39:28] Prophet the imagination of man's mind is
[1:39:31] what continually
[1:39:34] evil but is ever what he can think of he
[1:39:37] can do
[1:39:38] it that's
[1:39:42] right what about it you believe we're in
[1:39:46] the end
[1:39:47] time you say well why did you bring that
[1:39:49] up because that's part of the message
[1:39:51] because you see you could start off back
[1:39:53] in the early days when we had Oliver and
[1:39:55] Wilbur R trying to fly on airplane for a
[1:39:58] couple of hundred
[1:40:01] feet and the story was told that their
[1:40:03] daddy right before then told his two
[1:40:06] boys because he'd heard about these
[1:40:08] airplanes coming into existence and he
[1:40:10] told his two boys he said Son get up and
[1:40:11] let's get out of here all this here
[1:40:13] heathenism stuff and there was Oliver
[1:40:16] and Wilbur right was the two boys the
[1:40:20] one who flew the first
[1:40:25] plane what do you think about
[1:40:30] it my point without the
[1:40:34] word none of these things would have
[1:40:37] ever come into existence that's
[1:40:42] right what about the word to you Lord
[1:40:47] Jesus we've just committed what we
[1:40:49] believe
[1:40:51] we commit it into your hands and just
[1:40:53] give it we don't deal on scientific
[1:40:57] knowledge that much and you know it the
[1:41:00] people knows that it's just sometimes
[1:41:02] just to stop and think how smart mankind
[1:41:05] has become but it's only because that
[1:41:09] there is an eternal God that is the most
[1:41:13] negative part that could ever be that
[1:41:16] could not be we know but any thoughts of
[1:41:18] negativity in in your realm Lord would
[1:41:21] be so positive it would be far beyond
[1:41:24] Mankind's ideas
[1:41:27] today but we thank you that you've given
[1:41:30] us your
[1:41:31] word and if they just studied your word
[1:41:34] it would saved them a lot of trouble
[1:41:36] Amen to figure out a lot of
[1:41:38] things thank you Father be with us take
[1:41:41] care of the people on the way home be
[1:41:43] with the sick touch each one in Jesus
[1:41:45] name amen you
[1:41:48] dismiss I care today what tomorrow may
[1:41:54] bring Shadow or sunshine or
[1:41:58] rain the Lord I know Ruth or
[1:42:03] everything and all of My worry is
[1:42:08] vain
[1:42:10] living
