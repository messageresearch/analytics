[4:13] amen amen so if you're just staying with
[4:15] me if you don't mind we'll just turn to
[4:17] hebrews chapter 10.
[4:20] just read the scripture here and trust
[4:23] the lord
[4:25] i'm trusting the lord 2021 to be a more
[4:27] wonderful spiritual year
[4:28] than we've ever had in our lives that's
[4:31] how we have to believe
[4:32] hebrews chapter 10 we'll begin with
[4:33] verse 16. this is the covenant
[4:36] that i will make with them after those
[4:38] days saith the lord
[4:40] i will put my laws into their hearts and
[4:42] in their minds will i write them
[4:43] and their sins and iniquities will i
[4:45] remember no more
[4:47] now where remission of these is there's
[4:49] no more offering for sin
[4:52] having therefore brethren boldness to
[4:54] enter into the holiest
[4:55] by the blood of jesus by a new and
[4:58] living way
[4:59] which he hath consecrated for us through
[5:02] the veil
[5:03] that is to say his flesh and having a
[5:06] high priest over the house of god
[5:08] let us draw near with a true heart in
[5:10] full assurance of faith
[5:12] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[5:14] conscience in our bodies washed
[5:16] with pure water amen let's go to him in
[5:19] prayer
[5:19] the gracious kind heavenly father we bow
[5:21] humbly before you in prayer lord and
[5:23] we're so thankful to you lord and
[5:24] humbled by this opportunity lord that we
[5:26] have father
[5:27] lord may this not be another service
[5:28] lord but may each and every one that's
[5:30] gathered here in this sanctuary and
[5:31] those that are gathered downstairs
[5:33] father
[5:34] and lord those that are gathered by way
[5:35] of the internet father lord may you
[5:37] bring deliverance and healing father and
[5:39] forgiveness and may you amend
[5:41] every broken situation father the lord
[5:43] jesus may
[5:44] may we hear from you not from man this
[5:46] evening father
[5:47] and may your people by their faith in a
[5:49] true and resurrected and living god
[5:52] so pull on you father lord that that
[5:54] you'd even take me off my notes if
[5:56] necessary father lord
[5:57] to go get this one and go get that one
[5:59] father where truly we can say did not
[6:01] our hearts burn within us
[6:02] as you talk to us along the way bless
[6:04] every aspect of this service
[6:06] as we commit ourselves into your hands
[6:08] in jesus christ's name
[6:09] amen amen god bless you can be seated
[6:12] this evening with the help of the holy
[6:13] ghost i'd like to speak
[6:14] on a title of going beyond the veil
[6:18] it's very important to go beyond the
[6:19] veil because you know man has always had
[6:21] a desire
[6:22] to see god both believer and unbeliever
[6:25] and many times that is the unbeliever's
[6:27] argument
[6:27] is if god exists then show him to me
[6:31] why can't i just walk in and knock on
[6:33] his door and that is the desire and you
[6:35] know
[6:36] god has put that desire in man to hunger
[6:38] for god
[6:39] to have that hunger job even had that
[6:41] hunger he said you know he wanted to go
[6:42] he wanted to find out where god lived he
[6:44] wanted to go talk to him
[6:45] face to face and man to man but see
[6:48] god has always desired he's always
[6:51] veiled himself
[6:52] he hides himself in creation brother men
[6:54] preach the sermon show us the father
[6:56] and that will satisfy us and he would
[6:59] bring out how god was hidden in creation
[7:01] and god was in hidden in his people and
[7:03] god was hitting his son god has always
[7:05] veiled himself so the unbeliever because
[7:08] they don't see god
[7:10] how they feel like they should see god
[7:12] they quit believing in god
[7:14] so it's okay to have that desire but we
[7:16] as believers
[7:17] have seen god and we see god each and
[7:19] every day because god
[7:21] has given us the eyes to see the ears to
[7:23] hear and the heart to understand
[7:26] because you cannot explain faith you
[7:28] cannot show somebody and explain to them
[7:30] faith
[7:31] the prophet the word prophet messenger
[7:33] of this age
[7:34] preached the unadulterated word of god
[7:37] the faith
[7:38] of this hour the faith of the age to
[7:39] change our bodies but he himself could
[7:42] not give you a revelation
[7:43] he himself cannot impart that faith to
[7:46] you
[7:48] it was he he he ran he ran his race
[7:51] he ran his time and now it's our time
[7:54] and so he preached the word so now
[7:56] it's god's grace and to his elect that
[7:58] when we hear the word
[7:59] we receive it and we act upon it because
[8:03] remember you've got to hear it
[8:04] you've got to receive it and then you've
[8:06] got to act upon it
[8:09] it's just like you've got to be
[8:10] justified you've got to be sanctified
[8:11] and you've got to go on to the holy
[8:12] ghost
[8:13] you stop we're just hearing it and you
[8:15] never believe it
[8:16] or you never or you just recognize that
[8:18] god sent a prophet
[8:20] but you don't go on with that that does
[8:22] you no good
[8:24] you've got to hear it you've got to then
[8:26] receive it and receiving it will then
[8:28] make you
[8:29] act upon it because remember the bible
[8:32] teaches us and we were fellowshipping
[8:33] around about this last night
[8:34] is that works that faith is works
[8:37] express
[8:38] works is not going to save you but when
[8:40] you have faith your life will have the
[8:43] works
[8:44] and then people will see your works and
[8:47] be able to see god in your works
[8:49] because of the faith that you have
[8:51] because you have this same faith that
[8:53] was once delivered to the saints
[8:55] so god loves to hide himself he will
[8:58] hide himself in simplicity
[9:00] and then he'll turn right around and
[9:02] reveal himself in that exact same
[9:03] simplicity brother luis
[9:06] god loves doing that he's a master at
[9:09] hiding himself
[9:10] and he loves it so now
[9:14] moses had met the i am god
[9:17] he had met god in a burning bush
[9:21] so god after he ran from egypt god had
[9:23] instructed him to then go back
[9:25] but moses had an encounter with god
[9:28] himself
[9:29] and there was nobody else that was with
[9:31] moses
[9:33] but they had to believe the testimony of
[9:35] moses
[9:36] now it wasn't just the testimony of
[9:38] moses god gave moses
[9:40] two signs to get the people to believe
[9:43] and that vindicated moses
[9:44] that he in fact was the prophet to lead
[9:46] them out of an exodus
[9:48] to fulfill the promise of god
[9:51] so as they came out of egypt and we're
[9:53] all familiar with the story there came a
[9:54] time
[9:55] where god instructed moses on how to
[9:57] build the tabernacle
[9:58] because god has a provided place of
[10:00] worship god wants to be approached a
[10:02] certain way
[10:04] and that is again the unbeliever wants
[10:06] to come his way
[10:07] well if i can't see god in my way then i
[10:09] guess there is no god
[10:11] if god don't answer me the way i think
[10:12] he should answer me then i guess god
[10:14] don't answer prayer
[10:16] god is god and he has a provided way
[10:20] and the way you contact god is through
[10:23] his provided way
[10:24] through the blood of jesus christ
[10:27] that is how you approach god so there
[10:30] was a tabernacle of witness and they all
[10:31] had it set up a certain way
[10:32] and they had an outer court and they had
[10:34] an inner core also called the holy place
[10:36] then they had the holy of holies and
[10:38] that is where god came down and that's
[10:40] where god came down the pillar of fire
[10:43] and that holy presence is where a dead
[10:45] almond
[10:46] rod that was dead and dried for years
[10:49] and years and aaron
[10:51] had it in there god had him prove
[10:54] and he hadn't proven him and he left
[10:56] that stick in there and it not only
[10:57] butted it bloomed it went through its
[10:59] entire cycle
[11:01] to fruition in that holy presence of
[11:04] jesus christ
[11:05] and that holy presence of god well there
[11:07] was a veil there
[11:09] and man could not go there was only one
[11:12] man
[11:12] a high priest once a year could go in
[11:15] that veil
[11:15] and he had to have a certain approach he
[11:17] had to have a certain walk he had to be
[11:19] dressed a certain way
[11:20] he had to walk a certain way and he
[11:22] could not the bible says he could not
[11:24] enter in there without blood god always
[11:28] requires blood for worship
[11:30] so so the high priest would go in there
[11:32] and he'd sprinkle for his sins
[11:34] for the sins of the people and and ask
[11:37] god to forgive them
[11:39] and god would forgive him based on his
[11:41] plan of redemption
[11:43] because you think of how powerful that
[11:45] was it was the blood of bulls and goats
[11:47] and god almighty would look down through
[11:49] the blood of a bull and a goat
[11:51] and would cover their sin it wouldn't
[11:55] completely do away
[11:56] with it but it would cover it because it
[11:57] was a temporary way
[12:01] so that was though he would sprinkle the
[12:02] blood on god's mercy that was behind the
[12:04] veil
[12:05] so we know that that that as the
[12:07] tabernacle of witness was really just a
[12:09] type
[12:10] of jesus christ when he came he was
[12:13] god's tabernacle of witness he was god's
[12:15] dwelling place
[12:16] he was where the pillar of fire came and
[12:18] rested he was
[12:20] god's mercy and so much can be said here
[12:24] but we're just going to kind of move
[12:25] through it and i know that
[12:26] that these brothers have covered this at
[12:27] different times in different angles
[12:30] but jesus christ was god's mercy seat
[12:33] but when god's mercy seat came in the
[12:35] form of a man he took 16 elements
[12:38] and he came into that body he was god
[12:42] and he was god's mercy seat was in 16
[12:45] elements was in flesh and blood
[12:48] was behind skin was behind a beard
[12:52] walked around got dirty got a headache
[12:56] and that was god's mercy seat but god
[12:58] was veiled
[13:01] and 99 of israel could not go behind the
[13:04] veil
[13:05] and they could not recognize they missed
[13:08] god's message they missed
[13:10] they did not recognize that it was god
[13:12] in jesus christ
[13:14] and just like that mercy seat was the
[13:16] only place for mercy
[13:18] in the old testament jesus christ is the
[13:20] only place for mercy
[13:22] you've got to get to the mercy seat or
[13:25] you'll die in your sins
[13:28] if the blood was not sprinkled on the
[13:29] mercy seat in the tabernacle of witness
[13:33] then god could see their sin
[13:34] [Music]
[13:37] so when jesus was god's mercy seat and
[13:39] they took god's mercy seat and they
[13:40] attacked him to a cruel cross
[13:44] and see a lot of things and let me just
[13:45] say this here
[13:47] many times you can hear the word you
[13:49] hear about jesus dying on the cross
[13:51] and you hear the gospel we cannot let it
[13:53] become mundane
[13:54] we cannot let it become common you hear
[13:57] it and you hear it
[13:59] but it's the truth because a lot of
[14:02] times when you hear the word you might
[14:04] you might hear
[14:05] a lot of these things that have been
[14:06] spoken or next weekend or as a different
[14:09] brothers as a minister you hear the word
[14:11] but it's important because you can hear
[14:13] the same thing one day
[14:14] and you miss it and then you come on the
[14:17] next service and god is trying to get it
[14:19] to you
[14:20] and we're going to get to this a little
[14:21] later on it's important to not be
[14:23] distracted by the veil
[14:25] don't be distracted with who the voice
[14:28] of god comes through that you miss the
[14:30] voice of god himself
[14:33] because god could have ordained the
[14:34] trees to preach the gospel that's right
[14:36] and they do in their own way but god
[14:39] gave man
[14:40] through the foolishness of preaching
[14:42] that is god's way
[14:44] so whenever you hear the word you might
[14:46] how many you know you've heard of
[14:47] brother brain you've heard the same tape
[14:48] over and over but one time you really
[14:49] hear it
[14:50] right you might have listened to it
[14:51] before but one day you hear it
[14:54] that is what that is when faith is
[14:56] quickened brother zach
[14:58] that is when you grab a hold of it and
[14:59] that's what's important not to miss
[15:02] that is like hearing your name so they
[15:05] took
[15:06] god's mercy seat and they nailed him to
[15:09] a cross
[15:10] right and god is a vindication
[15:13] he sent he whenever jesus died the veil
[15:16] of the temple was
[15:17] rent and twain now the veil of the
[15:19] temple was not just a bed sheet
[15:22] it wasn't just some paper thin the
[15:24] theologians tell us that the temple veil
[15:26] was 20 feet wide
[15:28] by 60 feet tall that is six stories
[15:32] that's like a six story building and it
[15:33] was four inches thick
[15:36] and god supernaturally brother wait rent
[15:39] that veil from top to bottom
[15:42] and when he rent that veil it exposed
[15:44] god's true mercy seat
[15:46] which was the lord jesus christ
[15:49] and you find when you read the bible
[15:51] they still missed it
[15:53] because after jesus after they killed
[15:55] him after he rose from the dead
[15:57] they were still partaking in old
[15:59] testament worship
[16:01] scofield tells us that that means they
[16:02] must have re-sown the veil
[16:05] after god supernaturally after he
[16:08] supernaturally rent
[16:09] the veil they passed it off as some
[16:12] natural probably during the earthquake
[16:13] or some natural occurrence and they went
[16:14] back and they
[16:15] sewed it together not realizing that god
[16:17] was finished with that form of worship
[16:22] they were too blind they were too blind
[16:25] to see the supernatural renting
[16:27] and when that suit and when that
[16:28] supernatural renting opened the veil
[16:30] they did not go beyond the veil
[16:32] and see jesus christ is god's
[16:35] so mercy christ was on the cross and he
[16:37] was veiled as i said
[16:38] with 16 elements of flesh
[16:42] and not only did the old the temple
[16:44] they'll have to be rent but jesus
[16:46] christ's
[16:46] own veil had to be rent
[16:50] when he was hanging on the cross this
[16:52] roman soldier literally
[16:53] went there with the spear and pierced
[16:55] the veil he rent the veil
[16:58] and water blood and spirit as we know
[17:00] came out of jesus
[17:02] and that was the birth of the new church
[17:04] that that was that was the birth of the
[17:06] church there and them elements
[17:08] that was the elements of the new birth
[17:10] just as the elements of the natural
[17:11] birth
[17:12] but they couldn't recognize that that
[17:14] was god's mercy seat hanging on that
[17:16] cross
[17:18] because of the veil that god came in
[17:21] and that is the problem in every age is
[17:24] they they trip they cannot go beyond the
[17:26] veil
[17:27] they cannot go in the old testament they
[17:28] would stone the prophets
[17:31] because they could not recognize the
[17:32] word
[17:34] that was being veiled behind the flesh
[17:36] of the prophet
[17:39] so the same thing is repeated in this
[17:41] end time
[17:43] the seals hid christ
[17:46] but there was there was a there was a
[17:47] renting there was a there was an
[17:49] unveiling god had a prophet on the earth
[17:51] that he revealed his seals to and it
[17:54] exposed the enemy but it revealed christ
[17:57] but what can people see they can only
[17:59] see a seventh grade education
[18:00] they can only see a man stumbling over
[18:02] his words they can only see
[18:04] they knew something supernatural was
[18:05] happening but most people couldn't grab
[18:06] hold of it
[18:08] because they were stuck on the veil and
[18:11] even in this end time you have people
[18:13] that can't get past the veil of the
[18:15] prophet
[18:15] they can't see the god that he
[18:17] introduced they can't see the god in the
[18:19] bride
[18:20] they can't see the bride's portion in
[18:21] the word because all they see is the
[18:23] veil it's veiled
[18:24] but you've got to go beyond the veil
[18:27] you've got to go beyond the veil of your
[18:29] own flesh you got to go beyond
[18:31] the veil of the prophet you've got to
[18:33] see that jesus christ was god
[18:35] himself and you see that people still
[18:38] get stuck
[18:39] and they still don't really understand
[18:40] who jesus was
[18:42] they think he's some third person they
[18:44] think he's he's this that or the other
[18:46] they think he's just a prophet
[18:48] the jews to this day are still blinded
[18:52] until them two prophets go to them
[18:54] they're still blinded that's right
[18:55] why because of the veil that god put on
[18:58] because the veil of humanity because
[19:00] they cannot
[19:00] go past the veil
[19:04] so the word was veiled by traditions
[19:07] it was filled by churchianity it was
[19:09] filled by thoughts it was veiled by
[19:11] false doctrine
[19:13] but god sent a prophet in this end time
[19:17] and it struck the veil off the whole
[19:18] thing there's a quote here i'm gonna
[19:20] read a quote where he said he's
[19:21] in plain view just like when the old
[19:24] testament
[19:25] veil was rent from top to bottom that
[19:27] exposed jesus in plain view
[19:31] and they were so blind instead of
[19:33] running to the mercy seat the only place
[19:36] for salvation and mercy
[19:37] they sewed it up and went right back to
[19:40] old testament worship
[19:41] right you had the prophet of god on on
[19:44] in more of a supernatural
[19:45] ministry than just in the from the last
[19:48] 2000 years or more the most vindicated
[19:50] prophet ever
[19:52] receiving the revelation of the seals
[19:54] then you had the world going on
[19:57] how many people were in the tabernacle
[19:59] hearing the seals being preached
[20:00] and went right back to denominationalism
[20:02] went right back to the world
[20:08] and we even see it today people leaving
[20:10] the message
[20:12] going right back to the world in the
[20:14] unveiling of god
[20:16] brethren says now and one time if a man
[20:18] walked through that veil
[20:20] it was sudden death it was literally
[20:23] sudden death to walk through that veil
[20:25] now it's death not to go through it amen
[20:29] if you can't break that veil of
[20:30] tradition
[20:31] break that veil of denomination to see
[20:33] god in his power it's death
[20:35] once where it was death to go in now
[20:38] it's death to stay out
[20:40] the whole mercy seat is setting in plain
[20:42] view anybody can see it
[20:44] the veil is rant glory to god
[20:48] what is the work of the ministry to
[20:49] point you to that mercy seat to say it's
[20:51] rent
[20:52] get to the mercy seat get to the mercy
[20:54] seat
[20:55] it reminds me of them cherubims where at
[20:57] first they were guarding the tree of
[20:59] life
[20:59] and now brother and i said they're
[21:00] running people to the tree of life
[21:03] that is what the difference of
[21:04] redemption made that is that is what
[21:07] that is what jesus died on the cross did
[21:08] for us
[21:11] so don't get caught up that it's just
[21:12] another church service there is just
[21:13] preaching well
[21:14] brother wade is preaching brother dale
[21:16] brother bob brother luis or brother
[21:17] aaron
[21:17] or whoever may be preaching it's just
[21:19] another service every service is a call
[21:23] for you to come up higher every service
[21:26] is a call for you to repent
[21:28] if you're in that situation every call
[21:30] is for the justifier to be sanctified
[21:32] and whatever it's always a call to go up
[21:35] no matter how long how many years you've
[21:37] been born again every service is a call
[21:39] to go up higher
[21:40] to be more like him every service is a
[21:44] call
[21:45] every service is a call to a feast
[21:48] but don't miss it because of the veil
[21:51] right
[21:52] don't miss it right so the veil was torn
[21:58] spirit is pressured aside and it
[21:59] released life and power to the believer
[22:02] it made the new birth possible you can
[22:05] have
[22:06] what david could not have you can have
[22:08] for what david longed
[22:09] to have and could not
[22:12] you can have what abraham longed to have
[22:16] right all these people you read about in
[22:18] the bible that that are your bible
[22:19] heroes and every one of them are heroes
[22:22] and they're your favorite bible
[22:23] characters you can have
[22:26] or you have by the new birth what they
[22:28] long to have
[22:29] what they were looking forward to
[22:33] so now by the new birth you have access
[22:36] to god himself amen
[22:37] remember when god came down on mount
[22:39] sinai if even a a cow or anyone touched
[22:42] it they had to be killed
[22:43] but that god now wants to live in you
[22:46] [Music]
[22:48] you know god was with them and as
[22:50] wonderful as that was the 12 disciples
[22:52] he wasn't satisfied
[22:54] he wanted to be in you brother luis he
[22:56] wanted to be in you brother bob
[22:57] he wanted to be in you sister
[23:00] he wanted it wasn't enough to just be
[23:02] with you he wanted to be in him
[23:06] so now god is veiled in so many ways and
[23:09] god is also veiled in his word
[23:11] and christ is revealed in his own word
[23:13] brother ram said and he
[23:15] so designed that he can hide himself in
[23:17] the scripture to the smartest theologian
[23:19] there is
[23:20] oh my he can just hide himself sit right
[23:23] there in the scripture and you look all
[23:24] day
[23:25] long and never see it look a lifetime
[23:28] and never see it
[23:29] he can just hide himself sitting there
[23:31] now please everywhere
[23:32] let that soak in that god in the word
[23:36] can hide himself so in the word there
[23:38] isn't a theologian
[23:40] or school in the world could ever find
[23:43] him
[23:44] yet he's sitting right there
[23:48] it's so clear to you it's so clear to
[23:51] you
[23:51] and you are so excited and you go and
[23:53] you try and witness to someone
[23:55] but if they're not ordained to life you
[23:58] can't quicken it to them
[24:00] you present it to them
[24:03] and then it's between that individual
[24:04] and god because
[24:06] your coworkers or your own family can
[24:08] get can stumble by the veil
[24:11] they're if they're not stumbled by your
[24:13] veil then they're stumbled by the veil
[24:15] of the prophet
[24:16] they're stumbled by the simplicity of
[24:18] the gospel they're they're they're they
[24:19] stumble at the veil of the letter of the
[24:21] word
[24:22] amen so brother ram teaches us that the
[24:24] prophets were deity veiled
[24:27] now it's not about the flesh that was
[24:30] deity but it's the worth he carried
[24:33] inside of them brother dale that was
[24:35] that was deity so that was a problem
[24:37] with israel like i said they could never
[24:39] identify
[24:40] the prophets for who they were they
[24:43] would stone them
[24:45] they would saw him asunder because of
[24:48] the veil
[24:49] because the veil that was hiding the
[24:50] word they could not see
[24:52] past that veil jesus said o jerusalem
[24:55] jerusalem thou
[24:57] that kill us the prophets that stone us
[24:59] them that are sent unto thee
[25:00] how often would i have gathered thy
[25:02] children together
[25:04] even as a hen gathereth their chickens
[25:05] under her wings and you would not
[25:08] right brother abraham said in the
[25:10] unveiling of god he said in type
[25:12] moses coming from the presence of god
[25:14] with the word of god for that age now
[25:16] watch
[25:17] he said we're in exodus we're now in
[25:19] exodus 19 don't miss this now
[25:22] exodus 19 moses is coming from the
[25:25] presence of god
[25:27] moses is coming from the presence of god
[25:29] he has been into the word
[25:31] the word has been wrote and he in the
[25:33] presence of god
[25:35] with the word he had the word for that
[25:37] age
[25:38] there is a word for each age and moses
[25:40] coming forth his face shines so
[25:43] see the word was in him ready to be
[25:46] manifested
[25:48] give out to the people and brother ram
[25:49] had read his text there i believe he's
[25:51] in first corinthians chapter three
[25:53] the true word god had wrote it and it
[25:56] was with moses notice
[25:57] it was with moses and was ready to be
[26:00] manifested
[26:02] he was the word to them he was the
[26:05] living word
[26:06] hid veiled himself god moses had to put
[26:09] a veil over his own face
[26:11] why he was that word amen
[26:14] until that word was made known
[26:17] moses had to veil himself amen
[26:21] he said do you see it wherever the word
[26:23] is it's
[26:24] veiled and don't ever believe her
[26:28] son or daughter of god shortchange
[26:30] yourself
[26:31] for what's inside of you don't ever
[26:34] shortchange yourself because of the
[26:36] faults of your flesh of what you're
[26:38] really
[26:39] tabernacling inside of you
[26:41] [Music]
[26:43] because remember our flesh is not
[26:45] redeemed our flesh is not born again
[26:48] but satan will have you so busy looking
[26:51] at your flesh
[26:52] you do not realize what you're carrying
[26:55] he will give you spiritual amnesia as
[26:57] soon as he can
[26:58] that you forget who you're tabernacling
[27:03] that you are literally as a messiah
[27:05] you're like literally a mini
[27:07] tabernacle of witness
[27:10] and god despite what your flesh says
[27:13] despite what your human spirit said
[27:15] the pillar of fire god himself deals
[27:17] with your soul on the inside
[27:20] in that throne room that god reserves
[27:22] only for he
[27:24] and you to dwell
[27:28] but you're walking around clocking in
[27:30] your job
[27:31] you're walking around working your
[27:32] business you're walking you're driving
[27:33] around delivering mail whatever your
[27:35] trade or business may be
[27:38] but you're a born-again son or daughter
[27:40] of god
[27:41] tabernacling deity himself
[27:48] now moses had the word now remember
[27:50] after the word was manifest
[27:52] and i want us to hold this in mind
[27:53] because we're going to come back to the
[27:54] statement of the prophet
[27:55] he said after the word was made manifest
[27:58] moses
[27:59] was moses again
[28:02] israel couldn't deify that's why god did
[28:05] away with his body so they couldn't
[28:06] raise an idol
[28:08] in the image of moses he was a a word
[28:11] prophet of that age
[28:14] but he was not acting remember he got
[28:17] out of control when he smote that rock
[28:19] when he should have spoken to it
[28:20] and that kept him out of the promised
[28:22] land so moses was moses when he did that
[28:26] but when he came down with the ten
[28:28] commandments
[28:30] brother brahm taught us that he took the
[28:31] place of god
[28:34] because moses had the word right
[28:37] and the word was getting ready to be
[28:39] delivered
[28:41] see the difference but then after the
[28:43] word was delivered he was moses again
[28:46] he had his habits he had his own temper
[28:48] to deal with he had his own faults
[28:50] he had his own failures he was moses
[28:53] but when he got that word when god spoke
[28:55] to him
[28:56] right the people had to listen remember
[28:58] god swallowed up the earth
[29:00] for people that came against that
[29:01] prophet and what do you see
[29:03] what are we seeing today as people are
[29:05] going against this message
[29:06] the world is opening up and they're
[29:10] being swallowed by the world
[29:13] because they're coming against the word
[29:15] not because they're coming against a
[29:16] a bootlegger's son a man from kentucky
[29:19] it's because they're coming against
[29:21] god's prophet it's because they're
[29:22] coming against his message
[29:24] god will defend his message god
[29:27] vindicates his message
[29:28] [Music]
[29:31] so moses after the word was made
[29:33] manifest moses was moses again see
[29:35] but while the word was in him to be give
[29:38] out
[29:39] he was god and you got to have spiritual
[29:43] understanding to understand that
[29:44] statement
[29:46] remember when people say well you put
[29:48] you know you make uh whenever someone
[29:50] was trying to come and set a trap for
[29:52] brother brown and they
[29:52] said people make a god out of you and
[29:55] what brotherhood said is that that far
[29:56] from the truth is that that far off from
[29:59] the bible
[30:01] but when you have spiritual
[30:02] understanding you don't make a god at a
[30:03] program
[30:04] amen he was god well he wasn't moses no
[30:09] more
[30:09] he had the word of the lord for that age
[30:12] nothing could touch him till that was
[30:14] over
[30:16] he had that word with him so therefore
[30:18] when he come the people turned their
[30:20] heads
[30:20] they couldn't understand they had been
[30:22] changed he was a different fellow he
[30:23] come with that word
[30:25] and he put a veil the bible said over
[30:26] his face for he had the word
[30:28] and he was the word to them your prophet
[30:31] said that you are the final voice of the
[30:33] final age
[30:34] you're the word we are the word
[30:37] incarnate to our generation
[30:40] we are the manifestation of the word the
[30:43] prophet of god said abroad would be here
[30:45] the bible said the bride would be here
[30:48] is she here
[30:51] that's a vindication of the word that is
[30:54] but she's veiled you like to eat you
[30:57] like to sleep you like to go on vacation
[31:00] you have to you get sick just like the
[31:02] rest of the world
[31:04] but is it what do you have on the inside
[31:06] of you
[31:08] that's that resurrection power
[31:12] before the resurrection power get you
[31:14] know raises the saints that passed on it
[31:16] first
[31:16] raised them from their new birth from
[31:18] their first birth i mean
[31:19] that resurrection power
[31:21] [Music]
[31:23] so the same applies to every prophet to
[31:26] every word prophet of every age
[31:28] when they have the word to give out
[31:30] while moses was in the mountain
[31:32] receiving the word the nation of israel
[31:35] was sinning right at the foot of the
[31:36] mountain
[31:38] while brother bran was in in in the
[31:40] mountains receiving the word of the lord
[31:42] vis has having a visitation of seven
[31:44] angels the world was sinning
[31:47] tucson went on and flagstaff in that
[31:49] area went on like it ever did
[31:52] it didn't change the amount of lives it
[31:53] didn't change the amount of adultery
[31:54] didn't change the amount
[31:55] of all these things
[31:59] but yet god was dealing with his prophet
[32:03] let's go to exodus 32
[32:07] and moses turned and went down from the
[32:08] mount and the two tables of the
[32:10] testimony were in his hand
[32:11] the tables were written on both
[32:15] of their sides on the one side
[32:18] and on the other were they written
[32:22] the tables were the work of god and the
[32:23] writing was the writing of god graven
[32:26] upon the tables in revelations 5 1 the
[32:29] bible says and i saw on the right hand
[32:30] of him that sat on the throne a book
[32:32] written within and on the backside
[32:35] sealed with seven seals
[32:37] glory in exodus moses tells us that when
[32:39] he had the tables it were written on
[32:41] both sides
[32:43] i'm gonna read a quote where brotherham
[32:44] types the commandments when he brought
[32:46] them forth
[32:46] as a type of the seven seals see they
[32:49] were both written within and without
[32:52] and moses came as a word of the age
[32:56] the commandments the ten commandments
[32:57] didn't just float down god had him in a
[33:00] man
[33:01] and spoke the word and he had a people
[33:04] to receive it
[33:07] program said the pillar of fire
[33:08] appearing visibly among us identifying
[33:11] that the message is right
[33:12] like he did at mount sinai remember
[33:15] before the true message come forth moses
[33:17] preached
[33:17] and he led them out of egypt but there
[33:20] before the real commandments was laid
[33:22] down
[33:22] the seals was brought in god come down
[33:26] before the people and prove that moses
[33:28] was sent from him that right
[33:29] in a pillar of fire that moses said he
[33:32] had seen in a bush and talked to him
[33:34] i pray you can see a parallel between
[33:35] moses and brother branham
[33:38] brother brandon met an angel and the
[33:40] angel specifically told brother branham
[33:43] as moses was given two signs so will you
[33:45] be given two signs
[33:48] there's a connection between moses and
[33:50] brother branham
[33:54] so they were both given two signs and
[33:55] they both had when moses went and he did
[33:57] exactly what god told them
[33:58] he threw that rod on the ground brother
[34:00] bob and it became a snake
[34:02] but then jen he didn't realize janice
[34:03] and jammers did the same thing
[34:05] brother graham said that he had to just
[34:07] wait and see what god was going to do
[34:09] brother branham had janice and james
[34:11] rise up and try and impersonate
[34:13] the gift that god gave him but brother
[34:16] braham didn't
[34:17] just start attacking him and saying
[34:18] don't listen to them he said he was
[34:20] their folly was made manifest
[34:23] they ended up wrecked up somewhere
[34:27] and see brother graham came on the scene
[34:29] and told us that he met an angel
[34:31] and that he get the people to believe
[34:33] him and all these different things that
[34:34] we know
[34:35] that what would happen and then he would
[34:37] vindicate the prophet over and over and
[34:39] over for
[34:40] all them years just as he vindicated
[34:42] moses
[34:43] brought them through the red sea prove
[34:46] them over
[34:47] and over and over that moses was god's
[34:49] messenger
[34:52] and then it's like he had that capstone
[34:53] when he brought down the commandments he
[34:54] had the law to give him he had the word
[34:56] to give them
[35:00] so let's drop down to verse 26.
[35:03] i'm sorry let's go up to 17 and get a
[35:05] little background and when joshua heard
[35:06] the noise of the people as they shouted
[35:08] he said unto moses there's noise of war
[35:09] in the camp
[35:11] and he said it is not the voice of then
[35:13] it shout for mastery neither is it the
[35:15] voice of them that cry for being
[35:16] overcome
[35:17] but the noise of them that sing do i
[35:18] hear and it came to pass
[35:20] as soon as he came down to the camp that
[35:22] he saw the calf and the dancing and
[35:24] moses's anger
[35:25] wax hot and he cast the tables out of
[35:28] his hands and break them beneath them
[35:29] out let's drop down to verse 26 then
[35:31] moses
[35:33] stood in the gate of the camp and said
[35:35] who is on the lord's side
[35:37] let him come unto me and all the sons of
[35:40] levi
[35:40] gather themselves together unto him
[35:45] and moses being the type of brother
[35:46] brandon brother i'm stood in the gate
[35:48] which is christ and he said in this to
[35:51] this generation he said
[35:52] whoever is on the lord's side let them
[35:55] gather themselves into this word
[35:57] not unto me the man unto this word this
[36:00] banner
[36:01] of the word and who do you have but the
[36:04] sons of levi come in brother
[36:06] said that was the type of the bride
[36:08] though in the book of revelation saying
[36:09] that
[36:10] said that he will make us that he has
[36:11] made us kings and priests
[36:15] and we shall reign with him on the earth
[36:18] why
[36:18] because we recognize we can look past
[36:20] the veil we can go beyond the veil and
[36:22] recognize
[36:23] god manifested right
[36:27] because you could look beyond the veil
[36:30] now the same applies to us in a minor
[36:32] way in a messiah kind of way
[36:36] right and you know let me just also say
[36:39] this
[36:40] that also brings to mind the importance
[36:43] of a true god called ministry
[36:48] because whenever you hear the word
[36:49] preached
[36:51] and satan will try and attack your mind
[36:53] that somebody told them that this and
[36:55] that and this is going on and that's
[36:56] going on
[36:57] and you miss it because of the veil
[37:00] but whenever the spirit of god strikes
[37:02] and is trying to deal with your
[37:03] situation
[37:04] and you pass it off as somebody told
[37:06] them or how do they know or everybody
[37:08] knows it's me
[37:10] you miss it and it's god speaking to you
[37:13] through the veil
[37:13] the minister don't know it no one else
[37:17] may even know it
[37:18] but because you get hung up on the veil
[37:21] you miss it all right amen right
[37:24] so it's important to sit under a god
[37:27] called ministry
[37:28] that when the word comes forth you know
[37:30] that it's pure and you're checking it
[37:32] with the word
[37:33] because the ministry is no don't have
[37:35] its own message the ministry only
[37:37] speaks with a messenger has already
[37:39] spoken
[37:42] so then that makes it deity speaking and
[37:44] not the veil it doesn't make it man
[37:47] but can you recognize it or are
[37:50] are we so stuck on the flesh are we so
[37:53] stuck on personality
[37:57] you have to look past the veil you have
[38:00] to look past your own veil you gotta
[38:01] look past the veil of the minister
[38:03] whoever is bringing
[38:04] the word if not you're going to miss it
[38:09] because the final revelation of the word
[38:10] ends up in the bride
[38:12] the bridegroom call brother said will
[38:14] come through this
[38:16] and where is it going to go in flesh
[38:18] just as it did in jesus
[38:20] the old testament ended up in jesus
[38:21] christ he was a fulfillment of the law
[38:24] and the prophets
[38:26] and the bride is the fulfillment of the
[38:28] word
[38:29] i think you the born again believer the
[38:32] born holy ghost field elect child of god
[38:34] is literally the manifestation of the
[38:36] word just as jesus was
[38:40] by the holy ghost but you could be you
[38:42] again
[38:43] yeah you've got to separate that
[38:46] we're all still we're all still in our
[38:48] ways carnal we still all have on
[38:49] personalities and our own faults
[38:51] but look past the veil look past the
[38:54] veil
[38:56] because everything we say must be backed
[38:58] up by the word
[38:59] we don't have our own word it's got to
[39:01] be backed up by what has already been
[39:03] spoken
[39:04] right so whenever you put the word of
[39:06] mouth the word of god on your on your
[39:08] lips under inspiration and in faith
[39:10] it's like deity speaking you speak to
[39:14] your mountain
[39:16] but then you go to work on monday
[39:17] morning
[39:19] and it's you again
[39:24] but you just overcame devils
[39:28] through your own flesh or through your
[39:29] own will through your own power but
[39:31] through the word of god
[39:33] as deity veiled in flesh
[39:37] but then you sisters have to go clean
[39:39] the house and you're you again yeah
[39:42] still communion with god though
[39:46] you brothers are cutting your grass
[39:48] you're you again the grass has got to be
[39:50] cut
[39:52] but it's deity on that mower
[39:56] see don't get hung up on the flesh so
[39:59] when
[39:59] when we're not when we're not speaking
[40:01] the word we're us again
[40:03] we we can be silly we can just
[40:04] fellowship we can do this that or the
[40:06] other do our own thing but when you put
[40:07] the word
[40:08] of god on your on your lips in faith
[40:13] think about that that is like deity
[40:15] speaking
[40:16] the same deity that said let there be
[40:18] light the same deity that holds this
[40:20] entire world
[40:22] in orbit
[40:25] lives in the soul of an elected child of
[40:27] god
[40:28] [Music]
[40:30] but we can get so hung up on our own
[40:31] flesh
[40:34] and we can't see past our own flesh well
[40:36] i can't do this that's true you can't
[40:39] but quit looking at your veil and look
[40:42] at what you're tabernacling
[40:45] look at what you're tabernacling we're
[40:48] all familiar with the quote but i read
[40:49] he said so when a spirit
[40:51] born spirit-filled man in faith takes
[40:53] the word into his heart and places it
[40:55] upon his lips
[40:56] while that is the same as deity speaking
[40:59] all right every mountain has to go satan
[41:02] cannot stand before that man
[41:04] well we've heard that quote 100 times
[41:07] that's true i have too
[41:08] but one of these times has got to strike
[41:10] faith in our hearts
[41:13] because if you just hear it brother
[41:15] wayne and it just goes over
[41:16] you but we believe it amen that's right
[41:18] but it's got to it's got to grip you
[41:22] and then you can speak to your mountain
[41:24] then he can speak to your situation
[41:27] and you understand that it's not you
[41:31] when jesus went to lazarus's grave
[41:33] program said and he
[41:34] wept like a man and he was sad that his
[41:36] best one of his best friends had died
[41:38] but he said when he put him little
[41:39] shoulders back
[41:41] and he said lazarus come forth right
[41:44] that was more than a man
[41:46] that was god because remember when he
[41:49] got
[41:49] hungry as a man he got hungry he got
[41:51] sleepy
[41:54] but then when he said peace be still
[41:56] right that was god
[41:59] elijah the bible says was a man subject
[42:01] to like passions as we are he was a man
[42:03] but when he walked in the face of a
[42:04] habit said not even dew will fall
[42:07] not even do will fall until i call for
[42:10] it amen
[42:11] amen that was deity speaking out man
[42:13] that wasn't elijah that's right
[42:16] when he when he had that mount carmel
[42:18] showdown
[42:19] that was deity speaking
[42:23] that was god in control of a situation
[42:25] but then whenever he got the letter that
[42:27] threatening letter from jezebel and he
[42:28] ran elijah was elijah again
[42:31] you see the difference but he was god
[42:34] he was god was veiled in elijah god was
[42:37] veiled in elisha
[42:39] god was veiled in brother branham he
[42:40] could sin and he could joke and he could
[42:42] he could cut up like any other man and
[42:44] enjoy the natural things of life
[42:48] sit around a table with his friends and
[42:49] tell a story about a hunt
[42:51] but then all of a sudden when sister
[42:53] hattie wright said the right thing god
[42:54] came
[42:55] over god came and took control god came
[42:57] and took control of his veil
[42:59] and said anything you ask
[43:02] what man can say that what human being
[43:06] in the right mind can say
[43:08] ask anything but do you know that if god
[43:11] reveals it to you right now this church
[43:15] you can receive the same thing
[43:19] because we're not talking about the
[43:20] flesh we're talking about god himself
[43:24] you believe it you receive it the same
[43:26] way hattie wright did
[43:29] and you received the same result that
[43:31] she did
[43:33] you have that childlike attitude that
[43:36] she did of that's nothing but the truth
[43:40] and you bring and you have you hold
[43:42] whatever you need in your heart
[43:44] amen and deity can come down and give it
[43:47] to you
[43:49] whether it's directly or right from this
[43:51] pulpit god can give it to you
[43:54] because it's not the veil it's not man
[43:57] it's god himself that does it man
[43:59] right amen after after that situation
[44:03] brother branham
[44:03] became brother branham again
[44:08] remember i think his sister had her
[44:09] right sister that he couldn't understand
[44:11] he'd pray for her and he prayed for her
[44:13] and he prayed for her and she was sick
[44:14] to the day she died
[44:18] because brother graham could only do
[44:19] what god gave him to do amen
[44:23] brother said now i'm just your brother
[44:25] by the grace of god
[44:26] but when the angel of the lord moves
[44:28] down it becomes then a voice of god to
[44:31] you
[44:34] what if we can receive true
[44:37] anointed god-ordained ministry in the
[44:39] same way right
[44:42] how would that change our church
[44:43] services
[44:46] how would that change things right or
[44:48] are we just looking at the veil
[44:51] that's brother so-and-so preaching yep
[44:53] he usually preaches this long
[44:56] he's your preacher from this angle but
[44:59] to really realize
[45:00] right because there's people that have
[45:02] invaded the pulpits that shouldn't be
[45:03] preaching we know
[45:04] that but the holy ghost in you should be
[45:07] able to discern
[45:08] a gift of god and when that word is
[45:10] coming forth
[45:11] and you receive it in your heart and say
[45:12] that's nothing but the truth god can
[45:14] give it to you
[45:16] if you take it as god's voice to you
[45:20] that doesn't glorify man that glorifies
[45:22] god amen
[45:25] god receives the glory of what happened
[45:26] to sister had he right
[45:28] what would brother ram say a lot about
[45:29] whenever that pillar of fire come down
[45:31] on the river and on the pillar
[45:32] and the picture of the pillar of fire
[45:34] that was taken over him and things he
[45:35] said i was just there when it happened
[45:37] right he said now i'm just your brother
[45:41] by the grace of god but the angel of the
[45:42] lord moves down it becomes then a voice
[45:44] of god to you
[45:45] he said maybe if i offended you by
[45:47] saying that forgive me but i felt that
[45:48] it might be resented
[45:50] but i and god's voice to you see i say
[45:52] that again that time was under
[45:53] inspiration
[45:55] see i felt bad about it the first time
[45:57] but it repeated it
[46:00] brother branham and his humanity and his
[46:01] humility apologize for it and the spirit
[46:03] of god said don't you apologize
[46:05] you say it again receive the word of god
[46:11] that's what it's all about you receive
[46:13] the word for your healing you receive
[46:14] the word for the holy ghost you receive
[46:15] the word for everything
[46:17] for deliverance you can't receive
[46:19] nothing from god
[46:20] without receiving his word that is how
[46:23] you receive something from god
[46:26] amen and if you're constantly stuck on
[46:28] the veil
[46:30] and that can go both ways you cannot
[46:31] lift man
[46:33] too high god will not share his glory
[46:35] with nobody
[46:37] god gets the glory amen so our flesh is
[46:41] the veil that hides god in a born-again
[46:43] believer
[46:44] it's interesting that the first veil was
[46:46] actually made of badger skins
[46:49] have any of you in here ever have y'all
[46:51] petted a badger or anyone petted a
[46:52] badger lately
[46:54] they're mean and that's how our first
[46:57] birth is it's mean
[47:00] it's just it's flesh
[47:04] and that's what that's what the temple
[47:05] veil was made of badger skins
[47:07] among other things because remember our
[47:10] flesh is still not born again
[47:12] amen our natural our five natural senses
[47:15] our spiritual senses or the the human
[47:18] reasoning and imagination all these
[47:19] things that's not boring again
[47:23] you'll think things and imagine things
[47:24] and remember things that aren't of god
[47:27] but that's how you've got to have the
[47:28] holy ghost in there to bring you right
[47:29] back in
[47:30] bring you right back in check that's
[47:32] what matters the holy ghost
[47:34] because if not that's what makes people
[47:36] do things all kinds of crazy things they
[47:37] don't have the top hosts
[47:39] all they have is their flesh and that's
[47:42] a miserable condition to be in
[47:44] to just not have a typos and just do
[47:46] what your flesh feels
[47:48] to do what runs through your mind to act
[47:50] to fly off the handle
[47:51] now we still make mistakes because we're
[47:54] human
[47:56] but we have a heavenly father that
[47:57] forgives us
[48:00] brother ram said in hebrews chapter 6 he
[48:01] says here it is hold it tight
[48:03] the veil talking about the flesh is what
[48:06] keeps us from living the way we should
[48:09] veil is what keeps us from doing the
[48:11] things that we really want to do and
[48:12] paul covers this
[48:14] when i want to do good evil was right
[48:16] there
[48:18] and god became veiled in flesh and the
[48:20] veil was tore in two
[48:21] and god became god again and he raised
[48:24] up that veil that he hid himself
[48:26] that's the resurrection of the lord
[48:28] jesus proving to us that in this veil
[48:30] that we're now hidden by faith
[48:32] we believe it and accept it but when
[48:34] this veil is torn in two
[48:36] i'll go in his presence with this
[48:37] assurance knowing that i know him in the
[48:40] power of his resurrection
[48:41] amen at the coming of the lord jesus
[48:43] this veil will be raised up again in a
[48:45] perfected way
[48:46] till i walk and talk with him as my
[48:48] savior my god when he takes the throne
[48:50] of david
[48:51] and will live forever in this veil after
[48:53] it's been perfected
[48:54] but this veil still has sin in it
[48:57] don't ever think of that glorified body
[48:59] in this earth it's got to die
[49:01] same as your soul has got to die to be
[49:03] born again
[49:04] before we can't see him in these bodies
[49:07] naturally speaking
[49:08] we've got to be changed first this
[49:11] veil's got this natural veil's got to be
[49:13] ranked
[49:14] just like brother brown said your soul
[49:16] has got to be born again
[49:18] that first birth has to be rent so our
[49:21] flesh
[49:22] we're we're speaking in by monica's
[49:24] house they're about angels in the
[49:25] presence of the lord and things
[49:27] and it's our natural it's our flesh and
[49:29] it's our senses that's keeping us from
[49:31] seeing the angels of god encamped right
[49:32] here
[49:34] it is our flesh that keeps us from
[49:37] seeing jesus christ himself walking
[49:38] through these aisles
[49:39] it's our natural senses that keep us
[49:42] from seeing the pillar fire in every
[49:43] service
[49:44] now god will allow us in his grace can
[49:46] still allow you to see them things
[49:49] and open your eyes and things but it
[49:50] doesn't change the fact that he's not
[49:52] here
[49:52] it doesn't change the fact that his
[49:54] guardian angels are not always encamped
[49:55] about
[49:56] about you because he promised he would
[49:59] we go by the word not by what we see
[50:03] paul said he dies daily
[50:06] so our flesh must also be torn so that
[50:08] jesus can be seen in us
[50:13] paul said in galatians 2 20 i am
[50:15] crucified
[50:16] with christ nevertheless i live yet not
[50:19] i
[50:20] but christ liveth in me and the life
[50:23] which i now live in the veil or in the
[50:26] flesh
[50:27] i live by the faith of the son of god
[50:28] who loved me and gave himself for me
[50:32] i love this quote brother m said and i
[50:34] know
[50:36] and they have to have a crucifixion
[50:39] before you can have a resurrection this
[50:40] is a wonderful quote to read right
[50:42] around new year's
[50:42] as we're thinking about the new year i'm
[50:44] trusting god for things that i've never
[50:46] that i've just never experienced i want
[50:48] new heights i want i want greater
[50:49] heights with him
[50:50] i want to know him more than i've ever
[50:51] known him before
[50:53] i want to be so sensitive to his spirit
[50:55] to where if he's pleased i know it if
[50:57] he's displeased i want to know why i
[50:58] repent
[51:00] and that's possible that's not just for
[51:01] ministers that's not just for brothers
[51:04] that's for housewives that's for
[51:05] children
[51:07] that's we're single that's for young
[51:09] single brothers single sisters that's
[51:11] for everybody
[51:13] you can have it he said
[51:16] and before the church will ever be able
[51:18] to see a resurrected power
[51:20] before i can ever see a new ministry
[51:22] take place myself before you can
[51:24] ever enter into a new fellowship with
[51:26] god there has got to be a
[51:29] self-crucifixion
[51:30] so that there can come a resurrection
[51:34] we've got to die out to our own thoughts
[51:37] die out to our own ways
[51:38] die out to everything that's around us
[51:40] go through the trials and tribulations
[51:44] that we might see a new resurrection a
[51:46] new life
[51:47] before a sinner can ever become a
[51:49] christian there has to come a death
[51:51] then a resurrection
[51:54] nobody in their flesh or in their veil
[51:58] loves trials and tribulations
[52:01] but you know the only way to get from
[52:03] one mountaintop and another is go
[52:04] through a valley
[52:07] and that's where the character of god is
[52:08] made we all want god's character
[52:11] we all want to be just like jesus
[52:14] but you're not you don't become like
[52:15] jesus on the mountaintop right
[52:18] you become like jesus in the valley on
[52:20] the mountaintop you ever look back and
[52:21] say thank you lord
[52:23] i can see where i'm more like you than i
[52:24] was on that other mountaintop
[52:26] and back in the valley you go back in
[52:29] the valley you go
[52:32] so we must look beyond our own flesh and
[52:34] human spirit
[52:35] to see god working in you and
[52:38] in each other amen we cannot get as
[52:42] as it keeps getting repeated you cannot
[52:45] get so hung up on your flesh
[52:46] you cannot get so hung up on what
[52:48] someone said to you or what someone did
[52:51] in the flesh were they in the flesh yeah
[52:55] but you can't get hung up on it you got
[52:58] to look past that you got to see the
[53:00] intentions you got to see
[53:01] the god that's on the inside
[53:05] they need more of god but so do you
[53:08] so do i we all need more of god
[53:12] everybody needs more of god so let's not
[53:15] get hung up on that veil
[53:16] all right brother and uh romans 10 6 but
[53:20] the righteousness which is a faith
[53:21] seeketh on this why say not in that
[53:22] heart
[53:23] who shall ascend into heaven that is to
[53:24] bring christ down from above
[53:26] or who shall descend into the deep that
[53:28] is to bring christ again from the dead
[53:29] but what saith it the word is nigh thee
[53:33] even in thy mouth and in thy heart that
[53:37] is the word of faith which we preach
[53:40] a holy ghost believer gets sick or
[53:42] there's someone in their home that's
[53:43] sick
[53:44] they can't get a hold of the pastor well
[53:45] no what am i going to do
[53:47] how am i going to get god here how am i
[53:49] going to get how am i going to bring
[53:50] deliverance to this person
[53:52] the word of god is naive and even in thy
[53:55] mouth
[53:56] well i'm not a preacher it doesn't
[53:57] matter well i'm not a brother it doesn't
[53:59] matter
[54:00] i'm not a grown-up it doesn't matter
[54:04] you have god amen if you're born again
[54:07] you've got the deity of god
[54:09] in you it's not where am i going to go
[54:12] to find god
[54:14] how am i going to bring god on the scene
[54:16] right
[54:17] paul said he's naive in thy mouth an in
[54:20] thine heart
[54:22] that is the word of faith which we
[54:24] preached
[54:28] he's with you he's a very present help
[54:30] in a time of trouble
[54:33] but if you're always putting yourself
[54:34] down and you're allowing the devil to
[54:36] put you down
[54:38] i can't i you know you think of a
[54:39] parable of someone that you know
[54:41] that may that you've got you've got the
[54:43] king with you
[54:46] he is your personal he he's your
[54:49] personal bodyguard
[54:51] but yeah you're always walking in fear
[54:55] but yet you've got the king himself is
[54:58] by you and he's not only by you he's in
[55:00] you
[55:02] but you're always looking for god
[55:04] somewhere else
[55:06] because satan keeps beating you up in
[55:08] the flesh
[55:10] satan keeps beating you up in the flesh
[55:12] and he keeps working you around your
[55:14] emotions
[55:16] but you've got god in you by the holy
[55:19] ghost you have god
[55:20] in you he's nigh you he's in your heart
[55:22] and he's waiting to be called on the
[55:24] scene
[55:29] the disciples were on a boat and they
[55:32] were testifying
[55:34] they were testifying about all the
[55:35] things that god has done
[55:37] they were so excited they've seen god
[55:39] jesus do so many things and how he fed
[55:41] the 5
[55:41] 000 and how he healed the leper and what
[55:43] what he might how he delivered
[55:45] legion and all these different things
[55:48] and then their own storm arose
[55:51] and they got so distraught of trying to
[55:53] bail all the water out of the boat and
[55:55] trying to row the boat to land and this
[55:57] and that
[55:57] they forgot who was in the boat with
[56:00] them
[56:02] they forgot that the the that the king
[56:05] of kings
[56:06] that the god who created the water that
[56:09] satan had stirred up
[56:12] was in the boat with them and they begin
[56:14] to cry and they begin to fear and they
[56:16] begin to
[56:17] to to to think they were going to die
[56:21] and that's what satan's intention was
[56:23] but they remembered
[56:24] who was in the boat with him you've got
[56:28] to remember who's in your boat
[56:30] you've got to remember who resides in
[56:32] you
[56:33] and you've got to wake him up
[56:37] you've got to wake him up brother ram
[56:39] one time even typed it like he's
[56:40] sleeping between revivals
[56:42] and you can get caught up in the flesh
[56:44] and you can and you can just go a long
[56:46] time
[56:47] and you've got to remember who's in your
[56:49] boat who's in your soul
[56:51] if you have god in your soul it doesn't
[56:54] matter what storm satan tries to put you
[56:56] through
[56:57] right it doesn't matter what you're
[56:59] going through in life
[57:01] wake jesus up wake him up in your boat
[57:06] how do you wake him up prayer
[57:10] faith attendance to his word
[57:14] and you wake him up and he'll stand on
[57:17] the brow of your boat
[57:19] and he'll speak peace to your storm
[57:21] he'll bring you deliverance
[57:24] but you've got to wake him up
[57:27] you've got to wake him up brother graham
[57:31] said in awakening jesus he said you know
[57:32] what he's doing
[57:33] he's here tonight waiting to be proved
[57:36] now don't think of this in 1963.
[57:38] he's here on december the 31st 2020
[57:43] after a rough year for the world
[57:48] and he's waiting to be proved right
[57:51] right that's right you know what you
[57:53] ought to do you ought to do like they
[57:55] wake jesus that's in us wake jesus in
[57:59] your own lives
[58:00] the god that sets your soul of fire with
[58:02] the holy ghost that
[58:03] the god that taken these blinded eyes of
[58:05] mine opened them up the god that raised
[58:06] me off of a deathbed
[58:08] the god that i seen bring the dead back
[58:09] after being dead for hours the doctor
[58:11] pronounced dead and write a statement to
[58:13] it five different times awaken that god
[58:16] wake him him up we ought to call jesus
[58:18] on jesus and wake him
[58:20] and call him on the scene we have need
[58:22] of him yes sir
[58:25] how many have in need of the lord you've
[58:28] got a need of the lord hold that need in
[58:30] your heart
[58:31] and with faith you awaken jesus
[58:36] and if he if the disciples are able to
[58:38] wake him up in the natural
[58:40] how much more can you wake him up on the
[58:41] inside how much more can he respond to
[58:43] faith
[58:44] how much more can he respond to our
[58:46] hearts cry
[58:50] he said awaken that god waken him up we
[58:54] ought to call g
[58:55] on jesus and wake him and call him on
[58:56] the scene we have need of him yes sir
[58:59] then call him to confirm his word if we
[59:02] wake him up
[59:03] get him stirred up in us till our own
[59:05] doubts and frustration has passed away
[59:07] now call him and say lord you promised
[59:10] a little while and the world would not
[59:12] see you would see you no more
[59:13] and i'm not of the world you pray that
[59:16] i'd be not of the world
[59:17] and i'm not of the world i'm yours
[59:20] and you said the world will see me no
[59:22] more yeah you'll see me uh-huh you'll
[59:24] see me lord
[59:26] i want to disturb you i want to arouse
[59:29] you out of my own sleeping body
[59:31] my own sleeping heart of these realities
[59:34] waken
[59:34] jesus come to me then the doubts and
[59:37] fears will cease
[59:40] and you can be backslidden maybe not
[59:42] talk to him for a long time
[59:44] but he's still there right where you
[59:46] left him
[59:47] he's still there go to him wake him up
[59:51] right and he'll rise on the scene
[59:55] they recognize if they would have been
[59:56] stuck on just on not knowing who he was
[59:59] but they knew who to run to by the way
[1:00:01] in a time of trouble
[1:00:03] they knew that that body that that
[1:00:06] whatever five foot something
[1:00:08] frame that frail looking frame that
[1:00:10] looked to be 50 years old or more
[1:00:13] they knew that that body tabernacled the
[1:00:15] god of abraham
[1:00:17] they knew that tabernacle bodied he was
[1:00:19] the messiah
[1:00:22] they weren't hung up on his flesh
[1:00:26] it's time we as message believers go
[1:00:28] beyond the veil
[1:00:29] it's time that we as message believers
[1:00:31] go beyond just the natural things
[1:00:34] it's time that we as message believers
[1:00:35] go just beyond the tape
[1:00:37] of the letter of the of the books or
[1:00:39] maybe just the sound of the prophet's
[1:00:41] voice go into what he said
[1:00:43] go into who he introduced go beyond that
[1:00:45] veil
[1:00:47] now we know that god brother ram said
[1:00:49] that god ordains his prophets in certain
[1:00:51] ways or certain personalities to catch
[1:00:53] the people
[1:00:54] but go beyond that go beyond the god
[1:00:57] that he introduced
[1:01:00] go beyond the the veil of your own flesh
[1:01:03] and awaken jesus
[1:01:05] don't get stuck on flesh look beyond
[1:01:09] that
[1:01:10] because the god of heaven the god that
[1:01:12] you think the prophets were deity
[1:01:14] veiled and with
[1:01:17] i think the very when they would say
[1:01:19] thus saith the lord that wasn't thus
[1:01:20] saith the prophet
[1:01:22] right that was thus saith the lord
[1:01:27] so whenever you repeat thus saith the
[1:01:31] lord
[1:01:32] it's not the say of brother terrence
[1:01:36] if he's speaking what has already been
[1:01:37] spoken as thus saith the lord is still
[1:01:40] thus saith the lord it's still deity
[1:01:45] rolling off of our lips
[1:01:48] you think what a mighty god we serve
[1:01:52] you think of what almighty god that he
[1:01:53] would take clay that he would take
[1:01:54] humanity
[1:01:55] and he'd make a way that we can be born
[1:01:57] again right
[1:01:59] fallen sons and daughters of god he'd
[1:02:01] make his brother zack a way that we can
[1:02:03] be born again
[1:02:04] and he would actually speak through our
[1:02:07] lips
[1:02:09] and if you can look past the veil if he
[1:02:11] can look past the messenger
[1:02:13] if you can look past the flesh of one
[1:02:15] another
[1:02:17] you can hear from god if you can look
[1:02:20] past the veil of one another you could
[1:02:22] be out there fellowshipping and god can
[1:02:23] speak to you
[1:02:24] god doesn't quit speaking when the
[1:02:25] minister steps off that's right
[1:02:28] when the songs go forth god's still
[1:02:30] speaking when a brother comes up here
[1:02:32] bows his heads and prays god is still
[1:02:33] speaking
[1:02:34] when y'all come in and get settled in
[1:02:36] and start getting those minds on the
[1:02:37] lord
[1:02:37] and they play the portion of the message
[1:02:39] god is speaking amen
[1:02:41] god is speaking from the moment you walk
[1:02:43] in and he don't quit speaking
[1:02:45] right he should be speaking to you and
[1:02:47] you should be speaking to him before you
[1:02:48] walk through the doors and you come
[1:02:49] expecting
[1:02:52] if you just come with your mind filled
[1:02:53] up with the things of the world and we
[1:02:54] all have to get cleansed we all have to
[1:02:56] forget about tomorrow we all have to
[1:02:57] forget
[1:02:57] about what was done today and we've got
[1:02:59] to ask god to help us to get our minds
[1:03:02] in a mindset to receive the word
[1:03:06] to receive the word and not just see a
[1:03:08] brother standing here speaking the word
[1:03:10] but to realize that that's for me that's
[1:03:12] the word of god that he's speaking
[1:03:16] so god help us as we as i just begin to
[1:03:18] close
[1:03:19] god help us in this new year in this end
[1:03:21] time you know we have a
[1:03:23] i just have a thirst for god like i've
[1:03:24] never had before and i believe you do
[1:03:26] too
[1:03:27] or you won't be here till midnight
[1:03:30] to have a thirst for god like we've
[1:03:33] never had before
[1:03:34] glory there's many things we don't
[1:03:36] understand with all this covid and all
[1:03:37] these things we have to do to just make
[1:03:39] a way
[1:03:39] but god sees your faithfulness it's not
[1:03:42] convenient for anyone to wear a mask
[1:03:43] it's not convenient for anyone to not be
[1:03:44] able to
[1:03:45] to fellowship like they want and all
[1:03:46] they do these different things
[1:03:49] but god sees your faithfulness that
[1:03:51] you're still in the house of god
[1:03:52] you're still pulling on the gifts of god
[1:03:54] you're still here supporting the church
[1:03:57] god sees it and god recognizes it you're
[1:04:00] not getting stuck on the flesh well it's
[1:04:01] comfortable right it's uncomfortable for
[1:04:04] everybody
[1:04:05] but god is still making a way god's
[1:04:08] gospel is still going forth souls are
[1:04:10] still being saved people are still
[1:04:11] getting the holy ghost
[1:04:13] this message is still being translated

[1:04:16] the world
[1:04:18] god is still getting his bride ready
[1:04:21] regardless of how many masks they try
[1:04:22] and you know the governments and things
[1:04:24] may make us aware
[1:04:26] god is perfecting a bride and we're
[1:04:28] going to be without spot
[1:04:30] or wrinkle now god is not looking at
[1:04:33] your flesh when he said that

[1:48:23] a little bit later on
[1:48:25] as we all know you know mom and dad both
[1:48:27] had to cut look at mama
[1:48:29] she had to covet and you know mom
[1:48:32] she she had it more in her or up here
[1:48:35] and it didn't bother as much of course
[1:48:36] she went to hospital she's still having
[1:48:38] trouble with it
[1:48:39] but uh you know dad took care of her all
[1:48:41] that time and we never even went in the
[1:48:43] house down there we never went in
[1:48:45] not a one time we didn't get around them
[1:48:47] or nothing and
[1:48:48] dad took care of her so then dad got it
[1:48:52] it was on a sunday it was like a kick
[1:48:55] pretty much was like a kick in the gut
[1:48:56] because i thought he was just sick like
[1:48:58] he'd get sick you know
[1:48:59] coughing and trying to get some
[1:49:02] attention and stuff like that
[1:49:04] but then he went got tested so i had to
[1:49:06] say well you know he had it
[1:49:08] so i was supposed to do this about a
[1:49:11] month or two ago but i didn't do it
[1:49:14] uh and then you know through the time
[1:49:18] of monday through thursday dad was sick
[1:49:21] mom was taking care of him and of course
[1:49:23] i'm gonna tell you this
[1:49:24] don't never get my mom to be your nurse
[1:49:26] if she was your nurse
[1:49:28] y'all were in trouble of course we knew
[1:49:29] that growing up me and wade and anna of
[1:49:31] course i think i was more than them but
[1:49:33] because i tried to get out of school i'd
[1:49:35] say well you know my stomach's hurting
[1:49:37] take me to the doctor stick him
[1:49:38] here and get him married get him here
[1:49:40] you know of course you know it worked
[1:49:42] some but some of it it didn't
[1:49:44] but mom and dad he'd be down there
[1:49:46] sitting outside and mom would be
[1:49:48] have that little what's that little
[1:49:49] thing called oxygen level and he'd have
[1:49:52] one finger out
[1:49:53] his mouth open like a bird because she
[1:49:55] was taking his chimp here
[1:49:57] every 15 minutes his temper birch i mean
[1:50:00] check oxygen it'd be 83 didn't he
[1:50:02] did he well i'm not gonna do that but
[1:50:04] then he'd go he'd do the bird finger out
[1:50:06] and then you check in it'd be 91 well
[1:50:08] the doc ruth or some of the other ones
[1:50:11] when we appreciate ruth
[1:50:12] uh mcferron she helped a lot
[1:50:17] check this finger and it'd be 91 and
[1:50:19] then then five minutes later
[1:50:21] be back in his mouth again this finger
[1:50:24] would be 88
[1:50:25] and you know just trying to find it to
[1:50:27] get it better you know rub this finger
[1:50:29] go put it in hot water and
[1:50:31] bring it out so all that went on from
[1:50:33] monday to thursday
[1:50:34] and then mom called me on friday i mean
[1:50:36] we we talked to each other we didn't go
[1:50:38] down there
[1:50:38] at all we never went in until friday
[1:50:42] i went down mom called me let's see i'm
[1:50:45] trying to read my writing that i wrote a
[1:50:46] long time ago
[1:50:48] mom called me on friday she was real
[1:50:51] upset course all the time and then all
[1:50:52] that time during the time he'd run a
[1:50:54] temperature and
[1:50:55] you know he just he couldn't breathe and
[1:50:58] you know just doing crazy stuff really i
[1:51:00] think it was just a lot of her
[1:51:02] attention but one day we'll know and he
[1:51:05] he's not never going to
[1:51:06] say that but anyway she called me she
[1:51:09] said dad
[1:51:10] has got the thermostat at 52 degrees in
[1:51:14] this house
[1:51:16] crying and you know all upset so i said
[1:51:18] well i got to go down there it's my
[1:51:20] first time
[1:51:22] so i go down there i didn't put on
[1:51:24] gloves and we all talk about masks and
[1:51:26] all this about that
[1:51:27] i wore a mask every time i went in there
[1:51:29] and i'm going to tell you
[1:51:30] 100 i got the covet from him
[1:51:34] because i you can ask after that i went
[1:51:37] to the roof of their house
[1:51:38] unless it was a plane that dropped it
[1:51:40] and if you've ever been at my mom dad's
[1:51:42] house
[1:51:43] there's airplanes that come on every one
[1:51:45] minute there's a landing area
[1:51:46] and if unless they dropped it out of
[1:51:48] that he gave it to me
[1:51:49] okay we understand that which is fine
[1:51:51] but i had a mask on
[1:51:52] every time i went down there dumb but
[1:51:54] anyway i went in down there
[1:51:56] he had set to he got hot and set the
[1:51:59] thermostat at 52 degrees
[1:52:01] of course you can imagine what that is
[1:52:03] in your house i mean
[1:52:04] you know it was cold mom's over in the
[1:52:06] corner doing this
[1:52:08] so i told him i said now look and he
[1:52:09] knows this stuff he knows
[1:52:11] i mean you don't have to he was saying
[1:52:13] well if you turn the thermostat way down
[1:52:15] then it's supposed to get colder yeah
[1:52:16] right but it don't blow no ho
[1:52:18] no more to get to 52 than it does to get
[1:52:21] from 70 down to 69.
[1:52:23] so i mean he was but he was running a
[1:52:25] temperature
[1:52:26] and he wasn't thinking all exactly right
[1:52:29] so
[1:52:30] the next day next day let's see saturday
[1:52:33] you know we go through and talk and
[1:52:35] everything on saturday evening mom calls
[1:52:37] i can't breathe down here daddy's done
[1:52:40] something to the
[1:52:41] thermostat again crying and all upset so
[1:52:44] i go down there
[1:52:45] he had run it to 80. he'd run it up to
[1:52:47] 80 because he got cold
[1:52:50] another day you know and mom's down
[1:52:52] there you know out the back door can't
[1:52:54] breathe
[1:52:56] so we get it squared away so i've been
[1:52:58] down there friday and saturday
[1:53:00] you know in the house like i said we i
[1:53:02] messed up and everything and
[1:53:04] that's but then now sunday we went down
[1:53:07] there
[1:53:08] we i don't know if we had two services
[1:53:09] but we all went down there
[1:53:11] and i knew something was wrong with dad
[1:53:13] because he didn't he didn't want to come
[1:53:15] come outside i even think hudson might
[1:53:17] even come around
[1:53:18] and he he just like oh i won't go back
[1:53:20] inside we'd all usually what we've done

[1:57:08] like i said she helped
[1:57:09] mom and dad tremendously while he wasn't

[1:57:32] they had moved him
[1:57:33] you know and nobody knew but john penny
[1:57:36] found
[1:57:37] on tuesday which was kind of funny
[1:57:40] but anyway wednesday this is another
[1:57:43] trying time
[1:57:45] lisa called we would call every day to
[1:57:47] the hospital
[1:57:48] three or four times and the doctor when
[1:57:50] i was talking about the when i said the
[1:57:52] coveted cocktail and i'm not making fun
[1:57:53] of the
[1:57:54] doctor because daddy knows the doctor
[1:57:57] was
[1:57:58] probably indian more and he would tell
[1:58:00] me he said terence
[1:58:02] we've got him on the covet cocktail he
[1:58:04] will we would get him through he on the
[1:58:06] covet cocktail
[1:58:08] every time i talked to him and he would
[1:58:09] call he was really good they was good
[1:58:11] about calling
[1:58:12] really good but on wednesday lisa called
[1:58:16] up there and they said
[1:58:17] she got a hold of a nurse and can we
[1:58:20] check on samuel and they said
[1:58:21] well his level they go on levels of
[1:58:24] oxygen so his levels went from eight to
[1:58:26] ten
[1:58:26] and so the next level he goes is to the
[1:58:29] ventilator
[1:58:30] now all you all know what happened to
[1:58:31] brother ray montgomery and y'all don't
[1:58:33] a lot of you may not know but when this
[1:58:35] first thing came out
[1:58:37] i hope i ain't taking too much time i'm
[1:58:38] sure uh
[1:58:40] when this first thing came out 80
[1:58:42] percent of the people
[1:58:44] that went on ventilator passed away 80
[1:58:46] percent of them
[1:58:47] in march april and all that now it's
[1:58:50] down to 40
[1:58:51] 45 percent now but
[1:58:54] that was what they said and we was on a
[1:58:56] group text i'm not
[1:58:57] i don't get involved with that that much
[1:58:59] wade and all them was on so everything
[1:59:01] went to everybody
[1:59:03] and the only thing i said was i said
[1:59:06] no and i meant it with a big no and if
[1:59:09] i'd have been a sinner it would have
[1:59:10] been something else in front of that no
[1:59:12] i said he ain't going on november
[1:59:25] wednesday i got off the roof of course
[1:59:27] that's what we said and i told him i
[1:59:28] said no
[1:59:29] he ain't going on no ventilator it ain't
[1:59:31] gonna happen so
[1:59:32] i called the nurse got out of his real
[1:59:36] nurse and she said oh
[1:59:37] said he went from a ten down to a eight
[1:59:40] which was good news
[1:59:41] really good news i said have the doctor
[1:59:44] call me
[1:59:45] i mean as soon as he can't she said well
[1:59:47] he ain't calling i said no i said i want
[1:59:49] to talk to him
[1:59:50] he calls me up hey mr terence how are
[1:59:52] you doing he's still on the covet
[1:59:54] cocktail
[1:59:56] but anyway he said he said i don't know
[1:59:58] where you got this information
[2:00:00] he said he went from an eight to a five
[2:00:03] and said he's going home on friday
[2:00:12] well thursday morning i got up i
[2:00:14] couldn't get out of the bed

[2:35:06] done all the music all the
[2:35:08] singing all the things that has
[2:35:10] transpired among us
[2:35:11] and we appreciate all of the kids and
[2:35:13] their thing
[2:35:14] this this thing it used to be when we
[2:35:17] first started this little building here
[2:35:19] we
[2:35:21] 1971 we had about
[2:35:23] probably about 18 people i guess and
[2:35:26] something like that and
[2:35:27] well brother colley he he had to go
[2:35:30] finally to
[2:35:31] learn music where he could start a song
[2:35:34] off because none of us couldn't sing or
[2:35:36] none of us couldn't do nothing
[2:35:38] you know and also he had to get all of
[2:35:40] that straightened up and
[2:35:41] and then but god's been good to us he
[2:35:44] sent us people
[2:35:45] that know how to sing he sent us
[2:35:47] ministers that know how to preach
[2:35:50] now i'm going to say this and she may
[2:35:52] not like it but that's all right
[2:35:55] do you realize that we have one among us
[2:35:58] playing
[2:35:59] and she sung a song just that tonight
[2:36:02] she wrote a lot of songs
[2:36:06] she has wrote a lot of songs
[2:36:09] she could be with sherry and easter
[2:36:14] that's no joke
[2:36:18] but yet she chose to just be herself
[2:36:23] still write songs still have a good time
[2:36:26] doing it man
[2:36:27] but just not let it run all out
[2:36:31] well thank god for those type of people
[2:36:35] stand here and testify the things among
[2:36:37] them
[2:36:41] and the way you came and the way
[2:36:43] everything happened
[2:36:46] it's it's this is not no haphazard thing
[2:36:52] it's all for planned for name
[2:36:56] all working out for the honor and glory
[2:36:58] of the lord amen
[2:37:00] because he's the one that'll do it
[2:37:05] we're promised that we don't have to
[2:37:07] worry about things
[2:37:09] we start a year nobody knowing what's
[2:37:13] going to take place
[2:37:15] what could take place but that's all
[2:37:17] right i know who's in charge
[2:37:20] i know who's going to take care of all
[2:37:22] of us everything will be done
[2:37:24] but we just give him the honor and the
[2:37:26] glory
[2:37:28] for it all amen we praise him because
[2:37:31] he's the great
[2:37:32] i am and that's that's something to
[2:37:36] think about
[2:37:37] that we could know about god
[2:37:41] i remember when i was in the baptist
[2:37:45] and thinking about that i read the bible
[2:37:49] i studied it and you know i had a good
[2:37:52] memory
[2:37:54] and and and all of that i i
[2:37:59] i loved the word what i always thought
[2:38:04] when i'd read that about him being
[2:38:06] killed and
[2:38:08] all he ever done was good that's right
[2:38:11] all he ever done was good all they ever
[2:38:13] done was bad
[2:38:14] i couldn't understand that because we
[2:38:16] were supposed to be the religious people
[2:38:20] and we baptist we like the prophet said
[2:38:23] don't tackle them baptists because they
[2:38:24] know a little bit what they're talking
[2:38:26] about you know that we wouldn't pay our
[2:38:28] tithes to the baptist church
[2:38:34] we did but you know how we paid it
[2:38:38] we designated it to go to
[2:38:41] missionary work because i had learned
[2:38:45] enough
[2:38:46] from the word that i wasn't going to try
[2:38:49] to support a church
[2:38:52] still don't got that same idea
[2:38:56] just put everything to god and let him
[2:38:58] take care of it
[2:39:01] just let him tell he'll take care of it
[2:39:04] he'll show you what everything is and
[2:39:06] all about it
[2:39:08] but we just appreciate you appreciate
[2:39:10] you coming appreciate the church
[2:39:11] people for being here and appreciate
[2:39:14] those out there on the internet because
[2:39:16] we're getting a lot of response from a
[2:39:18] lot of the countries and things and
[2:39:21] never thought that ever happened because
[2:39:23] when when the brothers here they
[2:39:27] come to him and ask me he said why can't
[2:39:29] we go on internet go whatever what you
[2:39:31] call it y'all called the names of
[2:39:33] youtubes and whatever uh i i don't know
[2:39:37] but
[2:39:38] you know i said but we can't do that
[2:39:40] because first message i put out there
[2:39:44] i'm going to get beat to death over that
[2:39:46] internet about what i'm saying
[2:39:49] and they went on i said okay so it kept
[2:39:52] going and finally some of them kept
[2:39:54] talking well let them listen if they
[2:39:56] want to listen if they don't want it let
[2:39:58] them forget it
[2:39:59] it's okay open up put it on there
[2:40:02] i thought that we would get you know i
[2:40:05] thought the mailbox would be stacked
[2:40:07] full of
[2:40:09] contradictory things you know that i'd
[2:40:11] been preached about
[2:40:13] but you know what i never got a one
[2:40:18] never got a a person to write in
[2:40:21] and say you're wrong
[2:40:25] and i thank god for that because i
[2:40:29] believe it's the word
[2:40:31] i believe he's took care of us all of
[2:40:33] these years and everything's done
[2:40:38] we enter a new year we're here you're
[2:40:40] passing the time now
[2:40:42] so come on brothers and we'll have to
[2:40:43] have the communion and everything so
[2:40:45] just do as you're told that white's
[2:40:46] gonna
[2:40:47] just do as you're told and trying to
[2:40:49] line up and do it and we'll be through
[2:40:51] it all and
[2:40:52] just everybody take care on the way home
[2:40:54] be careful
[2:40:55] and all like that because you know it is
[2:40:58] a night out there but
[2:40:59] we're up here celebrating jesus christ
[2:41:02] let the world do what they're doing
[2:41:04] so let's just turn it over to them okay
[2:41:07] amen it's a new year 1201
[2:41:12] so here we are and and this year
[2:41:16] if you want if the lord carries um
[2:41:19] watch night service this year coming up
[2:41:21] 2021 will be the 50th
[2:41:23] right this will be the 50th anniversary
[2:41:26] year of our
[2:41:27] church being established in july the 4th
[2:41:30] 1971. so we're in our jubilee year
[2:41:34] golden jubilee not just
[2:41:37] jubilee golden jubilee we'll be in our
[2:41:40] 50th year
[2:41:41] and i was thinking we were joyce and i
[2:41:43] are
[2:41:45] grew up in this church and i was 11. of
[2:41:48] course she was
[2:41:48] she was born in the 50s and i was born
[2:41:52] in the 60s so she was born a whole
[2:41:53] generation before i was
[2:41:55] but she's only from november to january
[2:41:57] older than me but now she's
[2:41:59] older than me right now so we can talk
[2:42:00] about it but we grew up in this church
[2:42:02] and it was a little bitty church and
[2:42:04] and to see this and and the
[2:42:06] participation and the
[2:42:07] and to hear michael sing and lord you
[2:42:10] probably couldn't
[2:42:11] even get him to talk when he first when
[2:42:13] they first started coming to church here
[2:42:14] you know and you got
[2:42:15] michael singing and they got all the new
[2:42:17] ones coming in and
[2:42:19] and i want to take a just a thought for
[2:42:21] just a second we've lost some
[2:42:23] uh this year you know brother um
[2:42:27] dale roberts and um
[2:42:31] sister and um your mom
[2:42:34] then we lost um
[2:42:38] dick addison and then we lost esther
[2:42:41] lost her dad
[2:42:42] this year also so it's it's tough
[2:42:46] but we're one day closer to home we
[2:42:49] don't have to look at 20 20 no more
[2:42:52] it's 20 21. we we looking forward
[2:42:55] all right man so let's read this in
[2:42:58] corinthians and

[2:44:04] cup and when he had stopped saying this
[2:44:06] cup is the new testament
[2:44:08] in my blood this duty as often as you
[2:44:10] drink it in remembrance of me
[2:44:12] for as often as you eat this bread and
[2:44:14] drink this cup you do show the lord's
[2:44:16] death till he comes you know the old
[2:44:19] saying is is what you're doing
[2:44:21] the first day of the year is what you do

[2:44:36] and let's let's let's get out of here
[2:44:39] amen
[2:44:40] because jesus said he wasn't going to
[2:44:42] drink or eat until we come back
[2:44:44] he's going to eat it with us he thought
[2:44:46] so much of us brother william he's
[2:44:48] he's not going to eat or drink any of
[2:44:50] this until he does it with me and you
[2:44:52] he was looking forward when he picked
[2:44:54] that cup up he was looking at the people
[2:44:56] in the
[2:44:56] upper room but he was looking at a bride
[2:44:59] that was inside of him but like you said
[2:45:02] now
[2:45:02] he's in the bride and we are partaking
[2:45:05] of what he has said right here for as
[2:45:07] often as you eat this bread and drink
[2:45:08] this cup you do show the lord's death
[2:45:10] till he comes
[2:45:11] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:45:13] and drink this cup of the lord
[2:45:14] unworthily
[2:45:15] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[2:45:17] the lord
[2:45:18] but let a man examine himself and so let
[2:45:21] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[2:45:22] cup
[2:45:23] for he that he didn't drinketh
[2:45:24] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[2:45:26] to himself not discerning the lord's
[2:45:28] body
[2:45:29] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[2:45:31] among you in many sleep
[2:45:33] for if we would judge ourselves we
[2:45:35] should not be judged
[2:45:37] but when we are judged we are chastened
[2:45:39] of the lord that we should not be
[2:45:40] condemned with the world thank god for
[2:45:41] that
[2:45:42] wherefore my brethren when you come
[2:45:44] together to eat terry one for another
[2:45:46] and if any man hunger let him meet at
[2:45:47] home that you come not together into
[2:45:50] condemnation and the rest will i set an
[2:45:51] order
[2:45:52] when i come let's just take a few
[2:45:54] moments of silent prayer terry
[2:45:56] prophet of god said pray for your pastor
[2:46:10] lord we ask you just bless the lord the
[2:46:13] ones in this building the ones lord on
[2:46:14] the internet
[2:46:16] the little bride all around the world
[2:46:17] lord we pray that you would touch each
[2:46:19] one and that this year would be a true
[2:46:20] communion lord closer to you father
[2:46:23] we ask these things in jesus name amen
[2:46:27] the bible said he took the bread blessed
[2:46:28] it dear heavenly father we ask you to
[2:46:30] bless this bread lord
[2:46:31] i just made my holy hands lord it's not
[2:46:34] made with any extra ingredients
[2:46:36] lord but it's your body and it was
[2:46:37] broken for us lord this due in
[2:46:38] remembrance lord of you father
[2:46:40] yes we take this lord and we ask you to
[2:46:42] sanctify it in jesus name amen
[2:47:09] just think 50 years
[2:47:14] i was 11 years old terence was about
[2:47:18] i was born yes you were 1964.
[2:47:22] um anna was not anna was roaming around
[2:47:24] in the loins of abraham over here
[2:47:28] but just think how we've come this far
[2:47:29] though
[2:47:31] and not just our natural family but
[2:47:34] church families all come together and
[2:47:35] we just consider everybody one and we
[2:47:38] don't
[2:47:39] uh that's right we know i like what
[2:47:41] brother claude always says he says
[2:47:43] there's no great ones among us that's
[2:47:45] right there's no great ones no big eyes
[2:47:47] no little use
[2:47:48] we have offices that we have to go that
[2:47:50] we have to do right but other than that
[2:47:52] we're all human beings
[2:47:53] trying to live a good human life like
[2:47:55] you said and let the lord direct us into
[2:47:57] what we do
[2:47:58] amen let's bow our heads heavenly father
[2:48:01] we ask you lord to bless this wine
[2:48:04] lord he gets better with age and father
[2:48:05] we pray lord that the word of god this
[2:48:07] year
[2:48:08] will truly get better with age lord
[2:48:10] we've all come up to
[2:48:12] to a time now lord where we're all
[2:48:13] getting physically older but i pray lord
[2:48:15] that we'll grow up in you and that
[2:48:17] statue of a perfect man this year lord
[2:48:19] that will not be children running to and
[2:48:21] fro lord
[2:48:22] as the bible says lord but we'll be able
[2:48:25] to eat strong meatloaf
[2:48:27] that this that this thing will culminate
[2:48:29] lord and a bride that'll stand on our
[2:48:30] feet
[2:48:31] and have the word of god to speak
[2:48:32] through her mouth father we ask
[2:48:35] lord the power of this wine lord as we
[2:48:36] for take it lord that it'll just take
[2:48:38] and sanctify each one of us in jesus
[2:48:40] name
[2:48:41] amen amen
[2:48:46] you know as they're as they're giving
[2:48:47] out the
[2:48:49] communion it's uh
[2:48:53] it's been a privilege to stand in front
[2:48:57] of y'all this year
[2:48:59] from my perspective it's it's just it's
[2:49:01] been wonderful to see the young people
[2:49:03] grow
[2:49:04] see brother zach go from
[2:49:08] disappearing to sitting on the front row
[2:49:10] that's why i did i disappeared for a
[2:49:12] while
[2:49:13] and you know you can only run so far
[2:49:16] if you're a child to god heal he's he's
[2:49:18] got the hook in you
[2:49:19] you just don't know it so but to see the
[2:49:22] young people
[2:49:24] um like the song that i asked sister
[2:49:27] trudy we heard that
[2:49:28] i heard that song and i don't want you
[2:49:31] to i don't want to get brow beat up here
[2:49:33] but
[2:49:34] contemporary songs are not bad i like
[2:49:36] southern gospel but
[2:49:37] like that song you think you re you look
[2:49:40] at
[2:49:40] the words the words of that song he
[2:49:43] turns graves into gardens
[2:49:45] there's not a human being can do that
[2:49:47] that's right
[2:49:49] no human can take a grave and make a
[2:49:51] garden out of it
[2:49:53] there's no human can take a sea and make
[2:49:55] a highway
[2:49:56] like you did with the red sea there's no
[2:49:58] man can't do that
[2:50:01] man might be able to burrow under it but
[2:50:03] they're not going to be able to part it
[2:50:04] and make it where two million people can
[2:50:06] walk across on dry land
[2:50:08] amen only god can do that he's the only
[2:50:11] one that can do it
[2:50:12] but his brother william said though he
[2:50:14] uses instruments
[2:50:16] he is now in human flesh and abroad
[2:50:21] and he can turn graves in the garden
[2:50:24] and take bones can these dry bones live
[2:50:28] only one man can make them live
[2:50:30] but that man is not in heaven that's
[2:50:32] right that man standing inside of you
[2:50:34] today
[2:50:35] and like i told them brother whether the
[2:50:37] other day i said we you know we don't
[2:50:38] know what's going on next year nobody
[2:50:40] nobody knows the world is just
[2:50:42] mystified but the one inside of you does
[2:50:45] know what's going to happen next year
[2:50:48] let it speak let that thing out
[2:50:52] and let it do its work glory listen to
[2:50:54] that
[2:50:55] inner man don't worry about all like you
[2:50:57] said don't worry about dr so-and-so we
[2:50:59] we talked to dr jesus
[2:51:01] and we we use his prescription book the
[2:51:03] gospel amen
[2:51:04] you know we don't take no pill but the
[2:51:16] gospel
[2:51:28] i remember daddy used to make he still
[2:51:29] makes wine for the church this is
[2:51:31] his this is his wine but when we were
[2:51:34] first
[2:51:35] uh in 71 and on today you know
[2:51:39] it may be about quarter year
[2:51:42] now he makes about a gallon every three
[2:51:44] months because we take communion you
[2:51:45] know every month but we have a lot of
[2:51:47] people take communion so
[2:51:48] god bless you hope you all have a
[2:51:50] wonderful year
[2:51:51] i know we've missed some but you know
[2:51:54] what we're going to see them again
[2:51:56] and they're in much better shape than we
[2:51:58] are we're just parted just for a little
[2:52:00] while
[2:52:02] but they're there they're more real than
[2:52:05] we are
[2:52:07] we just got they're more real than we
[2:52:09] are
[2:52:10] and i hope that god lets him look over
[2:52:12] the portal every once in a while and
[2:52:13] look down and say
[2:52:14] come on bride come on bride we want to
[2:52:17] do this
[2:52:18] with you we want to do this with you
[2:52:22] here
[2:52:23] because this is our possession let's
[2:52:24] take our communion
[2:52:28] [Applause]
