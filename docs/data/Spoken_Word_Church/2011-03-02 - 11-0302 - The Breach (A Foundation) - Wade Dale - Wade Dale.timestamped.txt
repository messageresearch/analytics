[5:17] lost souls father we're looking Lord to

[5:49] over and you speak Lord as you want to
[5:52] speak in Jesus name we pray amen
[5:55] Zechariah Chapter 4 this is going to be
[5:57] a little little bit different
[6:00] uh we're going to speak we're we're um
[6:03] downstairs we're in the Sunday school
[6:05] class we're going through the seals but
[6:08] we're going to we started in the breach
[6:10] about a month
[6:11] ago and I believe the breach was put
[6:14] where it was put for a foundation so
[6:18] we're going to speak on the breach a
[6:21] foundation now we know God in Simplicity
[6:23] was the first
[6:25] message God is getting the people to
[6:28] realize something something the greatest
[6:30] week known to man since Jesus Christ was
[6:33] buried or or killed and buried and rose
[6:36] again was a greatest week week when that
[6:39] Prophet broke those SEALS or actually
[6:41] when the lamb came down and broke the
[6:43] seals and delivered them to his people
[6:45] so let's read Zechariah
[6:48] 4 verse 6 then he answered and spake
[6:51] unto me saying this is the word of the
[6:53] Lord unto zerubabel zerubabel means a
[6:56] prince With God all right saying not by
[6:59] might not by power but by my spirit
[7:02] saith the Lord of hosts so it's not a
[7:04] man's spirit it's the holy spirit amen
[7:06] spirit of God who art thou oh great
[7:08] Mountain before
[7:11] zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and
[7:13] he shall bring forth The Headstone
[7:15] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[7:17] Grace unto it moreover the word of the
[7:19] Lord came unto me saying the hands of
[7:21] zerubabel have laid the foundations of
[7:23] this house now remember zerubabel was a
[7:26] person he was a captain he came in and
[7:30] actually laid the foundation for the
[7:32] temple so this is not some fictitious
[7:34] character it's a character in the Old
[7:36] Testament that was real and he came and
[7:39] he built that Foundation but listen the
[7:41] hands of jeral have laid the foundation
[7:43] of this house right makes it
[7:46] personal his hands shall also finish it
[7:51] and thou shalt know that the Lord of
[7:52] hosts hath sent me unto you amen for who
[7:56] hath despised the day of small things
[7:57] for they shall rejoice and shall see the
[7:59] plummet now plummet is used by
[8:02] Carpenters it's lead fastened to a line
[8:04] to do what make something
[8:06] straight all right so now what is the
[8:09] prophet doing in the breach he's laying
[8:11] something straight for us all right you
[8:13] got to have a foundation before you can
[8:15] build and shall see the plummet in the
[8:17] hand of zerubba with those seven in
[8:19] other words he had to come back and line
[8:21] everything up with those seven they are
[8:23] the eyes of the Lord which run to and
[8:25] fro through the whole earth you may be
[8:27] seated the Lord add his Blessing to the
[8:29] the word if you would turn to
[8:30] Revelations chap 5 CU that's where we're
[8:33] going to be speaking from
[8:36] tonight so here we've got zerubabel
[8:39] building a house now anybody knows that
[8:43] human beings have to be
[8:46] led Christians have to be led because we
[8:50] are sheep all right but as being human
[8:53] beings God knows how we think because he
[8:56] was once a human being walking on the
[8:58] Earth himself and actually he is the one
[9:02] that wrote this so he knew it before the
[9:05] foundation of the world how it was going
[9:06] to happen he just came down and made it
[9:08] happen all right so in Revelations chap
[9:11] 5 we're going to see that I looked up
[9:14] the word breach the word breach has a
[9:17] has a meaning that maybe not so much as
[9:21] what we would think because we always
[9:23] say Well it it it's a it's the gap
[9:25] between you know the the church ages and
[9:28] and the seals there was a gap in there
[9:30] you know but U excuse me the Hebrew
[9:33] lexican the word breach means bursting
[9:37] forth Outburst right break open break
[9:43] through burst
[9:45] forth you've heard of the word called a
[9:48] breach of
[9:49] security what does that mean someone has
[9:52] broke something open an Open Door there
[9:55] was something sealed cuz when you when
[9:57] something's secure it's sealed up right
[9:59] right there was a breach of security
[10:01] somebody broke that seal and broke into
[10:04] something all right now the prophet of
[10:07] God was not a thief he wasn't breaking
[10:08] in to steal something he was breaking in
[10:10] to give us a revelation Glory all right
[10:12] so now in Revelations five to begin the
[10:16] seals you're not going to just start
[10:20] like we would normally think would be
[10:22] start with seal number one SE number two
[10:24] brother Rand preached God and implicity
[10:26] I'm laying a background here because you
[10:28] and I
[10:30] are
[10:32] humans we do things one two three you
[10:36] say no yes you
[10:38] do everybody knows
[10:41] today the first thing you're going to do
[10:42] in the
[10:44] morning you're going to get up and turn
[10:46] the alarm clock off you're going to go
[10:48] in the bathroom get all your stuff ready
[10:50] and go to work some of you that are Reet
[10:54] retired um don't have to do that right
[10:58] praise the Lord dick brother dick was
[10:59] shaking his
[11:02] head but the first thing you do you know
[11:05] what you're going to do there's a ritual
[11:07] you get up every morning do the same
[11:08] thing we're creatures of what habit all
[11:10] right so in being creatures of habit
[11:13] let's apply that to what brother Brandon
[11:15] was talking about in the seals because
[11:18] we realized this was not a man doing
[11:20] this this was God bringing this to us
[11:24] all right he had to bring it through a
[11:25] man zerubabel had to build a house but
[11:28] it was God working through that man to
[11:31] build a house all right so now he's
[11:34] starting with God in Simplicity showing
[11:36] that it's going to be simple but when he
[11:38] comes to the breach he's laying a
[11:41] foundation because he's coming out he
[11:43] preached the church ages and he saw that
[11:45] the church ages had ended in in in his
[11:48] Revelation he saw that now we're still
[11:50] living in the seven Church ages right so
[11:52] don't get me wrong don't get me in some
[11:54] doctrine that we're already passed that
[11:55] and in the Millennium no we are
[11:57] physically in the seventh Church Church
[11:59] age right we act like lay out
[12:02] of we drove a lay out of car
[12:07] right we got a new layot ofing honey
[12:10] well um thingy over there on the
[12:14] wall I don't see no wires cut off of
[12:17] it so when it's hot we're going to cool
[12:20] it down when it's cold we're going to
[12:21] warm it up so we're all still in the
[12:23] leosan age and we still have leosan
[12:26] habits all right but the Bri is called
[12:29] out of that age all right so here
[12:32] brother brandham is starting and he's
[12:34] bringing up
[12:36] to a point what God is wanting to lay a
[12:40] foundation so that he can break that
[12:42] first seal yeah right if not he wouldn't
[12:46] all right so in Revelations chap
[12:49] 5 we see that God has done something but
[12:52] now watch what God done to a prophet to
[12:57] start this thing and it's very simple
[12:59] but I'm going to read out of out of the
[13:00] seal book on page 60 out of this this
[13:04] book which I'm going to give you the
[13:05] paragraph number and since we're doing
[13:08] this downstairs we're just kind of going
[13:09] to run right along with it because I
[13:13] believe it's helpful and I believe it's
[13:16] something that if that was a foundation
[13:17] for us to work off of then the
[13:20] foundation never goes away right you
[13:23] still build on that same Foundation
[13:26] brother Brandman number in page 60 which
[13:28] is the breach but it's we're going to
[13:31] I'm going to quote the paragraph numbers
[13:33] in case somebody wants to follow with me
[13:36] the paragraph numbers are always the
[13:38] same uh in the old books they they vary
[13:42] by Pages all right but in the uh breach
[13:46] paragraph 11 now watch what God's doing
[13:48] God is showing a prophet something I
[13:50] want to just get this out of the way
[13:52] because you and I must have an
[13:55] experience with God but these seals can
[13:59] open to us there's a foundation that's
[14:02] got to be laid right that we got to not
[14:05] jump above that Foundation right we got
[14:07] to start on that foundation and we got
[14:10] to make sure that Foundation is solid
[14:13] right that it's not a foundation that'll
[14:15] go away not built on shifting sand ver
[14:19] in number 11 now here's a prophet he
[14:22] this is what he's saying before he
[14:24] begins to preach the
[14:26] breach he says I was standing there in
[14:28] prayer and something happened now
[14:30] something fell in my hand and I know if
[14:33] you don't understand spiritual things it
[14:35] may seem very strange but Str something
[14:37] struck my hand and when I looked it was
[14:40] a sword now everybody remembers we went
[14:42] through the story but now remember you
[14:44] going down a little bit further he's
[14:46] describing the sword but here is the
[14:50] key not even that it was just the king
[14:53] sword but he said it just fit my hand
[14:57] amen exactly
[15:00] right it was just like it was already
[15:02] his right like he'd already used it
[15:05] before cuz he said it fit my hand
[15:08] exactly then he said well I wonder and
[15:10] said it meant this is the king sword
[15:12] this is paragraph 13 and said I a king
[15:15] sword and it might have been that I
[15:17] would have understood it but it said the
[15:19] king sword so in other words he's
[15:21] talking about the word but look he goes
[15:23] on remember that's the he's getting the
[15:25] people to try to realize something
[15:27] during the whole week not look to him
[15:30] right but look to God because God was on
[15:32] the scene doing something amen he wanted
[15:34] them to see God was doing something
[15:36] through him and it's not just an
[15:39] experience that he is supposed to take
[15:41] because I'll read you something here in
[15:42] just a second in verse 14 he's talking
[15:45] about then taking that sword and dueling
[15:47] with
[15:49] someone see he goes on a little further
[15:51] it's not just the sword came in his hand
[15:52] and all that fit my hand
[15:55] exactly right he went on to the F on
[15:58] more of the
[16:00] foundation right he said in dueling you
[16:03] see I don't understand the word but one
[16:04] principle of dueling the rest of my
[16:06] understanding the knife striking across
[16:08] and then finally the sword if they lock
[16:10] the enemy and you lock swords like this
[16:12] so it's in other words just like this
[16:14] right all
[16:15] right then it takes the strength of the
[16:18] man dueling see how he going further
[16:22] he's not just talking about oh it' be
[16:23] wonderful just to have a sword no no no
[16:26] he's going further right then it takes
[16:29] the strength of the man dueling because
[16:31] see his sword will be pointed to my
[16:32] heart and mine would be pointed to his
[16:34] that's when they go forward if you ever
[16:36] watch fencing they do the same thing
[16:38] they they lock their their swords
[16:39] together and they're really close to
[16:41] each other's heart but they're locked as
[16:43] our knives strike each other and then
[16:45] they strike and then the swords come
[16:47] together and the one that can shove the
[16:48] other one down the sword is straight to
[16:50] the heart so it takes here's paragraph
[16:53] 15 even though the sword be the
[16:56] word right it takes the hand of strong
[16:59] faith to hold it there to bring it to
[17:02] the heart of the enemy amen all right
[17:04] now and that's what he's explaining now
[17:06] and he goes on and says he does not know
[17:08] what the first seal second and third but
[17:09] you see how God was bringing the people
[17:11] up not to look at him which they did but
[17:14] not to look at him but to see that that
[17:16] he was identifying that the word was a
[17:19] part of his life that he was a part of
[17:21] the word and that God was trying to get
[17:23] that out to the people right all right
[17:26] because remember he preached the church
[17:27] ages and now he's preaching the breach
[17:29] so keep that in mind all right let's go
[17:32] to 64 page 64 but I'll get to the
[17:35] paragraph Just a
[17:37] second Now watch how God
[17:41] is hiding in Simplicity but watch what
[17:44] the prophet says now he's he's speaking
[17:47] of Revelations 10 cuz he's talking about
[17:50] the book he's talking about the book now
[17:52] all right now paragraph 37 now see the
[17:54] mystery of this seven seal book will be
[17:57] revealed at the sounding of of the
[17:58] seventh Church Angel's message see the
[18:01] seventh angel begins to sound and there
[18:04] is the message wrote out here and we got
[18:06] it in tape and book form and he just
[18:09] continues right on with his sermon and
[18:11] never never you hear him on the tape he
[18:13] never even pauses he just continues
[18:15] right on with his thought at the
[18:17] beginning of the sound of the mystery
[18:18] said now we notice the book of mystery
[18:20] of God is Not revealed into the sth
[18:21] Angels message sounded he told him
[18:23] exactly where it was right right did you
[18:26] hear what I said he said there's the
[18:28] Mage wrote out there and we got it in
[18:30] tape and book
[18:32] form God was clearing the foundation off
[18:35] just a little bit more Amen to bring a
[18:38] message through this little man the
[18:41] message of what
[18:43] Redemption all right
[18:45] remember I hope they fix that thing over
[18:47] there I know the on and off button I
[18:49] promise you
[18:50] that Aaron don't have to be here Richard
[18:53] either one cut that
[18:57] cord but listen just for a second just
[19:02] kind of get you I know a lot of you are
[19:04] Fanning but listen to the prophet and
[19:06] we're going to start right here actually
[19:08] we're going to back up to chapter 4 but
[19:10] listen in the breach 1963
[19:13] 317 now now we're going to turn to the
[19:16] fifth chapter now this is not the Seven
[19:18] Seals it is the breach between the
[19:19] church ages and the Seven Seals now what
[19:22] is a breach a breach is breaking open
[19:24] breaking forth all right now there is
[19:27] also a sixth chapter uh there was a
[19:29] fourth chapter rather of Revelations and
[19:31] it in that it kind of re reveals
[19:34] something that would take place after
[19:35] the church going up that's Revelations 4
[19:39] that the church goes up on the third
[19:41] chapter of Revelations and does not
[19:42] return until the 19th Chapter therefore
[19:44] the church misses the tribulation so
[19:47] here turns all you know everybody's like
[19:49] well he's got to come back in
[19:50] Revelations 10 he's got to come back
[19:51] down and reveal this that's where you
[19:53] get your return Ministry from but just
[19:55] really look at this very simple let's
[19:58] just take a
[19:59] minute we know Revelations 1-3 is the
[20:02] church ages
[20:04] correct that's not
[20:07] disputed Revelations 4 the very first
[20:10] verse there's a door open in heaven
[20:12] sister Anna and John hears a voice
[20:15] saying come up hither right in other
[20:17] words he's caught up right all right so
[20:21] now that doesn't end it for
[20:26] us spiritually
[20:28] right but it does end our Earthly
[20:31] Journey
[20:33] naturally and
[20:35] spiritually everybody understand right
[20:38] because what brother Brandon's trying to
[20:40] explain he's explaining that Revelations
[20:42] 4-19 is to a Jewish group of people on
[20:46] the Earth right a natural people because
[20:50] remember this Bible is written I know
[20:53] it's written to Christians but it's also
[20:54] written to the Jews cuz they're fixing
[20:55] to be a Christian right all right so
[20:57] it's written to them too and they
[20:59] literally get the happenings in this
[21:00] book amen all right but you and I get
[21:04] the spiritual application of it so in
[21:06] Revelations 4 let's look at it just run
[21:08] it through your mind just for a minute
[21:10] and if anybody has anything to say about
[21:11] it that's okay but Revelations to me
[21:14] chapter 4 brother Bram says right here
[21:16] he said and there's a fourth chapter
[21:18] rather and in that it kind of reveals
[21:20] something that would take place after
[21:22] the church going up amen see in
[21:24] Revelations 4 1 through 11 the whole
[21:29] chapter is showing us in
[21:32] heaven that we got there
[21:36] right how do you know you said
[21:40] why how do you know
[21:43] that there's one thing I can tell you
[21:46] when you see those combat beefs anywhere
[21:48] you see those combat beefs you see the
[21:50] bride right cuz remember on the fourth
[21:53] seal after the fourth seal what happened
[21:55] in the fifth seal brother Dan he said
[21:57] the Rapture took place cuz those combat
[21:59] beasts are gone right combat beasts are
[22:01] gone so when the combat beasts are gone
[22:03] where are they at they're in the bride
[22:05] so anywhere you see the combat Beast you
[22:06] see the bride right all right so here we
[22:09] see the combat beast in verse 6 of
[22:11] chapter 4 and he showing that the sea of
[22:15] glass remember brother Brown said it was
[22:17] sea of glass that judgment you know
[22:18] brass is Judgment showing judgment's
[22:20] done finished and we're there now in
[22:22] Revelation chap 5 to me God is working
[22:27] in
[22:29] order we're
[22:31] there then he drops back in Revelations
[22:33] 5 and shows us how we got there right
[22:37] right everybody understand that say amen
[22:39] amen okay that shows us how we got there
[22:42] right all right then Revelation 6 shows
[22:46] to the Jews but it shows us a spiritual
[22:49] application which that's we're not going
[22:51] to get into that right now stay in
[22:52] Revelations 5 cuz Revelations 5 to me is
[22:55] a
[22:56] foundation right it's a foundation that
[22:59] if you don't get it right a prophet had
[23:02] to bring the message and had to show it
[23:04] in continuity if not then you got all
[23:08] these doctrines that can't even that
[23:10] don't even they don't even read to me
[23:12] that's just like brother dick said
[23:13] that's just common reading to me that I
[23:15] can read that Revelations 4 that that
[23:19] it's showing us already there cuz if you
[23:21] come if you go up in a Rapture you've
[23:23] made it right but now Revelation 5 is
[23:27] we're going to know how we got there
[23:30] we're going to never forget how we got
[23:32] to heaven
[23:34] right that's going to be to me that's
[23:36] going to be an eternity eternity an
[23:39] eternal opening of how we got there all
[23:42] right so in Revelations 5 though shows a
[23:45] scene of
[23:48] that way that we got
[23:51] there all right so now start out in
[23:54] Revelation chap
[23:56] 5 the brides gone up the glory naturally
[24:00] right right then God goes to the Jews
[24:04] but now in the spiritual application
[24:06] because we got to look at this and see
[24:07] because remember remember what I said
[24:09] about a breach a breach is a breaking
[24:11] open or a breaking forth all right it's
[24:15] a breach of security or a bursting forth
[24:18] something is coming amen something is
[24:20] happening all
[24:22] right but in 41 we're in
[24:25] heaven verse 5 what happens let's start
[24:33] reading and I saw in the right hand of
[24:36] him that sat on the throne a
[24:38] book written within and on the backside
[24:42] sealed with Seven Seals right
[24:45] now that word seals came about
[24:49] there
[24:51] starting the thought process now I'm
[24:53] telling you this is the foundation so so
[24:55] when I get finished with this it's not
[24:57] going to we're not going to some Great
[24:59] opera we're not going to have a great
[25:01] ending here because this is going to
[25:02] continue all right but to get
[25:06] started sealed with Seven Seals now
[25:09] let's look and see in
[25:13] Ephesians what that seal
[25:15] is Ephesians 1 let's go back and just
[25:19] this may be Elementary to all of you
[25:21] and um you know what just let me stir up
[25:25] your mind okay let me just Stir It up
[25:28] and you know I found out one thing for
[25:31] sure at the at the
[25:34] uh Valentine's banquet we need to hear
[25:37] things over and over
[25:39] again cuz a lot of people got their left
[25:42] right and their right left and I told
[25:45] Daddy I said that's why you have to
[25:46] preach 60 something sermons on one thing
[25:48] we don't know our left hand from our
[25:50] right right yeah so in Ephesians 1: 13
[25:53] and whom ye also trusted after that you
[25:56] heard the word of truth of the gospel of
[25:58] your salvation in whom also after you
[26:01] believed what is that building layers
[26:06] right you were sealed with that Holy
[26:10] Spirit of promise if you're born again
[26:11] tonight you're sealed amen if you're
[26:14] born again tonight you are sealed to the
[26:16] day of your Redemption right which is
[26:19] the earnest of our inheritance Earnest
[26:22] down payment first payment on the house
[26:26] not the full payment yet but the first
[26:28] payment right right until the Redemption
[26:31] of the purchased possession right
[26:36] flesh one more time flesh right God
[26:41] wants to dwell in flesh
[26:45] amen unto the praise of his glory now
[26:48] let's go to Ephesians
[26:50] 4 and 30 and grieve not the holy spirit
[26:55] of God whereby ye are sealed right
[27:02] unto something in the future right the
[27:05] day
[27:07] of redemption right all right now let's
[27:12] go back to Revelations
[27:15] 5 so let's keep in our mind that there's
[27:17] one
[27:18] seal amen the Holy Ghost has sealed you
[27:22] until the day of your Redemption exactly
[27:24] all
[27:26] right
[27:28] but I want to ask you a
[27:30] question we read that first
[27:35] verse John's the writer
[27:38] correct John yeah John's writing this he
[27:41] sees it so he's writing
[27:45] it
[27:47] John received the baptism of the Holy
[27:49] Ghost in
[27:53] ad30 right all right if you have a scofi
[27:56] Bible look at your right header note
[28:00] according to Usher Revelations was
[28:02] written in
[28:06] 96
[28:07] John was a born again
[28:11] Christian for 60 years
[28:16] right okay yeah keep that in the back of
[28:19] your mind and I saw a strong Angel
[28:22] proclaimed with a loud voice who is
[28:24] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[28:27] seals thereof that's
[28:29] right verse three and no
[28:32] man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under
[28:35] the Earth was able to open the book
[28:38] neither to look there on right John is a
[28:42] born again believer
[28:44] amen I'm going to keep saying that and I
[28:48] wept much because no man was found wory
[28:51] to open and to read the book right
[28:56] neither to look thereon right John is a
[29:00] born again believer right believes in
[29:04] one God not a Trinity right believes in
[29:07] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[29:09] Jesus
[29:10] Christ amen believes in no eternal
[29:13] hell John is not a Baptist
[29:17] right or a Methodist or a presbyterian
[29:20] or
[29:22] Pentecostal he's a pure Born Again
[29:24] believer in that first church age cuz
[29:26] remember when John left patmas what did
[29:28] he do he went and pastored the church
[29:30] when Paul got his head chopped off he
[29:33] went to Ephesus and pastored the church
[29:34] in Ephesus until he died well my Heavens
[29:37] he was probably if he was 18 which he
[29:39] they said he was a young man when you
[29:41] know he laid on Jesus's bosom and he and
[29:43] he loved Jesus he was probably 18 years
[29:45] old he he's getting up in his 80s
[29:48] already cuz he's 60 years been born
[29:50] again 18 years that make him 78 already
[29:53] sitting on patmas so he was let me let
[29:56] me just put it this way John saw a lot
[29:59] am see I'm trying to bring this and
[30:01] humanize this this
[30:03] Foundation cuz we take when we say
[30:06] sealed everybody
[30:07] goes way up
[30:10] here no you're sealed with the Holy
[30:13] Spirit of promise right that's the seal
[30:17] all
[30:19] right and John is sealed
[30:23] right right amen born again Christian
[30:26] like I said he he don't have a
[30:29] denominational idea right amen he's a
[30:31] pure born again
[30:32] Christian why is he
[30:38] weeping you ever thought about that you
[30:40] said well what well hey he's crying
[30:44] about something right right John is
[30:47] seeing a scene
[30:50] unfold that he really can't comprehend
[30:54] yeah at that
[30:55] moment because remember remember John
[30:59] saw this is another key keep this in the
[31:01] back of your mind especially people in
[31:03] Sunday school
[31:04] class John saw Jesus in a glorified
[31:07] condition right on Earth before he
[31:11] ascended right so when he saw that
[31:14] Bloody lamb he turned and saw that
[31:17] Bloody lamb he saw Jesus
[31:20] amen and something caught him in his
[31:25] spirit and that's a little bit later own
[31:27] but just keep that as a key John
[31:30] saw Jesus go through the bloody lamb
[31:34] part sure the Resurrection The
[31:38] glorification and the Ascension and now
[31:41] here's John back writing he's sitting on
[31:43] patmas he's watching this Vision
[31:47] unfold and he looks and he does not see
[31:51] that
[31:55] man brother Bram said I think 97 and
[31:57] 9998 that in the breach he said
[32:01] everybody was there he even said Elijah
[32:04] Moses all the prophets all the great men
[32:08] when John wept he couldn't see anyone
[32:12] worthy
[32:14] exactly but wait a minute he's born
[32:18] again he's going to heaven yeah he's an
[32:21] eternal creature with God in his soul
[32:25] amen but 78 years old yeah he's dying
[32:31] right
[32:32] right John's having a
[32:35] problem everybody says they got their
[32:38] their you know their dissertation on why
[32:40] he
[32:42] we John couldn't see Jesus cuz remember
[32:46] what brother rown said remember he said
[32:47] the lamb was he said he couldn't see the
[32:49] lamb right cuz he was behind the The
[32:51] Throne we'll get to that in just a
[32:52] second but John is beginning to step in
[32:57] into something the foundation's been
[32:59] laid John is saw everybody in glory
[33:02] verse four in chapter 4 remember John's
[33:04] doing the writing yeah he saw everybody
[33:07] there in four now the vision has dropped
[33:10] back a little ways and he's like well
[33:12] how did they get there without that lamb
[33:15] yeah how did they get there John's born
[33:19] again the Holy Ghost Inside of him
[33:22] saying something's wrong
[33:25] yeah you you're still dying right all
[33:29] these people are already dead the
[33:32] prophets had already died they weren't
[33:34] resurrected but he saw them there in
[33:36] Vision correct all right he even said
[33:39] what brother BR said one time he said
[33:40] those that were dead were there all
[33:43] right but they weren't dead of
[33:46] course but they were there and here's
[33:50] John he's weeping yeah how can this
[33:55] be all right let's read
[33:57] know and back to verse three and no man
[34:00] in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the
[34:02] Earth was able to open the book neither
[34:04] to look there on
[34:06] right excuse me and I wept much because
[34:09] no man was found worthy John was looking
[34:11] for a man sure John wasn't looking for
[34:14] an angel John wasn't looking for some
[34:16] great glorious light he was looking for
[34:19] a man amen he was looking for a man with
[34:21] some skin right he wasn't even looking
[34:24] for he wasn't looking for a ghost or a
[34:26] spirit he was looking for a man
[34:28] right you know why cuz John had an
[34:31] understanding of what happened in the
[34:33] Garden of Eden right he knew what went
[34:35] on he knew what happened and in his mind
[34:39] he knew that that book was not in Adam's
[34:41] hand anymore right all right neither to
[34:44] look there
[34:45] on and one of the elders said unto me
[34:48] weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[34:50] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[34:53] to open the book and to loose the seven
[34:56] SE seals thereof right now here's
[34:59] John listening to an angel a messenger
[35:02] amen someone saying something to
[35:06] him but he hadn't seen him
[35:11] yet okay
[35:14] right we still on the foundation let's
[35:17] don't get off stay on the foundation
[35:18] with
[35:20] me and I be held in low in the midst of
[35:23] the throne the middle right mid his
[35:27] middle in the midst of the
[35:31] throne and of the four Beast
[35:36] right and in the midst of the
[35:39] elders appeared a
[35:41] lamb stood a lamb as it had been slain
[35:44] having seven horns and seven eyes right
[35:46] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[35:48] forth into all the Earth so John is
[35:52] seeing a
[35:53] repeat of Revelation chap 1 right
[35:57] one standing in the middle of the golden
[35:59] candlesticks what G about the P what
[36:01] Bride for him but now John sees this
[36:04] four
[36:05] Beast and the throne and he sees this
[36:08] lamb come
[36:10] forth just like he saw in Revelations 1
[36:14] so here he's got um he's got that same
[36:17] man right in Revelations 1 he looked at
[36:20] him he said oh there's Jesus so I know
[36:22] everything's okay so he goes to rri all
[36:25] right so he goes to right and he writes
[36:27] all the way down through here and he
[36:28] gets to chapter 5 and he don't see that
[36:30] man but now he's come over here a little
[36:32] bit further and he sees that man again
[36:34] same characteristics standing in the
[36:36] midst of the candlesticks you don't have
[36:37] to say candlesticks but what's the seven
[36:39] horns and seven eyes right that's the
[36:41] kingdom the seven Church ages right the
[36:44] kingdom ages Church ages seven horns and
[36:47] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[36:49] of God sent forth into all the Earth so
[36:51] that's where it's going to
[36:53] happen in the church ages
[36:58] God is going to do the work of
[37:00] redemption through the church ages G but
[37:03] if this lamb does not take that book cuz
[37:07] see there's one sitting on the throne
[37:08] with a book in his hand if if if if that
[37:12] person doesn't get that
[37:15] book then the ages are going to just
[37:18] keep dying off yeah John's going to get
[37:21] older right he's going to feel it
[37:23] exactly all
[37:25] right but see in verse 7 and he came and
[37:28] took the book out of the right hand of
[37:30] him that sat upon the throne now like
[37:33] the prophet of God said he said this is
[37:35] a
[37:36] scene and it's not a lamb right a lamb
[37:40] don't have a hand right a lamb can't
[37:42] take a
[37:43] book so it was in symbolic form it was
[37:47] Jesus doing his Redemption work through
[37:49] the ages right so there we see the
[37:53] foundation we see that God has built a
[37:56] found Foundation right Church
[38:00] ages lamb standing in the middle of it
[38:04] there's seven Church age Messengers to
[38:06] those Seven
[38:07] Ages all
[38:09] right but John beheld a
[38:13] lamb and he came and took the book so it
[38:16] had to be a
[38:18] human had to be a
[38:21] person couldn't be a lamb it had to be a
[38:24] person but he was doing the prophet said
[38:26] his mediatorial
[38:29] work and you know
[38:32] really when we talk about
[38:35] that we go back to the word
[38:39] breach
[38:41] because what did job
[38:45] want job come to a place to e just like
[38:50] John he
[38:52] saw a flower go down and come up he saw
[38:56] a tree go down and then leaves would
[38:58] come back up he said but I see
[39:01] man right go down and not come back
[39:05] right so elu had to come and speak to
[39:07] him yeah but he tells them and this is
[39:10] then for for him will I accept in
[39:13] Hamilton Indiana 1952 brother Brown says
[39:15] but yet job there's coming one a just
[39:18] one who will stand in the breach right
[39:21] and put his hands on a sinful man and a
[39:23] holy God and bridged the way stand in
[39:27] his place and make intercession for him
[39:30] then man shall rise again right all
[39:34] right also we see a second type Moses
[39:40] interceded this is in presuming 1962 God
[39:43] Called Moses out said I'm going to
[39:44] destroy the whole nation and see that's
[39:47] what God said to you and I after Adam
[39:50] forfeited that
[39:52] book
[39:53] remember you and I started dying right
[39:57] amen God didn't put a curse on us we
[40:00] cursed ourselves
[40:02] right like d said put we put oursel in
[40:04] the pawn shop all right God called out
[40:08] Moses out and said I'm going to destroy
[40:09] the whole nation just step aside Moses
[40:12] interceded throwing himself in the
[40:15] breach it was Christ in Moses you see
[40:18] God would have killed the whole world
[40:19] one time for sin but Christ throw
[40:22] himself in the breach for the whole
[40:23] human race Moses throw himself in the
[40:25] breach for Israel he said God you made a
[40:31] promise you made a promise that you
[40:33] would take them to the promised land
[40:36] Glory what did Moses do to God when
[40:39] looked like God was going to do
[40:40] something contrary he throwed the word
[40:43] in his
[40:44] way amen oh I love that now I feel like
[40:47] shouting just talking about it put the
[40:49] word in the way God can't walk over his
[40:51] own
[40:53] word John knew something had to happen
[40:57] or mind was going to continue dying good
[41:00] people born again people mind was going
[41:03] to continue to die unless not just
[41:06] remember wait a
[41:08] minute this was a bloody
[41:12] lamb he had died rose
[41:15] again but unless he took the
[41:19] book that Bloody lamb hear me
[41:24] out would do the flesh of
[41:28] man no good
[41:32] right some of his eyebrows are coming
[41:39] together did John did John
[41:41] die did Paul
[41:46] die they had the blood applied to them
[41:49] they accepted the blood amen but they
[41:52] died in flesh right right
[41:57] you see why I want people to understand
[41:59] it's just well you know those seals are
[42:01] it's just something so deep no it really
[42:03] is something that that's that's very
[42:05] simple if you break down the foundation
[42:08] get that Foundation get it good and hard
[42:10] get pack it down
[42:11] good that unless you and
[42:15] I receive the breaking forth of this
[42:19] revelation of this
[42:24] breach that we're going to continue to
[42:26] pass away right true because the blood
[42:30] of Jesus Christ cleanses all sin
[42:34] amen but if we don't accept it for this
[42:38] man right come
[42:41] on that's why John was
[42:44] weeping I'm going to say it again he had
[42:47] been born again for 60 years led by the
[42:51] Holy Ghost for 60
[42:55] years
[42:57] yet he knew something else had to take
[43:01] place does everybody understand that
[43:03] something else had to take place
[43:09] right and you say why is it why are you
[43:12] nailing that down so hard because let me
[43:14] tell you
[43:15] something in this seal
[43:18] book in questions and answers on the
[43:21] seals the prophet I read it to him
[43:25] Sunday of course that's forward a bunch
[43:29] but they didn't ask him but one question
[43:31] about the seals they asked him about
[43:32] wearing blue you know pants to bed and
[43:34] all this stuff like that exactly but
[43:37] brother randam said it's gone from
[43:40] you you're not going to get it and
[43:42] you're not supposed to get
[43:44] it pretty hard to say to a group of
[43:46] people and I don't think they really
[43:48] heard what he said cuz they were
[43:49] shouting about something 5 minutes in
[43:52] the tape later yeah you know I would be
[43:54] going out the door or something my head
[43:56] I'd be down under the Pew or somewhere
[43:59] but what does he tell them to do he says
[44:01] live a good simple Christian Life let
[44:05] your light shine before man you know
[44:07] what he was doing he was saying there's
[44:09] nobody in this whole place is going to
[44:12] get what I'm
[44:14] saying in the fullness of the Revelation
[44:18] nobody you're all going to
[44:22] die brother dick that's what he was
[44:24] saying you didn't get it it's not for
[44:28] you and it's gone from
[44:32] you now folks it's time to look this
[44:34] thing straight in the
[44:36] face but watch what he said in
[44:40] continuation he said he talks about a
[44:44] radio he said there's waves going
[44:47] through this building he said there's
[44:49] radio
[44:50] waves in other words let me paraphrase
[44:52] it he said it takes a certain diamond
[44:56] to pick up a certain
[44:58] Channel you know what he was saying the
[45:01] diamonds wasn't there
[45:05] yet you know what I'm saying the
[45:08] diamonds are here now
[45:11] amen we have begun to dial in that radio
[45:14] you know how the of course a lot of you
[45:16] a lot of you kids are looking at me like
[45:17] I'm an idiot but there's there's
[45:20] something Beyond
[45:21] digital radio yeah used to we have to
[45:25] turn the dial and it was mostly a.m.
[45:29] yeah and if you didn't get it right on
[45:30] the right right it would pop and crack
[45:34] yeah and fade out right right I can
[45:38] remember when radio was an option in a
[45:40] car not just amfm was an
[45:45] option yeah I'm
[45:48] 51 seat belts were not even in a car you
[45:51] know or they were there you just never
[45:52] used them but anyway let's get what he
[45:55] was saying though he he was saying that
[45:57] that the
[45:58] right crystal was not
[46:01] there cuz in the old radio just to
[46:04] explain cuz I got a little time in a
[46:07] radio an old radio there was actually
[46:09] little Diamond crystals
[46:12] Y and Beyond the digital age you used to
[46:15] turn it down it had that little red hand
[46:17] it went across like this and it was on a
[46:19] runner but when you turn that dial and
[46:22] that Crystal run across a certain spot
[46:24] you could pick up that's why it was am55
[46:27] is 55
[46:29] mahz everybody understand that I sound
[46:31] like Aaron Roberts now 55 MHz everybody
[46:34] get this okay but at 55 mahz that
[46:38] diamond was cut a certain way that
[46:41] Crystal was formed a certain way that
[46:43] when that that when that wave come in
[46:46] from that antenna that stuck up all the
[46:47] time we don't have them anymore but that
[46:49] antenna stuck up all the time it comes
[46:51] down and when it comes in the back Danny
[46:53] what' it do it struck that just perfect
[46:57] and you picked up
[46:58] am55 then you had another one at a 650
[47:01] and 750 and you see what I'm saying what
[47:03] brother R why did he use that
[47:06] illustration I don't think he just used
[47:08] common illustrations just to fill up
[47:09] time on a table amen I believe it was a
[47:13] purpose he said there's people going
[47:16] through this room and he said if we had
[47:18] the right
[47:19] receptor if we had the right cut of
[47:23] diamond we could pick them he said we
[47:25] could set a a radio right here and turn
[47:26] it on he was talking about TV but you
[47:28] can set a TV in here turn it on you can
[47:30] pick up that picture what was he telling
[47:32] that group of people brother brand to me
[47:34] was standing like John he was
[47:36] weeping cuz remember he said he said I'm
[47:39] only presuming if God don't come on the
[47:41] scene and open this book right brother
[47:44] Brandon was standing in the same place
[47:46] John was standing in right if something
[47:49] don't happen if that man don't take that
[47:52] book
[47:54] something got to happen
[47:56] happen and he didn't see it right then
[47:59] right cuz right here I'll read you in
[48:01] just a minute he said I don't know what
[48:03] the first seal is I don't know what to
[48:05] say silly he said we're only presuming
[48:06] he said I've been presuming for for down
[48:08] Through the Ages man has been
[48:12] presuming but there was brother Brown
[48:14] he'd been a born again
[48:16] Christian for about 40
[48:19] years when he was breaking when he was
[48:21] standing in his place he was just like
[48:24] John he was
[48:26] weeping but when he turned he sees a
[48:29] lamb
[48:30] Glory but see brother
[48:33] brandham he had
[48:35] the
[48:37] book John didn't have this book right
[48:42] right John I don't know if John knew if
[48:44] that was a Bible or not but I know that
[48:47] brother brandham knew that it was a
[48:49] Bible yeah that that one was sitting on
[48:52] the throne with it in his
[48:54] hand
[48:56] so now here we've got brother brandom in
[48:58] the same place as as John but John in
[49:01] verse 7 the bible says and he came and
[49:03] took the book out of the right hand of
[49:05] him that sat upon the throne he who a
[49:08] man in
[49:10] flesh had to take that
[49:13] book then you'll remember brother randam
[49:16] goes to Revelations
[49:18] 10 and he says the mighty angel came
[49:22] down with the book that was open right
[49:25] right right exactly all right so now to
[49:29] see this scene let's just kind of kind
[49:31] of go forward just a little
[49:34] bit page
[49:38] 97
[49:40] paragraph 290 this is way on in the
[49:43] message but listen to what he's trying
[49:45] to get the people to
[49:47] see now he preached the
[49:51] breach and then he preached the seals to
[49:55] 1 2 3 4 5 he preached number six on
[50:00] Saturday and he was going to preach he
[50:03] preached the U he preached the U
[50:06] questions and answers on Sunday morning
[50:07] and then he preached the seals on Sunday
[50:08] night right so it was on Sundays when he
[50:11] preached the revelation of the seven
[50:12] seal listen to this now watch when he
[50:15] done that watch what taken place you
[50:16] talk about a jubilee now he's talking
[50:18] about when the lamb takes the book now
[50:20] this is exactly the breaking of them
[50:22] seals take place we'll get into the half
[50:24] hour silent just after this watch this
[50:27] and we'll start in we'll finish this up
[50:29] next Sunday night right
[50:33] here everybody understand what I just
[50:36] said he said we'll finish this up finish
[50:40] this up next Sunday right here now what
[50:43] was next Sunday opening of the seventh
[50:46] seal right amen when all creation what
[50:50] took place when he did this in other
[50:52] words when he took the book so you see
[50:55] what did he
[50:56] do he took him right back to the
[50:59] foundation
[51:01] right the seventh seal wasn't something
[51:03] that went way out into history yeah
[51:05] right he took that seven seal and said
[51:07] we're going to come right back here to
[51:09] what
[51:11] Redemption when the lamb takes that
[51:14] book when he takes that book and what
[51:16] does he do he doesn't just hold on to
[51:18] the book he opens it right and when he
[51:21] opens it what does that mean you and I
[51:23] can look inside of it right right you
[51:26] and I can see the Revelation that been
[51:28] hid come on because
[51:31] Adam Adam lost that
[51:36] book Adam lost the ability to bring us
[51:39] all forth
[51:41] right
[51:46] right brother Tim he didn't have this
[51:49] book God had this book amen now listen
[51:53] you got to go back to symbols God did
[51:54] not have a literal King James Version
[51:57] Bible in his
[52:00] possession it was The Book of Life
[52:03] Glory Lamb's Book of Life cuz that's the
[52:06] only ones that's considered in
[52:07] Redemption right okay see because
[52:10] remember brother Brown speaks about the
[52:12] book and there sections in the book but
[52:15] this part in Revelations 5 is not
[52:17] talking about a foolish virgin right
[52:20] it's not talking about a cup of water in
[52:21] my name it's talking about it's not
[52:24] talking about just a regular book of
[52:25] life it's talking about the Lamb's Book
[52:28] of Life cuz who took it the lamb if it
[52:31] listen if this is my book and I take it
[52:35] this is Wade's
[52:37] book right when the lamb took that book
[52:40] it was his book amen so it was the
[52:42] Lamb's Book of Life right and who was he
[52:45] slain for everybody but the only the
[52:47] ones he came to get was the ones that
[52:49] was in that book right exactly so John
[52:52] knew that as long as Jesus didn't have
[52:56] this book may I say Jesus is that okay
[52:58] yeah cuz that was the bloody lamb right
[53:01] right all right not wasn't one sitting
[53:04] on the throne and then there's another
[53:05] person sitting out here come on people
[53:08] this is a
[53:09] scene God is on his foundation laying a
[53:13] foundation for us to be able to actually
[53:16] understand what's going to happen
[53:18] through those
[53:20] seals is that not
[53:22] true we got to get the foundation you
[53:24] say just
[53:28] Redemption John was already redeemed
[53:30] yeah right John was redeemed 60 years
[53:33] before this happened amen
[53:35] exactly but he was still dying right he
[53:40] was dead in his flesh right he had
[53:44] probably not saw Paul get killed but he
[53:46] knew Paul was dead yeah the great
[53:49] Apostle Paul was
[53:51] gone he was not there to help in
[53:54] Revelations 5
[53:58] come on people
[54:01] right this scene better happen in our
[54:04] life right
[54:07] exactly amen and amen Foundation sword
[54:11] in a hand it's got to fit you right amen
[54:14] amen the word for the hour has got to
[54:16] fit your hand right
[54:20] foundation then you got to have enough
[54:23] strength to use it
[54:26] that's our problem amen that was John's
[54:30] problem amen he didn't have enough
[54:33] strength to use it and where do we get
[54:36] our
[54:37] strength amen amen right here this is
[54:40] where our strength comes from Glory
[54:43] right here not from gre's Almanac or
[54:45] McDonald's almanac for anybody listening
[54:48] in Jamaica
[54:49] yeah or it doesn't come
[54:54] from don't get me wrong all the preach
[54:57] sermons that we hear oh
[55:01] my and the Pastor said amen right
[55:05] amen it comes from what you
[55:08] got now that's the vehicle we get it
[55:12] from but it's got to come from
[55:15] you John typed the entire
[55:20] bride so if you don't
[55:23] see this
[55:27] not in the bloody Lamb's hand because
[55:30] where is the bloody lamb tonight yeah
[55:32] amen come on he's inside of you
[55:35] right so
[55:37] you who was that Bloody lamb that took
[55:42] the book yeah from the hand of the owner
[55:45] which was God Almighty
[55:48] himself son of
[55:49] man a man in human flesh right that was
[55:54] God not God sitting here you can't
[55:57] explain it by natural explanation
[55:59] exactly but I know Brother Dean and I
[56:01] talked about this a long time ago Lord
[56:03] Mercy you know 10 years ago when I first
[56:05] come back to the Lord you got to really
[56:08] you can't
[56:09] just see a you got to really be able to
[56:12] be there come on you got to really be
[56:15] able to be in that exactly in that
[56:18] Vision cuz if you look off somewhere
[56:21] that's just a story right that's a story
[56:25] being told right about brother dick
[56:27] Addison that's a song
[56:30] leader but if I become dick Addison
[56:34] right I don't have to ask questions
[56:36] about Dick Addison I've become dick
[56:39] Addison right right if I'm asking
[56:42] questions about Jesus Christ if I'm
[56:44] wondering about things guess what just
[56:47] become
[56:48] him like I said many times
[56:51] before somebody writes a book if some
[56:54] somebody writes a book and it's a
[56:56] wonderful book you can read that book
[56:58] and you're just an an
[57:01] onlooker John was an onlooker when he
[57:04] started weeping right John was looking
[57:07] at a SC right but see in my Revelation
[57:10] this is my
[57:12] part John sees that lamb come around
[57:15] from behind the throne right and take
[57:18] that book exactly something strikes
[57:20] John's
[57:21] heart he says that's my lord and savior
[57:24] he amen and amen he said although even
[57:27] though I'm born again right here inside
[57:30] there's something
[57:32] missing but now John as the literal
[57:34] person listen cuz he typed the bride but
[57:37] John as the literal person did not make
[57:39] a body change right but he saw that man
[57:42] in that scene take that book and when he
[57:46] took that
[57:49] book if John would have made it to the
[57:51] change John would have become that man
[57:54] right
[57:55] is that too much
[57:57] no if not it's a second person come on
[58:00] brother right say we got to read this
[58:04] Bible closer than we're reading it right
[58:06] amen amen because when I read a love
[58:09] letter about when June or I'm gone
[58:11] somewhere and I read a love letter it's
[58:13] like she's not sitting beside me she's
[58:16] me she's right here and I know exactly
[58:19] what she's thinking why' the prophet say
[58:21] that he never said he said no I I I can
[58:24] just feel her beside me no he said I
[58:26] know what she's thinking in her heart
[58:28] right not her in her heart her being
[58:33] right so when John saw that man take
[58:35] that book he said there's my
[58:37] savior now he has the complete
[58:41] plan and John this is just the way I see
[58:44] it John comes right over into that
[58:48] Vision because what does he do he has a
[58:51] shouting fit right but now even though
[58:55] John didn't make it now don't get me
[58:56] wrong John didn't take a body chain but
[58:58] he's typing the bride that will right
[59:01] right he's typing he he's come into that
[59:04] vision and he's not an onlooker anymore
[59:06] John wept because he couldn't what see a
[59:09] man amen but when he saw that man take
[59:12] that book I believe John just entered
[59:15] right into that Vision glory and John
[59:19] said let's read
[59:21] it and when he had taken the book
[59:26] the four Beast and the 4 and2 Elders
[59:28] fell down before the lamb having every
[59:30] one of them Harps and golden vs full of
[59:32] odors which are the prayers of the
[59:34] Saints and they sung a new song saying
[59:37] thou are worthy to take the book and to
[59:39] open the seals thereof for thou what
[59:40] slain and has redeemed us to God by thy
[59:43] blood out of every Kindred and tongue
[59:45] and people and nation and has made us
[59:47] unto our God Kei Kings and Priests and
[59:50] we shall reign on the
[59:52] Earth was there anything in there that
[59:55] said
[59:57] I because remember John is going I saw I
[1:00:02] I there's no more eyes
[1:00:05] yeah it's us right they right we right
[1:00:10] amen do you see what I'm talking about
[1:00:12] people we can't be an onlooker right
[1:00:16] we've got to be an active
[1:00:19] participant John was then not an
[1:00:22] onlooker he was an active par but and
[1:00:25] brother B said when he saw that said he
[1:00:27] shouted yeah and he said he shouted and
[1:00:30] I didn't bring it I was going to look it
[1:00:31] up but he said he shouted and shouted
[1:00:34] and shouted said he even looked and the
[1:00:36] vision broke and he actually saw his
[1:00:38] name wrote In the book right and that
[1:00:40] what he said saw his name wrote In the
[1:00:43] book now buddy let me tell you
[1:00:46] something John
[1:00:48] died but John Top's a bride can I say it
[1:00:51] again yeah John died but John topes a
[1:00:54] bride
[1:00:55] when the bride realizes who she is right
[1:00:59] and where she's at on and the position
[1:01:01] John saw position right let me tell you
[1:01:04] something folks if you ever see your
[1:01:05] name wrote in a book come on you can
[1:01:07] forget about everything else right right
[1:01:09] amen that's what I was telling the
[1:01:10] people downstairs I said look I
[1:01:13] said when that change happens we'll be
[1:01:18] finished
[1:01:19] here when that change comes the Bible
[1:01:23] says we which are alive and remain
[1:01:26] that's right to the coming of the Lord
[1:01:28] shall not hinder or prevent that's right
[1:01:30] those who are dead amen now folks let me
[1:01:33] tell you something it's going to take
[1:01:34] somebody alive to call those people out
[1:01:35] of the Grave I believe that it's going
[1:01:38] to take somebody alive to call those
[1:01:39] people out of the Grave right now folks
[1:01:42] let me tell you
[1:01:43] something they're already in their
[1:01:45] glorified body on if you have enough
[1:01:48] power come on that's it I'm not saying
[1:01:50] you but what's inside of you has enough
[1:01:53] power that's it to pull those people out
[1:01:55] of that grave and put them in a
[1:01:57] glorified
[1:01:58] condition let me tell you something
[1:02:00] folks death come up your sleeve death
[1:02:04] come on there's no way it's going to
[1:02:06] harm you there's no way it's going to
[1:02:08] harm you when you see those people and
[1:02:11] what the power of your speech come on
[1:02:14] Amen but let me give you another part of
[1:02:16] this story we're still in sinful bodies
[1:02:19] when that happens right come on we're
[1:02:23] still in sinful bodies when that happens
[1:02:25] when we call the dead out of the ground
[1:02:26] cuz the Bible says we which are alive
[1:02:28] and remain shall not prevent or hinder
[1:02:31] those which are asleep that's right for
[1:02:33] the trumpet of God shall sound the dead
[1:02:35] in Christ shall rise first and they
[1:02:38] shall be changed then we shall be
[1:02:40] changed but it's going to be what you
[1:02:42] say that changes them before you even
[1:02:45] get changed so it's the power of what
[1:02:47] you have
[1:02:49] inside exactly so
[1:02:52] John entered in
[1:02:56] and become one with the vision
[1:02:58] amen everybody understand that cuz John
[1:03:01] was here John was like and I saw in the
[1:03:03] right hand of him and verse two and I
[1:03:05] saw and I
[1:03:09] wept but from verse
[1:03:14] 8 it ain't I no more
[1:03:17] right it's a group of people
[1:03:20] amen
[1:03:22] they when he took the book the four and
[1:03:25] four beasts yeah four and 20 Elders fell
[1:03:27] down before the lamb having everyone you
[1:03:29] know this doesn't say in the Bible that
[1:03:30] John did that that John screamed but
[1:03:32] brother BR said John
[1:03:34] screamed and started shouting right he
[1:03:38] must have been part of that
[1:03:40] group so he wasn't looking anymore he
[1:03:45] know he wasn't looking at anymore he was
[1:03:48] an active participant in what was going
[1:03:50] on so let me tell you something right
[1:03:53] here close the book
[1:03:55] had a few more things to say but I'm not
[1:03:57] going to say
[1:03:59] them listen to
[1:04:03] this you and
[1:04:05] I are now the
[1:04:09] crystals that's going to take this thing
[1:04:11] to a change exactly you and I have
[1:04:15] become God has tooken shave those
[1:04:18] crystals down that's what they do with
[1:04:20] diamonds right
[1:04:22] yeah and brought up
[1:04:26] people because
[1:04:28] look get this if you don't get anything
[1:04:32] else John typed the bride here we go
[1:04:34] again John was born again Christian for
[1:04:36] 60 years but John did not have a
[1:04:39] complete Revelation because Revelations
[1:04:42] 10:7 had not come to
[1:04:45] pass right but now folks Revelations
[1:04:48] 10:7 has come to
[1:04:51] pass right
[1:04:55] the
[1:04:56] tuner has tuned the dial
[1:04:59] right to the right receptor to the right
[1:05:02] to the right
[1:05:04] crystal those crystals weren't even in
[1:05:06] the radio when brother random was
[1:05:08] preaching this but he knew there was a
[1:05:11] group coming yeah that would accept this
[1:05:14] I believe that and would not be because
[1:05:17] even brother like I said brother
[1:05:18] brandham brother brandham would in his
[1:05:21] in his person was weeping don't tell me
[1:05:23] you was how can you preach to thousands
[1:05:26] of people and they and and God said
[1:05:29] right there's not a one them
[1:05:31] understanding what you're saying right
[1:05:33] wouldn't That Make You Weep yeah because
[1:05:36] what he saw this he saw a
[1:05:40] vision of a group of people right that
[1:05:43] was coming glory and they had not met
[1:05:48] yet but in the days of
[1:05:52] the right not the person not the man the
[1:05:57] days of the voice right of the seventh
[1:06:00] angel when he begins to
[1:06:02] sound that mystery that everybody was
[1:06:04] looking at that's right was finished
[1:06:08] amen when brother random preached the
[1:06:10] seventh seal then he brought them right
[1:06:12] back to Revelations 5 do you know he
[1:06:14] never read that scripture in the whole
[1:06:16] he said we going to come back right here
[1:06:17] next Sunday night he never read that
[1:06:19] scripture but he brought the two
[1:06:22] together right he brought the
[1:06:25] bride and he brought that Vision that
[1:06:28] John had in Revelations 5 of full
[1:06:31] Redemption Body Spirit and soul he
[1:06:33] brought them together
[1:06:35] amen now it didn't happen for him but he
[1:06:38] saw you hear what I said he saw right
[1:06:40] because he said in the days The Voice
[1:06:41] exactly of the seventh angel when he
[1:06:43] shall begin to sound in other words
[1:06:45] you're going to become
[1:06:47] one with the mystery right most people
[1:06:51] think a mystery is something out here
[1:06:55] the greatest mystery go back to God in
[1:06:58] Simplicity is that God took a little man
[1:07:00] from
[1:07:02] Kentucky took him up the statue of a
[1:07:04] perfect man laid a foundation for the
[1:07:07] seals to be open and then through that
[1:07:10] little man through that whole week
[1:07:13] brought to Revelation
[1:07:15] right and then then what did he do he
[1:07:18] basically sealed it back
[1:07:21] up oh sure it was out there the boy
[1:07:24] you know I mean the message hadn't
[1:07:26] changed he didn't come back and preach
[1:07:27] anything else and he's not going to come
[1:07:29] back and preach anything else but what
[1:07:31] he preached was not
[1:07:34] understood cu the little crystals
[1:07:36] weren't
[1:07:37] here Gary
[1:07:40] Atkins wasn't here yet
[1:07:43] right dick Addison was still in the
[1:07:45] Presbyterian
[1:07:49] Church I was a
[1:07:52] baby
[1:07:55] I was a baby you still some of you
[1:07:58] weren't even
[1:08:00] born but listen God didn't lose you he
[1:08:05] knew you'd be right here
[1:08:06] right but we were out doing all things
[1:08:09] while this word was being made known but
[1:08:11] do you think he forgot
[1:08:13] nope cuz you were the
[1:08:16] receptor that he was looking for when I
[1:08:18] say he and I'm talking about brother
[1:08:19] brand I'm talking about God God was
[1:08:21] looking for somebody to accept that
[1:08:23] message
[1:08:25] but when he brought
[1:08:26] it you and I weren't there so guess what
[1:08:30] we're here
[1:08:32] amen let's take this now as a foundation
[1:08:35] glory and let's move on thank you Lord
[1:08:41] okay we've got to become one with this
[1:08:43] thing people amen amen we cannot be an
[1:08:46] active partic I mean we can't be an
[1:08:47] onlooker we got to be an active
[1:08:49] participant thank you Lord we've got to
[1:08:52] be able to not quote every
[1:08:55] quote not not know every mystery to say
[1:08:59] well boy I know this from here to here
[1:09:02] no but our calling is not just to live a
[1:09:06] good Christian Life
[1:09:07] Now L's stand it's not
[1:09:11] people I know it's I know that's that's
[1:09:14] 100% of it but it's not all of it right
[1:09:17] you live a good Christian Life you'll do
[1:09:19] like John right you'll die right amen
[1:09:24] was John was a born again again
[1:09:25] Christian for how long 60
[1:09:29] years but when John come down to
[1:09:32] Revelations 5 because what happens right
[1:09:34] after Revelations
[1:09:36] 5 God just breaks right out into the
[1:09:39] seal amen it starts breaking one 2 3 4
[1:09:42] all the way down okay so that's what I
[1:09:45] want God to do to each one of us
[1:09:48] right I want us to not not not say well
[1:09:51] I understand c one I understand Seal two
[1:09:55] I got number
[1:09:59] three oh grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:10:02] God whereby you are sealed with Seven
[1:10:04] Seals one right one
[1:10:07] seal but there's seven in
[1:10:11] there that's going to change this whole
[1:10:13] body amen and it's going to make
[1:10:17] it in a glorified
[1:10:21] condition but when you're reading now
[1:10:24] when you're studying pray to God say God
[1:10:27] don't just let me know the message just
[1:10:29] remember last time I when I when I
[1:10:31] ministered I said let's don't let this
[1:10:32] just be a quote let's don't let this
[1:10:35] just be head knowledge right cuz head
[1:10:38] knowledge will take you nowhere but when
[1:10:40] but when John if John was able and type
[1:10:42] the bride and was able to come together
[1:10:44] and be one with that Vision then guess
[1:10:46] what that's for assurity brother Al
[1:10:49] somebody's going to do it right cuz
[1:10:51] remember it's a vision exactly when God
[1:10:53] shows a vision there in Revelations
[1:10:55] remember he sees from the beginning to
[1:10:57] the end he seen all that and it was
[1:11:00] finished because what see brother R have
[1:11:02] a vision he'd have a vision what it
[1:11:05] hadn't even happened yet naturally where
[1:11:09] did that come
[1:11:10] from that had to come straight from the
[1:11:13] mind of God cuz God knew what was going
[1:11:16] to
[1:11:17] happen God just let that Prophet enter
[1:11:20] into that vision and be able to see what
[1:11:22] was going to happen
[1:11:24] and I was telling him
[1:11:25] downstairs not just to see the vision
[1:11:27] but remember he talked about the Hat
[1:11:30] talked about things that had to be in
[1:11:33] place cuz if a hat was laying on a couch
[1:11:36] and he walked in that room and that hat
[1:11:38] was like laying on a TV he said watch
[1:11:43] let me give you this story one one last
[1:11:45] story I was going to do it earlier but
[1:11:46] let me do it
[1:11:48] now watch here's a prophet of God had
[1:11:51] enter had already entered into Vision
[1:11:54] saw what was going to happen right
[1:11:58] exactly but even he said I can't tell
[1:12:01] the people to move it right somebody has
[1:12:07] to walk in here and move that hat that's
[1:12:10] right and he said he sat there with that
[1:12:12] little baby screaming and crying and the
[1:12:15] mother saying brother Brown pray for the
[1:12:17] baby and he said I just sat there why
[1:12:19] the Hat wasn't in the place he saw it at
[1:12:22] the vision but now when whoever the was
[1:12:24] the woman come in she picks the Hat up
[1:12:26] She lays it over on the couch first
[1:12:28] thing he does he steps up he walks right
[1:12:30] over there and he lays his hands on the
[1:12:31] baby and God healed the baby amen you
[1:12:33] say well boy that's
[1:12:35] just that's just
[1:12:38] what that's what God saw and that's what
[1:12:41] had to
[1:12:42] happen but even a prophet of God
[1:12:45] couldn't move that hat right it had to
[1:12:48] be a human being right it had to be
[1:12:50] somebody somebody else right to move
[1:12:53] that that's right right think about that
[1:12:55] on her own right exactly exactly yeah he
[1:12:59] couldn't he couldn't make no suggestions
[1:13:02] he couldn't make no there wouldn't be no
[1:13:04] thought process you know the person just
[1:13:07] naturally walking through life he just
[1:13:09] reached over and moved the hat right and
[1:13:11] then what happened everything clicked
[1:13:14] right and that's what God's waiting on
[1:13:15] Amen he's waiting on for that Vision
[1:13:17] that he saw he wants everybody in their
[1:13:19] place everybody in their position
[1:13:21] everybody doing what they're supposed to
[1:13:22] be doing and then guess what the Rapture
[1:13:24] is going to take place let's sing4 194

[1:18:08] saying is
[1:18:10] though we look at that book and we say
[1:18:12] boy that's a good quote and we underline
[1:18:17] it that means it's out there
[1:18:20] yeah but if we see that
[1:18:23] and it becomes here
[1:18:25] right then it's written

[1:18:34] and I Glory let's bow our
[1:18:38] heads dear heavenly
[1:18:41] father Lord I pray that what we've said
[1:18:43] tonight Lord was pleasing to you
[1:18:45] Lord and I pray Lord that you would just
[1:18:49] go with us be with us fill us with your
[1:18:52] Holy Spirit Lord as the song says keep
[1:18:55] our lamps trimmed and clear Lord that's
[1:18:57] something we have to
[1:18:58] do Lord just take out all the things
[1:19:02] that hinders us Lord all the sin in our
[1:19:05] life and the
[1:19:07] unbelief Lord help us to become this not
[1:19:10] just yes Lord Lord uh looking at
[1:19:13] something and and saying oh that's
[1:19:15] that's too far that's too hard or or
[1:19:19] that's for someone
[1:19:20] else no I I
[1:19:23] the Bible said that the lamb had
[1:19:26] overcome and took the book what a bold
[1:19:30] statement he had overcome he had
[1:19:33] wrestled and
[1:19:34] won and Lord you didn't just be the
[1:19:38] Overcomer yourself but you being the
[1:19:40] first one you gave us an opportunity to
[1:19:43] become
[1:19:44] Overcomers and all down Through the Ages
[1:19:47] you had your Overcomers but Lord in the
[1:19:48] last
[1:19:51] age you made it
[1:19:54] personal father to end it up in
[1:19:57] Revelations
[1:19:59] 3 it says that you are giving us an
[1:20:03] invitation to sit with
[1:20:06] you in your
[1:20:08] throne not on not
[1:20:11] beside but in yes Lord as you overcame
[1:20:16] and set on your father's throne in your
[1:20:18] father's
[1:20:20] Throne Lord that means they become
[1:20:25] one and father that's what our prayer is
[1:20:28] tonight yes Lord that we become so one
[1:20:31] with you Lord till all the hatred and
[1:20:36] Malice and grief and worries of life and
[1:20:39] trouble and heartaches and and things of
[1:20:42] life just fade
[1:20:45] away because Lord you promised there in
[1:20:48] Revelations 5 we see that we're in glory
[1:20:52] and Lord you told us we'd be Kings and
[1:20:54] Priests on this Earth down
[1:20:58] here and Lord I pray that that a little
[1:21:02] bit of that would come to each one of
[1:21:04] our life yes Lord that not wait for over
[1:21:09] there to be Kings and Priests cuz we
[1:21:11] know that's going to happen but Lord you
[1:21:12] gave us you told us to come boldly to
[1:21:14] the throne of
[1:21:16] grace Lord I pray tonight any sickness
[1:21:19] any
[1:21:20] disease nothing is impossible for you
[1:21:24] Lord absolutely nothing is
[1:21:28] impossible Lord you had a man named John
[1:21:31] standing on that island he was old in
[1:21:35] age probably tired and
[1:21:38] weary but oh when he saw you take that
[1:21:41] book yes Lord when he saw you take that
[1:21:45] book and climb up and set down on the
[1:21:49] throne my what a place to be
[1:21:53] I believe John if he had arthritis it
[1:21:55] left him yes if he had anything wrong
[1:21:58] with him being tired and weary I think
[1:22:00] it left him cuz your Prophet said he
[1:22:03] shouted and Heaven heard him and Earth
[1:22:05] heard him and all even the ones Under
[1:22:07] the Sea everybody heard John singing and
[1:22:10] praising God yes Father just I pray just
[1:22:14] give us all a little bit of that and
[1:22:16] especially Brother Dean I pray you'd
[1:22:17] give him a double portion because
[1:22:20] tonight I feel very well so Lord you can
[1:22:23] take my portion and give it to
[1:22:25] him father come down and anoint us Lord
[1:22:29] anoint us for this journey that's what
[1:22:31] it is Lord as tonight we've started on a
[1:22:34] foundation that didn't end it zerubabel
[1:22:38] built the
[1:22:40] temple back to its
[1:22:43] condition and it become a shining glory
[1:22:46] for Israel for many years until they
[1:22:49] began to sin again and you destroyed it
[1:22:52] but but you did say that that same
[1:22:54] zerubabel would come back and build on
[1:22:58] the
[1:22:59] foundation and Lord this time it would
[1:23:02] be a mighty
[1:23:03] mountain and a mighty Mountain that will
[1:23:06] not be torn down yes Lord father I pray
[1:23:08] that you just be with us lead us and
[1:23:10] guide us by your holy spirit thank you
[1:23:12] for coming Among Us Lord in a special
[1:23:15] way sweetness and and humbleness of
[1:23:19] spirit father just go with us now may we
[1:23:22] take the things that's been said and and
[1:23:25] not just take them as Idle Words but
[1:23:28] Lord take them in our heart use them
[1:23:31] take that
[1:23:32] sword now we've got some more
[1:23:34] strength that's what I believe Lord
[1:23:36] every Sunday every Wednesday every time
[1:23:39] we listen to the tape talk about you
[1:23:41] that gives that Mighty hand of Faith
[1:23:43] just a little bit more
[1:23:45] strength because Lord
[1:23:49] nobody has ever took the sword of the
[1:23:53] word and put it through Satan's heart
[1:23:56] except
[1:23:58] you you took the keys of death and hell
[1:24:00] away from him and he's
[1:24:03] powerless and he's a bluff as we'll see
[1:24:05] later on Lord through the
[1:24:08] seals but you hold all the keys Lord
[1:24:11] help us to realize that that that key to
[1:24:14] death and hell is now laying on our side
[1:24:17] if we become one with you
[1:24:19] Lord then we have what you have we're HS
[1:24:24] and join HS yes Lord not a lesser
[1:24:28] person father that's what you wanted man
[1:24:30] to realize when you spoke in Genesis
[1:24:32] 1:26 you wanted man to realize that we
[1:24:36] are God on the
[1:24:39] earth and that you have given us the
[1:24:42] ability to rule and Reign because it
[1:24:45] comes down from Genesis 1 126 to rule
[1:24:47] and Reign and here we are in Revelations
[1:24:50] 5 it tells us to be Kings and priest
[1:24:52] Prest and the prophet said one time he
[1:24:53] said to be a king and a priest you got
[1:24:55] to have somebody to rule over yes Lord
[1:24:58] Lord just let our Holy Spirit rule over
[1:25:01] all
[1:25:01] things all powers all
[1:25:05] enemy anything that comes Among Us Lord
[1:25:08] let the Holy Spirit bind together and
[1:25:11] we'll take that sword and we'll take it
[1:25:14] I believe we've got it right at the
[1:25:16] devil's heart because there's only one
[1:25:18] thing left and that's death destroyed in
[1:25:20] these bodies father help us
[1:25:23] keep us be with us be with our pastor be
[1:25:25] with the deacons be with the elders be
[1:25:27] with everyone in the sanctuary Lord just
[1:25:29] take us and mold us into your image
[1:25:32] bless us and be with us father as we
[1:25:34] go as we take your name the lovely name
[1:25:37] of Jesus Christ with us everywhere we go

[1:25:54] the
[1:25:56] Everlasting and
