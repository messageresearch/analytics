[0:00] god bless you this morning it's good to
[0:02] be in the house of lord
[0:05] we had a real fine time at uh bible
[0:07] study last night
[0:10] we always enjoy on the way home thinking
[0:12] about all the things that are said the
[0:13] comments are made
[0:14] and everything um if the brothers in the
[0:17] back could go ahead and pull up hebrews
[0:18] 1
[0:20] and they they told me last time that the
[0:22] audio didn't pick up on the recording so
[0:24] i'll kind of
[0:26] go back a little bit and summarize sorry
[0:29] about that
[0:30] i don't know if we know what happened
[0:31] but anyway
[0:34] um hebrews 1.
[0:40] that's all right i'll just i'll talk for
[0:42] a few minutes
[0:44] while y'all get it up um so you know
[0:47] last time we were kind of talking about
[0:48] how paul and the book of hebrews is
[0:50] is trying to he he he kind of lays out
[0:54] that
[0:54] um who we're who we have faith in and
[0:57] and
[0:58] that this is not just an ordinary man
[0:59] it's not just an angel or
[1:01] or something like that or or a minister
[1:03] uh this is this is actually god ex
[1:06] that full expression of god revealed in
[1:08] flesh
[1:09] and and you know through the book of
[1:11] hebrews he just builds up builds up he
[1:13] begins to tell you about how the uh you
[1:15] enter into the sabbath rest and
[1:17] and and showing that this is that same
[1:19] man that walked came to abraham and
[1:21] showed himself and
[1:22] building building up until in hebrews 11
[1:24] he says
[1:25] everybody else has has has uh
[1:28] has been successful in their in their
[1:30] walk by believing and that's the way
[1:32] that you're going to be successful by
[1:33] believing
[1:34] not now you know who to believe in that
[1:36] you believe in the son of god who's been
[1:38] who's expressed himself in flesh and and
[1:40] that's that's who we
[1:41] have confidence in that we have a high
[1:43] priest who could be touched by the
[1:44] feelings of our infirmity somebody that
[1:46] that entered in once for all of our sins
[1:49] that that we don't have to keep coming
[1:50] back and offering a sacrifice year after
[1:52] year
[1:53] and so now brother branham said about
[1:55] hebrews 1 he said what is paul trying to
[1:57] do he's trying to show that god purposed
[1:59] all things in christ
[2:01] and christ was the express image of god
[2:04] the entire rest of the chapter deals
[2:06] with how that he was
[2:07] higher than angels higher than all
[2:09] powers angels worshipped him
[2:11] paul was trying to magnify him he's
[2:13] trying to magnify him so we'll have an
[2:15] understanding of this of who this person
[2:17] is and i kind of think about um you know
[2:20] how brother random talked about how
[2:22] uh john the baptist when he was
[2:23] introducing the son of man and again
[2:25] brother branham and this day introducing
[2:27] it's like eliezer kind of painting a
[2:29] picture
[2:30] so that you would know and that's kind
[2:32] of what paul is doing here
[2:33] when you read the bible you begin to get
[2:35] a picture of who jesus
[2:37] is and who it is we serve so even though
[2:39] you haven't actually met him in the
[2:40] flesh
[2:41] that the picture begins to be painted
[2:43] out so much that
[2:45] you know you begin to understand his
[2:47] deity and what his name is and
[2:49] all the all the characteristics about
[2:51] him that that
[2:52] and it builds up your faith where you
[2:54] begin to realize that if i i i
[2:56] i can have confidence that if i come to
[2:58] him according to the prescription
[3:00] that that he's there to to to fulfill
[3:03] his word in my life
[3:05] so let's just kind of summarize i think
[3:07] we made it to about verse four
[3:09] the the last two lessons so just kind of
[3:11] summarize again god who at sundry times
[3:13] and in diverse manners spaking time past
[3:15] unto the fathers by the prophets
[3:18] and paul's laying out that yeah he spoke
[3:21] it
[3:22] this is this this man that we're talking
[3:23] about is the one who was doing the
[3:25] speaking in the old testament but now
[3:27] now he actually manifested himself in
[3:29] flesh and now that's who we're hearing
[3:31] now in this in this
[3:32] last day hath in these last days spaking
[3:34] unto us by his son whom he hath
[3:36] appointed heir of all things
[3:38] and bill o'brien explains that he was
[3:40] you know he was predestinated for that
[3:42] purpose he was appointed heir
[3:44] of all things he came he came to the
[3:46] earth to fulfill his appointment
[3:48] to die on the cross that we might have
[3:51] have a way to to enter into fellowship
[3:53] with him
[3:54] by whom also he made the worlds who
[3:56] being the brightness of his glory
[3:58] and the express image of his person in
[4:01] other words he fully expresses
[4:02] everything there all the characteristics
[4:05] all the attributes of god
[4:06] were fully expressed in this person he
[4:08] was the brightness of his glory
[4:11] and upholding all things by the word of
[4:13] his power
[4:14] in other words he's he's trying to
[4:16] stress so much that this this man is the
[4:18] one that spoke all things with
[4:19] is into existence everything that you
[4:21] can see is actually uphold the sun and
[4:24] the moon and the stars and everything is
[4:25] upheld by
[4:26] the word of his power when he had him by
[4:30] himself purged our sins
[4:32] sat down on the right hand of the
[4:34] majesty on high
[4:36] now this is where hebrews kind of gets a
[4:38] little bit weighty he starts to he
[4:40] starts to quote david and talking about
[4:42] how the the lord said unto my lord sit
[4:44] down on my right hand until i until i i
[4:46] make all the enemies that footstool and
[4:47] those kind of things that we'll get into
[4:49] that a little bit more later on
[4:51] and you know you you got to the more i
[4:54] really
[4:54] study on this you've got to have an
[4:57] understanding
[4:58] of these kind of things so that you get
[5:00] in your in your mind the right picture
[5:02] when you begin to get over in the book
[5:03] of revelation that talks about one
[5:05] sitting on the throne sitting on the
[5:07] father strolling what does that mean
[5:08] where
[5:09] where is he sitting and and kind of
[5:11] begin to picture
[5:12] so you get the picture right when you
[5:15] begin to read the
[5:16] book of revelation and he comes off of
[5:17] the throne and it says
[5:19] now brother brown said now i don't
[5:21] talking about sat down on the right hand
[5:23] of the majesty on high
[5:25] let's let's just kind of think sit down
[5:27] you you can begin to think that there's
[5:29] there's like two people
[5:31] that that jesus is sitting down at the
[5:32] right hand of the father like sitting
[5:34] sitting next to him and then you got in
[5:36] your mind
[5:36] two people but that's not that's not
[5:38] what he's trying to
[5:40] express here now brother ram said no i
[5:42] don't mean god's got a right hand
[5:45] god's a spirit but at the right hand
[5:47] means in power and authority of god
[5:50] that in that name everything in heaven
[5:53] is named after it and subject to it
[5:55] everything in earth is named after it
[5:56] and subject to a name above all names so
[5:59] he's sitting
[5:59] he's sitting at the right hand which
[6:01] means in power and authority of god
[6:04] now i'm gonna kind of breeze past that
[6:06] and we're gonna hit it again later on
[6:08] because let's go on to hebrews 1 4. it
[6:11] says being made
[6:13] so much better than the angels as he
[6:15] hath by
[6:16] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[6:19] name
[6:20] than they so he's got he can't he
[6:22] inherited
[6:23] in other words he it was it was when he
[6:26] came when he was born in the manger
[6:28] yet the name that was given to him was
[6:30] the same name
[6:31] that the father had which is not a
[6:33] different person
[6:34] but the same person he's now expressing
[6:37] himself in a different office now he's
[6:39] in flesh
[6:40] but he's come with it he's inherited the
[6:42] name now
[6:43] now now you know brother branham really
[6:45] nailed down in his sermons how important
[6:47] that
[6:48] name a name is the name is actually
[6:51] it's it's actually so this name is more
[6:55] is more excellent than all the angels
[6:58] more excellent than
[6:59] any other preacher any any other more
[7:02] excellent why why is it where is that so
[7:04] it's because
[7:05] that name that he inherited is actually
[7:08] the name of god and in that name
[7:10] conveys all the characteristics and all
[7:12] the attributes of who
[7:14] god is that he's a redeemer and a savior
[7:17] and a deliverer
[7:18] he's he's he's the one that was that was
[7:20] there to deliver the israelites out of
[7:22] egypt he's
[7:23] all those characteristics are bundled up
[7:25] in that name
[7:26] so when you when you hear the name of
[7:29] jesus it it can that's what it conveys
[7:32] and so so so brother adam said in god's
[7:35] chosen
[7:36] place of worship he said he is god's
[7:38] chosen place of worship
[7:40] and god's name is given to him
[7:43] he is god's place of worship and god's
[7:46] name is given to him
[7:49] he is the word of god and he is the name
[7:52] of god
[7:53] he is both the word of god and the name
[7:55] of god
[7:56] he was the word made flesh he was the
[7:58] word of god
[7:59] lamb of god name of god and was god
[8:02] that's what he was the chosen and only
[8:04] place
[8:05] of worship to god
[8:08] yeah that's a fantastic sermon to listen
[8:10] to god's uh chosen place of worship
[8:13] because in that sermon he's talking
[8:14] about where you've got to
[8:17] uh he's reading the scripture and old in
[8:19] deuteronomy talking about how that god
[8:21] will
[8:22] the place where god puts his name and if
[8:24] that's where
[8:25] that's where you can the only place
[8:27] that's
[8:28] that's honored to worship goddess is
[8:30] where he puts his name so if you can
[8:32] find the place
[8:33] where god's name is and worship him in
[8:34] that way then you're worshiping god in
[8:36] the correct way and and
[8:38] and in that sermon he explains that the
[8:40] where god puts his name was in christ so
[8:42] if you can get in christ
[8:44] you can you can enter into correct
[8:46] worship with god
[8:47] so so we know that so he came he came in
[8:50] the father's name and that's what he
[8:51] said in john chapter 5 verse 43
[8:53] i come in my father's name and you
[8:56] receive me not
[8:57] if another shall come in his own name
[8:58] him you will receive so
[9:00] he came in his father's neck what's the
[9:01] father's name the father's name is jesus
[9:04] christ
[9:04] the father's name is jesus so you know
[9:07] uh you might ask
[9:08] somebody well you know uh you begin
[9:12] you're talking about the correct way to
[9:13] baptize and and those kind of things
[9:15] baptize
[9:15] jesus said in matthew 28 and 19 to be
[9:18] baptized
[9:19] in the name of the father son and holy
[9:21] ghost
[9:22] now of course you you would
[9:26] so the question is how what what is the
[9:27] name of the father son and holiness the
[9:29] name is jesus
[9:31] so you know if somebody were to write i
[9:34] i heard some uh
[9:36] i was listening to somebody talking
[9:37] about a plane trip that they were on a
[9:39] pentecostal won this preacher and he was
[9:41] on a plane trip and he began to talk to
[9:42] the person in the seat next to him
[9:44] and they got into a discussion about
[9:46] this and he said about the name of god
[9:48] and he said
[9:49] he asked the person sitting next to him
[9:51] he said if
[9:52] if you were going to write a check you
[9:54] would put your name on it right you
[9:56] wouldn't put father or son or
[9:58] or holy or you know something like that
[10:00] father or son you would actually put
[10:01] your name on it
[10:02] and that's the same thing it is in the
[10:04] gospel if you're gonna if you were gonna
[10:05] get a check from god
[10:07] how would god put what would god put
[10:09] there in this slot for his name he would
[10:11] put
[10:12] jesus he wouldn't put father or son or
[10:14] holy ghost or anything like that he
[10:16] would put his name
[10:18] so you begin to see how paul's paul
[10:21] as we go through hebrews is laying out
[10:23] he begins to unfold the revelation of
[10:25] who
[10:25] who jesus is and he begin to understand
[10:28] how to
[10:29] have fellowship with him because you're
[10:31] you understand his attributes and
[10:32] understand his name
[10:34] and and um
[10:37] let me read this you know what even when
[10:41] jesus
[10:42] when jesus was coming into jerusalem
[10:44] they they began and they were laying
[10:46] palm fronds and at his feet and they
[10:47] they said the bible says they went
[10:49] before and they that followed cried
[10:51] saying
[10:51] hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the
[10:54] name of the lord cometh in the name of
[10:56] the lord so they were actually
[10:57] testifying
[10:58] that this man riding in is coming in the
[11:00] name of the lord
[11:01] blessed be the kingdom of our father
[11:03] david that cometh in the name of the
[11:04] lord
[11:05] hosanna in the highest now brother i'm
[11:08] in the philadelphian church age he said
[11:10] and what is the name of god
[11:12] he was god with us or emmanuel but that
[11:15] was not his given name
[11:17] thou shalt call his name jesus jesus
[11:20] said i came in my father's name and you
[11:22] received me not therefore the name of
[11:24] god
[11:24] is jesus for that is the name he came in
[11:28] he is lord jesus christ and what name
[11:31] does a woman take when she marries the
[11:33] man
[11:33] she takes his name it will be his name
[11:36] that is given unto the bride when he
[11:38] takes her to himself
[11:40] now you see the name is actually what
[11:42] the thing is
[11:44] maybe you go back to the garden of eden
[11:45] when adam began to name all the animals
[11:47] and he would give
[11:48] the name of the of a parrot to a parrot
[11:50] because it it
[11:51] would repeat after things and and so he
[11:54] by
[11:55] by the spirit of god that was in him he
[11:57] was able to say that is a parent
[11:59] and and so then from then on whenever
[12:01] you would look at a parrot you would say
[12:03] that's a parrot because
[12:04] the name is actually what it is now you
[12:07] see that that carries on over
[12:09] when you become a christian and you've
[12:10] got the name of jesus
[12:12] that then that actually carries with it
[12:14] you've got you're called a christian
[12:16] because you're displaying the attributes
[12:18] of christ
[12:19] you're called you're called that because
[12:22] you're actually displaying
[12:23] it's it's showing forth what it is
[12:26] a name the name is what it is and that's
[12:30] why brother branham put so much stress
[12:31] into
[12:32] don't call your don't don't name your
[12:35] kids
[12:35] like elvis or don't name them ricky or
[12:38] something because the name
[12:40] actually conveys what that thing is you
[12:42] wouldn't call your child
[12:44] elvis because the elvis actually
[12:47] uh it's the label for the
[12:49] characteristics of of
[12:51] that rock and roll star that would twist
[12:53] himself and move and had all that
[12:55] perverted spirit and the perverted
[12:56] nature and that kind of thing so if you
[12:58] call
[12:58] your child elvis then you're trying to
[13:01] lay put that label on them and say i
[13:03] want my child
[13:04] to be to be displaying those kind of
[13:06] characteristics
[13:08] it'd be the same thing as like you hear
[13:09] sometimes people will name their their
[13:11] kids
[13:11] that uh i've even heard them they'll
[13:13] name their kids like cain or something
[13:15] like that
[13:16] or or or pick a pick up like a bad name
[13:19] from the bible and
[13:20] you wonder why would you do that because
[13:22] a name actually has a meaning
[13:24] and you put a name on on a child or
[13:26] something like that
[13:27] and it it carries with it the
[13:29] characteristics of
[13:31] of that thing and so brother ram and
[13:34] modern events are made clear by prophecy
[13:36] he's
[13:36] he said that's that's the reason i say
[13:38] don't ever call your child
[13:40] ricky or elvis for something elvis means
[13:43] cat
[13:43] ricky's a rat see when you say that's
[13:45] exactly right
[13:47] don't you never call one of your
[13:49] children that
[13:50] if it is change it right quickly people
[13:53] don't you if you believe me to be god's
[13:54] servant don't tack that name on that
[13:57] poor child
[13:58] see he's trying to convey to the people
[14:00] that a name actually
[14:02] has a meaning the name jesus has a
[14:04] meaning
[14:05] the name the the christian has a meaning
[14:07] there's a meaning to it
[14:09] because it shows what is under under it
[14:12] it shows
[14:13] what you are your characteristics
[14:16] it it remember when david when david
[14:19] came to goliath he said
[14:21] in the bible in first samuel 17 it said
[14:23] then then said david to the philistine
[14:25] then thou comest to me with a sword
[14:27] and with a spear and with a shield but i
[14:29] come to thee in the name
[14:31] of the lord of hosts in other words he
[14:32] was coming as a representative
[14:35] of everything that that name represented
[14:37] that everything that that name
[14:39] stood for
[14:44] and brother brahman once more he said
[14:45] what have we got the pentecostal people
[14:47] today he said you never heard that in
[14:49] other days
[14:49] it's a word it's a name for this day it
[14:52] goes with this
[14:53] it means something you say a name means
[14:56] nothing
[14:57] then why did he change abram's name to
[14:59] abraham
[15:00] why did he change saul's name to paul
[15:03] simon's name to peter
[15:05] why did he change his own name why did
[15:08] he change
[15:08] jacob to israel not until he wrestled
[15:11] with the lord not until he ever and and
[15:13] he's just stressing that a name
[15:15] means something so we know the name of
[15:17] god we know that
[15:18] that his name and we can enter into
[15:20] worship with him because
[15:24] because we've come we've we've become
[15:26] part of him and
[15:27] programming and in that sermon that i
[15:29] was i was quoting
[15:30] uh where he talks about the pla
[15:32] worshiping god and
[15:33] and where his name is he talks about how
[15:37] we're
[15:37] baptized into that one body and that's
[15:40] how we get into the end of the name
[15:42] and first corinthians 12 13 it says for
[15:44] by one spirit we're
[15:46] all baptized into one body whether we be
[15:49] jews
[15:50] or gentiles whether we be bond or free
[15:52] and have been all made to drink
[15:54] into one spirit so we get into that name
[15:58] by being baptized by one spirit
[16:00] and then we can correctly pray in his
[16:03] name because we're part of that name
[16:05] and part of everything that it
[16:06] represents
[16:08] and and and that's why colossians 3 17
[16:10] says
[16:11] whatsoever you do in word or deed do all
[16:15] in the name of the lord jesus so
[16:16] everything that we do as christians
[16:18] everything that we do in our life is
[16:20] is in the name of jesus because we're
[16:22] part of that one body
[16:24] part of him by one spirit we're all
[16:26] we're all
[16:27] wrapped up in him now let's go back to
[16:29] hebrews 1.
[16:33] let's keep that pulled up hebrews 1
[16:36] verse
[16:37] 5. so we know we know the name of god we
[16:40] know that
[16:41] that that this man that paul's talking
[16:43] about is the express
[16:44] image of the father the express image of
[16:47] his person the brightness of his glory
[16:49] and now we know the name
[16:50] he said he came that he the name that he
[16:53] came with was
[16:54] was the name of the father it's what
[16:56] he's laying out
[16:57] and he said for unto which of the angels
[16:59] in verse five for unto which of the
[17:01] angels said he at any time
[17:03] thou art my son this day have i begotten
[17:06] thee
[17:07] and again i will be to him a father and
[17:09] he shall be to me a son
[17:11] and again when he bringeth in the first
[17:13] begotten into the world he saith and let
[17:15] all the angels of god worship him
[17:18] so he's saying now now this is you've
[17:21] heard a lot from
[17:21] all the angels and and but which of the
[17:23] angels did he say
[17:26] i will be to him a father and he shall
[17:27] beat me a son and this day have i
[17:29] begotten thee
[17:31] so we know we know that he's laying out
[17:34] that he's the only
[17:38] verse five yeah go by to verse five
[17:41] just leave it there for a second but
[17:43] he's the only begotten
[17:45] now you you begin to think in your mind
[17:48] what does only begotten mean
[17:50] so brother brown said in god's power to
[17:53] transform he said now this great creator
[17:56] had placed his created son now adam was
[17:59] his first created son
[18:01] jesus was his only begotten son
[18:04] see he was begotten by a woman now he
[18:07] see here
[18:08] again he's expressed he's showing that
[18:09] that this man that was that the
[18:11] expressed image of the father
[18:13] was begotten by a woman and and born in
[18:16] flesh born by a virgin birth
[18:18] and now he's the only begotten and in
[18:20] other words he's a one of a kind
[18:23] he's a the only one that was ever to
[18:25] come
[18:26] that way the only the only one that was
[18:29] ever to
[18:29] be the full expression of god birthed in
[18:32] a woman
[18:33] come forth without any sin and and so
[18:36] and and uh he said jesus was his only
[18:40] begotten son and see he was
[18:42] begotten by a woman but adam was right
[18:44] straight from the hand of the god
[18:45] of god and the creation so adam was like
[18:48] spoken
[18:49] and spoken into existence but jesus
[18:51] actually was begotten he was birthed
[18:53] by a woman and and the actual expression
[18:56] of god himself and brother ram in the
[18:58] message thirst he said
[18:59] and just leave that up for a minute
[19:01] we'll just kind of so we can kind of
[19:03] meditate on those words
[19:05] he said in the message thirst god
[19:08] himself become one of us
[19:10] no man has seen the father any time the
[19:13] only begotten of the son
[19:15] of the father has declared him that's
[19:17] god became a man
[19:19] so he could fellowship you as a man see
[19:22] and now you are flesh
[19:24] and he is flesh god is made flesh
[19:27] among us in the person of his son jesus
[19:29] christ
[19:31] and in him was god he was god nothing
[19:34] short of god
[19:35] he was god god manifested in the son
[19:38] jesus christ
[19:39] so he was manifest he came that way so
[19:42] that he could have
[19:43] fellowship with you and and go through
[19:45] the same sufferings and
[19:46] have headaches and trials and
[19:48] tribulations and those kind of things he
[19:50] was the only begotten
[19:51] that way so that he could he could he
[19:53] could be touched by the feelings of
[19:55] infirmities and know the things that you
[19:58] that you go through and and be your
[19:59] brother that yeah
[20:00] and so when you pray you can have
[20:02] confidence that
[20:03] you know he he went through a lot of the
[20:06] same things that you go through
[20:09] and john 1 14 and says and the word was
[20:11] made fleshed and dwelt among us and we
[20:13] beheld his glory the glory is of the
[20:16] only begotten of the father
[20:18] full of grace and truth and john 3 16
[20:21] we've got that great promise in john 3
[20:23] 16 that for god so loved the world
[20:25] that he gave his only begotten son that
[20:28] whosoever believeth in him
[20:30] should not perish but have everlasting
[20:32] life and in first
[20:34] john 4 9 it says and this was manifested
[20:36] the love of god toward us
[20:39] because that god sent his only begotten
[20:42] son
[20:42] into the world that we might live
[20:44] through him you think about that that
[20:45] god
[20:46] that god expressed in flesh the fullness
[20:50] of his deity
[20:51] and then they took that man in flesh and
[20:53] crucified him and hung
[20:54] hung him on a cross he went through all
[20:56] those things that
[20:57] all the journeys of life going out in
[20:59] the wilderness and being tempted and and
[21:02] suffering and things so that so that we
[21:04] could have a
[21:05] more full fellowship with him now
[21:08] now the begotten that word begotten the
[21:10] only begotten
[21:11] in the in the greek it comes from uh
[21:15] and i'll just read a few more things and
[21:16] then we'll we'll end up here
[21:19] it's actually the word monogenes which
[21:21] means it's like
[21:22] mono genes in other words it's one of a
[21:25] kind
[21:26] there's nobody else like it one of a
[21:27] kind one and only
[21:29] the only begotten and you know
[21:31] interestingly in
[21:32] in hebrews that same word is used to
[21:35] describe
[21:36] isaac because isaac was a type of that
[21:39] one and only the only begotten and isaac
[21:42] in the old testament was a type that
[21:44] that that abraham took him up on on the
[21:46] mountain and and was going to
[21:48] sacrifice him and was ready to get ready
[21:51] to kill him
[21:52] all in a type of what jesus went through
[21:54] that jesus
[21:55] gave his life for us on the cross that
[21:57] fully yielded himself to the father
[22:00] monogenes monogenes of one of a kind the
[22:03] only begotten
[22:04] now in the resurrection of lazarus
[22:07] brotherhood said again but now in the
[22:08] beginning of jesus ministry
[22:11] he's such a great person there never was
[22:14] no no one ever on the earth like him
[22:17] and there never will be anyone like him
[22:20] he was the only begotten son of almighty
[22:23] god
[22:25] we are sons by adoption through him
[22:28] but he is god's only begotten son
[22:31] he's god's only begotten and you see
[22:33] paul's expressing this so much that
[22:35] or reiterating through chapter one
[22:37] because it's so important
[22:39] that this is not this is not just a good
[22:42] man
[22:43] or a good prophet or uh somebody that a
[22:46] good philosopher
[22:47] but it's actually god expressing himself
[22:49] in flesh
[22:51] and and we we're so just thank god so
[22:54] much to to be able to look into the
[22:56] scripture
[22:59] and and have an understanding of all how
[23:01] he expressed all of these attributes and
[23:03] how we can know the name of god and
[23:06] all these things about him now let's
[23:09] read
[23:09] uh let's let's start on hebrews 1 7
[23:12] we'll just read this and then we'll
[23:13] close on this
[23:16] and it says of the angels he saith who
[23:18] maketh his angels spirits and his
[23:20] ministers a flame of fire
[23:23] of the angels he saith who maketh his
[23:25] angel spirits and his ministers of flame
[23:27] of fire now
[23:28] now you know see see paul is beginning
[23:30] to bridge the
[23:31] the from the earthly to the supernatural
[23:33] we believe we believe that this is a
[23:35] supernatural gospel we believe in angels
[23:38] that angels angels appear to people in
[23:40] the old testament that they appeared to
[23:42] to um to daniel and appeared in many
[23:44] different situations
[23:46] and you see it's not a strange thing for
[23:48] a man to have seen an
[23:49] angel and now paul we knew that we know
[23:51] that paul
[23:52] uh angels were present in his ministry
[23:55] and even when he was shipwrecked he
[23:56] he talked about how an angel appeared to
[23:58] him and you see it's not straining it's
[24:00] not a strange thing
[24:02] to be listening to a man a prophet of
[24:04] god talk about
[24:05] how an angel appeared to him and told
[24:07] him things and vindicated his ministry
[24:09] and the musicians can go ahead and come
[24:10] on up and we'll
[24:11] we'll close on this because we believe
[24:14] in a supernatural gospel
[24:16] where angels are present and we'll next
[24:18] time we'll talk about
[24:20] what brother branham said these angels
[24:21] that paul were talking about
[24:23] really are that minister the gospel
[24:27] and we'll close on that
[24:30] god bless you
