we're just going to go ahead and go to the lord in in prayer and uh right before we read the word so let's just buy our heads our gracious lord jesus we thank you father for the opportunity that we

of your word lord and father how we thank you for that lord and we appreciate lord jesus what you are doing in our midst sometimes lord god we may not understand lord but father we certainly none we certainly know lord that you are in control lord you're not asleep lord your word tells us father god that you're not a god that slumbers or that needs sleep lord jesus but you are attentive lord god and you are mindful lord jesus of of our every situations and lord god we just thank you father that we serve a god like you lord not a dead god father but a god that's alive and that raised father god from from death lord god and it lives lord jesus throughout all eternity lord and that god now father is reigning in us lord and we just thank you for that lord jesus may you have your way here in

god and fulfill that healing in them lord that you purchased for them on the cross of calvary lord over 2000 years ago lord god and lord we just thank you father god because we consider it done and we ask these things now in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ amen amen praise the lord if you have your your bibles uh let's let's just turn to the book of psalms psalms chapter 112. yeah psalms chapter 112 and we're just going to read the whole chapter and it's only 10 verses but i want to concentrate on verses 7 and 8. psalms 112 it says praise ye the lord blessed is the man that feareth the lord that delighteth greatly in his commandments his seed shall be mighty upon earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed wealth and riches shall be in his house in his righteousness endureth forever and his righteousness endureth forever unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness he is gracious and full of compassion and righteous a good man showeth favor and lendeth he will guide his affairs with discretion surely he shall not be moved forever the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance and now watch verse 7 it says he shall not be afraid of evil tidings his heart is fixed trusting in the lord and uh in the contemporary english version it says it this way i like the way it says bad news won't bother them they have decided to trust the lord amen his heart his heart is established he shall not be afraid until he see his desire upon his enemies he hath dispersed he hath given to the poor his righteousness and endureth forever his horn shall be exalted with honor the wicked shall see it and be grieved he shall gnash with his teeth and melt away the desire of the wicked shall perish praise the lord jesus amen so we want to we want to speak this morning amen on the a little title called when bad news strikes when bad news strikes and uh i was going to continue ministering on the uh what i was ministering on wednesday about advancing god's kingdom by fulfilling the law of christ but maybe next time when we next time we minister we will continue with that i just felt impressed to just go this route because certainly uh saints we've we've had a lot of bad news in the past several days but um you know and then looking in the word you know and you know all around us there's always bad news you know you look into you look in the news and and you know how are the how the news companies make money you know they got to proclaim bad news i mean nobody makes money they don't make money proclaiming good news uh every now and then you might see something good in in mainstream media but most of the time is bad news bad news uh came across a website a couple of years ago and it actually it was called a website called happynews.com and i think the site's still up but it hasn't been updated in a long time but uh it was everything anything that you could think of happy news it was it was right there so uh certainly a different alternative from from what we see at cnn fox news and all these but they they have that's how they make their living is through bad news but you know verse 7 here tells us he shall not be afraid of evil news or evil tidings why because his heart is fixed trusting in the lord amen and that's how god wants us to do amen is to trust in him no matter what news comes along our way no matter what takes place or what's happening all around us and no matter how dark it gets we must stay steadfast on what god has placed in our hearts because that's that's the way that's the way jesus lived his life uh you know many times and we'll look at it in in a little bit later but you know him being in a boat uh uh sleeping just just just not concerned he was tired but he was not concerned when the disciples were there waking him up you know lord don't you see that we're going to perish because there's a storm you know and the boat's about to sink water's coming in and jesus was sitting in the back amen on a pillow resting his head not even concerned of what was going on why because he was he knew where he was standing he knew where he was fixed he was god here on earth and and so that's how god wants us to do in this hour because if we had christ in us that same spirit that dwelled in him amen it's the same spirit amen that is in you praise god is is the same god amen that is in you in the form of the holy ghost and that is the exact same way that we should take amen when we hear bad tidings when we hear bad things happen all around us i know the human the human reaction is to be afraid the human reaction is to is to quickly react and the human reaction is to is to worry but god tells us amen here in his word he shall not be afraid of evil tidings his heart is fixed trusting in the lord praise god amen you know what satan what he tries to do is he many times he tries to divert our attention by bad news when we're we're we're happy we're rejoicing we're serving the lord nothing bad is happening in our lives i mean we have to work we get tired we uh we have to deal pay bills and different things then all of a sudden bad news strikes or something happens in our lives that completely changes things and and and and and that's when god wants to see where you're really standing now satan would try to use those those situations to divert our attention to divert our our faith in god to put it in in more in a doctor or in a medicine or in something else but god wants to see if okay he'll allow satan go ahead satan use whatever you need to do you are just a tool in my hands now let me see how my children are going to react now out of that situation you're either going to come out stronger or you're going to fail and god's going to have you do that lesson once again because each and every one of us uh god wants us to get to a certain point in our lives amen where we are mature christians and i believe the times that we are in now god is calling for that it's it god is really calling for that and and that's why we need to to really seek god more in prayer fasting do whatever it needs to happen because uh the time of playing games is over right the time of being nonchalant about serving god is over now it's time to really amen seek god and and and seek his will for our lives and we know his will is his word amen so we know that god's attributes they're manifested through negatives we know that that without if there was nobody to save uh he would not be a savior if there was nobody sick he would not be a healer we know all the attributes so it takes a positive it takes a negative and a positive amen to to have the full picture and you cannot have a full picture uh a color beautiful picture there was not a negative and there was not a positive there has to be both in order for there to to for the full picture and that's why sometimes we wonder lord why is this happening in my life what is this going on why why are you allowing this i mean that's the negative part but then the positive part is hey thanking god that you are uh for what you do have remember when we talked the other day about under pressure thanking him for what you we do have amen uh it could be worse it could be worse sometimes but but but then though it takes those two things that positive in that negative to bring out the full picture and eventually god will reveal that to us i used to i used to uh work in um not work but when i was in school i used to do photography and we would go to the dark room and it was all red and dark in there and we'd have all the chemicals when we were developing film and uh for those who remember what film is and we used to go in there and would put the film after taking pictures put the film in the different in the different uh uh liquids now you see that film had to go through all those processes right all those different processes and all being drowned amongst all those different little liquids amen in the midst of darkness in the midst of of of of it's red and dark amen but see i knew what i was doing god was in control god is in control i knew what liquid to put to put this film in first and then take it to this to this put it in this liquid and then do this and then make it dry out and eventually the negative comes out and then we can take out positive images out of that amen see god has a process and he's in he's in full control praise the lord so uh just quick examples in the word about uh uh when when bad news hits you know remember let's remember the story of esther esther heard bad news about a decree that had gone out haman was against the jews and uh uh mordecai uh which was her uncle uh he heard about the bad news and esther didn't have any idea her being the queen didn't even know and um and that's how we that's how we are sometimes you know in living in this life you know we we don't know everything we don't know why god is allowing what's happening amen i know one thing for sure i could just say that for me myself it's got me to pray more it's got me to seek god more it's got me to to to change my my the way i i view the the the brethren around me and and the people around me uh i i i i i i it's gotten to do that and i don't know about you but it's it's got me to do that so i thank god for that i thank god for for for because it it's those negative times that makes us look at ourselves esther didn't know what was going on mordecai got the message sent to her and it was bad news to her it was it was it wasn't certainly glad tidings it was bad tidings that her that her people were going to be destroyed haman made out the decree and it was stamped by the king and in the her her jewish the people were going to be destroyed and they were going to be killed and mordecai uh uh asked her all she could do the way she reacted is the only thing we can do is pray and fast and that's what she did and she called for a prayer and fast and told mordecai let all the people know that this is what we're gonna do for three days three days and she got up maybe she may not have heard anything audio audible from god but she got up with a confidence saying and she said listen if i perish i perish when i go before the king amen and and if we perish in in this hour but at least we did what we knew we were supposed to do we were responsible with the word that we had amen and that's all that god wants us to do to do is is is thou good and faithful servant amen what did you do with what i gave you amen and esther just went in there and before the king and not knowing if she was gonna die or if she was gonna live but she took that chance with the word and with what she had done backing her up amen and we know the rest of the story that that that the king accepted her amen he's put out his his scepter and she was able to come in she found she found grace before his eyes and uh the the jewish people they were able to to uh uh defend themselves before this proclamation that haman and you know who ended up losing it was haman haman which represents satan he was the loser the whole time the whole time he was thinking he was winning the whole time he was thinking he was he was all this whole thing is being activated it and i'm coming i'm rising up i'm rising up amen he's the one who ended up losing at the end esther became a man she became a hero amen she became not just only a hero but she's a representative of who the bride of christ is in this hour amen and the jewish people became out of that came a day that the the day of purim where they celebrate even to this day amen so i want us to look also in second chronicles chapter 20 if you have your bibles in second chronicles chapter 20. there was a another incident where uh king jehoshaphat who was one of the kings that the bible says that he did good in the eyes of the lord and he was a wise king and king jehoshaphat was about to be invaded by by moab and if you read the story there is very interesting because in second chronicles chapter 20 i'll just read verses three and four here it says in jehoshaphat uh fear now this is after he had heard see he was the king of judah at the time and he gets these news that moab was about to to invade them he and moab with the help of another uh uh they had another partner there was ammon i believe it was and they were getting ready to invade judah israel at the time and and jehoshaphat knew that they could not withstand the armies that were coming at me and this was bad news this was bad news i mean you as a commander you as a a king what would you do if you hear uh if if you heard uh let's just say the little little country of of guam amen and the leader there in guam or or whoever's uh and they hear all russia's coming to invade what what are you gonna what are you gonna do that was kind of similar what was happening here and so king jehoshaphat in verse 3 he says and jehoshaphat feared now see that was the natural thing for a human being to do but watch and he says and it's and set himself even though he feared it says and set himself to seek the lord and proclaimed a fast throughout all judah it's the same thing that esther did in verse 4 it says and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord i mean who else could we turn to when bad news comes when all darkness is all around us amen the only one that we can turn to is the lord i mean we can't we can't turn to anybody else amen he is the only one but that's where god wants us in posse that's where he wants to see us amen you know you don't think that that god didn't know that ammon was getting ready to invade judah god knew it all along he knew while they were planning it yet god wanted to see what jehoshaphat was going to do and so in verse 4 and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord my goodness wow out of all the cities of judah amen they got desperate god loves it when his children get desperate god loves desperation because out of desperation he does lots of great things amen because he wants to get the glory he wants you to see what he can do amen when you are completely back back back backed up into a wall amen and so in in uh in in reading here in verse 5 i want you to hear what jehoshaphat's prayer was amen because sometimes in reading the prayers that are they are made in in situations like these and then we learn things i mean sometimes even listening to brother branham's prayers we get some good nuggets out of those prayers and so jehoshaphat's prayer was recorded there in ii chronicles chapter 20 and verse 5 and it says in jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah so he he he may this was public and he wasn't in secretly i mean this is what he did before the people stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord before the new court and said oh lord god of our fathers art not thou god in heaven and rule us not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen and then thy hand is there not power in might so that none is able to withstand thee and that's what we we say in this hour amen but we know that he he's powerful art not thou our god who did us drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel and gave us it to the seed of abraham thy friend forever isn't he the same god that that healed yesterday isn't he the same god that's even raised the dead even amongst us amen isn't he the same god that's done mighty things around us we know that he is praise god and we are his seed we are the seed of abraham praise the lord wear his seed by faith praise god and why are these things happening to us that's exactly what what jehoshaphat was asking as well in verse 7 it says are not thou our god who did us drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel gave us it to the seed of abraham thy for thy friend forever and they dwelt therein and have built thee sanctuary therein for thy name saying if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and then thy presence for thy name is in this house amen thy name is in this house so why is this happening amen he's put his name in on in you amen we live by his name we're a people called by his name praise god and cry unto thee in our affliction then thou will hear and help in their case it was it was the house it was it was the temple amen it was it was the tabernacle amen where he had put his name in praise god and when you would look to that amen there would be help that's what jonas did while he was in the belly of the well he said if i look toward thy temple i know that i shall be saved praise god and now behold the children of ammon and moab and mount sayre whom thou wouldest not let israel invade when they came out of the land of egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not so here uh jehoshaphat is saying lord you allowed us to not even come against these people when we left egypt because uh the children of israel i mean they were they were slaying dragons left and right and slaying people therefore god was with them but these were people that they did not touch at all these were a people that that god allowed them to continue forward and they did not even bother them at all they did not have any any uh beef with them if you could say it that way though if you call it in in in current in our days terms but this is what jehoshaphat is saying now those people are coming against them and so when they came out of the land of egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not behold i say how they reward us look how look what they're doing to us now to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou has given us to inherit in other words they're come to to take us out and and exalt us from our from the land that you gave us lord and so in verse 12 and it says oh our god will thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company we we there's nothing we can do against this p this great company these great people that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee amen praise god now what did psalms 112 we just read said our eyes are fixed on thee lord we stay stand fast amen but our eyes are upon thee our eyes are not upon anything else amen our eyes are not upon the bad news that we're hearing but our eyes are upon the good news amen our eyes are upon what you said lord on the promises that you made we don't know what to do we don't know what's going on we can't explain every detail of what's happening but god you know what's happening lord you know what what what to do and in verse 13 and all judah stood before the lord listen all judah all israel oh my goodness all israel stood before the lord with their little ones their wives and their children and it wasn't just jehoshaphat it wasn't just just the priests it wasn't just the prophets it was the little ones the children everybody stood before the lord when bad news came amen when they heard these bad news that they were about to get invaded i wonder if we do that in this hour amen do we stay with our do we stand with our families amen do we do we get do do we get desperate before god or is it just you amen but is it all of our families amen when we all do that amen especially us as a congregation do that amen you'll you're going to see god do great things amongst us amen and so if you continue reading the story i don't have time to read it but if you continue reading that story god gives word after they prayed after they did what they were supposed to do god gives word to the prophet uh not to the prophet but to the levite jihazio and tells them that they were going to be victorious as a matter of fact they were not even going to fight at all they were going to they were it gives them the word that that that the enemies amen and all of them were going to actually destroy themselves they were going to destroy themselves and it wasn't you know normally the word of the lord comes to the prophet right this was a levite that received that word it wasn't it wasn't a it was just a common he was i believe he was a priest because the levites were priests it was just a priest that the word of the lord came to and this is this is uh uh what the the people of israel or the people of judah they took that and they went on they went with it and god and god destroyed their enemies and king jehoshaphat and judah prevailed amen but what did they have to do they prayed they fasted they got together and they said lord you've given us these promises you've given us this land you've given us this temple this place lord why would you do all of this father if you're not going to protect us if you're no you see we can't do anything god if you don't step in lord there's nothing we can do if god doesn't step in in this hour of saints amen there is nothing we can do amen god is the one that has to prevail god is the one that has to do the work amen and god wants it that way because god wants us to see amen the miracles that the the things that he can do and we've all seen them we've all seen great things that god has done in our lives amen but he wants us to see it again and again and again and again praise god amen what a wonderful story and we could go in in more details with that amen there's another another story similar to this if you read in isaiah chapter 37 where the the where king hezekiah he received bad news amen from king the king sennacherib of assyria and king sanakarib he was out destroying all the all the peoples around him and and and slain and taking over and now it was time for him to take over uh israel judah the same jihad the same judah that king uh jehoshaphat was over now king hezekiah was over the same land and here comes bad news from from from king sennacherib and in in this time it was by a letter that was sent to king hezekiah you can read there in isaiah chapter 37 he receives this letter and and i don't know if you all received bad news in in letter form or an email amen we're gonna have to close your your bank account or or or or or you know your life insurance policy is uh you know we're gone broke when we're gonna have to do or whatever it is whatever it may be you know bad news comes this was in the form of a letter this time king king uh jehoshaphat heard it by word of mouth now this time is by letter and it says if you read in king in isaiah chapter 37 and in verse 14 it says and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it he read it but watch and hezekiah went up unto the house of the lord and spread it before the lord he spread the problem before the lord amen he went up to the house of the lord you see these are people that did not even have the holy ghost and that's the reaction that they take how about us with the holy ghost amen what should we do when problems and and things come to our lives amen we should go that's that's the first thing we should think about amen praise god and this that's what hezekiah does he spreads this letter before the lord and he says and and he starts praying and watch in verse 15 and hezekiah prayed unto the lord saying oh lord of hosts god of israel that dwelleth between the cherubims thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou has made heaven and earth inclined on ear o lord and hear open thine eyes o lord and see and hear all the words of of sanakrib which have sent to reproach the living god he knew that it wasn't just a reproach towards the people but he was reproaching the living god by him by him uh saying this of a truth lord the kings of assyria have laid waste all the nations and their countries he knew that that's what was happening and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of man's hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them now therefore o lord our god save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord even thou only amen it wasn't a selfish prayer by by hezekiah just like jehoshaphat amen it was a prayer so that you lord can get the glory out of it amen we don't want these individuals a man to get healed amen just for the sake of getting healed amen but your lord so that you can get the glory out of it amen we don't want all these things that are happening all around us amen problems and situations lord you take care of these yes lord but so that ultimately you get the glory out of it because that's all we care about is that you get the glory lord amen and so if you continue reading amen god uh saves them from king from king from that king amen and gives them the victory and and and and protects them from from the king as a matter of fact uh uh they're destroyed and i believe if i understand correctly the two sons of that king senator killed his their own father and amen the same sword that they were going to kill with amen comes against them amen david says a lot in psalms he says the same devices that they have come up with lord that they fall in those same devices the same trap that satan puts amen to try to to hurt his children god's children amen let that same trap come upon him amen let that same trap come upon our enemies praise god but god knows what he's doing god allows the situation you don't think you don't think that god didn't know that that letter was going to be sent to king hezekiah god knew it before the foundation of the world he just wanted to see the reaction amen he wanted to put them in another position where they got desperate before god and you know what saints i i don't believe that this will be the first or last time that we will have bad news again it will continue bad news will always be around us and be here with us but it's like i said last time what are you going to do when it comes pressure when pressure comes what will you do amen it's what we do with pressure that uh either helps us advance or not advance amen you can read that there the rest of the story there in isaiah chapter 37. praise god you know and we were we were looking there at jesus amen where he was on the boat amen when he heard the bad news from the disciples that they were you know they were about to die due to this storm amen but jesus was just sleeping he didn't he did can you imagine that i mean just just right i mean as a matter of fact the waves moving and tossing to and fro was just rocking him to sleep even better and that's how that that's that is what troubles should do for the for the uh for the children for the children of god amen amen just rock us even more towards confidence towards him amen because why what does psalm 112 say again verse 7 he shall not be afraid of evil tidings his heart is fixed trusting in the lord amen and when jesus came amen he came to practice he came to live the word and that's why he was practicing amen he is the word praise god what happened you know that god amen he heard bad news himself even at the beginning when adam and eve sinned amen he heard bad news that his children had sinned and they've got no away from the word that he had commanded now did it take god by surprise no it did not he knew it all along as a matter of fact he knew it so much that he had already made a way for them even before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain in his mind before the foundation of the world amen he had made a way for them but he didn't take him by surprise and that's that that same god is the same god that we should have in us that when we hear the bad news amen doesn't take us by surprise because we know that he knows what is going on even though we don't know he knows and he has made a way out for us praise god he has already made a way of escape listen there's people that have that have passed away amongst us you know our precious brother don fear and you know he passed away amongst us he's a missionary uh and uh there to the philippines and different different countries of the world uh he he god took him amen this past week amen and apparently he died with covet and that god didn't that didn't take god by surprise that was just the avenue that god used amen to take our brother home amen that was just the avenue that he used and so god already has a way of escape amen for each and every one that could be the way of escape that god had for him that could be the way of escape amen sometimes even if god doesn't answer our prayer for the healing of the body amen and i was telling uh my wife this week in regards to brother royal you know brother roy you all just continue to pray for him in the philippines you know he's still he's still uh we're still believing that god is is touching his body and and and he's healing his body i mean he's still with us uh but uh just little by little he's got infection in his blood and uh it's gonna take some antibiotic treatment to to get rid of that but but i said you know i wonder if if it's god sometimes does things where he may prolong the healing of somebody not necessarily for that person because god can heal the body the body to be healed is not us is not difficult for him he is our healer he is the source of healing what if god is doing it for the ones around him for the hearts what he wants is the hearts and that's what's difficult it's more difficult not that it's difficult for him don't misunderstand me but it's what's it's tougher for him to deal with the hearts of the people because he cannot override their free moral agency you see he cannot override that he respects that he gave us that and so he's got he's got our brother may he's still laying in bed he's still sedated he's still having the problems but here his maybe family members maybe the friends people around him and god is trying to do something where maybe he's trying to touch the hearts amen and that's what he's more concerned about maybe he wants a more of a desperation for us to get together just like a king jehoshaphat and all the families and everybody got together in prayer amen god is more concerned about the heart than he is about the body amen amen he can heal the body no problem at all what god wants is the hearts amen because that's that's that's what he he cares for more amen and so sometimes if we look at situations that way there seem to be prolonged amen maybe god what he's waiting for is that we get our hearts right and then god will take care of the rest after that praise the lord amen so that is just how god wants us to react amen to bad news i mean he already has the solution he already has the solution all he wants us to do is maybe just get in action pray meditate pray get desperate before god amen amen just look real quick here at uh at things to do when bad news comes amen amen if we read in psalms chapter 28 verse 7 it says the lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusts in him and i am helped therefore my heart rejoices and i give thanks to him watch with my song amen amen with my song amen sing before god amen it'll help us get get it will help our heart rejoice and and it'll help us amen keep our eyes fixed on his promises amen psalms 56 4 in god whose word i praise and god i trust i will not be afraid what can man do to me praise god amen god doesn't want us to be afraid amen god wants us to just look to him amen again we're human we're going to we're going to our human tendencies is to be afraid and and and that's okay all right we're afraid all right let's stop and let's think lord you're the one that has control of the situation lord i'm just going to look to you because there's nothing i can do on my end you have to take over now psalms 57 7 my heart is steadfast oh god my heart is steadfast i will sing and make music amen that's the best thing to do many times amen just start singing amen just start praying you know i love listening to sister brenda lewis amen and uh if you if you if you uh she just the music that she that she uh the words and the music that she she she produced when she was here on earth with us still amen it she didn't know maybe she was writing it for me you know and yesterday i was listening to us some sermon yesterday and the brother was preaching and he was talking about sister brenda lewis and if you know know who sister brenda lewis she was a sister songwriter that lived in florida and she she produced that song stronger wind than this amen she she she wrote that song and i did not know that she write she wrote that song in the middle of a hurricane that was going through miami at the time through florida i don't know which hurricane it was and it was in the midst of the hurricane that she started producing she started writing the words to that song and the words of the song strong winds are blowing with the unrelenting force people running to and fro they don't know what's going on you know and it's just listen to us sometime but see if the hurricane wasn't coming through if the force wasn't coming through it would not help have produced those words amen to that song that song that is sung amongst our ranks a lot amen so my heart is steadfast i will sing and make music psalms chapter 108 verse 1 says my heart is steadfast there's a key thing here that we keep seeing steadfast steadfast and steadfast means firm stay stay put stand still amen oh god i will sing and make music with all my being again make music and then last one proverbs 1 33 but whoever listens to me will dwell in safety secure from the fear of evil amen praise god stay steadfast amen and wait you don't know what else to do you know how to sing sing before god make music in your heart amen and those things will renounce will resound and make give you strength give you give you faith amen i don't know if you all have heard the story of of of horatio spafford horatio spafford was the man who wrote the song it is well with my soul and he uh the the what he went through for us to have that hymn is is incredible amen and uh he was a he was a uh he he was a uh um a lawyer amen and he was a successful attorney and a real estate investor and he had lost all his fortune in the great fire in a great chicago fire of 1871. in that same year or that around that same time his four-year-old son died of scarlet fever so he lost everything he had his his his well you know and then he lost his son and then and then if you read the story he he sent his family he wanted to send them to england overseas because he thought maybe they they wouldn't they could use a good vacation after after having gone through all that he he went through he had four four daughters and his wife and they he sent them off because he had to stay back in chicago to finish up a few things he sent them off and in the middle of them going their ship uh hit another ship and and they sunk all i believe it was 200 200 people that were on board two or three hundred people that were on board including his four daughters they all died and so his wife gets to gets to england and she sends a message to him gets a message to him and tells him everybody all of our our daughters are gone they they they they sunk you know they they drowned and and she she said what shall we do she asked him in that and that what shall we do and so what horatio does is he immediately he set sail for england they and uh and as he was as the ship that he was on was going through the same area where his daughter's ship was as he was going through the same area the captain knew about horatio and what had happened to his daughters so he points out the spot where they had where the ship had sunk and his daughters and he looked at the spot and it just inspiration came upon him and he penned those words amen when peace like a river attendeth my way when sorrows like sea billows rule whatever my lot thou has taught me to know it is well it is well with my soul amen but if it hadn't taken that tragedy that horatio went through at losing his family losing everything he had his four-year-old son with scarlet fever amen we would not have that that that that well beloved hymn that we have today that has blessed many many probably many have come to the lord because of that hymn and it's blessed me and i'm sure that it has blessed you praise god amen and so we're not always going to be uh we're not always going to be exempt from tragedies we're not always going to be exempt from hard times and as i've said before i believe that god will allow more hard times more difficult times to come in our lives we're not exempt from them but are we going to come out stronger during those hard times are we going to or is something good god is trying to squeeze something good out of us amen through those hard times through those squeezes amen faith in a loving god will will with trust in his divine help and we can confidently say amen that is well with our soul amen bad news we're going to come but let me tell you saying that there's good news as well amen the good news is that jesus christ died for you amen he's resurrected amen he he came back in the form of the holy spirit amen filled 120 there in the upper room and now he wants to do the same for you and i amen and that good news that news right there has not changed it's still the same it's the same prescription from from yesterday it's good now and it will be good tomorrow amen you don't have to be you don't have to be overwhelmed by bad news there's good news the good news is is that he raised from the dead and that he's a healer and that he's still the same yesterday today and forever as hebrews 13 8 declares and i'll just finish with this brother branham says in the message hebrews chapter 2 in 1957 he says a messenger you are a messenger this morning you're a messenger of good news or a messenger of bad news oh isn't it beautiful to know that we are ambassadors that we are angels the messengers of the resurrection amen it doesn't have to be just a preacher amen it could be just you amen just a regular person here that comes to church a regular sister that tells somebody about the good news of the resurrection that there is they don't have to that person doesn't have to live and continue in their sin there's a christ there's a god that has made a way for them amen that they can come into christ and god can christ can come into them and they can be different people in this hour amen that god sent us a prophet in this our day amen to to open the the the word to us amen that was that that had been uh eaten down throughout all the ages and now it's been restored to us amen what good news that is amen amongst the bad news amen there's a people proclaiming amen good news in this hour amen to know that we are ambassadors that we are angels the messengers of the resurrection and we are god's messengers to the sinful world that christ lives in our hearts he lives in our spirits he lives and he brings us from the low the botched life of sin and exalts us up and gives us a hallelujah in our soul and makes us new creatures we are messengers angels of the covenant how wonderful amen how wonderful that is those good news amen praise the lord jesus so saints when bad news strikes amen let's just do what psalms 1 12 says let's just read again it says he shall not be afraid of evil tidings his heart is fixed trusting in the lord amen what horatio spafford did amen all he can do was just lord you know what was hap you know you knew what you were doing lord and so i'm just gonna trust in you amen praise god and just right before just right before we finish here like can i can we just sing amen just a little a little uh stanza or two from that song it is well with my soul amen and this is song 389. we don't have we don't have uh instruments but we'll just sing to him and if you have if you know the words you sing along with us there are those that are watching in when peace like a river attendeth my way when sorrows like sea billows roll whatever my lot thou has taught me to say [Music] it is well it is well with my soul it is well with my soul it is well it is well with my soul though satan should buff it though trials should come let this blessed assurance control [Music] that christ hath regarded my helpless estate and hath shed his own blood for my soul blessing that last verse but lord tis for thee for thy coming we wait the sky not the grave is our goal that's what we all want oh the shout of the angel the voice of the lord blessed hope blessed rest of my soul it is well it is well [Music] with my soul it is well it is well with my soul amen god bless you all saints i trust that when bad times and even the times that we're in now amen that you can just have that courage to just sing that amen it is well with my soul god knows what he's doing and saints don't fear death you know we we don't we we're called not to fear death we're called not to fear uh those things in life you know uh because death some is just uh just just the the as brother claude said the other day it's just the cadillac that god uses to take us amen to a better position amen praise god and death is just the door that we can just go through amen and get to the other to the other side praise god there's nothing there's nothing that death can death has already been conquered amen
