TRANSCRIPT
========================================
okay button now just hit the check make sure it's working it doesn't morning morning all right let's see today we're going to talk about agriculture oh okay and a s let's open with a word of prayer okay let's all pray our heavenly father we thank you for this chance to gather together today once again in Your Name Lord and we ask you as you said in your word you we're two or three gather that there you'd be in their midst Lord and we already know you were here Among Us ready to speak to us Lord just prepare our hearts to hear and receive the word today I want brother Dell's lips to speak and ours to hear and help me with the teaching of the Sunday school and bless all those who are away all those traveling brother W sister June and brother Aaron and all his family and all those other ones and brother Bob and his family just give them all tribe and mercies I pray and uh thank you for this beautiful day that you've given us and most of allk thank you for your word we love you give you all the glory and honor in Jesus name amen amen now a while back when I started thinking on this the Lord laid this on my heart about the time to plant because I realized that the time I'm in now is a young tender time and especially several years ago um I reached a a time in my life where it was a very decisive time where I I had to make a lot of decisions and I didn't realize then so much how those decisions would affect me in years to come but that's what we're going to talk about is both the natural and spiritual about planting seeds basically about the law of God of sewing and reaping okay now brother how back when in 2006 I graduated from college and there's a few other graduates here with me we had a little graduation party can you hear me mhm okay and brother Hal Thomas gave me some words of wisdom that didn't mean that much to me then I didn't know till later how much those words would mean to me he said Ryan think today about the decisions that you make how they will affect you in a year from now 5 years from now and 10 years from now and so forth so really be thoughtful about the choices you make and at that time it was that was in the spring of 2006 in the fall I met Gabby and then of course we were engaged in the spring of 2007 that was one of the biggest decisions of my life also I was making career choices during that time I was making gab I were making family choices we made a lot of big decisions and uh that have affected us ever since then we sewed seeds and now we're reaping and I'm beginning to see that but more importantly I'm seeing how that the seeds of the word that I sow in me in that time were are coming forth now as God is quickening those things see so we want to look at both the natural things and the spiritual things about cause and effect uh sewing and reaping okay Ecclesiastes 3 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted now I want to start doing an objective I want to start because we come straight in here right out of the world and the things worldly thing not bad things I mean the worldly things traffic and and whatever we're talking about out there we bring it right into here and it's hard to just go right into the word cuz upstairs we have the songs to prepare us for the service but down here we just sit right down and start listen to the word so thereby we might miss some of what's being said and I'm guilty to be sometimes Sunday afternoon I think well what was brother Wade talking about this morning I have to go back and listen to the tape because my mind was still on too other things so for that reason I want to start doing an objective I want to show you one key point one takeaway that you can take away and say well at least I remember this one thing that Ryan talked about this morning so if you don't remember anything else here's our objective to see that our duty is to be the right kind of field and sew the right kind of seed today so that God can give the increase tomorrow okay now you say well Ryan the son of man is the one that slds the seed that's right but we are the ones that read the word pray and study to show ourselves approv we have to plant the word in the womb of our mind before he can Quicken it to us see he's not just going to open our head and pour the word in so that's our part we have something to do with it another words and brother Bob when he was preaching here a while back I think this last time he preached he mentioned something about his experience and it agreed with my experience I found the same thing he said I made a little Discovery that's what he called it any remember him saying I made a little discovery that Discovery was the more you read and pray the more God quickens to you and that's uh you know you think well duh that makes that's obvious well yet it's not really common sense is not so common anymore okay so sometimes see I used to think that I'll just read the certain set amount every day and and no more no less and God will come and Quicken the word in his time well he will that doesn't mean if you don't read and study more that he won't Quicken more word to you you put the word there like David said Thy word have I hid in my heart oh God that I might not sin against thee so see that's our part to do with we keep eating the word keep feeding on that tree of life okay and brother Louise uh Wednesday night preached about uh well the mirror but in that he said James 4:8 draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you so thereby then we see the same thing that the more we draw closer to God the more read and study and pray and listen then the more God will come into US Qui am I quiet yeah I feel so loud all right Dave Ramsey a while back on the radio I was listening to him and he said your choices are seeds in the crop of your life and I thought that's very profound that was very enlightening as one of those kind of Common Sense things again it's not so common anymore your choices are the seeds in the crop of your life the natural and the spiritual the seeds you sew in the natural and the seeds you seow spiritually so I want to look at several examples of that again all right first off in your spiritual walk while everybody knows obviously we have one big decision to make in life that is the most important to accept or reject Christ and your Eternal destination lays on that choice the choice that you make to accept or reject Christ and obviously you'll spend eternity with God if you accept him or you'll be eternally separated from him if you reject him that is the most important seed to seow and you'll reap later on what you sow in life now for that but then within that there are many other spiritual choices to be made like within your spiritual walk how close are you going to walk to God are you going to read your Bible and pray every day or ha hazly just as as often as you get a chance cuz you'll never find a chance if you don't make time you'll never find time and Satan's even so are you going to walk close to God or you going to just hang out close to the or near the edge of the cliff so to speak you going to see how close to the world you can get or you going to see how close you get to God are you going to uh come to church every chance you can are you going to listen to sermons every chance you can or not and then within uh and those are seeds that you're sewing and you'll reap later on what you sew and then within marriage that's a the next biggest decision are you going to marry or not and if so who and who will you marry and where will you go to church where will you live those are all choices that have to be made I guess this is not the right audience to be talking to about marriage I mean because because y'all are all married for the most part sorry can you hear me S py can you hear me okay so so I got to y brother wait is so loud I wish I had his loans all right then career like I said a while ago and then your finances is there you have to make a lot of decisions sew a lot of sees and your finances uh for instance like in gabin are we going to handle our finances together or separate and are we going to have a plan to follow called a budget or are we going to just have pasly just do what feels good just spur the moment are we going to save for retirement or are we going to just hope that the government helps us cuz I don't want to be relying on the government if I reach retirement age so about do what you don't have to worry about why time for you to die oh yeah and then your health is another thing you seow seeds in your health what food you eat you know they say you are what you eat so uh I figured that out a while back you know Gab after we got married we put on some marriage weight and I started praying and I prayed since then for years now I prayed Lord help us to lose the weight we're designed to lose to eat healthier exercise more and to take better care of these bodies you've blessed us with and I prayed about it for years not really knowing exactly what to do and sister Anna Canard gave me a video a set of videos that did nothing more than just gave me the information of how to eat healthier what to eat what not to eat and and what's wrong with the food that we do eat usually and all the toxins and things in it and I just started eting healthier and drinking water and everybody thinks I'm dying you know cuz I lost much weight everybody's asking me are you okay well yeah just feel better you know and trying to lose weight and just get in better shape but see those are seeds you sew you reap what you sew you are what you eat I used to eat these greasy biscuits in the morning and I feel so bad all day long just cuz all that grease it just felt like I could feel it clogging my arteries almost it felt terrible and I felt awful felt sick the rest of the day but that's the seed you sow and you reap what you sow uh Proverbs 16:7 says he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul and I think there's also a scripture that says that a man should think on his way is there a scripture that says that think on his way I tried to find that one and that's the only one I come up with he that keepeth or guardeth his soul or his way excuse me PR preserveth his soul so these are ways that you these are things we need to think about be continually ongoingly thinking about all these things spiritual walk marriage family career finances Health just to name a few and you seow seeds in each of those things to reap later okay Galatians 6 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap for he that Seth to the flesh to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that Seth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting and let us not be worry in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not so God is Not mocked you can't bypass the system so to speak you can't get around God you can't seow seeds to your flesh and reap life Everlasting you can't get around this it's a law of God and it will come to pass it cannot fail amen and Brother Dean the night the other night preaching about the Rapture that was enlightening to me about a lot of things but in particular I'm going give you a story when I was about 15 that was in the year 2000 or we're switching over from the 99 to 2000 New Year's Eve of 1999 I was a 15-year-old Baptist kid I was standing outside my mom's house where she lives now as I was living there then stood outside and ADM not looking up at the sky waiting for the Eastern Sky to split because look my dad told me every 2,000 years in the Bible there's a major event to take place so I and he said maybe the Lord will come he didn't say he would but maybe the Lord will come in 2000 and so I was literally out there as a 15-year-old Baptist kid standing up there looking up the sky where are you Lord but you know I was standing there looking for him and not having any idea that within a couple years the Lord would bring me to the message and let me begin to see the truth cuz I literally thought you'll laugh at this I thought there was going to be a 50 ton brass trumpet and the sky would split open and this trumpet would lower down from the sky and go like brother Dell says and the whole world would hear this trumpet but the Bible says he's coming as a thief in the night so when a thief comes in the night you think well everybody in the house is in bed asleep so a thief's not going to come up to the door and blow a trumpet that's they're not going to sneak out with anything anything that way they're not going to come in there and Barge the door down and and take things they're going to sneak in unwar when you don't have any idea cuz everyone in the world is asleep they're oblivious to what's going on but there's a little bride that is feeding on the word and the Rapture is beginning to build within them the the rapturing faith is beginning to build within them as they feed upon the word and Brother Dean talked about it and laid it out so beautifully and can't remember exactly how he worded it but just basically that we come to a place and it's not going to be a shock or surprise cuz I always thought like a lot of nominal people think today that once you get saved that's it you're in it's your ticket and whenever you die you go to heaven or if the Rapture comes you'll go and that the Lord is going to literally come and just suck you out of here just in a moment that you'll just be gone just like that and that you're going to planes are going to fall out of the sky and trains are going to be wrecking just absolute um obliteration of everything and you think well that's not a thief in the night cuz everybody's going to know what that's going on that's why this left behind movie and all these things deceive everybody it's an absolute deception because these people are daily living their lives serving the devil and yet because they at one time in their life years ago they accepted the Lord and then now they think that just at a moment they're just going to be sucked out of here just like they're you know involuntarily you know going to be sucked out of here but it takes a bride to sit before the Lord and continually feed upon the word and be growing in Grace and knowledge and come to that point of rapturing faith and it won't be you know a big shock or surprise you know to us but it's a secret catching away and then let's read a few quotes am I getting any louder okay comes and goes it's just not ining I don't know that's okay show us the father and it will suffice it'll satisfies us uh that's preaching 1960 731 you you can take a man that looks like a Christian acts like a Christian but if that man hasn't got the word of God in him if there isn't a germ of life in there the germatize that he will never rise in the resurrection that's right cuz he can't rise there's nothing in there to raise him up again a seed now when you bury a seed you Farmers you take and go out and put your corn plant your corn you don't go out every morning and scratch it up say let's see is it growing anything happening to it no put it back down late the next day you say I want to see if it's getting long or right or scratch it up again in it'll never grow like that well the thing you do with a seed you commit it to the ground cover it up and that's all you can do about it it's up to God to do the rest of it well that's the same way it is with the word of God if you take any Divine promise of God he made in his Bible put it in your heart and water it every day with praises of God that's going to come to pass it'll grow if you don't quit fooling with you you just leave it alone don't say let me see can I move my finger any better today do I feel any better is my headache a little bit better oh no it'll never be that just commit it to God and walk away and leave it alone that's God's seed it'll grow and the same applies to the word of God you plan it and commit it to God don't try to figure it out my biggest problem is I try to figure it out I'm all the time thinking about something I really want to see the truth about something I really want something revealed to me so I'll read about it study about it pray about it and then just sit there and scratch it that seed scratch it up out of the ground but I need to just commit it and just leave it and let God do it and someday I'll be riding along chicken truck or walking along and just it just Quicken just like that totally out of my hands you know I can't I can't Quicken it to myself all I can do is plant it and leave it and don't try to figure it out I'm preaching to me so me yall take that if you if it's for you too uh Fellowship 55813 the reason today that Christianity is about fifth place among the religions when it comes to numbers is because we failed to do what Jesus commands us to do the last words that Jesus Christ gave to his church was go into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature instead of that we have went and taught the Bible Well the gospel doesn't mean the word only Paul said the gospel came not in word only but in power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost the word is a seed but the seed won't grow unless it's placed in the right kind of ground no matter how much seed you've got if you're afraid to sew it afraid to sew afraid see the uh to excuse me the seed will do you no good but listen to this every word of God is a seed Jesus said so and every promise of God will come to pass if you receive it and don't doubt it can place it in your heart and believe it come from God and water with faith it'll spring forth of its kind don't never forget this statement I'll make this from my heart the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass you believe that amen if you'll take the right attitude that it's God's word and God is behind his word and the word is God it'll bring it to pass what it says if you plant wheat you get wheat if you plant corn you get corn if you want to be saved accept his Plan of Salvation if you want to be healed accept his plan of healing here they are he Christ was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we are healed that's all you have to know the next thing you have to do is to believe it and it'll take care of itself Hallelujah it will we've already read Luke 8 there's Luke 8 um I just read verse 15 again but on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart have heard the word and as they have heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience okay we are the field or Earth in which the son of man went forth to seow his seed we only have to make sure we are the right top of field in other words we have to make ourselves available God will do the rest God has a time for everything he wants to accomplish in our lives okay trying to do God a service without being the will of God and uh jeffon 6 5718 in the morning now he Reveals His word only in its season Martin Luther read the same Bible we did he Wesley read the same Bible Martin Luther did Pentecost read the same Bible we read Jesus read the same Bible that the Pharisees read but they had trying to keep the corn in an early stage when it was ripening they failed to see their hour now David has done the same thing right here God Reveals His word in the season and to whom he chooses to reveal it to God chooses who he reveals it to he chose that before the foundation of the world all his doing for forn by him hidden from man he just reveals them as he will and his it is his chosen season his chosen person and he never did choose a party or sect it's a chosen person how he does it okay man's natural tendency carnal tendency is to try to get ahead of God and to help him achieve his will Eve tried to fulfill God's Will and her own way instead of waiting on God to do it his way and in his season believe Sarah tried to do the same by giving Hagar to Abraham to fulfill the promise of God uh getting ahead of God okay all right ministers in the message get ahead of God by trying to find something good or tantilizing or entertaining for the people instead of waiting on God to reveal the word in his season um okay Facebook to me this is the Facebook scripture this is what I call the Facebook scripture but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness now Facebook has its place and I believe there are people in this church that use it for good I Believe TV can be used for good as well as radio internet these things are things that we can use but man uses man uses them in the wrong way and uses Facebook for a lot of profane and vain battling right and that increases unto more ungodliness all right and their word will eat as do as do a canker of whom is H and felus who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection has passed already or saying that Jesus wasn't God before the River Jordan and overthrow the faith of some and nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knowth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity so false doctrines are more popular because they don't have to be lived they are sweet in the mouth but not bitter in the belly if you think about like Jesus wasn't God before the River Jordan that's good in canalizing because that gives people a leg up over the denominations cuz the denominations I say the Baptist I was a Baptist and I believe that Jesus was God the whole time I thought he was born God and he died God but then or that he um but then uh we hear it teach in the message that he wasn't God the whole time that he became God of Riv Jordan and died as just a man and then that gives people in the message they feel good because that I guess because it sets them apart from the people in the world from the denominations and makes them think they know a little bit more than the denomination have but it's nothing that has to be lived it doesn't come down and get where you live and then same thing about most any false Doctrine you name the Seed doctrine that we come with a literal seed of eternal life in Us by our natural birth that makes us feel good but then it doesn't change us it doesn't do anything to to live to take care of this you know carnal being that we are to transform us yes that verse 18 is is present right now where they say that the Saints have raised Old Testament Saints have raised already uhhuh but we know we've been taught that then without us can't be made perfect yeah so it isn't that kind of a body mhm it's not a glorified body like Jesus had cuz he's the only one that has that kind of a body right right yeah and then um and it's like this too I use you know brother R talked about the analogy of the Cherry Pie when you keep eating you eat cherry pie then when you hit a SE you spit it out and keep eating pie and brother Brandon he was a forerunner and he was the first to come out of the denominations of his day and and to come and bring forth this message that we believe so he was preaching to a lot of people that only had seed pie or bony chicken okay and he talked about the Bony chicken if you're eating fried chicken and and you hit a bone spit out the b the bone and keep eating chicken well we don't have an excuse we have a boneless chicken breast here that we can partake of all the time we don't have to eat the Bony chicken so what I'm saying is this if you if you miss church on a Wednesday night and you can't be here and you have the choice to pull up one of these bigname preachers or brother Dell pull up brother Dell you know uh if you and if you if you especially if you know these bigname preachers are into false Doctrine because the thing is those things are tantalizing to the flesh they uh they feel-good doctrines and they're feel-good preachers but you know I think about about this uh Jesus was the Bible says talked about him in Isaiah being having no beauty that we should desire him no form or commonness and you know the message comes forth the word comes forth in that way it's not tantalizing to the flesh but yet it's feeding our soul okay so that's why whenever I I kind of bulk at anything that kind of makes me feel good and makes me uh get goosebumps or something I start thinking well wait a second here is this really right frankly I fall asleep a lot of times upstairs when my soul is being fed my outer body is so bored to death that I'm falling asleep you know I have to really fight and stay awake but yet I want that for my soul that's what I'm trying to say I want to feed my soul so I think you know a lot of people maybe use that as an excuse to say well I'll just eat this bony chicken and just spit out the bones and keep eating the chicken cuz that chicken is so good well we've got some bonus chicken breast here that we can partake of any time uh sin looks good and it looks beautiful too that's another thing about sin about these false doctrines these tantalizing false doctrines they look so good but it doesn't do anything for the inner man all right I know there was more to be said about that but that's all I got now I'm going to refer back to this scripture again uh remember Galatians 6 ver8 for he that Seth to his flesh now that's where the false doctrines sow to the flesh shall let the flesh reap corruption but he that Seth to the spirit shall the spirit reap life Everlasting so seow the seeds to your soul seow the word of God partake of the word that feeds your soul okay now let's see the believer's position in Christ in 1955 January 16th then Moses lost all the hopes let me double check make sure that I need to read all that one let me um yeah better ahe okay God has times for season he has season for his word he has times when the scripture here where it said and the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick that's when Jesus was ministering to and the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick maybe at other times the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick and we find out that God works everything seasonally now when Moses and what he failed to find was the time limit of God figure out what I've got time for time then when God revealed himself to him in the burning bush he found out that when the very that was in The Burning Bush was the thing that he lacked and I think that's a whole lot with us today that many times we tried to do the program ourselves and failed to get what was in the burning bush the direct revelation of the will and time of God what good would it do to plant some corn out here today which this was in January it would rot it'd be nothing would happen if it happened to sprout the cold weather would kill the germ see it wouldn't work we got to have the time SE season for it excuse me all right let me um we must be patient and wait for God to achieve his will and his time patiently endure uh for Hebrews 6 15 I'll just get down to read that one youall read this before because we're running out of time and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise okay patiently enduring waiting on God for his time always be diligent and study the word of God daily even if you don't feel like you're gaining ground just like natural growth in Plants spiritual growth is very slow and cannot be noticed on a day-to-day bases he okay provers 10:4 he becometh poor that deal with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh Rich there's natural and spiritual types to that obviously study to show th second Timothy 2:15 study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth all right our objective again do you see that our duty is to be the right kind of field and SE the right kind of sea today so that God can give the increase tomorrow give me a nod yes okay amen amen then oh the go upstairs like that questions any a question you did very good
