TRANSCRIPT
========================================
wow good morning everyone good morning good morning it's a pleasure to be back in the house of the lord again no i think if we're going to read from psalm 96 1 through 13. now i think every time you know things happen nasa well all these things are fulfilling god's attributes and our predestination so what happened to us is what god seeing was going to happen so just be thankful that we can get through it so we just thank him for his blessing been coming down upon us let's pray heavenly father we are thankful this morning god for the opportunity lord to come together to worship lord we pray that your holy spirit is abiding in each and every heart father let us pray continually lord and thank you for all that you're doing for us and lordosive did long we ask your blessings to be upon us wherever we are lord there are so many people god that never even look unto you never give thanks love but you never leaves anyone alone if they would just hold to you god and let us hold your unchanging hand and have love always in jesus christ and we pray amen i'm going to read from psalm 96 say unto the lord a new song saying unto the lord declare his glory among the heathen his wonders among our for all the people of the nations are ours but the lord made the heavens give unto the lord o ye kindred of the people give unto the lord glory and strength o worship the lord in the beauty of holiness fear before him all the earth let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad let the sea roar and the fullness thereof before the lord here he cometh for he cometh to judge the earth he shall judge the world with righteousness and the people with his truth amen god bless you may be seated amen is that your one of your want to get across the river yes on this side a lot of trouble and heartaches but we cross over there and we'll be all right but to have our visitor with us we always say when you come here one time your visitor you come two times you're part of us because we don't have anything to join or anything like that we're just part of the body of christ so we say to you welcome and just you know try to fellowship with us around what the word of the lord remember now by way of announcements the bible study will be this coming saturday at six o'clock we're still in the book of romans so come and be with us we're having a good time of doing that remember also the valentine band quit is about the 14th right and we're you know the sign up sheet is downstairs so make sure you sign up where we can get everything fixed for the you know the food and things that we have to do and this is for uh the couples only because we're trying to give the sisters a night out to where they can fellowship with all of us and that way we can too fellowship together have a good time doing it so you remember that so just pray that the lord would would bless all of us in that way all right and when brother luis is going to be speaking for us wednesday to try to give us an update of the uh his trip and all down to nicaragua and all and and his interpreting and the fun he had while he was there so that would be good so he'll be the lord willing this coming wednesday i think that's all of the announcements anything else that we tommy duty we call him he's in the hospital did he say what was wrong with him or what he has pneumonia pneumonia all right so let's just make sure we pray for him that the lord would would touch him and it'll be all right all right anything else so that's just saying open the eyes of my heart as wade comes to minister i hope you're enjoying the series i am and and but you know what was that feller said contrary to popular opinion you know he's saying some things i hadn't thought of you know so that's i'm enjoying it you know so that would help us you know i believe it right so let's just pray and ask the lord to open our eyes to the understanding of god's word right open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart lord is that your desire open the i want to see and how do you want to see him to see you high and pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy you love him this morning high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy amen holy holy holy hey man you want to see him this morning that word c means what understand all right we can all see we all got good vision but we need to have some spiritual vision some spiritual insight and uh that way i'd rather see that way than than than to be able to see 10 10 vision in the natural because you'd see things you didn't want to see amen but in the lord there's not anything that you don't want to see of him good to be in the house of the lord good to have our visitor with us today uh brother david right david yes sir good to have you with us today and uh and uh just pray to say something it'll help you any of us in all of us but uh by way of announcements let's we're gonna i hope we spend less time doing this because downstairs is the announcement um board and it runs the whole time you're here so if you're ever sitting or standing or or are down in the fellowship hall it's going to be continually looping telling us all the way to june so we don't have to i don't say waste time but it is kind of when we have a lot of announcements it wastes a little bit of time to to make these announcements where you can look on down on the board and see it but remember next sunday i'll be at brother joe green so i'll give you a break hopefully we'll get to brotherly kindness this afternoon and that'll be that little break and i hope they'll let me continue on maybe even until until i go to the philippines but remember me also 25 days from the day i'll be flying out going to the philippines for three weeks so keep me in your prayers it's not gonna be a short visit it's gonna be for uh a pretty good length of time so just remember in your prayers and um also i know we also have sick ones among us but we got a crowd today we don't uh couldn't fit hardly any more in so we thank the lord for that that god's let us be able to be a part of this amen to be able to be a part of the economy of god to be a part actually not just be a part of the economy of god but be the economy of god all right so let's turn to second peter one and we're going to continue our study today on the statue of a perfect man lord willing we're going to get to godliness and brotherly kindness i hope you enjoyed last sunday that was really i enjoyed last sunday too uh it's bringing out a lot more to me you know like i said brother joe brother uh bob we've been doing this downstairs and he said man you've been holding back i said no it's just god unfolding more as you go along more and more and and to me you know what that is to me that's a confirmation to me may not be to you but it's a confirmation to me that god's bringing you from one place to another if you if you see something here and then you see more of this because you're never going to exhaust god you're never going to come to the place to where you're going to know more than god does but you can know who god is and remember the bible says and he is a rewarder of them that what diligently seek him all right so we got to be diligent about this so second peter chapter 1 verse 1 through 11 and let's pray before we get started just remember the ones in prayer i talked to sister rebecca brother gary's going to try to make it this afternoon he called me tuesday and had a real good day and uh and was testifying of it so we just thank god that that you know he said he would heal us he didn't say he'd do it instantly prayers of the saints we just keep praying okay you pray to that one spot and then you know why it's like brother branham said though you could be healed of cancer and die of cancer a month later but it'd still be god to heal you the first time because satan will never heal you he wants to destroy you so don't you remember one thing for sure if you're ever healed god did it right it does not matter the lord jesus christ took those stripes for you before you even came on the face of this earth right but he knew you'd need it when you got here so let's go to the lord in prayer the heavenly father we pray lord today that you would come among us in a special way as we always say please do not be a bystander lord be an active participant be the one that does the speaking one that does the hearing one that does the listening father and may truly we see you lord may we understand that the day and hour that we're living in requires us to be christians not superhuman but christians to live a good honest christian life and to portray it before others father give us lord our daily bread today be with the ones that are not here the ones that are sick father just continue to bless them may your healing anointing go all the way from the top of their head to the soul their feet father if any be anyone here among us today lord that's sick lord you said that you sent your word and healed them so as the word goes forth father may you quicken it to their heart we can't do anything about that they must accept and let it quicken in their heart that you've already healed them father lord we pray for the missionaries on the foreign fields that you bless them and give them fruit for their labor be with each one today lord just lift us up in spirit and in mind and body lord we asked in jesus name amen second peter verse 1 simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained so there's something you got to get something you got to get god's not going to bring it to you you got to go get it all right remember even john on the isle of patmos and maybe we'll bring some of this together later but john on the isle of pasmos he had to go get that book from the angel right all right he had to go get the book and eat it the angel didn't just no he had wine free moral agency his free moral agencies went and took the book right and he ate it so to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied look at all these adjectives all these words multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness so we've been talking about how to live our life and how to live it godly right all right excuse me through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given all right so he's going to give you something if you diligently seek him he's going to give you something all right we're buyer given unto us exceeding there's another one exceeding great and precious promises that by these what these promises that's what he's talking about by these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature that now not your nature that's right your nature is not divine right there's only one divine nature and that's the nature of almighty god satan does not have a divine nature satan has a nature all right and that nature corrupts you so you got to turn that around by the new birth being partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so you've escaped something right we just read this and go home i mean look at all these blessings but but peter didn't stop at verse four he said and beside this besides all that verse one through four all that stuff god's given us all those things and besides this giving all diligence in other words here you gotta go you gotta go get it again add to your faith your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience into patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity and that word in the bible also is love all right and that is not we'll get to it later but that love has nothing to do with filial love right right exactly let's not feel your love feeling your love is your nature that you're dealing with now everybody got that that's filial love agape love is that love that no man can understand unless you're at that place amen all right for if these things be in you not on you not an anointing it's got to be in you and once it's in you what happens it becomes you that's right exactly or you become it right for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren non-fruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ i was thinking the other day that right there tells you that a christian will never be barren or unfruitful doesn't matter what you go through doesn't matter what you do you will neither be barren nor and fruitful if you will let these things work in your life because look he that lacketh these things is blind now not physically blind but what spiritually blind and cannot see it far off in other words what if what is a far off revelation you can't see revelation okay but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see it far off and have forgotten so he's forgot something right that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren he's summoned it all up give diligence to make your calling not your pastors not your deacons not your elders make your calling an election sure for if if these things be if you do these things you should never follow right right amen you'll be seated in the lord's blessing and reading the word that's the promise ye shall never fall but we want to start now and want a background even with with a visitor here i like the background anyway because we all need to have this refreshed remember 15 times it's got to be repetition so you've heard it about nine so we're almo we're halfway there you can hear it again but remember bring up the first chart for for some the visitor and for all of us to see that what we're talking about today is not a pyramid religion right that's right but the prophet that came in the end time showed us how that it did connect to the building of the pyramid and that we had to grow up in god that this was more of a mountain than it was a pyramid okay uh the sides you know is this should be a mountain everything was given moses would give him the ten commandments on what on a mountain all right all these jesus was transfigured on what a mountain so we see that god brings people up not that he had to put him up there but in symbolics to show me in you we don't have to go on a mountain to get something we don't have to go stone mountain and get on top of the mountain and sit there and wait on god no he's showing us though that what we have to do is though we have to come out from down here this is all normal this is all the world down here you've escaped that and come up higher in god all right so here is the what peter was giving us he was showing us we had to add to your faith virtue to virtue knowledge knowledge temperance temperance patience patience godliness godless brother kindness and the capstone which is love all right because remember just in background and remember we'll not take it off but remember jesus christ was rejected he was the jesus christ the head of all things right all right so he was rejected when they crucified him on a cross and he didn't go away but he says i'm going to leave and he said they're not going to see me anymore but you're going to see me how are you going to see me is is you're going to grow and have the same virtues that i have right right because remember the christians in antioch were called christians because they were christlike okay you can be religious all the day of your life and die and go to hell the devil's very religious he's hugely religious but the devil can never be a christian he can't be christ he can't be christ-like he can get close but he can't be christ-like like me and you there's no way that satan can have these virtues working like they're working in me and you see to me that's the separation that separates everything this this teaching of the statue of perfect man separates these over here from these over here all right excuse me but you have to before you get into this growth with god you must be justified by what believing on the lord jesus christ that he did die for you not for your neighbor not for your brother but he died for you you're walking in this direction all right may take a little time but i'm gonna background a minute here you're walking in this direction you're doing sin you're smoking you're drinking you're you're cursing you're running around with women you have a lustful spirit because remember the scripture says you have escaped that when you become a christian escape the lust of the world all right so you come this way now what you do is one day something either like happened to me you know god will kind of knock you on the head and knock you down for a minute and say look son i need you to do something different you know what i done i got tired of the way i was living i got tired of the way i was living so i i chose to accept what god give me i chose to accept what god give me i didn't choose it because my daddy was a preacher i chose it because i said god i'm tired i'm done if that's you i'm going to do this and i'm going to walk away so you do a 180 justification means turn away from your sin and begin to walk now you don't leave that evil spirit right here you just leave all those past sins right here amen because when you turn the devil's going with you everybody say amen he did with me he actually came a little more closer than he was before because i because remember you get your sins forgiven and you're justified you turn and you begin to walk in a different way not physically but even emotionally spiritually first thing i've done is come to church that's the first thing you need to do at justification you need to start coming to church because you know what at first you were going to bars and you were going to this and your friends loved you because they did this yeah all right well see i have my friends here at church do this and that's why i come here you can put whatever this is you know we act like christians here all right so that's where i want to be i don't want to be in a bar anymore i don't want to be smoking with my buddies i don't want to be you know whatever so i've turned but that evil spirit is still there motivating me to do the same thing again and you know what i might right amen okay if you're a smoker i never was a smoker but i chewed tobacco i was you in the back i was chewing the back of it well now mine was a special case because god knew it'd take a hard time for me to get rid of it but when i turned and started coming back in this direction that part of me not that part went away yeah now a lot of people didn't brother donny he don't mind me using him brother donny he i believe he went through act uh through the process of justification and he started walking you know what he was walking like this though is that okay that's fine okay he's walking like this right now what changed god didn't remember what he did here right that was gone all right so god's not going to remember that you may remember it and i'll guarantee you your friends are definitely going to remember it because you know what they're going to walk with you and remind you yeah but you got but see that's where you got it's still based on faith you got to believe that god did that and that he can do it and that he will do it so you just say they're gone all right my sins are gone all right so but he's still walking but he's getting convicted every time he does anything like that he puts one in his mouth and goes you know the cigarette starts doing like this and then the lighter won't light then you you know you go find another one you know but you know what that's god though taking you through that step okay i don't know why i'm doing this but i'm going this way anyway we got all day all right so we come through justification and we see that god is just that's why it's called justification you're not just right god is just to forgive you and that puts you on a walk of justification then you come up to sanctification where the unclean spirit goes out of the man he quits he takes that thing for the last time and he says god i'm tired of this he throws it down he says i want that out of me i want that desire gone bible says the unclean spirit goes out of a man right all right that's it sanctification that's cleaned up and set aside for service as we talked about before justification is god picking up a glass thanks for reminding me lord i need one of them i'm picking up a glass it's really dirty but you know what you can use it to drink out of but not at this point right so what god does he picks it up all right that's justification he has taken you from one place to another place and he's going to put you in the service so he's going to what he's going to clean that out right you don't like drinking out of a dirty glass do you god don't like using an unclean vessel either so he cleans that out by what the fire of sanctification what coming to church listening to god's word quit listening to other people's word all right start listening to what god says and forget about what because you know what your friends are gonna you know what absolutely what happened to me my friends became religious i said religious not christians they just all came religious you know they became religious so you know you have to watch that and um you know you still have to watch it but you know you get around people and they start cussing then they find out you're a christian and they start you know asking for prayer and you know i prayed for this you know okay whatever that's up to them and god you got your own self to worry about so god cleans that thing out all right so he cleans it out and puts it aside for service he's trying you to make sure that's clean right all right and then when he does he comes in by a new birth not your first birth from your mom and daddy that's what got you over there in that part of this all anyway all right now look your mama day didn't make you smoke or drink you did it yourself yes sir especially in this day and hour you gotta go buy that stuff and it's expensive but when you become born again then god fills that vessel with himself amen all right and then he puts you in service but you've got to have still got to have faith because faith is the new birth and it's faith new birth holy ghost all the same and it's one person it's the person of jesus christ he met you here in justification this is where he met you at but he don't want to just meet with you right he wants to be in you and then we can start doing these right oh many people can have you know have no temper at all that don't mean one thing to god nothing that don't mean nothing to god that you that you can control your temper without being provoked or being provoked or whatever that but remember what did we say temperance was control see that's where god comes in and shows you something else he gives you another revelation because i was talking sister johnny last sunday we never spoke about control downstairs with temperance we talked about temper what to do but remember it's all it's control it's a controlled faith jesus was standing on the bow of the boat all heck was breaking loose his disciples were saying why are you sleeping because and he just said where's your faith peace be still right he was what he but he was training them though to where when he went away and came back as the holy ghost they would be able to do what he did right same thing with you and i but what's happened down through the ages that makes us different than a lot of denominations is that denomination says well the new birth is and puts a slot here it says it's shaking the hand with the preacher or whatever right or the presbyterian says it's this or the pentecostal says you got to speak in tongues no the the real definition of the new birth is that you're born again by the word of god amen and you believe and receive the word of this hour okay because remember if we believe and receive the word of luther not good for this day we can't smoke a pipe and drink a beer he was a german that's what they did but god quickened that justification to him and that was his new birth but now we have to move remember i moved you got to move from that the lutherans sat down and said this is it yeah okay god moved on all right god moved on to sanctification to john wesley and then through the pentecostals brought in the baptism of the holy ghost around the turn of the century and now we've had in this hour we believe we've had a prophet come and try to tie all those loose ends together he took those walls of petition and he moved them out of the way to try to get all denominations to see that you've got to have faith in jesus christ not faith in the baptist faith in the methodist faith in the pentecostal faith in a brand of might right same thing friend of mine religion it's not it's jesus christ that's the basis of everything we're talking about because this was him if you look in the background you see his head this was was that one brother anderson can you pull that one up where he's standing in the middle of all that he can do it he's going to show you how you can do it there you go see that jesus christ is the head of all things and who are we we're his body he has no physical body on this earth except me and you in the spiritual sense all right that we are the spiritual body of jesus christ but you know what we're still a good solid body here all right we're not spirits floating around no we gotta we gotta have this teaching of the statue of perfect man to move us from just spirit into flesh the son of man is the word made flesh well the word can stay there all it can and be dead the word's not dead but the effects that we put on it is dead but if you take that word out though and place it in here then if you become the word made flesh you become as a prophet instead of walking breathing foot of god god don't have a foot down here except yours right god don't have a hand down here except yours all right so that's why we're teaching this statue of a perfect man to show us through these virtues that we can live a christian life and be able to tort the devil and take him and push him aside and say hey you know you don't have anything to do with me i'm a child of god that's right take your greasy hands off of them right that's the authority now to me that's that knowledge of how to use the faith temperance and all that so let's go through real quick sorry that's a little bit of background though that's good though good that we all refresh ourselves a little bit you know you got to know where you come from to know where you're going right all right so if we come from here we have a firm foundation remember i preached one time on feet feet equals redemption all right every time you look at feet you think of redemption well hey right here's your redemption process right here starts at faith faith virtue knowledge temperance and all those things that paul and peter talked about but remember it's a requirement and and power without character you can have the power you remember the seven sons of skeva they saw paul delivering people from demons right now they said we want to do that but they weren't where paul was right all right but they saw what power paul had and possessed and remember even the source simon the sorcerer he wanted to buy it right and then he got real serious but see down inside that's where god's going to look and all of us today down in here is where he knows he knew that simon the sorcerer had had another motive besides being a christian because he wasn't a christian right see the problem with simon a sorcerer he wanted to get way up here first and not start down here he didn't want to start and become a christian give his heart to god and forget all those things that he does all that witchcraft no he wanted to what have power over something right same with the seven sons of skeva they said we adjure thee in the name of jesus christ and you know the devil didn't even bother them a bit you know why because the man was not inside right jesus christ wasn't inside those seven sons and the devil turns and says paul we know jesus we know who are you in other words they were looking for the power without the character and power without character if it's used wrong is satanic all right so now and to show us how we get this is go to ephesians 4. i'm going to read these every time because it's something that we need to see ephesians 4 verse 11. and he gave some this is how peter showed us what we needed paul showed us how to get it all right because if if there's a requirement if peter gave us a requirement which they're required then god's got to make a way god is not a kind of person like me or you or anybody else that would that would give you something so difficult that you couldn't reach it right god's not that way god's got a plan and a purpose and he put that thing out there and he says hey you can get it i'm gonna make the way jesus is what i am the way the truth and the life i'm the door i'm the way to get in it's through jesus christ but it then now remember jesus is not here in the body form right right but he does have people that do what he says all right or has the mind of god and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for what for the perfecting of me and you not just me me and you for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ all right till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man that's what we're talking about statue of perfect man unto the measure now what's measure height growth whatever excuse me to the measure of the stature not a statue we're not a statue statues don't move all right stature is move it's growth development stature of the fullness of christ now let's go to hebrews 5 14 where paul is still peace speaking here he says but look strong meat belongs to them that are full age so god doesn't want us to stay babies listen we all got to start as a baby we all got to start as a baby but he doesn't want i i love deanna six years old i love her the age she is but it would be it would be horrible for me to say god i want to just stay six years old no that would be detrimental to who her same way with god god can't say well i know i like brother dick at that age right there i'm talking about spiritual age i want no that's detrimental to him god doesn't want you to do that he doesn't put a cap on it you do and i'm going to read it to you in just a minute all right excuse me but strong meat belongs to them they're a full age even those who by reason of what use got to use in faith muscles have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil what we talking about in temperance temperance is discern does earn both good and evil because remember we didn't discern good and evil when we were out in the world oh sure we knew we didn't need to murder somebody but we had we still was evil because jesus comes along he says hey you don't have to murder anybody now you just got to talk against them that's right you don't have to commit adultery with that woman you can just look after look at her and lust after and you've done the same thing because remember it's the same that's one word it's all evil right without god all right now hebrews 11 1 we got down to the foundation we spent a little time on that hebrews 11 1 says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen but i told you before you can't take virtue out and show it to somebody like a book or a pencil or whatever but you you let it work its way out and you manifest what that is all right remember remember god i never forget this god does it he reveals it then he has to make it manifest right all right because this is a secret but manifesting it is bringing it out in the open right the evidence of things not seen so now we talked last let's put the foundation chart up there like we were we were looking at a couple sundays ago and we were talking about just a minute ago justification sanctification and you must have faith add to your faith right add to your faith when you become born again that becomes your new birth not somebody else's so it ca it's mine okay it's mine right it's my faith now and god you know what god don't want it back bro god don't want it back he's not anything giver he don't give you or he won't give you a bunch of virtue and then say no god knows what you can handle before you even got here you just don't know it yet all right and that's the journey that we have to take somebody asked brother brown one time said brother i'm saying why do you preach if all this is set and done and settled well they weren't understanding what predestination and foreign knowledge was they were just looking at it as well if if they're going to you know preacher called me the other day and said he had a brother that come there and said well if they're going to be saved they're going to be saved it doesn't matter what you do god knows that but you and that person don't have a clue right amen so let's don't pick them out let god pick them out amen you know present the gospel to them and like i said brother brown says you know you'll see the predestination's off but it's because of what that person decided right you don't decide for them we've done it all before we've wrote them off haven't we well let god do that you just present you know what the life lib is going to show them whether you got it or not and whether they want it because of that thing called virtue amen all right so we have justification sanctification baptism holy ghost puts us into the body gives us faith and then it becomes your faith and you've got to believe that god can finish it because remember the prophet of god said faith alone will not do it now that's pretty outstanding because he based his whole message all 1100 sermons the first message he preached was faith the substance of things hoped for he based everything on faith and then he comes to the statue of perfect man he says faith alone won't do it won't do what won't make you up here faith will only get you in the body you'll be a good christian set in a pew but you're gonna we're gonna do your funeral one day but he's made a way to escape that right all right let's go to quote number one this is one i always like that we're gonna we're gonna read every time because it really refreshes i want to throw it all back on us and you know what he's not talking to you he's talking to us us all of us statue of perfect man 1962. notice you must be born again that's what we've been talking about and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith all right you got to have a belief system you got to have a way to believe that god's already done it he doesn't have to come back and do it he's already done it so it's laying there waiting on you to just get it that's right so you see on my chart here i got the very foundation faith is the foundation of all of it scroll it up don't happen we'll just read the blue to save time you're possessed of one because you're either that's either faith or doubt you you've either got faith or doubt in your soul see now you can have faith and doubt in here don't get me wrong every day we because remember you got to have knowledge to discern what's right and wrong all right but inside you is either right or wrong that man that motivates you down in that control tower he's either faith or doubt not both all right that's the soul of man all right that's why you're very special to god because you're the only one that's got a soul that's close to him right you understand what i'm saying you got a soul god's the soul you got a soul but the dogs and the animals they don't have a soul so you are special to god but see remember they can't make a choice that soul in there gives you that choice between faith or doubt all right you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much faith you have is how high you can rise all right so we're putting he's putting it back on each one of us that ever half how you you know well i can't get rid of my temper you know what you're saying i don't want to get rid of it you like that thing you pet that devil you know what brother brown said about that woman at the dance hall remember he cast the demon out of her she walks by said she petted that devil and went into that back in that dance hall and came right back on her why because she want she there was a part of her that still wanted that part of that life and you can't have that first you got to have faith and then you talk about staying on that foundation but we must have a belief or a conviction we must be convinced that this is what it is christianity is the only way for us out of here there's no secondary there's no third there's no fourth choice one choice right that's either faith or doubt you're either going to believe or you're not going to believe all right so let's go to virtue now we talked about virtue now we're going to talk about as we were talking about virtue faith all right let's go to the chart because remember you never leave that foundation stay on that foundation you must stay right here and then as you're growing gone god gives you virtue faith and that's a faith that somebody else can pull from all right because remember faith alone won't do it faith alone will help you but aren't we here to help others all right so we must have virtue faith or strength or what they said you know we were talking about the word dunamis the word dunamis is power strength and jesus said in mark 5 verse 30 let's go to that one we'll hurry right through these because we've already been through them before but i just wanted you to kind of refresh your memory strength strong faith all right mark 5 verse 30. you did that not put it in there got it okay that's that's virtue look let's look at the at the definition strength or power or ability inherent power right in other words you don't have it you inherited it right you must develop this power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature or which a person or thing exerts are put forth powerful performing miracles moral power and excellence of soul so we just don't have faith anymore to believe we have a virtue faith or a strong faith that in that we can like we said many times before if you if if somebody writes you a check and it bounces we bounce one in our life that early and early on and we don't you know we just don't do that because morally it's not right because it says right here it says moral power all right you got to have some control there but the virtue well if we kept going but what if we kept going to a place and they kept writing me a bad check i'm not going to do any business with them anymore i'm not one time and that's it but you know what god's the same way what if brother donny comes to me and says pray for me but then i pray for him and i go out and he sees me out there at the bar with a drink in my hand and a cigarette now how much virtue can he bring from that you know what it does it puts a doubt in his mind i'm picking on you today you're just tall and just your head sticks up other than bigger than anybody else's it's really it's really white looking so i can see it but really i mean is that truth how can you draw virtue from that how can you draw virtue from from brother dale if he comes up here and preaches and then he says well i'll see y'all this afternoon and then we get here at two o'clock and we have a song service and we call the preacher out and we called the preacher out that's the word brother dale well he decided to go you know he decided to go down to bass pro and look around a little bit now how much virtue would you draw from that zero same way with our life to me when you've got faith when you come up to virtue that's a strength that others can draw from you're the only one who knows whether you got it or not okay but others should be able to see that you have it and then want more remember we were talking about the foolish virgin why does the foolish virgin come to the wise virgin because they got something that the foolish virgin doesn't have and it's a drawing effect or a power they have enough faith enough faith till they know you got it so they're going to come and get it from you why would they go get it from somebody that didn't have it all right same way that's what virtue is virtue is a faith or a strength a strong faith jesus immediately knowing himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes now this was the woman that touched him they had the blood issue all she done is when he walked by she just touched him of his garment and strength went from him and virtue had to be in it to go out but what she drew from she drew from that virtue and she said if i could but touch the hem of his garment i could but touch i'll i'll be made whole so she was confessing what she done before she did it then when it happened then she drew virtue or strength from that opportunity same way with you and i same wish why we lay hands on the sick that's why you see brother dale sometimes he'll just kind of pat you on the back or or if your back's hurting or something he'll patch you right here or you know you don't know what's going to happen it's happened many times before right right where you just don't you don't even have to pray for him you're praying inside yourself well what is that that's a virtue strength that's the strength that you have that you can give to others and you know what they can draw from that that's the same way with all of us drawing together all right so let's go to acts 1 verse 2. now this word but you shall receive power now that word power is converted to dunamis which is converted to virtue but you shall receive virtue after see what that is now you've got to get the holy ghost first right after the holy ghost has come upon you ain't that good bob nobody's smiling i like that but you shall receive virtue because that power is dunamis which dunamis is virtue same thing when when when the virtue left jesus that word virtue and that word power means the same thing in the greek all right but you shall receive virtue after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses so somebody's going to know that all right so let's go to the second quote statue of a perfect man he's talking about the book of luke verse you went out of him now to be like jesus well i'm going to be like jesus i've got to have virtue and a past that it can pass forward from me to the people right right that's the whole deal with all these virtues sure you can have enough for yourself but god doesn't want you to keep them he wants you to give them to somebody else that's why brother dale studies all the time what he does he gets the knowledge of god paul said we have the mind of christ somebody has to get it first apostles prophets pastors teaching spanish has to get it first and then what god does god passes it down through that person to you well now here you got you know 85 or so 90 people sitting here from one person should be flowing to where each one of you should get something from god you're not going to all get the same thing right amen but it's a pass and brother branham you know he he was a he was the trumpet he was the one that sounded the message then we take that message and we sound it to the people all right but it can't be different remember uncertain sound you can't have an uncertain sound right all right you can't be toot and retreat when you should be charging big mess up there somewhere all right so you got what you got to do though is you got to have the next one which is knowledge all right let's go to knowledge because that's the discernment part you got to discern good from bad all right let's go to the next one which is knowledge and it's knowledge faith on the chart all right but we're going to define it knowledge signifies in general intelligence understanding not just not just smarts up here all right that smart's got to come down through the filter amen you have it up here you we've listened to many false doctrines once we drop it through that filter though we discern whether it's right or wrong because sometimes you'll hear it up here and you think man that sounds good but running through the filter and you'll see that there's a little something off there the general knowledge of christian religion the deeper more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion such as belongs to the more advanced what paul says said let's don't be babies let's grow up all right such as belongs to the more advanced especially of things lawful and unlawful for christians moral wisdom such as seen in right living all right so we that word there was what discernment we looked at that discernment and it's required of a christian it's required every day that you deserve right every day you must discern good and evil what you should do and what you shouldn't do and hey listen we get trapped in satan's trap we're not immune right we get trapped but you know what there's an advocate there that stands up and says i've already took that right amen i've already took all that and i put it behind me he said i can't remember it that's why you know brother dale's talking about god with amnesia what about something you and i did it the other day uh something came to my mind and i thought well lord i just shouldn't know forgive me that was back when i was a sinner and i'm sure he's sitting up here going what are you talking about what are you talking about what are you talking about you know the song what are you talking about my sins what are you talking about those that listen you should never ask forgiveness for those things you already asked forgiveness for right because you know what you're doing satan's bringing it right back and the best thing to do is is not say forgive me lord why he's already forgive you if you've already asked now if you hadn't he may be bringing something that may be god bringing something to you but if satan keeps bringing this junk to you just keep pushing it off you say god you know i didn't do that but he has knowledge to discern man this thing right here it's a devil's playground but it's also the only way god can get to you amen so you got to use that filter of knowledge knowledge faith and faith is what wisdom wisdom is the ability to think and act using knowledge experience understanding common sense and insight i like that word insight it's not just regular site it's insight something you got to look into let's look at the quote here number four skip three just go to four we'll save some time here we're not to get to we're not going to get all this the revelation of jesus christ church age book bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real see that's what man's done man's put their ordinary ideas to it and said matthew 28 19 now jesus said i'm going to take what jesus said jesus said baptize name father son holy ghost well now peter comes up on the day of pentecost he's got the keys to the kingdom jesus told him himself now how confused could jesus be if he told peter he said peter whatever you say down here i'll say up there whatever you close up there i'll close down here and then peter comes up on the day of pentecost and said be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ acts 2 38. now jesus is not that confused god's not that confused that was god in human flesh so he don't make mistakes but what do you do he hid it from the people he said in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost now father's not her name son is not a name holy ghost is not a name so we had to have some spiritual insight to see that that's exactly what jesus was saying on paper right but when peter comes up on the day of pentecost jesus is not up in heaven going no peter no no no no pop stop stop stop don't say that no when he clicks that when he says be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he turned that key and jesus said that's it that's my boy he knew what i was talking about because i said name and father another name sons know the name but you know what lord jesus christ is the name all right so peter picks that up and peter says this is the way it is repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins right and you shall receive what the gift of the holy ghost it's going to take the operation of the holy ghost that means this book now what'd you talk about the bible this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people right it will take one with prophetic insight or knowledge or knowledge faith all right it will require the ability to hear from god got to have a channel there how you going to hear from god apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelists amen all right can't do away with those five offices that where this comes down through it will require the ability to hear from god it will require supernatural instruction not just a student companion verse with verse though that is good and it's good to compare verse to verse but if you compare matthew 28 19 with acts 2 38 you're looking on paper at a controversy i said on a paper at a controversy right but it's not peter's saying exactly what jesus said all right same thing because what is the name of the father the lord son is jesus lord jesus christ father son holy ghost holy ghost is the christ it was back two thousand years i mean that was back before the world all right same man amen it will require supernatural you see how that little that little doctrine of father son holy ghost has swerved everybody over to the side and here's god over here going wait a minute i never said that listen to what peter said peter's my apostle prophet pastor teacher and evangelist this is how you're going to get it you need to listen to peter it will require the ability to hear from god it requires supernatural instruction not just a student companion verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and what no what's that what's the first four letters of knowledge no right all right so you got to have knowledge our knowledge faith all right so then and the next one now is temperance we're stacking them right on top of each other got to have virtue got to have knowledge now we've got to have what temperance faith not just regular faith it's going to be temperance faith all right which is what it's a controlled faith all right right bless my soul with self-control brother branham was was singing there on the statue of perfect man but remember a controlled faith is like jesus with all the demons now listen the demon did i mean when jesus walked up to the the man called legion which legion is what thousands right right so he had that many demons in him that's a lot right but jesus saw a man and had compassion on a man but now what happened was the first thing what did those demons do they recognized who that was why thou son of god why do you come and deal with us in other words before our time right they knew more than the religious people of the world knew the pharisees and sadducees called him a devil the devil called him god you know why because there was a spirit fight in the spirit right right it was a spiritual warfare going on because legion probably looked at the man and didn't say anything the demons spoke out of him and said why have you thou son of god so they identified who he was thou son of god why did you come before your time before our time in other words judgment to deal with us and you know what jesus didn't bicker back and forth with him he wasn't like the seven sons of skiva he wasn't worried about them coming back on him because they honored who he was thou son of god so they put him in his position but he put them in their position you know what he didn't go over there and scream and slap him around he they said can we leave i like a demon when he asks something can we leave and he said go resist the devil and he will what walk away from you he said flee from you boy that's a powerful little statement there we just don't use it enough everybody all right but jesus with the demons and then remember the storm there was that controlled faith that was faith where jesus didn't look at the circumstances because remember jesus walking on the water he wasn't worried about sinking but when peter lost sight and i saw one of those things the other day too and i want to go up there to that bumper sticker and put peter did you know though some bumper stickers says jesus walked on water you know how about you or or you know he's the only one that walked on you think you're perfect jesus is the only one who walked on water no he didn't peter got out of the boat got into the water and did not sink right but peter didn't have a substance faith at that time right he was drawing virtue off of god or jesus christ right so he was looking but brother brown said when he looked at the circumstances in other words what peter done is what we should do all the time is don't deal with the circumstances just say okay god you said so no what he done is he said okay god you said so oh um i'm not supposed to do this um and you know what what happened he sank but remember jesus brought him back out but jesus had a controlled faith and that's what we all should look for as a controlled faith uh and not just and really we you know brother branham never said i can't read where he said get rid of your temper he says control your ungodly temper all right because listen we get frustrated a lot of times once in a while once in the morning while in the afternoon but remember in the world our frustrations would lead to anger amen our frustrations would lead to anger but now we can be frustrated about different things and that's okay that's the humanity part of us all right but you don't let because remember if you have controlled faith that control faith comes up and says that's enough stop right here don't do that anymore you know you shouldn't do that you know you shouldn't be thinking about that person did it run you off the road sister johnny she's from new york she gets a free pass with traffic problems he's i couldn't live up there either i did it it worked my temperance and patience and knowledge and all that stuff to have to deal with that traffic but no we don't ever get a free pass we got to go through it to see that god's give it to us we cannot sit at home and get these virtues and it be a flowery bed of ease this is not forks and spoons this is knives guns shields armor whatever you got you know what if god if satan brother brown said satan's gonna turn every gun on you right right now god's not going to let him kill you so he's going to give you something to protect when he does turn he's going to give you something you know what you got to believe that you already got it not that you got to go get it this is development brothers and sisters this is development we're not going to get it overnight we've got to develop into these things right but that temperance faith to me is sure it's controlling your ungodly temper brother brown says in the blasphemous name but he also said control it's a controlled faith where you're that's what brother billy paul he was so amazed with brother branham when he stood in the audience of several thousand people he said i take every spirit in here under my what control he had temperance faith he had that control where he could control everything that was going on but you know what it come from god almighty that was in him right amen so there's your controlled faith and that's the same thing with you and i like like i told you about what what happened to the prophet he walks into the house and his wife's crying and his kids are fighting and all you know all heck's breaking loose and first thing he does he puts on an apron puts on a holy ghost apron and he walks in there and says honey and he says i'm praying for her the whole time he's rubbing her back you know and said how about that dress you know he's not quoting the scripture now bless god's sister you're supposed to be no he said you remember that dress that i was looking at yeah let's go look at it she says we ain't got time to go look at that dress he said about 10 minutes later she's wanting to go look at the dress well i've told y'all many times if you want if you want to if you want to be close to your wife you ain't got to go buy no sexy outfit get you a washcloth get you a spray bottle with windex a broom and a mop watch what happens watch what happens it won't cost you a dime just maybe a little bit of a sweat sometimes we need that but let's look at what brother ryan said about quote number five we may have to do godliness and brother kindness this afternoon if that's all right because look temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here either no no temperance doesn't mean alcohol is cure because see we're we're not this is not like i've always said before when you come in here and and you become a christian it's not it's not rehab no it's not rehab right it's release it's not rehab because i know i know people that are in that are in alcoholics anonymous they just suppress that demon they have no way to get it out right you can't talk never brother branham you can't talk to them demons that's right you especially can't talk to them if the guy that's talking to him has got a demon so they're just talking back and forth but if you take and come here though we believe in deliverance which is not that temperance see brother brown many people would probably say well he looks at temperance is quitting drinking and all these things but no it's look that's just one of the lusts of the flesh so he's not dealing with the flesh guy if you ever get the soul of the man changed right amen you don't have to worry about him drinking and smoking because remember that all supposed to go out of sanctification that's just one of the lusts of the flesh but we're talking about holy spirit temperance that means how to control your tongue not be a toddler how to control your temper not fall off every time anybody speaks cross to you and then we went on and developed a little bit more we won't read the other ones let's go now last week we were talking about patience so let's talk about patience because patience patience and temperance to me goes together real close all right you gotta have you gotta first have temperance though because remember tribulation worketh patience so listen to try your patience you're going to have to have all these and rely on them to have this okay you're going to have these to rely you got to rely on these because brother brown said you can't skip one so they got to come up the way they are you can't skip one if you do this whole thing crumbles and he said it all falls down right same way with building a five-story building one two three four five you can't start on ground floor and then build i'm going your plans next is let's build level two before we build level one no way you can do that all right same way with god right look how these stack on top of each other you gotta have virtue faith you gotta have strength you gotta have knowledge to know good and evil or good or bad or whichever temperance faith you must have tempers to control the faith that you have all right and control all these other things that you have that come against you because we're really we're dealing we're not dealing with the soul of man here except down here by either faith or doubt right right we're dealing with the second realm the memory reason conscious affection imagination that's where all this right here works in okay because you do have the patience of god you do have a part of patience when you receive the new birth but god doesn't want remember brother said faith alone doesn't do it what foundation faith alone doesn't do it you got to have a patience faith all right now what do you say about patience faith look at luke 21 19. in your patience possess ye your soul that's right the word patience means steadfastness constancy not all this up and down stuff all right endurance paul said we're going to run this race and we're going to finish it all right right in the new testament the characteristics of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently and steadfastly a patient steadfast waiting for a patient enduring sustaining perseverance so we brought out that word last sunday if you'll remember enduring so you must have that patience faith or an enduring faith that you don't just lay it on the shelf on sunday and pick it back up on saturday evening right well i got patience when i'm around the people well they ain't gonna give you patience it's when you have to deal with all them kooks easy around here that's why i said here it's easy to live like a christian when you get into the you get into the dome of the spirit of god and you know that this building's been dedicated to god and we know the word's been preached and it's been hit heard and it's being taught and it's been everything's correct and the way it should go sure easy to have patience easy to have virtue he didn't have nothing yeah it really is right but monday morning when your feet hit the floor are you still going to have that same patience faith as you had well if you're enduring you will but you know what you're not going to be enduring if monday you get up and you go and you see a white dove fly through your bedroom and your kids do everything you tell them to do and there's zero traffic on the road going to work and when you get to work your boss says i'm giving you a ten thousand dollar raise you know what's going to happen at that time the alarm clock's gonna go off and you're gonna wake up right are your wife gonna go hey wake up you're mumbling stupid stuff when you wake up and then reality strikes god get we laugh a little bit god give us a provision to get through that though he give us our backpack our provision is full of things to get through that what you and i have to do is we have to reach back there and use what we got sunday and wednesday and the times we're praying and the times we're studying we got to reach and get that sword and be able to use it that's why i want excuse me us to see that that scripture says there in peter it says exercise you've got to exercise your faith not but hebrews you got to exercise your faith it's got to be exercise all right exercise is good for you especially your faith and how you're going to exercise your faith without going through something right amen i mean sometimes you say lord are you just pouring it on me today no there's somebody else getting it just like you but you know what some of us are a little more stubborn than others so we have to go through them several times romans 5 verse 1 through 4 therefore being justified by faith that's what we're talking about at the beginning justified by white faith you got to believe we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith so there's the access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god and not only so but we glory in we wait a minute you missed that part wait what glory and tribulation also this is good but this is better yeah knowing knowing see there you go go back you got to have what you got to have knowing right now that ain't just knowing physically that's knowing that's that anchor down in here all right without it we go wild but when we got that anchor knowing that god told us this knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope amen so it builds all on patience all right let's go to hebrews 10 verse 36. for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of god not before after ye have done the will of god ye might receive what the promise amen the promise is a body change if you'll understand it in that way now you can say that receive the promise is eternal life that's okay but you've got to have eternal life for you have a body change right so we got to have these things lined up now in james verse 1 my brethren count it all everybody say that word joy when you fall i don't mean fall i don't mean backslide but when you fall into many temptations knowing this there you go back to knowledge again knowing this that the trying of god's faith worketh oh what does that say yours you haven't left of your faith yet have you you got to still have your faith to come all the way up here knowing this that the trying of your faith work its patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be white perfect and entire wanting nothing what a promise now what did brother brown say let's go to quote number nine wow sorry to take so long but we'll just do godliness and brotherly kindness this afternoon all right look the holy spirit will make every movement like christ what it takes to what it takes to make a christian life it'll make you christ light the fruits of the spirits love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience and faith these things are what the holy spirit controls our emotions that's right that's remember that's the filter that's the memory reason conscious affection imagination that's emotion all right because remember and i don't know that we got it here but remember when jesus maybe we do remember when jesus sat down and read the scrolls the greatest anointing right okay that wasn't it was not emotional but it came from the very emotion of god when he spoke point it says precious words came from his lips our emotions is not so much as jumping up and down you could do that a shin dig will bring that to you remember we tried to explain what a shin dig is a hoe down or a hee haw or whatever that is but look it doesn't take that a shin dig will bring that to you that's why you see the people out in the world get emotional satan's emotional satan's an emotional person he loves music he was he was you know brother rhymes he was god's uh song leader there before time i mean he's very he's very emotional and if all they do in the world is when they go to these concerts and you know pitch a fit what is that it's an emotion that they're doing but it's an emotion towards satan not a motion toward god all right god doesn't need all that build up to get his emotion out all right that's what pentecost done he got everybody emotional but brother brown said you better be able when you fall and walk out the door in other words on monday morning you better be able to walk the same way you did when you was jumping up and down shouting in the church like i said it's easy to shout here what about monday afternoon is it easy to shout monday afternoon just at your children than your wife that you walk in peace and love and joy with long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience you see it isn't something that you do it's something the holy spirit does in you because like i said this is not alcoholics anonymous this is not this is not mind over matter okay you see it's no longer an intellectual thought of your own it's a subconscious moving of the holy spirit oh i wish i could shout the praises of god around the world to that many times i've told you before i've been i was on the phone not saying anything about where i was but i know where god took me to is talking to a friend of mine and you know i used to use that word aws a lot i wasn't talking about a donkey either and i was talking on the phone and i was going to say that word that word was in my brain this was just you know young christian but i didn't say those words anymore but it was coming out and it felt like somebody took have you ever been hit right here in the sternum you know people you play football you've been hit right here what knocks the breath out of you right well something just i was on the phone driving down through there and i was talking to him and i said well he was just a something and i was going to say that word and it just went something went just like somebody punched me right just you know didn't hurt me really just punched no air went out of my went out of my lungs and he said what was that i said well i was going to say that word i used to say a lot and i said lord wouldn't let me say it no more so i i knew then that that part of me was over i didn't have to worry about you know that word slipping out or anything like that you gotta i mean you know what god will give you that to show you whether you have or have it because if i hadn't i'd had to took that over again that would have been a do-over another class i'd have to took right because if you're a child of god you're going to have to come to these things amen all right he don't just leave your hand and say well forget him no he he's he's still the school master until he becomes the tutor and then the tutor is the one that teaches you right all right let's go to the next one let's read these and then we'll stop right here what do you say the first thing patience with what what kind of patience first thing is have patience with god right if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because faith worketh patience when god says anything you believe it matthew 28 19 acts 2 38 i believe that's what god said amen god said to be baptized in his name so i'm going to be baptized the name of lord jesus christ amen according to scripture all right so i believe that i don't just believe it i know that's what it is because you come to a belief and like i said before i believe that hannah's coming my daughter i believe she's coming but i've got to see her as she's here now if she's sitting on the front row praising god living a good christian life i don't have to have faith for that it's happened i gotta have for faith for something i can't see amen because if you can see it it's already happened right does it reveals it makes it manifest all right he's in that process all the way through so the same way with your children you say well what about what about god's had patience with you for how many years one more time god has patience with you for how many years amen you know what when you get to glory he's not going to ask you why it took you so long to be a christian no he's not going to ask you that when you when god says anything you believe it that's all you got patience well i asked him last night to heal me and i'm just as sick this morning oh my what patience god told abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one sign actually it was worse he was still believing he was patient with god put him always before you let him be the next crossing thing you understand what that means he said put god out here and when you come to that put god right here and when you come to that crossing thing you put god right here you keep putting god out in front of you knowing that he's going to do it all right so let's look at the next one number 11. but look people there's no way to have patience but by trials all right to have godly patience you've got to have trials all right same uh statue of perfect man and we should have patience with one another all right we get we get so much impatient with one another we think we got to be like moses moses had patience with people look that's what caused them not to go over remember moses got emotional right he didn't do what god said right he smote the rock instead of speaking to the rock you know why because he got mad at them people that was behind him right but he didn't have the holy ghost to control that like you and i have the holy ghost to control that right same way with elijah and allah or elisha elisha would have never called those she bears on to those children if he would have had these virtues in his life all right but god was anointing him at the time to be a prophet in the old testament and that control tower had not went down in the inside yet everybody understand that okay that's why that's why the ones in the old testament can do things that we see that seems like it was wrong and it is wrong but god was showing him for examples like david having his best friend killed well now if you do that now you're going to hell if you don't repent but david had a repentant heart but he didn't have the new birth that new birth would have changed that man he would have never looked at bathsheba the way he looked at her if he had a new birth he would have turned his head away from it he would have loved uriah and everything would have been fine but for examples for an example it's what the bible gives us for in the old testament give us examples these examples are for us to live by all right so we know that david was anointed by god but when the anointing came off david he was just a normal human man just like the rest of us had desires and things like that so that caused him to do what he did but these are to control us now because we're required to come to a body chain but we're first required to come to adoption right all right to become in the line of adoption first you got to get in the family all right that's down at the bottom get in the family all right now once in the family god can raise you up with what faith you have what he said with what faith you have all right and with the faith that you have he will honor that faith because look to me this is faith this is faith and this is the apex of faith so you don't lose this is the apex of faith you are so believing all this is already in your life so god comes down and honors that we'll get into that you know couple services from now on the adoption of the headstone but we should have patience with one another let me finish real quick see that each member of the tabernacle become this i've tried to get this message over at the tabernacle to see that each member of the tabernacle becomes this it's hard to do i've tried to have patience in other words for 33 years he's been trying to preach that sermon for 33 years he's been trying to preach that sermon to the tabernacle to get him into place but he said see have patience right women still bob the hair still just the same but just have patience just have patience wait have to if you ain't got it don't try to build on this down here you must have patience and like i said there's no way to have patience no way to have patience but by trials all right let's stop right there and we'll uh well let's read this one i like this one too let's read it and then we'll everybody let's stand musicians come when you've done all you can do to stand then stand see just stand how am i gonna do it stand he said it's the truth and it's the truth he said it'll happen but now brother jones or so-and-so said it didn't no you just keep going he said it'll happen how i don't know but it will happen he said so he promised it if he promised it it's going to happen that's all it can't waste you see that word said it can't waste you know what that means god doesn't have wasteful movement you and i have wasteful movement we'll have one thought about building a house over here and 10 minutes later we'll change it we'll have a thought about putting this over here 10 minutes later we'll change it now god thought of this before the foundation of the world right and he ain't going to change it glory you can go and do that let's sing a song then lord bless you we'll be in the godliness and brotherly kindness this afternoon sorry i no i'm not sorry what so what should happen i'm not sorry forgive me lord i'm not sorry about that but you love the lord let's sing a song 88 88 page 88 in a spiral book may sweep all the wild stormy deep but in jesus i'm safe ever more i want to be forgiven from strength till i heard a sweet voice say make me your choice and i entered and i'll stormy to his tender embrace and faith taking hold of the word i is since the lord made me whole of jesus who says is in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask to touch our brother's body that they'll not have to do anything to it lord thank you lord god and that you'll make him completely whole father right we believe with our brother in jesus name thank you amen believe it man i listen if we can't put our faith in what we believe we need to go find us another place to believe we need to believe that god's here to do what he said he'd do but the only way to have this rest is to have that holy ghost in that soul let's sing it to him the tempest may sweep all the wild
