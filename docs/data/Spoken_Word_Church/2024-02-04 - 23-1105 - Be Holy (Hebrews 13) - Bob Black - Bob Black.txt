========================================

God bless you Saints it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning we'll just continue on our little study in Hebrews 13 we almost almost made it to the end but there's still some weighty scriptures there at the in that in that chapter that we um I'm looking forward to covering let's just bow our heads before we before we get into the study Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word I pray Lord that your bless today Lord as we come with expecting hearts Lord Jesus to receive from you granted Lord that you'll guide us through this study of your word Lord and pray Lord that you'll just be with brother Wade as he's preparing Lord and help our hearts today we pray in your name amen now as we get through um Hebrews 13 about verses four and five and and so on um Paul's kind of moving into uh where he's just kind of he all through that that last chapter he's just kind of hitting on this thing and then this thing and just kind of moving through pretty rapidly different little topics but one thing he's talking about in verses five and six and and so forth is is to the concept of being holy and so I just want to read a few scriptures from Leviticus and 1 Peter where um God is telling us in Leviticus he said in n in chapter 19 that ye shall be holy for I the Lord your God am Holy so I I believe as we meditate on these scriptures God is God is expressing to us that he wants us to to not just just uh come to church and stay as we are but he's going to change us and to to to be like him and so uh I I thank God that he set it up that way that we he can take us from being unclean and clean us up so that our life is changed in Leviticus chapter 20 he said sanctify yourselves therefore and be ye holy for I am the Lord your God and in First Peter he said but uh Peter's telling us but as he which hath called you as holy so be holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be holy for I am Holy so God don't want us to have unclean conversation unclean lives he wants to clean us up so that we can live right and do right and be an example to others so that when people see our lives they say well there's a real true Christian so let's start meditating on Hebrews 13 in verse one it says let Brotherly Love continue and we've already kind of studied on that a little bit in verse two be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares and verse three remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body and verse four where we start getting into Holiness marriage is Honorable in all and the bed undefiled but wh mongers and adulterers God will judge now you think about how in the in the beginning that God set up this this pattern of of a man and a woman that that God set up this pattern where you he doesn't want you to go through life alone that he set it up so that you'd have somebody to go through life with that there's nothing wrong with that situation that scenario but there is something wrong when God when the Devil comes and perverts that situation and and makes somebody live an unclean life so God has called us to live a holy life he's he's put parameters around the way that we we're supposed to be living and conducting ourselves so that you know there's things that you can do when you're married that you can't do when you're not married because listen God wants to live he wants us to live at a holy separated set aart life where we're living in a way that we really demonstrate what a what a Christian is supposed to look like now uh in Galatians chapter chapter 5 Paul said now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness and in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 Paul's telling us know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor feminite nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous and we'll look at covetousness in a second because Paul's getting to that in the next in the next verse nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God now look at the class he's putting that in if you're living an unclean life where you're doing things that you know you shouldn't be doing that are contrary to the word of God uh living outside the bounds that God has put for us then you you've got a promise here in the Bible that the kingdom of God is not for you but then he says and such were some of you but you are washed you've been cleaned up made holy you are Sanctified if if God has got a hold of your life if God has grabbed a hold of if you've yielded yourself to the word but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of God of our God and of course you know use word to study out justification Justified means you look at you and say well what what you can't find anything wrong Justified means you're you've been made just because you put your trust in what Jesus Christ has done for you and he's cleaned you up now brother R said in the pergamum church age he said so balam got Israel to commit fornication do you know that physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion I said that the spirit of fornication the spirit of organization and all fornicators will have their place in the Lake of Fire now you see what we're doing this morning as we're study we're going through verse by verse it's not anything that I picked out to Target anything but the word is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of it it deser It Go Goes Forth and it'll it'll convict where somebody needs to be convict and you see it's not me this is really really the technical term for this is ex aesus where you go through verse by verse and you let the script RT explain itself and the word will convict a heart so maybe this morning there's somebody that needs to sit in here this morning that ain't quite living right and it's up to you who who that might be but the word will go forth and and it'll convict and you begin to the word if you'll yield yourself to it the word will begin to shape your life and shape the way you think and you'll begin to come come to God and God can clean you up but now see there's there's the mystery of the under the first seal is that the Holy Ghost can drive that unclean Spirit out and clean you up and that is the recipe for getting rid of your iniquity what you need is the holy ghost in your life and that will make you clean that will clean you up and sanctify you and make you holy right and John John MacArthur I just got some quotes here about living a holy life he said this is a nation so far down in the sewer of immortality and in wickedness that nothing surprises me and Billy Graham said regardless of what society says we can't go on much longer longer in the sea of immorality without judgment coming you think about the whole world is is is just uh gone into filth and and and horribleness 1 Corinthians chapter 6 says flee from sexual immorality every other sin a person commits is outside the body but the sexual sexually immoral person sins against his own body and Paul goes on to explain that if you go read in 1 Corinthians 6 because that that kind of that that kind of sin you're joining yourself to another another body when two bodies are joined together you become one flesh in 1 Corinthians 6:15 he said know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an Harlot God forbid CU you got that law that that that U that according to the scripture you two two bodies coming together and I know I'm speaking a little bit frankly this morning for sun for Sunday school maybe but it become two bodies become one flesh in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 it says for this is the will of God now think about this the will of God is for you to live a holy and clean life right God does not want you to sit in church for 10 20 years and be going home and looking at stuff on the internet that you're not supposed to be looking and lusting after things that you're not supposed to be he wants that's the the will of God is for God to clean you up the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor God wants you to know how to how to possess your spirit to keep your body under subjection to turn your eye when something uh walks walks in front of your path he said not in the lust of concupiscence that's that word that means that uncontrolled urge that like like y'all know even as the Gentiles which know not God that no man go beyond and defraud his brother than any matter because that the Lord is the Avengers of all such as Al as we also have forewarned you and testified for God hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto Holiness God wants a holy cleaned up church and he's going to have a spotless bride a bride without any spot without any wrinkle that's the kind of bride that's God that God is going to have and Ephesians chapter 5 he said but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh Saints now now let it not be once named among you means don't don't even joke about it don't talk about it with your you know joking around in the parking lot just leave it over to the side just all that unclean conversation now look what Paul's saying neither filthiness filthy jokes have no place in a Christian's conversation nor foolish talking nor jesting now that kind of jesting is not the jesting like you know why we're just we you know we we like to have fun but that's not what Paul's talking about he's saying the word that word in Greek means is Utopia which means that w a word play that is clever but also potentially suggestive or offensive you're saying something that sound uh there's like that underlying meaning that's that's a little bit filthy that that joke that a Christian don't have no business telling because you know somebody over hear it and you're like that sounds like that sounds like a worldly person's joke neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks for this you know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor Covetous man who is an idolator hath any inheritance in the kingdom of God Covetous man now there there we're going again into the the next thing that Paul's going to talk about so in 2 Timothy Chapter 2 he says flee also the youthful lust but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart God wants us to have pure motives pure thinking pure conversation our whole life cleaned up uh everything just just pure righteousness Faith charity peace all those things like a nice clear stream just bubbling out of the mountains with no filth in it that's the kind of life and conversation that God wants us to have in the message Fellowship he said it's later than what we think it is the coming of the Lord at hand man's Hearts is to the place civilization falling sinking right now just look at this America what a disgrace Look what Jesus said in the last days like it was when Noah they'd be given in marriage and things look at the divorce courts in America is great greater than all the nations put together look at the immoral and you think about divorce I I think I read that 50% of all married couples are going to get divorced look at the immorality look at the perversion of sex perverted clothes out in the west coast and all around now it's the same as it was in the day of lot where you couldn't even find 10 Clean people in the day of lot now look it's come on over to the same thing that's the day where God's going to have a pure spotless bride to show the devil somebody's going to be able to believe his word and live it thousands times thousands growing every year filth dirty ungodly taking the natural use of the body and being perverted into something people with perverted Minds men go out and carry on the way they do women wearing these little old clothes out there they don't think they're wrong sure not their mind's perverted the devil's got a hold of them they don't know it now maybe this maybe these things that I'm reading here will go out and convince somebody if they're not living right and not doing right if you match up with this what this quote is saying then maybe it's time to get right so that your life matches up with the parts of the word that will identify you as a real Christian believer it's time to not pity Patty around and play but but make sure that we're right with God I I was talking with somebody recently where they I think sometimes people get kind of confused about the stature for a perfect man where they lump everything over into growth and say well I can live wrong but that just means I'm going up the statue of perfect man no I I think it's time we get convicted and get really get let's get straight with God and maybe find out if we're really born again or not instead of saying well I'm I'm born again I'm just climbing up the statue of a perfect man all it's not time for greasy Grace it's time for living right and living holy and and making sure we're we're Towing the line and so Paul says let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said I will I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me now you as we meditate on this you know a lot of the Christian journey is is having the right mindset the right mental attitude toward any of God's word will bring it to pass so when we have the right look what these scriptures are doing they're changing the way we look at our situation and the way that we're looking at how we're living a as we meditate on this now now covetousness and in in Exodus it says Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house that so that your neighbor got a nice house and you look at that and say well I wish I had that and you start thinking wrong thoughts about it Thou shalt not cover thy neighbor's wife maybe you start looking at your your spouse and you think man I don't like my spouse I wish I had somebody else I wish my spouse was like somebody else and then you start going down the wrong the wrong Avenue with it nor his manservant nor his maid servant nor his Ox nor his ass nor anything that is thy neighbors now now so what's the antidote to be to covet is to just be content with what God has given you now there now there's a secret to a happy life if you've got a little box or if you got a mansion to be satisfied with what God God has given you right now now there's a there's a oh you can get into some listen you got out to churches and there's some pastors that wish they have a big giant church if you just be content with what God has given you no matter where you are in life if you got a small church or a big church a small house or a big house a small family or a big family a lot of money in the bank or a little money in the bank but to be happy and content with whatever God has given you amen if you get invited to preach a lot or if you don't get get invited to preach a lot no matter where you are in life if you can say God is using me God I'm right where I'm supposed to be if you're just a little housewife in a kitchen making biscuits in the morning and that's what God has wants you to to do then be satisfied with that and then you can be content knowing that you're where God wants you to be so let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee now if you've got that promise lay in the Bible that means no matter what you've got in life as long as you've got Christ you got everything that you need now that's one thing we kind of lose sight of sometimes if if if God is for me who can be against me if God's got my back that's all I need and and we forget sometimes that God if if God is influencing our life and guiding our life we're on like a a track as long as I got my hand on that guide rail like brother BR talked about as long as I'm holding on to that and don't let go God is going to see me to the finish line so I should be content with that right trusting and relying that he is going to see us to the Finish Line because he's got us we're we're his and he's ours amen so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me now there's when you're really trusting in the Lord when you're trusting that God's going to take care of the situation right so he Paul's saying in Hebrews chapter 13 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content in Luke chapter 12 it said and he said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth in Colossians chapter 3 it says mortify Therefore your members which upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupisent and look how it looks lumps in covetousness with all of those things that seem to be pertaining to immoral Unholy living covetousness which is idolatry in 1 Timothy 6:10 For the Love of Money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have aired from the faith and pierced themselves through with any Sorrows brother brand would say selfishness greed immorality everything else that's in the calendar of God's wrongdoing the church is picking up those habits men drinking smoking telling jokes women cutting their hair wearing makeup doing all kinds of things dressing themselves immorally to face the people all those things are because it's a lack of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ that cleanse us from all unrighteousness and another place he said lot was down there greedy and went down in Sodom and kept leaning his tent that way because perhaps Mrs lot wanted them kind of dresses that they were wearing down in Sodom and she wanted to be like that see God God had given them everything they needed but they looked down in Sodom and weren't satisfied with what they had and started to covet the world Paul would say in Romans chapter 7 what shall we say then is the law sin God forbid they I had not know known sin but by the law now look how he says this for I had not known lust except the law had said Thou shalt not covet so he's equating lusting with coveting and then Ephesians chapter 5 but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh Saints let it not even be mentioned and Colossians chapter 3 mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry I want to throw this in there too cuz brother Brown said I haven't covet money he said I don't take money I was a Baptist preacher for several years 12 years pasture of Tabernacle there at Jeffersonville and never one time took an offering in my life never one time I work for a living in other words it wasn't he wasn't doing it for money let's let's we read what he he telling the story and Israel in the church about this Rancher that walked out of there he said Reverend Bram I said yes sir he said you see them mountains Over Yonder now picture this story he's he's pointing to the mountains way out in the distance I said yes sir how far you think they are away I said I don't know he said they're 80 miles said I own Plum to that and Plum beyond that it's my grazing ground I said my that's wonderful he said now see down in there see that City he said I own the bank in that City City I own all that ground down around there and I own this way oh all he all all that land he could as far as he could see that little thing over there that thing over there all the way down to the mountains and then brother brandom said I stopped in this little station wag and I looked at him very nice man I laid my hand on his shoulder I said brother I want to ask you a question he said all right I said look right up this way look go that way how much do you own of that o he said brother random I'm afraid I don't own anything I said there's where my treasures are laying now I don't have nothing down here but a tent or a cottage why should I care they're building a place a palace for me over there of rubies and diamonds and silver and gold his coffers are full and has riches Untold yes sir that's where the riches lays up yonder where your Treasures is your heart is also now now now that's summing up all those things that Paul just talked about to not covet anything of this world not covet somebody don't covet that big nice car your neighbor's got but covet this covet Treasures in Heaven I I I was I was watching in the news recently some some big Hollywood star died and I was thinking about all the stuff that they had all the great riches and everything and then they go down into the grave and and what what is all what is that what is your life for if you just live for the things of this world but if you live for God and you're stored up treasure in heaven what does it matter if you just got a little cottage what if you what does it matter if you got a little concrete house like these little brothers and sisters in Nicaragua or Honduras that don't have nothing in the world but they've got Treasures in Heaven that's more than anything I I was watching a interview of this um this uh actor where they were saying they were asking them why do do the these big Hollywood stars that have everything and they got all this money why do they get so caught up in drugs and he said I'll give you a fair answer and I thought that was pretty good he said because we're born with something empty on in on the inside and I'm we're trying to feel that and see there's the only thing that'll feel that Emptiness is what we're preaching about today and this morning is the is the Gospel of Jesus Christ the only thing that can feel that emptiness that thirst that's in every every person's heart is the life of God so what does Paul say in verse one he says let Brotherly Love continue but not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some of entertain Angels unawares remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity is being yourselves also in the body marriage is Honorable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he ha said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me and in verse S and 8 we we we we'll just kind of get finish on this remember them which have the rule over you amen now there's a scripture that's a little bit misinterpreted who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation what's the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday to day today and forever now the reason I say it's a little bit misinterpreted let's see let's see what brother brandom really said that because we think sometimes the rule over you means like uh that that there's going to be like a king over you that's going to rule over you come into your home and tell you how to dress and how to do and everything and when you need to come to church and and and control you like that and uh but but that's not exactly the way that brother brandom explained this he said it is the word that rules us not men now see we're up behind the pulpit and we're preaching the word to you and when the word grabs a hold of your life is not a man controlling you and telling you every little detail about how you need to live your life but you become subject to the word and the word begins to control you you become like Paul I I'm I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ and the word says I need to come to church so I'm going to come to church not because a man told me that if I don't come to church I'm going to get a scolding but because the word tells me I need to he said said now a man as a husband is head of the woman he rules her but the church is a woman too and her ruler is the word Jesus is the word if she rejects the word and takes any other headship she is an adulteress let's let's read this quote well we got one minute let's read this in these different translations and we'll end on this as the musicians come forward and the NIV remember your leaders who spoke the word of God to you consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith in the ESV remember your leaders those who spoke to you the word of God consider the outcome of their way so what's it talking about your leaders just got to be living a good life because otherwise you will you will lose confidence in them and you will not be able to fulfill their scripture that's why it's so oh we get into something here the next time maybe and NLT remember your leaders who taught you the word of God think of all the good that has come from their lives and follow the example of their faith and the nasb remember those who led you who spoke the word of God to you and considering the result of their way of life imitate their faith and we'll end on that God bless [Applause] you h
