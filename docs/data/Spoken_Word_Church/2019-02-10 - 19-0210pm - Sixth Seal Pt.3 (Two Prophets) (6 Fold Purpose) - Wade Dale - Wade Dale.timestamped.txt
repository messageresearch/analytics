[4:33] we're living in the Pope has visited the
[4:38] Eman of the United Arab Emirates Muslim
[4:43] and said the document signed by Pope
[4:50] Francis and the grand Amman was prepared
[4:53] with much reflection in prayer the one
[4:56] great danger at this moment he continued
[4:58] his destruction war and hatred and if we
[5:00] don't embrace one another kiss one
[5:02] another even pray our faith will be
[5:04] defeated the Pope explained that the
[5:06] document is born of faith in God who is
[5:08] the father of all the father of peace it
[5:13] condemns all destruction all terrorism
[5:15] from the first terrorism in history that
[5:17] being Cain the holy father I don't even
[5:21] like that word the Holy Father said that
[5:24] from the Catholic point of view the
[5:25] document on human fraternity which is
[5:27] fraternizing human fraternity does not
[5:31] go one millimeter beyond the Second
[5:33] Vatican Council the document was made in
[5:36] the spirit of Vatican 2 among Muslims he
[5:40] said there are various opinions but them
[5:42] to it to them to it is a process
[5:44] speaking of his meeting with the Muslim
[5:46] leaders the Pope says he wants to he
[5:49] took what he took away from the
[5:51] encounter were wisdom and fidelity in
[5:53] the past a path of wisdom and fidelity
[5:55] leads you to build peace he left with an
[6:00] impression of being in the midst of true
[6:02] sages I was very satisfied Wow
[6:08] a Protestant and the one most radical
[6:13] religion in the world besides
[6:16] Catholicism and their meeting together
[6:19] and signed a treaty Wow how close are we

[11:54] the people here Lord thank you for the
[11:56] bringing of our youth and the ones that
[11:58] are that are doing the things that Lord
[12:00] sometimes we we only try it we only as
[12:03] humans we only mention the bad that goes
[12:05] on but Lord I I like to mention the good
[12:07] the good things that are happening Lord
[12:10] the things that you're doing in you said
[12:12] this thing is all going to be secret and
[12:14] it will this is all a secret coming of
[12:16] you but it has to be in a bride of Jesus
[12:18] Christ we pray that you'd bless us now
[12:21] and take care of us in Jesus name we
[12:22] pray amen
[12:24] I told them downstairs
[12:25] this morning Sunday's good class that
[12:27] you know and don't get me wrong the head
[12:30] which is Christ is important the most
[12:33] important but without our body the heads
[12:38] worthless without a body think about it
[12:42] without a body the head can send all
[12:45] kinds of signals if there's no body for
[12:49] it to go into it's going nowhere so God
[12:52] said I have to have a body in this the
[12:53] bride of Jesus Christ so him being the
[12:56] head when he fires that receptor coming
[12:57] down from that brain and it goes to that
[12:59] hand his foot doesn't move his hand
[13:01] moves all right so that's what you and I
[13:03] are we're going to be what an
[13:04] instrumentality of God when he moves
[13:06] when that receptor fires in his brain we
[13:09] move all right I'll be held man open the
[13:12] sixth seal and lo there was a great
[13:14] earthquake and the Sun became black as
[13:15] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[13:16] blood and the stars of heaven Wow
[13:20] the stars of heaven fell unto the earth
[13:22] even as a fig tree casteth her untimely
[13:24] figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind
[13:26] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[13:28] it rolled together and every mountain
[13:30] and Island were moved out of their
[13:31] places and the kings of the earth and
[13:33] the great men and the rich men chief
[13:35] captains in the mighty men and every
[13:36] bondman and every free man hid
[13:38] themselves in the dens and the rocks of
[13:39] the mountains and said to the mountains
[13:41] and rocks fall on us and hide us from
[13:43] the face of him that sitteth on the
[13:44] throne and from the wrath of the lamb
[13:46] for the great day of his wrath has come
[13:47] and who shall be able to stand you may
[13:51] be seated warrant as a blessing reading
[13:53] the word if anything if anybody does
[13:54] need anything brother Dale and I'll be
[13:56] together we'll be back late Tuesday
[13:58] night so just call us if you need us or
[14:01] get in touch too brother Terrence or one
[14:03] of the one of the preachers here one of
[14:07] the ministers okay so we'll be back
[14:09] Tuesday afternoon pretty late alright
[14:12] let's start with the first we look at
[14:14] the sixth seal starting with showing
[14:18] what the seal was brother Brown was
[14:20] talking bout the seal being the two
[14:22] prophets and that's kind of what we're
[14:23] going to talk about just for a little
[14:25] while today are the two prophets and
[14:27] then I think what we'll do is is I was
[14:30] looking back there and I'll read some
[14:31] quotes in a minute that's not on the
[14:32] list but we want to we know that all
[14:35] trumpets sound under the sixth seal and
[14:38] we know the trumpets are not
[14:39] to us there to Israel but we do get the
[14:42] spiritual application of it mmm
[14:44] we have to have a spiritual application
[14:46] there has to be a trumpet sound you
[14:49] heard the gospel trumpet yeah man
[14:51] you heard the gospel trumpet and you
[14:53] came to that sounding of that trumpet
[14:56] because remember that's one of the three
[14:58] things that happens and it's coming
[15:00] shall the boys the Trump and what does
[15:06] the trumpet do it always called Israel
[15:08] till the Day of Atonement we'll get into
[15:09] that maybe next Sunday but let's run
[15:12] through this real quick on the two
[15:14] prophets now we know who they are we
[15:16] know their Moses and Elijah all right
[15:18] it's not the person Moses and Elijah
[15:20] just the spirit of modes in the spirit
[15:22] of Elijah that's what the prophet of God
[15:24] said and will not read that for sake of
[15:26] time but let's read number one because
[15:29] we're still even though we're looking at
[15:31] this sixth seal this sixth seal is the
[15:35] last seal of Redemption I know it's 2
[15:41] o'clock but you can say man don't wait
[15:43] to 2:30
[15:43] you say man now okay there we go thank
[15:46] you man we had all them preachers
[15:48] setting up here yesterday morning I mean
[15:49] this morning y'all didn't get a thing
[15:51] he just hit us right to enrich stop
[15:53] doing see what's the gift for sitting on
[15:55] the front row
[15:55] brother board he got a blessing too he's
[15:57] sitting up there also hey man so now
[16:00] with the earthquake let us compare
[16:01] scriptures and then let's going down to
[16:02] the to the red part compare scriptures
[16:04] of this great event that we will see
[16:06] that this great secret or mystery that
[16:08] was under the sixth seal of the book of
[16:10] redemption so we know the sixth seal we
[16:14] know it finishes Redemption but the
[16:15] sixth seal is the whole book the book of
[16:18] redemption is all tied up in that seal
[16:21] one through six because the seventh seal
[16:23] is silence the seventh seal is no
[16:25] movement no motion it's just silence in
[16:28] heaven for the space of a half an hour
[16:30] but seal 1 through 6 there's something
[16:33] going on all the time all right there's
[16:36] movement God is a God of movement all
[16:38] right that's why they say at the Wailing
[16:40] Wall you know they do the their their a
[16:42] God of movement when they're at that
[16:43] Wailing Wall the Jews now they're moving
[16:45] why they that God is a God of movement
[16:48] all right God don't sit still for
[16:50] nothing all right
[16:51] and the sixth seal
[16:53] now remember these are hidden mysteries
[16:55] in the sixth seal all together is one
[16:56] great big book six Scrolls rolled
[16:59] together and it unwinds the whole book
[17:02] of Redemption that's how the whole earth
[17:04] was redeemed so we've come from the
[17:06] redemption of man - now we're looking at
[17:09] we're looking at the redemption of the
[17:10] earth all right but now you got to
[17:13] remember it's this earth first then the
[17:16] ball that we're living on called Earth
[17:18] it will come it will follow see that's
[17:21] why the whole creation is waiting Romans
[17:23] 8 the whole creation is waiting and
[17:25] groaning what for the manifestation of
[17:27] the sons of God this whole world the
[17:29] earth all the earthquakes and all those
[17:31] things that's waiting on me and you
[17:33] because it's not in this right to be
[17:35] conditioned this earth was created for
[17:37] perfect eternal people this earth was
[17:41] created for that wasn't created for
[17:43] chaos and sin and murder and all that
[17:45] stuff it was not it was created to be
[17:49] inhabited by the children of God hey man
[17:52] so that's what we're getting back to all
[17:56] right the second lesson number two so
[18:00] the her little earth is going to be
[18:01] redeemed but it's got to go through
[18:04] something before it gets this Redemption
[18:06] same way as you and I you and I will not
[18:09] go through any physical tribulation
[18:11] period not the wrath of God you and I
[18:17] stand complete in Christ because he took
[18:20] the wrath of God and then he took the
[18:23] wrath of God upon himself annihilated it
[18:27] and says you're perfect all right so
[18:29] that's us but the sixth seal is the
[18:31] tribulation period you and I are going
[18:33] to go through a period of tribulation
[18:35] you're going through one now if you
[18:39] don't have if tomorrow morning you don't
[18:41] have to go to work number one you're
[18:43] blessed but there's not a soul in here
[18:46] that had got a tax issue coming up April
[18:49] the sixth Inc hello oh yeah everybody
[18:52] starting now that's tribulation to me
[18:57] all y'all did get all that money back I
[18:59] want to thought y'all I have to pay
[19:01] every year though you know so I'm going
[19:04] through a tribulation period up to April
[19:06] the 16th and there
[19:07] I have to pay it continues on hey man
[19:10] everybody that gets a man say man but
[19:13] the soap but now that see let's talk
[19:15] about us but we guys to look at this
[19:18] seal though because see all this happens
[19:19] after we leave we will never touch a
[19:22] tribulation wrath of God poured out upon
[19:25] the sinless people that's tribulation
[19:28] the wrath of God poured out on sinless
[19:30] people or swell sending people not
[19:34] sinless people sorry we got that at
[19:37] first but the sinning people are the
[19:40] sinners is where the wrath is poured out
[19:42] okay because look the bride is gone in
[19:46] other words and look let me tell you
[19:47] something about the body of Christ the
[19:49] body of Christ it's not the foolish
[19:52] version the body of Christ is not the
[19:55] 144,000 it's not the cup of water in my
[19:58] name it's not Abraham Isaac and Joseph
[20:02] it's not even John the Baptist it's the
[20:08] bride the bride is his body on the day
[20:11] of Pentecost that's what I told him
[20:13] downstairs listen when Jesus was here he
[20:15] was the head of all things but there was
[20:18] nothing to be ahead of he didn't save
[20:23] one soul by the new birth while he was
[20:25] here on earth not one person sure he
[20:28] said well you know you you keep doing
[20:30] this and you don't do you go sin no more
[20:32] that one but that wasn't an inward work
[20:34] everything eternal was in that man
[20:38] everything eternal was in that man
[20:41] walking on the face of the earth and it
[20:43] was so it was so caught inside that body
[20:46] till he couldn't get out he had to die
[20:49] to release it so he could come back on
[20:53] me and you so his body sure he was
[20:55] standing there with his body but it was
[20:57] an eternal body inside of that body he
[20:59] was living in amen it wasn't his outside
[21:02] physical body listen that was a
[21:04] sacrifice that was Isaiah 53 he gave his
[21:07] soul a ransom now the souls what bought
[21:09] you but his stripes that he took in the
[21:13] things that he took in his body was for
[21:15] you on
[21:16] the outside guy we don't need stripes on
[21:19] in our soul he took those stripes
[21:22] physical stripes to heal your body and
[21:27] then because he get lit there's a
[21:28] separation there he gave his soul a
[21:31] ransom the very soul of God he ransomed
[21:34] his own soul to get your soul because
[21:37] you were in there in that throne
[21:41] somebody said that this morning oh yeah
[21:45] so the six seals of tribulation period
[21:47] so we have to go through a minor one we
[21:50] go through typical tribulation of
[21:52] problems that we have and we're going to
[21:53] cover that later on because those
[21:55] tribulation in this part of the
[21:58] Tribulation Period God sends two
[22:00] prophets down to draw out 144,000 people
[22:04] that are servants to the bride is that
[22:06] Alright say Amen but what's going to
[22:08] happen before that is is that you and I
[22:11] are going to have to come to a
[22:12] Tribulation Period
[22:13] we had a prophet come in the end time we
[22:16] had a prophet pronounce things and I
[22:21] want to clear something up
[22:22] thank you brother Michael for reminding
[22:24] me of that last Sunday I told I was
[22:28] talking about he who prophesy must die
[22:31] all right and that's exactly the truth
[22:33] well brother Michael walks in the study
[22:36] after church and he said well now these
[22:39] people like Samuel prophesied and he
[22:43] wasn't dead yet so I had to go I got to
[22:46] go back to explain that because those
[22:48] who prophesy must die they're
[22:50] prophesying of something to come now
[22:52] look brother Branham prophesied seven
[22:53] dreams or seven visions five of them
[22:56] come to pass while he was still alive -
[22:58] you can say whenever but we know the
[23:00] last one happen because the United
[23:02] States is not laying and ruined yet
[23:03] whatever you want think about the
[23:05] Catholic Church or a woman in the White
[23:06] House I don't really care about that but
[23:08] those happen but the major prophecy
[23:12] brother Branham came to prophesy was
[23:13] that a bride was here that God was in
[23:16] flashing you and me in the Son of man
[23:19] ministry that was his major prophecy
[23:23] think of elijah elijah had many
[23:26] prophecies in his time right elijah the
[23:28] man he lied
[23:29] but remember he prophesied of Jezebel's
[23:33] death but he died or he went he went up
[23:37] in a rapture before that happened right
[23:40] Elijah is the one that saw Jezebel die
[23:43] Amen and what your brother brought him
[23:45] say I've been reading it Elijah top
[23:49] crust he likes your type who the bride
[23:53] so whatever brother branham prophesied
[23:56] to come to pass you and I are the
[23:59] recipients of that part of the prophecy
[24:03] but we must not say then like what
[24:07] brother Dale was talking about we must
[24:09] say well it's coming it's something
[24:11] coming it's something we're going to
[24:14] something what you put that's
[24:16] prophesying then you have to die even
[24:21] Jesus prophesied and he died but he died
[24:24] for me in you he died so that we would
[24:27] become the prophecy hey man we got to
[24:29] step in a priest a long time ago in
[24:32] Jamaica you know brother Branham had
[24:34] that vision of the people in Jamaica
[24:36] going up and down the hills that's great
[24:40] to be to have that prophecy it's great
[24:42] to have brother Branham prophesy over
[24:44] anything cuz I believe what he said was
[24:46] the truth but there had to be a
[24:49] fulfillment there had to be somebody
[24:50] literally standing in that vision and
[24:53] it's not a vision anymore it's not a
[24:55] vision anymore it's a reality but we
[24:58] were standing on that mountain we were
[25:00] going up and down that mountain with the
[25:02] Jamaicans that was a fulfillment of that
[25:04] prophecy that was a prophecy anymore it
[25:08] was reality
[25:09] same thing what's going to happen you
[25:12] and I are going to become the recipients
[25:14] of the prophecy become a reality and
[25:16] then we're gonna leave out of here amen
[25:19] so the sixth seal is the Tribulation
[25:21] Period so that's going to take place
[25:23] after the bride is gone there's no
[25:25] living creatures he's talking about with
[25:27] lying ox man and eagle now God's not
[25:32] dealing with a church anymore and we're
[25:34] going to get into that I've been
[25:37] studying a little bit on that with the
[25:38] Feast of the trumpets cuz remember the
[25:39] feast of atonement
[25:41] I'll read it a little while the feast of
[25:42] atonement
[25:43] you and I are living now under the Feast
[25:45] of Pentecost hello
[25:50] you and I are living under the Feast of
[25:52] Pentecost which the day of Pentecost was
[25:53] back in in 80 30 on that when the day of
[25:59] Pentecost and that day has continued
[26:01] through the Gentile dispensation well
[26:03] when we leave God isn't going to take it
[26:06] to Israel not to kill the sacrifice
[26:09] again but Day of Atonement is the
[26:12] morning that something had been killed
[26:15] we'll get into that so it's okay you can
[26:17] think about it but still in other words
[26:19] they're not going to have to take Jesus
[26:20] Christ and put him back on the cross and
[26:23] show him to the hundred forty-four
[26:25] thousand no the day of atonement will be
[26:27] that they will realize that the lamb has
[26:29] already been killed two thousand years
[26:32] ago and they're going to realize now
[26:34] they're not prophecy they're what was
[26:37] prophesied of and they're standing right
[26:38] in the middle of what was going on and
[26:40] then not all right so he's dealing with
[26:44] Israel and listen you saw and sometimes
[26:47] we do sometimes which old that's all to
[26:49] Israel but it's a great thing for us to
[26:51] see that to see what God is doing the
[26:54] Israel because whatever he's doing to
[26:55] Israel he's already done to us already
[26:59] done to us listen this is on that side
[27:02] of the prophecy right now they get
[27:04] theirs but this is on our Gentile side
[27:07] the bride's gone so whatever prophecy we
[27:09] had we're done yeah hope we prophesied
[27:14] of a millennium no we're not prophesied
[27:19] a millennium the millenniums to the Jews
[27:21] their prophets out of a millennium you
[27:24] said well what about a future home you
[27:27] got it right now
[27:28] it's inside of you where it's gonna all
[27:31] gather together
[27:33] Louisa's little two acres Aaron's gonna
[27:36] need a few more acres he's a little bit
[27:37] bigger but the few acres you set up here
[27:41] you get talked about yeah okay so we're
[27:44] all we all got the part of a city so
[27:46] we're not prophesying of a city because
[27:47] I'm sure John saw the city coming down
[27:49] sure that's gonna be a day of
[27:51] culmination when that's gonna happen but
[27:52] you and I are already promised it right
[27:54] now Israel's promised the Millennium
[27:58] they got to get to it but do you know
[27:59] who is keeping us who's keeping it away
[28:05] oh here we go again and that's true
[28:10] because of the prophecy we have not
[28:13] fulfilled our part of the prophecy yet
[28:16] they without us cannot be made perfect
[28:19] that's our prophecy become perfect I
[28:21] meant God's not dealing with the church
[28:23] anymore done gone he's dealing with
[28:26] Israel this is the other side this is
[28:28] when Israel receives the message of the
[28:30] kingdom by the two prophets read him
[28:32] just a little bit I'm extending him
[28:33] remember Israel as a nation God's
[28:36] servant nation servants not bride
[28:39] service okay and then when when when
[28:42] Israel is brought in it'll be a national
[28:44] affair
[28:45] Israel the kingdom agents were David
[28:48] brother Dale tell me this morning we're
[28:49] David the son of David sits on the
[28:52] throne all right that's what that was a
[28:55] prophecy the prophecies in the Old
[28:57] Testament I believe it's in Ezekiel or
[28:59] somewhere somewhere where it says that
[29:02] I'll never in other words David's throne
[29:05] will be continual now we know that
[29:07] hasn't happened naturally because when
[29:10] Solomon died it wasn't David it wasn't
[29:12] Solomon's son it took over earth it was
[29:14] he didn't last long
[29:15] okay and there's nobody sitting on
[29:17] throne now in Israel so this is a
[29:19] promise in the Millennium that the son
[29:22] of David well he was sitting in his
[29:24] kingly throne and he's not going to rule
[29:26] me in you he's ruling the 12 tribes of
[29:32] Israel you and I are not included in
[29:35] that sure we're gonna sit with him with
[29:37] him there but we're gonna be on the
[29:40] honeymoon yeah nothing's gonna bother us
[29:43] number three and when we find out John
[29:47] said I'll be held win open the sixth
[29:49] seal it was a great earthquake then all
[29:50] nature was interrupted see God's been
[29:53] doing great things like healing the sick
[29:55] open the eyes of the blind doing great
[29:56] works but we find out here that nature
[29:58] took a tumble now we've been talking
[30:01] about what's been happening to people
[30:03] now what's gonna happen is what's gonna
[30:04] happen to the natural earth and listen
[30:08] it's not going to happen just to be
[30:11] happening the two prophets are here
[30:14] we're gone so the wrath of God is poured
[30:17] out on the earth okay but Israel but
[30:21] that's what I believe Israel will be in
[30:23] Goshen 144,000 may go through some kind
[30:27] of persecution but they're not going to
[30:28] be killed until that 1260 days is over
[30:30] amen but the whole lot of the other part
[30:33] of the earth is going to just be in
[30:35] chaos all right
[30:40] yet nature look what taking the
[30:42] earthquake son what black moon wouldn't
[30:44] give it's like star shooting fell
[30:45] everything happened right at the time of
[30:47] the opening of this sixth seal that's
[30:49] when it takes place right immediately
[30:51] after the announcement of those martyrs
[30:53] what the fifth seal the martyrs had been
[30:55] finished aren't number four dick seal
[31:01] same place but we know that this sixth
[31:03] seal is the judgment seal so like I said
[31:06] before you and I don't go through a
[31:07] judgment but we do go through it where
[31:09] did you beat we're judging now to me
[31:13] that's what our judge is now that statue
[31:17] a perfect man is what's judging us at
[31:18] the moment you're not judged for your
[31:21] soul being eternal if you're born again
[31:23] no you're judged whether you can live
[31:26] those all out through there in that
[31:28] outside man or the middle man right
[31:30] right that okay all right so that's so
[31:33] that's so watch that dealing with that's
[31:35] dealing with the earth you live in it's
[31:37] dealing with with the things that we do
[31:39] and we don't do all right
[31:42] for we know that the extinct seal is the
[31:44] judgment seal it is the judgment seal
[31:46] see our judgment seal our our judgment
[31:50] seat is where you're sitting today
[31:53] brother bottom judgment starts at the
[31:56] house of God all right we're not
[31:58] supposed to judge people out there but
[32:00] you know what we're supposed to come
[32:01] together and judge things in the in the
[32:02] sanctuary and not have to take it to
[32:05] court right hey man that's what the
[32:06] Bible says we're not supposed to take a
[32:08] man to court a brother to court now
[32:11] somebody outside yeah because they're
[32:12] just lawless people but you you know if
[32:14] men Lewis had a dispute we're supposed
[32:18] to settle it here we're not supposed to
[32:20] let it get so bad - what we got to go to
[32:22] court whether
[32:22] that's wrong that shows bad lack of
[32:26] judgment and maybe a lot of other things
[32:28] cuz that's what the Bible says how you
[32:30] going judge angels to get judge in the
[32:32] church bring something before the church
[32:35] settle it here I've got the saddle in
[32:37] here you will go sell it and then
[32:39] lawyer's office a nun regenerated lawyer
[32:44] I don't have nothing against lawyers but
[32:47] Jesus did say is go hard for them to be
[32:48] go hard for them to get in the kingdom
[32:50] what is that
[32:52] Right Said Jeanne that's what I said one
[32:55] to anyone
[32:57] well you'll be born again and be a
[32:59] lawyer that's okay but not meaning
[33:03] seeing the church go now it's finished
[33:05] goes up then we see the martyrs under
[33:08] the altar here's the breaking fourth of
[33:10] the judgment upon the people we're out
[33:12] of this tribulation judgement so out of
[33:14] the tribulation judgments gonna come
[33:16] 144,000 redeemed Jews I'll prove to you
[33:20] they're Jews not Gentiles now we know
[33:22] for a fact the two witnesses are not
[33:24] going to be Gentiles because they won't
[33:26] listen to them and the Spirit of Moses
[33:28] and Elijah come from the Old Testament
[33:30] in the Jewish time we know they're not
[33:32] Gentiles okay they're Jews all right and
[33:35] they have nothing to do with the bride
[33:37] and not a thing the bride we done seen
[33:41] the brides gone you can't place that
[33:44] anywhere don't come back until the
[33:45] nineteenth chapter of the book of you
[33:47] know that means the book of Revelation
[33:49] because we go up on for one my brother
[33:51] Dale reads that scripture in Revelations
[33:54] 4 verse 1 it says after these things
[33:56] what after these Church ages revelations
[34:00] 1 2 and 3 is the church ages revelation
[34:03] 4:1 starts off it says after these
[34:05] things what after the church ages are
[34:07] over we go up through that open door II
[34:10] said I heard a voice in heaven says what
[34:11] come up hither and they went up through
[34:13] the open door you and I are going to go
[34:15] up through that open door and then God's
[34:17] gonna come straight down and deal with
[34:18] the Jews we know revelations 5 ISM is a
[34:22] heavenly scene with revelations 5 is a
[34:24] scene that covers a lot of a lot of
[34:27] territory because brother Branham said
[34:29] it was the Lamb doing intercessory work
[34:30] in the church ages alright so that was
[34:33] what was going on there and then what
[34:34] revelation 6 this
[34:36] not to us the sales are to the Jews we
[34:37] know that right Jim revelations 19 we
[34:40] come back into revelations 19 into what
[34:44] the millennium real simple and notice
[34:48] for the sixth seal is the judgment seal
[34:50] of the word so we all have to stand at
[34:52] that judgment seal the words judging us
[34:55] right now pretty simple I mean if we're
[34:59] being judged at the moment but we'll
[35:02] never stand in judgment listen if you
[35:05] become the word in other words if you
[35:08] are the word how can you be judged the
[35:14] word is the judgment the word can't ever
[35:16] be judged the word is the judgment so if
[35:20] you're the Word made flesh
[35:22] you're the judgment made flesh because
[35:25] you and I remember you and I are gonna
[35:27] judge even angels amen
[35:31] so let's go to revelation 11 and let's
[35:36] read now this is the two prophets and
[35:38] there was given me a reed like him to
[35:39] rod
[35:39] I understood saying rise and measure the
[35:41] temple of God the altar and them that
[35:43] worship therein but the court which is
[35:45] without the temple leave out measure it
[35:47] not for it is given unto the Gentile in
[35:51] the holy city shall be tread under foot
[35:52] forty two months we know how long that
[35:54] is 1260 days three and a half years and
[35:58] I will give power unto my two witnesses
[35:59] and they shall prophesy a thousand two
[36:02] hundred and threescore days that's 1260
[36:05] days at thirty days to a month which is
[36:09] exactly three and a half years all right
[36:11] so they're gonna prophesy three and a
[36:13] half of our calendar years they're gonna
[36:15] prophesy 1260 days in sackcloth and
[36:19] ashes clothed in sackcloth these are the
[36:21] two olive trees and the two candlesticks
[36:23] standing before the god of the earth and
[36:26] if any man will hurt them fire
[36:27] proceedeth out of their mouth and
[36:29] devoureth their enemy if any man will
[36:31] hurt them he must hurt them he must in
[36:34] this manner be killed these have power
[36:36] to shut up heaven now who did that know
[36:41] who shut up heaven elijah elijah for
[36:44] exactly how long three and a half years
[36:46] so he knows how to do it
[36:48] and have power over waters turn to blood
[36:50] who did that Moses the whole Nile River
[36:53] oh could you imagine turn that whole
[36:57] river into blood and to smite the earth
[36:59] with all plagues as often as they will
[37:02] so if any plague comes it'll come
[37:04] through those two prophets and then they
[37:06] shall have finished their testimony the
[37:08] Beast that ascendeth out of the
[37:10] bottomless pit shall make war against
[37:11] them and shall overcome them and kill
[37:13] them then remember they lay in the
[37:15] streets dead they don't even bury them
[37:16] they just leave them there CNN got all
[37:18] their cameras and all the other ABC and
[37:21] CBS and NBC and MSNBC and boy you got
[37:25] news everywhere around here now
[37:26] well they got all their cameras turned
[37:28] on these two guys that tormented the
[37:30] world but they gonna get a real surprise
[37:32] when them to just stand up without the
[37:36] help there won't be any paramedics
[37:37] around no God Almighty will raise them
[37:41] right up from the dead and they'll take
[37:43] a rapture all right let's read let's go
[37:48] to number five so that's the two
[37:50] witnesses there on the earth and I like
[37:54] to say they're already on the earth now
[37:56] they're not babies they can't be babies
[38:00] if we're this close to getting out of
[38:01] here they can't be little bitty children
[38:03] they got to be somewhere in this world
[38:05] that's what I mean we must anticipate
[38:07] that this thing's coming to an end real
[38:10] close and must anticipate that the two
[38:13] witnesses are already something's
[38:14] working now they can't receive the new
[38:16] birth so they go in the rapture with us
[38:17] they go out to receive it when we leave
[38:21] I'm just telling you because what goes
[38:24] up the bribe goes up if the brides the
[38:27] only one who goes up is one's got the
[38:28] new birth in their soul so they've got
[38:31] to stay here and preach to the two - the
[38:33] 144,000 all right look what can bring
[38:36] these things but the word so they're not
[38:39] listen they're not just two prophets
[38:41] standing over there just calling fire
[38:44] and calling the earthquakes and calling
[38:46] anything know their word prophets they
[38:49] know what's going on that's why I said I
[38:51] believe they're already here now
[38:52] somewhere in the world and they could be
[38:55] listening to the message you never know
[38:57] they could be they got to know something
[38:59] and then they'll get that
[39:02] morning for the 1260 days okay because
[39:05] look they can do nature any way they
[39:08] want to here it is there the one who
[39:09] brings on this sick seal they uncover
[39:12] and open it up in other words I believe
[39:14] God reveals to them what their what
[39:16] their whole situation is all right
[39:19] remember I mean he even brought Moses up
[39:22] and of course Moses made a lot of
[39:24] boo-boos right and made a lot of
[39:26] mistakes but these two prophets man
[39:28] they're straight from that sixth seal
[39:30] they come right out of Revelations
[39:32] where we just read it and they should be
[39:34] able to see themselves just like that
[39:38] see the sixth seal is completely an
[39:41] interruption of nature and we're going
[39:42] to get into that later on because of us
[39:44] it's the power of God to interrupt
[39:47] nature so that power of God is in them
[39:49] do you get it now there's your seal who
[39:52] does it is two prophets the other side
[39:54] of the rapture
[39:55] so we're gone done there's no one else
[39:58] left here bribed wise there's only
[40:02] 144,000 and two thereby alright with the
[40:07] power of God the Word of God they just
[40:10] condemned nature they can send
[40:12] earthquakes turn the moon into blood the
[40:14] Sun can go down or anything at their
[40:16] command amen there you are there you are
[40:19] see see how the seals open down there in
[40:23] the church age how it showed the martyrs
[40:26] nice talking backwards he's going back
[40:28] and now here's these two prophets
[40:31] because remember mm-hmm this thing don't
[40:33] open in the church age you it opens
[40:36] after we're gone I just read you all
[40:38] that and now here's these two prophets
[40:39] standing here with the Word of God to do
[40:41] anything to nature they want to and they
[40:44] shake the earth and it shows exactly who
[40:47] does it it's Moses and Elijah because
[40:50] there's there's their ministry
[40:52] impersonated again both men oh my do you
[40:55] see it now see what the sixth seal is
[40:57] it's those two prophets so the seal they
[41:00] kept all that sealed up because remember
[41:03] it doesn't say anything about Moses and
[41:06] Elijah in the scripture it says my two
[41:09] witnesses don't even call them prophets
[41:11] it says my two witnesses are witnessing
[41:14] 1260 days
[41:16] then brother branham goes under that
[41:17] seal pulls the seal back off and when he
[41:19] pulls that seal off there's two prophets
[41:21] there's exactly Moses and there's
[41:23] exactly Elijah the two ministries
[41:26] reimburse innate it I don't think this
[41:28] he didn't mean to say impersonate so
[41:30] they're not impersonating it is the
[41:32] spirit of Moses and Elijah all right but
[41:35] see what the sixth seal is it's those
[41:37] two prophets
[41:38] don't let it choke you but watch want to
[41:41] open that sealing you know why he's
[41:42] saying that he said don't get choked
[41:45] because of what I'm doing don't get
[41:47] choked because of what I'm doing he just
[41:49] didn't say that but we can say that now
[41:51] on this side of the prophet being here
[41:53] don't get choked up that a prophet
[41:55] cannot open the seal or can't open the
[41:57] seal because those two prophets open the
[41:59] seal right there got it but we had a
[42:02] Gentile prophet to a Gentile Church to
[42:06] open the seals for me and you to see the
[42:08] redemption of this man the redemption of
[42:11] the body they open a women there you are
[42:15] oh we're living in the eagle day now why
[42:18] did why did he use that phrase he wanted
[42:22] you to realize eagle is prophetic we're
[42:25] living in a prophetic age a prophetic
[42:28] time brother head up among the clouds
[42:31] they opened that sixth seal they have
[42:34] power to do it Amen there's your sixth
[42:36] seal coming open so the two prophets on
[42:39] the earth they're speaking the Word of
[42:41] God and they're not just standing on the
[42:43] street corner going rain when fire
[42:46] earthquake they're preaching their trend
[42:48] they're trying to bring 144,000 people
[42:50] out and during the time of that
[42:53] preaching the Word of God is going to be
[42:57] so real till I really this is just my
[42:59] opinion cuz I can't find it in the Bible
[43:01] then 144,000 is not going to be just
[43:04] doing this oh no they're gonna get that
[43:08] revelation and I think they're gonna
[43:10] start with they're not like the two
[43:13] prophets but they ain't going to keep a
[43:14] mouth shut for 1260 days that's a long
[43:16] time alright so there's your sixth seal
[43:22] opening up see when it opens that state
[43:23] seal sure it's the two prophets standing
[43:25] in there but it's the two prophets -
[43:27] 144,000
[43:29] and they're going to receive the message
[43:30] just like you did and you didn't keep
[43:33] quiet about it you didn't keep silent
[43:36] amen so what are they gonna do let's
[43:40] look at this just for a second and then
[43:42] we'll close on this thought right here
[43:47] let's go to Daniel 9 we got to go back
[43:49] to the Daniel 70 weeks is that Alright
[43:52] saying ma'am
[43:53] we're going to anyway now watch because
[44:08] look these two prophets have everything
[44:14] to do with this that we're getting ready
[44:15] to talk about the two prophets right so
[44:20] that is the sixth seal opening up the 70
[44:24] witness this scripture we're gonna read
[44:26] is the opening part of it is the opening
[44:29] of the sixth seal thereby right cuz
[44:31] watch this let's let's compartmentalize
[44:33] it I wanted to try to do it but I didn't
[44:35] know how to I should have left some gaps
[44:38] in here start to look 70 weeks are
[44:41] determined upon thy people and upon thy
[44:43] holy city now we got it those are two
[44:45] keys seventy weeks is not just to a
[44:49] group of people it's the people and the
[44:52] city because God doesn't just love the
[44:55] Jews he loves that city called Jerusalem
[44:58] amen he loves it why cuz that's what
[45:02] we're going back to God don't go back to
[45:05] something we don't like so this is the
[45:10] redemption you've heard me say it before
[45:12] brother Dale stated meantime this is the
[45:15] six seals to the Jews it's a six fold
[45:20] purpose brother Brown preached to 6-volt
[45:22] purpose we're gonna read some things out
[45:23] of here in just a minute alright so
[45:25] seventy weeks are determined upon thy
[45:29] people and upon thy holy city because if
[45:32] you'll remember when we did the seals
[45:34] there's a time when there was an edit
[45:37] went out to go rebuild the cities they
[45:40] got part of it done they quit
[45:42] that's why that's why the Pharisees
[45:46] looked at Jesus and he said we've been
[45:48] they said we've been building this
[45:49] temple for a forty and nine years or
[45:51] whatever it is and it took him 44 46 and
[45:53] took them 49 you know what sometimes
[45:55] when you preach all that you just if you
[45:58] forget it you're really in your in your
[45:59] humanity you forget all that but they
[46:02] said it took so long but you for reading
[46:03] the Bible it really took them 49 years
[46:05] why because they had to go back and it
[46:07] says it you got to build the wall and
[46:09] the streets they built wanted them to
[46:12] build the other but when they come to
[46:14] that last edit the one that brother
[46:15] branham used when the one went out
[46:17] whoever it was near Meijer one of them
[46:19] went and built the whole thing got it
[46:21] done in 52 days I think it was all right
[46:24] so that's what we're looking at upon thy
[46:26] people and upon thy holy city to do six
[46:29] things there buddy got that six things
[46:31] we're gonna do all right number one
[46:34] finish the transgression to make an end
[46:38] of sins not sin sins and to make
[46:42] reconciliation for iniquity
[46:44] that's three bringing everlasting
[46:47] righteousness that's four seal up the
[46:50] vision and prophecy that's five and to
[46:53] anoint the most holy
[46:54] that's six now that gets Israel into the
[46:58] Millennium is that all right say Amen
[47:01] that finishes their Redemption yeah so
[47:08] six seals finishes our redemption to
[47:12] finish the transgression justification
[47:15] make end of your sins sanctification
[47:18] mate reconciliation for iniquity give
[47:21] you the Holy Ghost and after you get the
[47:23] Holy Ghost that brings in everlasting
[47:24] righteousness seals up the vision and
[47:27] prophecy in you and anoint the most holy
[47:29] he's listen when we take a body change
[47:31] this thing right here is gonna be
[47:32] anointed they'll be okay so that's
[47:39] what's gonna happen to Israel to get
[47:41] them into the Millennium because the
[47:43] seventy weeks of Daniel does not finish
[47:45] until we go into the Millennium all
[47:48] right so that's where people are getting
[47:50] it so bad wrong they're not listening to
[47:52] brother Branham there is one week left
[47:54] after the right
[47:56] I'm gonna say it one more time I don't
[47:58] care what anybody says I'm gonna read
[48:00] you the Bible all right so here now how
[48:03] is that going to happen
[48:05] Daniel we're telling you remember
[48:08] Gabriel's talking to Daniel
[48:10] Gabriel's telling Daniel this seventy
[48:14] weeks are determined upon us anyway when
[48:17] that period happens right here the
[48:19] seventy weeks are finished amen
[48:24] the seventy weeks are finished seventy
[48:26] weeks are determined they're going to be
[48:29] finished when they anoint the most holy
[48:32] stop here now Daniel I'm going to tell
[48:35] you how it's going to happen know
[48:38] therefore and understand that from the
[48:40] going forth of the commandment to
[48:42] restore and to build Jerusalem unto the
[48:46] Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks
[48:50] that Alright 49 years 49 years
[48:58] seven times seven one week equals seven
[49:02] years alright shall be seven weeks and
[49:07] threescore and two weeks so there's one
[49:09] period here seven weeks
[49:11] there's threescore what's threescore 63
[49:16] times two sixty sixty-two weeks so you
[49:20] got seven and sixty-two is how many
[49:24] seven plus 62 is 69 not there's no
[49:31] halves in there anywhere there's not
[49:35] half anywhere in there the street shall
[49:39] be built again in the wall even in
[49:41] troublous times remember they had one
[49:43] they had a trial in one hand and a sword
[49:46] another because you know what the people
[49:48] around there did not want them people
[49:50] back hittin that city then they attack
[49:53] them so God said you put a you put a
[49:56] trial in one hand and a sword in the
[49:58] other and you'd be doing this and then
[50:00] when they said the enemy's coming you
[50:01] got something to fight them with listen
[50:04] people still hate Jerusalem they hate it
[50:06] they hate them just as bad now as they
[50:07] did then just as
[50:08] that that hatred is still there but all
[50:11] what a millennium when Israel gets to
[50:14] rest
[50:14] we're already resting in God but Israel
[50:17] will literally get to rest the land and
[50:20] see there's your Jubilee the land rested
[50:23] at the Jubilee wow this is all good know
[50:29] therefore and understand from the going
[50:30] forth of the commandment to restore and
[50:31] build Jerusalem until the Messiah the
[50:33] Prince shall be seven weeks and
[50:34] threescore and two weeks that 69 weeks
[50:38] after threescore and two weeks shall
[50:41] Messiah be cut off but not for himself
[50:43] why was he cut off he's cut off for me
[50:45] and you amen
[50:47] cuz actually who cut him off the Jews
[50:50] cut him off they're the ones that killed
[50:51] him sure yeah we killed him but I mean
[50:53] literally that's when he turned to the
[50:56] Gentile church age this the Gentile
[50:59] church age comes in right here right
[51:04] here
[51:05] because remember Titus comes in AD 70
[51:09] which is still in the first church age
[51:11] okay we've never broke this down like
[51:14] this I want to break it down if we had
[51:15] if this is all we get done all right
[51:18] the prince shall come shall destroy the
[51:20] city now who is that Titus all right but
[51:25] he was cut off but not for himself boom
[51:27] that he was there's a cross right here
[51:29] he was he was killed after 69 weeks he
[51:35] was killed
[51:36] no halves ain't no half there isn't a
[51:41] half there ain't no I get answered now
[51:43] so ain't ain't no half so the Prince is
[51:49] going to destroy the city and the
[51:51] sanctuary in AD what 70 Titus comes in
[51:55] during the Gentile Age right so this
[52:01] right here is the Gentile Church age
[52:03] comes in right here in these 2,000 years
[52:06] in all this down to here all right now
[52:11] we ready we've had 69 weeks in the Bible
[52:15] correct
[52:16] 69 no sixty eight and a half 67 and
[52:19] three quarters and
[52:22] heeey now listen if we go in a rapture
[52:27] before God starts dealing with the Jews
[52:30] who's that he it's not God because this
[52:37] guy right here breaks the Covenant God
[52:39] don't break a covenant so and he the
[52:45] Antichrist the Pope whoever you want
[52:47] call him and he shall confirm the
[52:50] covenant we just read one of them right
[52:53] there for with many for one week which
[52:59] is seven years so how many weeks or how
[53:06] many years are left after the rapture of
[53:09] the church one week there is seven years
[53:12] left after the rapture of the Gentile
[53:15] Church I do not care what anybody says
[53:18] because that's the Bible
[53:20] that's Bible brother Branham said faced
[53:24] final resting place is in my message he
[53:27] never said that
[53:28] he said face final resting places in the
[53:30] Word of God so I'm gonna go with what
[53:33] the word says
[53:34] and he the Antichrist shall confirm the
[53:37] covenant with many for one week and in
[53:41] the midst of the week three and a half
[53:45] years he shall cause the sacrifice and
[53:48] the oblation to cease now what's
[53:50] happening watch he shall confirm the
[53:52] covenant meeting for one week he's gonna
[53:53] make a covenant but he's not making a
[53:55] covenant with them two prophets they
[53:58] will not make a covenant with the Pope
[54:00] I'll promise you that there are two
[54:01] morning in people prophets there are you
[54:04] set up here you don't go sleep right by
[54:06] morning keep you awake and he shot I'm
[54:10] loud I know I'm loud I'm sorry I just
[54:12] get excited when they when you put see
[54:14] this thing you see the puzzle fit and he
[54:17] shall confirm the covenant that he makes
[54:19] what's he gonna make a covenant he's not
[54:21] gonna make a covenant with them two
[54:22] prophets he's not gonna make his coming
[54:24] in 144,000 he's gonna make a covenant
[54:26] with the whole world Israel is included
[54:29] leave us alone
[54:31] the Pope says leave Israel alone let him
[54:35] go back
[54:36] make their sacrifices if they want to it
[54:39] not the whole process that the Jews are
[54:41] wanting they're wanting to get
[54:42] sacrifices back they want the red heifer
[54:44] they want the Holy of Holies they want
[54:46] the menorah well who owns all that stuff
[54:48] the Catholic Church when this guy right
[54:51] here when Titus went into that city he
[54:55] obliterated the temple took the menorah
[55:00] took the ladder took the gold took the
[55:05] candlesticks took the holy of holies and
[55:09] hold it back where to Rome
[55:13] hold it back to the Pope they wasn't a
[55:17] poop at that time but he hauled them all
[55:19] well I guess it was hauled them all the
[55:21] way back so where are they now they're
[55:25] in Rome and he the Antichrist shall make
[55:29] a covenant because he's gonna tell those
[55:31] Jews I got what you need so if you'll do
[55:35] what I say just for a little while now
[55:36] just for seven years just for one week
[55:38] if you'll do what I'm gonna say I'm
[55:41] gonna do then then I'll give you I'll
[55:43] make sure the nations don't even bother
[55:45] you anymore
[55:46] that sounds good sounds real good
[55:48] doesn't it for one week but in the
[55:50] middle of that week you know what's
[55:51] going to happen they're gonna be in
[55:53] there doing the sacrifice and the
[55:54] oblation and they're gonna make this and
[55:56] they're going to make that but that
[55:57] 144,000 right in this three-and-a-half
[56:00] years twelve hundred and sixty days
[56:02] those two witnesses are going to call
[56:04] out 144,000 born-again believers that
[56:08] are not in the temple making sacrifices
[56:10] no the Bible says they'll mourn that's
[56:14] why I'm gonna we'll get to the Day of
[56:15] Atonement later on the day of atonement
[56:17] is not the killing of the animal it's a
[56:20] morning that there was a kill they're
[56:23] gonna mourn we read it just the other
[56:25] Sunday in Ezekiel or Zechariah where it
[56:28] says they'll they'll say where do you
[56:30] get the scars in your hands they say in
[56:34] the house of my friends that's gonna
[56:35] happen right here in that first part of
[56:38] that week let me give you a key scroll
[56:44] back down or what mmm wait a minute
[56:47] scope I got
[56:49] thank you keep going keep going keep
[56:50] going there you go these six things
[56:53] happen right to redeem Israel and the
[57:00] city and the city got it and the city
[57:04] people and the city because to anoint
[57:09] the most holy we know what brother Brahm
[57:11] said that's the anointing which is me
[57:13] and you
[57:15] coming into the temple that they're
[57:17] gonna build according to Ezekiel 40 and
[57:21] 44 now when I ask you a question if
[57:23] we've only got three and a half years of
[57:25] to finish Daniels 70 weeks if we only
[57:28] got three and a half years left somebody
[57:30] put that right there and put them last
[57:32] three in there how can you bring in
[57:36] everlasting righteousness when you don't
[57:38] even have an armed Battle of Armageddon
[57:39] happen yet think think none of that can
[57:48] happen until the end of that week not
[57:52] the end of third 1260 days at the end of
[57:55] 1260 days that's why I got that and read
[57:57] at the end of 1260 days that is the end
[58:01] of what the two witnesses have come to
[58:04] do they've come to redeem 144,000 how
[58:08] are you going to bring in everlasting
[58:09] righteousness when you're facing the
[58:11] Battle of Armageddon can't happen that's
[58:16] why there's one full week left there's
[58:18] three and a half years that the two
[58:19] prophets prophesy and it's three and a
[58:21] half years for all this other to happen
[58:23] for them to build the Millennium Temple
[58:24] and for us to come back into that temple
[58:26] to put us in the Millennium that alright
[58:32] cuz we're gonna let's read right here
[58:34] there's a few things right here
[58:37] everybody all right say man I'm not
[58:40] trying to be difficult I'm just trying
[58:41] for us to be right touch brother Branham
[58:44] said if you don't get down you're 70
[58:45] weeks right you can't get the seals
[58:46] right that's why we how many times have
[58:48] we been placing this in Daniel 7 2 weeks
[58:50] and Peake and preaching on the seals
[58:51] forever all right thank you for years
[58:55] you're right so we're looking at really
[58:58] alright come on let's be sensible
[59:00] there's three periods there's
[59:02] Roka now go back go back down down to
[59:06] here
[59:09] there's a seven-week a 62 and 7 is 69
[59:14] so there's 70 weeks determined 69 have
[59:19] already happened Bible says that because
[59:24] Titus comes in and takes all this away
[59:27] and on 80 70 and he shall confirm the
[59:31] covenant with many for one week right in
[59:34] here is a Gentile bride being took out
[59:37] when God comes back to the Jews there's
[59:39] one week left for the redemption of
[59:43] Israel now look there's not one week
[59:44] left of tribulation I did not say that
[59:46] never have I said it brother Branham
[59:48] never said it there is not I just told
[59:51] you the Battle of Armageddon gonna
[59:53] happen in the midst of that week because
[59:57] when that when that Pope comes in you
[1:00:00] know what he's gonna do he's gonna walk
[1:00:02] in after that three and a half years he
[1:00:03] said you don't need to do those
[1:00:06] sacrifices anymore I'm the Messiah oh
[1:00:09] you talking about all hell break loose
[1:00:11] when a pope a Gentile Pope walks into
[1:00:16] that temple and stands in the holy
[1:00:19] temple and says I'm God no they gonna
[1:00:22] start pushing buttons you've heard of
[1:00:26] the Samson effect of the Samson you know
[1:00:28] you know if you go down you go if I go
[1:00:30] down you're going with me in the midst
[1:00:33] of the weeks you'll cause the sacrifice
[1:00:34] and oblation the seats will see during
[1:00:36] that time the 1260 days of the prophets
[1:00:38] are gonna be fed to prophets is gonna be
[1:00:39] finished they're gonna have already
[1:00:42] called 144,000 out they gonna be killed
[1:00:44] 144 thousands gonna be killed they go
[1:00:46] I'll take a rapture and then the Battle
[1:00:48] of Armageddon is gonna happen in the
[1:00:51] midst of the week
[1:00:53] so there is only three and a half years
[1:00:56] of Jesus's ministry left absolutely no
[1:00:59] doubt no doubt there's only three and a
[1:01:02] half years of tribulation no doubt but
[1:01:04] there's seven years left to finish
[1:01:06] Daniels 70 weeks to get them in the
[1:01:08] Millennium we proved it and proved it
[1:01:13] and proved it and I just go back to the
[1:01:14] Bible that's what the Bible says you
[1:01:16] argue with the Bible if you tell me what
[1:01:18] brother berm says I'm gonna say did he
[1:01:20] say what that said he did we just didn't
[1:01:23] understand what he's talking about
[1:01:25] because even in the sealed book I read
[1:01:27] it last night brother Brown says 70
[1:01:29] weeks equals seven years he condensed
[1:01:33] all of the 70 weeks of Daniel to three
[1:01:36] and a half years of Jesus's ministry
[1:01:37] over here three and a half years of
[1:01:39] Jesus's ministry over here that's one
[1:01:41] week so when they asked him when is when
[1:01:44] is the threat of the two prophets coming
[1:01:45] he said the last half and he's exactly
[1:01:51] right
[1:01:52] there's three and a half years left here
[1:01:53] there's three and a half years left here
[1:01:55] of the Messiah message all that other
[1:01:57] stuff is to do is the world because
[1:01:59] there's three and a half more years left
[1:02:01] to finish just one week but it's not to
[1:02:03] Israel is to get the world knocked out
[1:02:06] did get everything destroyed and get the
[1:02:07] Battle of Armageddon
[1:02:08] get to 144,000 bite let them build the
[1:02:11] Millennium Temple it's gonna take some
[1:02:13] time because you know what we're still
[1:02:14] in time I'm telling you the Battle of
[1:02:19] Armageddon we think of the Battle of
[1:02:20] Armageddon obliterating everything it
[1:02:22] will not the Battle of Armageddon is
[1:02:25] man's fire it is the battle between man
[1:02:28] and man it is an atomic war it may take
[1:02:32] three and a half years to kill everybody
[1:02:33] it's not gonna be an instant kill
[1:02:38] starvation think of the radiation all
[1:02:44] over the whole world
[1:02:45] but everybody's got to die so there's
[1:02:48] gonna be a point in time where it may
[1:02:50] take a little time we say well the
[1:02:51] Battle of Armageddon is gonna be one day
[1:02:52] no it's not gonna be one day it's gonna
[1:02:54] take time so there's got to be more time
[1:02:57] and you can't bring in everlasting
[1:02:58] righteousness during them but Tommy
[1:03:03] storm there by okay with that all right
[1:03:07] I don't want to be I don't want to be
[1:03:09] mean but I'm telling you you got to see
[1:03:11] what brother Brad was talking about if
[1:03:14] you don't look you don't plate you can't
[1:03:15] place it if you don't see it that way
[1:03:17] cannot place it if you don't see it
[1:03:19] brother Brown said there's three and a
[1:03:20] half years here three and a half years
[1:03:22] here
[1:03:23] so when did the zoo profits they come at
[1:03:25] the end of this one at the last of this
[1:03:28] three and a half years of the ministry
[1:03:29] of Jesus Christ not at the last three
[1:03:32] and a half years of the seventy weeks or
[1:03:33] he's wrong because the Bible's right
[1:03:36] there's one week left after the raptured
[1:03:39] stare at that for about thirty minutes
[1:03:46] listen it's not that I'm right and
[1:03:48] someone else is wrong with the Bible's
[1:03:50] right and we must go back to the Bible
[1:03:52] for everything we get right the man and
[1:03:56] clap if you want to give God the glory
[1:03:59] not me I think God we had a prophet cuz
[1:04:04] we've never known this without brother
[1:04:06] Branham telling us but he can't tell us
[1:04:09] something wrong or we contend just like
[1:04:13] the people out there in the world are
[1:04:14] contending that he was wrong what's the
[1:04:17] first thing they bring up believe the
[1:04:19] sign and all the people the first
[1:04:21] doctrine they brought up was Daniel 70
[1:04:23] we've called they said brother Branham
[1:04:25] was wrong he changed it here and he
[1:04:27] didn't hear and they said three and a
[1:04:28] half it they just don't have the Holy
[1:04:30] Ghost that's the whole problem amen all
[1:04:33] right let's read number six so they're
[1:04:38] going to do six things to put the Jews
[1:04:42] in the Millennium the two prophets are
[1:04:44] going to have their job is for 1260 days
[1:04:48] is to birth 144,000 Israelis or how you
[1:04:55] want Jews so let's just read what he
[1:04:57] said just for just for reading purposes
[1:05:00] to finish the transgression that's
[1:05:02] number one to finish what to finish
[1:05:05] Israel's transgression what is a
[1:05:07] transgress is to go against something to
[1:05:09] transgress against me is to do a wrong
[1:05:11] to me transgressed against you is to do
[1:05:14] her own to you so Israel did it wrong to
[1:05:17] God and in this 70th week what's the
[1:05:23] 70th week seven years in this 70th week
[1:05:26] what's going to happen God is going to
[1:05:29] finish the transgression of Israel what
[1:05:31] through two prophets the opening of the
[1:05:33] sixth seal shows this right here God is
[1:05:36] going to finish
[1:05:37] transgress individual finish the
[1:05:38] transgression will be turning away the
[1:05:40] ungodliness from Jacob and then all
[1:05:43] Israel will be born again now live not
[1:05:46] all Israel 144,000 all right now he
[1:05:49] knows that and you know that but you
[1:05:51] know what God had him say things just to
[1:05:56] try hello even brother Bram said he'll
[1:06:01] have a brother say something against you
[1:06:03] just see how you'll react boy every
[1:06:05] rough let me read you something here's

[1:06:30] maybe I threw it away
[1:06:31] no I didn't I left it at home it's
[1:06:32] hanging up at home it says sometimes it
[1:06:35] says it says something like this he says
[1:06:37] sometimes the reason people hate you is
[1:06:40] because they don't like your they don't
[1:06:42] they their spirit does it in other words
[1:06:45] coincide with yours didn't you put that
[1:06:47] you wrote that didn't you dig there I
[1:06:51] like that I keep that man I'm down but
[1:06:55] look all of them will receive the Holy
[1:06:57] Spirit number two now this is the second
[1:07:00] one bringing this is finish the
[1:07:01] transgression make an end of sin number
[1:07:04] two write this down your paper we stay a
[1:07:05] long time anyway let's go down to number
[1:07:06] two make an end of sins now let's read
[1:07:09] again Daniel finish transgression making
[1:07:11] inter sins
[1:07:11] that's his second purpose of coming
[1:07:13] first is to finish Israel's
[1:07:15] transgression and to make an end of sin
[1:07:17] where did Israel sin where did they do
[1:07:19] their final sin remember when he was cut
[1:07:21] off after that 69 week when Messiah was
[1:07:25] cut off this is what cut him off where
[1:07:27] did Israel sin where did they do their
[1:07:29] vile sin word where did they separate
[1:07:31] themselves from God now listen close
[1:07:33] let's turn to Matthew 24 here's where
[1:07:35] Israel made her fatal mistake I keep
[1:07:37] going on down yeah going down to the
[1:07:40] because he was talking about Pilate
[1:07:43] listen here's their mistake here's their
[1:07:44] sin then answered the people his blood
[1:07:47] be on us and on our children
[1:07:50] so see the two prophets in Revelations
[1:07:53] that we were just talking about they're
[1:07:55] gonna preach god they're gonna preach
[1:07:57] Jesus Christ to them people to take away
[1:07:59] their sin because remember what did he
[1:08:02] say forgive them father for they don't
[1:08:04] know what they're doing that's where
[1:08:06] they've done it he was making an end of
[1:08:08] sin for them how could he do anything
[1:08:09] else but forgive them knowing that he
[1:08:12] had to blind their eyes so that you and
[1:08:15] I could come in amen and there's that
[1:08:18] fifth seal Jew see there's that fifth
[1:08:20] seal you put in there because the only
[1:08:24] way the fifth seal you could come in is
[1:08:26] that God literally blinded his own
[1:08:28] children's eyes amen god bless you all
[1:08:32] right let's read number seven it's
[1:08:35] because you got to do the last one to
[1:08:36] make reconciliation number three is met
[1:08:38] reconciliation for iniquity to make
[1:08:41] reconciliation for iniquity iniquity is
[1:08:43] doing wrong as they did it to cross down
[1:08:46] at the very bottom he made
[1:08:47] reconciliations but it will be not be
[1:08:49] applied to them it was not apply what in
[1:08:52] other words it weren't applied to him at
[1:08:53] the cross they never accepted it but
[1:08:57] they're going to accept it with the
[1:08:58] hunter the two prophets they're gonna
[1:08:59] accept that he made reconcile listen he
[1:09:03] did everything at the cross we did
[1:09:04] everything for us at the cross we've
[1:09:06] just gotta accept that it was not
[1:09:09] applied to them why because they were
[1:09:11] blinded and could not see and why did
[1:09:14] they blind you say well maybe today
[1:09:16] because I'm blind you're willfully blind
[1:09:18] they were blinded because God blinded
[1:09:21] them but you're blind because you're
[1:09:23] willfully blind
[1:09:24] there's no reconciliation for you if you
[1:09:28] believe not I am he jesus said you'll
[1:09:30] die in your sins
[1:09:32] that's right now in Isaiah when he makes
[1:09:37] reconciliation for iniquity still in the
[1:09:39] city for purpose go to number 8 we gotta
[1:09:43] get out of here we got to leave your
[1:09:44] house at 3:30
[1:09:45] who's heard such a thing earth was made
[1:09:50] bring forth in one day for as soon as
[1:09:52] I'm through Bayless she brought forth
[1:09:53] her children that's Isaiah 66 as soon as
[1:09:58] I saw that she was there that that was
[1:10:01] their Messiah she was born again in one
[1:10:03] day
[1:10:04] make reconciliation for sin now see if
[1:10:07] he does all that look end of sin
[1:10:11] reconciliation for iniquity all those
[1:10:14] things what has he done he's restored
[1:10:16] Israel back through the 144,000 give
[1:10:20] them the Holy Ghost and they're standing
[1:10:22] there complete and they got to go in the
[1:10:24] rapture but you got to remember that
[1:10:32] finishes their earthly parked now when
[1:10:36] you bring in everlasting righteousness
[1:10:37] seal up the vision and prophecy in the
[1:10:39] north the most holy that continues on
[1:10:42] after the 1260 days that's why folks
[1:10:44] there's the exactly three and a half
[1:10:46] more years left after the rapture of
[1:10:48] learning 44,000 to finish Daniels
[1:10:51] physical 70 weeks that's just the way it
[1:10:54] is god bless you stand back we'll get to
[1:10:56] the we'll get to the trumpets next week
[1:10:58] I really enjoy those trumpets they may
[1:11:01] not be to us but boy lays nuggets in
[1:11:03] there like you wouldn't believe but you
[1:11:08] and I are privileged that God has give
[1:11:15] us a revelation and you know what it
[1:11:19] fits you don't have to say but he said I
[1:11:24] hate when somebody says that you know
[1:11:27] brother I'm said this and this but he
[1:11:29] also said well now what are you saying
[1:11:30] he contradicted itself no there's only
[1:11:34] three and a half years of Jesus's
[1:11:36] ministry left to finish the to finish
[1:11:42] the redemption part of us in Israel
[1:11:44] because it's real easy you take the
[1:11:46] three and a half years of Jesus's
[1:11:48] ministry now who got that the Gentiles
[1:11:52] remember the Israel was cut off look at
[1:11:54] me just for a second three and a half
[1:11:56] years of Jesus's ministry right here all
[1:12:00] right he was cut off from amongst his
[1:12:03] people so the Jews don't get that the
[1:12:08] Gentiles get this part so the 1260 days
[1:12:13] this promise to Israel is over here
[1:12:17] right Gentiles in between so remember if
[1:12:20] you didn't have the Gentiles you pull it
[1:12:21] together but look it truthfully there's
[1:12:24] not seven years of Jesus's ministry he
[1:12:27] preached three and a half years but the
[1:12:28] Gentiles got this revelation the two
[1:12:31] prophets won't preach the same
[1:12:33] revelation to take out 144,000 so
[1:12:37] brother Branham seventy weeks equals
[1:12:39] seven years he breaks it all down takes
[1:12:41] all the walls and all the bringing and
[1:12:43] this and this and he breaks it down to
[1:12:45] redemption redemption of the Gentiles
[1:12:49] redemption of the Jews so brother
[1:12:52] Branham one of they gonna prophesy the
[1:12:55] last half of this week absolutely the
[1:12:58] last half of the week he's talking about
[1:12:59] it is not the last half of the 70th week

[1:13:30] and ones that wrote the Bible that we're
[1:13:32] now the manifestation of that we're the
