[36:04] back on the next series as we go okay
[36:07] amen good to see brother uh Daniel and
[36:09] his wife and glad to have them with us
[36:11] and if you'd like turn in your
[36:12] scriptures turn where we've been reading
[36:14] from Psalms
[36:18] 118 and then we will go to Zachariah 4 I
[36:22] know you've prayed for him but remember
[36:24] brother Tom he's having swelling in his
[36:26] uh lags and things and luckily it was
[36:29] not as much around his heart so we're
[36:32] glad of that according to brother
[36:34] colleag giv the test the point there and
[36:37] we we pray that the Lord would would be
[36:39] with him he called last night to let me
[36:41] know he's in the hospital and we'll call
[36:43] him out while I see how he's doing but
[36:46] now uh I've been reading this one
[36:48] scripture now this is the 12th service
[36:51] on Psalms
[36:52] 118 but I hope it is beginning to pick
[36:56] up
[36:57] why we're reading this one scripture and
[37:00] what we're using it for because all that
[37:03] we've been needing in the series is in
[37:07] this so it winds up in the 26th verse
[37:09] they talking about you know blessed is
[37:12] he that cometh in the name of the Lord
[37:14] so we've been through the the series of
[37:16] the coming of the Lord and how that uh
[37:19] you know it's a blessed thing to be able
[37:22] to see the second coming of Jesus Christ
[37:25] amen all right and I believe we are in
[37:28] that second coming and the prophet
[37:30] called it the bride coming of Christ
[37:32] coming out of the church he said the
[37:34] second coming we'll give these back over
[37:36] again at a while he said it would be the
[37:38] Rapture that's 308 of the seal book so
[37:41] then what are we looking for he said he
[37:44] he he doesn't come to Earth in the
[37:46] second coming in a physical body he
[37:49] doesn't come to Earth to the Jews in the
[37:52] tribulation in the physical body right
[37:55] we meet to physical body of the Lord
[37:57] Jesus Christ in the air in the Rapture
[38:00] all right so will they meet him in the
[38:02] air in their Rapture because they must
[38:04] be carried up to 144,000 and all because
[38:08] they will be in the millennial Reign and
[38:10] then that's when he comes to Earth in a
[38:12] Corporal body so I don't uh I I hope
[38:16] that's beginning to dwn upon you at
[38:19] least what I believe okay I always tell
[38:21] you what I believe about it then I can't
[38:24] reveal it but I can just tell you what I
[38:26] believe
[38:27] and then I can keep talking maybe long
[38:29] enough for the Lord to be able to reveal
[38:31] it okay Psalms 118 verse 19 and then we
[38:36] will go to Zechariah 4 father we thank
[38:39] you for this day and the hour that we
[38:41] have the time that we have upon this
[38:44] Earth that we be able to recognize the
[38:47] day that we're living and Lord it's
[38:49] never been an age before where man could
[38:51] truly see the hour they were living as
[38:54] being written right out in the the to
[38:56] the word because we see the earthquakes
[38:59] in diverse places we see the pestilence
[39:01] we see the things that the Bible speaks
[39:04] of the the oil throughout the ocean to
[39:06] kill the animals the things that are
[39:09] happening and we realize that we're in
[39:11] the end time and thank you for revealing
[39:14] yourself unto us and Lord we ask you now
[39:16] that you would just bless be with Wai in
[39:18] them as they're traveling back today
[39:20] after the service there and Lord just
[39:23] have your way and then be here with us
[39:25] as we read your word you come and speak
[39:28] to our hearts forgive our sins and guide
[39:31] us in jesus' name we ask it amen
[39:36] amen we'll go to verse
[39:38] 19 Psalms
[39:42] 1118 open to me the gates of
[39:45] righteousness now the gates of
[39:47] righteousness would could only be one
[39:49] thing what the revealed word right I
[39:53] mean what else would you expect to find
[39:54] in the gates of righteousness
[39:57] amen see all right open to me the gates
[40:00] of righteousness I will go into them and
[40:03] will praise the Lord this gate of the
[40:06] Lord into which the righteous shall
[40:08] enter I will praise thee for thou Hast
[40:11] heard me and art become my
[40:14] salvation the stone now there's where
[40:16] we're coming finally getting to it today
[40:18] speak a little oner the stone which the
[40:20] builders refused is become the headp
[40:22] stone of the corner this is the Lord's
[40:25] doing it is marvelous in our eyes this
[40:28] is the day which the Lord hath made we
[40:30] will rejoice and be glad in it save now
[40:33] I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord I beseech
[40:37] thee send now
[40:39] Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in
[40:42] the name of the Lord we have blessed you
[40:44] out of the house of the Lord now let's
[40:48] go over to Zachariah a very familiar
[40:51] scripture with all of us Zechariah
[40:55] 4
[40:57] we will read the first 10
[40:59] verses and the angel that talked with me
[41:02] came again and waked me as a man that is
[41:05] wakened out of his sleep and sath unto
[41:09] me what seest
[41:10] thou and I said I have looked and behold
[41:14] a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl
[41:17] upon the top of it and his seven lamps
[41:20] there own and seven pipes to the seven
[41:22] lamps which are upon the top
[41:25] thereof and two olive trees by it one
[41:28] upon the right side of the bowl and the
[41:30] other upon the left side
[41:33] thereof so I answered and spake to the
[41:36] angel that talked with me
[41:38] saying what are these my Lord now he
[41:41] knows he's there he knows he's seeing a
[41:44] vision he knows that this is not just
[41:47] showing him a lamp stand you know
[41:54] right he knows as a some simp symbols
[41:56] here that must be understood it's not
[41:59] just seeing a lampstand and a and a
[42:01] olive trees you know all
[42:05] right so he was saying what are these my
[42:07] Lord then the angel that talked with me
[42:10] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[42:13] not what these be and I said no my
[42:17] Lord then he answered and spake unto me
[42:20] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[42:23] zerubabel saying not by might not by nor
[42:28] by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord
[42:31] of hosts who art thou oh great Mount
[42:34] before zerubabel Thou shalt become a
[42:36] plain and he shall bring forth The
[42:38] Headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[42:41] Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of
[42:45] the Lord came into me saying the hands
[42:47] of zerubabel have laid the foundation of
[42:49] this house his hands shall also finish
[42:53] it and thou shalt know that the Lord of
[42:56] hosts has sent me unto you for who ha
[43:00] despised the day of small things for
[43:03] they shall rejoice and see the plummet
[43:05] in the hand of zerubabel with these
[43:07] seven they are the eyes of the Lord
[43:10] which run to and fro through the whole
[43:13] earth you may be seated the Lord add his
[43:15] Blessing to the reading of the
[43:18] word we'll need about four up here to
[43:20] pass these quotes out I always like to
[43:24] give you what the prophet said because
[43:27] at least that way you can look at it
[43:30] and understand you know that it's
[43:33] something he said not just me saying it
[43:36] see a lot of people go around and
[43:37] they'll say brother R said so and
[43:40] so
[43:42] well well maybe he did and maybe he
[43:45] didn't because if you can't prove where
[43:48] he said
[43:49] it then you ought not be saying that way
[43:51] to start with but the thing of it is you
[43:55] know if you can show what he said at
[43:56] least you know that to be true
[44:00] now I don't want to back up too awfully
[44:03] much but a little bit to make sure you
[44:06] understand we spoke this last uh
[44:11] Wednesday on the message of calling
[44:15] Jesus on the scene in our
[44:17] lives you might not have thought that
[44:20] would been connected to the coming of
[44:23] the Lord but remember of what that you
[44:27] I've taught you what I
[44:30] believe I believe the second coming of
[44:32] Jesus Christ is the what the prophet
[44:35] said is I said a moment ago the bride
[44:38] coming of Christ coming out of the
[44:40] church all and it is the uh part of
[44:45] being the thing that was never to be
[44:49] understood that dire because even Jesus
[44:53] at the time he was on Earth he he the
[44:56] prophet said didn't know his part in the
[44:59] Kingdom all right now I didn't give you
[45:01] that quote but I'll be sure to fly these
[45:03] if you want
[45:04] them but he said when he come to patmas
[45:06] said then he
[45:08] understood so then that's why it starts
[45:10] off saying the Revelation that God give
[45:11] to Jesus to give to John uh and all
[45:14] because it was something that he didn't
[45:16] understand he didn't know when he was
[45:19] coming so we know then the second coming
[45:22] of Jesus Christ would be a
[45:24] mystery all right now you've got many
[45:28] Mysteries uh in the
[45:30] Bible you know the mystery of the
[45:33] engrafting of the Gentiles and Mysteries
[45:35] of all kind of things the godhead to be
[45:37] understood all of the Mysteries you've
[45:39] go to uh um Church what time is it and
[45:45] you'll find brother randam explaining
[45:47] the Mysteries all right but now my point
[45:51] was to get you to see that if the coming
[45:54] of the Lord is
[45:57] is started on the day of Pentecost in
[46:00] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know
[46:02] the new birth we see then it would be a
[46:05] process that would be taking
[46:08] place and not something to just say like
[46:11] we thought it would be the sky split the
[46:14] trumpet sounds of this the that the
[46:16] other would happen and oh we'd know the
[46:18] Lord's come you know and everybody in
[46:20] the world going to know he's com well
[46:21] then he said it was a
[46:22] secret and then you know well then uh
[46:27] just letay them on that front seat there
[46:28] brother K if anybody needs them they'll
[46:29] have them thank you
[46:31] sir but see I that's why I tell you what
[46:34] I believe that way you don't have to go
[46:37] around and say well what does brother
[46:38] Dale believe at least you know what I
[46:40] believe amen cuz I tell you what I
[46:42] believe all right then you come tell me
[46:44] what's right or wrong see okay but now
[46:49] see calling Jesus on the scene as our
[46:51] lives would be the resurrecting or
[46:54] bringing God back back from history and
[46:57] coming up through what would be talking
[46:59] about the stature of a perfect man right
[47:01] I didn't have time to finish the message
[47:04] I just could hit it just a little bit
[47:06] and the where that we could see him
[47:08] actually coming on the scene in our own
[47:09] lives and by that we would recognize our
[47:12] day
[47:14] right see and people would say but
[47:16] brother Dale the coming of the Lord is
[47:18] is something out there well
[47:21] where right where would it
[47:24] be
[47:26] when your Prophet said that it was the
[47:29] Rapture page 308 of the sick
[47:32] book and he said Jesus don't set foot on
[47:35] Earth until the Millennium in other
[47:37] words we meet him in the a so now what
[47:40] are you looking in the coming see in the
[47:42] first coming of Jesus Christ I brought
[47:45] it out there Wednesday see the prophets
[47:47] brought the
[47:48] body and John being the the one to
[47:51] introduce the head and see the head
[47:55] which was Christ chist came forth upon
[47:57] the Earth You Know The Headstone that
[48:00] was there they rejected him as The
[48:03] Headstone and he became the Cornerstone
[48:06] of the New Testament Kingdom not The
[48:10] Headstone because the prophet said The
[48:12] Headstone hadn't come yet we see because
[48:15] it had to leave him in the Garden of
[48:16] Gethsemane because nobody couldn't
[48:18] understand what it was about you know
[48:20] and see if they had received it that
[48:22] would have been his second coming right
[48:24] there he said that's just too simple
[48:27] well I thought we read somewhere um here
[48:31] in maybe in verse 10 who has despised
[48:33] the day of small things and your Prophet
[48:37] said the day of
[48:41] Simplicity all right see then if we
[48:43] can't make it simple enough until the
[48:45] children can understand it then we've
[48:47] totally missed the whole point anyway
[48:50] you know of trying to preach but now
[48:52] listen recognizing your day and its m
[48:57] message and then accepting that that
[49:01] message not only is for
[49:04] us in this
[49:07] day but it's in US amen we are to make
[49:12] this message manifest right it's just
[49:16] not a book given or tapes given or or
[49:19] sermons given see it it's a life because
[49:23] then that way you can see that while
[49:25] you're Prophet would say like this and
[49:28] this is kind of a secondary title of
[49:30] your message brother Brandon said the
[49:33] seven seal is his
[49:37] coming that's on Feast of the
[49:40] trumpets it's his
[49:43] coming
[49:45] well we're looking
[49:47] for well then he must be
[49:50] coming or has it we missed it to see
[49:54] that he's been coming all the way down
[49:55] down
[49:57] right this is our part of his coming
[50:00] right see all right now watch in a
[50:03] minute when we get to
[50:04] that we go ahead
[50:08] now Jesus
[50:10] Christ would you agree that Jesus Christ
[50:15] and I'm talking about the man now and
[50:17] the whole kitten Kaboodle of all he is
[50:19] right that he was a predestinated seed
[50:23] right would you agree
[50:27] that even before the foundation of the
[50:28] world he stood as a lamb slain
[50:32] right in other words scriptures was
[50:35] specifically speaking of him even my
[50:37] brother Samantha this preacher he said
[50:40] uh a lot of the things in the Bible is
[50:42] Hocus Pocus I said well what do you
[50:43] think about Jesus he said oh yeah that's
[50:45] right said that's that part is right you
[50:47] know because they at least teach them
[50:50] enough in the
[50:52] cemeteries because he had 12 years in it
[50:55] and uh they at least teach him enough
[50:57] about the word to be able to follow
[51:00] things you know and so he'd agree that
[51:02] Jesus was a predestinated seed all right
[51:06] now but brother Bram I gave them to you
[51:08] I just you scan down reading them it's
[51:11] on that's rising of the sun number one
[51:13] on your notes that every age has got a
[51:16] predestinated
[51:20] seed now all right page 10 it's riseing
[51:24] the sun number one okay let me make sure
[51:27] that I'm on the right pages with
[51:38] you yep page 10 is riseing the sun okay
[51:45] now a predestinated seed forever
[51:49] age now do you believe that God knew
[51:53] before the world that there was going to
[51:54] be a false falling away down to the ages
[51:57] right cuz he spoke of it and he said
[52:01] there would have to be a falling
[52:03] away but then you spoke of a
[52:06] restoration well wouldn't you truly
[52:08] believe then that Martin Luther in the
[52:10] days of
[52:12] justification that that was a
[52:13] predestinated
[52:15] seed right now I gave it to you you know
[52:18] cuz I like to lay it in I right number
[52:20] two on your notes 154 the church age
[52:22] book that it's not the person that comes
[52:24] PR destinated eternally from God it is
[52:28] the word our seed right see the person
[52:32] comes predestinated basically by forn
[52:34] knowledge form but wouldn't you agree
[52:37] though
[52:39] that if something is
[52:43] predetermined cuz that's what
[52:44] predestination means now don't you
[52:47] believe that there was a a predetermined
[52:49] word other just shall live by faith now
[52:52] come on see then you'll separate if you
[52:55] keep it in the right order that there
[52:58] then God by for knowledge knew Martin
[53:00] Luther would receive that their brains
[53:03] in your whole scale of
[53:05] predestination but the seed itself was
[53:07] predestinated eternally just like the
[53:10] Lord Jesus was predestinated eternally
[53:13] am so wouldn't you believe that an end
[53:16] time
[53:18] people end time bride
[53:21] people that is to bring this thing to a
[53:23] total end amen amen
[53:26] would you not believe that we are
[53:28] predestinated to be a predestinated seed
[53:31] of the
[53:32] age now I don't go along with what
[53:34] everybody preaches on that no no no I
[53:36] don't because see they bypass Calvary
[53:39] they bypass everything oh I just de seed
[53:41] I just predestinated you know no I I I
[53:44] believe we got to live a predestination
[53:47] right all right see Martin Luther had to
[53:51] preach that just should live by
[53:53] faith he didn't didn't just walk out one
[53:56] day and preach he preached all his life
[53:58] he had to do that and we believe that
[54:01] because that's what you're talking about
[54:03] on a predestinated sea see Jesus you can
[54:07] look at him but what about you and I
[54:09] what about Malachi
[54:11] 4 would you not agree that Malachi 4 is
[54:14] an end time
[54:15] scripture right you know not for any
[54:18] other age down through there but for
[54:20] this
[54:21] age so then it's a predestinated seed
[54:26] we are to re the full word of God right
[54:29] now so you're what now it's not the
[54:32] person who comes predestinated eternally
[54:36] but the word are seed but now when God
[54:39] finishes his plan of predestination
[54:41] that's what I believe we
[54:43] miss that you mean to tell me he doesn't
[54:46] know where that seed's going to
[54:49] fall now he said he did
[54:51] but are you saying well now you know
[54:55] brother Dale you're getting too far into
[54:57] predestination well maybe we're not
[55:00] getting far
[55:02] enough to understand
[55:06] predestination we know that we sure
[55:09] would have to come into the world as
[55:12] lost the prophet would say that seed
[55:15] laying down in there but what was it
[55:17] waiting
[55:21] on what was it waiting on it was waiting
[55:24] on
[55:26] someone for it to land
[55:28] in right so then we bring it
[55:31] predestination into the right point I
[55:33] don't want to get on that I want to get
[55:34] on into the message see Jesus was all
[55:36] the word you agree right now your
[55:40] Prophet said the bride in the end time
[55:42] will be the fullness of the godhead
[55:43] bodily now that's up to you to decide
[55:45] what you want to think about
[55:47] it well I don't know others don't
[55:49] believe that well then you don't believe
[55:50] him so go ahead and forget
[55:53] it but that's only
[55:55] uh mighty God unveiled I know for
[55:57] certain in unveiling of God that the
[56:00] bride is to be the fullness of the
[56:01] godhead bodily why because that's the
[56:03] point we've been talking
[56:05] about what is the point we've been
[56:07] talking
[56:08] about on the second coming of Jesus
[56:11] Christ that God would be visible Among
[56:13] Us and raise the dead and we go into
[56:16] Rapture but visible doesn't mean
[56:19] Corporal that's right physical
[56:22] amen visible means that you can see it
[56:26] with a spiritual eye right because
[56:28] everybody will never see all of the
[56:30] coming of the Lord right that's right
[56:32] cuz how can it be a mystery how can it
[56:34] be a secret if that would be true H but
[56:38] now watch see he was all the
[56:42] work would you agree that the very
[56:45] presence of almighty
[56:47] God walked upon this
[56:49] Earth even a trinitarian order to
[56:51] believe this let alone being believing
[56:53] in one true and living God
[56:56] a trinitarian would have to admit that
[56:59] the Bible says Jesus was the fullness of
[57:00] the godhead bodily right so that
[57:03] shouldn't be no problem to me and you
[57:04] that claim to believe in one God
[57:07] right but do you believe that that was
[57:09] the very presence of almighty
[57:12] God but how many saw
[57:16] it see how he can be actually visible
[57:20] among you and you'll never see him how
[57:23] many actually saw that that was almighty
[57:26] God the very essence or presence of
[57:29] almighty God dwelling on earth right
[57:32] that was his first coming
[57:34] amen right his first coming was an
[57:38] actual
[57:40] presence all right now in his second
[57:43] coming which would be the bride coming
[57:45] of Christ coming out of the church it
[57:49] would not be a physical body because if
[57:51] he's heing a physical body it'd be
[57:53] messing up scripture goz where is body
[57:55] that's right and the prophet of God said
[57:57] these people say they got oil and all
[57:59] this and and blood and all like that he
[58:01] said they're messing it up cuz they're
[58:03] saying that the Corporal bodies here and
[58:05] he said that doesn't work because we
[58:06] meet him in the a
[58:08] right we'll see somebody come along with
[58:10] a great delivery that can just bring
[58:13] them down and just slay it down and say
[58:15] you I can't help it if my brain said hey
[58:18] wait a minute that wasn't what the
[58:19] prophet said right the somebody you know
[58:23] I remember one time we was in a min
[58:25] meeting with some brothers years ago and
[58:27] I said something about the the 144,000
[58:30] getting killed and the two prophets
[58:31] getting killed and I mean that brother
[58:34] said that ain't right I mean right up
[58:36] they just jumping you know that ain't
[58:38] right what do you mean that ain't
[58:41] right well brothers so and so said
[58:46] it oh
[58:48] my I love brother so and so right the
[58:51] Bible but if you'll give me about 2
[58:53] seconds we'll read the scripture where
[58:54] they're killed right and then you give
[58:57] me a couple of more seconds for somebody
[58:58] to bring me my seal book up here and
[59:00] we'll show you in the seal book where
[59:02] the 144,000 the two witnesses killed so
[59:05] I don't give a h what so and so said
[59:08] right well of course you know I wouldn't
[59:10] too popular probably wouldn't be well so
[59:11] and so that don't
[59:13] matter I'm just trying my best to to
[59:16] preach the gospel and be what I
[59:19] am but now remember the title of the
[59:23] message which talking the coming of the
[59:26] Lord but here's your title
[59:31] headstone his
[59:35] presence headstone his presence now
[59:38] watch that in a minute secondary
[59:42] title he is
[59:44] coming the seventh seal glad to have our
[59:47] sister back there with us we always say
[59:49] when you come one time to the church
[59:51] you're welcomed as a visitor but you
[59:53] come two times you're part of love us
[59:54] cuz we don't have anything to join so
[59:56] welcome to
[59:59] you the prophet of God said in the token
[1:00:02] message
[1:00:06] 1963 that it was the bride coming of
[1:00:11] Christ top of the Bride coming out of
[1:00:13] the church like Israel of old number
[1:00:16] three on your notes if she doesn't if
[1:00:20] the sister doesn't have a set of them
[1:00:22] somebody come up and get her a set
[1:00:24] because we believe in what the prophet
[1:00:26] of God said so we read it okay then
[1:00:29] we've read this one over and over it's
[1:00:31] the rising of the sun number four on
[1:00:34] your notes where the prophet of God says
[1:00:36] in the bride coming of Christ coming out
[1:00:38] of the church that there'll be a sheath
[1:00:40] having to be waved number five is off of
[1:00:44] the Rapture is talking about the very
[1:00:46] word Christ means called Church means
[1:00:48] called out he said a church out of a
[1:00:52] church members from every denomination
[1:00:54] ation making up a bride bride tree it's
[1:00:57] it's in the T tape the bride
[1:01:00] tree a bride coming out called okay
[1:01:08] now then
[1:01:10] the the Lord has been coming all the way
[1:01:13] down to there
[1:01:16] am right cuz uni age people were coming
[1:01:20] out of the
[1:01:21] church now the word Church in the Bible
[1:01:24] is called called out all right so now
[1:01:27] but when you're referring to
[1:01:30] bride you're referring to a church of a
[1:01:34] group called out of a church because
[1:01:36] it's just in the Bible it just uses the
[1:01:37] word church to apply for all religious
[1:01:41] forms right right but then when it's
[1:01:43] speaking of the
[1:01:46] bright the chosen ones they are the
[1:01:50] alive word for the age that they were
[1:01:53] living yes
[1:01:55] right which that is sister Kathy we were
[1:01:59] talking about a while ago that is the
[1:02:01] message of the hour of each hour that
[1:02:04] was down through there that message was
[1:02:06] the alive
[1:02:09] word The Living Word Martin Luther was a
[1:02:13] Living Word not a dead
[1:02:16] letter he had the letter but Paul said
[1:02:19] the letter kill
[1:02:20] it but the spirit giveth life all right
[1:02:25] as I said then the prophet in
[1:02:27] Masterpiece covers the part of the body
[1:02:30] being built by the prophets and then the
[1:02:33] life being The Headstone coming to that
[1:02:36] that's number six on you
[1:02:38] notes so in the end time would not end
[1:02:41] up being that John introduced Jesus back
[1:02:44] there the Messiah well then it it is it
[1:02:47] not to be in the end time that the
[1:02:50] headstone is to be introduced and was
[1:02:53] not that what we were reading in
[1:02:58] Zachariah
[1:03:03] now number seven the prophet said Christ
[1:03:05] revealed his own word building the
[1:03:07] church coming out into the
[1:03:11] headstone I'm going to make this
[1:03:12] statement I think three
[1:03:15] times that I have it underline to
[1:03:18] do I
[1:03:20] believe that the coming of The Headstone
[1:03:23] to the bride of Christ
[1:03:26] is the
[1:03:28] closest you'll ever come here in this
[1:03:31] earth the Gentile
[1:03:35] days through the literal coming of Jesus
[1:03:39] Christ
[1:03:42] right because we meet him in the
[1:03:46] air all right but he's going to be
[1:03:48] visible Among
[1:03:51] Us now that headstone was rejected back
[1:03:55] there left Jesus in the garden the
[1:03:58] anointing the prophets said left him but
[1:04:01] his promised to come back in the end
[1:04:04] time on phone who you and
[1:04:08] me well that was just in brother
[1:04:11] brandham no amen for that it was in
[1:04:14] brother brandham but he was not all the
[1:04:17] fullness of the godhead
[1:04:19] bodly but the bride can
[1:04:22] be right
[1:04:25] all
[1:04:26] right but see for him to be visible
[1:04:28] Among Us right on your notes what the
[1:04:31] Holy Ghost is given for take us in the
[1:04:35] Rapture goes on down to the next one
[1:04:38] forgotten Beatitudes where he covers and
[1:04:40] he said he's not been seen for years and
[1:04:42] years and years but now coming visible
[1:04:45] Among Us proof of the Resurrection in
[1:04:49] 1955 he said visible among the early
[1:04:52] risers the alpha and the Omega remember
[1:04:55] we're talking about the other day that
[1:04:57] when Jesus rose from the dead he
[1:05:00] appeared there in the
[1:05:03] scriptures to some of the disciples to
[1:05:08] Mary
[1:05:09] right but then you don't see him anymore
[1:05:12] until the evening
[1:05:14] time but in the evening time it
[1:05:19] appears among the disciples or walks
[1:05:21] through the
[1:05:22] wall now
[1:05:25] you remember back when we were covering
[1:05:27] this message because this is more or
[1:05:28] less a review
[1:05:30] message Lord spoke to me about something
[1:05:33] that I've been praying over 40 years
[1:05:35] about so I don't worry about where I'm
[1:05:38] at because he give me the right
[1:05:41] answer you say pray in 40 years
[1:05:46] yeah yeah see most everybody thinks you
[1:05:49] can read The Prophet's message you got a
[1:05:52] revelation no you got head
[1:05:54] knowledge that's why the scripture says
[1:05:57] that that you can know all Mysteries and
[1:05:59] have not charity you miss it amen
[1:06:03] love because this is the end time that
[1:06:05] you can know all the
[1:06:07] Mysteries or Roberts University has all
[1:06:10] of brother Brandon's Tes and
[1:06:12] books they can sit down and read and
[1:06:14] know all about all of the
[1:06:17] Mysteries but they can't get the
[1:06:20] Revelation I'm
[1:06:23] sorry cuz that's where I believe the
[1:06:25] second coming of Jesus Christ is the new
[1:06:29] birth to you amen that starts it it will
[1:06:32] end when we meet him in the air amen you
[1:06:36] know all right now see because only the
[1:06:40] bride he can appear you remember I gave
[1:06:41] you the appearing my brother Brown said
[1:06:43] he was he's now appearing before his
[1:06:45] coming gave you all the quotes down
[1:06:47] through their jokes putting them on the
[1:06:48] computer they can read
[1:06:51] them but here's one thing I wanted you
[1:06:53] to get just like I did Wednesday
[1:06:55] night you remember Wednesday night if
[1:06:57] you look down at number 15 on your notes
[1:06:59] you'll find
[1:07:02] it you know there in the scriptures in
[1:07:04] Mark 4 where we were talking about it
[1:07:08] Wednesday that those disciples feared
[1:07:12] the winds and the waves didn't they
[1:07:16] right they were scared they thought they
[1:07:19] were going to
[1:07:20] die they go wake
[1:07:22] him he steals the winds and the
[1:07:26] waves and the Bible says verse 41 I
[1:07:30] think is when it's in fourth chapter of
[1:07:33] Mark said they were exceedingly
[1:07:36] afraid that's
[1:07:38] right another words they were more
[1:07:40] afraid of the power the man had that was
[1:07:44] inside the
[1:07:46] boat than they were of the waves and the
[1:07:50] things that could have killed
[1:07:52] him the of God I just gave you one there
[1:07:55] where he says people say brother
[1:07:57] brandham you shouldn't be talking about
[1:08:00] the second coming of Jesus Christ you
[1:08:02] scare the
[1:08:04] people he said why should you be afraid
[1:08:07] of his second
[1:08:09] coming see the reason the disciples were
[1:08:12] afraid they didn't have the new
[1:08:14] birth right cuz there was no way to have
[1:08:16] the new birth till Jesus Christ died and
[1:08:19] was given a new birth all right so they
[1:08:21] didn't have it so they're scared to
[1:08:23] death
[1:08:25] he said are we
[1:08:28] afraid of his
[1:08:30] coming brother Tatum used to talk about
[1:08:33] it and they said it was in a lot of
[1:08:34] brother arounds but he said Jack cold
[1:08:35] would stand up there and just call out
[1:08:38] people you're living in adultery you're
[1:08:40] doing this you're doing that right down
[1:08:41] the line calling out one out or another
[1:08:43] and said after while the line was just
[1:08:47] empty cuz everybody's afraid to come up
[1:08:51] there right
[1:08:55] scared that your sins were going to be
[1:08:58] called
[1:08:59] out why would be if we be afraid of the
[1:09:03] second coming of the god that we claim
[1:09:08] to be living in our hearts and to be our
[1:09:11] savior Our Redeemer our all in all
[1:09:15] right why would we be afraid of
[1:09:20] it you mean if you were gone for three
[1:09:25] months and separated from your wife or
[1:09:27] your husband
[1:09:29] and you wouldn't want to be getting home
[1:09:31] to see him of course not everybody
[1:09:34] would
[1:09:37] right brother used to go to church here
[1:09:39] with us he'd stay up here he'd say I
[1:09:41] don't want to go home he said CU me and
[1:09:43] my wife we get to
[1:09:48] fussing but you mean you don't love your
[1:09:50] wife enough that you want want to see
[1:09:52] her every day
[1:09:55] you need to fall in love
[1:09:58] again and why wouldn't you love God
[1:10:01] enough that you want to see him brother
[1:10:04] R said I want to see the one that died
[1:10:06] for
[1:10:07] me don't you I'm looking forward to the
[1:10:11] second coming of Jesus
[1:10:13] Christ see he appears in the form of the
[1:10:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost to anoint to
[1:10:21] heal signs and wonders takes place he
[1:10:23] can appear in the denominations he can
[1:10:25] appear anywhere to
[1:10:28] today you mean if people got healed
[1:10:30] while the Beatles were singing that that
[1:10:32] wasn't
[1:10:35] God something wrong with your
[1:10:38] mentality now the Beatles wasn't
[1:10:40] God but if somebody got healed it was
[1:10:46] God are we afraid of his
[1:10:52] coming
[1:10:54] no wonder your Prophet would come down
[1:10:56] to it and say he's
[1:10:59] here listen he can appear in a
[1:11:01] denominations appear anywhere but his
[1:11:04] coming is revealed in the
[1:11:06] bride
[1:11:07] see now watch is not the coming that
[1:11:11] we've been speaking
[1:11:13] of the coming of Christ into an
[1:11:17] individual not as a
[1:11:19] group he doesn't come as a group to a
[1:11:22] group he comes to
[1:11:25] individuals Amen in the baptism of the
[1:11:28] Holy Ghost
[1:11:30] right the the Pud this is a gentile
[1:11:33] dispensation right okay number two all
[1:11:36] right see what I said a few moments ago
[1:11:39] of how the coming of The Headstone to
[1:11:41] the bride is the closest to the physical
[1:11:44] coming of Christ we see before we meet
[1:11:46] him in the air in the
[1:11:51] Rapture and you see what I believe
[1:11:53] believe it
[1:11:55] is the second coming of Jesus Christ
[1:11:57] wasn't just because you got born
[1:12:00] again that was him coming in you there's
[1:12:02] something for him to do
[1:12:05] right something for us to
[1:12:08] do all right so can come in as a Rapture
[1:12:12] 308 let's just take something now for a
[1:12:16] minute because this is what I want you
[1:12:18] to think about if you're not there turn
[1:12:20] back in the book of
[1:12:22] Zechariah
[1:12:26] let's go back here and let's just look
[1:12:28] at the book book of
[1:12:30] Zechariah we won't get through all of it
[1:12:32] today I know but even this afternoon we
[1:12:35] won't but I want to drive a point
[1:12:38] down for you to
[1:12:41] see as I
[1:12:44] said Zachariah shown some
[1:12:47] things but he doesn't
[1:12:52] understand have we read the Bible the
[1:12:55] prophet's
[1:12:56] message and admittingly and will admit
[1:13:00] that we don't see what's being
[1:13:02] said you
[1:13:05] agree you read it you read it you read
[1:13:07] it you don't understand it right cuz you
[1:13:10] know there's something there that you're
[1:13:12] not getting right
[1:13:14] amen now you're reading the letter now
[1:13:17] does the book change the next day you
[1:13:19] know do they put out a new book the
[1:13:21] second day that you read it no it's just
[1:13:23] same book it's the same
[1:13:26] Bible the same Bible that mankind used
[1:13:30] to prove there was a
[1:13:33] trinity is the same Bible the prophet
[1:13:36] used to prove there's only one
[1:13:41] God
[1:13:43] right so it was there but it was
[1:13:47] hidden see a mystery is something hidden
[1:13:50] in the word even it said the mystery of
[1:13:52] the inra of the Gentiles was never
[1:13:55] understood by the Jews do you think they
[1:13:56] understood that no
[1:13:58] way you think they wanted to talk about
[1:14:01] RAB the Harlot you think they wanted to
[1:14:03] talk about those things like that no
[1:14:05] they didn't care nothing about those
[1:14:07] things it was part of their history that
[1:14:10] they couldn't
[1:14:13] deny but they didn't want to talk about
[1:14:15] it because it was a mar against
[1:14:19] them because that was a dog coming in a
[1:14:22] gentile
[1:14:24] but back there in the Old Testament
[1:14:25] spoke of
[1:14:27] it you think they liked as brother
[1:14:29] randam said do you think a real true Jew
[1:14:31] would like to tell about how that David
[1:14:34] had his best friend's W uh best friend
[1:14:37] killed to get to take his wife you think
[1:14:40] they wanted to write that no but God
[1:14:43] made them write it they had no choice
[1:14:46] that's right they didn't want to admit
[1:14:48] it they would probably have some form of
[1:14:51] a great beautiful story to tell of why
[1:14:56] this don't work but it's still in the
[1:14:59] word today people can explain this and
[1:15:03] explain that but it's still in the
[1:15:06] word you
[1:15:11] know but
[1:15:13] look now this is very something similar
[1:15:16] simple to all of us we already be able
[1:15:17] to
[1:15:20] understand but look at him he now Angel
[1:15:23] talked with him and he awakened him and
[1:15:25] he showed him verse two what seest thou
[1:15:29] in other words he said unto him and I
[1:15:31] said I've looked and behold a
[1:15:34] Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon
[1:15:36] the top of it and seven lamps there on
[1:15:39] and seven pipes to the seven lamps which
[1:15:41] are upon the top
[1:15:44] thereof now he shows him a picture of
[1:15:48] something maybe he showed him a
[1:15:51] lampstand maybe he showed him you you
[1:15:53] know like seven golden candlesticks your
[1:15:55] Prophet explained those things
[1:15:57] right and then he saw verse three and I
[1:16:00] he said and two olive trees by
[1:16:03] it two olive trees would be two trees
[1:16:05] growing up you know that's what he
[1:16:09] saw one on the right side the bowl and
[1:16:12] the other on the left side there Ro so I
[1:16:15] answered and spake to the angel that
[1:16:16] talk with me saying what are these my
[1:16:20] Lord what are you trying to show me
[1:16:26] okay what do you think he was trying to
[1:16:28] show
[1:16:33] him what do you think he was trying to
[1:16:35] show
[1:16:42] him we know the story right but do we
[1:16:46] have the Revelation that's right we know
[1:16:48] the story correct right seven golden
[1:16:52] candlesticks
[1:16:54] it's not a a a like a a candle burning
[1:16:58] you know but it was a lampstand like you
[1:17:02] know my and seven of them and going up
[1:17:05] and and then the two olive trees was not
[1:17:09] two olive trees growing out in the
[1:17:11] bushes you
[1:17:14] know because the oil was running out of
[1:17:17] the olive trees down into the
[1:17:20] bowls and keeping the candles
[1:17:27] burning
[1:17:29] now to show you something that really
[1:17:31] amazed me and it really clicks and I
[1:17:34] asked a man about it the other day and
[1:17:35] he said oh man I got to think on that
[1:17:38] when we were in Israel there's four of
[1:17:41] us here today that will witness that you
[1:17:45] know you talk about seven golden
[1:17:47] candlesticks the manora if I pronounce
[1:17:50] that
[1:17:52] correctly
[1:17:53] and brother George Smith he hollered he
[1:17:55] said hey Sam he said how many
[1:17:57] candlesticks are
[1:18:00] the of the thing you know I said brother
[1:18:02] George there's seven golden candlesticks
[1:18:05] why would you ask that he said would you
[1:18:07] mind looking over at the House and
[1:18:09] Senate of
[1:18:10] Israel the dean sister piggy would hear
[1:18:13] my wife back there and we were riding
[1:18:15] down through there he said would you
[1:18:17] mind looking over at the house and Sen
[1:18:19] it you know big vat building
[1:18:24] I said yeah he said what's that on the
[1:18:25] top of it I said that's the
[1:18:28] manora he said would you count the
[1:18:33] candlesticks I said 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
[1:18:38] 9 I said brother George you got to
[1:18:40] explain something to
[1:18:44] me I even asked Ruben the guy and he was
[1:18:47] wonderful to try to express
[1:18:50] it see most people don't know that the
[1:18:53] manora has
[1:18:55] nines
[1:18:59] candlesticks how but R around said seven
[1:19:03] I'll take seven well okay do what you
[1:19:05] want to you're not going to change what
[1:19:08] I'm
[1:19:10] saying I asked Reuben I said Ruben what
[1:19:12] does that
[1:19:13] mean and the Jews believe in seven-day
[1:19:15] creation we believe in six day creation
[1:19:17] and you know God Rest in the SBB the
[1:19:19] Jews they'll say it this way they say
[1:19:21] seven days creation they don't say s
[1:19:23] days of creation they say seven days
[1:19:25] creation I keep asking him you know and
[1:19:27] he'd say it again 7day
[1:19:29] creation and he said you know he said
[1:19:33] seven of those is seven day
[1:19:35] creation and he said we believe that one
[1:19:38] of those other two represents the god
[1:19:41] that you're
[1:19:44] worshiping I said well
[1:19:46] Ruben would you believe maybe the other
[1:19:49] one would represent the person that done
[1:19:50] the
[1:19:51] worshiping he he said I don't know never
[1:19:53] thought of it that gives me a
[1:19:58] thought but you say but now brother Dale
[1:20:00] I've
[1:20:01] seen they're flag so am I all over the
[1:20:06] place it's got seven golden candle
[1:20:09] sck CU you see God made that Nation
[1:20:12] testify and not put the nine up
[1:20:16] there made them testify in their
[1:20:19] flag of the seven golden
[1:20:21] candlesticks
[1:20:23] because John goes to patmas and sees the
[1:20:25] same thing it we'll get to in a minute
[1:20:27] right and here is
[1:20:29] Zachariah and what's he covered seven
[1:20:32] lamps seven golden candlesticks not
[1:20:35] seven candles burning they burn out but
[1:20:39] seven lamp stands you keep pouring the
[1:20:41] oil in it it keeps burning all
[1:20:44] right
[1:20:47] now still though what did you what are
[1:20:51] these my Lord
[1:20:56] and I wonder if some of you catching on
[1:20:59] some of the words I use I'm not a
[1:21:01] theologian but I got a little
[1:21:03] sense
[1:21:05] and when he says to him watch this is an
[1:21:09] angel speaking to
[1:21:13] Zacharias and Zacharias
[1:21:17] says what are these my
[1:21:19] Lord look down at it if you got an
[1:21:22] scopal
[1:21:23] Bible that's little l r d lowercase Lord
[1:21:28] it means an angel of God was speaking to
[1:21:34] Zechariah now when you get down to verse
[1:21:37] eight in a few minutes says were ver
[1:21:38] moreover the word of the Lord look at
[1:21:42] it an uppercase one of these days it'll
[1:21:45] appear to you why I'm using that might
[1:21:47] take you 40 years that's all right it
[1:21:50] took me 40 years to know something about
[1:21:52] those Le stands I mean about those um
[1:21:56] candles the
[1:21:58] uh two witnesses we'll get to it
[1:22:01] later but look verse
[1:22:05] 5 then the angel that talked with me
[1:22:07] answered and said unto
[1:22:09] me knowest
[1:22:12] thou not what these be and I said no my
[1:22:17] Lord now here's his
[1:22:21] explanation
[1:22:23] well you just got to explaining it there
[1:22:24] seven golden candlesticks representing
[1:22:26] the seven Church AG now your Prophet
[1:22:28] just got to explaining that's what it
[1:22:30] is do you believe
[1:22:32] him now what is it
[1:22:35] doing what is his answer back to
[1:22:41] zable then he answered and spake unto me
[1:22:45] saying this is seven golden candlesticks
[1:22:47] represents Church ages to come down
[1:22:48] through the
[1:22:49] Cent uh that's not what it says
[1:22:53] in words that's what it says by
[1:22:58] Revelation okay
[1:23:01] look then he answered and SP to me
[1:23:05] saying this is the word of the capital l
[1:23:09] r
[1:23:10] d unto
[1:23:16] zable Zechariah I'm going to show you
[1:23:19] what I showed

[1:23:37] sometimes and find out that there was a
[1:23:39] natural Governor back there that his
[1:23:41] name was jerub
[1:23:43] zerubabel but
[1:23:46] look he said this is the word of the
[1:23:50] Lord under
[1:23:51] jerub
[1:23:54] not by
[1:23:55] might nor by power but by my spirit
[1:23:59] sayth the Lord of
[1:24:03] hostes he didn't say seven golden
[1:24:05] candlesticks represen seven Church
[1:24:10] ages right that's what he said cuz what
[1:24:14] were the seven Church
[1:24:17] ages the bride of Christ down through
[1:24:20] seven Church ages right which was the
[1:24:22] word of God for each age right you agree
[1:24:26] so now that's exactly what he's showing
[1:24:28] him right it come on read your scripture
[1:24:31] right there in front of you he answered
[1:24:33] and spake unto me saying this is the
[1:24:36] word of the Lord what I showed you is

[1:24:42] the Lord through seven Church ages
[1:24:44] coming down the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:24:46] the word of God made manifest
[1:24:50] right come on that's why I believe
[1:24:52] that's his second coming is so I'm not
[1:24:54] finished with all this so don't worry
[1:24:56] about it I'll give you what I want to

[1:25:14] 6 he said this is what I'm trying to
[1:25:17] show
[1:25:18] you that it's the word of the
[1:25:21] Lord
[1:25:23] and the word of the Lord is shown by
[1:25:24] seven Church
[1:25:29] ages
[1:25:31] right each age was the word of God alive
[1:25:34] for that age the people of that age amen
[1:25:38] that's why it say coming see verse seven
[1:25:41] now who art
[1:25:44] thou oh great
[1:25:48] Mountain before
[1:25:51] zerus
[1:25:52] in other words who AR thou there's he's
[1:25:54] showing him something look like hey wait
[1:25:56] a minute now there's a mountain look
[1:25:57] like standing here I got a problem I
[1:25:59] can't get over
[1:26:01] it he said before zerubu Thou shalt
[1:26:05] become a
[1:26:07] plain
[1:26:08] right what's he going to do now what's
[1:26:12] his zerubu going to do and he shall
[1:26:15] bring forth The Headstone thereof with
[1:26:18] shouting crying Grace Grace unto
[1:26:21] it
[1:26:24] I've heard a lot of people in this
[1:26:25] message preach that Jesus preached three
[1:26:27] and a half years back there and that
[1:26:29] that was a high first first half of his
[1:26:31] ministry and the last half would be
[1:26:33] judgment preached by the prophet now you
[1:26:35] show me that in the
[1:26:36] Bible I want your Prophet saying
[1:26:41] that it's the message of
[1:26:44] Grace you turn down Grace you're going
[1:26:47] to be judged the two two witnesses will
[1:26:49] take this message to Israel that's right
[1:26:52] amen there's not they don't have to
[1:26:54] preach seven years of a different three
[1:26:56] and 1/2 years of a Grace Ministry three
[1:26:57] and 1/2 years of a judgment you turn
[1:27:00] down because that's what they're going
[1:27:01] to preach to them they're going to
[1:27:02] preach this message over there to them
[1:27:04] to make the seven years that is
[1:27:06] Promised but now keep it in mind of what
[1:27:09] we're saying who art thou oh great
[1:27:11] Mountain before jeru zerubabel Thou
[1:27:14] shalt become a plain in other words he's
[1:27:17] going to what was it in John that uh how
[1:27:19] was it in in John there in the
[1:27:21] scriptures that explaining when John the
[1:27:23] Baptist came that the high places would
[1:27:25] be made low the Low Places would be made
[1:27:27] High read your Bible you know right
[1:27:30] right cuz that's what's happening here
[1:27:33] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[1:27:35] thereof with shouting crying Grace Grace
[1:27:37] unto
[1:27:39] it moreover the word of the Lord came
[1:27:42] unto me
[1:27:44] saying the hands of zable have laid the
[1:27:48] foundation of this
[1:27:51] house now here's where I get in
[1:27:55] trouble but you find it you find zerubba
[1:28:00] will laying the
[1:28:03] foundation he did
[1:28:06] not the original Foundation was swept
[1:28:09] off of the original where Solomon built
[1:28:14] the
[1:28:16] temple so now you say what are you doing
[1:28:18] you correcting the scripture and the
[1:28:19] prophet no just hold on a minute then
[1:28:21] don't turn your computers off out there
[1:28:24] and say this guy's goofing Hub listen I
[1:28:26] want to read what your Prophet said
[1:28:27] about it he said he took us back to the
[1:28:29] foundation in
[1:28:32] t CU brother randam never laid the
[1:28:34] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[1:28:36] they laid it Jesus Christ is the Chief
[1:28:38] Cornerstone that's right was laid by the
[1:28:40] apostles that's right what zerubabel
[1:28:43] then done they cleaned off the original
[1:28:46] Foundation that Solomon had left in the
[1:28:49] temple amen and then to begin to build
[1:28:53] right right the hands of zeru will have
[1:28:56] laid the foundation of this
[1:28:58] house his hand shall fin also finish it
[1:29:02] and he and thou shalt
[1:29:05] know that the Lord of hosts has sent me
[1:29:09] unto
[1:29:10] you who ha despised the day of small
[1:29:13] things for they shall rejoice and shall
[1:29:16] see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel
[1:29:19] with those seven eyes they are the eyes
[1:29:21] of of the Lord which run through to run
[1:29:24] to and fro through the whole earth over
[1:29:26] in the Book of Revelations we don't have
[1:29:28] well we'll try to get in a minute but
[1:29:30] there's seven eyes seven spirits in the
[1:29:33] Book of Revelation right is the Holy
[1:29:35] Ghost in seven Church ages right do you
[1:29:38] need that quote from Brother
[1:29:40] brandham it is the Holy Ghost in seven
[1:29:42] Church ages but now listen Zer Rubble
[1:29:45] the actual meaning of his name it is
[1:29:48] Prince with
[1:29:50] God Prince with
[1:29:53] God now according to my understanding
[1:29:55] about a prince a prince is a Son of
[1:29:59] God but he's waiting to be
[1:30:02] king is that the correct understanding
[1:30:04] he's not
[1:30:05] King he's in
[1:30:08] process to be king all right see this
[1:30:11] perfectly showed in what look at
[1:30:17] number I have to pick up where I'm at 17
[1:30:19] in your notes we done jump the way over
[1:30:28] read all these others in
[1:30:30] between I give them to
[1:30:33] you this is off the message of
[1:30:36] Grace in 17 18 19 17 18 is both off the
[1:30:42] same message
[1:30:44] 17 and 18 all the way down right look
[1:30:48] from the message of Grace preached in
[1:30:49] 1961 827
[1:30:53] and we're all acquainted with the
[1:30:54] scripture that read that reads the Bible
[1:30:56] we know that that was during the time of
[1:30:58] the preparation of the restoration of
[1:31:00] the temple and zal was a great Prince
[1:31:03] among the people who had laid the
[1:31:05] foundation of the
[1:31:06] building he he even says those things
[1:31:09] that's fine cuz that's what he done he
[1:31:11] cleaned it all watch him explain it n a
[1:31:13] minute and I want you to put on your
[1:31:15] spiritual thinking cap anointing jacket
[1:31:18] this morning as we think and this great
[1:31:19] Prince that had to had determined to
[1:31:21] rebuild a house of the Lord and then
[1:31:24] when he did he had laid the foundation
[1:31:26] stone and as we read on further we find
[1:31:29] out that God said zeruel has laid the
[1:31:31] foundation with his hands he also shall
[1:31:33] bring forth The Headstone I want you to
[1:31:35] notice he never said he shall bring
[1:31:37] forth the
[1:31:40] Cornerstone he shall bring forth The
[1:31:43] Headstone now this prophet in the end
[1:31:45] time didn't bring a
[1:31:47] Cornerstone Cornerstone was faith of the
[1:31:49] fathers we're build on the foundation
[1:31:51] Apostles Prophet Jesus Christ being the
[1:31:53] Chief Cornerstone because that's what he
[1:31:54] goes on to explain and we know that the
[1:31:56] scripture says that Jesus is the Chief
[1:31:59] Cornerstone and he's also the headstone
[1:32:02] now if we'll think for a few minutes
[1:32:03] that the seventh Church messenger was to
[1:32:06] restore the faith of the children back
[1:32:08] to the fathers in other words rebuild
[1:32:11] the church again under the power of the
[1:32:14] spirit not by power not by might but by
[1:32:17] my spirit sayth the Lord not by
[1:32:19] organization not by denominations but by
[1:32:21] the holy Spirit God will bring forth the
[1:32:23] church in the last day zerubabel the
[1:32:25] prince was Joshua was the one that was
[1:32:27] to bring forth this headstone he had
[1:32:30] laid the foundation he had took the
[1:32:33] people back to the foundation in
[1:32:37] typ do you see why I was saying that a
[1:32:39] minute ago now rer lay the foundation he
[1:32:42] cleaned it off
[1:32:44] right and he didn't lay the Cornerstone
[1:32:47] Cornerstone goes on that part see
[1:32:49] because the Cornerstone is disciples
[1:32:52] see but where was
[1:32:54] it zerubabel represents the end time
[1:32:58] messenger which is not brother brandham
[1:33:01] he's not the messenger the Lord Jesus
[1:33:02] Christ is the messenger sure there's a
[1:33:05] man to be used upon Earth but my
[1:33:07] goodness get it right see he never laid
[1:33:09] the Cornerstone the disciples laid that
[1:33:11] Cornerstone but in the end time in the
[1:33:15] bride coming of Christ coming out of the
[1:33:17] church the prophet is going to bring
[1:33:19] forth The Headstone crying Grace Grace
[1:33:21] unto
[1:33:25] it now because God promised it see he
[1:33:29] had to take us back to the foundation
[1:33:31] before he could even speak of The
[1:33:34] Headstone you got to go back to the
[1:33:36] faith of the fathers before hear all of
[1:33:39] this before you can speak of the the
[1:33:40] love of God to headstone you you can't
[1:33:42] just do it I know this may be strange to
[1:33:44] some but hang
[1:33:46] on he took us back in
[1:33:48] time cleaned off the foundation
[1:33:52] taking us back to the faith of the
[1:33:54] fathers showing that original
[1:33:58] Cornerstone that's the coming of The
[1:34:01] Headstone and what the coming of The
[1:34:03] Headstone is what the adoption to the
[1:34:06] Bride of Jesus
[1:34:09] Christ which the prophet of God calls to
[1:34:12] the way I look at it is the visible form
[1:34:14] of Jesus
[1:34:16] Christ see then in the end time is a
[1:34:18] special people to bring the headstone of
[1:34:21] Jesus Christ into
[1:34:27] manifestation now to prove we're right
[1:34:30] about the coming of The
[1:34:33] Headstone when they were building the
[1:34:35] Temple or restoring the temple when they
[1:34:37] built the temple and then there was in
[1:34:39] restoration of the temple 2 chonicles 5
[1:34:42] and uh 10 and First Kings 8 and9 there
[1:34:46] was nothing in the Ark of the Covenant
[1:34:49] save the 10 stone or the table bble to
[1:34:51] Stone that the Ten
[1:34:55] Commandments that was what was in the
[1:34:57] Ark of the Covenant was the Ten
[1:34:58] Commandments you had pockets on the side
[1:35:00] Moses wrote other laws which he wrote
[1:35:02] other things which he wrote Genesis
[1:35:04] Exodus Leviticus number Deuteronomy that
[1:35:06] was not laying in the Ark of the
[1:35:09] Covenant that was in the pockets along
[1:35:10] the side there was Pockets made for
[1:35:12] those
[1:35:14] things because the Ten Commandments the
[1:35:16] prophet of God Called It the seals which
[1:35:18] is number 21 of your notes if you look
[1:35:20] down our reading 300 unveiling of God
[1:35:23] 1964 he talks about when the
[1:35:25] Commandments came right the seals
[1:35:28] came read it number 21 on your
[1:35:31] notes but you see what the secret was
[1:35:34] that even when the tables of stone went
[1:35:37] into to read your scripture we don't
[1:35:39] have
[1:35:41] time there when they was doing it and
[1:35:43] got the temple ready brother R said
[1:35:46] there wasn't nothing in there but a
[1:35:48] bunch of
[1:35:50] furniture
[1:35:52] that's his words in one of the quotes I
[1:35:54] gave to you and what does it
[1:35:57] do then came the two tables of stone the
[1:36:00] Ark of the Covenant came into the
[1:36:07] Tabernacle that was The Headstone that
[1:36:09] was the capping Stone your Prophet said
[1:36:11] called it on dedication we'll get back
[1:36:12] to it more this afternoon on the message
[1:36:15] dedication said we already have the
[1:36:17] stones the stones for ordained we got
[1:36:19] all of them way up from Ephesus to
[1:36:21] Ephesians number 19 on your note we're
[1:36:23] only waiting for the headstone that the
[1:36:24] builders rejected waiting for his coming
[1:36:26] the capping Stone the great stones are
[1:36:29] confessions we know that confession is a
[1:36:32] stone and then he goes right on over it
[1:36:34] to explain to you what it
[1:36:38] is explaining to you what those things
[1:36:41] were those two tables of stone that went
[1:36:44] into that's number 19 of your notes when
[1:36:47] the tables of stone was on the inside
[1:36:49] two tables of stone same song The then
[1:36:53] what
[1:36:54] happened read your scripture when the
[1:36:56] two tables of stone came in the Ark of
[1:36:58] the Covenant came into the to the
[1:37:00] Tabernacle then the Shak of Glory
[1:37:05] fell
[1:37:06] right and the prophet of God called the
[1:37:08] T called The Ten Commandments to seals
[1:37:11] he didn't have any trouble with doing
[1:37:12] that why cuz I can take them one after
[1:37:14] the other and preach all the rest of the
[1:37:15] afternoon on the Ten Commandments I've
[1:37:17] done it before so no problem and show
[1:37:21] you how that each one will fit right
[1:37:22] together cuz what is the first one
[1:37:24] behold oh Israel the Lord thy God is
[1:37:26] one huh marriage and divorce you know
[1:37:31] it's all right there in the Ten
[1:37:34] Commandments everything's right in the
[1:37:36] Ten Commandments cuz the Ten
[1:37:38] Commandments was the word of
[1:37:40] God but that was not the that was The
[1:37:43] Headstone to the church but it was not
[1:37:45] the shik of Glory The Headstone had to
[1:37:48] be in place before the shikan glory
[1:37:50] that's what everybody in the message
[1:37:51] look looking at The Headstone and they
[1:37:52] call it the sh kind of Glory come some
[1:37:54] great anointing going to strike when he
[1:37:55] day that headstone
[1:37:58] huh you're out of your
[1:38:04] scriptures read your
[1:38:06] Bible your Prophet told you what it said
[1:38:09] and went right back to the dedication
[1:38:11] look at him number 20 on your
[1:38:13] notse that's when it found its final
[1:38:15] resting place this you kind of Glory
[1:38:17] that followed those capping Stone not
[1:38:20] the corner the in stone the main thing
[1:38:22] all other Stones was of none effect
[1:38:25] until then but this main Stone came in
[1:38:27] The Headstone and took its place
[1:38:30] positionally for its resting place for
[1:38:32] that generation the glory of God filled
[1:38:34] a place where they were sitting and
[1:38:36] there was Shak kind of Glory upon the
[1:38:38] whole building and the glory was so
[1:38:39] great till the the priest couldn't even
[1:38:42] Minister because of the
[1:38:47] glory well brother dad what are you
[1:38:49] looking for I'm looking for just what it
[1:38:51] says over there on number 22 on your
[1:38:53] notes which I give it to you over and
[1:38:57] over questions and answers 19 and uh 54
[1:39:02] brother ROM said after the door of the
[1:39:05] Gentile church is closed all on God
[1:39:07] anoint the church then God will do in
[1:39:09] one year what theologist tried to do in
[1:39:10] 2,000 years watch
[1:39:13] him he said but he's doing it
[1:39:17] now keep reading till you see where
[1:39:19] that's underline he said he's doing it
[1:39:21] now why cuz he's anointing us the new
[1:39:25] birth is the anointing of the baptism of
[1:39:27] the Holy Ghost in the soul of the
[1:39:28] individual he's doing it but one day
[1:39:31] after the door of the Gentile church is
[1:39:35] closed now let me say it one more time
[1:39:38] see that's why I believe that the
[1:39:40] headstone is the visibility of almighty
[1:39:43] God to come among the
[1:39:46] church adoption time when he can pour in
[1:39:50] his fullness
[1:39:53] and he can say here you
[1:39:55] him I told him many many many years ago
[1:39:58] probably about 40 something years ago
[1:40:00] 40 they were talking about boy I'll be
[1:40:03] glad when that headstone comes we can
[1:40:05] just speak the word I said you got to
[1:40:07] have it before it can do you any good CU
[1:40:09] see I knew that quote there then because
[1:40:11] I've had these quotes in my Bible a long
[1:40:16] time that those two tables of stone was
[1:40:19] The Headstone that come into the the
[1:40:21] temple then the Shak Glory follows those
[1:40:24] capping Stones The Prophet said follow
[1:40:27] that headstone The Headstone is the word
[1:40:30] amen what other headstone would you
[1:40:34] want oh I want this great anointing amen
[1:40:37] so do we all that's all
[1:40:42] right we'll get to it this afternoon
[1:40:44] where the Prophet said power apart from
[1:40:47] character is what satanic he said it was
[1:40:50] satanic
[1:40:53] all I want is the power of God it can be
[1:40:56] satanic to you too
[1:40:59] right I want the word in
[1:41:02] place I want the temple built now words
[1:41:04] I'm pointing back here the statue of
[1:41:06] perfect man to them on tell you I want
[1:41:07] this temple
[1:41:08] built in me and in
[1:41:12] you and then we'll realize what the
[1:41:15] headstone really is the revealed word
[1:41:17] amen then there your kind of Glory can
[1:41:20] fall amen like it did back there when
[1:41:23] they built the Tabernacle in the
[1:41:24] wilderness was the same then when they
[1:41:26] built the natural Temple it was there
[1:41:29] and so was it in the days of zerubabel
[1:41:33] when they brought it in there which is
[1:41:34] the book of es Ezra and the different
[1:41:36] ones through going through
[1:41:39] there read those through there and
[1:41:41] you'll find the restoration of the
[1:41:45] temple but that's what I wanted you to
[1:41:47] see we didn't get time to go over in the
[1:41:48] Book of Revelation we'll go this evening
[1:41:51] in the Book of Revelations you find the
[1:41:53] seven golden
[1:41:56] candlesticks right you find just what
[1:41:59] I've been talking about
[1:42:01] that Zachariah was speaking of well
[1:42:04] Zachariah what did you see I saw seven
[1:42:06] golden
[1:42:08] candlesticks Zachariah what is that I
[1:42:10] don't know I just seven golden
[1:42:14] Candlestick when a prophet sees things
[1:42:17] he doesn't understand un until God
[1:42:22] reveals it you
[1:42:25] agree he he may see something look
[1:42:28] crazy you know that who was it uh
[1:42:31] non non looked down through time and he
[1:42:34] saw Buick and O mobiles running up down
[1:42:37] expressways and saw them running into
[1:42:39] each
[1:42:40] other that's right what'd he write down
[1:42:44] he didn't know what a Buick nose mobile
[1:42:46] looked like he didn't know what a car
[1:42:47] looked like he didn't know how to
[1:42:48] describe it the only thing he had to
[1:42:49] describe it with was what what he said
[1:42:51] chariots jostling in the
[1:42:54] streets he knew what that
[1:42:57] was he knew those were vehicles that
[1:43:00] people were being carried in and he knew
[1:43:02] chariots were josing in in the streets
[1:43:04] with vehicles said running like
[1:43:07] lightning other words he can see them
[1:43:09] with torches standing on the side of
[1:43:11] those things or Little Old Lantern
[1:43:13] things something made torches
[1:43:15] mainly on the side of those
[1:43:18] chariots but he really seen Buick and
[1:43:20] mobiles running up and into each other
[1:43:22] on the
[1:43:24] expressway see when the prophet sees
[1:43:26] things he doesn't
[1:43:30] understand he has to wait for God to
[1:43:33] reveal
[1:43:35] it then when he reveals it then he can
[1:43:37] tell us right so your Prophet told us
[1:43:41] what it meant in
[1:43:42] Zachariah the seven golden candlesticks
[1:43:44] and what it was all
[1:43:46] about but did you catch it see the short
[1:43:48] end of scripture said but now what it he
[1:43:51] said this is the word of the
[1:43:55] Lord the word to jerub not by power not
[1:43:59] by my but by my spirit sayith the
[1:44:02] Lord who's going to build a church ages
[1:44:04] who's going to bring the statue of
[1:44:05] perfect man God
[1:44:08] is our part is only to yield ourselves
[1:44:11] unto
[1:44:13] that like I've always tried to tell you
[1:44:16] how do you get those virtues in the
[1:44:18] Statue of perfect
[1:44:19] man
[1:44:21] I waited 71 until 80 but
[1:44:23] 82 10 years or more Waiting for God to
[1:44:26] tell me what that was how could I get it
[1:44:28] all if we need patience we just start
[1:44:30] beating the Daylights out of each other
[1:44:32] tribulation work of patience that's
[1:44:33] don't bring you to the stature of
[1:44:34] perfect
[1:44:35] man I knew better than
[1:44:38] that and I waited and I prayed and one
[1:44:41] day the Lord said only through the
[1:44:43] revealing of the word can those virtues
[1:44:47] come into
[1:44:48] be I said thank you Lord as enough for
[1:44:52] me to preach about 5 years
[1:44:56] on what he showed me the other day about
[1:45:00] those two olive trees is enough to
[1:45:03] preach through the
[1:45:08] Millennium but think on these
[1:45:11] things can you see the church ages in
[1:45:14] the Bible spoke of in Zechariah now this
[1:45:16] evening we'll pick it up in the New
[1:45:18] Testament and we'll read it from the New
[1:45:20] Testament
[1:45:22] and see what it actually is talking
[1:45:23] about we'll see what zerubabel
[1:45:26] saw and what took place and why zerubu
[1:45:29] would sweep off the foundation lay the
[1:45:31] foundation sweep it off all of those
[1:45:34] things can be
[1:45:35] used but what they were really doing was
[1:45:38] rebuilding a
[1:45:40] temple
[1:45:42] right they were rebuilding the temple
[1:45:44] they finally got the temple
[1:45:46] made but that wasn't what that talking
[1:45:49] about that we're talking about God
[1:45:51] revealing himself down through seven
[1:45:53] Church
[1:45:55] ages not by power not by might by my
[1:45:58] spirit sayth the Lord let's stand come
[1:46:00] on
[1:46:02] brother think on these
[1:46:06] things what do you see
[1:46:10] Zariah I just see
[1:46:13] candlesticks do you know what that means
[1:46:16] no I don't know what it
[1:46:18] means that brother brand who was it was
[1:46:21] um let's
[1:46:23] see now if I miss this and forgive me
[1:46:25] but I think it was when um Peter saw the
[1:46:29] vision of the sheep being let down and
[1:46:32] saw the animals and the things or
[1:46:34] something like that brother said and
[1:46:36] said Peter probably thought well maybe
[1:46:37] we're going on a fishing trip or hunting
[1:46:41] trip now he showed him the engrafting of
[1:46:44] the Gentiles
[1:46:47] right when the prophet sees things
[1:46:51] he's got to explain
[1:46:53] it that's why it says that the word
[1:46:56] comes to the
[1:46:59] prophet but then after it comes to the
[1:47:02] prophet there's a five-fold ministry
[1:47:04] that's got to break that
[1:47:05] down of course today as I get to it this
[1:47:09] evening today everybody you know they
[1:47:11] just got a
[1:47:12] onefold and then all the preachers have
[1:47:15] just got a onefold
[1:47:17] themselves you I believe in a fivefold
[1:47:22] Ministry but I believe God will use that
[1:47:25] go ahead brother what what do we got 46
[1:47:28] spiral
[1:47:30] book
[1:47:35] 460 anybody have a
[1:47:38] need
[1:47:49] not
[1:47:52] not by
[1:47:57] my this
[1:47:59] mountain shall be
[1:48:03] removed this you got a
[1:48:07] mountain I only know one that can move
[1:48:12] it by the spirit of almighty God through
[1:48:15] the revealing of his
[1:48:19] word right where we're
[1:48:26] atable represented the end time Prophet
[1:48:29] to bring us the
[1:48:33] message that's SW can bring to
[1:48:38] headstone what do you think that Prophet
[1:48:40] stop when he was sitting out there and
[1:48:43] that Vision was fullfill when he saw
[1:48:45] those seven
[1:48:47] angels be
[1:48:52] they appeared
[1:48:54] there they told him not like to see of
[1:48:57] the word he tell you on the first H he
[1:49:00] didn't know what it
[1:49:03] was they told him to go home it'll be
[1:49:07] told you when you need
[1:49:10] it he went home God made him that first
[1:49:15] day and he revealed the first season he
[1:49:18] said I don't know what the second third
[1:49:19] four
[1:49:22] a he just
[1:49:25] kid prophets don't
[1:49:29] play
[1:49:31] be you got a m in
[1:49:36] your you speak to the one that can move
[1:49:38] the
[1:49:43] out you remember the story about the
[1:49:45] little kids that wanted to Mountain
[1:49:46] moved out cuz the Sunday school teacher
[1:49:48] was telling them if you believe God
[1:49:50] he'll do
[1:49:52] anything you know them little kids were
[1:49:54] smarter the teachers said I just don't
[1:49:56] think we can do it so they just got
[1:49:57] their bucket when I started doing little
[1:49:59] sh you
[1:50:00] know well they probably gave up went
[1:50:03] home forgot about it but you know one
[1:50:04] day the construction crew came through

[1:50:08] to take that mountain out of your way
[1:50:09] and make a road right through
[1:50:11] there you see they believed
[1:50:15] it can we believe
[1:50:18] it no if God gives in a hurry yeah okay
[1:50:22] yeah that's
[1:50:24] fine but faith is really built where you
