[0:33] a brand new
[0:56] free
[0:59] jesus

[1:33] me
[1:50] jesus
[2:11] open the eyes of my heart
[2:46] to see you
[3:02] holy holy
[3:15] pour out your power and
[3:26] oh
[3:45] moses had met him a lot of things but
[3:47] one day he wanted to see it
[3:49] and that's the way we are right i mean
[3:51] good to see everybody in the house of
[3:52] the lord if you'd like to run any
[3:54] scriptures turn back where we've been
[3:55] reading from first corinthians 11
[3:58] and
[4:03] remember the announcements that's been
[4:05] made this coming weekend the
[4:07] uh sweetheart banquet
[4:09] was to be there by six o'clock i'm gonna
[4:11] start taking pictures by then so i try
[4:13] to come a little earlier for could
[4:15] and everything will be doing and then
[4:17] we'll try to do that and then wade will
[4:20] be speaking to us as we're eating from
[4:22] six
[4:22] from about seven somewhere in there and
[4:25] we can get it together okay
[4:27] now i know you don't pray for these but
[4:29] brother uh
[4:31] tommy went to his operation fine today
[4:33] and everything is fine so we just keep
[4:35] remembering him had to drain a lot of
[4:37] fluid out so remember that and sister
[4:39] sarah um
[4:41] aaron's wife she failed the other day
[4:43] and
[4:44] uh cracked her
[4:45] hand now as far as i know it's a
[4:48] like a lime cracker or something within
[4:50] it you know and uh you know it's not
[4:52] what you call a broken bone but it's a
[4:55] line in there which is really probably i
[4:56] guess in some respects worse
[4:58] but uh she was doing fine the other day
[5:01] with it but just keep her in your
[5:02] prayers i know it'd be a lot of pain
[5:04] and remember that and also let's see huh
[5:08] yep brother claude weissinger will be by
[5:11] here with us
[5:12] on the 29th of this month on wednesday
[5:15] preaching for us to go into florida
[5:17] remember that remember the fellowship
[5:18] meeting will be on the third saturday
[5:21] uh march the
[5:22] 17th at 3 30. so remember that i think
[5:26] that's all the announcements haven't
[5:27] missed any
[5:30] so let's just pray and then we'll go
[5:31] right into a scripture
[5:34] our precious lord and our savior our
[5:36] redeemer or all in all
[5:39] and jesus is that wonderful name that we
[5:41] think about
[5:43] we love you and we thank you father and
[5:44] we ask you to just come on the scene in
[5:46] our hearts and lives because we believe
[5:48] here in the end time that truly we are
[5:51] there at that time to be able to
[5:53] understand
[5:55] it would be a time to open the letter i
[5:58] see and we thank you
[6:01] then in that we believe your word said
[6:05] the lord you sent your word and healed
[6:06] us
[6:08] and delivered us from destruction so we
[6:10] depend upon that we believe you
[6:12] we thank you for all things just come on
[6:14] the scene tonight and as we speak about
[6:16] you and
[6:17] seal up our lips lord and don't let us
[6:20] say anything it would be wrong in any
[6:22] way
[6:23] but let us just be honest with each and
[6:25] every one of us that we all lord look to
[6:27] you the author and finisher of our faith
[6:30] we love you and we thank you and we
[6:32] committed to you now in jesus name
[6:34] amen
[6:39] verse
[6:41] first corinthians 11 verse
[6:44] 17 now in this that i declare unto you i
[6:48] praise you not that you come to gather
[6:50] not for the better but for the worse see
[6:52] in other words they have a lot of
[6:53] problems for first of all
[6:55] when you come together in the church i
[6:57] hear that there be divisions among you
[6:59] and i partly believe it for there must
[7:01] be be also heresies among you
[7:04] that they which are approved may be made
[7:06] manifest
[7:07] among you so it's not just that it might
[7:10] could happen
[7:12] it's necessary that it happens
[7:15] to prove those who can stay with the
[7:17] word and it will come out okay first
[7:19] peter 3 15 says but sanctify the lord
[7:23] god in your hearts
[7:25] and be ready always to give an answer to
[7:27] every man that asketh you a reason of
[7:29] the hope that is in you with meekness
[7:32] and
[7:33] fear you may be seated lord that is
[7:35] blessing
[7:36] to the reading of the word
[7:39] now
[7:40] we've been taking now for a few services
[7:44] uh
[7:46] trying to take some things that
[7:49] you know
[7:50] some of the believers in the message or
[7:52] the people believe and
[7:53] we are ashamed to
[7:55] say a lot of times that there are so
[7:57] many doctrines that are among the people
[8:00] of the message but
[8:02] there's also
[8:03] one truth about it
[8:06] the scarecrow is always where the good
[8:08] corn is at
[8:10] you know so if you plant something in
[8:12] your garden
[8:13] and you've got a bunch of
[8:15] old naughty weeds and things you don't
[8:17] put the scarecrow there
[8:19] you put it where the good stuff is at
[8:21] you know so that's the way it is and
[8:23] like i told you in reading that
[8:25] scripture it's
[8:27] it's not just a point of happening it is
[8:29] the fact that god wants to try you and i
[8:32] to see if we'll stay with the word
[8:34] all right so it's a trial and a test and
[8:36] a doing to see if we will just abide in
[8:39] the word and go right home all right
[8:42] now we've covered over a few
[8:45] couple of trickery services now
[8:48] and we covered like two souls two lords
[8:51] um
[8:53] jesus not being god to the river jordan
[8:55] we covered the seven thunder virtue
[8:58] message
[8:59] and then we got on to this last
[9:02] sunday afternoon on the point that they
[9:05] were saying that we don't have the holy
[9:06] ghost like they did in the book of acts
[9:10] and uh you know we've covered those
[9:13] things so if anybody hears that or
[9:15] interested in doing you can go back and
[9:17] hear the tapes
[9:19] and connect on you know to to hear that
[9:23] right but now i've said this or tried to
[9:25] every time i think i've covered it
[9:27] that
[9:28] just because when i will announce a
[9:30] doctrinal thing
[9:32] uh there are many many different groups
[9:34] of people believing many different ways
[9:37] and are all related to that
[9:40] and uh it's kind of like it was when we
[9:42] was in the baptist church not throwing
[9:45] off on them because i'm saying we're
[9:47] over here
[9:48] you know you had a lot of little
[9:49] fling-offs in the baptist church you had
[9:51] people that believe this and people
[9:53] believe that people believe this people
[9:54] believe that all kind of doctors
[9:57] presbyterians you had all kind of do it
[9:59] pentecostals
[10:01] and all but they they had like a one
[10:04] common gold ground or whatever to walk
[10:07] on and that's why uh we talk about those
[10:10] things
[10:11] and i say this to you like i said before
[10:15] that each one of these things that we've
[10:17] covered or will cover
[10:21] this is as far as i understand and have
[10:23] heard
[10:24] of the people
[10:26] you know especially preachers that i
[10:28] have listened to
[10:29] about these doctrines and you know
[10:32] that's why i do it and say
[10:35] that i would agree or disagree with
[10:37] whatever it would be
[10:38] all right and i say also that there's
[10:40] many people who believe just parts
[10:43] of these doctrines and things you know
[10:46] just uh just believing in parts of it or
[10:49] what it's bringing
[10:50] but you know uh it still is there
[10:54] all right now tonight we're going to
[10:56] talk about
[10:58] something that has been uh were around
[11:01] the message for quite a while and
[11:03] and uh
[11:05] prevalent i guess you would call it or
[11:08] among a lot of what we would call the
[11:10] big ministers of the message and they
[11:13] they follow on the line like this and
[11:15] you know and hearing some of them you
[11:18] maybe have never heard like i said some
[11:20] of these doctrines maybe you've never
[11:21] heard
[11:22] because maybe you've not been out well
[11:23] you're lucky you know
[11:25] that you haven't heard these things but
[11:28] you know i try to warn us because
[11:31] you know that we could be believing some
[11:34] of these things
[11:35] and it not be right
[11:38] well i want us to be right no matter
[11:40] what you know or who is offended at what
[11:43] we say or what we believe but just
[11:46] remember to you on the internet and
[11:48] anyone listening to this tape i'm
[11:49] talking to my church here if you want to
[11:52] listen and
[11:53] and consider that's fine
[11:55] but i am not your pastor i only pastor
[11:58] the church here in lula and i'm
[12:01] responsible for the souls here so then i
[12:04] just try to answer to the best that i
[12:05] can
[12:07] as i said as to some of the things that
[12:08] i've heard
[12:10] but now a lot of people believe
[12:13] that
[12:14] brother branham
[12:16] was the one that came to john on patmos
[12:20] to bring him the revelation
[12:23] that's right of these things all right
[12:26] and uh
[12:27] you know
[12:30] i certainly don't want to
[12:32] say anything
[12:34] contrary
[12:36] to
[12:37] some of the things but i also want to be
[12:40] blunt about what i say
[12:41] because at least that way i can be
[12:43] helped if i'm wrong you can correct me
[12:45] uh but see a lot of people that said
[12:47] they believe john now
[12:48] their own pathways we'll get to it a
[12:50] minute in the angel when john fell down
[12:52] to worship and told him to worship him
[12:54] not
[12:55] and and all he said i'm of thy fellow
[12:57] brethren and the prophets and things and
[13:00] they believed that that was actually
[13:02] brother branham that came
[13:04] there and uh
[13:07] the only
[13:10] uh
[13:11] i'll try to give even quotes that shows
[13:13] these things as to what they use and
[13:15] what they believe
[13:17] but
[13:18] the one thing i want you to think about
[13:20] as we start this thought
[13:24] uh
[13:25] you'd say well we'll read where brother
[13:27] brown said it was a prophet
[13:29] all right all right let's read that
[13:32] we'll read a lot of things that said in
[13:34] the bible so let's read it
[13:37] but then we must
[13:38] come down to a conclusion
[13:41] and be able to state
[13:43] and that's why i read that scripture you
[13:45] know to be able to give a reason of the
[13:46] hope with of
[13:48] what lies within you so see i have a
[13:50] right to ask you
[13:52] you know what do you believe
[13:54] as well as you have a right to ask me
[13:57] what i believe because you're supposed
[13:59] to be ready to give an answer of the
[14:01] reason the hope that lies within you
[14:03] and all like that and like i said a lot
[14:06] of you may have never heard this thought
[14:08] but it is prevalent among a lot of the
[14:12] of the ministers of the message that
[14:14] speak about it all right
[14:17] but the one thing i want to to emphasize
[14:22] before we start
[14:26] see i think that we
[14:28] we put
[14:30] the emphasis upon
[14:34] the one who came to john
[14:38] all right
[14:39] you know on papua's now we'll read just
[14:41] a minute but i'm just making my point
[14:44] and uh you know we put the emphasis upon
[14:46] who came to john
[14:48] now
[14:49] uh all that's well and good
[14:52] but
[14:54] i i always thought that we were supposed
[14:56] to be
[14:57] our emphasis was to be placed upon who
[14:59] came to brother branham right amen
[15:03] not whether or not brother brown came to
[15:05] john
[15:06] but who came to brother branham
[15:09] you know to bring us the revelation
[15:13] that's right all right
[15:15] and you know
[15:18] i i how did the revelation get to to
[15:21] brother branham to be able to take it to
[15:23] john
[15:25] he's someone who's a prophet that's
[15:26] that's all right
[15:28] so we're
[15:29] a lot of in the bible prophets
[15:31] but they were not able to
[15:33] uh
[15:34] bring forth
[15:36] only that that god
[15:39] had revealed unto them
[15:42] you agree
[15:43] amen amen and in doing that then
[15:46] uh see
[15:48] are we concerned of who came to john
[15:51] or who came to brother brown right and
[15:54] the main emphasis to me is should be put
[15:56] on
[15:57] what was brought
[16:00] you know
[16:01] and you know we put the emphasis on who
[16:03] done what
[16:05] well
[16:06] you know i i've never thought any of the
[16:09] prophets
[16:10] wanted to take any glory or honor
[16:14] i thought they all wanted to give their
[16:16] honor and glory to the lord himself
[16:19] all right see and maybe you say well
[16:20] brother branham you know
[16:23] right around said this man i agree with
[16:25] you we're going to read it because i
[16:26] don't mind reading it to you
[16:29] but i'm just asking you the question are
[16:31] we putting our emphasis upon
[16:34] who came to who
[16:37] you know
[16:39] well is that going to change us
[16:41] if we know
[16:43] that that was brother branham they'd
[16:45] come to join on patents
[16:47] would that change us
[16:51] see
[16:52] i want to know what was took to john
[16:54] right
[16:55] amen
[16:57] i want to know what john got all right
[17:00] here you go come on
[17:01] all right
[17:02] go john then wrote
[17:04] what he got
[17:06] right right
[17:09] you know he wrote down what he got he
[17:11] penned it brother brown called him in
[17:13] the church age book a scribe
[17:17] john was described not the author right
[17:20] right that's right of the book of
[17:22] revelation amen
[17:25] the author is the lord jesus christ amen
[17:28] we'll get down to that that's right i'm
[17:30] just laying a point to you
[17:33] then
[17:33] my emphasis my point is upon
[17:37] whatever came to john by whoever brought
[17:39] it to john
[17:41] would be be able to come back to me
[17:44] to where i can get to revelation right
[17:48] and uh i want to put another point right
[17:51] here if i as you i've jot this down
[17:55] and i'm not against anybody that
[17:56] believes anything i'm just trying to say
[17:58] when i believe and let it go
[18:00] but i just ask simple questions
[18:02] to me they're simple that's because
[18:04] that's my simplicity of thinking
[18:09] even if it was true
[18:11] that john came as i said brother around
[18:14] came to john on papa's
[18:17] now that was only the writing
[18:22] of the book
[18:25] now listen to it
[18:28] you have to agree because that's what it
[18:30] says
[18:34] all right then
[18:36] if we don't get the revelation
[18:40] of what is written in the book
[18:44] then we don't have it right
[18:50] now
[18:53] i'll quote this again in a minute
[18:56] no man can reveal anything to you
[19:00] or me
[19:01] that's right
[19:03] the holy ghost brother brown christ mr
[19:05] god revealed we'll get to it a minute
[19:07] said the holy ghost is the only revealer
[19:09] of the word
[19:11] all right
[19:12] now so if it was brother branham it came
[19:15] to john and told him these things that's
[19:17] only the writing of the book right
[19:21] that's right you get me
[19:22] come on i turned black and white that's
[19:25] the writing of the book man that's right
[19:27] but see we've got to know what's
[19:29] revealed right
[19:31] the book has got to be revealed
[19:33] right
[19:36] so then
[19:37] we've got to be able to get it from the
[19:39] book
[19:41] right right after the book is written
[19:46] sealed up and finished until the end
[19:48] time
[19:50] see because john was the last one
[19:51] writing 1895-96 writing the book of
[19:53] revelation
[19:55] all right so if he was the finality or
[19:57] the finish or the writing of the book
[20:00] well then what would it matter if who
[20:03] came to john
[20:05] to bring him the the ability to write
[20:08] the book
[20:10] i want to know who can take the book
[20:13] and god can come down into his hands and
[20:17] unfold the book unto me right all right
[20:20] amen
[20:21] and be able then to let me see what the
[20:23] book says
[20:25] all right
[20:26] and we know for a certainty we believe
[20:28] brother random done that that's right
[20:30] right
[20:32] right but he was the one to come to
[20:34] break because he's the finality of the
[20:35] prophets
[20:37] oh i agree with that 100 see so then
[20:39] what i want to do is find what brother
[20:41] branham
[20:44] see
[20:46] would bring to you and i right
[20:49] but still
[20:51] even though we can hold the books
[20:54] i don't have one out here with me as a
[20:55] spoken word book but i have a lot of
[20:57] quotes here
[20:58] even though we could have that
[21:01] does that mean we understand come on
[21:05] no it's going to take the holy spirit
[21:07] amen that's right to reveal right
[21:11] what he's saying
[21:13] right
[21:14] all right
[21:14] see then that way we're not concerned
[21:16] with who's bringing who to what right
[21:20] i'm not that's right my concern is is to
[21:24] be able to let the holy spirit
[21:26] take what has been brought
[21:31] and
[21:32] let it be spoken to me by revelation
[21:35] all right
[21:36] because only the revelation will do me
[21:38] any good
[21:40] all right
[21:41] and i talked with with one brother
[21:43] personally about this that i know his
[21:45] pastor believed it no
[21:47] but
[21:49] i just told her brother i said
[21:52] i can't see that i'm just honest i can't
[21:54] see what y'all are talking about
[21:57] and i'll get on into it in a minute on
[21:59] the emphasis part of it but
[22:01] you know
[22:03] are you you're getting the point now out
[22:04] there some people on the internet be
[22:06] listening
[22:08] what's the most important
[22:11] who came to john
[22:15] or what
[22:16] was written by john
[22:19] from ever who came to him and then
[22:21] brother branham would be the one that
[22:23] would come to bring to us in this day
[22:28] what was written back there by whoever
[22:30] delivered or whatever took place amen
[22:34] you know that puts the emphasis right
[22:35] back upon the prophet's message right
[22:37] amen
[22:39] and bringing it down to a point then
[22:41] that we should look at it and see
[22:44] that the most important thing is to see
[22:46] the revelation
[22:50] not to see who brought what
[22:52] right because this bible is not the
[22:54] revelation of brother brown
[22:56] right
[22:57] right
[22:58] no more than
[22:59] john was the
[23:01] even john was not the author of the
[23:03] prophet said right
[23:04] that's right he said he was described
[23:07] you know what a scribe does
[23:09] he records what he sees or her or
[23:13] whatever
[23:14] so john recorded it all the way through
[23:17] and as he was recording it
[23:20] he was bringing it down to you and i
[23:22] okay now as i said
[23:25] a lot of emphasis is placed upon that
[23:27] and people believe that brother brown
[23:28] came to join on facmus because of him
[23:30] being the prophet
[23:32] all right
[23:34] there is another side of the view that i
[23:35] would hold closer to but you notice i
[23:37] said a whole closer to
[23:39] i wouldn't say agree with it 100
[23:42] but some people believe that
[23:45] that john was translated over into this
[23:48] day
[23:52] and saw
[23:54] brother branham
[23:56] and the opening of the seals
[24:00] and went back and wrote
[24:02] you know he was translated over into
[24:05] and brought over
[24:07] but now
[24:08] he
[24:10] the reason i don't go wholly with that
[24:11] is one point too that
[24:14] it would put
[24:15] too much emphasis upon the transmitting
[24:19] and the doings of who is what and who's
[24:21] coming to who
[24:22] instead of being the emphasis upon the
[24:24] lord jesus christ
[24:26] and he is revealing to you and i
[24:29] the word of
[24:31] all god
[24:32] now
[24:33] so let's just take some things that
[24:35] has been said and
[24:37] and let's just see what brother ronald
[24:39] had to say about this point
[24:41] here of the isle of patmos go ahead
[24:43] brothers pull up number one
[24:46] i don't know where it's warm out there
[24:48] or not but it is up here
[24:50] so if you could at least turn the fan on
[24:53] and give it a little
[24:55] a little higher stirring
[24:58] now look this is on them
[25:00] this is on the the revelation of jesus
[25:02] christ the series brought around preach
[25:05] of the church ages
[25:07] you know preaching 1960 1204 the morning
[25:10] service paragraph 113
[25:12] and we'll read this scripture in just a
[25:14] minute to tie together with it
[25:16] and see what we're talking about
[25:19] then we find out that when john started
[25:21] to worship the angel the angel said see
[25:23] that you do it not
[25:26] revelation 22 i believe it is and he
[25:28] said for i am of thy fellow servants
[25:31] and of the prophets now watch it
[25:34] it might have been elijah
[25:38] it might have been one of the prophets
[25:42] john was an apostle
[25:45] but this prophet was sent
[25:47] and john being apostle
[25:49] looked at the nature of the rest of his
[25:52] epistle all right let's go over there
[25:53] and read this that he's talking about
[25:55] revelation 22 9
[26:00] and we'll start from there
[26:02] so that we'll have the point of it
[26:09] will
[26:10] start eight verse i guess
[26:13] because in a minute i'm gonna drop all
[26:15] the way back up come on way down
[26:18] verse eight said and i john saw these
[26:20] things and hurt them and when i had
[26:22] heard them i fell down to worship before
[26:24] the feet of the angel which showed me
[26:26] these things
[26:28] and he said unto me see thou do it not
[26:30] for i am thy fellow servant and of thy
[26:34] brethren the prophets and of them which
[26:36] keep the sayings of this book
[26:38] worship god all right
[26:42] now
[26:43] brother branham said
[26:45] it could have been elijah
[26:48] or
[26:50] could have been one of the prophets
[26:54] that come to join on balance
[26:57] okay
[26:58] now let's go on over
[27:03] and let's get the next one this is the
[27:05] one everybody likes to use
[27:07] which is taken from the
[27:09] paragraph 59 of excuse me paragraph 201
[27:13] basically over to 209 or the 5th cl63
[27:15] 322
[27:17] and watch what he said
[27:20] he said have you caught anything i just
[27:22] wondered if you was
[27:24] yes you see yes sir i might not have to
[27:26] tell you then sunday
[27:28] notice note it's wonderful now notice
[27:31] now and then according to the the time
[27:33] that god was going to deliver to
[27:34] andalugian world he said the eagle
[27:37] the time he was going to deliver israel
[27:39] sent the eagle do you believe that the
[27:41] time even on
[27:43] john
[27:44] do you believe that the time even on
[27:47] john on the isle of patmos this message
[27:49] was so perfect that he couldn't trust it
[27:51] with an angel
[27:53] okay i want you
[27:57] you know an angel is a messenger right
[28:01] but do you know
[28:02] the messenger was a prophet
[28:05] you believe that let's prove it
[28:06] revelation 22
[28:08] let's see if it was an eagle so he was
[28:11] sure he was an angel
[28:13] he was a messenger
[28:14] but it was a prophet that revealed this
[28:16] whole book of revelations to him
[28:19] come on now it was a prophet
[28:22] that revealed it come on amen now
[28:30] see then
[28:31] we take what they are reading and saying
[28:33] well now
[28:35] you know
[28:41] in the days of
[28:43] the undeluviation
[28:45] he didn't send it by an angel
[28:47] he said by an eagle
[28:50] all right
[28:52] now brother branham was the seventh
[28:54] church age messenger that's right right
[28:57] he was the seventh angel you agree
[29:01] all right
[29:03] so now you see where it is laying down
[29:05] what brother branham is saying
[29:08] you see it was an eagle
[29:11] sure he was an angel he was a messenger
[29:14] but he was a prophet that revealed the
[29:16] book
[29:18] so now you're dealing with an eagle and
[29:20] an angel
[29:23] all right
[29:25] now
[29:26] was brother branham
[29:29] the son of man
[29:33] he said he wasn't
[29:34] that's right
[29:35] right
[29:36] he said it was a son of man
[29:38] we'll get to that in just a minute
[29:41] was brother brown the prophet
[29:46] or was he one of the prophets
[29:49] right
[29:54] now the only prophet i know to be
[29:57] in order of understanding is
[30:00] the lord jesus christ
[30:03] in a prophetic ministry
[30:06] all right see then that way you'll look
[30:09] back and see why brother brown would say
[30:12] that if you don't see christ in every
[30:14] verse go back and read it again
[30:17] he said because you've missed it
[30:19] see all of those prophets was christ
[30:24] to the people
[30:27] and even in the book of acts you'll find
[30:30] that jesus was the one
[30:33] that spoke to john
[30:35] i mean to moses
[30:37] at the burning bush right
[30:41] because he said he said he was in the
[30:42] burning bush
[30:44] all right
[30:46] see then not jesus the flesh
[30:49] that's right because jesus the flesh
[30:50] wasn't in the burning bush
[30:54] you remember how i always tell you gee
[30:56] when i say jesus christ i don't mean
[30:58] jesus the flesh
[31:00] i'm not emphasizing the flesh none
[31:02] whatsoever when i say jesus christ i'm
[31:04] saying christ
[31:06] and saying that jesus is the only name
[31:08] of god
[31:10] you remember that that's right all right
[31:12] jesus being the only name of god so then
[31:15] when i say jesus christ i mean almighty
[31:17] god amen
[31:19] who was melchizedek almighty god
[31:22] amen
[31:24] but he was in a form right
[31:27] that's right
[31:29] okay
[31:31] so now that's where we're going to go
[31:32] through this and look at it
[31:35] so we read there that brother ryan would
[31:37] say shirts and he's a he's an eagle he's
[31:39] a prophet
[31:43] but now did brother branham i asked you
[31:46] see the best way to answer a question
[31:48] and ask a question
[31:50] okay
[31:52] and uh i ask you a simple question
[31:57] do you believe that brother brown in
[32:00] human flesh
[32:02] corporal body human flesh ever what you
[32:05] want to use the word for terminologies
[32:07] of what you want to use
[32:08] do you believe brother brown come to
[32:10] join on patmos
[32:13] in a physical body
[32:16] if you do you've totally got
[32:18] pre-existence
[32:19] in your understanding
[32:23] all right
[32:26] jesus the flesh man never came to
[32:29] melchizedek
[32:31] right
[32:32] right
[32:34] but the christ did right
[32:38] the christ came to melchizedek or
[32:40] watched melchizedek that's what he was
[32:42] right all right
[32:43] see now think those things over
[32:48] i wrote it like this tomorrow just to
[32:49] you i do not believe that brother
[32:51] branham in any earthly form
[32:54] could come to
[32:55] john on patmos that would be
[32:57] pre-existence
[32:59] of a human form
[33:01] all right so we would annihilate the
[33:03] fact that it could be a corporal
[33:05] physical mortal
[33:07] contact of any form right we would have
[33:09] to annihilate that out of our thinking
[33:12] so we've removed that
[33:13] now i know it ain't going to change
[33:14] nobody out there believing and if you
[33:16] believe it ain't going to change you
[33:18] but i'm just i just preach what i
[33:20] believe okay
[33:22] it's up to god to reveal it to you or
[33:23] anybody else
[33:25] they gonna change nobody because they're
[33:26] gonna say brother they don't even
[33:27] understand well i agree i don't
[33:28] understand that
[33:30] you know
[33:31] but
[33:32] maybe the lord does
[33:34] and uh
[33:35] but i just try to
[33:37] stir up your curiosity
[33:40] and hey and i i know the scriptures too
[33:42] a little bit you know not all of them
[33:44] but
[33:45] paul says questions gender strife
[33:51] i scripture
[33:55] now would brother brown contrary to that
[33:56] when he said questions made a strong
[33:58] church
[34:01] what was paul talking about about
[34:03] questions right
[34:08] do you think paul didn't want questions
[34:11] how could van anders told him that he
[34:13] didn't know what he was talking about
[34:14] when he was standing there said have you
[34:15] received a holy ghost since you believed
[34:17] it if ananias had can't ask questions
[34:20] and brother around says questions about
[34:22] the strong church
[34:25] see so now what's being said
[34:31] see paul
[34:32] didn't like endless genealogies
[34:36] and things
[34:37] but there's a truth to genealogies
[34:41] in lineages
[34:43] so decide for yourself
[34:48] so yeah at least i'll try to tell you
[34:50] what i believe what
[34:52] where most people are just i don't know
[34:56] i'm not gonna say nothing
[34:59] because i don't know
[35:01] well
[35:04] i just go ahead and open my mouth and
[35:05] remove all that so
[35:07] that way you can decide what i believe
[35:10] and then you can make up your mind
[35:13] i believe that brother branham was not
[35:16] the prophet
[35:18] right that's right that's right
[35:20] he was a prophet
[35:24] all right
[35:27] i don't believe it was a prophet
[35:30] well listen i don't believe that it was
[35:32] a prophet
[35:35] now do you understand the emphasis
[35:36] brother brown was deep was not the
[35:39] prophet he was a prophet brother branham
[35:41] was not the son of man he was a son of
[35:43] man
[35:45] that these sort of man come to
[35:47] all right so then i do not believe that
[35:50] a prophet
[35:51] a prophet small little one
[35:54] was the one that come to john
[35:57] on patmos
[35:59] i believe that was the prophet
[36:01] amen
[36:04] brother branham was not the prophet he
[36:06] was a prophet
[36:08] that the prophet the lord jesus christ
[36:10] came to
[36:12] brother adam was not the son of man
[36:16] we'll read one of these in just a moment
[36:19] he was a son of man
[36:21] that these son of man came to
[36:25] now to emphasize the point and you'll
[36:29] if i don't get it in remember this later
[36:33] why would a man like john the baptist
[36:37] when we
[36:38] know that he was in the spirit in the
[36:41] power of life right or elijah
[36:44] we know that he was elijah number three
[36:46] right
[36:48] you had elijah elijah with a double
[36:50] portion john the baptist coming to be to
[36:53] recognize this as uh isaiah 42
[36:56] and the one crying in the wilderness and
[36:58] different things and
[37:01] brother branham would be number four
[37:03] right right and then one of the two
[37:05] witnesses the elijah to the jews is
[37:07] number five all right
[37:09] now
[37:11] catch the emphasis
[37:13] john
[37:15] are you that prophet
[37:22] right now there's one or two things goes
[37:24] there
[37:26] john are you god
[37:28] that prophet
[37:34] now john
[37:36] are you elijah
[37:42] he said huh
[37:44] no
[37:46] i'm the voice of one crying in the
[37:48] wilderness right
[37:52] now if that said john
[37:54] are you part
[37:56] of that ministry of elijah amen this
[37:58] come five times in the bible
[38:01] john would have said
[38:02] yep i kind of believe i am one of them
[38:06] because my ministry would relate to it
[38:10] all right
[38:11] but yet he denies it
[38:14] so they say john okay who are you
[38:18] he said i'm the voice of one crying in
[38:19] the wilderness isaiah 42 i think it is
[38:23] which identified him to be
[38:26] the elijah
[38:27] ministry
[38:29] of that day
[38:31] you agree
[38:33] all right
[38:34] but he was not
[38:36] elijah
[38:40] he was not elisha
[38:44] he was not the elijah to the gentiles in
[38:46] the last days
[38:48] and he he was not the elijah to be the
[38:50] number fifth coming
[38:52] right
[38:55] because if he said yes i am elijah that
[38:57] would have covered the whole time
[39:00] yet he identified himself in the
[39:02] scriptures that's right and they said
[39:04] brother adam are you that alive jesus
[39:07] now i i never said that
[39:09] a lot of people say that about it
[39:14] he said brother branham identify
[39:15] yourself he's okay malachi 4.
[39:19] if my identification luke 17 30 is my
[39:21] identification
[39:23] it would identify the gentile coming
[39:26] of the spirit of elijah to be according
[39:29] to malachi 4 and luke 17 30 revelation
[39:32] 10 7.
[39:34] all right so you'll see the emphasis in
[39:36] a minute when we come back to it
[39:40] but who was elijah
[39:44] the spirit who is the spirit in elisha
[39:48] who was the spirit in john the baptist
[39:52] who is the spirit that was in brother
[39:53] branham
[39:54] who is the spirit that would be in
[40:00] one of the two witnesses that goes to
[40:01] israel
[40:03] it would be as we'll read in a minute
[40:06] it would be the spirit of prophecy
[40:11] amen
[40:13] it would be the christ
[40:16] deep prophet
[40:18] not a prophet right
[40:21] just one of them couldn't identify as
[40:23] being all of it all right that's right
[40:25] that's right are you listening
[40:27] elijah couldn't be allowed elijah
[40:29] couldn't be all of it brother brown
[40:31] couldn't be all of it
[40:33] right john the baptist couldn't be all
[40:35] of it neither could the one coming
[40:47] is the one that was in all of them
[40:50] and that the prophet now listen cause
[40:52] we're gonna quote this in a minute and
[40:54] we're gonna get to something he said
[40:56] the prophet is not jesus
[40:59] right amen now you're gonna catch that
[41:01] one so hold on to it
[41:07] see
[41:08] jesus was almighty god
[41:10] right amen
[41:14] and brother brown they asked him said
[41:16] was why wouldn't jesus accept worship
[41:19] he said that wasn't jesus
[41:25] no baptism he said that was jesus
[41:33] the hmm was so careful in his answers
[41:35] until he laid it perfectly in order
[41:39] because that was not jesus
[41:44] the prophet
[41:48] is the prophetic ministry of the lord
[41:51] jesus christ
[41:53] amen
[41:55] but jesus is the flesh
[41:57] right and jesus is the name of god
[42:04] so you gotta leave it that that profit
[42:05] could be
[42:07] just exactly like we went through the
[42:09] godhead
[42:13] right around and said god stepped over
[42:15] in another form
[42:18] and became the son
[42:20] amen
[42:21] to create the world
[42:29] see not another god
[42:31] man
[42:32] the same god in another form
[42:36] so the prophet that was in elijah elijah
[42:39] john the baptist bled around him and
[42:41] being the end time
[42:44] would be the prophet
[42:50] because he's the god god of all the
[42:52] prophets is the lord jesus christ amen
[42:54] all right now once
[43:03] let's just start reading we'll read a
[43:04] few of these things that i've already
[43:06] quoted go ahead brother
[43:08] the number
[43:10] four
[43:14] number four in this retail
[43:18] no women we got back up
[43:20] we go back up to numbers
[43:23] we go back up to number
[43:24] three i don't want to get this one in
[43:27] that word that somebody wouldn't come
[43:28] along and say wait a minute now this is
[43:29] that or the other
[43:31] let's get it lay it in there let's make
[43:33] your own decision this is paragraph 59
[43:36] questions and answers
[43:38] uh book number four which you'll find
[43:40] this 1175 in your
[43:43] um
[43:44] see a book
[43:46] i mean cld book excuse me 11 75 right
[43:49] all right 64 8 34 which is question and
[43:52] actually book four paragraph 59
[43:56] and see they're asking a question dear
[43:58] dear brother would jesus not accept
[44:00] worship in revelation by john when he
[44:02] failed to
[44:03] why would not jesus receive worship in
[44:05] revelations by john when when he allowed
[44:09] worship before
[44:11] would not jesus receive the worship and
[44:13] you know why would he do it when he was
[44:16] he allowed worship before
[44:18] him
[44:19] why wouldn't jesus receive worship when
[44:21] john wanted to
[44:23] worship him
[44:26] now look what he said my dear brother
[44:28] sister whoever it is it was not jesus
[44:31] that would not receive worship in
[44:33] revelations 22 8 that's the scripture we
[44:36] read
[44:38] you'll read it was the prophet
[44:41] angel
[44:42] who would not receive worship
[44:44] when john fell down to worship the angel
[44:46] that had showed him these things he said
[44:49] see that you do it not
[44:51] for i am of thy fellow brethren
[44:54] i am one of the prophets see see i am
[44:57] thy fellow brethren thy fellow servant
[44:59] one of the prophets give worship to god
[45:01] it wasn't jesus didn't accept it it was
[45:04] the prophet wouldn't accept it okay
[45:08] now
[45:10] but you're gonna have to go back and
[45:11] read matthew martin luke and john
[45:14] because surely you've heard me say this
[45:16] statement there was times in jesus's
[45:19] life that he would not accept worship
[45:22] you agree right right man what the bible
[45:24] says
[45:25] you wouldn't let him worship you
[45:27] yeah
[45:28] that was when he was alive
[45:30] but then it was time to do worship and
[45:31] he'd accept it
[45:33] why
[45:36] because he knew what they were doing
[45:38] one of them was looking at the flesh the
[45:40] other one was looking to the god in the
[45:41] flesh
[45:43] one was wanting to worship god in the
[45:44] flesh he would allow that but the other
[45:46] was trying to worship the flesh and he
[45:48] refused to accept it in the flesh
[45:54] so now it wasn't jesus
[46:00] come to join oppatmus no i don't agree i
[46:02] don't i don't believe it was jesus
[46:08] i believe it was the prophetic ministry
[46:11] of the lord jesus christ
[46:14] which would be as i asked the brother
[46:16] the simple question
[46:18] i said why do you want it to be one man
[46:23] one prophet
[46:26] why not make it the prophet
[46:30] which would cover every prophet in the
[46:32] bible
[46:34] the prophet is moses abraham
[46:40] name of all the prophets right
[46:42] that's the prophet
[46:45] which was the spirit of prophecy
[46:48] in a man
[46:53] and that spirit of prophecy in a man
[46:57] could have received worship but would
[46:59] not allow it
[47:00] because none of those prophets would
[47:02] allow worship
[47:03] of them
[47:06] all right
[47:07] and follow me we're going a little
[47:08] further
[47:10] but donnie said he was listening i
[47:11] forgot how many times on one teddy but i
[47:13] preached since 82 or 83 so maybe you
[47:16] don't want to listen to this one over
[47:18] and over a few times
[47:20] because i'll try to say what i can the
[47:22] best that i can
[47:23] but then
[47:24] you know
[47:25] if you misunderstand what i'm saying
[47:27] because your computer went
[47:28] you know over on another track right now
[47:30] and you're running backwards and forth
[47:33] on track two and i'm gonna track one see
[47:35] it all gets muddled up and you don't
[47:37] understand what i'm trying to say
[47:39] all right
[47:40] but look at the next one look at number
[47:42] four now let's just get down to it this
[47:44] is we quoted it we will put it on this
[47:46] tape
[47:48] this is from chrysler mystery god reveal
[47:49] paragraph 318 1963 728 and notice the
[47:53] holy ghost is the only revealer of the
[47:55] divine revelation of christ
[47:57] there is no school can do it no scholar
[48:00] can do it no man
[48:01] how well educated how godly or anything
[48:04] else there is no man
[48:07] can do it
[48:09] no man can reveal anything to you
[48:12] right
[48:14] jesus said
[48:16] quote
[48:17] brother branham
[48:20] right do you need this quote
[48:22] jesus said my own life
[48:25] did not reveal that unto thee
[48:28] but my father when jesus when peter said
[48:30] thou art the christ
[48:32] matthew 13 16 or 16 13 that which way it
[48:35] goes and he said dart the christ the son
[48:37] of the living god he said flesh blood
[48:39] didn't reveal it right around said my
[48:41] own life
[48:43] did not reveal that to him to thee
[48:47] that's what i asked the question one of
[48:48] those see
[48:52] even if it was brother branham that went
[48:54] to john o'balance
[48:56] that is only the writing of the book
[49:04] see then you've got to get something
[49:05] coming from dire to brother branham
[49:08] right
[49:09] back here on earth
[49:12] to let him preach it to us right
[49:15] and then the holy ghost can reveal it
[49:17] because the holy ghost couldn't reveal
[49:18] it what was written in the book
[49:20] come on show me did
[49:23] you know i'm right
[49:26] the holy ghost couldn't reveal the book
[49:28] of revelations only impartial things
[49:32] right
[49:33] until this prophet came
[49:35] that's right
[49:37] all right
[49:39] see because light had not shined in on
[49:41] you remember the pyramid and the things
[49:43] of the dreams and the cutting the top
[49:45] off and looking down in and all of that
[49:47] tied in together
[49:49] right
[49:52] because right around can't reveal
[49:53] anything nope
[49:54] that's right jesus said in my own life
[49:58] didn't reveal that unto peter but my
[50:00] father which is in heaven revealed it
[50:04] amen
[50:06] so i think her emphasis is placed upon
[50:08] the wrong thing
[50:12] even if we could prove that brother
[50:13] brown congregant on batman's that's just
[50:16] the writing in the book i hope you're
[50:17] following me
[50:22] that would seal it up and we couldn't
[50:24] get it what
[50:27] i want to know who come to brother brown
[50:34] he said well i know that show
[50:38] same way it went to john come to bread
[50:40] around one out down over here
[50:42] in tucson arizona and told him to go
[50:44] back home
[50:47] didn't tell him what the seals were come
[50:49] on show me he did
[50:51] go back home it'll be revealed to you
[50:53] what they play he comes back
[50:55] he said i on the breach and the
[50:58] guardians implicitly he said i do not
[51:00] know what that first seal is
[51:03] you said yes you did well you make him a
[51:05] liar somewhere
[51:15] he said i'm waiting on him amen
[51:19] all right
[51:20] i threw out the seal book study it
[51:23] run around was waiting on somebody amen
[51:26] surely when he gets down to the end he
[51:28] said i wish somebody would have caught
[51:30] what's been going on this week he said
[51:32] it's not been the angels of the it's not
[51:35] been
[51:36] nothing in me said it's been the angels
[51:38] of the lord
[51:44] bringing me back he said here for this
[51:45] tonight
[51:48] okay
[51:50] let's see these up by making sure people
[51:52] on the internet can read them go to
[51:54] number five
[51:56] questions and extra book two 1964.
[52:00] some say brother brown is the son of man
[52:02] i thought the pillar fire was the son of
[52:03] man
[52:04] am i mistaken well that's a good
[52:06] question very good
[52:07] but i am not the son of man
[52:10] but a son of man
[52:11] there's quite a difference
[52:14] jesus christ was the son of man son of
[52:16] god son of man son of david
[52:19] he said the question was there and all
[52:20] the things he said i am not the
[52:23] anointed son of man i don't claim to be
[52:26] his prophet many times i said it when i
[52:28] didn't think i said it and catch myself
[52:31] on the tape then he goes explain to the
[52:33] prophet is the new testament preacher
[52:34] well i you know he's he's all right he's
[52:36] explaining what's going on
[52:39] but he's not the son of man
[52:46] jesus was these other man
[52:51] but jesus was the word made flesh which
[52:53] was god in human flesh right the lord
[52:56] jesus christ right amen
[52:59] not this jesus a man
[53:03] he was the lord jesus christ
[53:05] he was god almighty in human flesh
[53:09] right
[53:12] come on
[53:15] look at the next one
[53:16] this is off anointed once the end time
[53:19] 1965 725
[53:21] paragraph 258
[53:23] and then the very day that the son of
[53:24] man is revealed
[53:26] revelation 10 1-7 read it when you're on
[53:29] the seventh angel's message opening the
[53:31] seals what is it not the angel is the
[53:34] son of man but the messenger is
[53:36] revealing the son of man amen did you
[53:39] get it can you get it separated now
[53:42] that's where it seems to be so hard for
[53:44] you you see
[53:45] not the son of man self but to sell it
[53:48] angel the seventh messenger is revealing
[53:50] to the public the son of man because
[53:52] it's left to shove it can't organize
[53:55] it's the grain
[53:57] it's a itself again
[54:00] all right
[54:01] he said well we're going down there it
[54:03] says it that the son of man was
[54:05] revealing
[54:07] who is the son of man
[54:09] we just established brother and said he
[54:11] was not the son of man
[54:15] so there was a church ace messenger
[54:18] there was an angel
[54:20] right
[54:22] but he was born a profit
[54:26] but being born to profit didn't make him
[54:27] decent a man right
[54:29] yeah it didn't come out
[54:32] what you meant as we go to the next one
[54:33] paragraph 269 and then 91.
[54:37] i wasn't the one that appeared down on
[54:39] the river
[54:40] i was only standing there when he
[54:42] appeared
[54:44] i'm not the one that performs these
[54:46] things and foretells these things and
[54:48] happens as perfect they are
[54:50] things that happen as perfect as they
[54:52] are i'm on i'm only one that's near when
[54:55] he does it
[54:56] i was only a voice that he used to say
[54:59] it it wasn't what i knew it's what i
[55:02] just surrendered myself to
[55:06] that he spoke through
[55:08] it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel
[55:11] oh no it was the manifestation of the
[55:14] son of man it wasn't the angel his
[55:17] message it was the mystery
[55:19] that god unfolded it's not a man it's
[55:22] god the angel was not the son of man he
[55:25] was a messenger from the son of man the
[55:27] son of man is christ
[55:30] what is he
[55:34] the son of man is christ he is the one
[55:37] that you're feeding on you're not
[55:39] feeding on a man
[55:40] a man his words will fail but you're
[55:43] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[55:46] the son of man now brother branham was
[55:48] not what we were feeding him
[55:51] he's the one that god used i says plain
[55:54] is what he says
[55:56] that's right but he used him to bring us
[55:57] the message of what
[55:59] this prophet took to john on paper
[56:04] a lot of people think that what happened
[56:06] was it was brother brown's now this is
[56:07] another thought it goes in they think
[56:09] that brother brown's theophany was
[56:11] translated over into
[56:13] and saw these things
[56:17] you take over what thoughts you want to
[56:20] i'm not against any other
[56:24] i'm not against anybody in their beliefs
[56:25] you believe what you want to you have a
[56:27] right to
[56:28] but what i'm trying to tell you my
[56:30] emphasis is upon the lord jesus christ
[56:33] because he's the only revealer of the
[56:35] word
[56:38] and if this was brother brown that come
[56:39] to john on patmos
[56:42] i still want to know what that who told
[56:44] him something on pass right
[56:48] because what he told john was just the
[56:50] writing of the book
[56:52] i hope you catch that right no matter
[56:55] what you think about who come to what
[56:57] that was the writing of the book
[56:59] right
[57:00] this is in the day of the revealing of
[57:02] the book
[57:04] man
[57:07] see that's what everybody thinks they
[57:08] think that that brother brown in some
[57:10] theology form went there and saw this
[57:13] and come back why not just lay down as
[57:15] simple as what he said
[57:17] he said i don't know what those seals
[57:18] are
[57:19] that's right
[57:21] that's what he said read it
[57:23] he even said on the first field he said
[57:25] i've made a horrible mistake today if
[57:27] the holy spirit hadn't straightened me
[57:29] out on something my sister said read the
[57:31] first seal and say
[57:33] but that's where people won't do it they
[57:35] won't go read to see what the prophet
[57:36] said but then they'll just turn around i
[57:38] don't believe you
[57:39] don't believe what
[57:41] you don't even know what your story is
[57:45] at least get down and read the book
[57:51] then it might give a better
[57:52] understanding
[57:58] let's read this
[58:01] now there's three times
[58:03] so go to revelation one
[58:05] there's three times in the book of
[58:07] revelations
[58:08] that an angel
[58:10] appears to john
[58:12] now
[58:13] are you going to make that three
[58:14] different angels that's your choice
[58:18] there's three times in the book of
[58:19] revelation one is revelations one
[58:23] that an angel appears to john
[58:27] all right
[58:28] now let's just
[58:31] let's just take them out of the way
[58:33] let's go along and then maybe when we
[58:35] get to the end we'll have a better
[58:36] understanding
[58:38] revelations
[58:39] 1
[58:43] uh
[58:44] verse 10 i was in the spirit on the lord
[58:45] today i heard behind me of great voices
[58:47] of a trumpet saying and what the voice
[58:49] say look sir red letter say
[58:51] i am alpha and omega the first and the
[58:53] last and what thou see is writing the
[58:55] book and sending them to the seven
[58:57] churches which are in asia and to
[58:58] emphasis in the smyrna under murderers
[59:00] under
[59:01] tatara and consortist under philadelphia
[59:03] and under leicester and once and i
[59:05] turned to see the voice that's fake with
[59:07] me
[59:08] and being turned i saw seven golden
[59:10] candlestick and he turns to see the
[59:11] voice
[59:13] he sees seven golden candlesticks and in
[59:15] the midst of the seven candlesticks one
[59:17] life unto the son of man clothed with a
[59:18] garment down to the foot and gird about
[59:21] the pouch
[59:22] with a golden girdle
[59:24] now i've done preach to you over and
[59:25] over who that is that brother and says
[59:27] it that's the bride of jesus christ
[59:29] comes gerd about the pouch it's finished
[59:32] that's god because it's like another son
[59:34] of man he didn't save us on a man what
[59:36] life about the son of man
[59:37] the reed his head and his hair was white
[59:39] like wool that's why the snow and his
[59:41] eyes were flame of fire his feet like a
[59:43] defined bryce as if they burned in a
[59:45] furnace and his voice as the sound of
[59:48] many waters wrote around said many
[59:50] preachers witnesses page 57 church had
[59:52] booked he had his right hand seven stars
[59:55] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[59:56] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[59:58] as the sun shineth in his strength and
[1:00:01] when i saw him i fell at his feet is
[1:00:03] dead
[1:00:04] and he laid his right hand up on me
[1:00:06] saying unto me
[1:00:09] now look you do you have a red letter
[1:00:11] edition of the bible
[1:00:13] a red letter edition means jesus is
[1:00:15] speaking and does everybody understand
[1:00:17] that one
[1:00:20] god is speaking
[1:00:22] right
[1:00:24] so who's his talking now
[1:00:26] the one he falls at his feet says fear
[1:00:28] not i am the first in the lifestyle he
[1:00:30] that liveth and was dead and behold i am
[1:00:32] alive forevermore amen and how the keys
[1:00:34] are hell and death so we know for
[1:00:35] certain that wouldn't run around
[1:00:38] right
[1:00:40] i mean i solved that problem number one
[1:00:43] okay
[1:00:46] let's see
[1:00:50] go to go ahead and go over number eight
[1:00:54] which is revelation jesus christ church
[1:00:56] 8 book page 13.
[1:00:57] so we'll get this one out of the way and
[1:00:59] then we can go on to our talk
[1:01:01] this book is usually termed a revelation
[1:01:03] in saint john now the prayer the
[1:01:05] paragraph above this one is where
[1:01:07] brother brown says john
[1:01:09] was not a
[1:01:11] uh of the author of the book of
[1:01:13] revelation he's a scribe
[1:01:15] it's the paragraph above this if you
[1:01:17] want to read it go get your church egg
[1:01:18] book this book is usually turned to
[1:01:20] revelation of saint john but that is
[1:01:22] incorrect it is the revelation of jesus
[1:01:24] christ given to john for the christians
[1:01:26] of all ages it is the only book in the
[1:01:29] entire bible that is written by jesus
[1:01:30] himself through personally appearing to
[1:01:34] a scribe
[1:01:37] yeah now
[1:01:38] right
[1:01:40] he did say jesus he's jesus christ
[1:01:44] jesus himself written
[1:01:46] that he's talking about not just a flesh
[1:01:48] man
[1:01:49] going down to the next one number nine
[1:01:51] paragraph
[1:01:52] 110 the seven church ages 54 5
[1:01:55] 12. and then he looked upon jesus and
[1:01:57] had seven rainbows above and he was in
[1:02:00] which which was god's covenant and he
[1:02:02] was standing in the midst of the seven
[1:02:03] golden candlestick he was to look upon
[1:02:05] his jasper and charter stone jasper was
[1:02:07] ruben and sardis stone was the benjamin
[1:02:10] that was the first in the lights of the
[1:02:12] patriarchs that alpha and omega the
[1:02:14] beginning and the ending and there were
[1:02:16] seven rainbow colors seven church ages
[1:02:18] the covenant with him and his and the
[1:02:20] seven
[1:02:21] golden candlesticks with the seven stars
[1:02:24] oh what a picture if we get to it after
[1:02:26] a while maybe the lord willing all right
[1:02:28] alpha and omega the beginning in the end
[1:02:30] and said the lord which which is which
[1:02:32] was and which is to come the almighty
[1:02:34] who is he
[1:02:36] what's this revelation of
[1:02:39] jesus christ
[1:02:41] and here he's not a prophet
[1:02:43] here he is the almighty god manifested
[1:02:49] the alpha and omega
[1:02:52] i am a from a to z i am he that was
[1:02:55] which is and shall come i am the
[1:02:57] almighty pretty clear isn't it no chance
[1:02:59] of controversy there lord which was
[1:03:01] which is so then we know for certain
[1:03:03] revelations one
[1:03:06] could have been brother brown
[1:03:09] it was god himself right
[1:03:13] let's say in bride form
[1:03:15] all right
[1:03:19] that was vision 60 1960 1204 paragraph
[1:03:23] 257
[1:03:25] and when i saw him i felt his feet dead
[1:03:27] my the prophet couldn't stand no more
[1:03:29] see such a vision he just he just
[1:03:31] snapped
[1:03:33] his strength
[1:03:34] and he fell right down on his feet as
[1:03:36] dead now watch and they laid his right
[1:03:38] hand upon him saying unto
[1:03:41] the right hand upon me saying say unto
[1:03:43] me fear not i am the first in the light
[1:03:45] oh my not a prophet god see no it's not
[1:03:49] a prophet this is god i am the first in
[1:03:51] the life
[1:03:52] i'm the first of the resurrection the
[1:03:53] life of the resurrect i am he that was
[1:03:56] he that is and that will come all right
[1:03:58] now
[1:04:00] so we'll take that one out of the way
[1:04:04] and we'll pull that one apart
[1:04:07] set it aside
[1:04:09] if that was not
[1:04:10] brought around that was god okay
[1:04:13] jump over now in revelations the second
[1:04:16] time this is used
[1:04:18] is revelations 19.
[1:04:23] revelations 19.
[1:04:25] i don't know
[1:04:26] don't get these up because
[1:04:33] relations 19 we'll start reading from
[1:04:35] verse 5.
[1:04:38] the voice came out of this room
[1:04:41] and watch and the voice came out of the
[1:04:43] throne
[1:04:44] where's the voice coming from
[1:04:47] out of the throne
[1:04:48] right
[1:04:50] say praise our guard all you saints and
[1:04:52] all and ye that fear him both small and
[1:04:54] great and i heard it where's the voice
[1:04:56] of a great multitude and that's the
[1:04:57] voice of many waters and that's the
[1:04:59] voice of mighty thunderings saying
[1:05:01] hallelujah for the lord god of neptune
[1:05:03] reign let us be glad and rejoice and
[1:05:05] give honor to him for the marriage of
[1:05:06] the lamb has come and his wife has made
[1:05:09] herself ready
[1:05:11] and to her was granted that she should
[1:05:12] be ready to find linen clean and white
[1:05:14] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:05:16] of the science and he says unto me
[1:05:19] now who would this would have come out
[1:05:20] of the
[1:05:21] throne
[1:05:22] and he said unto me
[1:05:24] blessed are they which are called unto
[1:05:25] the marriage supper of the lamb he saith
[1:05:27] unto me these are the true sayings of
[1:05:29] god
[1:05:30] and i feel it is speak to
[1:05:34] worship and i failed to speak to worship
[1:05:37] him and he said i don't see thou do it
[1:05:38] not
[1:05:39] i am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:05:41] brethren that have the testimony of
[1:05:43] jesus
[1:05:45] worship god for the testimony of jesus
[1:05:48] is the spirit of prophecy
[1:05:51] all right
[1:05:53] so now
[1:05:54] that doesn't list us to being brought
[1:05:56] around
[1:05:58] that lists the testimony of jesus christ
[1:06:00] as i was saying a while ago all the
[1:06:02] prophets and the testimony of jesus
[1:06:05] christ
[1:06:06] you agree
[1:06:07] every prophet moses
[1:06:09] elijah
[1:06:11] john whatever you know
[1:06:13] all the prophets they were back there
[1:06:16] micah i wanted that that was the spirit
[1:06:18] of prophecy
[1:06:20] it was not the man right my brother said
[1:06:23] about isaiah
[1:06:26] isaiah said a virgin shall conceive
[1:06:29] he said now ain't that an odd thing for
[1:06:31] a man to say all right
[1:06:34] no
[1:06:35] i mean let me go into the photo don't
[1:06:36] you think isaiah probably went home said
[1:06:38] but i'm goofed up
[1:06:41] how can a virgin can see
[1:06:45] you see what he said was true
[1:06:47] all right it had to come to pass
[1:06:50] because it was a spirit of prophecy
[1:06:53] right
[1:06:54] something he had prophesied
[1:06:57] now
[1:07:00] brother gary and i were talking about
[1:07:01] this the other day
[1:07:05] see as long as you and i
[1:07:07] keep prophesying
[1:07:10] we're going to die
[1:07:12] i preached a sermon one time many years
[1:07:13] ago and i preached it and honestly i
[1:07:15] believe it those who prophesy i must die
[1:07:19] show me one in the bible that prophesied
[1:07:21] it didn't die right
[1:07:24] now you can say well the lord jesus come
[1:07:25] on that's almighty god don't don't talk
[1:07:27] to me i can't you know
[1:07:29] let's go get on them kind of
[1:07:31] flings
[1:07:32] i'm talking about in the prophets from
[1:07:34] the people
[1:07:38] you know that paul said
[1:07:39] if we change them on the twinkling i
[1:07:43] i've always told you i believe when
[1:07:45] paul's seen that he's seen it just as
[1:07:47] perfect that it will be the day that it
[1:07:50] takes place to you and me
[1:07:52] but he couldn't make it manifest there
[1:07:54] was no way to bring it that time it
[1:07:56] wasn't time
[1:07:58] so it was a prophecy
[1:07:59] but what he saw
[1:08:02] was the real thing right
[1:08:05] brother brown never come and got
[1:08:06] something different he got it from paul
[1:08:09] when naaman saw trash jostling in the
[1:08:11] street he saw buicks and oldsmobile
[1:08:13] running together in our day out on the
[1:08:15] highway running like lightning with you
[1:08:18] know headlights on
[1:08:19] you know what he saw it
[1:08:24] because they could be taken over and see
[1:08:25] those times
[1:08:26] right
[1:08:27] because that was the spirit of prophecy
[1:08:30] all right
[1:08:31] now
[1:08:33] so we know that
[1:08:35] the first time
[1:08:36] chapter one and chapter 19
[1:08:39] would not
[1:08:41] clarify enough to bring it to make it to
[1:08:43] be
[1:08:45] anything that brother brown was speaking
[1:08:46] of so now let's go over here and let's
[1:08:48] read this revelations 22 and we'll
[1:08:51] finish with this part
[1:08:53] and i'm going to say it again
[1:08:56] if you believe brother brown to be that
[1:08:58] that's fine
[1:08:59] i'm not going to argue with you
[1:09:03] but just take into consideration
[1:09:06] the things that we spoke of
[1:09:09] it should have been sensible enough of
[1:09:11] what we stated
[1:09:13] that there would be no way you could
[1:09:14] bring the human body
[1:09:17] corporal human physical body of brother
[1:09:20] branham over to john on papa's
[1:09:23] ill-regardless if you want to believe
[1:09:24] that was brought around to come to john
[1:09:26] you can't bring the body there that's
[1:09:28] pre-existence
[1:09:30] now you're getting it too far
[1:09:32] so you're going to have to back up away
[1:09:34] from the human mortal
[1:09:37] and back up into at least it had to be
[1:09:39] in some other form
[1:09:40] and see like i said they believe it was
[1:09:42] a theophany form that come across
[1:09:45] well
[1:09:46] that that's all right but just remember
[1:09:48] now and i know this is going to go
[1:09:50] contrary to what and we'll get to that
[1:09:52] doctrine eventually that most people
[1:09:54] think your theophanies off up in heaven
[1:09:56] somewhere
[1:09:57] come on bro
[1:10:01] brother around says your soul is your
[1:10:03] chaos
[1:10:07] okay
[1:10:08] we get back to that one don't have time
[1:10:10] tonight we'll get back to that one
[1:10:12] eventually
[1:10:13] and talk on
[1:10:15] so that if you're dealing with those
[1:10:17] type of things but let's just read
[1:10:18] revelations 22
[1:10:21] and just read and see what it actually
[1:10:23] say
[1:10:24] all right
[1:10:26] see then we'll see that i'm not trying
[1:10:28] to tear down what brother brown would
[1:10:29] say you can go ahead and pull it up you
[1:10:31] want to radical revelation 22.
[1:10:35] they doing good man
[1:10:40] so watch now i'll read from here because
[1:10:42] i want to stop and emphasize because
[1:10:44] these have been underlying for 40 years
[1:10:45] so you know i didn't make no nuance for
[1:10:48] this message
[1:10:51] and he showed me a pure river
[1:10:55] of water of life clear as crystal
[1:10:58] proceeding out of the throne of god
[1:11:00] another lamb now who showed it to it
[1:11:07] somebody
[1:11:10] showed this to john
[1:11:12] right
[1:11:14] okay
[1:11:16] you can back up over in another chapter
[1:11:19] pick up and see if it was an angel it's
[1:11:21] all right
[1:11:22] now watch
[1:11:23] in the midst of the street and on either
[1:11:25] side of the river with her
[1:11:26] the tree of life which by our twelve
[1:11:29] manner of fruits and yielded her fruit
[1:11:31] every month in the leaves of the tree
[1:11:32] was for the healing of the nations
[1:11:35] there shall be no more curse but the
[1:11:38] throne of god and the lamb
[1:11:40] shall be in it
[1:11:42] and his servant shall serve him
[1:11:45] and they shall see his face and his nine
[1:11:47] shall be in their foreheads
[1:11:50] and there shall be no not there
[1:11:52] and they need no candle neither light of
[1:11:54] them son
[1:11:56] for the lord god giveth them light and
[1:11:58] they shall reign forever and ever
[1:12:01] and he says unto me
[1:12:03] these sayings are faithful and true
[1:12:06] now remember revelations 21
[1:12:10] is the future home
[1:12:14] so this is own pies
[1:12:19] okay
[1:12:21] the future home is revelation 21.
[1:12:25] this is showing what's going to be in
[1:12:26] revelation 21.
[1:12:28] be no not there why lord god reigneth
[1:12:32] he says unto me these things are
[1:12:33] faithful and true and the lord the lord
[1:12:35] god of the holy prophets sent his angel
[1:12:39] unto his servants
[1:12:41] excuse me and sent his angel to show his
[1:12:44] servants the things which must shortly
[1:12:46] be done
[1:12:47] behold i come quickly
[1:12:50] now who's that
[1:12:53] blessed is he that keepeth the sayings
[1:12:55] of the prophecy of this book
[1:12:59] and i john saw these things and heard
[1:13:01] them
[1:13:02] and when i had heard and seen i fell
[1:13:04] down to worship before the feet of the
[1:13:07] angel which showed me
[1:13:09] these things
[1:13:12] okay
[1:13:15] then said he unto me see thou do it not
[1:13:17] for i am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:13:20] brethren the prophets and of them which
[1:13:22] keep the sayings of this book worship
[1:13:24] god
[1:13:28] and he says unto me seal not the sayings
[1:13:30] of the prophecy of this book
[1:13:32] for the time is at hand
[1:13:39] he that is unjust let him be unjust
[1:13:42] still
[1:13:44] and he which is filthy let him be filthy
[1:13:46] still and he that is righteous let him
[1:13:47] be righteous still and he says holy let
[1:13:49] him be holy still
[1:13:52] and behold i come quickly and my reward
[1:13:54] is with me to give every man according
[1:13:56] to his work
[1:13:57] shall he shall be i am alpha and omega
[1:14:01] the beginning and the end the first and
[1:14:03] the last
[1:14:07] now which one said that
[1:14:13] according to your red letter point
[1:14:17] the lord jesus
[1:14:20] was the main one speaking
[1:14:26] come on
[1:14:32] first in the life blessed are they
[1:14:35] that do his commandments that they may
[1:14:37] have a right to the tree of life and may
[1:14:38] enter in through the gates and to the
[1:14:40] city
[1:14:41] or without our dogs and sorcerers and
[1:14:43] mongers and murderers and adulterers and
[1:14:45] whosoever loveth to make a lie
[1:14:47] i jesus have sent
[1:14:49] mine angel
[1:14:51] to testify unto you these things in the
[1:14:54] churches
[1:14:55] i am the root and offspring of david
[1:14:58] and the bright and morning star
[1:15:01] i like that other one and the spirit and
[1:15:03] the bride say come amen
[1:15:07] now
[1:15:10] say what brother random said
[1:15:13] that that was a prophet
[1:15:16] maybe elijah
[1:15:18] or one of the prophets
[1:15:20] all right
[1:15:22] we go back to step one
[1:15:33] was it the person of brother branham
[1:15:36] that came to john on patmos
[1:15:41] or was it the prophet of god
[1:15:43] which came to john
[1:15:51] so you can't separate here
[1:15:54] in the readings
[1:15:57] the angel
[1:15:58] from the god who's fake
[1:16:04] try
[1:16:09] so it must be the prophet
[1:16:13] of the entire bible
[1:16:16] i believe that's who came to join on
[1:16:18] batman amen amen the prophet amen
[1:16:22] of the entire bible which would make all
[1:16:24] of the prophets
[1:16:26] standing
[1:16:28] in one finality
[1:16:33] to reveal
[1:16:36] because this man
[1:16:38] would be the one to reveal
[1:16:40] the next man that's coming number five
[1:16:43] he's going to israel
[1:16:46] he's going to take this message right
[1:16:49] the two prophets take this message to
[1:16:51] israel
[1:16:56] and they tell israel about who we are
[1:16:59] and what we've done
[1:17:03] see if we make it the prophet
[1:17:06] which is all the prophets together
[1:17:09] then we can see that the lord jesus
[1:17:12] christ is the prophet the form of god
[1:17:17] just as the
[1:17:18] logos was the form of god
[1:17:20] just as the son of god was the form of
[1:17:23] god
[1:17:26] now see i'm not a trinitarian but
[1:17:27] neither am i oneness
[1:17:33] i would to god one day i could ever get
[1:17:35] together enough to really preach
[1:17:38] what took place in rome in genesis
[1:17:42] because you see i don't have any trouble
[1:17:44] whatsoever seeing jesus christ standing
[1:17:47] on earth speaking to his father
[1:17:50] and not that he's talking to the one
[1:17:52] inside of him
[1:17:54] that's what everybody thinks
[1:17:58] my brother brown said you got the holy
[1:18:00] ghost in you
[1:18:01] said who do you talk to
[1:18:05] well i just whispered back inside of me
[1:18:06] i'm going to no no i pray to my father
[1:18:08] which is in heaven don't you
[1:18:11] jesus prayed to his father that was in
[1:18:13] heaven
[1:18:16] that form of god
[1:18:18] standing on earth
[1:18:21] was so much man
[1:18:23] that it could weep
[1:18:24] but it was so much god it could raise
[1:18:26] the dead
[1:18:31] that was god in another form
[1:18:33] called the son
[1:18:37] i believe the one that come to the
[1:18:39] general palace with all the prophets
[1:18:42] together in one prophet
[1:18:45] if you want to make that brother brown
[1:18:46] you're going to do what you want to
[1:18:53] i believe not that brother branham was
[1:18:55] to be introduced to the bride right
[1:18:57] that's it come on i just wrote down some
[1:18:59] things i believe
[1:19:00] i don't believe that brutal brandon came
[1:19:02] to introduce himself to the bride he
[1:19:05] came to introduce jesus christ to the
[1:19:07] bride
[1:19:10] right which is the word
[1:19:17] see we argue of who it was that came to
[1:19:20] john
[1:19:23] instead of thinking about what the man
[1:19:25] brought
[1:19:28] whoever it was
[1:19:30] whoever you think come to john batman
[1:19:33] it's not important who came it's
[1:19:35] important what he brought all right
[1:19:40] but remember there he only brought the
[1:19:42] writing of the word
[1:19:47] right come on so you better connected to
[1:19:49] the end time where this prophet could
[1:19:51] come and go in the word right and not
[1:19:54] just be who went to john but who went to
[1:19:57] all the prophets
[1:20:02] it would come out there with the
[1:20:03] revelation of jesus christ amen amen
[1:20:06] amen
[1:20:07] and introduce christ
[1:20:11] i don't believe we need to be concerned
[1:20:13] who came to brutal
[1:20:15] i believe listen i believe we need to be
[1:20:17] concerned
[1:20:19] of who came to brother branham
[1:20:22] and not of who brother branham came to
[1:20:30] but see the emphasis seems to be put on
[1:20:32] who came to john
[1:20:37] were you just in the writing of the book
[1:20:43] what about this
[1:20:50] who
[1:20:51] is the prophets
[1:20:54] it's the lord jesus christ
[1:20:58] i thought
[1:21:00] that's my nice doctor
[1:21:04] i thought the bible
[1:21:06] was a revelation of jesus christ right
[1:21:09] amen not the revelation
[1:21:12] of just one prophet
[1:21:14] right amen come on
[1:21:20] but the revelation of jesus christ amen
[1:21:22] right now may i state again so that
[1:21:24] maybe it'll collect on you
[1:21:28] elijah
[1:21:30] elisha
[1:21:32] john the baptist
[1:21:34] brother branham
[1:21:37] prophet going to israel the five times
[1:21:40] of the coming of elijah and neither one
[1:21:42] of them
[1:21:45] even if you're to ask elijah
[1:21:49] elijah are you the full total
[1:21:51] fulfillment of elijah he would have
[1:21:54] said i don't understand why i'm going to
[1:21:58] say this
[1:22:00] but i can't be all of it
[1:22:05] because that's what elijah said in
[1:22:08] john the baptist
[1:22:10] no i'm the voice of one crying in the
[1:22:12] building
[1:22:16] see it's not important who came to john
[1:22:19] it's important the message
[1:22:22] that is brought to you and i in this end
[1:22:24] time
[1:22:26] about this whole book right there
[1:22:32] did it that was brother brown amen
[1:22:37] but i still say he represented all the
[1:22:39] prophets amen
[1:22:42] anyhow you'd want to think about it
[1:22:46] i believe it was the lord jesus christ
[1:22:49] i believe revelation 22 when it turned
[1:22:51] to the red letter part that that's the
[1:22:53] one that come to john
[1:22:56] it was the lord jesus christ
[1:22:59] when you read revelation 22 it turned to
[1:23:01] the red letter showing that that was the
[1:23:03] lord jesus christ
[1:23:05] the lord jesus christ said i sent mine
[1:23:07] angel
[1:23:08] sure he did he sent us a church age
[1:23:10] messenger
[1:23:13] that was
[1:23:15] not only a church educator but a prophet
[1:23:18] anyway so that he could reveal the
[1:23:21] entire bible
[1:23:23] to this man
[1:23:26] that this man didn't have to take it to
[1:23:28] john
[1:23:30] that's no concern who took it to join
[1:23:33] it's the concern is what he took to join
[1:23:35] to be able to be brought to you and i to
[1:23:38] where god can reveal it right
[1:23:41] that's right and you take this prophet's
[1:23:42] message that's why that i say when i'm
[1:23:45] coming along reading a lot of
[1:23:46] time i just come down through there
[1:23:49] reading and you see all the right that's
[1:23:51] on there
[1:23:53] i don't write my bible what i do in mine
[1:23:55] because
[1:23:56] i write down what brother brown said
[1:24:00] i got it written right there in
[1:24:01] revelations
[1:24:03] one where he said this is not
[1:24:05] a prophet this is god
[1:24:10] it's because i want to know about who
[1:24:12] god is don't you
[1:24:19] thank god for all the prophets
[1:24:21] right
[1:24:23] thank god for the revelation amen amen
[1:24:26] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:24:29] john is not the author of the book of
[1:24:31] revelation
[1:24:33] right john is described right
[1:24:39] a lie uh let's see isaiah let me put
[1:24:41] this way my own words okay isaiah was
[1:24:44] not the author of the book of isaiah
[1:24:46] right
[1:24:48] he was described
[1:24:50] to write
[1:24:52] what the real author was telling him
[1:24:56] that's why david could stand forth and
[1:24:58] say
[1:25:00] they pierced my hands and my feet
[1:25:05] he could say the lord said unto my lord
[1:25:07] sit down on my right hand like that
[1:25:09] enemies my footstool
[1:25:14] the ethiopian unit was not the one
[1:25:15] that's either known as
[1:25:18] went down that philip i reckon we're
[1:25:19] talking to
[1:25:20] and
[1:25:22] he said is this man
[1:25:23] talking about himself or another
[1:25:27] because he could read there that it
[1:25:29] sound just like the man was talking
[1:25:30] about himself those prophets were so
[1:25:33] engulfed
[1:25:34] until david was probably even in his
[1:25:37] mentality
[1:25:39] feeling the beatings
[1:25:41] that the lord jesus was receiving
[1:25:44] because he by spirit entered their end
[1:25:50] see i don't have any problems with
[1:25:51] anybody i'm just what i say
[1:25:53] because it's what i believe
[1:25:56] my emphasis is upon
[1:25:58] what was brought
[1:26:02] to you and i
[1:26:04] by the prophet of this nice day
[1:26:07] if you give any more emphasis and they
[1:26:09] don't like to know it let's say
[1:26:13] it's not what i've got to say or what
[1:26:15] you've got to say
[1:26:17] and listen
[1:26:18] the prophet brought what god had to say
[1:26:21] but here's the main thing
[1:26:23] the bible said he didn't hear what the
[1:26:25] spirit had to say
[1:26:27] that was to each church age
[1:26:30] the main emphasis is where the holy
[1:26:32] spirit in you that we were talking about
[1:26:33] the evidence the other day
[1:26:34] of whether or not it can keep on
[1:26:36] agreeing with the work
[1:26:39] think on these things what do we have
[1:26:40] 120 in the red book
[1:26:43] anybody have a
[1:26:49] the need savior
[1:27:08] every
[1:27:16] will give day
[1:27:35] um
[1:28:06] bring your face
[1:28:16] is
[1:28:41] church
[1:28:46] maybe some of you were thinking of this
[1:28:49] brother they'll be careful
[1:28:51] what you say about the prophet
[1:28:56] i wrestle that out today
[1:29:00] because satan when i started studying
[1:29:02] for this he says
[1:29:04] you're going to get in trouble
[1:29:08] because you're gonna have to go against
[1:29:10] some of the things seemingly the prophet
[1:29:12] was teaching
[1:29:17] i said okay
[1:29:21] no problem
[1:29:23] because my heart's clear
[1:29:26] i brought what i thought what i believe
[1:29:30] and that way my heart is clear
[1:29:34] i don't have to worry then
[1:29:37] so don't think you say when i be careful
[1:29:40] i always try to be real careful
[1:29:42] the way i work things
[1:29:44] the way i say it
[1:29:47] because that way it's not that i try to
[1:29:49] compromise
[1:29:50] he says i try to tell the truth right
[1:29:54] if you believe that was brother brown
[1:29:56] that come to john on batman's anybody
[1:29:57] out there listening are you here
[1:29:59] that's your business
[1:30:03] all i still want to know is
[1:30:05] what brother branham brought to you and
[1:30:07] i
[1:30:09] wherever it come from or whoever got it
[1:30:12] that's all i want to know
[1:30:16] but i do know that that was only the
[1:30:17] writing of the book
[1:30:20] just everybody's emphasis upon
[1:30:24] that john
[1:30:25] if you say brother around come to john
[1:30:27] well then he was coming to john to tell
[1:30:28] him what to write
[1:30:31] he wouldn't come in to tell him what it
[1:30:32] was to reveal it
[1:30:35] that would be in this day
[1:30:37] amen
[1:30:40] see think on these things it's very
[1:30:42] serious in this hour that we're living
[1:30:46] but that's the way i think about every
[1:30:47] message
[1:30:49] every message i've ever preached i try
[1:30:50] to preach it with honesty and sincerity
[1:30:52] of my heart
[1:30:56] to believe and try to show you every
[1:30:58] side of it different ways whatever what
[1:31:00] people think but then conclude we're
[1:31:03] telling you what i believe
[1:31:07] see if there's any problems with heaven
[1:31:09] and
[1:31:11] the lord knows my heart's right
[1:31:14] so think about it
[1:31:16] stumbling on them
[1:31:37] come to me
[1:31:47] ready
[1:32:04] oh
[1:32:29] right
[1:32:51] m
[1:33:06] good musicians
[1:33:26] so
[1:33:37] um
[1:33:51] is
[1:34:06] uh
