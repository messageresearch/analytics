[10:24] people Lord having a human experience
[10:28] we've come to this earth Lord
[10:30] the Holy Ghost that's in Silas was
[10:32] before the foundation of the world
[10:34] it's a part of you uh we're going to
[10:37] read Lord we're we're the prophet of God
[10:40] says we are your righteousness because
[10:43] ours is filthy rags and Lord I pray that
[10:46] you be with us today we were the ones
[10:48] that are sick bless the ones that are on
[10:50] highways bless the ones that are that
[10:52] are doing the work in a foreign country

[11:13] report father we pray that you would
[11:15] just take care of us now be with us in
[11:17] this service you give Revelation because
[11:20] we can't father just use us by your
[11:24] grace
[11:24] Jesus name we pray
[11:26] amen this would be part 85 when the son
[11:29] of man in the beginning was the word
[11:30] words with God and the Word was God and
[11:32] what the word was made flesh and dwelt
[11:34] among us we behold his glory the glory
[11:36] the only begotten of the father
[11:38] full of grace and truth you can go ahead
[11:39] and sit down also remember Sister Monica
[11:41] and the kids and and them are over in
[11:44] Beaufort
[11:46] I think they had a shower or something
[11:48] for for Esther you know she's getting
[11:50] married in March so remember that to
[11:53] RSVP to that if you're going to go all
[11:55] right it's about four hours from here
[11:57] and it will be on the 25th of March I
[12:00] left my thing in the back but I'm pretty
[12:02] sure that's what it is so that's where
[12:04] sister Monica and them are today so
[12:05] let's just remember them in prayer
[12:07] Genesis 2 9 now we're going to talk
[12:10] today about knowledge and knowledge has
[12:13] two parts to it there's human natural
[12:16] knowledge
[12:17] and then there's a knowledge that came
[12:19] off the tree of knowledge of Good and
[12:21] Evil get by with me all right there's
[12:24] two trees one is the Tree of Life
[12:27] God said if you'll eat from that tree
[12:29] you'll never die but the first bite you
[12:32] take off of this tree you're gonna die
[12:34] all right so that's one remember what
[12:37] happened we know what happened in the
[12:38] Garden of Eden we don't have to discuss
[12:39] that we're all Home Folks today
[12:41] we don't have to discuss what went on in
[12:44] the garden all right so we know that it
[12:45] was the fall of Man the fall of mankind
[12:48] and as soon as that happened man became
[12:52] became began to have to take a sacrifice
[12:55] Abel Cain there's many people in the
[12:58] message of preachers that that that I
[13:00] know that sadly think that Abel was so
[13:03] righteous he didn't need a sacrifice
[13:05] well you're gonna have to change the
[13:06] Bible
[13:07] you're gonna have to change your
[13:08] prophet's message he was born in sin he
[13:11] was born by an act that should have
[13:13] never been the same way as Cain Cain was
[13:15] born by an actor should have never been
[13:16] so they both needed a sacrifice they
[13:18] both were lost just Abel got a
[13:21] revelation and we're going to read here
[13:22] in just a few minutes to put brother
[13:23] around say about Revelation
[13:24] there's nothing more powerful than a
[13:27] revelation and I'll read it to you in
[13:29] just a little while because we're
[13:30] talking about knowledge today that's
[13:32] where Revelation comes it comes from a
[13:34] knowledge of what the truth
[13:36] but now you can keep a knowledge of the
[13:38] truth and die and go to hell
[13:41] those who have come to the knowledge of
[13:42] the truth remember we're going to read
[13:44] that in just a little bit
[13:45] so Isaiah 28 9 says Whom Shall he teach
[13:48] knowledge me
[13:50] me
[13:53] and Whom Shall he make to earns to stand
[13:55] Doctrine me
[13:57] them that are weaned from the milk and
[13:59] drawn
[14:00] from the brass in other words growth
[14:02] development that's what we're talking
[14:03] about we're in talking about adoption
[14:04] and and placing of sons God I was
[14:08] listening to a minister last night and
[14:09] he did a real good job you know brother
[14:11] Brown said this bride been Brides brides
[14:13] churches Brides churches he continues
[14:15] all the way down he said but they'll
[14:16] come one
[14:18] see listen we're a bride out of a bride
[14:21] we're a bride out of a church we're a
[14:23] church out of a church
[14:24] everybody with me because we're the
[14:26] bride but there's been Brides down
[14:28] Through the Ages there's been Brides
[14:29] there's been Brides in every Church age
[14:31] but he said they would come one
[14:34] there'll be a group of people that'll be
[14:36] the Bride of laodicea but there'll be a
[14:39] group that will be called out of that to
[14:40] a body change so there'll be a group of
[14:42] people inside of a group of people and
[14:45] that's us
[14:46] there's no more Church ages back that
[14:48] way I'm sure we're living in laodicea
[14:50] but we're not of laodicea we have listen
[14:53] if you got laid out to see your ideas
[14:55] you're lost
[14:59] well truth anyhow
[15:03] and then what Isaiah 53 where are we
[15:05] going to find this knowledge we're going
[15:06] to find it in Jesus Christ it's not our
[15:09] righteous this is not our knowledge I'll
[15:10] read it to you in a few minutes we're a
[15:12] very familiar scripture he says your
[15:14] ways are not my ways your thoughts are
[15:16] not my cause my thoughts are higher than
[15:18] your thoughts so if you think your
[15:19] thoughts were something you better match
[15:21] it to that one
[15:22] and if it's contrary to that one it's
[15:24] come from somebody else it comes from
[15:26] that other guy
[15:28] by his knowledge
[15:30] shall my righteous servant justify many
[15:32] who me let's make this personal today
[15:34] for he shall bear their iniquity
[15:38] he bore our iniquity he took our shame
[15:41] he washed us and cleaned us up listen if
[15:44] he picked that jar up praise God if God
[15:48] picks you up out of the world then he's
[15:51] got something to do with you he didn't
[15:53] pick you up and say I don't think I want
[15:55] to use that but I'll use another one
[15:56] listen God doesn't ever make a mistake
[15:58] he never makes a wrong move if he
[16:01] reaches
[16:03] sister Regina if he reaches
[16:05] he's going to do something with it you
[16:07] and I may reach for something not don't
[16:09] want to use that
[16:10] but he doesn't reach for something and
[16:12] not use it
[16:13] but remember
[16:15] he said there's vessels of what honor
[16:18] and there's vessels of Dishonor all
[16:21] right and that's made up with you you
[16:23] understand which one that is because you
[16:25] know what you can you can let God pick
[16:27] you up in justification you can let him
[16:29] clean you up in sanctification
[16:31] but you can say no I don't want you to
[16:33] use me fully
[16:35] you can say that yourself and stop and
[16:38] be the the quote where brother Brown
[16:40] says you can have the baptism of the
[16:41] Holy Ghost on your spirit which is that
[16:43] sanctification part and die and go to
[16:46] hell
[16:47] you got to have the inside God the
[16:48] unclean Spirit has got to go out the
[16:50] inside guy and then we were talking
[16:53] um
[16:54] now today go and pull the chart up if
[16:56] you don't mind please
[16:58] we were talking the other day
[17:01] we know now that the unclean Spirit if
[17:03] you're born again today
[17:05] if you're born again baptized with the
[17:07] Holy Ghost the fire of God has cleaned
[17:10] your soul out you're perfect
[17:14] if
[17:15] he cleaned you out
[17:18] you're perfect your bride
[17:21] but he doesn't want to just put the baby
[17:23] in the closet
[17:25] Brother Anderson if they can't find it
[17:26] that's okay but if I can I appreciate
[17:28] you pulling it up
[17:31] we don't need to stay babies
[17:34] we need to eat we need to be a
[17:36] functional group of Believers not just
[17:39] well I'm in the message I don't cut my
[17:41] hair don't do this or do this I don't do
[17:42] that or do this don't do that you can be
[17:44] lost
[17:46] as
[17:49] Judas
[17:52] Judas had a Ministry cast out Devils
[17:55] went to church
[17:57] he was the treasurer of the church
[17:59] brother Brown said held the money back
[18:02] and he fooled everybody but one man
[18:05] he didn't fool the son of man he fooled
[18:08] every one of them but one guy and that's
[18:09] why we've come to a place where we we're
[18:11] going to start talking about the son of
[18:12] man a little bit later because the son
[18:14] of man never was fooled that's right
[18:17] never never was he fool never did he not
[18:20] have an answer and everyone never what
[18:21] did he back up from a challenge
[18:24] amen but some of us see that's what I
[18:27] mean about babies when we become babies
[18:29] we back up from a challenge sometimes
[18:32] because we don't know how to handle it
[18:34] we don't have enough knowledge
[18:36] we don't have enough virtue that's why I
[18:38] said there's going to be Christians that
[18:40] that praise God they're Christians
[18:42] but don't even go live in the city
[18:46] I said Christians I say bride bride
[18:48] lives in the city
[18:50] there's gonna be a lot of Christians a
[18:52] lot of people save because there's a
[18:54] group of people that believes John 3 16.
[18:57] they'll come to a Sanctified condition
[18:59] and that's as far as they can go that's
[19:00] as far as their teachers can teach them
[19:02] that's as far as their denomination to
[19:04] let them go but if they live the true
[19:05] word of God they will be saved
[19:08] but not full of the Holy Ghost
[19:13] read anointing ones at the end time
[19:15] folks
[19:16] like somebody said one time I read that
[19:18] first thing and it scared me to death it
[19:20] ought to scare you to death
[19:21] and I'll scare you to death that we've
[19:22] been sitting here in the message Church
[19:23] 50 or 60 years and ain't got enough
[19:25] discernment for stuff don't have enough
[19:27] discernment or no right from wrong
[19:29] um and you know I mean as we get closer
[19:32] to the headstone it should be easier for
[19:36] us to believe the word of God act on the
[19:39] word of God and become the word of God
[19:41] should be easier it's easier for you to
[19:43] be a functional human being a baby
[19:45] it's not a functional human being
[19:48] can they take yourself to the store
[19:51] can they can they drive a car
[19:53] can they make decisions about their life
[19:55] no
[19:58] what do they need they need an adult
[20:00] they need a five-fold Ministry to teach
[20:02] them how to get to there then if they
[20:04] become a baby and stay a baby it's your
[20:07] fault
[20:08] if you sit on the ministry though that
[20:10] teaches you the right thing like we have
[20:12] had for 50 years
[20:14] then there's no excuse for you to stay a
[20:17] baby good to be a baby we've got some of
[20:20] you that's told me that you've got
[20:21] you've got the holy ghost in the last
[20:23] year that's great you're a baby Christ
[20:25] but remember there isn't there is a oh
[20:28] it's just the door's wide open you don't
[20:30] have to say well do I need to go over
[20:32] here do I need to go over here is that
[20:33] right is this right no this is true
[20:36] and see that comes from your soul that's
[20:38] the faith or doubt that's all we got
[20:40] today
[20:41] then in the spirit realm is what we're
[20:43] working on these virtues because the
[20:45] spirit is what imagination conscious
[20:48] memory reason affection see that's where
[20:50] Satan got to Eve in that Spirit Realm
[20:55] because in her soul she was
[20:58] eternal
[21:01] God purpose that for a reason
[21:04] because Adam was eternal
[21:06] he put eternal life in Adam
[21:08] he put eternal life in Eve because she
[21:10] was a part of him
[21:12] listen the Reason God put eternal life
[21:14] in Jesus Christ is because he put it in
[21:16] you
[21:17] is he not the first Adam are we not the
[21:20] second Eve we're not going to fall like
[21:22] that first Steve did though but some has
[21:25] denominations back in the ages they fell
[21:27] that's why Christ had to put them away
[21:30] that's why I had Brides brides churches
[21:33] Brides churches listen he put her away
[21:35] and gave her a writing of divorcement
[21:37] that's why it's so important to
[21:39] understand marriage and divorce so much
[21:41] in the spiritual realm as you do in the
[21:43] natural realm you got to understand that
[21:45] we are
[21:46] and can
[21:48] be prostitutes to this word
[21:51] we can take on a new doctrine Hey listen
[21:54] I'm so glad a prophet came in the end
[21:56] time aren't y'all glad it Prophet came
[21:57] in in town
[21:59] because he stood there one day and he
[22:00] told us he said he said I was Discerning
[22:03] that's what we're going to get to I was
[22:04] Discerning this brother remember tells
[22:06] the story and he said I went to talk to
[22:08] that brother about what run around on
[22:11] his wife
[22:13] right
[22:15] he thought this brother was running
[22:16] around on his wife because he had an
[22:18] adultered Spirit on him am I with me
[22:21] what was his problem he was not an
[22:23] adulterer he was fooling with a
[22:26] denominational church now come on
[22:28] somebody that's that ought to tell you
[22:30] one thing's for sure
[22:32] be careful what you got stuck in your
[22:34] head
[22:36] oh that's out there no it's in here
[22:39] we have a denominational idea of sitting
[22:41] right here because if it's your own idea
[22:44] it's a denominational idea
[22:46] amen
[22:49] so now we're working then in the spirit
[22:51] realm and that's where Satan he can he
[22:54] can forget about the body the body only
[22:57] moves as I'm telling my hands to move
[22:59] if I tell them to stop they stop they
[23:02] just don't continue doing this
[23:03] right so don't worry about your body you
[23:06] might listen our body's falling apart
[23:08] there's nothing we can do about that at
[23:09] the moment
[23:10] oh yours okay brother Kylie I know he's
[23:13] smiling so am I
[23:20] my knee that never my knees never hurt
[23:24] I turn one way and
[23:27] found out I haven't
[23:29] a left knee that was hurting
[23:31] it was because I was outside playing
[23:33] football with somebody or just cause I
[23:34] was walking
[23:37] come on now
[23:39] but we have to take care of this body we
[23:41] understand that but but
[23:49] going out the other side he said you
[23:52] worry about what goes in the heart
[23:54] because out of the heart I'm speaking to
[23:57] you today I hope you believe that I hope
[24:00] you believe that out of the heart a holy
[24:01] ghost-filled person can teach you
[24:03] something not this world listen all
[24:07] those with my cicado uh James Thompson
[24:10] all them different ones they have their
[24:12] points they have their times but I
[24:14] listen to the prophet of God I know
[24:17] that's right
[24:18] I don't know what cause listen when they
[24:20] teach what they teach what's their idea
[24:22] God's three
[24:25] hell's eternal
[24:28] hello somebody you never thought about
[24:30] that have you when they speak their
[24:33] knowledge their discernment of the Bible
[24:35] is wrong
[24:38] amen because they're trinitarians that's
[24:40] why God had to send us a prophet to
[24:43] straighten all that out and praise God
[24:45] you've ever I read this the other day
[24:47] and read it different now
[24:49] behold I send you Elijah the prophet now
[24:52] remember we always say you
[24:54] he didn't say he didn't say I turned the
[24:56] head
[24:58] he said I turn your heart
[25:01] he went right down into the soul of man
[25:03] and to prove it he discerned the
[25:05] thoughts and intents of their heart
[25:07] what's discernment going on that was
[25:09] down in the soul part
[25:11] that wasn't in their Spirit he went way
[25:13] down in that throne room he said I can
[25:15] feel that you're a Christian or he says
[25:18] You're Not Safe son you need to get
[25:20] saved and God will heal you from that
[25:22] smoking or heal you from whatever that
[25:24] is and he even does
[25:26] old mama would stand there she'd be
[25:29] crying and he said I see you got a son
[25:31] that's lost
[25:33] now that went from her mind sure she was
[25:35] thinking about that was the filter that
[25:37] he came through but it was down in her
[25:39] soul
[25:40] that's my kids
[25:42] when Hattie Rock said that ain't nothing
[25:44] but the truth that came from her soul
[25:45] that did not come from her affection
[25:47] yeah you saw it was no it came from what
[25:50] it came from agape love that was inside
[25:52] the lady to speak
[25:55] and her kids were saved we ought to try
[25:58] that sometime
[25:59] but the unclean unclean spirits going
[26:01] out it's out of our soul now that's why
[26:04] that's okay we're good we're ready but
[26:07] the spirit realm is where the Bible is
[26:09] it's where the fight is you see those
[26:11] two swords up there that's where the
[26:12] fight is it's in the spirit realm it's
[26:15] in a place of discernment look
[26:16] discernment it's the kitchen it's where
[26:18] you eat it's where you get fed it's
[26:21] where you let out what's inside
[26:26] you ever heard that before
[26:30] but that's what we're working on now
[26:32] those of you that are born again
[26:34] we are working on the spirit Realm
[26:37] the one you live in 99 of your time
[26:40] because according to the Bible that your
[26:43] soul is now sitting in Heavenly places
[26:46] tomorrow's Monday right
[26:49] that's not a Heavenly place
[26:51] I'm sorry for those of you that need to
[26:53] work
[26:54] those you don't work don't worry about
[26:55] it we're going to work so we pay your
[26:56] salary okay
[26:58] keeping all afloat
[27:00] that's what I tell them men at the store
[27:02] they said where you going I said I'm
[27:03] going to work so you don't have to
[27:06] like I said keep going
[27:07] pay taxes
[27:09] but their Spirit realm affection reason
[27:11] memory conscious imagination that all
[27:14] listen when you were born you had those
[27:16] qualities because you're a human
[27:19] right but that affection was what the
[27:21] Bible says set your affections on things
[27:24] above so our affection was set where on
[27:27] things below
[27:29] our affection was we loved the world and
[27:31] the things of the world
[27:33] we reasoned away I'm not going to church
[27:36] I might get something
[27:38] amen
[27:40] listen if you have some of y'all are
[27:42] sick on on Sunday don't worry once you
[27:45] get up Monday you'll be healed
[27:51] maybe we need we don't need prayer line
[27:53] on Monday you just automatically get
[27:54] healed you go right on to work and
[27:56] everything's fine Sunday is oh okay
[28:00] we can't hardly make it
[28:02] I'll be working tomorrow though
[28:05] our memory our conscious
[28:08] in our imagination
[28:10] how many times have you seen heard
[28:12] people say I imagine
[28:14] that's you
[28:16] God don't imagine nothing he don't sit
[28:18] and imagine something and and what about
[28:20] a brain though but think about what
[28:22] we're going to have
[28:23] if we have the mind of Christ it's
[28:25] supposed to be heading toward that
[28:26] direction to where our thoughts are his
[28:29] thoughts our ways are his ways
[28:32] that's why Paul said we need the mind of
[28:34] Christ in the Old Testament he said your
[28:36] ways are not my ways
[28:38] but I'm coming to show you the way
[28:40] to think like I do you say we can't do
[28:43] that yes you can
[28:46] no I'm sorry you can't
[28:49] but yes you can through him
[28:51] if you get him in that control tower
[28:54] but what was all these virtues it was to
[28:57] obey what God Said is What brought the
[28:59] power so if we don't have power in our
[29:01] life we're not doing everything God told
[29:03] us to do
[29:07] okay that's what brought the powers what
[29:10] brought the virtue is obedience to the
[29:12] word of God and remember obedience is
[29:15] better than sacrifice sometimes the word
[29:17] of God is sharp it's cutting we have
[29:20] emotions we have feelings we have all
[29:22] these things
[29:23] that's human
[29:26] the human
[29:28] but what does the word of God say
[29:31] that's the that's the top line that
[29:33] ain't the bottom line that's the Top
[29:34] Line what does the word of God say
[29:38] well I don't think I ought to have to go
[29:40] to church
[29:41] what's the word of God say
[29:44] just go back to the word of God
[29:51] I'd hate to have to know
[29:53] I couldn't go to church
[29:55] have you ever had that attitude tell me
[29:57] you already get that attitude
[29:59] that you what programs they can't wait
[30:01] for the doors get up that's exactly what
[30:02] I'm talking about
[30:04] my desire is to go to church
[30:08] now if I got the same Spirit you do you
[30:11] ought to have the same desire
[30:16] now when it's great Elijah comes what
[30:18] he'll be taking the message of Pentecost
[30:20] to turn the children to the face of the
[30:22] father's work in their heart
[30:24] van work on the outside guy or the
[30:27] middle guy they didn't look because they
[30:29] didn't keep the same faith that was back
[30:31] there at the beginning we read Abraham's
[30:33] Covenant but watch John appears he turns
[30:35] the hearts like I said before we'll skip
[30:38] through that I just said told you that
[30:39] that's what Elijah is to do come and
[30:42] change your heart not your head not give
[30:44] you head knowledge and I listen I've
[30:46] heard people in the message and I can't
[30:48] stand this one thing I can't stand is I
[30:50] know more than you do
[30:53] I know more than you do so I don't have
[30:55] to listen to you I know more than you do
[30:57] brother Brown sat down one time in
[30:59] lesson two
[31:00] who was it
[31:03] he listened to uh what was the president
[31:06] before Ford
[31:08] Nixon he sat down and listened to Nixon
[31:10] when he was in Washington before they
[31:11] had that video he sat down and listened
[31:14] no not to a sermon but he listened to a
[31:16] speech because in turn that that
[31:18] president came to want to Warner
[31:20] Brothers meet of course he wasn't
[31:21] president then he was like a senator or
[31:23] something
[31:25] brother Brown never said I'm not going
[31:27] down there to listen to that guy because
[31:28] I know more than he does now that's a
[31:30] totally horrible attitude to have all
[31:33] right
[31:34] I know some of us we did the same thing
[31:36] we have our favorite preachers and we
[31:37] have our ones that we don't want around
[31:39] anymore listen if they've got the
[31:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost surely they
[31:42] say sorry one thing
[31:44] that'll help you
[31:48] I'll clap for that one
[31:50] [Applause]
[31:52] I will restore to you
[31:55] the years that the locusts eat look what
[31:58] we have in the end time we have the
[32:01] ability for that bride tree to be
[32:04] restored to its fullness so it can grow
[32:06] fruit out at the end so it can have
[32:08] leaves so it can have Fellowship
[32:11] and have Fellowship not because
[32:13] everybody likes your ship
[32:17] now praise the Lord anyhow
[32:21] and you shall eat
[32:22] him praise the name of the Lord your God
[32:24] that hath dealt wondrously with you
[32:27] and my people shall never be ashamed I
[32:30] am not ashamed of this Bible I'm not
[32:32] ashamed of this message of the hour I'm
[32:34] not ashamed of this gospel I'm not
[32:36] ashamed God sent a prophet I'm not
[32:38] ashamed to go to little church
[32:42] because I want to come to that right
[32:44] there I want to come to die I want you
[32:45] to come more than I do me
[32:48] because maybe God will put somebody
[32:49] that'll help me
[32:52] tell me y'all with your wings on you
[32:54] help me please
[32:58] the position of a believer
[33:01] now this is adoption real quick
[33:04] does everybody understand adoption or do
[33:06] I need to go over it
[33:07] anybody not
[33:11] okay now then I'll let you know then so
[33:14] what happens don't think Hey listen
[33:16] we're not leaving anybody
[33:19] we're brain taking everybody with us hey
[33:21] man we're going everybody's going we're
[33:23] not leaving somebody
[33:25] so listen adoption is not when you say
[33:28] that in your head as an American you
[33:31] think of that you can't have a child or
[33:34] you you see somebody in foster care and
[33:36] you want to adopt them into your family
[33:38] that's not what that means
[33:41] because listen God does not adopt
[33:43] Satan's kids
[33:46] he adopts his kids he already has if
[33:49] you'll grow to that you've all got the
[33:52] potential but look as soon as the boy is
[33:53] born in other words as soon as you're
[33:55] born again you're a child of God
[33:58] and you get all the potential
[34:00] everything God has in the Bible
[34:03] everything God has in the message of the
[34:05] hour you get that power inside of you
[34:08] amen
[34:10] well as soon as he the boy was born he
[34:12] was the son of that family he was born
[34:15] into that family but he was not adopted
[34:18] he was not somewhere to where he looked
[34:21] the the father looks over and says here
[34:23] run my Factory
[34:28] takes the keys and throws them out of
[34:30] the yard
[34:31] or takes him and sticks him in his mouth
[34:33] you see that's the baby but you don't
[34:35] say well that's not my kid anymore no
[34:38] once a son you're a son
[34:40] once you're born again God can't take
[34:42] that back he won't take it back he has a
[34:44] purpose for you somewhere down the line
[34:47] the father loved him of course
[34:49] then we talk about Galatians we've been
[34:51] over this before a little bit we're
[34:52] going to continue to go over it again so
[34:54] what happened when the Full Gospel
[34:55] Church began way under years ago they
[34:58] became sons of God listen if like I said
[35:00] before the bride has been in every
[35:02] Church age that's sons of God
[35:05] but they have not come to full adoption
[35:07] because full adoption is every word of
[35:10] God correct every word of God that
[35:13] precedeth out of the mouth of God not
[35:15] every word of God trinitarian every word
[35:18] of God eternal hell have a word of God
[35:20] baptized father son that's not the word
[35:22] of God
[35:23] am I with me on this that's not the word
[35:26] of God
[35:27] that's why God had to send us a prophet
[35:29] so there's no there's no excuse if you
[35:31] sit here
[35:32] and listen to whoever it is
[35:36] the holy spirit's your tutor
[35:39] the things you used to do you don't do
[35:41] anymore why because if you do the same
[35:42] thing you did before
[35:46] where's the spirit of the one that did
[35:48] it
[35:49] now we know that it moves out into the
[35:53] second round
[35:55] everybody with me then that's when we
[35:56] have problems too
[35:58] right
[35:59] that's when that's when the devil can
[36:01] can punch back
[36:04] listen the devil didn't punch me when I
[36:06] was in the world
[36:08] I wanted his he'd Pat me on the back
[36:10] said go buddy go buddy well guess what
[36:14] when I got born again God said go buddy
[36:18] I got on the right team
[36:20] and the Holy Spirit is the tutor to
[36:22] raise them in admonition of God not to
[36:24] raise you
[36:25] emotionally
[36:28] but spiritually
[36:32] that's why look they hated they hated
[36:35] Jesus Christ
[36:37] they hated him enough to kill him
[36:40] you're Beelzebub
[36:42] we don't even like you to be in this
[36:44] Temple
[36:46] come on somebody that was the son of man
[36:48] that was what you and I are supposed to
[36:50] be right now today
[36:52] the world eventually I promise you the
[36:54] world will hate you as much as they hate
[36:56] Jesus Christ
[36:57] if you become Jesus Christ if you stay
[37:02] with half the world and halfway look
[37:03] they don't care
[37:08] they don't care anymore it really
[37:10] doesn't matter you do whatever you want
[37:12] to
[37:12] and you're going to heaven
[37:15] my Bible says let's go back to the Bible
[37:17] my Bible says Hell hath enlarged its
[37:20] Gates
[37:22] hell happened for what
[37:25] cause hell wasn't made for humans it was
[37:28] made for the devil and his angels that's
[37:30] why the prophet of God said you crawl
[37:32] over the cross to get to hell
[37:37] and there's going to be a lot of good
[37:38] religious people in hell I'm sorry
[37:43] now so Tudor's been watching
[37:45] down Through the Ages he's watching
[37:48] and listen
[37:49] God knows your heart
[37:52] look at look at David
[37:55] I mean about any yellow murder
[37:58] I didn't mean to say that yeah
[38:01] turn the cameras off
[38:04] ain't y'all been a liar
[38:07] it more more than twice okay alter
[38:14] David was a liar
[38:17] it was an adulterer
[38:19] he didn't just murder his best friend he
[38:21] premeditated to murder his best friend
[38:23] to take his wife because he'd done what
[38:25] he did but God said
[38:28] he's a man after my own heart
[38:31] you know what he said and he said
[38:35] he said this guy
[38:39] there's the son of David why he looked
[38:43] at David's heart
[38:45] we've had the same you say well I've
[38:47] never killed anybody brother rapson you
[38:49] kill him with your influence
[38:55] we try to look at all the physical
[38:56] things a lot of times they're spiritual
[38:58] that's why we want to work in that
[39:00] Spirit realm more than we've ever worked
[39:03] before
[39:04] is have I have I offended my brother
[39:06] have I offended my sister am I doing the
[39:09] right thing am I doing the wrong thing
[39:12] listen God that's why God give us a
[39:14] five-fold Ministry
[39:15] to break these things down and and I
[39:17] appreciate these brothers that's been
[39:19] here that that break it down and the
[39:21] ones that are here today uh well one of
[39:23] them but the other the other two is
[39:25] overseas they couldn't get here this
[39:26] morning
[39:29] they have an excuse
[39:32] but look they've seen the age of birth
[39:35] you say born again that's right correct
[39:38] you're just as much a son as you ever
[39:40] will be when you're born again
[39:43] but
[39:45] but
[39:46] what brother Branham but the Tudor
[39:48] bringing word to the father
[39:51] then if the Father the tutor comes to
[39:53] the father and a boy becomes about age
[39:55] about where the church ought to be now
[39:58] age in other words able to drive able to
[40:01] write his check able to run the company
[40:05] when he comes of age brightened up
[40:07] praise God we all need that
[40:09] seasoned
[40:11] according to Time when the boy become of
[40:13] age the tutor come to the father who's
[40:16] the tutor the Holy Ghost now listen
[40:17] there's not three
[40:20] there's not a there's not a person down
[40:22] here that goes to a person up here and
[40:24] Holy Ghost is just God in another form
[40:26] and he's in the form where he's watching
[40:28] you
[40:30] to see what you'll do
[40:35] and see the boy being a son already but
[40:38] yet if he wasn't a worthy son the father
[40:40] could not adopt him or place him in his
[40:42] own family
[40:43] so remember it's not like the it's not
[40:46] like adoption like we think about
[40:47] adoption
[40:49] you adopting what you're doing is
[40:51] let me tell you what this is this is
[40:53] adopting what's in the father into the
[40:56] sun
[40:57] his father his own blood his own
[40:59] genetics his own person
[41:01] amen isn't that what the new birth is
[41:04] putting God in us
[41:07] all right so he puts God in us and then
[41:09] what we're supposed to act like
[41:13] that would be God
[41:16] if he wasn't a worthy son the father
[41:18] couldn't adopt him or place him in his
[41:20] own family look he couldn't do it
[41:21] because the boy would run through what
[41:23] he had
[41:24] he was a Restless child he didn't have
[41:26] the ability to carry on with his
[41:27] father's work look so the father didn't
[41:29] throw him out the father didn't throw
[41:31] the particles on out the prodigal son
[41:33] left
[41:34] so the father just let him go on as a
[41:37] son
[41:38] he was already a son but if he was a
[41:41] fine boy
[41:42] he was about his father's business and
[41:44] the tutor brought word to the father
[41:45] saying that the son is fine he's
[41:48] eligible
[41:49] he's all right then the father took the
[41:51] son out in a public place as a public
[41:54] testimony and he put a special robe on
[41:56] him and set him up before the people and
[41:58] father by doing this give the son of the
[42:01] son the authority over his kingdom over
[42:04] his business that's why God gives us
[42:06] power and authority we just gotta get it
[42:09] and listen then we got to know how to
[42:11] use it
[42:12] that's why power without character is
[42:15] what satanic
[42:17] the son had a right to go out and do
[42:19] certain things in the Kingdom listen we
[42:21] have a right to do things we have a
[42:23] right to pray for the sick we have a
[42:25] right to testify we have a right to
[42:27] baptize people
[42:29] doesn't take just a preacher can we find
[42:31] brother Dale or me or whoever
[42:33] no
[42:36] do it yourself
[42:41] here we set they're not we set but here
[42:44] shall a crowd of people
[42:45] the greatest healing campaign that ever
[42:47] been since the since Jesus Christ was
[42:49] here was William brownham right he was
[42:52] getting ready to call a prayer line and
[42:54] and I'm just saying all right this is us
[42:56] not adopting
[42:57] got to come up here and let me pray for
[42:59] you
[43:00] I'm this I'm Prophet you gotta come
[43:03] listen to me
[43:04] you got to come up here and let me pray
[43:06] for you I'm the one that did it all
[43:09] right and I'm gonna lay my hands on you
[43:11] no look girl come to the little lady
[43:14] comes to a prayer line with a baby
[43:16] he said oh sister I see you so and so on
[43:18] so and so he said oh he said your baby's
[43:20] healed see that sister's sitting right
[43:22] there
[43:23] was a mama she laid her hands on you and
[43:26] prayed and entered into that with you
[43:28] and you're healed
[43:30] he said give God praise
[43:33] he curse it all now women I still need
[43:35] to pray for you because I'm I'm a
[43:36] so-and-so no
[43:38] God would have never used William Brown
[43:40] if he had been that way he was the most
[43:42] humble man that ever was
[43:44] amen and he gave all the glory to God
[43:46] and please let us be that way to
[43:48] everything we have we give the glory to
[43:50] God not the glory to some man all right
[43:53] and do certain things in the Kingdom
[43:55] with the same kind of authority that his
[43:57] father had
[44:00] so now that starts with virtue and that
[44:02] virtue what is strength and Powers not
[44:04] being a virgin it's good to be a virgin
[44:07] but it means strength and power a
[44:10] virtuous woman a bride is a crown to her
[44:12] husband you and I are the crowning
[44:15] effect of Jesus Christ you and I don't
[44:18] worry we got you know the Bible says
[44:20] talk about crowns and crowns and crowns
[44:22] don't worry there's not gonna be cement
[44:23] crowns on your head
[44:25] because the Bible says we throw them all
[44:26] down at his feet and we crowd him king
[44:29] of kings and him Lord of lords I ain't
[44:32] worried about a crown that's right
[44:35] listen you know why they put crowns on
[44:37] people's head
[44:39] you know why
[44:43] Authority number one but in the Greek
[44:45] when they had an Olympics
[44:48] if you won the Olympics they gave you a
[44:50] crown
[44:52] that was your that was what you wanted
[44:54] for finishing the race
[44:56] a lot of times it wasn't a crown that
[44:58] you see but it was a crown it was
[44:59] something it was something what to say
[45:01] hey this guy he ran this race anyone
[45:07] listen when you were in that witness
[45:09] racing and and when you're not gonna get
[45:11] a great big Crown you are the Clown
[45:16] hello
[45:18] but he didn't maketh ashamed his
[45:19] rottenness in his bones
[45:21] so now let's talk about knowledge
[45:24] everybody with me are we good today
[45:27] hot up here and besides just giving all
[45:29] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[45:32] to Virtue knowledge what does knowledge
[45:34] mean knowledge means no cease now watch
[45:37] what it means too though in the big
[45:39] letters such as belongs to the more
[45:41] advanced
[45:44] okay you say well brother I'm I'm I'm
[45:46] I'm just a baby you have an opportunity
[45:51] to know more
[45:53] it has been presented to you
[45:55] it's given to you in Book and Tape form
[45:57] it's given to you on Sunday and on
[45:59] Wednesday
[46:00] if you want to know where to find God he
[46:02] comes in this door at night about 9 30
[46:04] when y'all get down and sit down in the
[46:06] Pew and then he leaves with you and
[46:09] comes back at two o'clock Where's God
[46:12] well I just told you
[46:17] oh so you just believe this is just a
[46:18] place we come when we see it
[46:20] no
[46:23] Heavenly places is your position the
[46:25] prophet of God said your position in
[46:27] Christ that's Heavenly places is him
[46:30] being able to put you as a teacher and
[46:32] as a Sunday School director and as a
[46:34] song leader and as a piano player and a
[46:37] music player and thank God for all these
[46:39] musicians we got I wish we had a stage
[46:40] enough to put all of them but I you know
[46:42] what
[46:44] maybe we can
[46:46] do it and shifts or something maybe I
[46:47] don't know but we got so many musicians
[46:49] now I praise God for that because you're
[46:51] using your talent even a little Sarah in
[46:53] different ones they're being playing the
[46:54] piano amen I'm playing the piano and
[46:57] then Ryan jumps up here and plays the
[46:59] piano one day
[47:01] hmm
[47:04] such as belong to the more advanced
[47:07] especially if things look lawful and
[47:09] unlawful for Christians
[47:11] discern we'll get into that in just a
[47:13] second moral wisdom such as as seen in
[47:16] right living
[47:18] Psalms 139 23 says search me o God and
[47:22] know my heart
[47:24] my heart
[47:26] try me
[47:28] oh we don't want that part
[47:30] we don't want that part let's leave that
[47:31] one out
[47:32] no try me and know my thoughts
[47:38] and see if there be any wicked way in me
[47:42] I love that song too by the way lead me
[47:45] in the way
[47:47] Everlasting Isaiah 55 7 says let the
[47:50] wicked forsake his way and the
[47:52] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[47:54] return unto the Lord and He will have
[47:56] mercy upon him and to our God for he
[47:58] will abundantly pardon
[48:01] listen we're all thieves murders Liars
[48:03] Stealers adulterers
[48:05] David
[48:08] he said right here he abundantly pardon
[48:10] you for my thoughts are not your
[48:13] thoughts
[48:14] neither are your ways my way saith the
[48:16] Lord for as the heavens are higher than
[48:19] the earth so are my ways higher than
[48:21] your ways and my thoughts than your
[48:24] thoughts
[48:25] that's the Old Testament but when we
[48:26] come over to the New Testament Paul says
[48:28] we need to have the mind of Christ
[48:30] we need to think his thoughts did we get
[48:32] brother Brown comes up and said you will
[48:34] think it starts when you keep coming up
[48:35] as Faith virtue and all the temple
[48:37] patience then you become a Powerhouse
[48:42] Powerhouse
[48:45] not a refrigerator
[48:47] that makes ice cubes
[48:50] you don't Ice Cube does
[48:53] you know what icicle does
[48:56] that's an icicle
[49:00] you get fire got built under you one day
[49:02] you'll see what's going on
[49:04] get out of the refrigerator
[49:07] and out of the ground made the Lord to
[49:08] grow every tree and here we go with the
[49:10] Tree of Life in the midst of the garden
[49:11] now we know who is that that's Jesus
[49:13] Christ we're not we understand that all
[49:15] right it was a person it wasn't a tree
[49:17] growing in the ground it was a person
[49:18] the tree of life and immense look in the
[49:21] midst of the garden
[49:24] in the heart of the garden
[49:26] it's where that tree of life should be
[49:28] but we chose the tree of knowledge of
[49:30] Good and Evil to be in that place
[49:33] he said I didn't have a choice yeah
[49:34] brother Brown said you did by accepting
[49:37] what Adam and Eve did
[49:39] and the Lord said behold the man has
[49:42] become as one of us this is after the
[49:43] fall to no good and evil and now lest he
[49:47] put forth his hand he take also of the
[49:49] tree of life and eat and live forever in
[49:51] other words there was no Gap God had to
[49:54] take that and make a gap or an enmity he
[49:56] had to get away from man
[49:59] come on somebody
[50:00] he put He did he cut I can't stand that
[50:03] sin no more I can't walk in the garden
[50:05] with you I know what you've done
[50:08] and also taking the tree life and eat
[50:09] and live forever therefore the Lord God
[50:11] sent him forth from the Garden of Eden
[50:14] to till the ground from when she was
[50:15] taken so he drove out the man and he
[50:18] placed him at the east of the Garden of
[50:19] Eden cherubims and flaming swords which
[50:22] turned every way to keep the way of the
[50:25] tree of life but he did not say that
[50:28] you'll never get back to the Tree of
[50:29] Life
[50:31] because he became the Tree of Life
[50:33] he said I am the way the truth and the
[50:35] life the cherubims didn't what brought
[50:37] brother Brown tell us he told us the
[50:39] cherubims were there to keep us from
[50:41] that
[50:42] but he said now by the baptism of the
[50:44] Holy Ghost those cherubims are what
[50:47] they're giving authority to lead us back
[50:49] to the Tree of Life to get us back in
[50:52] the Garden of Eden
[50:53] if y'all like this place I'm just sorry
[50:55] I do not like this place
[51:01] the Lord God commanded man instead of
[51:03] every tree of the garden you'll eat
[51:04] freely eat all you want
[51:06] but of the tree of knowledge of Good and
[51:08] Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the
[51:11] day that you eat it therefore Thou shalt
[51:14] surely
[51:15] die
[51:16] and we know that man has died ever since
[51:19] amen Adam died 900 something years old
[51:22] but Adam died Eve died probably 900
[51:25] something years old she died
[51:27] my two's really different ones they all
[51:29] died every man's died we know there's
[51:31] anak and then you know that's another
[51:33] whole sermon and Jesus Christ even died
[51:37] oh
[51:39] Jesus died okay the Christ didn't die
[51:42] the Holy Ghost didn't die but Jesus the
[51:44] body died
[51:46] nobody with me on that all right he
[51:48] didn't become Jesus listen now he didn't
[51:50] become Jesus the human until 2000 years
[51:52] ago
[51:55] hello he was theophany God he was
[51:57] Jehovah how many times we've been
[51:59] preached on Genesis 1 26. that was
[52:01] theophany that was fair God
[52:03] but that Spirit God had to become flesh
[52:06] and dwell Among Us and be born from a
[52:09] virgin had to be born from a womb just
[52:11] like you were
[52:13] to take on what our sin
[52:16] he came down in the midst of this Garden
[52:19] to take away the mist from this Garden
[52:23] mist
[52:25] everybody with me some of you got that
[52:26] you smiled some of you still well you
[52:28] got to open your eyes to be able to
[52:29] smile
[52:30] they said these
[52:32] are in this right
[52:36] in the Book of Revelations I Know Thy
[52:38] works and thy labor is my patience and
[52:40] how count thou cannot bear them which
[52:42] are evil
[52:44] Corinthians and all the different ones
[52:45] they had false Doctrine back in the
[52:47] first church age and thou has tried them
[52:49] when say the apostles and are not and
[52:52] has found them Liars they were tried
[52:54] and found to be liars and that's born in
[52:56] patience and for my name's sake has
[52:58] labored and not fainted nevertheless I
[53:01] have something against it because I've
[53:02] left thy first love
[53:06] remember therefore from West our fault
[53:09] remember
[53:10] where you fell from remember where you
[53:13] you saw what you just said I couldn't
[53:15] fall I didn't say you couldn't backslide
[53:18] you're a Christian you backslide but
[53:20] like brother Brown said you sent us in
[53:22] you'll reap it up for
[53:25] look at David

[53:48] half-sister and they took over the
[53:50] kingdom and Absalon and all the
[53:51] different ones and all that was one it
[53:53] was really horrible
[53:55] come from David's loins
[53:57] but there wasn't Solomon that came to
[53:58] you

[56:03] knowledge like I said before me and Whom
[56:06] Shall he make to understand Doctrine me
[56:08] then there are weaned from the milk and
[56:09] drawn from the breast will continue with
[56:11] knowledge this is what man says about
[56:13] knowledge it's the fact or condition of
[56:15] knowing something with familial
[56:17] familiarity I always had a hard time
[56:19] saying that the other day it's in other
[56:21] words that's familiar
[56:23] gain through what
[56:27] experience
[56:29] our association
[56:33] acquaintance with their understanding of
[56:35] science art
[56:37] technique
[56:39] the fact or condition of being aware of
[56:42] something you have a knowledge of
[56:43] something there's a knowledge that
[56:45] something's going on in this building
[56:46] today there's a knowledge that
[56:47] something's going on in your everyday
[56:49] life there's a knowledge of something
[56:50] that's going on in your family life

[57:10] mine's gonna look like an MMA fighter
[57:14] they lost
[57:17] but praise God we got one
[57:21] brother said what Believers have angels
[57:27] and you know what they're not one of
[57:29] them if they're from God they're not
[57:30] contrary to God
[57:32] they have the mind of God
[57:37] so they're not going to steer you wrong
[57:38] if somebody steers you wrong that's the
[57:40] other guy got involved
[57:41] the fact they're conditioned to being
[57:43] aware of something the range of one's
[57:46] information or understanding now see
[57:48] that's man's knowledge of being a doctor
[57:50] or or or you know having all these
[57:53] degrees but not with God
[57:56] we had a seventh grade education man
[57:58] that couldn't say much he probably
[57:59] couldn't say that word either
[58:01] but you know what I understood
[58:02] everything he said
[58:05] there wasn't one time I said what'd he
[58:07] say
[58:08] no I know exactly what he was talking
[58:10] because he's talking like me
[58:12] the Bible said Jesus the Common People
[58:14] heard him gladly he must have spoke a
[58:15] very common language the circumstance or
[58:19] condition of what apprehending truth
[58:23] we're not going to be stabs to a perfect
[58:25] man apprehending false Doctrine
[58:29] or factory reasoning Proverbs 3 verse 13
[58:31] says happy as a man that findeth wisdom
[58:34] and the man that geteth understanding
[58:36] for the merchandise of it is better than
[58:39] the merchand National Silver and the
[58:40] game therefore a fight goal listen it's
[58:42] good to have money but I'm going to tell
[58:44] you something it's gonna burn that's
[58:50] money's not going to get us out of here
[58:54] and if we love it it's the root of all
[58:55] evil not it's not bad to have it but it
[58:58] says the love of money is the root of
[59:00] all evil
[59:01] see it's more precious than rubies who
[59:03] is she now look I'll stop here just a
[59:05] second
[59:06] who's he talking about
[59:09] what you talking about
[59:11] he talks about wisdom talks about
[59:14] understanding and happy is the man that
[59:16] findeth this
[59:18] so this she is not the man
[59:22] this she is you
[59:25] Miss wisdom
[59:27] Miss Grace not disgrace Miss Grace
[59:32] she is more precious than rubies and all
[59:35] the things thou cast desire are not can
[59:38] be to be compared unto her Length of
[59:41] days is in her right hand and then her
[59:43] left hand riches and honor that's the
[59:45] kind I want her ways are ways of
[59:48] pleasantness and all her paths are peace
[59:51] she is a tree of life
[59:53] she is a tree of life not he
[59:57] we've been transformed
[59:59] she is him
[1:00:01] can you believe that
[1:00:03] she is a tree of life to them that what
[1:00:05] lay hold upon her
[1:00:08] and happy
[1:00:09] is everyone that retaineth her
[1:00:14] you know what retain means hold
[1:00:17] so you can use it you put you give a
[1:00:20] lawyer
[1:00:21] a retainer and that in other words that
[1:00:24] makes him wear when you call him he's
[1:00:26] got to answer your phone call he don't
[1:00:28] blow you off you give him a retainer all
[1:00:30] right you give him something to hold on
[1:00:32] to what you got well happy is everyone
[1:00:34] that what retaineth her
[1:00:36] the Bible says that if you're good to a
[1:00:39] saint God to be good to you
[1:00:41] a cup of water in my name will not be
[1:00:43] forgotten that's why the the the the the
[1:00:45] glory and honor of God is inside of you
[1:00:48] today
[1:00:51] and the world is only being held
[1:00:53] together because we're still here
[1:00:56] only thing that's holding us together
[1:00:58] because I'm telling you the Gentiles
[1:01:00] will absolutely destroy each other
[1:01:03] they all they all want to destroy Israel
[1:01:05] anyway so they're destroying they're
[1:01:07] going to destroy their self and then
[1:01:09] they're going what circle around Israel
[1:01:12] and then who's going to come on and
[1:01:13] saying God's going to fight for Israel
[1:01:15] because he can't forget them even though
[1:01:17] he divorced him even though they went
[1:01:18] out and sinned and did the things they
[1:01:20] did God said I'll not ever forget Israel
[1:01:23] because I was once married to you and
[1:01:26] you turned away from me I had to give
[1:01:29] you a writing a divorcement so I can
[1:01:30] take a gentile bride
[1:01:32] knowledge now that don't mean world in
[1:01:34] all this because that's foolishness to
[1:01:36] God
[1:01:37] but knowledge to judge let me stop right
[1:01:39] here real quick you kids go to school
[1:01:42] get you a diploma
[1:01:45] a degree you can't make it in this world
[1:01:48] without it
[1:01:50] I'm sorry if the if time tarries I do
[1:01:53] not want to see you you're going to
[1:01:54] struggle enough with a degree
[1:01:57] hey man
[1:01:58] so get an education
[1:02:00] all right
[1:02:02] whether it be homeschooling or what I'm
[1:02:04] I'm not I'm I any time you can get a
[1:02:08] diploma it doesn't matter to me how you
[1:02:09] get it but you need to get a diploma you
[1:02:11] need to go to school
[1:02:15] because that's foolishness to God but
[1:02:16] now some of that junk they're teaching
[1:02:18] with creationism and are not creationism
[1:02:20] but Darwinism and all that stuff you can
[1:02:22] be a you got to be the Holy Ghost to
[1:02:24] your kids if they bring that stuff home
[1:02:26] go to that teacher
[1:02:28] say we don't believe in Darwin we're
[1:02:30] Christians We Believe see you stand up
[1:02:32] for if you'll stand up for me I'll stand
[1:02:35] up for you I'm reading the Bible
[1:02:38] knowledge to what judge what right from
[1:02:40] wrong how do you judge it you don't
[1:02:42] judge it by emotion don't judge it by
[1:02:44] feeling you judge by the word of God
[1:02:46] then if you've got Christian knowledge
[1:02:48] with your virtue and Faith you judge
[1:02:51] whether the word is right or wrong you
[1:02:54] judged one day that trinitarianism was
[1:02:57] right but it was a wrong judgment
[1:03:01] but one day when you saw the truth
[1:03:03] something inside of you just like sister
[1:03:06] had to write said that ain't nothing but
[1:03:07] the truth
[1:03:08] this message when you see this message
[1:03:10] and you see see the message
[1:03:14] you gotta say in your soul that ain't
[1:03:15] nothing but the truth
[1:03:18] now you're getting knowledge
[1:03:20] that's Supreme knowledge you don't have
[1:03:23] to have four degrees in some college or
[1:03:25] something like that to have it because
[1:03:26] all these virtues are given to you by
[1:03:28] God to place upon the foundation of your
[1:03:30] faith that you might come to the full
[1:03:32] stature of a real living man and woman
[1:03:35] of God
[1:03:36] all right
[1:03:38] all right let me continue let me get
[1:03:39] through some of this you don't add
[1:03:40] nothing because it ain't you ain't got
[1:03:42] it to add what you got to do you haven't
[1:03:44] got knowledge enough to know of God yet
[1:03:45] that the Bible doesn't contradict itself
[1:03:47] I think everybody's sitting in this room
[1:03:49] we don't have any strangers Among Us I
[1:03:50] think everybody in this room understands
[1:03:52] that the word of God's right
[1:03:53] amen and that's what we live by amen and
[1:03:56] we live by the enhanced version of the
[1:03:58] message of the hour with the Bible all
[1:04:00] right it's not another Bible it's not
[1:04:02] something instead of the Bible it's the
[1:04:04] Bible completely just like
[1:04:08] to me that's what this message is when
[1:04:09] you read the message and you get a
[1:04:10] revelation you're like pow
[1:04:13] man
[1:04:15] it can't be no way how many times you
[1:04:16] sit down look at something you go
[1:04:19] well it couldn't be no way other way
[1:04:21] than that but millions of other people
[1:04:23] think it's that way
[1:04:25] why Revelation we're going to get to
[1:04:27] that in a minute
[1:04:28] but when you can see that scripture is
[1:04:31] not contradictory that you can say that
[1:04:34] and can see by revelation of God look
[1:04:37] the whole world the whole word is
[1:04:38] written in mystery and only the
[1:04:41] knowledge of God can reveal it
[1:04:43] man can't do it like I said before when
[1:04:46] I was praying God you revealed to these
[1:04:48] people
[1:04:49] before I come out I said God you
[1:04:50] revealed something to these people
[1:04:55] that you can say that and can see that
[1:04:57] by the revelation of God the whole word
[1:04:59] is wrote in Mysteries and only the
[1:05:01] knowledge of God can reveal it
[1:05:05] then when you get and say punctuated
[1:05:06] with a amen then add that
[1:05:09] to your faith but around us pray and
[1:05:11] Build Me Up Lord into this let Christ be
[1:05:13] my head that working through me
[1:05:15] on my Foundation my faith is in him that
[1:05:18] virtue and all his temper patience
[1:05:19] godliness brotherly kindness
[1:05:21] work in Me O Lord is my prayer I don't
[1:05:23] care live or die sinkered around
[1:05:26] have we come to that
[1:05:29] this is I I'm sold to this message
[1:05:32] I'm sold to this message of the hour you
[1:05:36] can bring me something else
[1:05:38] that's okay you're wasting your time
[1:05:42] you know the old brother always said I
[1:05:45] rest my soul on Malachi 4.
[1:05:48] well I don't rest my soul exactly on
[1:05:51] what Malachi 4 says I rested on the
[1:05:53] whole Bible all right but I do rest it
[1:05:55] on Malachi 4 that he sent me a prophet
[1:06:00] for God has set in a church Apostles
[1:06:01] prophets teachers pastors and
[1:06:03] evangelists All For What the Perfection
[1:06:04] of the Saints and bringing all these
[1:06:06] virtues into it for the Perfection of
[1:06:08] the coming of the Son of God each one of
[1:06:10] these stones are a material off of that
[1:06:12] one this is the material off this he's
[1:06:14] talking about the taxi perfect man
[1:06:16] belonging into them they're pouring out
[1:06:18] of him down through them
[1:06:20] amen
[1:06:22] real quick
[1:06:23] the prophet of God told us
[1:06:25] in the 70th week of Daniel he said the
[1:06:27] spirit of wisdom is coming into the
[1:06:29] church
[1:06:32] now
[1:06:34] if you look where brother Randall was
[1:06:35] standing just for a minute look where he
[1:06:36] was standing
[1:06:38] all right there was Baptist
[1:06:40] Pentecostal Methodist
[1:06:43] Oneness
[1:06:45] job Witness
[1:06:47] Mormons
[1:06:49] all sitting in the congregation
[1:06:51] they all thought they had the spirit of
[1:06:53] wisdom
[1:06:55] amen
[1:06:57] I think some people would kill you for
[1:06:59] their religion
[1:07:02] or at least hate you
[1:07:04] if you're against that religion
[1:07:08] but the prophet of God said the spirit
[1:07:09] of wisdom comes into the church to make
[1:07:11] known to the church by the revelation of
[1:07:15] the Holy Ghost
[1:07:17] bringing the church in and revealing
[1:07:19] what day we're living in
[1:07:22] we're not living in Baptist day
[1:07:24] Methodist day Pentecostal day we're
[1:07:26] living in the day of the coming of the
[1:07:28] son of man
[1:07:29] that's what we're trying to get to but
[1:07:30] we've got to get the Son of God
[1:07:31] solidified and know that you know that
[1:07:34] you know that God can put that top on
[1:07:36] top listen building a house building a
[1:07:39] building
[1:07:40] make sure what Foundation is good first
[1:07:43] when somebody comes in
[1:07:46] to build something in the city of
[1:07:48] Gillsville we have a
[1:07:50] he stops at the foundation
[1:07:52] because we got an inspector that comes
[1:07:54] and inspects that Foundation to make
[1:07:56] sure it's up to code first
[1:07:59] then he puts the walls up puts the
[1:08:01] sticks up puts everything together
[1:08:03] and then he comes back out again and he
[1:08:06] inspects it to make sure
[1:08:08] it's sound
[1:08:10] then you put your roof on then you're
[1:08:12] stuck then after that he really don't
[1:08:13] have to come around until the very end
[1:08:15] of it almost what would it be really gay
[1:08:16] would be electrical and plumbing and
[1:08:18] stuff like that but that has nothing to
[1:08:20] do with the structure
[1:08:22] structure of the house at the two before
[1:08:23] is the foundation the two before is the
[1:08:25] blocks yeah and the rafters
[1:08:28] um we were talking one time about
[1:08:29] changing the roof of this and and it it
[1:08:32] sound as it is but like Brother Gary
[1:08:34] said we keep we add more
[1:08:36] thank God for somebody like really gay
[1:08:37] see somebody with some understanding
[1:08:40] because I'm like build it
[1:08:43] what's wrong two by fours
[1:08:46] two percents you got a nail gun
[1:08:49] I'll buy you some nails
[1:08:52] brother gas here bro waiting until then
[1:08:54] walks can't handle that pressure
[1:08:57] he said I'd have to put like pylons or
[1:09:00] something down the down the side of this
[1:09:02] building he said oh the walls would bow
[1:09:03] because of the most more pressure that
[1:09:05] we put on the ceiling well see it took
[1:09:07] somebody like him to stop some dummy
[1:09:09] like me or we'd all be flat as a pancake
[1:09:13] because I believe if I pushed him he
[1:09:14] might have built him
[1:09:16] but he'd be going um
[1:09:20] but you know what that's the Holy Ghost
[1:09:22] now you I believe he's got the Holy
[1:09:24] Ghost but that was just knowledge of
[1:09:26] what he was doing was telling me without
[1:09:28] that knowledge
[1:09:29] yeah they'd look really pretty to have a
[1:09:32] great big tall roof but the walls can't
[1:09:34] handle it
[1:09:36] thank God for a master builder that we
[1:09:40] go oh I want to do this Lord I want to
[1:09:42] do this I want to go get this job I want
[1:09:44] to do this I want to do that thank God
[1:09:46] for master builder says no you can't do
[1:09:48] that
[1:09:49] and I'm going to tell you why I'm gonna
[1:09:50] give you the code book and I'm okay you
[1:09:53] go back to this code book that code book
[1:09:55] will tell you how to build your house
[1:09:57] it'll tell you how to be a Powerhouse of
[1:09:59] God
[1:10:02] he's got to know your code
[1:10:05] and you know what code is code is a
[1:10:07] revelation
[1:10:08] you got to get the Revelation all right
[1:10:10] let's do this real quick and we'll wait
[1:10:11] until this afternoon the spirit of
[1:10:13] wisdom and understanding brother Brown
[1:10:15] said the spirit of wisdom will come back
[1:10:17] into the church Spirit of wisdom not
[1:10:19] just the spirit a spirit of wisdom will
[1:10:21] come into the church that we can say
[1:10:23] Amen to what amen and kick out what's
[1:10:25] not right
[1:10:27] the spirit of wisdom and understand the
[1:10:28] spirit of counsel and might the spirit
[1:10:31] of knowledge of the fear of the Lord
[1:10:33] Ephesians 1 verse 17 that the god of our
[1:10:36] Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory
[1:10:38] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[1:10:40] in Revelation in the knowledge of him
[1:10:43] look that the eyes of your understanding
[1:10:45] to be enlightened that you may know
[1:10:49] what is the hope of his calling and what
[1:10:50] the rich of the glory of his inheritance
[1:10:52] in the Saints
[1:10:56] real quick right here musicians come on
[1:11:00] in Revelation of Jesus Christ brother I
[1:11:02] was talking about the Book of
[1:11:03] Revelations
[1:11:04] the consummation of the scripture
[1:11:07] place right where it needs to be where
[1:11:08] at the end
[1:11:09] now you can know why it says that Anyone
[1:11:11] who reads or even hears it is blessed
[1:11:13] it's a revelation of God to give you
[1:11:15] authority over the devil and you can see
[1:11:17] why they who would add or take from it
[1:11:20] would be cursed it would have to be
[1:11:24] so for who can add or take away from the
[1:11:27] perfect revelation of God and overcome
[1:11:29] the enemy it is simple
[1:11:31] there is nothing of such prevailing
[1:11:33] power
[1:11:35] as the revelation of the word of God
[1:11:38] no prevailing power
[1:11:40] nothing can overpower
[1:11:43] the word of God
[1:11:45] let's continue right here just for say
[1:11:47] everybody stand
[1:11:48] I admit it takes a real Revelation from
[1:11:50] the Holy Ghost to see the truth about
[1:11:52] the godhead these days when we're in the
[1:11:54] midst of perversion or perverting of so
[1:11:56] much scripture but the prevailing
[1:11:59] overcoming church is built on Revelation
[1:12:03] so we can expect God
[1:12:06] I've become expected
[1:12:09] we expect God to reveal his truth to us
[1:12:12] I expect that out of him because he's a
[1:12:15] good god he's a good father I just got
[1:12:17] to make myself available and quit being
[1:12:19] a renegade
[1:12:21] however you actually don't need a
[1:12:24] revelation on water baptism
[1:12:26] wow it is right there staring you in the
[1:12:30] face
[1:12:31] wow
[1:12:33] one more the fear of the Lord is the
[1:12:36] beginning of wisdom a good understanding
[1:12:37] here have all they that do his
[1:12:39] Commandments his praise endureth
[1:12:42] forever the fear of the Lord is
[1:12:44] beginning of knowledge but fools despise
[1:12:46] wisdom
[1:12:47] and instruction
[1:12:49] for the lord giveth wisdom out of his
[1:12:51] mouth cometh knowledge
[1:12:53] and understanding
[1:12:55] trust in the Lord with all your heart
[1:12:57] and love lean not on to your own
[1:12:59] understanding we listen we lean we lean
[1:13:03] to the human part all the time we know
[1:13:05] that
[1:13:06] we need to lean back the other direction
[1:13:08] because we know
[1:13:11] through wisdom is a house building just
[1:13:13] like I said about Brother Gary and by
[1:13:15] understanding look by understanding it's
[1:13:17] established brother Garrett has never
[1:13:19] built a house
[1:13:20] that he just built and it's just sitting
[1:13:22] there
[1:13:23] right
[1:13:25] somebody occupies that place it's an
[1:13:28] established home
[1:13:30] we've seen many times when we were doing
[1:13:32] uh foreclosed homes and stuff you leave
[1:13:35] a house you take even a perfectly good
[1:13:37] house and you leave it empty uh
[1:13:39] everybody's shaking their head already
[1:13:40] you leave it empty for six months three
[1:13:43] months six months you leave it for a
