I pray that you will anoint your word anoint your servant and anoint every ear Lord God meet every need Lord God tonight Amen in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen praise God uh let us open our Bible in the book of uh Psalms uh 139 uh let us read uh from verse 1 to verse 18 it says oh Lord thou Hast searched me and known me thou knowest my down seating and mine Uprising thou understandest my thought a far off thou compassest my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but la oh Lord thou knowest it all together amen thou Hast beset me behind and before and laay thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot attend unto it wheither shall I go from thy Spirit or wheither shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand Lead Me and the right hand shall hold me if I say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me ye the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee for thou Hast possessed my Reigns thou Hast covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrote in the lowest parts of the earth then eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in Contin which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee may the Lord a blessing upon the reading of his word and you may be be seated in the presence of the Lord now tonight uh I would like to share uh a simple uh word words of encouragement and uh and uh I am praying that uh this would be a blessing to every one of us tonight H Allelujah uh the title of my message is uh the great Shepherd watching over his sheep H Allelujah and uh he is watching over his sheep am and we have nothing to worry about anything every everything is in control of him amen H Allelujah and a lot of people they seem to have hard time and struggling to live a life of uh you know being a Christian but bar Braham said that uh now that is what I find around most Christian lives most I hate to say to say it that way but it's true the most people that uh that can profess Christianity they seem to have such a hard struggling time to hold on I believe it's because of a lack of correct teaching of the Bible amen there's no such a thing as holding on he done the holding on the whole Christian uh Christian principle is based upon rest come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden I will give you rest don't have to worry and struggle you are just resting that's all given rest you enter in peace that the whole things finished them who he who he has called he has Justified amen those he has Justified he has already glorified scripture quoting notice it's nothing that you do or what you can do it's what God has done for you in Christ Hallelujah so even in you know even in you know some people they are so about the ministry about uh what can they do for the Lord and how can uh how uh would they do it Hallelujah but brothers and sisters Hallelujah it is his duty his duty to care to take care of his his flock am and the only thing that we need to do is just to seek his perfect will and obey his Voice Hallelujah you know I remembered one time before uh Jesus uh ascended up on high he made sure that his sheep will be taken care of he asked uh Peter he said Simon son of junah lovest thou me and Peter said yes Lord I love you feed my lambs and then he asked the second time Peter oh Simon son of junah lovest thou me and Peter said yes Lord you know it I love you Lord hallelujah and he even one time he even complained we left our family we live my wife we live my our house our children and we've been following you and to show that he love our he loved the Lord and then the third time here comes Jesus ask him again the third time he said Simon son of junah lovest th me and maybe Peter was a little bit you know angry you know Lord hallelujah I Love You Lord and then Jesus said feed my sheep and maybe at that time Peter was thinking that the master was doubting his love for him but you know baham said that Jesus was only uh he was only doing what what Jesus was doing is to make sure that his sheep will be taken care of amen hallelujah amen and I remember one time uh when I got uh some uh uh bad feeling on my you know in my in my body and then uh I got sick and uh my wife asked me he said uh she said l in case the Lord will take you home who will be the pastor of the church and I said I don't know I don't care who will be the pastor it is not my church it is not my duty it is his duty Hallelujah it is his church if you think that uh we care for the church he care so much more than you care amen hallelujah now whe shall I go from thy Spirit or wether shall I flee from thy presence Hallelujah he is there amen he is everywhere you go and he even knows Hallelujah the intense of our hearts and our minds amen he knows uh David said he knows my down seting and my Uprising amen and he knows the end from the beginning and he he even have a plan before the foundation of the world am for every one of us Allelujah that's why Jesus came and died at the cross to redeem us and sealed us with that Holy Spirit of Promise Hallelujah which is the earnest of our in itance Hallelujah until the day of our full Redemption amen hallelujah Bram said this Holy Spirit that's in me now will see to it that I have a young Immortal body and never go with the Holy Spirit that's in you will see that the gray hairs will fade away and whatever it is amen hallelujah you know right brother sometimes great brother some people uh told me to put colors on my you know my hair and I remember one time my youngest son when uh I think he was in uh Elementary and he when I uh uh took him to to the school and he he he he he said t they called me T why don't you put colors on new hair I said just leave it alone one day I will be a a black hair it will be black yes and then my son said if you will not put color on your hair and my classmates will ask me who who that man is and I will tell them that's my grandfather Hallelujah I I'm not worry one day that's right Hallelujah and you the old age if you are so old and whiskers down and walking like that it don't make one bit uh one bit of difference that same Holy Spirit he will just snap it right back at the day just at a young man and woman that's the Bible That's right The Spirit that's in us now right now amen not the one that will come the one that's in us now it's God in you now and he will raise you can raise yourself up and why can't you do it now because see there's scripture holding holding you you got to wait till that yeah till the Rapture Hallelujah if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold thou are there the Sheep Allelujah cannot be out of sight from the eyes Hallelujah of that great Shepherd I I remember the uh the story of bham when he was in the Oriental country and uh somebody was driving for him and uh suddenly all the vehicles stopped and he was wondering why it stopped they stopped and then uh after a while uh they saw a bunch of of sheep and then somebody The Herder was uh the shepherd was leading them and baram said that uh he saw uh things that could be eaten by this by by the Sheep but the Sheep did not touch anything anything of them H Allelujah and then he asked the driver why is it that the ship didn't eat H Allelujah and the driver said that uh the Sheep will not eat unless the shepherd will tell them Allelujah to it amen and then he said and then uh uh this driver told him told banham that uh uh you know there's a lot of you know people uh hering different uh uh different uh kind of animals some of them they are Hing uh cows and camels and donkeys and goats and sheep and all of them they are called past H Shepherds hallelujah amen but the difference between The Shepherd of the ship and The Shepherd of those cows and camels and everyone on and all of them that the Shepherds during night time they go home and all their cattles are left out in the field but The Shepherd of the ship amen H Allelujah they lay down among his sheep he said they all eat from the same field but he said Barham the strange thing about this is that the shepherd will watch over them and correct each one through the day but when night time comes the donkeys and the camels and the goats go out in the field but the sheer takes the ship in the shiple I said oh brother I want to be a sheep don't you and he said I often wondered what the St John 10 mean when he said I am the door to the shipold how could he being a man yet be a door right and I asked uh this good man the shepherd never lays down until he has counted amen he has counted every ship and then when he lays down he lays ac across the door and the ship will never go over the shepherd or the wolf cannot get to the ship without crossing the shepherd I said I'm so glad to be a sheep this time trials may come and go but some to be a sheep brother some glorious day he's going to take us to the shipold when the Sun goes down at the end of the day brothers and sisters that great sheer Shepherd will gather all his sheep and none of them will be left amen you remember now when Jesus uh he he gave a a parable about the the the shepherd with 100 sheep Hallelujah he already got the the 190 19 the 19 uh the 99 but he has to find that Hallelujah one ship and he will not allow Hallelujah that one ship will be lost amen hallelujah that's why even Bram said that Hallelujah when that last predestinated seed Hallelujah will come then the rupture will take place no one will be left no that's why the ministers the fold Ministry are doing everything they can Allelujah just to find that last predestinated SE Hallelujah and the Shepherds lying among his sheep watching to see that those little fellow Hallelujah he makes sure that those little fellow come into the kingdom in the right way Hallelujah I'm so glad that he's in on duty day and night Hallelujah he promised what his promises I will not leave you nor forsake you I will be with you even in you until the end of the world Amen Hallelujah if the Under Undertaker puts us hallelujah one of his ship under the ground and shoveled uh six six foot of dirt on top of him on top of him Hallelujah he could not be hid from the eyes of that sheep he is marked and one of this day Hallelujah he will call and we amen and I'll answer amen because the ship knows his know his voice you know when I arrived here in the church this evening I felt a little bit sad you know I remember brother Samuel Dale Allelujah how he he treated me you know that's right and uh every time I I come Allelujah and he went down from the house and to greet me and help me carry my luggages although I I don't allow him to do it Allelujah but he you know he always insist to help me right H Allelujah and uh one time I was a about to travel to Arkansas I was about to drive uh for if not I'm not mistaken about uh 12 hours drive and I had to leave at 5:00 in the morning so I set my alarm on uh at uh 4:00 and then I walk slowly to the bathroom and took shower Allelujah trying to not to disturb them I believe it's too early Allelujah in the morning and there I I was uh thinking they're sleeping you know and after I finished the packing up my my things and I walk slowly to the door and when I look to the kitchen he was already there sitting and he already have cooked for my breakfast and then he made the sandwich Allelujah that I can eat Hallelujah along the way so I really really miss those uh those days hallelujah but brothers and sisters hallelujah it's only for a while one day Hallelujah we will see him again Hallelujah that's why even David he says he don't worry Hallelujah he says though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil am for thou art with me my rod and my stuff they comfort me hallelujah it's you know a little bit sad because we don't see him right now but I believe that he is in a better Hallelujah in a better place than we have H Allelujah and even job the oldest book in the Bible he got no scripture to read in his day Hallelujah but God spoke to him through his creation he mentioned about the stars and the Orion and the pades and all this Allelujah God's creation and then he said for there is a hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will Sprout again and that the tender Branch thereof will not will not cease though the root thereof walks old in the earth and the stuck thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of the what of water it will B and bring forth boats like a plant if a man die Hallelujah shall he live again yes all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come amen Thou shalt call and I will answer thee amen hallelujah thou Willl have a desire to the work of thine hands Hallelujah I believe that if God Allelujah I believe he believed I mean job believe that if there is a Resurrection on this yes creation the trees God is also a God hallelujah he is also Hallelujah a God who created men amen hallelujah that's why he said for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the lat day upon the Earth amen and though after my skin worms destroy this body eat up this body Hallelujah yet in My Flesh in this flesh I shall see God Whom Shall uh whom I shall see for myself and not my eye Shall Behold and not another though my reins be consumed within Me Not Another Hallelujah now God is omnipresent watching over his ship amen if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Are there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there yes amen praise God Amen if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there just like Daniel yeah yeah Hallelujah he went into Babylon but he proposed himself that he was not going to defy himself Allelujah with King Smith right Hallelujah he was nothing to do with the world though he had to live among among them people but he purposed in himself that he was not going to defy him himself with the things of the world Hallelujah and one day the king threw him into the lion's den Hallelujah if I make my bed in hell thou are there amen hallelujah and because he was walking H Allelujah in the line of duty Hallelujah he was a sheep of that great Shepherd if I make my bed in hell behold thou are there amen and maybe before Daniel dropped Hallelujah into the ground that were there amen he was already there amen that Pillar of Fire was already there amen you know all wild animals they afraid fire Hallelujah that's why they could not come near to Daniel Hallelujah because before Daniel Hallelujah went into the pit th were there amen hallelujah amen and you know brothers and sisters maybe at the time this you know these people who got in way on Daniel because the king had uh you know gave him uh special treatment he he got a nice house maybe he got a nice bed Hallelujah and maybe at that time said oh now Daniel if you survive from The Lion and you are now lying on the ground Hallelujah but the thing that they didn't know Hallelujah Daniel at that night he got the smoothest pillow which is the skin of the the lion you know and warm with the body of the lion Hallelujah because before he went into the lion's den behold Thou Art there am Hallelujah believe am just like the three Hebrew children H Allelujah and they decided not to bow down to the image of the of King Nebuchadnezzar but before the threw them into the fairy fness the fourth man was already there amen hallelujah amen because they were faithful sheep of God Amen Hallelujah and maybe people that were watching them were so worried what would happen to them Hallelujah but if they were so worried for this uh three Hebrew children the great Shepherd is more worried for them and I like how reham dramatized it maybe I'm just going to read it because uh Hallelujah he said let's turn over let's turn our camera now amen all the time there's something going on down here there's something going on up there at the same time amen amen amen we only look to the Earthly side but let's look up there my I can see him sitting there in his majesty oh my his kingly Priestly garments hanging around him sitting there I can see a great angel coming up you believe God got angels in heaven they are in his at his command is that right I can see one of them come up he called warm mood he is the Angel over all the waters I can see him wrestled up quick uh up beside beside of the throne and say master have you looked down there why they are fixing to burn up three faithful Believers I can hear the master say yes wood I've watched them all night long amen aren't you glad brothers and sisters we have a God we have a great Shepherd watching Hallelujah all night long brother his eyes is on the sparrow and I know he watches over he watches me I know he sees everything that's going on right here now he knows and not even a sparrow could fall in the streets I heard wormwood say back in the in the anti thean destruction you give me the authority and I broke up all the fountains you know wormwood up there has control of the water he said I've washed the whole thing off let me go down this morning and I'll wash by babon off the face of the earth I believe he could done it amen you say he you say well I tell you I can't let you go here comes another Angel who's he maybe he's Michael let's think he's Michael the great angel that stand in the presence of God I can see him draw his sword and say master look down there one more step and that's right before them have you considered them so Michael was worry W warmwood was so worried Hallelujah yes let me go down we'll see who B when we when we get down there I believe he could done it don't you I can hear him say Michael you have obeyed me since the day that I created you but I can't let you go because I'm going myself this is a mansiz job my my I can see him Rise Up from his seat his robe drop around around him walk out there and say way back over there in the north I can see the great big white Thunderhead I can hear him say come here amen everything in the

thunder head I'm going to drive you like horses this morning we take uh that big Thunderhead step out on it like a chariot reach up and get a hold of a zigzag lightning out of the skies and crack it across the sky King Nebuchadnezzar could hear it down on the earth down there and about the time uh he passed by the Sea of life and picked off a pal when they made uh their last step away all the bries like that talking over the future of them I tell you he's God today amen he knows all things hallelujah amen and he says David said if I may if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea Hallelujah God is there too Hallelujah you remember Daniel oh Jonah bam he got a message a man running from the presence of the Lord and he was trying to run away from the

Hallelujah he says my soul when my soul fainted Within Me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thine Holy Temple Hallelujah he remembered the prayer of Solomon right Hallelujah that if they people be in trouble and they will pray into this Temple and you will hear them amen hallelujah 2 Chronicles 6 29-30 when that prayer or what uh when uh then what prayer or what

Heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and Render unto every man according unto all his ways amen who heart thou knowest for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men Hallelujah and when Jonah Hallelujah remembered the prayer of Solomon and God honored it you can imagine brothers and sisters who was Solomon he became a box slider and if honored the prayer of a box leading man hallelujah how about if the Bride of Jesus Christ if a sincere heart Hallelujah will call hallelujah amen his great Shepherd and I believe that he will answer amen H Allelujah you know everything is under God's control amen everything is under his control amen you know it is God's program that every morning the sun will rise and it did not fail even one time Hallelujah you know in in the

and do even know the time when it will rise and it will and the sitting down of the sun yes amen hallelujah but brothers and sisters there are times that we cannot see the sun amen sometimes the skies are cloudy and stormy and we do not feel the heat of the Sun but the question is does it mean that there is no sun Hallelujah very good the sun behind the those clouds amen the sign is still shining amen and when God promise sometimes we don't feel his presence in our LS sometimes there are times that when we pray and it is dry you know we can feel his presence Hallelujah does it mean that God failed his promise that I will not leave you I will be with you always Hallelujah God's promise will not fail amen you remember brothers and sisters in the time of Elisha Allelujah that uh the king of Syria was planning to Ambush the king of Israel H Allelujah and he he planned uh uh several times that he Des set an ambush Allelujah they know they have this intelligence report that the king of Israel will pass this way and they set an ambush and then Elisha the prophet he told the king of Israel don't pass the that way because the king of uh the Syrian armies are there and they set an ambush and then uh the king of Israel sent a messenger Allelujah to see if it is true and then yes they are there so the king of Israel was saved not only the Bible says not only once twice and Christ but many times and then the king of Syria said said maybe there is a traitor Among Us H Allelujah and maybe there is one here that is for the king of Israel but one Army said no King but there is a king in Israel amen that tth Hallelujah all your plans y to the king amen hallelujah of Israel amen and then the king of Syria said okay we will fix that uh that prophet and maybe if you are going to enter into a you know into a uh Israel's territory you will not only bring one company or one battalion maybe Allelujah it would be a war yes Hallelujah maybe he brought all his armies and Hallelujah it says in Second Kings verse uh chapter 6 and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gun forth behold an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than the that be with them Hallelujah fear not for they that are that be with us are more than this that be with them and bar said Elisha did not see the host of God hallelujah he only believed what the word says the angel of the Lord Encompass round about them that fear Him and deliver them and then when Elisha prayed and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that they may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young men and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire around about Elijah Hallelujah sometimes we get so worried Hallelujah and even our healing sometimes we get so worried but if God promised Allelujah I am the god that Health all thy diseases I am the god that for forgiveth all thy trespasses H Allelujah sometimes you say oh it's still there I I still uh feel the pain but brothers and sisters just like Jonah he did not look on the symptom he did not look on the on the situation he look on the promise amen amen hallelujah amen I am the god that Health all th diseases Hallelujah baram said now they ought to have know he would have to everything had to obey him we ought to know the same thing our bodies will will have to obey his word amen I am the Lord that heals all thy diseases is that is that the word well this body has got to obey that amen I all I have to do is press the button amen sometimes the Buton is on the knees you know but I tell you that send a corrent fruit but that's all you do is believe it God promis it and as them waves had to obey him so does this have to obey him in so much that he promised after we are perished I'll raise him up again at that day amen and then braam said uh what if I will die tonight uh if I will die today God will re it Hallelujah God will R this body again amen hallelujah and you know sometimes if God has a purpose in our lives still have purpose in our lives that even sickness God has a purpose of it and Braham said you say baram uh I'm a Christian and I got a sickness I got a sickness now you know because uh you know there are some people that uh say oh he got sickness uh maybe God is you know is chastening him maybe he he done uh you know done wrong and God got angry on him that's why he got that sickness but bham said sometimes bam said that uh bham I'm a Christian and I got a sickness now I wonder why it come God may be purging you amen amen give give you some trials am make you draw a little closer to him pray a while then heal you that you can have testimony and said that even our sickness even in sickness God have purpose have a purpose in it Allelujah it's for his glorification Hallelujah and you know Brothers and Sisters Jesus always go where he's invited amen hallelujah and brother said that no matter where it's at he will come he come to all liance Den one time to appear farness and I remember brothers and sisters if we will just come before him allelu invite him right I believe that he will come amen said Jesus always go where he's invited am I remembered one time in the Bible when uh he was invited by Simon the Pharisee and braam dramatized that uh Simon he sent a messenger and to bring an invitation to Jesus Christ invited him to into his you know a party in his house Allelujah and Jesus he came and you know brothers and sisters when Jesus came he was just at the corner H Allelujah amen he was unwelcome H Allelujah you know and while uh Mary magdaline was you know washing his feet and wiping it with her long hair and this uh Pharisees Simon the Pharisees and other Pharisees they were you know talking about him oh they said that this is a pro this is a prophet if he is a prophet he should know Allelujah who is that woman what kind of woman Allelujah that's in her in his feet and Jesus knows it amen hallelujah he knows their hearts amen yes and he said Simon I have somewhat against you you invited me and you did not welcome me you did not wash my feet you did not anoint me with ointment you did not kiss me you did not put on Hallelujah a Rob on me Hallelujah do you think Jesus didn't know that he will just be insulted yeah at the time I believe he knows but why that he still came for that invitation and even a hypocrite the invitation of a hypocrite man he comes and how much more if a sincere believer amen we invite himen will he not come amen Hallelujah said he will come to the poorest to the richest to the most immoral to the meanest to the lowest he will come wherever he's invited no matter what your conditions and position in life is amen he will still come amen hallelujah you remember a parable that Jesus uh a parable concerning the unjust judge Hallelujah he says and he speak a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to fame Hallelujah he is encouraging us to pray always to pray he said ask what you will he is the the one who is telling us to ask do you think after telling us to ask and then when we ask he will not give what we need Hallelujah saying there was a city there was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regard regarded men right and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying AV me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor regarded man yet because this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust Jud sayi Jesus he was comparing the best father and the evil judge Hallelujah one time he said you evil Father Knows to give good things unto your children if you if your children will ask bread will you give him Stone if your children will will will uh ask for fish will you give them snake and he said if you evil father imagine he is comparing himself the very best father into an evil one if the evil one knows how to give good things how much more the very best father hallelujah thank you Lord in Romans 8 chapter 3 uh in rans 8:32 he said he that spared not his own son but delivered but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things amen now he compared his own begotten son and then this little material things you know brother and sisters especially in the Philippines there's a lot of poor people in the Phil Philippines and when one of their families in the family is in trouble is in si is sick H Allelujah and they do not have money they have to sell the coconut field the rice field the carabo even house they have to sell it just to save son it means means things is nothing compared to a son am Hallelujah right but then he says if uh he said he that spared not his own son amen gave the most important one shall he not give this you know yeah things that are not more important than the sun right Hallelujah shall he not with him also so freely give us all things Hallelujah the question is when did God give his own son the Bible says while we were yet sinners Hallelujah when you were Sinners when you were filthy when you do not please him and he give how much more amen when you are now believers when you are the Bride of Jesus Christ Matthew 10 29-31 are not two Sparrow sold for a farting and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear ye not therefore ye are more valuable value more value more value than many Sparrow Hallelujah am what are Sparrow it's good here in in the states be because uh even you see this you know these birds you just leave them alone but in in the Philippines sometimes there are some naughty boys and they are they have this slingshot and Sh that sparrows and then they shooting them just leave them there why because they are just nothing Hallelujah nothing for the children but for God Amen H Allelujah amen he took care of them he takes care of them yeah and if God takes care Hallelujah this little creature Jesus said ye are more Hallelujah we are of more value than many SPS Hallelujah but sometimes we are when we are praying it seems that God is silent h Allelujah and he don't answer our

working and you know brothers and sisters while the Earth is traveling in such speed and then there is a moon Hallelujah traveling with the Earth and did it and it did not hit one time amen it means everything is under God's control amen that's why we don't have nothing to worry amen when we became a Believer Hallelujah everything is in control that's why you it might be you know sometimes it might be you know not good for you but the Bible says in everything you have to give thanks Hallelujah all things work together for what for your own good amen Hallelujah and brothers and sisters God is always right on time amen he never gone late no h Allelujah you remember in the time of lazaros when lazaros uh got sick and then uh Martha and Mary Des sent somebody to call for their Master when lazaros was sick maybe Martha and Mary no problem Hallelujah just no problem if Jesus healed others Allelujah I believe that he will heal Lazarus because the word that the use is in John 11 3-4 therefore his sister sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest Hallelujah they are really confident you know he whom thou lovest is sick Hallelujah and then they waited Allelujah until Lazarus died and Jesus did not come and maybe they were so upset H Allelujah they were very sad you know every time he come to our house you know we entain him Martha maybe I cook for him you know and now that we need him Hallelujah and he did not come H Allelujah and then when Jesus came and Martha ran and met him and she said unto him Lord if you were just if you were here lazaros have not died Hallelujah it means you are late it's been four days since he died you know when lazaros was sick they were expecting healing Hallelujah but Jesus wanted them to see more than that amen Mary and Martha wanted they wanted to see healing H Allelujah but they been seen many times that Jesus heal Hallelujah but you you know Jesus wanted them to see more than that more than what they are expecting amen Jesus wanted them to see Resurrection amen you know sometimes Lord give me this thing I've been praying for this and then but brothers and sisters sometimes God answers yes sometimes no sometimes he got more better things than you are asking right Hallelujah now God is always on time amen hallelujah what if Elijah was late Allelujah when this widow woman you know was picking up sticks to cook a handful of meal what if Elijah was late for 30 minutes H Allelujah but God was on time amen what if the whale was late 14 minutes Hallelujah imagine Jonah his hands were tied and his feet were tied hallelujah how can he swim can he survive 10 minutes or maybe a sharp had eaten up junah but God was there on time what if God was late for 5 minutes to rescue the three Hebrew children would they survive 5 minutes when the king when they heit it up the the f is seven times and even those who through them Hallelujah died hallelujah what if God was late for 5 minutes even 2 minutes hallelujah
