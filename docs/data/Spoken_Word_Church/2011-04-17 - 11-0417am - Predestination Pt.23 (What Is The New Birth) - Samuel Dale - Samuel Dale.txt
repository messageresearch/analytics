asleep all things continued for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the waters and in the the water that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but be not

with the children and playing and stuff like that and everybody's kind of red-faced today because we got out in the wind and the sun for about uh probably about eight or nine hours for some of us coming really really had a good time but we appreciate everything that everybody done to fixing up and the cooking and the doings and and preparing and getting everything ready we really we really just appreciate it and and you know thank you very much for for doing it and for all that you've done because there's many things brother al made the chili and it was it was real good he always does

something but we'll try to do that all right uh john three you know something that something keeps coming on my mind but i can't get it out of what it is it's gonna supposed to announce but anyhow we'll think of it after a while and i'll say it oh we appreciate uh brother uh uh richard and brother joe for fixing up now if you look up here and you see the wires don't go haywire you don't see them from back there anyway but don't go haywire and wonder what's going on this is a temporary situation to get us because we are on live streaming is that the way it says streaming today i say screaming but you know it is supposed to be live today and from now on in our services we appreciate them in their work they were up here the other night and working and we appreciate everything that's done around here for the to help and to do and you know we appreciate it all right the lord appreciates it because you're working for him okay father we thank you and we love you and we thank you for all things that you've given us and we know that you've given them to us freely these things so we just thank you we have just we want you to have your way in our lives is the main thing because we've gathered for that purpose it doesn't matter what you know mankind is or whatever we haven't gathered to see or to be seen we're not trying to go out into the world to be seen we're trying to go out into the world to try to help some that would desire to hear and we know and realize that a lot of people gets offended when you try to open up and and speak what you believe but yet that's up to them so we appreciate everything you've allowed us to do around here and help the people and you get the word out to those that they're supposed to hear and father we love you and we thank you we ask you to come now as we read your word and you speak to each one of our hearts god each one remember the sick ones among us and just bless each one lord in jesus name amen john 3 we just use this again for what we're getting into today verse 1 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus the ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that they are the teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him now remember how we were bringing out winds wednesday he he this wasn't just a five-minute conversation this is just what's written down as to what would take place if you've seen this in a movie uh you know projected of what was being seen it wouldn't just be it would be a 10 or 15 minute uh segment ever how you call that of of doing it to give you him coming in the greetings they sit down and talk they do things you know but it's just recorded what is here nicodemus wanted to know some things all right then and he comes to the right one well i went in when he did he says we know that he recognized the lord jesus that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest accept god be with him and jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god he can't understand me nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and our spirit the spirit he cannot enter now see you could see and then enter into the kingdom of god that is born of the flesh is flesh and that is which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee you must be born again you may be seated the lord have his blessings to the reading of the word now remember what we were bringing out wednesday night that if you look up the original translation you'll see that jesus was saying you must be born from above all right now nicodemus was expressing what it would be like to be born from the earth because it wouldn't do us any good no because he knew as i said wednesday night he he knew the teachings or else he would not come this wasn't a thornt temple of a coin you know and said well i think i'll go down and talk to him no he knew about him he'd heard about him he he wanted to meet the lord jesus and you know and see the things so he goes down and and has a conversation with him and in doing that he was trying to find out some things but as the lord jesus began to speak to him you know he said you must be born again well you know that threw a man for a luke that was uh thinking that everything was fine in his lineage and all of the things that's expressing wednesday but he said how can that be he said i know kind of your teaching your teachings is that that we was born wrong and now you're trying to tell me that i must be born again what does that mean well you say well a poor old man that's what we used to say in the baptist you know the poor old nicodemus all he had to do was believe well you know i'm not throwing off on nobody i'm just saying that a lot of people believed and didn't get saved nicodemus did put his life on the line his job on the line is his is a you know big high place position was on the line for the basis of what he was doing but now i was trying to get a point across this past wednesday to you that that i've been driving at for months and months and months you know and you know that i made this statement no telling how many times that see the soul of an individual we we look at bodies we can see them we can see manifestations of uh what would be called spirit people you know realms and things we can talk to one another we can imagine we can carry on conversations and and discuss things you know and and we can do all of that and we look at those things and we're actually thinking that that's real and don't don't forget now please don't you know that we are a unit right of body spirit and soul all right and we must have those to display ourselves and without any one of those we would not be alive or doing so don't don't lose that in the point that i'm trying to bring but we make i believe in ourselves we make our our body and our spirit realm to be more real than we do the the soul and then we just don't really know what the soul is and we just you know we just well i don't really know i guess it's the nature of the spirit you know and and all like that well all of those things are well and good no but the soul of the individual as i've tried for months and months now to express that is the part of you that lives on after death the body goes to the grave the spirit goes back to god who gave it you know but the soul has to go somewhere and abide so why don't we get down to realizing the reality of the soul of an individual and what makes the difference between the the the animal and the human being is the fact of the human being having a soul and and you know that makes us into the basis of of in god's image because it was in our body that was created in the image of god that's created an image of the animals but see we can look at something and we make the point that well that's real when there's something within the individual that is a whole lot more real you know than what we can see right as we look at the outside or we even look at manifestations and things of what we're doing you know there's something within us that's real and that's what i'm trying to deal with see and i was trying to express to you there wednesday that satan he cannot create now that's you know forget it brother brown said that we brought the quotes to you wednesday you know if you're going to believe brother brown and believe if not go and believe what you're going to believe anyway you know short time from now we're going to be worried about it but the way things is going you know and i'm praying lord bring it on quicker even though lord jesus come let's get out of here let's get on with this and what we got to do go by the grave or wind up in in glory one and get on with something because you know i'm just getting tired of just haphazardly floating along you know and going to church and things and i love to go to church but still you know that's not all of it but now see satan he cannot create the only creation he can do is create confusion he can't create he has nothing no ability to create and see he doesn't have a soul so he wouldn't be creating a soul in the image of his self because he doesn't have a soul to start with he's an angelic created being then and you know in doing that then what would he how would he create it but what he done we we've been talking about it and i preached this for 40 years to you that satan then he perverts the nature of your soul when that baby's born it comes into the world looking up and seeing and hearing the the loud vulgar languages and and seeing all of the things in the perversion of life because we're born in satan's domain amen and being born in this domain he perverts the nature of that soul that god gave you because the bible said all souls are mine you know what is ezekiel 18 4 souls are mine see all right then satan cannot do it but we want to give him more credit than what he's even do in life our thoughts see he can only pervert brother around said those fallen angels give you a nature we don't believe in pressing into it like you know they believe back there and becoming this and that and all but they just give you a nature because they come down and pervert you see the reason we need to be born again is because we were perverted into a way and like i told you and i believe it you know that god cannot create anything imperfect so when he created your spirit and your soul they were created perfect not eternal perfect amen all right because what could he create something from he can't create anything imperfect it's perfect but satan over time perverts the nature of that until we wind up then to be you know liars i mean the psalmist david he was smart he he you looked down at a little baby and he said with our ladies a liar well that's true but that's future tense baby can't lie all right but after a time comes it will start lying why because the nature of it has been of that soul of that individual now remember that see then the soul is what is the real part of us and that's where satan started to pervert through the head right right that's right because that was the only way he could do it brother around said satan started in the head he said god started in the heart all right so satan starts through the head to come down through in our memory reason conscious effect to pervert that nature and we wind up being as we've showed our in the in the book of ruth we wind up being uh to a point of where that we've actually got one closer ken and that's not just your body that's the whole individual why because it's perverted right and it can't come from god all right now we try to do that but as i said we try to make things more real but remember that soul will live on after death and it will have to be judged that's right now that's what we do here see we judge ourselves as being sinners and we accept jesus christ as our savior and in doing that then we don't have a judgment to come to decide eternal life or not there's a judgment that indeed's done in the body whether good or bad but that has nothing to do with eternal life right all right see but the soul that sentenced the scripture said that soul shall die or be destroyed the annihilated all right see then we got down to this part and that's where we want to pick up from see why you must be born again and what will take place in the new birth all right that's what i don't understand it i never have but that's all right people say brother dale is so deep and then i hear i dropped down so far until i'm talking on a level that we already understood 40 years ago you know to try to get people to see what the new birth really is what do you mean the new birth i come in a world eternal life i don't need no your birth well you're quoting brother branham but what about all the others right if one fights the other remember doesn't work right one contradictory the other one doesn't work right they have to fit right somewhere all right now we got down to the point wednesday night of talking about it see in the new birth god don't destroy your soul to give you a new birth that's right when it says in ezekiel and we haven't got to that yet we might use it this evening but we'll see when he said i give you a new heart and your spirit now that's not even that's not your soul he's talking about it right he said then i'll put my life within you there's the new birth so god begins in the heart whereas satan begin in the head but satan perverts through the head but god doesn't start to try to wash the head i gotta come in here in a minute i'll get to it when i get this point here satan doesn't try he tries he has to go through the head he can't go through your heart in his heart is soul now when i say heart you know i i mean soul all right now because it's not the thumping gizzard your heart the thumping music you know the thing that's pumping the blood throughout the body that's not your soul right that's a mechanical thing because if it is we would have more doctrines than two souls because you could have ten heart transplants they didn't try to chip and i'm sure they got two or three underway right so what would you be that's what people's worried about they're worried about going and getting a heart transplant because they think the heart is the soul and who saw what i have would i be me after i've got the heart transplant that heart is just a thumping gizzard all right if god don't start in your heart to try to do it that's only the that's just words of mankind he starts in the soul to dealing with that soul because that's where the new birth starts it doesn't start in your body it doesn't start your spirit it starts in the show right all right it's not an outward inward thing you know it's an inward outward he has to get inside to bring outward to something from the inside of us all right so then what do we do it's not your soul that died right well i got this quote here brother brother we'll go back to this policy and i put this on here because there's people you know hearing it and be the first time but make sure you check out what you're saying because brother branham until 62 was teaching basically now i said basically because there's a lot in there that he was he was using it in the right order and he knew what he's talking about right because he was the prophet and i'm in no way trying to correct he's trying to illustrate it all right the prophet basically used to teach that it was body soul second round spirit center realm then he comes along into 62 and it becomes into like brother claude was bringing out about that son of man coming into to the uh right um spear of the heavens and as it does then he begin to show it correctly because that would be hebrews 4 12 that the word of god would be the discerner to tell the difference between soul and spirit jordan marin divided now so then after 62 he would teach what body spirit second realm soul sinner but he never changed the senses he always gave five senses for the outsides he takes phil smell here he always gave five senses for the second realm whether he would call it soul or call it spirit he always gave the five sense of memory reason conscious effects and blood and stuff like he said there's only one sense or one thing in the soul he said it's either faith or doubt so you say well brother dale i have a lot of doubt well that's not in your soul if you're born again right that's one thing we should get a lot of those things settled that's right a born-again christian cannot sin from the soul amen you sin in your body and your spirit you can't see him from your soul because the bible said his seed reminded dennis and he cannot sin all right but see that way what we need is to not get a new soul we need to yield ourselves to god and we'll read this in a second and let god then just clean out right what's in there amen that he doesn't like right and that's where i like that scripture and a lot of people thinks it's incorrect but the scripture said that it's the the holy ghost and fire they think that scripture is turned around it's not i believe it correctly because that fire keeps burning there's a lot of burning from the inside coming out right it's not burning out of the soil right right amen but it starts burning outwardly and i love it that way because this out here is what's going to either get burnt or it's going to be changed in a moment the twinkle of an eye all right now so we got the choice we can do what we want to about it all right but see it wasn't your soul that died right it wasn't that it was the nature of it which was the nature of the world see then that way you're not looking for a new soul when the scripture says i'll give you a new spirit now does that literally mean out goes one in goes another right or what does it mean you know what does that mean i give you a new spirit remember i said you couldn't stand your own self with your old spirit but what does it mean it means it begins to do a work now justification listen doesn't mean giving you a new spirit second realm right second ring i told you know all right real whatever you want to call it you want to call it soul you want to call it spirit second realm doesn't deal with the fact of your spirit the center rim is the only one that can deal with the fact of the work would say i give you a new heart and a new spirit see justification works in the soul right not in the body right i'll get back to that in a minute you know you get ahead of your own doings but we'll get down to it but just think on these things what is the new birth well after all of these years you know we need to know all about this thing yes so did eve so did eve do you know what she messed up with well i know all about what the new birth is brother dale well then why is the devil keep living outside of us all right that's right amen i like the way brother biscuit says it said if you see a i think he was the one that said at that time he said if you see a fox tail sticking out of a foxhole he says it pretty well sure you've got a fox in that hole i like that you and i we live like the devil and it's a pretty good sign who we belong to so just forget it it's not your holiness it's his holiness all right but now let's get down to it see we're on these wednesdays and we just i wanted to come back to it to make sure we understand so look at your your notes on this is coming from souls in prison preached in 1963 uh 11 11 10 63 in the morning service so now watch what the prophet's talking about remember the soul remember now i'm talking about the center rim the prophet here is coming up and talking about the center realm of you the soul what you really are and he's expressing what happens to us in the new earth well all we need to do is just accept jesus christ and we're you know well that's well and good but how do you know to accept something that you don't know what you accept you know i mean somebody walk up and hands you a box today you better not grab it real quick it might have 10 million dollars written on the outside you know but it might be a bomb too you know so you don't just reach and grab you know i want to know what's in the box open it up let me look at it and that's the way i am in the gospel i like for it to go through the bible and see what it's saying about it and then that way that i can understand so look what your prophet had to say he taught my souls in prison now the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul and the soul is something that's the the nature of the spirit well that's exactly right our spirit is supposed to display the nature that is within us amen it does do it so then the the nature of the soul and the nature of the spirit is supposed to be the sun right right so then the souls of nature are spirit spirits in the nature of the soul so both quotes are identically correct right the way your prophet will be brained all right the soul is something that the the nature of the spirit and when the nature of a man when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us that we're dead and our lives are hidden in god through christ sealed there by the holy spirit now it says we're dead right you don't need an arguing with a dead man i've heard of people that would argue with a signpost but it doesn't do any good so you ain't gonna need an argument with a dead man all right now it wasn't that your body died listen it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit died amen i believe that now watch the nature which is the soul amen all right now watch the nature of your soul is is god if you're born again if it's not it's of the world now that don't need a big hammer on the head to understand a great revelation though that's as plain as can be the nature of your soul is god if you're born again if you're not then it begins to explain see the continual reading going on down anything that again has to end so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin and then your life did begin when you were born when god breathed the breath of life into your nostrils and you became a living soul then you begin then but when you that nature that was in you by nature you was of the world all right is that what i'm saying satan comes in perverts right alienated from god you're you were actually an animal right because animals don't like like humans right humans are worse than animals amen all right you were actually an animal that's right anyone knows that we're mammal how many knows that that were mammal we're a warm blooded animal but that is what we are by our earthly creation but you see what made us different from other mammals that at god put a soul upon us see now the other mammals don't have to wear clothes no other animal has to wear clothes to hide a shame but us we're the only ones that does because we have a soul but you see god in the beginning knew what a man would be like and he created the earth and brought up all kinds of animals from the very slowest to the highest and the highest animal came forth was man so when you see man walking down the street thinking he's somebody you know and got a little education and things you remember it's the clot of indiana dust that's all and that woman that's all dressed in shorts and smoking cigarettes and carrying on down the street twisting like she owned the whole country it's the clot of indiana dust and that's the way it's turning back so you're not very much to begin with so that that's right that's what you are but that soul that's in directory that soul is what god's working on amen all right now this is fine enough to show you what he's doing to get us born again all right so now let's see that went from seven um all of those are on seven this this one is on uh number two of your notes which is page eight the soldier in prison all right and it goes on down continue reading on this one see if he can only get that nature of that spirit to agree with him and that nature dies the nature and the love of the world dies right and the things of the world is dead because if you love the world or the things of the world the love of god is not in you and a man must be born again so this nature has to die and the nature of god comes in comes and lives in you and god is the only thing there is that never did begin or never can end all right so then page nine he goes on sign one souls in prison so therefore he partnership jew taking this man earthly and this eternal spirit and put it together and god reflects his self all right so now what is what is god working on the soul of the individual not on your body because that's what we were talking about that's reason i preached some the services on the preacher message you know that where i gave a quote from brother branham that you don't like the the commander you know that said what must we do to be saved and they didn't turn around and say well what you need do you need to go to church you need to quit this you need to start doing that you know see people ask you what you do to be saying we need to go you need you need to come to lula when you come to louis you're just as lost as you was before you got here now i like the way brother brown preaches and i tell you what brother neville had to have some gumption about him he had to be a born-again christian i just met shook man's hand one time heard him speak but you know brother brown will plainly say he said won't do you no good to come to branham tabernacle they're just as messed up as any words i mean that'd be like wait getting up here and saying you know her errand you know i'm getting up here and saying that there's no need to come into the lula because they're just as messed up here they are anywhere else then i don't you know what i do i say amen brother neville's sending over holly hey man anyway we'll see everybody thankful you know if you can get to church no that wasn't what it was you must be born again now getting to church is part of the rules and regulations maybe are the way they are but it's not just because you come to church you come here and you find out in a hurry that brother dale that believes that you must be born again that's why i preach the way i do and i don't preach on power and clothes and dresses and stuff like that like all these other preachers do because mine's preached in a way that you can't back out from it because if you're looking like the devil you are the devil if you're cutting your hair paint your face you're going out here and doing the slop of the world it's you're lost don't deceive yourself and nobody else because brother dale ain't deceived right i don't say nothing about things but i'm not blind either because there's no need of it i'm not talking to your body see nicodemus thought jesus was talking to his body right he said my body go back come back again another body what good would it do jesus wasn't speaking to his spiritual realm the spirit part of him sure he's having to talk through that because that's where your memory reason conscience was stuck on but he's speaking right down into the heart that's why them people as i told you that wednesday they would finally figure out this man was talking about us all these parables he's saying and we we winding up being the devil's children they finally figured it out but remember what i told you that it says there that jesus said you you can't see you can't understand right but then he stated again he said you can't enter right why because you come and sit down in church for a while you'll have a little understanding right but just remember what understanding does the bible says knowledge puffeth up you can have a little understanding but you ain't going to see the kingdom the way jesus talked about but you can have a little understanding so he makes your nicodemus didn't misunderstand him he said you're not going to enter it if you can't understand these things you're not going to enter the kingdom because to enter the kingdom would it would mean that he'd have to be born again now he didn't go through a long discourse to nicodemus the nicodemus you just wait around here because i've got to die i've got to do this i got to do that you know the conversation just broke off and nicodemus went back the same man he was still needing salvation right so we can go to church all of our life and still sit there and distribute this is lost that's right there's one thing about it when you get there you won't be able to say i didn't hear it that's right and you you said well i didn't hear sermons in order to quit doing where do you need sermons for that right oh that's well and good you mean i got to tell you what to wear i got to tell you how to act no i'm going to tell you how to be born again he'll take care of the rest that's what your evangelists and all of those people are for is to come through and stir us up and tell us about these different kinds right but my job is to get down there and deal in that soul that you can't deny what i'm saying to be the truth then i prove it by the prophet and i just put it right down so then you got to make your choice but just remember whatever i send it out there comes your first don't ever think wrong about that part listen sure we were born in sin born in satan's domain satan perverted the nature of our soul and made that to be a condition that god would have to destroy are you listening satan put us to a position until there was no choice man was doomed yes right there was no way we could be good enough the rich young ruler go back and read it and read what your prophet said he said i kept these from my youth and the bible said jesus loved him why because he knew he was looking at a good sincere honest person but that person will end up in hell right because the hell's going to be full of good people right right but now listen so jesus said you must be born again what would have happened if nicodemus had made it far enough to the upper room yeah so something cut him off somewhere kept him from being there right now brother adam said and you you deal with him he said nicodemus and good maya would be given eternal life you need that quote i'll be glad to find it he said nicodemus and gomez remember comedians said you'd be happily fighting against this we better leave it alone instead of god we'll fight against god if you're not then don't worry about it come to know anyway he said nicodemus and gemmae would be given eternal life for their stand on the gospel all right we'll see they won't be bright i'd like to be foolish virgin have to come up another way we're not trying to deal on this my brother told me one time that sam i'm just interested in going to heaven you know well i said there's many ways to get into heaven i'm interested in the way that god made the plan you know you can be a good person and if it's good enough maybe something that you do maybe it might merit you eternal life would you like to go to the grave you'll have to be standing to watch on judgment but just remember every soul that is not clean to sin will have to die right this is there's no arguing to point it's just a final statement but see in doing that then do you have to come up to the basis of understanding what is the new birth what does it consist of is it going to church is it being good what about nicodemus standing there that jesus couldn't put his finger and evidently the rich young ruler he couldn't bring out nothing against the man what about a man standing there like that ain't me and you ain't might not be a good word but that's the plan that i can say this year not me and you i don't think any of us in here would qualify no we were all born in this perversion but now listen so then what happens god begins to work on that soul that's right he doesn't destroy it he cleans it up he washes it out he sets it aside and they just will i believe that's right but believing is part of it we'll get back to that in a minute i got a couple of kind of like questionable points and i'll put it in right here because it's a good place you know just the question or point was like this can your soul sin without your mind now number one if you're born again your soul cannot sin it's sealed that's right okay but if you're not born again your soul is already seen that's right now it says can your soul sin without your mind now remember you are a unit of body spirit and soul it all got to work together as a unit but see think on these things see you as a christian cannot sin from the soul right so it's got to be in the body and spirit part of us that we do wrong which would be through the mind the brain uh now we won't get into it because that's not the point of what's being said but see to me when i say mind i mean soul when i'm preaching because paul said to let the mind that was in christ be in you he'll make you a new creature all right see that's not your brother that's not your head that's not your mind your brain that's your soul if the mind if the soul of god be in you by the new birth then you're sealed in all right but we won't go that far we're just carrying it through about a person so you can't display sin without your body right amen if sin to a christian is in his spirit he still has to have a body to display things right so it will be working back out through her brain now i'm talking about a christian now see a christian can't sing in the soul there's no way it's not sealed so a christian makes mistakes in body and spirit all right because that's where satan attempt to stay right he could get so much that he could talk to the lord jesus to try to get him to reason but he wouldn't listen see satan's avenue is through the brain the mind the brain actually the avenue see and that's the way he contacts us down through our spirit realm as i said a while ago see he has to enter through the the head of the brain the mind that way to come down into the individual all right but if you're born again don't worry about it you can't sin in the soul amen that's right but we display it with our body because that's where we can be tempted at right now see that's the point of that where we can be tempted all right now here it goes on this is just more of the same point does the soul dictate to your mind or your mind to the soul all right now the soul is supposed to be the controlling force of an individual whether they're lost or saved that is your controlling power is your soul now to a christian then the the only way that anybody can control your mind now listen what i'm saying because it's what i mean it says does the soul dictate to your mind or your mind to the soul if you're lost your soul dictates out through your spirit through your brain mind body and you go do what you are all right but see on a born-again christian the soul is pure all right now i'm just going to say the best way i can my soul tries to dictate through my spirit to my mind all right i said twice all right because a lot of times i reason it out the memory reason conscious gets in my way and i've already got it cut off that's why that we are sick and we need healing amen the bible says we're healed he said his word and healed us but before it can come in see that was what satan done in the garden if you go to uh greatest battle ever fall brother around said satan perverted the flus now he may call it soul there so watch what i'm saying he he may say soul and say it perverted the flus but remember what he's talking about what's the flush memory reason conscious affection love whatever the fire imagination see and he that's messed up right i don't understand how god ever saves us right that's my point how does god ever save an individual right heaven the only one says because he's god that's what we'll get back to in a minute if you can get that soul to stand still long enough you know or in other words if he can get us to just thinking on the word then he can come to the point but i want to get these out of the way so the soul then is supposed to dictate everything and to a center it does you didn't have any trouble when you was lost did you right i had no trouble with anything when i've lost i just done what i wanted to do but you see when you're born again that soil within you tries to dictate out but it has a carnal spirit and body to deal with because you're not born again in your body and your spirit right it's just cleansed and really it's not cleansed like we think cleansed because you can still think about what you used to do if it would be cleansed the way we want to make it clean i would like to have it i could never remember all the things i've done what about you whether how small or how big i would love to be to where that i could just quickly quit doing it you know but god don't do it that way that's right that's why it's free moral agency all the way so he's still but that's soul of that individual then would dictate to the mind all right because your mind can't dictate to the soul the controlling force is the soul the one who dictates outwardly trying to to do but everybody else don't want to say and see to a sinner it's just all the way but to a christian that soul can only dictate as much as we will let in us and that's why hearing the word is so important that coming down through our memory reason consciousness and staying with that word and even like we say and it's a good point satan gets to bother you start singing he gets to bother you start praying how to work on these spirit and body right and that's what the adoption that we'll get to more as we go on through the doing but i wrote it this way now the soul controls the spirit and that spirit is what works out through the mind or brain right see that's what i want right i wish i could get it to where i never had no dirty thoughts what about you you said brother dale you have dirty thoughts yes you do too don't come up and garbage can me i don't play with you because satan could if he could give jesus the wrong thoughts he can certainly give us a whole lot worse and you know if we never didn't do something we couldn't remember doing it right so it's our problem right now here's the last part then i'll get back on the other if you can control your mind would it control your soul you you'll never be able to control the mind we're talking about brain now right right mind brain you can't control your brain there's no way the only way that can ever be done is let the inside control there's no way see that's what we've tried to make is christians out of people dress right do right do go to church do this and they'll we've tried to make christians in our brain situation and reasoning memory and consciousness now you know your mother's in heaven you don't want to go to heaven with her you know this is our new you see and we try to make christians out of people through a mental concept instead of a born-again experience from the heart like i told you i never got up when i was a sinner and said well i don't know whether i'm gonna go out and live for the devil today or not did you you know i'm making illustration but then we get up on sunday morning so we'll you know i don't feel too good we going church today i've never done that in the baptist i mean i never had that in a badness there was never a discussion in our family where we was going to church or not sickness or non-sickness there was never a question about that it was all ready to settle nobody comes to my house on sunday because they know they ain't going they're not nobody's right i mean they're welcome to come i'll give them the key they can cook we never want to get back and i'll eat with them but my family don't call up and we're coming off your house sunday they they never have went out of the badgers they didn't do it that's right see what i'm trying to tell you is my brain at least when i was even lost my brain didn't control me that way i could control it to the degree so there was something inside of me wanting to go to church and i've expressed to you about it even if you're lost that soul of that individual wants to worship its master even if you're lost that's right that's why you you worship total poles and things but you understand what the point see i wrote it this way the only way you can control the mind is by whatever is in the soul whatever's in the soul will control eventually has to and i'm like this now folks i'm as honest as can be i don't look at things like seemingly a lot of people look at it and i've watched them walk into death thinking these things because the way i see a lot of preachers preach they preach it like that i'm right here now this is the way i understand all right that i'm right here and i take another step and i get a little better i take another step and i get a little better i take another step the devil ain't bothering me as much as he used to right now i'm just honest you can believe that if you want to i've always said the rapture to me is taking one more step in the word you keep walking in the word as you do yes satan has less control of you yes but it will not through the opening of the word will not take away the fact that satan can still enter through our brain our human parts of us and try to get us to reason right because we did why would god have to die i'll get to that more this afternoon what would he have to die what's the purpose if we could do it on our own if we could control the mind and the spirit why would god have to die nicodemus had it nicodemus had probably better control i'm just as honest as can be now you can make what you want to out of me i just i preach like i am nicodemus probably had more control of his body and spirit than i have of mine and you have a humor i don't mind saying that and won't back up i don't like you talking about me like that well okay do something about it you know right see i'm just honest because anointed ones they where are they anointed the spirit realm right what is that memory reason cause it's effects is manchester nation and they have a great love a great atmosphere about them what's that word charismatic every way you say it you know they're all into love and and doing and giving and going and doing and right and now that's right but that don't make them christians that's right that's right he said well let's go out there try to get done the internet's open man it came to measure for putting some tile down you know i just i don't talk a lot about a lot of things but i just he said something to me and i said well we're on the internet anytime you want it spoken wordchurch.com connect on he said well you know what i don't i said you can get it live about one day later because we're live now and it's working good you know but uh i said mondays you can connect home and you can view what goes on at the church he said i don't have nothing to do a lot of times on monday well all right you say well you don't do much witnessing well maybe he might maybe that's my way of witnessing see out there because i found out i can't do much i'm not the preacher to this you know that everybody thinks i'm just me but you got it the soul is a controlled power of man and then out from that control tower we'll start the control of man and the more we feed the man inside the more control we will have outside all right that's right because like i said you get down and out start singing you know that works with the brain you know it works in the spirit realm right you know after a while the brother said they asked her they said to him said run around you said he said yeah did you live so close to god to the devil don't know what to do with you now brother brown you live perfectly no right run around you sin he said every day now what's he talking about right we ought to come to the place that our walk should be that we want the word to be revealed to curious right because it can only be from the inside all right man we got that see i just put that part in there because see then you know what i believe about it you know what i believe about the new birth because you heard me over and over and over but brother branham what is the new birth christ the mystery of god revealed number four in your notes what is the new birth then you say well brother branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen now he is not talking about head knowledge right head knowledge is not a revelation according to the bible hebrews 11 1 i believe it is isn't it faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen faith is a revelation page 14 of um i'll get it in a minute rapture yeah i believe that's right rapture all right but now listen see it's christ in you it's what the church is to be built on is what a revelation of jesus christ now as we were saying about the soul it's not the body that the body don't die right the spirit don't die the soul don't die in the new birth you say well you just read where it dies you yeah we die to ourselves did not die like god we've got to die to ourselves when the scripture says that we're dead right that don't mean that we're in the undertaker's parlor right what does it mean god comes in and it's not that you die that would be god living that wouldn't be you that's right you know how to preach that god if we read while ago shoulder breath he partnerships you right right right he comes in and he gives you eternal life he gives eternal life to your soul right then your soul is your theophany why because god has brought it to you right right amen all right that's it my brother richard says wilson see that up the statue of a perfect man you're hearing from you theophany right through the reveal word that's right and it's carrying you greater and greater you see then god comes in and gives eternal life now he puts that's why i told the two soul people i said you missed it all the way around i said if i was gonna ever preach two souls i'd preach it after you born again right sure yep see they preached two souls four years morning and i said i appreciate you born again because you know what god's got to come in your soul and live to give you eternal life he just doesn't come in an anointed right that's right the baptism of the holy ghost is on anointed ones right that don't give eternal life to the soul just cause you're anointed with the spirit of god doesn't give you eternal life right that's right but when the soul of god contacts your soul it makes your soul eternal and it puts you and god together as persons living within you and the more we let him live the better off we are you don't ever do two souls that be the point to me but that won't work see they didn't like that idea all right see i don't believe in two souls and it wouldn't be what would it be it's your soul mate eternal all right yes we'll get to it i'm going to get it when we finish it this evening but around them according to the future home tells you exactly what happened that's right he tells you exactly what happens in the new birth that anointing on your spirit doesn't give you the new birth right but the word that you've taken the disciples took the word the scripture said held it they've been with the word for three and a half years that was the only thing that could drive that unclean spirit out of them and they could come up to the bases that they could be born again was the hearing that word and then what happened on death pentecost that word that they heard was made alive that's exactly what the new birth is in your soul that word you've taken in your soul and held on to look what david would have been if the holy ghost would have been there all right amen he said thy word have i hid in my heart that's what god loved about david david loved god's word that's right you don't love god's word you have to love god david had an honor and a church for that word that's right what if he had the holy ghost to follow him it would have been a great thing with brother bradham what is a new word it's a revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen that's why in the kingdom of god in the new testament it is not to a group of people it is to an individual that makes up a group then the body of christ see it's not whether mama say daddy's saved kids are saved who's saying it's whether or not you're saved right i like what joshua said for me and my house me first in my house we'll serve the lord well now me and my house is here i know what it means my home my family i know what that means that goes with it but for me and my house right we're going to serve the lord if my family don't serve the lord so i'm going to put it down in the right order all right now once but ryan said you say you're this you're that you're a lutheran that's bad that's what he snaps his fingers it's not even snappy finger right what is it is christ revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself right what is the new birth the birth of the word and we'll get to it and i know this afternoon when i take this home but we'll get to it this evening that word that you hear the gary and i talk about me and you it took two years in me wanted brother gary for that word to drive that unclean spirit out all right now you tell me that it wasn't the word that jesus used against the unclean spirit that's right he never argued with him and flesh with him his temptation he didn't argue with the devil right he said it is written all right amen you never flush with nobody right see all i've ever tried to do is plant seed of the word all right amen right around said david had the word but he said he knocked the spirit of god to make it alive that's right what is it then that's christ's idea that's god's idea the new birth reveals this and if a man says he's born again and try to place these promises of christ in this last day to some other age making him christ yesterday but not today then that man or that person has been in a delusion by satan that's right what is the new verse brother christ revealed in you amen so it's christ expressing himself in the end in the individual whether he's intellectual or whether he don't know his abc's he goes on and explains the disciples didn't have any education right then what is the lies the new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's the new verb first the mystery is you must be born again all right next is the threefold mystery that will carry you all the way to the chains of the body it's all a revelation all right one more thing look over and i put it 4a which is patma's vision you know what that one is but around preaching in 1960 1204 evening service patmos vision he said now ask god to while we're talking on revelation ask him to give you a revelation of this for it can only be known by revelation and you can only be saved by revelation you have a knowledge of it intellectually but you can't be saved until it's revealed amen no man can call jesus the christ only by the holy ghost and you know what your prophet said no man can call jesus the christ without a personal experience of the new birth my nicodemus couldn't understand it it would take a personal experience what what about nicodemus standing there with all that word and the great life he was living he wouldn't even like david david was a murderer or a whoremonger he didn't ever playing the garbage can what about a man standing there not a mark against him and that word we need that new birth right the new birth is a revelation of jesus christ personally to you he said what was your experience brother dale i've told it over many times and remote would say brother dale i don't know what you're seeking i said i don't either because i don't even know anything about them trying to see but i'm not satisfied right one day in athens georgia he just looked right down at me and he said because he done told me before he said you quit seeking anything whatsoever i said i'm not doing it he said you accept jesus christ right he said because he is a person right and he's the person of the word amen right that was it that settled my whole experience of everything when christ began to deal with me personally i had seen many things been doing things sure read been in the message for two years but still i wouldn't like the people of this message say well i had to i had to have a new birthday i couldn't have come to the message now judas is carrick followed it a long time got a lot of things in there you know but you know that you're not gonna you're not gonna convince people you know why because they won't do as brother ronald said on souls in prison he said if he can get that soul to just stand still long enough you know what stand still means no no them disciples it took them three years and a half to learn what standing still was and you know what it was put up a room whereas i told you it's jesus a scene of over 500 brethren it says but 380 didn't make it to the upper room but 120 took the word and went up and said i am the new birth is the birth of the word amen now you can have all the words start out not having your birth because if they had it but now it couldn't come on him because jesus had died but we're in a different situation so don't play nicodemus you know well i'm just like nicodemus no we're not like nicodemus we're in a different age different time it's here amen if you want the holy ghost accept it well brother dale i haven't said that well keep accepting until it accepts you he says not whether you accepted him officers whether he accepted you but you know what he's dealing with we can fool even ourselves amen that's right we can make ourselves so hootie duty and religious and everything in the world i paved the parking lot you may want to pay the 12 000 it went we can't guarantee you eternal life but we will write you a receipt you can take off the income tax that's not being funny it's serious i was serious then and i just i saw that i've watched it all my life about people and what they've tried to do to save yourselves there's not one thing you can do to save yourself but if it was why did jesus die all we gotta do is accept him i've got a revelation all right you can have a revelation the little woman had a revelation that she touched him this garment i never gave her the new birth i've been through that with you there were plenty of people come to jesus that had a revelation was healed and all kind of that never gave him eternal life right amen that's right i believe everything brought around said amen but as paul said have you received the gift of the holy ghost since you believe yes that's right amen never stop seeking god until you find him and then when you do you'll never stop seeking him the second will be greater after you're born again than it was before that's right come on brother think on these things what is the new word the birth of the word amen the words you've taken what is the eternal life god's own life now listen listen now for a second please because i had a part was going to miss it and i've come back to it see we think that the new birth is like that the soul and eternal life just and forgive me for using the word it just zaps it is that what you think the new birth is is that what you think i'm talking about like your soul is like this bible i'm holding and that's your soul and then god just zaps it no his own life comes in you soul to soul his own life comes into you that's right it's not just him giving eternal life to the soul the soul is made eternal by his presence his presence coming and living in you think on these things 5 39. let's stand together anybody have a need god brothers unto me inside of you no matter how sinful they are that you can't see their sin you've never had an experience until you do that stop condemning you've ever had an experience of standing safe person inside of there coming out you never experienced something like that you don't know what to do we need to stand say and let that one inside of you say you're healed then there's no problem about the healing there's no problem about the salvation for your family your children we love them and we want to do everything we can to try to save our children right amen and we do that but living reform is the greatest of all alive before them in christ but if it's ever been quicker than you might die and the lord tell you something then you know what a revelation then he went around and said i don't care if the world he said if god told me to go right george washington he said i'd invite the world to go pray until that inward man is oh me the joy of thy salvation within me within me within me out of the way from memphis the joy of my salvation and renew my spirit within me
