TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's get started um let's turn to matthew 1. and read through a few verses just to kind of set the context uh because we've been going down through the uh the genealogy of um of the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham and um kind of going through the story of the birthright and uh the promises of abraham that and the story of how they're uh what i'm going is where how the birthright was given to joseph and ephraim and the the promise of the messiah went through judah and how that all came about so let's just read a few verses just to set the context the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham abraham began isaac and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat judas and his brethren and judas beget ferez and zara of tamar and forest we get israel and israel israel to get around and everyone began i mean adam and eve that we're getting their song and their song to get summoned and you know i was researching uh just looking at how to pronounce some of these names and each of us have our own little uh you know we've heard the pronunciation all our lives but come to find out we pronounce a lot of these names wrong so like levi the chronic the correct pronunciation for levi is actually libby and um the if you see a j at the beginning like jehovah gyra is pronounced instead of jehovah gyra so um don't get too hung up on the pronunciation if i mispronounce something wrong this you'll never know besides you do such a fabulous job bless your heart so let's turn to oh revelation last time we talked about um that we were kind of talking about the different components of the birthright leading up to how it was the sector was given to judah and the birthright was given to joseph what part of the birthright was given or what what constituted that what was what was given to joseph and uh what was given to judah so um we kind of were talking about how the birthright spoke of a kingdom of kings greece um and a multitude of nations and uh so now we're going to talk about the how it's part part of the the promise is that we will become if you're part of that kingdom you're priests so let's turn to revelations 20 verse 6. and that says blessed and holy is he that have part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and to reign with him a thousand years so we have a promise that if we're part of this spiritual kingdom that the messiah came to set up that we will be part of the promises that will be priests of god there's other scriptures that says we'll be uh king there will be kings and we talked about that last time how the promises that would be kings how we have um dominion over over the world the flesh and the devil and um and so part of the promise is that is the promise that will be priests and this there's a lot of disagreement about if you look at what like for example the mormon church says that the the priesthood was not part of the birthright but scofield's notes on genesis 25 31 talking about esau selling his birthright says that the part of the birthright was the pre-aaronic priesthood so before the before uh the firstborn was taken we will look we'll go through the history for in a second of the how the levitical priesthood came to be but you'll remember that the firstborn was chosen by god and then god took the levites instead of the firstborn to serve him in the temple and before that the firstborn was the priest of their family and so i kind of just had some notes from clark's commentary on the bible agrees with this jameson faucet brown bible commentary there was a medieval jewish commentary named rashi that was very popular that um says that the priesthood that the jews rely heavily on that the priesthood of the family was part of the birthright and jews to this day it holds strongly that the priesthood was part of the birth of the priesthood of the family was part of the birthright um so and and just looking at the promises in revelation speaks of um that will that will we are priests of god and of christ and brother ram and israel in the church he said the father was the priest of the house and the old sanctuary the old time the father always was the priest and he had to watch over his household would have changed today the kids watched over the dead in the modern world but the father was to watch up his house he killed the lamb he took the hyssop put it on the doors on a little and that was their protection all right they stayed in i can see the rest of them going frolicking and carrying on saying look at that bunch of fanatics oh with an old sheep blood on the door trying to say this hooker's pocket something's going to happen but it did why god said so it always is the truth when god says sir and then god's provided a way he said these uh still talking about putting the blood over the little of the door and there that night out and let's take a little drama i can notice the father of course and the old testament was the priest of the house now he's the figurehead now he goes down and he puts on the door and the little post and then when it comes about night i can see all the young girls down there come out tell the hebrew girls come on we're going out to dance why they say we can't go we're under the blood what a type we're coming in god's provided way and god's provided way in 1953 he said i can hear the priest of the family the father said there's the death angel sweeping the land now too late now and directly i can see him go dip down on into a valley here scream come up from that house the sun was dead away he went directly here he comes right down to another house again goes in the big black wings close in around the house a scream goes up comes up the sun is dead i can hit a little boy say daddy take another look be sure the blood's on there yes sir so you can see how that that so many so many types there now that the father the the man of the family is supposed to be the priest and and if we're part of the kingdom we're supposed to be we offer up just like the priests in the temple offered up incense before god we offer up our prayers and our thanksgiving our songs um so a history of the how the levitical priesthood started um in exodus 13 2 and i'll just read it off for you quickly uh god says sanctifying to me all the first born whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel both a man and a beast that is mine and we could go into how the firstborn had to be had to be redeemed by uh he talked about the firstborn mule had to be redeemed by a lamb and the firstborn is must be redeemed just like we have to be redeemed by christ and then so the firstborn was taken by god and then god later on he said in exodus 13 12 17 thou shalt that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the matrix and every first lane that cometh of a beast which thou hast the male shall be the lords and every first thing of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength of hand the lord brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage and it came to pass when favor would hardly let us go that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both the first one of man and the firstborn of beast therefore i sacrificed to the lord all that openeth the matrix being males but all the firstborn of my children are redeemed and there shall be a token upon thy hand for frontless between our eyes for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth out of egypt and then in exodus 32 26-29 uh this is when moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who was on the lord's side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gather themselves together unto him and he said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel put every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the canvas lay every man his brother and his companion and every man his neighbor and the children of levi i did according to the word of moses and their fellow the people that date about 3 000 men so because of what they did and they were separated they stood by when god said who's on the lord's side the levite all of levi stood with the lord and so they were separated to serve the lord in the temple and instead of the first one of every family in numbers 3 12 13 and i behold i have taken the levites from among the children of israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of israel therefore the levi shall be mine because of the firstborn of mine from the day that i smoked all the firstborn and the land of egypt i hallowed unto me all the firstborn in israel both man and beast to mind shall they be i am the lord in revelation 1 6 it says and have made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever so last time we talked about how the birthright the spiritual birthright is the is the new birth so being kings and priests is part of being part of this new kingdom and the revelation of jesus christ he said and made us priests yes priests unto him offering the spiritual praise of sanctified lips spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning priests and kings unto our god when faith is the substance he said our bodies are groaning and we have an inheritance and we're children now heirs of the kingdom of my kings and priests unto god offering spiritual sacrifices what does a priest do to make a sacrifice what is a spiritual sacrifice that's what these sons and daughters do which are kings and priests yet not in full possession but they're making sacrifices offering to god spiritual sacrifices the fruits of our lips giving praise to him fruits of our lips you say brother branham i just don't feel like praising him that's the time to make the sacrifice praise him anyhow kings and priests sons and daughters offering spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our lips giving praise unto his name in the end time evangelism 1962 he said feed us with that hidden manner that you said in the bible was given that laid back just for the priesthood only and we are taught that we are priests of god offering spiritual sacrifice that is the fruits of our lips giving praise to his to his name now we pray that you will bless us in the further part of this service breaking the bread of life to us so you can see how that the priests offered sacrifice and they could partake of the um the the manna and the cakes that were reserved just for the priests let's see another thing i like this in the in the old in the in solomon's temple there was a in the outer court it was a set of steps that led up into the inner court and the priests part of what they did was they had a choir and they would line up along that the steps and seeing as you went into the uh the the intercourse and um let's see in first chronicles 5 12 14 it talks about it and also the levites which were the singers all of them of asaph of him and the jedison with their sons and their brethren being arrayed in white linen having symbols and salters and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them in 120 priests sounding with trumpets it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard and praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments and of music and praise the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the lord and uh i was reading where josephus talked about how uh the the old writings that he had read of people that had went into the into solomon's temple said it was just so awe-inspiring to come in and see the stingers all all dressed in their priestly garments and uh just such a holy atmosphere and that's the same kind of holy atmosphere that we should create in our worship just like those priests did so that's the that's kind of an overview of the priesthood and uh think of this in the context of the generations of jesus christ and how the um how this fits into the promise and uh the next part is uh the promise of many nations and after after i kind of go into this overview of where we're going we'll dive into uh last time we talked about abraham we'll start looking at isaac and then look at how the uh look at the promises that that jacob the blessings of jacob upon each of the 12 sons and how that how they were placed according to their promise so the promise of many nations was uh one of the the blessing that jacob gave to ephraim was that he would be a multitude of nations so when you think of the birthright think of the um the birthright that was promised to ephraim think about this this promise of a multitude of nations uh judah was gonna bring the messiah but uh ephraim through through joseph and ephraim was to come a multitude of nations um and let's see let's go to let's look at genesis chapter 17. but there's a natural multitude of nations and a spiritual multitude of nations so we kind of looked at both of those 17 verses 5 and 6. this is god's promise when he changes his name from abram to abraham verse 5 neither shall thy name anymore be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee and i will make the exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and king shall come out of thee so now let's go to god's promise to jacob in genesis 35 reverse a little start at verse 10 and god said unto him thy name is jacob thy name shall not be called anymore jacob but israel shall be thy name and he called his name israel now he's going to reiterate his promise to abraham when he changed abraham's name and god said unto him i am god almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and king shall come out of thy lords and it goes on to talk about the promises of the land until i see that it would be the land and and so forth but um so think about this in the context of where joseph's birthright and then uh let's go to genesis 48 jacob's blessing to ephraim so remember god promised jacob that he would give him a nation he'd be the father of a nation and a company of nations the nation of judah and a company of nations of israel genesis 48 19. this is when jacob was blessing joseph's son and saying they're going to be part of my inheritance they're going to be named by my name and and uh and let's start at verse 18 and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is the firstborn because joseph crossed his hands and uh put that right hand upon his head and his father refused and said i know it my son i know it he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations that's his promise to ephraim a multitude of nations so in the natural after 25 years jacob goes down to egypt with 70 just 70 souls and 210 years later it came out with um in exodus 12 37 it says they they came out with 600 000 on foot that were men besides children so if you extrapolate a lot of people have tried to figure out how many total people there were based on that and the estimate is between 1.5 and 3.5 meat if you say to all the men six hundred thousand between the age of 20 and 60 you kind of figure out that with all the children and women and and old older people then uh the total number is going to be a huge amount of people a multitude of nations and so in the spiritual abraham is also the father of many nations let's go to romans 4 16. hmm started uh let's just start at verse 13. for the promise that he should be the heir of the world is not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of no effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed leaving god and quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall i see be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now did when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb um so by faith we can be part of many nations that come together in christ and uh i've got some more scripture let's see mark 13 10 says before before the end can come the gospel must first be published among all nations that's one of the requirements and in mark 16 15-16 said and he said unto them go thee into all to preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and uh in psalms 67 to the chief musician on negan of psalm or song god be merciful and us and bless bless us and cause his face to shine upon us that thou may be known upon earth by saving health among all nations so we can stand with the natural seed and say we have abraham to our father by faith and the seven compound names of jehovah 1955 around said now abra abraham received a promise from god as to be the heir to him would come a son and through the seed his seed would be heir to the world and through abraham's son which was isaac through isaac come jesus and jesus crawled in and she'd been the gentile and which forgive all nations the white man the brown man the yellow man the black man all people back redeemed back showing that this was the last age in galatians 3 8 i'll just read it and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying and thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham and revelation 7 9 and after this i be held in a great multitude which no man can number of just one nation just the israelites just the jews of all nations kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands and the ten virgins and the hundred and forty four thousand in nineteen sixty uh said uh what does your wife do she serves you in the house so you sit down she gives you your food she fixes the clothing see she serves you day and night in the house see and this one these of all nations the gentiles which is the bride are before the throne of god with him day and night i'll remember what we said last night and talked to him and a deceived church by the world 1959 he said one of the worst things it done let me start back a little bit and that's the way it is with the church when the church followed irreverently and daily after the leading of the holy spirit god blessed them in miracles and signs and wonders follow the church but when it began to keep bad company with the world one of the worst things had done when the first things had done it began to organize breaking up fellowship amongst other believers because they found out that nations were organized but this great gospel is not dedicated to one nation or one people it is dedicated to whosoever will let him come all nations kindreds tongues and people god never did intend for us to draw a boundary line and uh let's see in paragraph 39 of that same message now the first three chapters of revelation deals with the church the gentile jewish ethiopian afrikaans every type of people in the world goes to the gentiles to make up this body black white brown everything it's a bouquet of flowers and that's right that god puts on his offer and it's made up of all nations kindreds tongues and people um before we get into isaac i i hope that kind of sets the stage of where the birthright the the difference between the promise to joseph and to ephraim and the promise of judah which was to bring the messiah and there's a there's a natural and a spiritual a spiritual uh multitude of nations to uh to joseph's lineage to bring forth a natural multitude and we'll talk about this more next time but um next we're going to go into isaac and i see how the birthright promises were magnified through isaac jacob and then uh how jacob's blessing to each of his uh to each of the uh 12 sons places them positionally and then we'll look at judah the how the center goes to judah and the birthright blessing to joseph and ephraim and just keep on going down and look look through the genealogy of jesus and see who's missing in matthew and who's there and i think this will be fun so that's we'll stop right there
