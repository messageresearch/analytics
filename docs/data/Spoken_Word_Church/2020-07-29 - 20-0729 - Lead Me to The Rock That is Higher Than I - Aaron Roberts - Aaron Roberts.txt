many that are facing a lot of difficult times but i'm so glad that we got one that we can trust den and he takes care of all our issues all our problems all our needs all our troubles okay let's kind of think what i'm gonna speak about tonight and uh we're gonna go to uh psalms chapter 61 and then we're gonna go to first corinthians chapter 10. and they'll just pray for me tonight i uh you know sometimes you just got to wait on the lord you just you just make yourself available and wait for him to speak to you and uh so i've just been waiting on and uh i got up early early this morning before i went to work and uh started working on some of this so you know it's work in progress so uh y'all just pray for me and uh i got out of the truck and uh i had to i had my uh face mask right beside me got out of the truck walked in the door right there and didn't have it with me and i had to run it back so but anyway uh i had just lit my mind just so yeah um admitting my faults my wrongs so i apologize but i'm just just trying to hear it just trying to get her here tonight just rushing trying to just don't breathe when you walk out well i got my mask right here that's what i said i went back and got it see i have it i said that's what i said i had to go back out the door to get it i'm sorry hey let me give you another mama's bottles are good but they're still taking their food amen amen prayers the lord well just continue to pray for a lot of the other ones or and it seems like every day there's there's more believers that that uh keep contacting and posting that they are testing positive so a lot of them are really facing a lot of uh of these symptoms and uh especially you know it's a lot harder on the older ones and also some friends of mine you know it it's one thing for me when i was working and they cut our hours i got unemployment i got money from the federal government but if you are like i guess brother tony some of them that are self-employed but gary you know it's hard and i i've had some i've got a i got a friend and some other ones but i got one friend that lives in alabama and he's he's really struggled with this the last little while i'm trying to fight with the department of labor trying to get money because it's like hey it's not my fault you know and uh and especially you know he was able to get some money through a loan but then they're supposed to have loan forgiveness well uh it's really easy when they loan you money to forget what the terms are and and i was like you owe us money it's like no there's you got to follow the black and white here but so he's uh and then you call the department of labor and then uh they play elevator music for you and just please hold please hope he's over and so you can stay on hold till tomorrow and so y'all well let's just remember the different ones that are that are really struggling you know i mean it was hard on some people but it's still hard on others and you know the lord take care of his own and you know i mean not just message believers but i mean people that are real christian people that are trying to you know sincere and try to live for the lord and uh you know y'all just y'all just remember them because you know i think about it every day the lord blessed me i was able to have money and our bills got paid and everything but i don't know what it was like to you know if you're if you've got two incomes and all of a sudden you lose one and you know your wife his wife's work and trying to pay for everything and it just makes it hard trying to take care of the kids and everything so let's just remember all of them and but you know the lord knows all our needs before we ask but you know he said he said for us to ask he asked that your joy might be full and so you know it's a pleasure to ask him because he wants us to all right amen so before we read the scripture or not let's uh let's just all speak to the author and i know we speak to him but you know what brother brown said we can't pray enough you know we talk to a lot of people and we run our mouths and we have the gift of gab but there's one thing we can't do is talk to the lord amen so let's just all speak to the father to see heavenly father we thank you for this time lord together in your house lord lord you said where two or three are gathered in your name lord you'd be there in the midst lord we're just here a few in number here and but lord we gather in you lord we don't gather in a building lord but we gather in you and lord for those that are at home or whoever they may be that are listening in tonight lord jesus i pray lord that we all gather in you tonight lord in the holy spirit lord you come and speak lord lord distance isn't a isn't a problem lord the distance doesn't matter lord because the holy spirit can come into any bedroom any living room any kitchen wherever they may be at lord and you speak to them tonight lord lord lord just give us what we have need of tonight lord just help me get out of the way anoint me to speak tonight lord jesus lord as just a willing vessel to stand here lord and let you use me tonight lord and for each one that that's listening in lord i pray that you just touch their ears anoint them lord lord just all of the cares of the day father would just pass by and lord we just be one in you that you can speak to each one father for each one that's sick and afflicted lord you know each heart each one lord they're so numerous we can't remember them all over but lord there's not a single time lord when i don't get a text or a message from somebody lord i want to be so sincere to stop and pray for them lord the lord did not just let it slip by but lord take the time lord to intercede for them lord when you speak to people lord and they've lost loved ones to this virus and lord you see heartbroken people lord i pray that you'll be a comfort to them and lord for all those that are sick and lord those that are afraid lord even kids that are that are seeing the ravaging the effects of this disease lord and many of them lord some of them are are scared and they get nervous about things lord but i pray that you'll be a comfort to them lord just calm them lord just speak to each little young heart lord that we pray for the blood of jesus christ to be upon them lord or just touch them and lord we just pray that you come speak in a special way tonight lord anoint the words lord give me what i what i should say lord and lord just help me get out of the way lord that i can be a vessel for you to speak and lord we just we just want to hear from heaven tonight lord as we gather in lord give us something for the journey lord help us that we can just be closer to you or draw closer to you be a better soldier in this fight lord we thank you for it and we ask it all in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen psalm 61 and uh tonight i will look at lead me to the rock that is higher than uh i i got this i've been i've been thinking of of something and i couldn't really put it together into any anything but uh you know we went and seen uh we went to kentucky and and seen abraham lincoln's birthplace and everything then we went to springfield illinois where he grew up and and you know there's a lot of things about lincoln's life that's uh just really fascinating and it's just a real testimony of jesus christ and you know there was just some other things that happened just kind of dovetailing this morning i just had a little thought i wanted to speak on tonight so y'all just pray for me it says hear my cry oh lord attend unto my prayer from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i for thou hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy i will abide in thy tabernacle forever i will trust in the covert of thy wings see life and then we go to first corinthians chapter 10 is the next reading and it says moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all pass through the sea and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did eat and all eat the same spiritual meat and did drink all the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the end to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happened unto them for our examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore letter let him that think as he standeth take heed lest he fall there hath no temptation taking you but such is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to to bear it amen god bless you tonight be seated and i uh think of them you know we have a have a rock and david's speaking of he said when my heart is overwhelmed he said lead me to the rock that is higher than i and you know we're living in a time where a lot of people are overwhelmed with a lot of things and you know you you see that you see the condition that the world is in today and and you know you you can't you can't play with god and you can't play in in this area because you know now this is this is the time of manifesting and this is the time where it's going to be made known and you know this is the hour you've got to have the goods you've got you've got to have you've got to have the life you've got to have you've got to have the holy ghost because you just can't play with in this in this hour because you know there's many people that you see and you know i was thinking about as brother ernie villanueva always says we're living in a ripley's believe it or not world because we we live in such a time that is so mind-boggling to see the condition that the world is in and to see what what people have done and what people consider normal and and you know we see all these things that are taking place today and you know you you need to know where you stand you've got to have the play you know where you've got to where you need to be and you know because hearing and paul's speaking to the corinthians and he's and he's speaking to these things and and he says brothers i don't want you to be ignorant of this because he said you know some of them understood these things they they knew that they knew the history they knew what took place but he said i want to drill down on something i want you to have emphasis on this he said because he said i want you ignorant of this he said because well they all they all knew that moses god called moses to to lead the children of israel and they had a pillar of fire at night in a cloud by day but you know and he said but he said i want you to see this he said all of these that walked with moses he said they walked through with moses moses led them through and they had all these things and he said he said they ate of this spiritual meat and he said they drank of this rock he said they had this rock that followed them through the wilderness and he said and that rock was christ and he said i want you to understand he said christ was with them the whole time it was grace to them that there was a there was a pillar of fire there was a prophet in their day and all these things that they took place he said it was grace to them but he said they didn't pay attention to that and he said and all this and he said and look he said they went all those all these things that god done for them and leading them the whole way and he said but look he said but god was not well pleased with them why because they didn't have faith in what and what he's and what he said and what he was doing for them and you know brother brennam uh in in the message uh spiritual do uh spiritual food and due season you know brother brennan when he's when he begins to speak here he says he said i want you to to get built up in this he said in the holy oracles of god and the faith the faith of this hour the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this for this has to be rapturing faith to be taken up and he said we won't we want to want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen heard the word that you have heard preached the signs and wonders that you have seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether it be of god or not so they brought it up but uh when you when you speak he's speaking of having faith and you know paul's speaking he said they didn't have faith but all these things that they done he said this was for our example here they were being led and being by a promised word to a promised place a promised destination that god had told them told their forefathers years before told abraham and all the different ones that here they are they're going to be brought through all these things and yet they did not have faith to believe what was going to take place and all the times that god met their needs when they didn't have food he fed them when they didn't have water he he gave them water he gave them everything that they have needed no there wasn't a feeble one among them and and all the things that took place that god had done for them and yet they didn't have faith to believe what god was going to do for them and all the things that god had done and led them through they didn't see it and then and then he begins to tell us you know not to be idolaters or commit fornication or temp god all these different things that people can do he said don't do any of these things because you see what they've done in the past god doesn't want us to fall fall victim to all these things but he said he wants us to have faith in what he's done because it's a finished work at calvary but god wants us to believe in that and walk in that amen we need to we need to and brother branham said one time he was he was speaking he said he said it's time for us to go to the rock go to that the rock is christ he said he said because david was saying he said when i'm overwhelmed he said there's one place for me to go he said is go to the rock he said because thou has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy he said they know what god had done for him and it was a place for him to go to and there's a place for you and i to go to and that's in the rock of jesus christ [Music] the jesus that rock is a revelation of jesus christ and god wants to reveal himself to you in a in a personal way greater than you have today you think well you know i have a i have a revelation god has spoke to me i know what god has revealed to me but you know what there is a greater a greater revelation that god has for you a higher place than than you are today he said lead me to that rock that revelation that is higher than i am right now because there is a place that god is calling us to and he said we need to have a greater revelation a greater faith today because we are the group that's going to be raptured out of here [Music] yes sir amen god has allowed us to live in the closing hours of the gentile dispensation and we and you see what god has called us to you know there's many people that's been through the through the bible all the different ones that the uh all the prophets and the different ones you know they desire to see our day what a great hour and a great day that we live in this great day and you know what we don't realize that we are the ones that's going to bring the culmination to this you know all the ones we look back at at the great heroes of faith and we talk about you know all the ones that we go back and look through the scripture in hebrews and we talk about moses and abraham and and joseph and and all the great uh ones of the bible all the all the prophets and everything like that you know and they were all speaking about us we're the ones that they were looking to us to finish this you know what what a great opportunity we have what an awesome responsibility that we have that god wants us to come to this place that we can finish this god didn't god didn't call you know as brother branham said you know if god asked me if i could live in any time in the world he said i'd want to live in this day and this is the day that god caught you and i to live in and here is the time that we that we can live that we can manifest who jesus christ is in this day to the to a lost and dying world you know because there's a lot of people out there they're looking they're looking for jesus christ they're looking for a genuine christian you know there's a lot of people in the world they know they are professors but there's no possessors there's many people that can get up and talk a lot and they and they know the scripture but the problem is is they don't know the author they have no idea who the author is and they don't know it because they know it by the letter but they don't know it by the spirit and the spirit and the letter kills them and they are dead and and you know as as jack coe said that time he said churches want to get together and he said they want to have chicken and ice cream and and tea and he said the problem is he said the chair the churches are as dead as the chicken they're as cold as the ice cream and they're as weak as the t and he said that's the whole problem he said because why god is trying to find somebody that will actually take him at his word and prove to the world that there is there is one standing upon the earth that is going to fulfill exactly what this scripture says you know there's many people that you meet and and they're and they're good people and man they can talk to this they can talk to you about the scriptures but the problem is is they don't believe it know there was a man that was talking and and it just blows my mind you know because i was listening to this man and he was and he was talking about uh having miracles i was like well if we don't if you don't believe that that god still does miracles then we need to turn tear out hebrews 13 and 8 we need to tear out corinthians and all the different places why because if he still don't if he doesn't doing miracles anymore he only done that when the apostles were here well then guess what then all the way through church history from the time of paul irenaeus martin all the different ones all the john wesley all the different ones that done miracles all the way through the scripture then we need to take all of them out and write them off because none of that happened because all you look at you look at moody and and sankey and spurgeon and all the different ones and and that were minister that preached all the way down through history and all the things that god done in their in their lives if we don't see that god was still doing miracles he only done that for the apostles well then you know what the rest of the early church and all the way down through time then you know we need to write all of them off because they were all heretics because they didn't fulfill any of that because you know what if he's still not the same yesterday today and forever then we need to find somebody else because you know what then we just need to take our bibles and throw them in the trash can because it's not even worth the paper that it's printed on but you know god wants somebody because you know you're looking you know they talk about divine healing and all these different things you know god is a saying if it's written in the scripture right here you should i can tell you where i can show you where he put it in the scripture and he called for the church the bride to fulfill the and do these things we have he said the works that i do shall you do also and greater works than these he said so because i go to my father well he said i can show you where he put it in the scripture you tell me where he took it out why because he's the same yesterday today and forever well because this well paul said that he put the but he put the gifts in the scripture that he put the gifts in for the perfecting of the of the body that this all works together and then he and then and then people you know they don't even believe in you know uh if you talk about a a prophet well you know it well then we need to take that out because ephesians 4 is wrong because you know there's prophets the bible talks about prophets so what you talk about some people you talk about a prophet people just get all nervous you know they're you know they don't know what what you're talking about well you know the thing is is people have gotten to the place now where they just can't actually just sit down and wait for and just look at what the scripture says in black and white and and just pray to the lord comes and speaks to you you know what brother brandon said one time when he's talking about when he was talking about people getting in the scripture and reading what the scripture has to say and he said he said now if you run across something he said no you're talking about him preaching brother around preaching and you're listening to one of his tapes and he said now listen he said stop the tape and take it to the bible and read the scripture and say and study it out and so look in the scripture does it not say these things so then so if he the things that he done and and and then the what he calls the apostles to do what he called them to do is the same commission that he give us it's the same commission that we're given the same commission that they had so when when we get together you know then we can then we can call for the elders and anoint people with all and they will get healed you know we can we can call for those things you know you don't have to have be a preacher you don't have to be anybody all you got to be is a born-again son or a daughter of god and have faith in what you believe and realize that's your commission god told you you could do that you could call for the things that you have need of and believe that god will do it that's it if you have if you have a need if it's in your body if it's financial whatever it is if you have lost children whatever it is then you can call for it you have the ability to speak the word but people people you know but people get so scared and they and they kind of get likes about it because you know the devil just allows things to wash over people and push them around but you don't realize you know when things things like that happen in our lives god is trying to bring us back to the place that he wants us to be as david said when i'm overwhelmed when i'm pushed around when i'm tossed about when i'm on this life-sinking sand or when i'm in this ship that's tossing me to and fro he said there is a rock that i can go to there's a place for me to go to you know many people have you know they just kind of get lacks and and you know they and and it doesn't make them bad people it's just that some people you know they just don't realize where they're at and the danger that that this hour has and people don't realize how how we need to be fervent and what we're doing we have to have to always be on guard and many people have become likes about things and you know and you know and you see the you see all of these things that have washed in and draw people around and people get nervous about things that people don't know where they're standing and it just shows the hour in which we live because people don't have what they think they have you need to have what you what what the bible says and if you don't it's the time to be checking up and it's time to be praying through to get what you have need of you know because we've had many people that have come in and they and they've they've walked around this message and and and you know they've preached this message for years and all of a sudden you know we've seen this max mass exodus that have all these people that have left the message and went and all and their whole goal and their whole thing that they live for in this world is to tear this message down and all they're trying to do is plant seeds of doubt in people's minds and trying to get people wishy-washy and and you know trying to trying to tear up churches and all kinds of different things that has nothing to do but see the thing is it doesn't matter if you know where you're standing if you're in the rock of revelation of jesus christ he said upon this rock i'll build my church well you know what if you have that he said the gates of hell shall not prevail against it it doesn't matter how much seeds of doubt people try to try to sow you know what i know where i stand and i know what what god has shown me and it doesn't matter there's not enough devils in hell that's trying to that's going to drive me away from it but you've got to come to that place because people you know because if you start to have a doubt or you and it's not wrong to have questions the problem is is people allow those things to overtake them it's because you know you've got to come to a born-again experience that you know that you know that you know you've got to have a typos that you're tied to that you know exactly what god's done for you because if you've got if you've got the one that's wrote this scripture then you know what he's going to lead you and guide you through it but many people and i i hate to say that but you know there's a number of people that that have gathered around and you know they still don't know where they stand and you know and and and the other thing is is this there's there's no need there absolutely no need to listen to that absolutely i mean you know you know i don't i don't i i don't i don't agree with the catholic church there's no need of me listening to mass i don't i don't listen i don't listen to you know all these different teachers and and different ones and you know i i've i've listened to enough of them just to you know every now and then to hear things that that people have said but you know you know if you don't agree with it then there's no need to try to listen to it you know if it's not a faith if it's not of god then you know what there's no need to listen to don't even don't even entertain it it's just time to put it aside and you know all these people want to start arguments you know it doesn't matter you can you can tell them everybody's got their arguments about things in the message and you know what that's fine but you know you can you can talk to your blue in the face and it don't matter you ain't going to change their mind and you know what they ain't going to change yours and all you're doing is wasting your time trying to argue with somebody they're they're ain't they that's all they want that's all they want is find somebody that they can poke and prod and just you know irritate and agitate somebody you know it's time to listen brother i don't i don't have time for this you know i'm going to tell you what brother branham said this is what's in the scripture you know if you if you don't agree with it that's fine i mean you go on and do your thing and i'm going to do mine but there ain't no me of me and you trying to argue and fuss about it you know uh i'm gonna i want to share a story with you if you if you don't mind uh uh you know there was a a man you know y'all might find this interesting uh one of one of the things studying on abraham lincoln's life uh do y'all know who one of uh abraham lincoln's most uh well i wouldn't say the most favorite but he uh a political opponent that he faced more than once in his political career was a man by the name of peter cartwright if y'all know if y'all know who peter cartwright is he's the evangelist the uh circuit riding preacher that brother man talks about that you know he was in that saloon that time and he was washing the windows and the man told him said hey you can't have service here and he said he said well the lord told me to he said well if you if you're going to have service here he said you got to whip me and he said well that's just the next thing that i'll do and peter cartwright jumped on him and you know just about beat him up and then he you know he told him he's like you know if you you had enough and and you know he said the next you know he said the night this night or whatever when the when they had church so he said that man came in and got saved but you know here here was a here was a and i wanted to tell you that you know lincoln and peter cartwright they uh he had he had him uh they both ran for the illinois uh legislature they also ran against each other for congress and you know it was so amazing to read about these two men it's like well you know you can't find you can't find men like that actually run for uh political office nowadays that you know actually had men that had convictions and and those things but you hear these two men that are from different political parties and had different ideas about things even had differences about religion and you know there was lots of times that you know they uh had had uh argued about different things and not as far as arguing but more like debating things and you know and as they went along you know they had differences and all these different things but you know there was one thing that uh i thought was really good was um all the way through there through his life and i think peter cartwright was about 25 years older than lincoln but anyway uh as he as he got older and you know he uh when lincoln became president later on in life he was there and uh there was an occasion at a uh conference it was a gathering and a lot of people had got up and they were it was in the it was in new york and they had really been critical of lincoln and uh they had really just raked him over the coals and peter cartwright got up and and he told him you know he said he said he said i had this man as a political opponent and he said he said i i lost him he said we both ran for a seat in congress he said he said when it came to the ballot box he said i went down in defeat but he said i want you to know one thing he said i went down to the feet to a gentleman and a patriot yeah and he told him he said y'all all here and y'all all have negative things to say about lincoln but he said i want you to say i want you to know one thing he said we have the men in office to lead our country through this crisis and you know he talked about the kind of he said because he has a he has a god-fearing love for his countrymen and he has and has the cool-headedness and he goes through and he talks about all the other things about the life of of president lincoln why because he went through all these things and he said even though the different oh they had you know differences in and different things and you know they had argued and you know they had bad feelings against each other but you know what he said in the end he said they they never lost their respect they never lost their love for one another and he said even in the end he said because of the of the of the life that that he said because of the integrity that that president lincoln had through his life you know he he stood up to them those men and he told them what kind of what kind of men that they were that he said here's a man that has stood up and and he he's lived the life and he said you know y'all can say whatever you want to but he said here's a man that has come and he said we have the man that will lead this country through and you know that's the thing it doesn't matter how much you can argue and disagree with people he said but don't ever lose your love for each other he said he said no matter how much you disagree with somebody he said have love brother man said he said you know he said no matter how much i disagree one end from the other from he said if i don't have the same love that i did in the beginning he said then i need to come to the altar he said because i should never lose my love for somebody over things like that and it was really it was really touching to understand how these how these two brothers you know and and seeing the kind of life that they had went through and all the different things and through politics and all the different things but you know what they still admired one another and you know they never lost that from each other and you know and it doesn't matter all the you know people people can disagree with you and people can walk away and all those type things and you know i'm not i'm not the of the kind that i'm just going to write people off you know just because somebody turns down this message you know that's up between them and god i'm not i'm not i'm not somebody that you know i'm not going to walk around and have them under my foot and you know always going to you know as so many other people have done you know they they because you you got to realize you know your words are a c that you're planning and you know the things that you do the things that you say is is is show the life that you live it shows it's a demonstration of the life of jesus christ it's it's your testimony god help us that we never get into a place that we can't love you know i you know i i don't have i don't have hard feelings against people you know because they just do their own thing but i'm going to do my thing i'm going to do what god wants me to do i'm going to live my life i don't i don't want to be so hard on people and but i want to do what god wants us to do second this is uh second corinthians chapter four verse 3 and it says but if our gospel be hid it is head to them that are lost in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of this glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine on them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out the darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us he says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many abound for the glory of god for which calls we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal amen so you know we if those that have that have been blinded by this by the by the word you know then it's to them but it's it's a glorious light for us and then you know we can we walk because god calls us to the light you know it's it's the grace of god that has brought us to this and you know you know you can you can only share the light with somebody but you know brother branham said you know if somebody is just like that man that he decides you know that you know he don't believe in the sun anymore and you know he don't want he don't want to stand in the sunlight he goes down in the basement he's gets in the basement and he stays and he's in total darkness down there and he don't want to realize that and he doesn't believe that there's a son out there and he wants to be all hidden in this in this little cramp corner you know and hide from everything well then you know that's that's what he does you can't you can't change his mind you can't force him to to recognize what's going on but you can tell him about it you can shine the light but you know you can't make them walk in it you can't you can't make them accept it and you know there's many people that that have received the light and you know it's just like you know a medicine you know if you you can have the medicine but if you don't take the medicine you know many people many people have walked around and you know it you know they they walk around and they and they have a prescription you can have you can have a prescription in your hand and say well you know i got i got what i need right here but you know what it takes more than just having that prescription in your hand you know it's just like saying well i'm gonna get full because i got a cookbook i got a cookbook right here you know i just got a cookbook like you know but that's not going to feed you you can you can have all you can talk about all about the things you know and see all these great pictures of all this great food but you know what they don't put a single calorie in your body and you can have you can have this great all this stuff about this medicine and have it and like brother branham said you have just like that man standing up sitting on the doctor's doorstep and die because he's right there at it and you know you give him the medicine but he don't take it you you can have the everything but you know you've got to do something with it so if you've been given the prescription that for whatever you have need of here's the prescription god has wrote it in his bible well then you've got to do something with that prescription there's a place to take that prescription because it has to be full to has to be filled and so you know god wants you to bring him the word and show him the lord this is what you said and that's what i claim that's what i want that's what i have need of then say lord this is so i'm gonna stay right here till i get what i have need of you know just like as uh jesus talked about the the woman and the unjust judge you know she just stayed there until she got what she wanted and just you know he just thought about oh this woman she's just driving me crazy all the time just continually being there well you know what people you know they they start down this road and they go and then all of a sudden it's like well maybe the lord don't want me to have it well you know what your your deliverance or whatever you have need of it just may be right in front of you but you decide that you're gonna you're gonna quit or i'm just gonna let up off the gas a little bit or i'm just thinking i'm just gonna coast or you know i'm just gonna just take a day off or you know i'm gonna wait you know just to see what's gonna happen no if you've got this desire if you've got this fervency then you got to stay with it all the time until you get exactly what you have need of you got to stay with it you got to pursue it and keep going that's right don't give up many people have you know because you know and and so if you if you just you start to give up and you know brother said sight and time is is the two biggest hindrance to god because people get to this place and you know they get so hung up and then they say well you know maybe that's not for me or you know they see their surroundings no we don't look at none of that we don't look at those things we look at things that are eternal paul said you know the things that are around us they're temporal we don't look at our we don't look at our situations we don't look at the things that are around us we need to look at what god said we need to look at the things that god said because if if he done it for one then he'll do it again if he's done it for one that's right if if he's ever done it then you know we don't have to worry about whether god's gonna heal somebody why because he's already healed you if he was standing here tonight he couldn't heal you because he's already done it if he's gonna save somebody he can't save him because he's already done it if he's going to fill anybody with the holy ghost he's already done it the thing is is whether you decide that you're going to accept it or not are you going to make a way for god to give you exactly what you have need of amen that's just like just like brother wade trying to go out and deliver mail to somebody and they ain't got a mailbox where was they gonna put the mail if you go if you expect mail then you know what you need to go buy a mailbox and put it up so the man can bring the mail to you you need do you need to have something where because you know there's a way there is an order for these things to take place well you know what if you don't do those things in order then how are you supposed to get what you have need of because if you don't if you don't go out and every single day we don't we don't pray and we don't study and we don't we don't show ourselves approved and we don't spend time waiting on god to speak to us because many times you know people think prayer is just talking to god well prayer's not talking to god it's let him talk to you you know many times brother always talks about you know when you get woke up early in the morning well lots of times i get up some i wake up sometimes an hour or two before i have to go to work and that's the first thing i like to do is say lord you want to talk to me about something you know and sometimes i don't get nothing but you know what i'm still waiting on him to maybe he won't stalk to me you know sometimes i don't know about y'all sometimes i woke up in the middle of the night early in the morning and you know it's a good time to talk to the lord you know he said well lord you don't talk to me and you know sometimes the only thing that happens is a song comes on my mind and sometimes i'm just sitting there and i'm just and i'm just i just start singing it's just you know just in my mind or sometimes just really low but you know i'm i'm sitting there and all of a sudden i start singing to the lord and you know it's it's you know maybe the lord don't speak to you something but you know what it's that time together that you that you know the lord you know the lord that comes and speaks to you and all of a sudden you know there's times that i've gotten woke up and it's like lord what do you want to tell me and all of a sudden somebody comes on my heart and you know it's time to pray for somebody you know you start interceding and sometimes you don't know what's wrong you just you just know that i have gotten this person on my heart and i just pray for them and sometimes later on you'll find out you know they're sick or they have a need or you know there's there's something that's going on in their life and you know it's time that you can intercede for them it's god wanting you to intercede on their behalf but you know many times we don't sometimes we think well you know that's just kind of simple or you know but you know you we need to understand that you know god doesn't call us just to do simple things and you know there's nothing in god that's insignificant you know many people many people think well you know i'm not i'm not brother dale or i'm not brother wade you know so i i can't do these things i can't have the lord you know i'm not this person or you know i'm not an eloquent person or all these different things you know it doesn't really matter people people are well you know i'm i'm a teenager i'm this you know they want to find their excuses you know that god can't speak together but many times it's you that god wants to use god wants you to understand that you are able to do god's able to use you let god use you so if it we have these things you know all these he says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair you know you know there may be trouble all around you but you know you don't have to be in distress like a lot of other people you face problems and trials and heartaches but you know we we know where we we can know where we stand and you know it's just uh as the old saying is he said when you get to the end of your rope just tie a knot and hang on just hold on because you know that's that's the place where god wants you to be amen and you know he always like was reading the scripture he said you know with every temptation there comes a way of escape and you know many times we just got to wait on the lord and he'll show you the way that you need to go you know and this this is a very perplexing time you know people people look at the the things that as went on in the world today and and all the things and and you know you see and and you wonder you know where where people's minds are and and all these things and i was uh listening to a man who's who's supposed to be a preacher and and he posts these things on online and and uh he's he's really against this uh wearing a mask and you know and he just gets on this thing about wearing a mask and he just can't believe people wear masks and clothes churches and and all this type stuff and he's like well i go in these stores he said i'm not going to wear a mask and he said they're not going to stop me and he said he went to some restaurant they told him said you can't come in here without a mask on and he won't get belligerent with the with the man because he's like you're not going to make me wear a mask and the man told him so well you know he said he said you're going to leave and he said you come back he said i'm going to lock the door on you and then he got in he got into this little altercation with this man and this man's supposed to be a preacher and he gets on there and he says well if you try to do anything to me i'm gonna kick your teeth in and i thought my goodness i if i said that i wouldn't get on if i got on if i got on facebook or something and i was going to tell anybody i threatened to kick somebody's teeth in the first thing i'd be doing is i'd be apologizing i can't i can't and you know and he thinks he's okay i don't know what kind of testimony of jesus christ that you're going to get up you know if i said something like that i'd be embarrassed what kind of what kind of what kind of person is that i mean well you know and they said well we're we're preaching the gospel i'd be ashamed of myself if i got to that i'd go sit down i could you know and and people and people think this is this this is this is this is courage this is this is christianity no it's not that's right you know and everybody's like well you know we've got all these people out here that all these different different groups and you know they're out you know if they don't if you don't if you don't meet their demands and if you don't treat them right the next thing you know they tear up your store and set car on fire and do everything else and they think this has really changed we're really doing something and you know you know and the problem is is the world is growing insane but when the when when the church people start acting the same way how in the world are you supposed to be trying to preach jesus christ and bring salvation to a lost and dying world when you're acting the same way they do how in the world are we supposed to show show the love of god when people like well you know what you punch me well i'm gonna punch you right back i mean it's terrible that's right one because you know the the problem is is people don't people don't have a real genuine experience and the people that are in the pulpits don't have one either so nobody has any way of explaining it or teaching or preaching anything to anybody because it's just a bunch of theology that doesn't get you anywhere that it's not anything that has to do with that's anything that's in the lids of the bible it's not it's not anything and then this is what people want to preach and talk about it and it's a terrible situation to see you know because you know we're this is not our home that's right man you know we're just passing through this this is this is not this is not my this is not my fight that's right my my goal is to make heaven my home i'm just getting out of here you know y'all can fight but you know people argue and fuss over stuff but you know i tell them listen y'all y'all just rearranging the deck furniture on the titanic this thing's going down you know because people don't realize you know the thing is what are you going to do because one of these days that your your soul is going to be required of you and the question is have you made preparations right amen that's right are you are you going to are you going when when time comes are you going to be able to cross that veil are you going to have to face a living god you have to face a just god with the things that you've done when you've heard when people have heard the salvation of jesus christ and know what god has given and preached a message to show you there's a way to escape this world to escape the sin of this world to escape all of the destruction and all these things to get that we can receive eternal life have you made preparations for that have you made preparations to get out of here we see every single day we see california having earthquakes and all these different things and and you're seeing all these things and you know what every single year you look you look over the last 10 years and people don't realize that it's just gotten worse and worse and worse and worse and worse but you know like like paul said it's the the blindness see the blindness has come upon the people and they don't realize it satan has blinded their eyes to not see what is taking place they they just get loud just rock to see their sleeping they think they're okay they don't realize how worse this thing is getting because a thinking man a man that had eyes that could see man they would be ready to go as as wade was preaching on talking about the uh the passover you know when when they got ready you know they saw the things that had taken place in egypt when all of the uh plagues and all the things that had taken place and seen the things that were going on down there in the destruction and all those things and saw where they were standing and when he told him he said now it's time to take your lamb and get it and put the blood on the doorpost and on the lentil and get ready have your shoes on get ready to eat this meal and be ready to get out of here it's time to go well then you know what then you and i should be doing the same thing we should have ourselves ready to go from head to toe with uh with everything that we have to have that's put on this whole armor of god to be ready to go with our staff and our hands our shoes be ready and then be able to be eating this lamb [Applause] well you know that's the only thing that should be ready is is eating the word it's being ready to go but people think it's going to be okay and not realize how bad it is but god has called us to get out of here and make ourselves and and to tell the world what kind of condition this world's in let's prepare ourselves i want to be ready to go i want i want i want to share with the world the love of jesus christ the love has made a way to get out of here he has he has has made a way are you ready can you are you ready to go all these things have come upon us it's to prepare us for this journey to get out of here i want to be ready to go i want everybody to be ready to go that's my goal i want people to be ready to go i want to bring them to i want to show them where that rock is that you can come to that you can have a shelter there's a place there's a strong tower that you the righteous can run into there's a place that you can run into and be safe there's nothing else that's going to be safe but to run into that that ark into that into the tower that god has made that rock he's called us to that place that we can stand in that rock and be there and stand and withstand the things that god all the the the outpouring the things that that's taking place the devil has his time to to do his things but you know what god has called a people to withstand and to show the world that you know what god what he wrote in his scripture is true it was it wasn't just for some long ago something but it's for today there is a group it's like well you know are you perfect no i'm not perfect but i'm perfect in him i don't want to be perfect in him because that's that's the only place that you can be perfect is in him but god has called us this place lead me to that rock that is higher than i there's a place that's higher than than i am right now and whatever whatever you wherever you're at there's a place that's hired god wants to bring you up higher because you know what there's there's a day coming he said when he's going to call he said it's time to come up higher it's time to get out of here it's going to be a rapture it's going to be time to get out here and that's what i'm looking for you know it's a great time because he said it's a it's a great and a terrible day but you know what it's a great day to understand where we're living that's right i'm i'm thankful for it but i want to share with everybody that i can because i want people to understand that there is a there is a place to be let's let's run to that shelter let's not just play games let's set it as a scripture said let us lay every s aside every weight and the sin that so easily besets us and let us run this race that's set before us let's run let's do what we can because you know what we don't have but a short time but i won't i want everybody to know what i have amen because if you've got the goods then you know what you can you can sheriff's people i want i can tell you where i came from like that sister said i you know i'm not what i want to be and i'm and i'm not what i ought to be but i thank god i'm not what i used to be and you know there's a place that you can come to that you can say i'm not what i used to be and to show people there's a way out there's a deliverer and so let's all stand i i want everybody to to be ready to go that we can come to this rock there's a place to stand you know if we if we ever get away from not thanking god for our our salvation if we if you can't be if you if that doesn't thrill you every single day to wake up and realize what you used to be to what you are today then you know we ne we need to get back in the altar if you can't if you can't wake up every day and thank god that you i thank god i am free from this world of sin amen that song thank god i am free from this world of sin because i've been washed in his blood and i'm free from all those things and you know what i want to proclaim that because you know that's that's the only thing that's going to save
