[0:00] in first but I trying to help brother
[0:01] Bob and some of the other one and if I
[0:03] gave my life with that it didn't make
[0:05] you better
[0:07] it just made me dead right
[0:10] but Christ died knowing that that life
[0:13] he had which was eternal life that life
[0:17] could come right back into Bob and make
[0:20] him don't come for bid make you me made
[0:24] manifest in another form if I was one
[0:25] day die if my life could come back on
[0:28] you and make you better
[0:30] that's why snuff it's not that way well
[0:33] that we Christ had to do that for us so
[0:36] he sent us a we be like him not like
[0:38] each other all right has he appeared to
[0:42] put away sin by the sacrifice of himself
[0:44] and as it is appointed unto man once to
[0:47] die but after this the judgment
[0:50] now if I see that word appointed it is
[0:54] appointed unto men once to die there is
[1:00] what an appointment
[1:08] drawl says to be reserved to be laid
[1:15] away laid by reserved for one awaiting
[1:20] him appointed there's an appointment
[1:24] that we must reach for men to die but
[1:28] after this the judgment now this is my
[1:31] take on all this it is appointed unto
[1:33] men once today it didn't say every man's
[1:35] gonna die it's appointed unto man once
[1:40] to die there's an appointment with death
[1:42] brethren even talks about that there's
[1:44] an appointment with death that you and I
[1:46] have to me but they somebody not gonna
[1:48] make that appointment and then you have
[1:52] an appointment to go to the doctors more
[1:53] you can break that appointment and knock
[1:57] don't believe that God still can not
[1:58] though you can do that so that's what
[2:00] I'm gonna believe that I support another
[2:01] man wants to die but I'm not going to
[2:03] that point okay but after this the
[2:06] judgment so Christ was once offered to
[2:09] bear the sins of many and to them that
[2:12] look for him shall he appear the second
[2:17] time without sin unto salvation they
[2:19] appeared the first time physically his
[2:24] second appearing was on the day of
[2:26] Pentecost to go into the heart of the
[2:29] believer to give them salvation because
[2:33] there was no salvation look we'll read
[2:36] this new will quit will stop really
[2:38] early today for the law having a shadow
[2:40] of good things to come and not the very
[2:44] image of the things can never with those
[2:47] sacrifices which they offered year by
[2:49] year continually make the comers
[2:51] thereunto perfect for then when they
[2:55] have not have ceased to be offered in
[2:58] other words when in one day up the
[3:00] priests waltz in one day and eat this
[3:02] makes the sacrificing doctors forgiving
[3:05] everybody and starts living in them and
[3:08] no they didn't happen because he have
[3:10] coming release the life itself because
[3:12] that the worshiper once purged should
[3:16] have had no more conscious
[3:18] the sins but in those sacrifices there
[3:23] is a remembrance again made of sin every
[3:26] year right here's your answer the invite
[3:30] says anything well yeah they work
[3:31] perfect in the Old Testament no they
[3:33] weren't or they had their sins take away
[3:36] no the Hendersons covered for it is not
[3:39] possible that the blood of bulls and of
[3:41] goats should take away sing not possible
[3:47] they taking blood of all the notes can
[3:50] take away sin I will stop with their
[3:52] Google everything every books today not
[4:18] seven for somebody one day one day I
[4:24] will get work late for every house you
[4:26] know what
[4:31] [Music]
[4:36] about rape fight but oh well nobody will
[4:51] say it was is it usefully that women
[4:53] with blush and not even look at a man of
[4:56] blah blah blah now they just so boldly
[4:58] no blush
[4:59] so anyway was but it's not each what do
[5:06] you say well you don't see just don't
[5:10] say it much all right we're on Hebrews 9
[5:15] we have been talking about the
[5:17] tabernacle and milk as a date and let's
[5:20] drop back to Hebrews 8 verse 10 for this
[5:26] is the covenant that will make with the
[5:27] house of Israel after those days saith
[5:29] Lord Oh put my laws into their mind
[5:31] around them into heart now remember the
[5:33] first covenant was United tabernacle you
[5:36] had the three-room Tabernacle all you
[5:39] had two out of court in court holy holy
[5:41] it was a physical building and what he's
[5:43] saying now is the Covenant that I will
[5:47] make with the house of Israel after
[5:48] those days another act of the days that
[5:50] they did all these sacrifices I will put
[5:54] my laws in their mind and write them in
[5:55] the hearts because they weren't in the
[5:56] heart in the Old Testament they were
[5:59] just rituals they were something you
[6:01] went by able to do the don'ts and and
[6:02] all that and I will be to them O God and
[6:05] they shall be to me people who I've been
[6:09] reading back in chronicles and Kings and
[6:12] man they didn't do nothing
[6:13] said they'd have one King and do good
[6:15] and then half forward that was do evil
[6:17] and then they would tear the Groves down
[6:20] and they build oh my god and the problem
[6:23] I got with this whole thing is is even
[6:24] the good Kings didn't take care all the
[6:26] Groves down right they still have to
[6:28] grow up on the hill I don't know with a
[6:30] great girlfriend knock them down but
[6:31] they always left that Grove up on the
[6:33] top of the hill up there and that was
[6:35] always a pain and usual side because the
[6:38] next king to come by and have supper
[6:39] sacrifice living just bring them down
[6:41] here and start sacrificing to Moloch or
[6:44] whoever else the person in it but now
[6:46] remember God's going to be their Pig god
[6:49] they're going to be the people of God
[6:51] they still are the people of God but not
[6:53] every one of them are there's going to
[6:55] be a hundred forty-four thousand that's
[6:57] going to be the people of God coming up
[6:59] math right not all in Israel he was
[7:02] dealing with all Israel at this time
[7:04] back in the Old Testament but now you
[7:07] come into the New Testament Paul is
[7:09] trying to remember remember what Paul is
[7:11] doing Paul is dealing with Jews and
[7:14] Gentiles he's trying to get the Jews to
[7:17] see sacrifices are not any good anymore
[7:21] the temple is not any good anymore
[7:23] there's a better thing a new covenant
[7:26] which is the New Testament which Paul
[7:28] was trying to preach to them this is the
[7:30] New Testament this is the new thing runs
[7:33] them put my law in your heart and not
[7:35] put the law in in a book and put it in
[7:39] an ark and I think that's what we come
[7:42] to now I was talking about the clock
[7:43] yesterday we had a group of that time
[7:45] talking about people still going by the
[7:48] law they're still one of my books
[7:50] they've not moved into that new covenant
[7:52] the new covenant is it that you were
[7:54] gonna be a God we're gonna be the guy
[7:56] that God wanted so I wanted God's your
[7:59] God
[8:00] Adam first Adam when he brought Adam he
[8:03] said you got here I've got heaven he
[8:07] wants us to be God's well they couldn't
[8:09] be God's in the Old Testament well he
[8:11] couldn't hurt hiding their heart the
[8:13] only way for you to be a diet for God
[8:16] I probably come to Perdition well we we
[8:21] don't want to be like God the only that
[8:27] you know any say you hear song to be
[8:28] like Jesus to be like Jesus don't do it
[8:31] there won't be like it right but if you
[8:34] are Jesus Christ made manifest in
[8:36] another form color run then you will act
[8:39] exactly the way God wants you to have it
[8:40] man alright and you don't have to read
[8:44] that's gonna hurt you don't have to read
[8:46] the Bible to act to some people read the
[8:51] Bible to act do it some people read the
[8:54] Bible just eat the do's and don'ts but
[8:57] to get the essence of it is for garbage
[8:59] speak to you in your heart in your mind
[9:01] we'll talk about the sacraments a great
[9:03] mystery which is Christ in you the hope
[9:05] the boy mm-hmm and they shall not teach
[9:08] every man its neighbour and never man's
[9:09] brother now what happened was in the Old
[9:11] Testament what happened in the Old
[9:13] Testament they had the horrible they had
[9:15] the commandments of God and I would sit
[9:17] down ask the father of them of the
[9:20] family and I would teach Josh the do's
[9:23] and dont's then when I got over passed
[9:25] away Josh would teach his children the
[9:28] do's and don'ts okay and that's the way
[9:32] it passed now that's what he's talking
[9:33] about here he's not talking about they
[9:37] shall not teach every man his neighbor
[9:38] no words
[9:39] well you don't keep no really today
[9:42] today I'm not here to teach you I'm just
[9:48] saying words
[9:51] if God does speak to you I'm gonna get
[9:53] into that the sacraments voice of God if
[9:56] you don't hear the voice of God you're
[9:58] just listening to a man and he can be
[10:00] wrong but the voice of God can never
[10:02] ever be wrong
[10:03] hammer anima that's where we can put our
[10:06] faith in brother ground center face
[10:08] final resting places in that word all
[10:11] right
[10:11] so whatever brother Brown says that they
[10:13] say it's contrary to the Bible the
[10:16] legends about he said what the policy
[10:19] right and we didn't I had to put my
[10:22] faith on that that that was the voice of
[10:24] God now it's not the voice of God when
[10:28] they tell you to soul seven thunder
[10:30] you've made twenty five people you can
[10:31] do this you can do that right that's not
[10:34] the voice of God the voice of dark not
[10:37] even telling you they don't listen to
[10:38] the day so that's not the Boise God
[10:42] that's no way to say that's all well
[10:44] you're not going for a Bible thing all
[10:46] right so yep yep if brother Graham said
[10:50] it it's God compared with the Bible if
[10:56] it's not it's not the voice and done
[10:57] pretty simple huh
[10:59] and you shall not teach every man his
[11:02] neighbour and ever man's brother saying
[11:03] know the Lord for all shall know me why
[11:06] God's going to speak personally now to
[11:08] each person when he come onto that
[11:11] Pentecost and that's a great thing you
[11:14] got Peter Peter was the most contentious
[11:18] man in Jesus's life he was always doing
[11:23] the wrong but he was always standing up
[11:25] and saying I'm gonna do this and I'll do
[11:27] that but God taught some less of that
[11:31] though he used him on the day of
[11:32] Pentecost to preach the first sermon and
[11:34] three times when people got saved now
[11:36] I'll try that okay
[11:38] Peter said let's go meet with him
[11:40] brother Claude read that sermon men and
[11:43] brethren this thing Jesus whom you
[11:44] crucified he throwed a trap
[11:46] Oh the people who you crucified God has
[11:50] made both lordy Christ in other words
[11:51] that won't freak their hearts a civil
[11:53] man you're speaking as a goggle because
[11:56] remember they spoke so much as they died
[11:58] till they made Paul Paul they made one
[12:01] of them earth three and one of them
[12:03] whatever the God they made them died
[12:05] they put God into the ex-wife well they
[12:07] did the same thing with brother Graham
[12:10] now he's not big guy but he's a total
[12:14] time for all of you though but I will be
[12:18] to them so and they shall be to me of
[12:20] people and they shall not teach every
[12:22] man his neighbor
[12:23] like I said in other words I don't have
[12:25] to sit you know Bob's dad said don't
[12:28] bother the Oracles we've gotten involved
[12:31] tell them the lack exactly when he gets
[12:33] mad and he'll know we go and we listen
[12:35] the daughter self individual that's what
[12:37] I said you've got to hear the voice of
[12:38] God individually for I will be merciful
[12:42] to their unrighteousness and their sins
[12:45] and their iniquities where I will
[12:46] remember no more
[12:47] all right he's fixing to do away by
[12:49] Daniel seventy weeks by the state slow
[12:51] purpose make an end of sin
[12:52] reconciliation for iniquity and all
[12:54] those things he's going to do to Israel
[12:57] just like he does to us right that's the
[13:00] total plan of redemption and that he
[13:02] sets a new covenant he hath made the
[13:05] first fold now we don't do it was Old
[13:08] Testament cuz it's plenty of time plenty
[13:09] of shadows but you can't take them tops
[13:12] all the way you can't get a prophet in
[13:15] New Testament to go marry a prostitute
[13:16] and have children but in the Old
[13:19] Testament God told the Prophet we go
[13:22] matter you prostitute
[13:23] and have children and she'll and even
[13:25] come back they had some more kids so
[13:27] that's you can't go that far
[13:29] stay but brother Brown said he said the
[13:32] Prophet knows when to start a time and
[13:33] went in the top so that brother Branham
[13:35] gave it to us being prophetic people we
[13:38] can take a example in the Old Testament
[13:42] and take the type of where it needs to
[13:44] go on and stop all right and somehow its
[13:47] own took it on the well we're playing we
[13:49] come from
[13:50] new testament and then they all come
[13:52] from the old testament and it was legal
[13:54] under that covenant but this is a new
[13:57] covenant right a new covenant he have
[14:00] made the first over now that which
[14:03] decayeth and waxeth old is ready to
[14:05] vanish away but the old temple so here
[14:09] we go to Hebrews 9 then fairly the first
[14:11] covenant had also orbits is of divine
[14:13] service and a worldly sanctuary are a
[14:15] earthly sanctuary not worldly like we
[14:18] say worldly right that word day if you
[14:21] look at it right there it says and
[14:23] earthly sanctuary which was true when
[14:27] there was a tyrannical made the first
[14:29] wherein was the candlesticks in the
[14:31] table and the shoeprint
[14:32] which is called the sanctuary so we know
[14:35] that's made but you know what that
[14:37] exactly times justification
[14:39] sanctification baptism and all we go
[14:41] that's the updated new covenant that
[14:44] we're under now we're not under the Old
[14:46] Covenant we're under the new testament
[14:49] jesus said in my blood right and after
[14:52] the second Vail the tabernacle we just
[14:54] called the holiest of all because so you
[14:56] got you out of court your air court and
[14:58] the Holy of Holies everybody got that
[15:00] all right Tabernacle which is called the
[15:04] holiest of all which had the golden
[15:06] censer in the Ark of the Covenant
[15:07] overlaid roundabout with Dover where it
[15:09] was a goal pot that had manna and
[15:12] Aaron's rod that budded and the tables
[15:14] of the Covenant and over it the chair of
[15:17] the glory shouted the mercy seat of
[15:19] which we cannot now speak particularly
[15:22] in other words just gone they can't find
[15:24] it it's not anywhere members not in the
[15:26] temple some back took you more in detail
[15:29] okay because really under Paul's tenure
[15:33] he's trying to get him away from that
[15:35] he's been trying to get him away from
[15:36] that box with all this stuff in it you
[15:39] know
[15:39] he's trying to get them away from that
[15:40] to say that is now inside of do you know
[15:45] piece of wood or but now at one time you
[15:49] got you gotta take your top though at
[15:51] one time that art was coming from one
[15:54] city to the next city and it almost fell
[15:57] all over the car and what would we do if
[16:00] we saw something holy getting ready to
[16:03] fall we would immediately well you know
[16:05] what got killed it man right right God
[16:08] killed that man why because he wasn't
[16:10] under the Old Covenant it was do's and
[16:12] dont's all only the Levi's could touch
[16:15] it
[16:15] he wasn't Oliva and he was a good man he
[16:18] was actually one of the two guys that
[16:20] brought it from this country to the net
[16:22] so you got a like like said you gotta
[16:23] watch your tops but the man touched it
[16:27] and should not him and God killed him
[16:29] God want to kill the kabobs a duck
[16:30] killer no I don't think so I think he
[16:36] was just he would just he had to die
[16:38] because the water said he said no I
[16:41] touched him nobody touching these things
[16:43] that believe us and even the Levite
[16:45] remember the Levites had to turn around
[16:48] when they put the stage then the Levites
[16:51] had to turn around to get the thing up
[16:53] and I look at it had to be it was so
[16:57] holy why because God was teaching us
[16:59] that it come from that down to right now
[17:02] now the same thing if you look at Paul
[17:04] and the ones like that you see Paul kind
[17:09] of
[17:11] the way God moves you see Paul now Paul
[17:14] being the holy of holies man took
[17:18] garments awesome Paul and give them to
[17:21] people like we do prayer cloths and God
[17:24] healing well to me there's there's your
[17:26] Tabernacle had moved into flesh and now
[17:28] everybody it can come boldly to that
[17:31] throne everybody can come and receive of
[17:33] that gift that Paul had and that you and
[17:38] I have anybody with the Holy Ghost is
[17:39] God help me now when these things were
[17:45] thus ordained the priests were always in
[17:48] the first time in that will
[17:49] accomplishing the service and God out of
[17:52] court pretty much it you go in and out
[17:56] of court you know the list of the court
[17:58] it's open right but into the second went
[18:01] to high priest alone once every year not
[18:04] without blood which he offered first for
[18:07] itself member preacher has to be the
[18:09] first particular it has to be the first
[18:10] one to get cleaned and then they were
[18:12] buddy behind me right and for the errors
[18:15] of the people or the sin though that
[18:18] goes this stick of mind that the length
[18:20] of the holiest of Hall was not yet made
[18:23] manifest
[18:24] all right the Holy Ghost did not come to
[18:25] go inside the people right while as the
[18:28] first tabernacle it was yet standing you
[18:31] see what that means that means that
[18:33] while the first time when Apple was
[18:34] standing no one got the Holy Ghost in
[18:37] their soul no one while that Tabernacle
[18:41] was standing there God was at that
[18:42] Tabernacle he was in the tabernacle he
[18:44] was telling them to do what to do but
[18:46] when that Tabernacle became God in human
[18:48] flesh in Jesus Christ he done away with
[18:51] that Tabernacle that tower handle was
[18:53] done away with a man why would you think
[18:57] though the curtain was ran from top to
[19:00] bottom they should have known them them
[19:03] you should have known if it was rent
[19:06] from bottom to top you could say well
[19:07] somebody walked in there and did it but
[19:09] that thing was took from the very time
[19:11] that same like 20-something feet high
[19:13] ain't no short not way up there that
[19:17] same comes down and goes all the way in
[19:20] the bottom from the top to the bottom
[19:22] showing brother Brown said when that
[19:25] Oakland of course I know you know it's
[19:26] just a story show he said when they
[19:28] opened that curtain up so you can see
[19:30] Jesus Christ names on the cross now I
[19:31] don't know if it's true or not but it
[19:33] would be a symbol of that would be
[19:35] Christ on the cross and the bail being
[19:37] rent from top to bottom so the Holy
[19:40] Ghost distinct affined that the way that
[19:42] the holiest of all was not yet made
[19:43] manifest while it's the first time when
[19:46] angle was yet standing look which was a
[19:49] figure something to look at a figure for
[19:52] the time then present Old Testament in
[19:56] which were offered both gifts and
[19:57] sacrifices that could not make him that
[20:01] did the service perfect there if people
[20:03] would read the Bible just read the Bible
[20:06] that what does the Holy Ghost do that
[20:08] makes you perfect inside there was
[20:11] nothing in the Old Testament to make you
[20:13] perfect that could not make him that did
[20:17] the service perfect as pertaining to the
[20:20] conscience inside him
[20:23] the conscience which stood only in meats
[20:25] and drinks I was reading about in
[20:29] Chronicle when Solomon rebuilt the
[20:33] temple and brought the Holy of Holies in
[20:34] the Bible said they sacrificed so many
[20:37] animals that it was the number became
[20:40] you couldn't number many more thousands
[20:43] of sacrifices they did and then what the
[20:47] solomon do he sent him home with meat
[20:49] bread and wine he said everybody in
[20:52] israel home with meat bread one alright
[20:54] so that was but that was a symbol of the
[20:58] preachers today brother Dale is going to
[21:02] give you meat bread and wine
[21:07] okay and he's not seeing you home okay
[21:10] and that's kind of the way it was but
[21:12] they did it naturally but today we're
[21:15] going to get our meat and our drink
[21:16] spiritually from ministry all right
[21:22] which stood only in meats and drinks and
[21:25] divers washings and carnal ordinances
[21:29] imposed on them until the time of
[21:32] reformation
[21:33] but Christ being come an high priest of
[21:36] good things to come by the greater and
[21:39] more perfect Tabernacle now you'd think
[21:42] that was really pretty out there that
[21:44] Solomon built this and you read for how
[21:46] many tons of gold tons of brass and
[21:50] silver but you know well that's all I
[21:53] have now don't you think since this in
[21:55] the baguette tons of stuff the whole
[21:59] inside of the holy always was lined with
[22:00] gold
[22:01] so when Titus comes in and tears that
[22:03] thing apart and he just takes it all
[22:05] back to two of the morrow all right into
[22:10] the Vatican but look by a greater and
[22:14] more perfect Tabernacle it was him in
[22:20] his flesh I don't see why that's why I
[22:26] keep over it over again your flex don't
[22:28] sin your flesh is just holds you ducks
[22:31] in that hope you hold it it helps you to
[22:34] it what it does is it keeps all that
[22:36] spiritual stuff inside of you right
[22:39] that's what it does the firing mechanism
[22:43] thank it saturnine but look a greater
[22:46] and more perfect Tabernacle not made
[22:48] with hands that is the same out of this
[22:51] building
[22:52] though was it Jesus Christ standing
[22:54] there in human flesh or not of this
[22:58] creation because neither by the blood of
[23:01] bulls and goats and calves because
[23:03] remember those lives those are just
[23:06] lives that's just nature they don't
[23:08] just go away and there's no way that
[23:11] that life can come back and make the
[23:13] person pure and make the person holy
[23:15] right no way but one man but by his own
[23:19] blood what the life is in the blood that
[23:22] life it was in Jesus Christ
[23:24] did come back home the believer and not
[23:28] just ol number them but his own blood he
[23:32] entered in once into the holy place
[23:34] having obtained eternal redemption for
[23:38] us now show me in there where it says
[23:42] but not for your body like we've run
[23:47] into okay come on the label good grief
[23:52] if Jesus swiftly if what he did can
[23:55] change his body if he's inside of you
[23:57] it's gonna change your body
[23:58] we just got to believe that not believe
[24:01] something else not believe somebody else
[24:03] that this is just an old and it isn't
[24:05] okay
[24:06] you know why sometimes now you know my
[24:07] brother Graham coated the past now till
[24:09] they stink it's rotten it's gonna die if
[24:12] we don't think about a change just know
[24:15] things hurt they didn't hurt the horn
[24:19] remember I said we'd get up and chips
[24:21] now be good buddy try try to roll over
[24:28] and get to the end of the bed we're used
[24:31] to Deanna you know she just said if she
[24:33] wakes up she's 100 degrees and Mandan
[24:39] still one will be there in a minute but
[24:50] that's why they that's why it's called
[24:52] the pest as it's not called a pest house
[24:54] cause you're living in it cuz if you're
[24:55] God in human flesh that's God and you
[25:01] know what when he takes over that's
[25:03] God's flick
[25:05] neither the blood of goats and calves I
[25:07] believe it's now this but by his own
[25:10] blood the internet wants them to the
[25:11] holy place having them
[25:13] eternal redemption for us for if the
[25:16] blood right here's your your answer to
[25:18] them look for if the blood of bulls and
[25:21] goats and the ashes of an heifer
[25:23] sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to
[25:26] the purifying of the flesh how much more
[25:30] show the blood of Christ who through the
[25:33] Eternal Spirit offered himself without
[25:35] spot to God purge your conscience from
[25:38] dead works to serve the Living God
[25:42] there's your answer let them purge your
[25:46] conscience from dead works to serve
[25:48] living done and for this cause he is the
[25:52] mediator of the New Testament New
[25:57] Testament that by means of death for the
[26:01] redemption of the transgressions that
[26:03] were under the first Testament they
[26:06] which are called might receive the
[26:10] promise of an eternal inheritance
[26:19] for where a testament is there must also
[26:22] necessity be the death of the testator
[26:26] that's why they call it a new testament
[26:28] right because the testator is one that
[26:31] brings you bring something to you all
[26:33] right and he's got a guide to make them
[26:35] a New Testament so he can bring it you
[26:37] you know I can't give I can't give sure
[26:41] I could probably give all my inheritance
[26:42] to Josh but I'm still alive I gotta have
[26:45] something for me to live off okay until
[26:47] then but when I pass away there is a new
[26:51] covenant made and that covenant or that
[26:54] inheritance goes to your for your family
[26:57] members particularly your son you've
[26:59] done the Old Testament son where a
[27:01] testament is of force after men are dead
[27:06] otherwise it is of no strength at all
[27:08] while the testator liveth that's why
[27:10] Jesus didn't save one soul by living on
[27:12] earth no one he's all what about
[27:15] Paradise blood you don't remember that
[27:17] wasn't a new birth that was a fair
[27:19] enough that was him in parting eternal
[27:22] life to the thief on the cross
[27:30] No
[27:32] I don't see the Bible in a little field
[27:36] even the woman at the well that brother
[27:38] branham talks about the spark of eternal
[27:40] life she didn't get eternal life then in
[27:42] there if she did see the guy before the
[27:43] disciples then it would have broke the
[27:45] scripture Jesus Christ had to die before
[27:48] eternal life could go into somebody's
[27:51] soul don't care what anybody says
[27:53] it's what the Bible says okay brother
[27:56] Branham was giving us an example of how
[27:59] the spark got lived but she didn't get
[28:01] eternal life right then I promise you
[28:03] the Bible said that yes that's that's
[28:08] why we come to church that's why we have
[28:09] somebody get up and teach but you can't
[28:12] get it on phone yo her Testament is the
[28:14] force after men are dead but couldn't be
[28:18] a New Testament until the testator and
[28:21] died otherwise it is of no strength at
[28:25] all while the testator liveth remember
[28:30] the New Testament remember that's one if
[28:32] we cover the New Testament didn't start
[28:33] the book a man here our mark or Luke or
[28:36] John
[28:36] that's not the New Testament that's part
[28:39] of the Old Testament the New Testament
[28:41] that Jesus is talking about is the book
[28:44] last when Peter stood up and said this
[28:48] Jesus whom you crucified God has made
[28:51] him both Lord and Christ indeed when
[28:52] they were pricked in their heart 120 got
[28:54] the Holy Ghost the New Testament started
[28:57] on the book in the book of Acts acts 2:4
[29:00] the New Testament started that's love
[29:02] otherwise Paul's telling you this oh why
[29:06] this is of no strength while the
[29:08] testator liveth whereupon neither the
[29:12] first Testament was dedicated without
[29:14] blood
[29:15] we know that was the blood of bulls and
[29:17] goat where when Moses had spoken every
[29:20] precept to all the people according to
[29:23] the law he took the blood of cabinet of
[29:25] goats with water
[29:26] scarlet walled hyssop sprinkled both the
[29:29] book and all the people saying this is
[29:32] the blood of the Testament which God
[29:34] hath enjoined unto you but now what did
[29:37] they do it did not make the him eternal
[29:40] people with God it did not make them
[29:43] born-again believers so they went right
[29:46] out and just what I said if you read all
[29:48] of Kings the first King second King
[29:50] Chronicle they sacrificed their kids to
[29:54] Moloch then they did they didn't do
[29:56] nothing got cold what are they working
[29:58] all right saying this is what the
[30:01] Testament wants done have been joined
[30:04] I'm thinking they do then commanded God
[30:08] had commanded underneath he did it now
[30:10] see those were the commandments when God
[30:12] went to Mount Horeb he gave that command
[30:14] much to Moses Moses brought down but
[30:16] remember what brother Brown said brother
[30:17] Graham said they thought they got a book
[30:19] of rules but they got Jesus Christ why
[30:24] because the only somebody with Christ
[30:26] inside of them can live with those ten
[30:27] command if people never do live the Ten
[30:30] Commandment she had good people you had
[30:31] bad people you always going to have that
[30:33] but no one attained to eternal life in
[30:35] their soul in the Old Testament
[30:39] instead of Adam and he was imparted it
[30:41] wasn't it wasn't a new birth he wasn't
[30:44] more wrong indeed born right right
[30:47] that's why Jesus kept telling Nicodemus
[30:49] you must be born again
[30:52] that was never spoken in the Old
[30:54] Testament because there's no way you can
[30:57] be born from your mother's womb by
[30:58] sexual desire and be clean but now
[31:03] Paul's telling us we can by the blood of
[31:06] Jesus Christ right saying this is the
[31:09] blood of the Testament which God had
[31:11] been joined into you are commanded
[31:12] moreover he sprinkled with blood both
[31:14] the tabernacle and all the vessels of
[31:16] the ministry now look
[31:22] there was there was tons and millions
[31:26] and millions and millions of tons of
[31:28] blood goat blood I mean look this thing
[31:31] that looked nice and look when they put
[31:33] Christ on the cross program see little I
[31:35] can burger me well if you take Solomon's
[31:38] Temple and you think oh this is such a
[31:39] clean place that killed probably a
[31:43] hundred thousand animals have you ever
[31:46] i'm molested deer hunters and one animal
[31:50] makes a lot of mess because you got
[31:53] think the intros valid you got to cut
[31:54] them in half and you got a good public
[31:56] old gut up and you got it it ain't
[31:58] pretty
[31:59] blood running everywhere blood
[32:01] splattered all over everything
[32:03] but that's what christ looked like when
[32:05] he went with the cross but he did that
[32:07] one time so he doesn't have to do that
[32:08] again but what they did every year they
[32:10] went back through the same thing they
[32:11] cleaned the place up they did it again
[32:13] clean the place up and do it again but
[32:16] they didn't cure affine here to look and
[32:17] almost all things are by the law purged
[32:20] with blood and without shedding a blood
[32:24] is no remission there had to be shedding
[32:27] the blood our forgiveness and God did
[32:32] God did he didn't he didn't take their
[32:34] stand completely away in the Old
[32:36] Testament brother round city one he
[32:37] pushed it to Calvary he covered it and
[32:40] pushed it to Calvary but now watch it
[32:45] was therefore necessary that the
[32:47] patterns of things in the heavens should
[32:48] be purified with these but the heavenly
[32:51] things themselves with better sacrifices
[32:53] than date from Christ is not entered
[32:57] into the holy place made with hands
[32:59] which are the figures of the truth like
[33:02] I said they are examples right there is
[33:06] a candlestick this an example there's a
[33:08] shewbread this example that's all our
[33:10] examples of what we need to do in our
[33:12] life but it's not something to purify
[33:16] all right but Christ is not here there
[33:19] the holy places made with hands which
[33:20] are the figures of the true but into
[33:21] heaven itself now to appear
[33:24] have done for us nor yet that he should
[33:27] offer himself often as the high priest
[33:31] entered into the holy place every year
[33:32] with the blood of others for them must
[33:35] he often have suffered since the
[33:37] foundation of the world
[33:41] in other words Christ didn't soon as I
[33:45] haven't even what they did Christ didn't
[33:48] have to be killed over and over all down
[33:50] prison no he's a substitute which was
[33:54] the animal the substitute of the animal
[33:56] is the one that Satan entered and calls
[33:57] to follow right so the animal had to be
[34:00] sacrificed for then must he often have
[34:04] suffered since the foundation of the
[34:06] world but now once in the end of the
[34:09] world had the appeared to put away sin
[34:10] by the sacrifice of himself so he came
[34:13] as the ultimate sacrifice and he being
[34:17] the total ultimate sacrifice I mean I if
[34:20] I come in here today and of course I try
[34:22] to stop the bullet
