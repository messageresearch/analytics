[14:56] from Isaiah you can stand with me please
[14:58] and uh
[15:00] Isaiah 55 the brothers can put it up
[15:03] there for you and he has such a
[15:06] beautiful scripture and we'll just read
[15:08] from verse 7 here we may and says let
[15:11] the wicked forsake his way and the
[15:12] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[15:15] return unto the Lord and He will have
[15:16] mercy upon him and to our God for he
[15:19] will abundantly pardon for my thoughts
[15:21] are not your thoughts neither are your
[15:24] ways my ways saith the Lord for as the
[15:26] heavens are higher than the earth so are
[15:29] my ways higher than your ways and my
[15:31] thoughts than your thoughts for as the
[15:33] rain come a town and the snow from
[15:34] heaven and return it nothing but water
[15:37] the Earth and make that bring forth and
[15:39] put that it may give seed to the sower
[15:41] and prayer to the eater so shall my word
[15:44] be that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[15:49] shall not return unto me void for it
[15:52] shall accomplish that which I please and
[15:54] it shall prosper and the thing whereto I
[15:58] sent it for ye shall go it with joy and
[16:00] be led forth with peace the mountains
[16:03] and the hills shall Break Forth before
[16:05] you and the singing and all the trees of
[16:07] the field shall clap their hands instead
[16:09] of the thorn shall come up the fir tree
[16:11] and instead of the prayer I shall come
[16:14] up the Myrtle tree and it shall be to
[16:16] the Lord for a name for an everlasting
[16:18] sign that shall not be cut off amen I
[16:22] would just like to quote it's John 1 and
[16:26] John John chapter 1 and verse 12 1 in
[16:30] the beginning was the word and the Word
[16:32] was with God Amen and the Word was God
[16:34] and the same was the beginning amen with
[16:37] God so we know that and then it says in
[16:39] verse 12 and the word became flesh and
[16:42] dwelt among us thank God when we looked
[16:44] at the kinman this morning he met all
[16:47] their credentials have he hadn't been
[16:49] human folks he couldn't have been
[16:51] working man but he was human Hallelujah
[16:53] and we'll say a few things about it amen
[16:56] this evening amen praise the Lord let us
[16:59] just pray gracious heavenly father when
[17:00] we thank you Lord for this day Lord that
[17:03] prophet of God taught us that said on a
[17:06] Sunday Lord when we come to church we
[17:09] honor the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[17:11] Christ and we're so glad that we can
[17:13] honor your great and glorious
[17:15] resurrection and Lord we just come this
[17:17] afternoon Lord for another helping of
[17:21] your word Lord you have the table spread
[17:23] you know what we need Lord and I just
[17:26] feel that some would be saying Lord let
[17:28] that man speak to me God may you grant
[17:31] that today Lord may you Quicken your
[17:33] word to every heart and Lord may you
[17:35] blessed anointed Lord let there be an
[17:37] unction from the Holy One today Lord and
[17:40] father God inspired to us for we ask it
[17:43] all in the precious name of the Lord
[17:45] Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord so
[17:48] we're certainly glad you may be seated
[17:49] certainly glad to come this afternoon
[17:52] amen and um what the what the thought
[17:55] was
[17:56] was the word of God materialized the
[18:00] word of God materialized amen and uh you
[18:03] you know you don't need me to tell you
[18:05] you should uh most of a lot of you
[18:07] people have been on the road a long time
[18:09] is not right and you've been on the road
[18:10] a long time and so you don't need me to
[18:13] tell you really but that that words are
[18:15] thoughts expressed praise the Lord uh
[18:17] they're spoken and words are things
[18:20] words are very meaningful meaningful and
[18:24] Powerful uh you know I I there will be
[18:27] nobody here of any age that has never
[18:30] been hurt by what someone said to them
[18:32] words have the fact they can you know if
[18:35] someone cuts into your sister Peggy it
[18:37] can hurt you amen you can really and you
[18:40] didn't probably even deserve it you know
[18:42] our words can be very uh meaningful very
[18:45] powerful things amen and no doubt I'm
[18:48] sure you'd have been loved to be not the
[18:50] tomb of Lazarus that day amen when uh
[18:53] with the tears rolling down his face he
[18:56] said to Marie I I am the resurrection
[18:59] Murray amen I am that Resurrection
[19:01] Hallelujah and when he said to roll the
[19:04] stone away people must have been my God
[19:06] what's he going to do here I mean what's
[19:09] going on here amen and he just wouldn't
[19:11] uh you know father I thank you you've
[19:13] always heard me amen and speak that word
[19:16] hallelujah and something materialized
[19:19] Lazarus who was dead came back to life
[19:22] again and that word that had been spoken
[19:25] Lazarus come forth was fulfilled amen
[19:28] it's a wonderful thing amen and so you
[19:31] know that words um come through the
[19:33] voice box your voice is your word spoken
[19:36] and you know I I I heard it that the the
[19:40] the gene in your DNA for your voice box
[19:43] as in no other animal so we were talking
[19:45] about Parts last night so I don't know
[19:48] if they have it or not I doubt it
[19:49] because you can teach them to speak
[19:51] little words can't you but you see
[19:52] here's where the pirate falls down amen
[19:55] because uh to the human language is
[19:59] intelligent sounds with grammar that's
[20:03] separates it all amen Anonymous sounds
[20:06] but intelligence in Words with grammar
[20:08] Hallelujah that's your thoughts Express
[20:10] his words amen today and I'm just going
[20:13] to run you through a little couple of
[20:14] things here won't take too long I'm sure
[20:16] Anna could do it better than I could but
[20:18] you know the English language amen no
[20:21] other animal has got that no other
[20:22] animal can speak with grammar no no amen
[20:25] and someone said well the the the the
[20:27] the you know when the the Beast was
[20:29] there in the field we know that amen but
[20:32] it certainly could speak because he was
[20:33] the next two human brother Branham said
[20:35] so that that was that because then he
[20:37] was cursed but as we know it today nigh
[20:40] the lion the tiger the chimpanzee are
[20:41] nothing no we describe our English
[20:44] language this is just to get you built
[20:45] up in a little bit we describe our
[20:47] English language as having 25 letters of
[20:49] the alphabet they're formed to make
[20:51] words and sentences now I believe it or
[20:53] not maybe if you're listening to me
[20:55] preaching but believe it or not a
[20:57] sentence is a group of words that make
[21:00] complete sense
[21:02] that's why that's why
[21:05] when you're talking to some young people
[21:06] today you having the foggiest clue what
[21:09] they're talking about
[21:10] you know hey man you know I really cool
[21:12] it down I mean what does that mean you
[21:14] know what what does that mean okay so it
[21:18] doesn't doesn't mean very much to me you
[21:19] know I think if I was really cool I'd be
[21:21] nice and cool you know but that mightn't
[21:23] be what it is you know okay you know a
[21:26] group of words that make complete sense
[21:28] and as I say language is intelligent
[21:31] signs brother Aaron with grammar
[21:33] Hallelujah grammar no I just uh no more
[21:37] than 30 seconds or 40 seconds see a
[21:40] known as a person pleaser thing okay we
[21:43] start off with that this is a Pulpit
[21:45] that is a nine because it is a thing
[21:47] amen I am a person I'm annoying amen
[21:50] okay uh George amen and I've even got it
[21:53] Matthias somebody was you know just in
[21:55] case I get lost you know or somebody
[21:57] asked me money
[21:59] amen no that's what they call the big
[22:01] people that make the make the ties you
[22:03] know
[22:04] okay and of course you know I come from
[22:06] Donegal Ireland and and that's the place
[22:09] so a nine is a person place or thing now
[22:11] a pronoun is used in a place of a known
[22:15] like when you would say he she or them
[22:18] that way and uh excuse us a conjunction
[22:21] also as us amen and a verb a verb a word
[22:26] that describes an action okay so if you
[22:28] say Iran well I'm sure you didn't run
[22:30] the church but Iran well that's a verb
[22:33] it's a doing word it's an action word
[22:35] you see I claimed or whatever that's a
[22:37] two in word amen no I'm a verb it's an
[22:40] action word and an adverb is a word that
[22:42] gives information about the verb so if
[22:45] you run that's a verb but if you're on
[22:47] quickly that's an adverb okay now I'm
[22:49] not I'm not a this is not an English
[22:51] lesson it's just to build you up into
[22:52] something you know okay amen and of
[22:55] course an objective a describing word it
[22:57] describes it you see so if you've got a
[22:59] house it could be a large house it could
[23:02] be pinned and white so that's their
[23:04] objectives they're explaining your
[23:06] verbum okay here Anna
[23:09] hey okay and then of course this is the
[23:12] last of it as I said the definite
[23:14] article you know used before and own
[23:16] amen so if you see say the door you see
[23:20] uh or else you can use the indefinite
[23:22] article and you say uh there's a a door
[23:25] downstairs or whatever so that's your
[23:27] definite article in your indefinite
[23:29] article amen now I wanna I wanna show
[23:32] you something here and I want you know
[23:34] brother he's looked after as well today
[23:36] um brother we had I want him to just
[23:37] come up here a second would you just
[23:38] come up here a second please well well
[23:40] just you know a couple of seconds but
[23:41] you know nobody will tell you believe me
[23:43] okay I'm sure all right that's what I
[23:46] want to do okay I just want to sit down
[23:48] well I'll do that God bless you okay
[23:50] thank you okay you know that that's a
[23:53] very simple thing to do isn't it
[23:55] what happened
[23:56] I had a thought okay my thought became a
[24:00] word
[24:01] reached over his brother wait he heard
[24:04] it and he responded to it in other words
[24:07] my thought brother Samuel materialized
[24:11] okay so it's not a wonderful thing
[24:13] praise the Lord at materialized and you
[24:15] know something uh the material is what
[24:18] it's made out of okay so when the Lord
[24:21] materialized to Abraham it's just
[24:22] brother Brahman just said he's God he
[24:24] can just and the the the the the the the
[24:27] 16 elements of a body appear he steps
[24:29] into it Hallelujah and he's talking to
[24:31] Abraham okay that's the material but
[24:34] when it materializes it actually happens
[24:38] amen so therefore when brother Branham
[24:41] was talking to Perry green many many
[24:42] years ago and he was talking about
[24:44] having shot the squirrel he was trying
[24:46] to show him how he shot this girl and
[24:48] brother green being brother Greenly he
[24:50] said either this man is a prophet of God
[24:51] or he's deceiving me amen and brother
[24:54] Branham turns around and says brother
[24:56] green it actually happened it actually
[24:59] happened well when it materializes it
[25:03] actually happens Hallelujah it actually
[25:06] happens amen and I want you to keep I
[25:08] want you to keep that in mind today amen
[25:10] so
[25:11] if something materializes it actually
[25:14] happens and the material is what it is
[25:17] made out of Amen now the Eternal
[25:20] thoughts of God you know we know that it
[25:22] was The Lonesome spirit amen the Eternal
[25:25] Hallelujah that's the way he was he was
[25:27] in the beginning by himself he dwelt
[25:29] alone with his thoughts he'll never do
[25:31] that again
[25:32] that's a wonderful thing he'll never do
[25:34] that again amen when you're a young mind
[25:37] I remember very very quickly when I was
[25:40] a young man we used to go to the playing
[25:41] fields and I was a little boy I'd be
[25:43] down there playing soccer and you know
[25:45] for the school and all that there and I
[25:48] didn't realize I did not realize that
[25:51] one day I would take my daughter down to
[25:53] that very Park amen and we would go
[25:55] brother Gary after the little Walker in
[25:58] the park we would go for ice cream but
[26:00] when I was a little boy that says I'd
[26:02] never realized that one day I would do
[26:04] that but you see the word became
[26:07] materialized hallelujah amen that
[26:10] promise of God to give us children he
[26:12] said and the promise he gave me I
[26:14] blessed your children within you so
[26:16] that's what he said that came to me is a
[26:18] promise and I knew that that was going
[26:20] to happen and then when it happened all
[26:22] them years later without realizing that
[26:23] that she was already in me just willing
[26:26] to be materialized to walk in the park
[26:28] so that is a wonderful thing and God was
[26:30] like God I know he said he'll never do
[26:33] that again because he's caused his
[26:34] thoughts to be manifest so actually
[26:37] which is wonderful that you and I today
[26:41] are the thoughts of God
[26:43] materialized that's exactly who we are
[26:46] that's exactly what we are and it's a
[26:48] wonderful thing amen and and why is it
[26:51] because God is he's fellowshipping with
[26:55] his thoughts Hallelujah and his thoughts
[26:57] as I say uh have become material and
[27:00] he's fellowshipping with that today and
[27:02] uh praise the Lord Brother Branham says
[27:05] here that before God could say it had to
[27:07] be a thought and he says and God thought
[27:10] the whole thing through praise God even
[27:13] even the way he would materialize
[27:17] himself down to where he could be
[27:19] touched hallelujah amen you know if it
[27:22] had been a spirit who would that little
[27:24] woman with a blood issue have touched
[27:26] have it had been a spirit floating by
[27:28] she wouldn't have known what to do but
[27:30] he'd materialized and she could touch
[27:32] him wonderful Hallelujah and so here he
[27:36] was Sunday I I were there and God
[27:40] thought the whole thing through well I'm
[27:42] glad that we haven't I looked at any man
[27:45] somebody great PhD or something that the
[27:47] smartest ever there was probably sitting
[27:49] would put up his hand you know because
[27:51] he'd been around the block a bit but you
[27:53] know something God himself thought it
[27:55] all true so what you've got is his
[27:57] thoughts right here what he's thought
[27:59] through and he's working right on
[28:01] schedule Hallelujah working right on
[28:03] schedule there ain't nothing unfulfilled
[28:06] that he doesn't want to be fulfilled
[28:07] has to be fulfilled Hallelujah and so uh
[28:11] there it was and I'm glad about that the
[28:12] Universe the creation and I don't care
[28:15] oh my folks you know it's just NASA
[28:19] NASA the other week later they were
[28:20] telling us that the feel that some kind
[28:22] of a germ or something came down from
[28:24] Mars and a bit of rock and here you are
[28:28] I mean I'll tell you what to do scratch
[28:30] credulity to the Limit amen you know I
[28:33] think in mine's filter
[28:35] you know that's all I am a bit of a germ
[28:38] or something that can done from Mars
[28:40] but that's they'll do that amen but God
[28:43] thought the whole thing through the
[28:45] universe creation the cherubims the
[28:47] Angels the planets the Sun the moon
[28:49] stars and you know brother Branham was
[28:51] asked about that and you know he said
[28:52] well I mean the Earth broke off the Sun
[28:54] and so he said but who created the Earth
[28:56] who created the sun where did that come
[28:59] from you gotta all go back there folks
[29:01] and when you go back brother Terence you
[29:03] end up with the same question who
[29:04] created that wherever you want to stop
[29:07] somebody had to make it somewhere so
[29:09] praise the Lord amen and you know we
[29:11] look at that and God thought the whole
[29:12] thing through he taught Redemption true
[29:14] he knew it would have to be a blood
[29:16] atonement because life was in the blood
[29:18] Hallelujah he knew all that and he made
[29:21] provision for it and that's a glorious
[29:23] thing you know I but the prophet says
[29:25] that when a a brother and sister are
[29:27] married and they have a little child
[29:29] before it's born what do they do
[29:32] they get a little room for it they
[29:34] pinned it up they put in the little
[29:35] cribs and all and I started to get Bibby
[29:37] clothes and whatever not they prepare
[29:39] for it and God's prepared it all for us
[29:42] that that you know and it's all there
[29:45] and it's all in this thought and it
[29:46] materializes as we need it amen and
[29:50] believe me he can he can be thinking you
[29:52] know Psalm Stephen said oh God I think
[29:54] it's on me that God you can walk into
[29:56] something in your lifetime and see that
[29:59] God was thinking about that and he made
[30:02] the way for you hallelujah it's so
[30:04] wonderful night okay right on darn and
[30:07] the new birth salvation the church the
[30:10] last things amen the Rapture of the
[30:12] wedding sober he started all true amen
[30:15] and of course as the prophet said the
[30:17] greatest revelation of all as the
[30:20] Supreme deity of Jesus Christ that he
[30:22] thought through Hallelujah that wow
[30:24] Harley was going to do it and that's
[30:26] wonderful because even when brother
[30:28] Brahman was up in Chicago and he
[30:30] explained that God had
[30:32] some of them guys came and said I never
[30:34] actually seen it like that amen that God
[30:37] the Lord God said amen that he would
[30:38] take that form and it would just keep
[30:40] coming down hallelujah amen that that's
[30:43] what Isaiah would have saw that's what
[30:45] Ezekiel Saw all these men saw that form
[30:47] Hallelujah because God had chosen to be
[30:50] in that form of the logos and then the
[30:52] logos became a flesh and that was his
[30:55] desire his purpose and he did it
[30:58] according to his own mind Hallelujah so
[31:00] that's wonderful nigh and you know even
[31:03] when we look at the the material
[31:05] substance and and it actually happens
[31:08] you know creation shows forth his
[31:10] godhead that's what it shows it shows
[31:13] forth his godhead amen the Eternal
[31:15] godhead amen and a word that is a
[31:19] thought may it manifest God had to think
[31:21] it before it could be made a word it has
[31:24] to be in here before I had to think that
[31:26] before that could become a word today
[31:28] see and so that's a that's just to to
[31:30] try and show you uh what it is he spoke
[31:33] the word and it materialized and isn't
[31:36] it wonderful that that you know when the
[31:38] the man in the Bible just to give you a
[31:40] little illustration quickly you know
[31:42] when they couldn't get in but because of
[31:44] the thong so they said well in them days
[31:46] you could uh it would straw roofs and
[31:48] stuff like that part of it and you could
[31:50] break that open and and so they did and
[31:53] they lured the man done amen and and the
[31:55] Lord looked at him there and he just
[31:58] says take up your bed and walk amen and
[32:00] there you have the thought of God
[32:02] hallelujah being manifested and
[32:05] materialized and the man just felt the
[32:08] strength and got up and walked away home
[32:10] with his bed under us as Matt under his
[32:12] his arm you see so it's wonderful the
[32:14] word of God always has to be
[32:16] materialized when it comes out of his
[32:18] mouth it has to be Hallelujah and uh
[32:21] amen the prophet goes on the center not
[32:23] longness every word in the Bible is
[32:26] God's thought letter and seed form Amen
[32:29] in seed form because we know we heard it
[32:31] this morning I think the word of God uh
[32:34] is the seed Hallelujah that the shepherd
[32:36] sold amen and so praise the Lord um amen
[32:40] the Potentials in the seed amen the seat
[32:43] is in your heart the potential is there
[32:44] as wonderful amen that to think that you
[32:47] could take a little seed out of a an
[32:49] apple amen and think if you plant that
[32:51] and it grows into a tree every last
[32:54] Apple it's going to be a nut tree's in
[32:55] there right in there hallelujah it's
[32:58] it's it's it's it's awesome hallelujah
[33:00] amen on it it means uh naturally and it
[33:04] also spiritually of that seed in you the
[33:07] word of God hallelujah gets into the
[33:09] good ground it will bring forth 60 and
[33:12] 100 fold amen and it's wonderful
[33:15] Hallelujah and every word of God is a
[33:17] seed and brother Branham says it will
[33:19] materialize if you let it Hallelujah if
[33:23] you believe it that's what he says I've
[33:24] got it right here amen and Christ taught
[33:27] us that parable of the sower and the
[33:29] spoken word of God is the original Saint
[33:31] amen so take God to this word and God's
[33:34] spoken word will be materialized and
[33:36] produced exactly what he says it will
[33:38] it'll materialize and bring exactly what
[33:40] God said it would do every seed will
[33:43] bring forth after its kind it's not true
[33:46] Hallelujah when my wife plaster of
[33:48] potatoes and I help her this year amen
[33:50] and I'll tell you what we don't expect
[33:51] to go back to Ireland and see a feel of
[33:53] wheat
[33:55] I mean I don't like you know and I'm
[33:57] just being humble and simple you don't
[33:59] expect to feel a weight you plant the
[34:01] potatoes Hallelujah and if they're going
[34:03] to bring up to their kind it's going to
[34:05] have to be batavas and we're going to
[34:06] have to eat them over the winter time
[34:07] when we love them amen because there's
[34:09] no there's no chemicals in them and so
[34:11] that's what I'm trying to say every seed
[34:13] so of the seed of the word of God is in
[34:16] you it will bring forth the word of God
[34:18] hallelujah it has to do it every every
[34:21] last time you know and of course uh you
[34:24] know and that's the secret folks of of a
[34:26] perfect faith amen I remember I was just
[34:29] thinking about it but the couple and you
[34:32] want to see the little boy he is a
[34:33] beautiful little boy you call him
[34:34] Stephen because I give him that name
[34:36] Stephen they still that's his name in
[34:38] India and I know this is a fact I know
[34:41] them people could not have a baby there
[34:43] was trouble on his side trouble on her
[34:45] side and I know they couldn't have a
[34:47] baby and so they asked me to pray well I
[34:49] mean anybody can pray you know if you
[34:51] brought me in and said look uh
[34:53] somebody's just died in my house would
[34:55] you pray I'll pray
[34:57] I will pray I'll tell you I'll pray but
[34:59] could I guarantee that they're going to
[35:00] raise up again I could not maybe they
[35:03] will maybe they won't God knows that but
[35:05] what I will tell you this this morning
[35:06] is this the next day that uh I was
[35:10] reading the scripture quiet times in the
[35:12] morning and I was reading the scripture
[35:14] and just right there in the Psalms it
[35:17] said I have heard your prayer
[35:19] boy that was different that changes the
[35:23] whole ball game as I say Amen that that
[35:26] prayer that you'd prayed I have heard it
[35:29] hallelujah sister prepare the little
[35:31] baby is coming and within a year she had
[35:34] her little baby boy and I called him
[35:36] Stephen and he's a lovely little fella
[35:38] he'll go right and lay on hands on you
[35:40] and all and you know I'll tell you what
[35:42] it's marvelous but you see that's the
[35:45] secret of perfect Faith you've got to
[35:48] get God to speak on the promise that
[35:50] you're looking for amen like if you were
[35:53] looking for a new car amen and God says
[35:55] I've heard your prayer you'll get your
[35:57] new car
[35:58] you know that's but that's perfect Faith
[36:00] there's no spots or doubts you know God
[36:02] said I'm gonna get it I'm going to get
[36:04] it Hallelujah and that's what you got to
[36:06] get fixed in your mind Hallelujah did
[36:08] God give me a promise for this
[36:10] particular thing and if he does
[36:12] hallelujah and certainly amen faith will
[36:15] produce exactly what God says it will
[36:17] produce amen so praise the Lord does the
[36:21] Mustard Seed Faith make me very very
[36:23] little but brother Branham says you stay
[36:26] with it and it will materialize
[36:28] no if I may say this folks there's two
[36:31] things I believe that the devil doesn't
[36:33] want you to do
[36:34] he doesn't want you to have faith
[36:36] and he does not want you to pray
[36:39] that's the two things I'm telling you he
[36:41] does not want it and you say oh brother
[36:43] what do you mean by that the devil will
[36:44] come and tell you that you're no good
[36:46] that God hardly loves you you're going
[36:48] to hardly make it in and maybe you
[36:50] mightn't even make it in and he's just
[36:52] going to bombard you with that kind of
[36:53] stuff and then you wouldn't think a
[36:56] Praying would you who's going to hear
[36:57] your prayer who are you you know and it
[37:00] so tries to belittle you amen until you
[37:03] say well maybe that's that's right but
[37:06] I'll tell you what if you can tell him
[37:07] to step back hallelujah amen and that
[37:10] you believe the word of God what he says
[37:13] hallelujah then you've got a case
[37:15] against him and you can press the button
[37:17] amen and you can say I do have faith
[37:20] because God says I have faith Hallelujah
[37:23] he said I've give you every man a
[37:25] Measure of Faith and even if it's the
[37:27] smallest faith in the world I'm going to
[37:28] use that Faith what I've got Hallelujah
[37:30] and I am going to pray Mr devil how do
[37:33] you like that and he don't like it he
[37:35] don't like it because brother Branham
[37:37] said even the weakest sin here today
[37:39] yeah there's the strongest sin there's
[37:41] also the weakest sin whoever that would
[37:43] be if you can get on your knees and pray
[37:46] and believe it Hallelujah God will hear
[37:48] your prayer absolutely and I say unto
[37:51] you keep praying keep praying amen never
[37:53] lose you know I've been prayed for my
[37:55] husband for 19 years listen keep praying
[37:57] don't give up Hallelujah under the token
[38:00] you can claim your loved ones I was
[38:02] myself it's wonderful Hallelujah and so
[38:05] uh let's just
[38:07] uh Mustard Seed let it be let there be
[38:10] the word materialize it's true uh where
[38:12] did you get the dirt Amen Let It Be
[38:14] me in the dirt Hallelujah every item he
[38:17] called him and the beaned that's what he
[38:19] got it and then he made it and he
[38:20] started the foreman hallelujah amen and
[38:23] so that's wonderful praise the Lord and
[38:25] He formed the dirt of nothing amen he
[38:27] just spoke it into existence because
[38:29] he's God
[38:31] that's why because he's God hallelujah
[38:33] he's spoken into existence amen and the
[38:35] Word was made by the word was made by
[38:37] the word of God hallelujah Let There Be
[38:40] begin to materialize on the very groin
[38:42] you stand on the night he said it's God
[38:44] word materialized did you know that God
[38:46] just said let there be he believed his
[38:48] own word then he the Mighty God if his
[38:51] American he can do all things that's why
[38:53] it's the third pull if he says to that
[38:55] uh looking for the leaves and looking
[38:57] for a little fake maybe to feed on if he
[39:00] says be cursed and he walks away you can
[39:02] be sure Hallelujah now if Peter holler
[39:05] went up an examinantly he could have
[39:07] said well I don't see much closer about
[39:08] this you know he can say that sister you
[39:10] know I don't see much closer by that but
[39:11] the next day oh he said Lord that trade
[39:14] you cursed yesterday look at it it's
[39:16] watered up see because the word of God
[39:18] must be manifested must be materialized
[39:21] when he speaks it praise the Lord so it
[39:23] is wonderful amen and uh praise the Lord
[39:26] no what is Christ The Mystery of God
[39:29] what is Christ The Mystery of God it's
[39:31] the revealed word of God materialized
[39:34] amen that's exactly what he heard in his
[39:36] mind if you read the Bible you'll see
[39:39] that he wanted to dwell and not form I'm
[39:41] not form became flesh and he's still
[39:43] dwelling in it the father is in me I'm
[39:45] in the father do you believe that yes we
[39:47] do hallelujahs are two or three Gods no
[39:49] there's not there's one God hallelujah I
[39:51] tell you what I heard over here I'm not
[39:54] even mentioning any names I heard some
[39:56] people are starting to preach two Lords
[39:57] amen I'm at that sod not sad Hallelujah
[40:01] that you could baptize someone who's
[40:03] already baptized in the name of the Lord
[40:04] Jesus Christ could come back and baptize
[40:06] them again in the name of two Lords
[40:08] where is that going folks Hallelujah one
[40:11] Lord One Faith hallelujah or the very
[40:13] the very scripture that they use
[40:15] Hallelujah why don't they read the
[40:17] message and see what brother Branham
[40:18] said he said it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:20] in psalm 110.
[40:22] absolutely is we believe it amen that's
[40:25] who he is he's the reveal word
[40:27] materialized where you can touch them
[40:30] hallelujah amen The theophany Becoming
[40:33] flesh amen nine you look at his birth
[40:36] and that I heard it was announced and
[40:38] all these things you know and and you
[40:40] know maybe that morning
[40:42] when when Mary woke up I she didn't
[40:45] maybe just like an ordinary day but all
[40:47] of a sudden you know a light began to
[40:49] materialize Hallelujah a light began to
[40:51] materialize and and just as she was
[40:54] standing there there Step the green
[40:56] heart again shall Gabriel
[40:57] certainly we have no problem with that
[40:59] have you any problems with brother
[41:01] Branham up there in the cabin or in the
[41:02] cave Hallelujah where where uh he saw
[41:06] the light first and then he kind of felt
[41:08] the footsteps and just out of it stops
[41:09] the angel of the Lord hallelujah do you
[41:12] believe that would have been the same on
[41:13] the boat with Paul when Paul says sirs
[41:16] amen be of good cheer last night an
[41:18] angel of God stood by me Hallelujah and
[41:21] he said we must all be saved Hallelujah
[41:24] because of me amen oh it's wonderful
[41:27] it's awesome and I'll mention something
[41:28] else if I thought just in a while amen
[41:30] we could pack it up but anyway so that
[41:32] that's what it was and we knew that uh
[41:35] amen uh with Murray heart materialized
[41:38] it actually happened
[41:40] it actually happened amen uh we I was in
[41:43] one Church uh uh at the beginning of the
[41:45] tour and I'll tell you what I looked
[41:47] over and the Angels were right all
[41:48] around us right all around us I'll have
[41:50] no doubt about that today as well that
[41:52] the angels of God are around about their
[41:54] camper but those who said love God and
[41:56] so sometimes you can just get a little
[41:58] look in and sometimes not and sometimes
[42:01] I can see that Milky Way Cloud coming
[42:03] down and when that comes down I'll tell
[42:05] you really it's great things happen when
[42:08] you see that amen yes I look forward to
[42:11] my own congregation amen when you see
[42:13] that something's going to happen I'll
[42:16] just say this by by matter of fact just
[42:18] like here if anyone has a need to
[42:20] probably the pastor will come up with
[42:21] you pray for you anoint you with oil and
[42:24] that's correct procedure amen and the
[42:26] thing is that a brother came out he said
[42:28] brother George uh we do it this way like
[42:30] you say before the service he'd come up
[42:32] and say would you pray for me today
[42:33] after after the word say yes sir I need
[42:36] to say uh the doctor says I've got great
[42:38] and my this is what it is in my thumb
[42:40] and it's awful painful he says I've got
[42:43] it in my toe as well so I don't know
[42:44] anything about that but but I knew that
[42:46] away years ago they had too much meat or
[42:48] something you know King Henry the
[42:50] ethanol I'd always eat these big big
[42:52] legs alarm and all that chucking it away
[42:54] and drinking or drinking their Grog you
[42:56] know no wonder they were sick
[42:58] amen no wonder Hallelujah and you know
[43:02] the brother uh just you see see people
[43:06] really just at the close of that service
[43:08] not brother came out you know invaded
[43:10] them out he came over and you just feel
[43:12] the presence of God hallelujah and you
[43:15] know when you really feel it like a
[43:16] little baby this morning when you really
[43:18] feel the presence of God you know it's
[43:20] possible hallelujah it's very possible
[43:23] and so uh we prayed for the boy and uh
[43:26] amen oh that was it Hallelujah and we we
[43:30] went outside and we were talking to him
[43:32] I was just talking about something or
[43:33] other and he said you know brother

[44:31] that's what it all is that God the whole
[44:34] plan of Calvary everything and God's
[44:37] mind was materialized in Christ and
[44:39] therefore he's given him a name above
[44:41] every name hallelujah amen and that that
[44:45] all all the promises would dwell in the
[44:47] sun because it pleased the father and it
[44:50] was the son that created everything like

[50:32] dead you know I know they'll go a little
[50:36] bit longer I understand he's a god he's
[50:39] a god he's not the man you know and
[50:41] that's the way the Heathen will do it
[50:43] amen but listen you see
[50:46] the devil could not change God's program
[50:49] and God had said to Paul you must appear
[50:53] before Caesar so I don't care what the
[50:56] devil says what the devil does he cannot
[50:58] change God's word God's word must be

[54:58] so many children over in India have got
[55:01] uh temperatures amen and and and things
[55:04] they got there either they're burning up

[55:53] place where I'll put my name Hallelujah
[55:55] and he's going up to it and there he's
[55:57] with his mother after the custom amen
[56:00] and when many days were fulfilled and
[56:03] they returned the Child Jesus tarried
[56:05] behind in Jerusalem and of course they
[56:07] knew it not and verse 44 they supposed
[56:10] to come to being with other company went
[56:12] a Day's Journey and then they sought him
[56:14] among their Kinfolk and acquaintance
[56:15] when they phoned him not they had to go
[56:17] back to Jerusalem you know that and see
[56:19] they sought for him quite a time they
[56:21] never did think it'd be in the temple
[56:23] but maybe if they had a sat there and
[56:24] thought about it they say where would he
[56:26] where would he gravitate to you know you
[56:28] know because he was 12. and of course
[56:30] they came around to the temple at the
[56:31] end and that's where they found them
[56:33] talking to the doctors and the of the
[56:36] law amen and these great Scholars of the
[56:38] law and they were Marvel and not a 12
[56:40] year old boy could ask them such
[56:42] questions how and it was wonderful and

[56:49] Humanity God knows it he knows as well
[56:51] as you do and as well as I do we are
[56:53] human beings we're subject to the things
[56:55] that befall mine amen and so maybe she
[56:58] did scold them I don't know but she said
[57:00] she'd been worried and she said uh I
[57:03] wish you not he said to our that your
[57:05] father and me were looking for you and

[57:41] he said God is in all inspiration
[57:45] he said Do you believe God is in all
[57:47] inspiration and his congregation says
[57:49] amen so you don't be afraid to say Amen
[57:51] if you believe that amen because God is
[57:54] in all inspiration amen praise the Lord
[57:57] you see all scripture is inspired by God
[58:00] or God breathed and that's what I want

[59:09] it comes to the cloud and all these
[59:10] things we believe it stuff saith the
[59:12] Lord that's what a prophet said he saw
[59:14] and that's what I believe he did see
[59:16] Hallelujah if he was here this morning
[59:18] he'd be something he'd be saying Amen
[59:20] brother I saw it Hallelujah I saw it
[59:22] because he was a prophet he could go
[59:24] forward in time he could go back in time
[59:26] he did it both ways Hallelujah because
[59:29] that's what he was a Seer a prophet amen
[59:31] all these things nine it was inspired
[59:34] Hallelujah and you know
[59:37] if I said something today to inspire you
[59:41] that you're going home happy tonight
[59:43] Brother Gary sin wow I like that that
[59:46] just got the red in here you know that's
[59:48] a blessing to me do you know something
[59:49] it wasn't the little Irish guy that
[59:52] inspired you it was God because you see
[59:54] it's God is in all inspiration
[59:57] just that he used his lips Hallelujah to
[1:00:00] do it amen now praise the Lord he
[1:00:03] certainly is
[1:00:04] amen listen to this
[1:00:06] I talked about 12 year old boy now I'm
[1:00:09] going to talk about another 12 year old
[1:00:10] boy Hallelujah when was it written 1932
[1:00:13] no sir it was written in 1965.
[1:00:16] when all these things that he was
[1:00:18] supposed to have done all the lies he's
[1:00:20] supposed to have tell and all the
[1:00:21] immortal life you're supposed to have
[1:00:22] lived and yet of all he wrote this
[1:00:26] 40 years before 65.
[1:00:28] and it's going to be fulfilled that year
[1:00:31] no all friends just look at Abraham and
[1:00:35] you will say that no matter how many
[1:00:37] mistakes you make praise God God will
[1:00:40] always protect the gift that's in you
[1:00:43] amen and so he said I wrote a little
[1:00:45] poem something like this I just think
[1:00:47] about I was 12 year old standing there
[1:00:49] up there the other day looking up the
[1:00:51] canyon thinking see and he says you know
[1:00:54] God has to read a song do you believe
[1:00:55] that God's an inspiration and he
[1:00:57] certainly is amen and in this poetry
[1:01:00] watch see come to pass sitting there a
[1:01:02] little kid with a borrowed sheet of
[1:01:04] paper and he was about he says I was
[1:01:06] about only 12 years of old
[1:01:09] say two 12 year old boys amen and here
[1:01:13] he is and he writes these beautiful
[1:01:15] words now I know I don't believe that
[1:01:17] that boy actually in his own uh ability
[1:01:20] could have done it but I believe God
[1:01:22] give it to him Lane by Lane and you know
[1:01:24] why but returns I believe that because

[1:04:23] going to do this week he's not God
[1:04:25] okay you know what I mean and he's
[1:04:28] layered out many things for you
[1:04:29] Hallelujah and if he's let out something
[1:04:31] for you you'll not miss it don't you
[1:04:32] worry about that that's why you say oh

[1:04:35] and he's LED that out for you you're
[1:04:37] going to be there Hallelujah don't you
[1:04:39] worry about that amen that's his
[1:04:40] Department no and so here he comes up

[1:04:45] Dawson really and they went out that day
[1:04:48] and uh you know Dawson he's he takes the
[1:04:51] dogs up this way

[1:05:14] Canyon and that lion is looking at me
[1:05:17] straight in the face
[1:05:21] 40 years after God gave him that Vision
[1:05:25] that little poor
[1:05:26] and here it is being fulfilled word for
[1:05:31] word letter for letter hallelujah praise
[1:05:35] God you know they say Annie Oakley was a
[1:05:37] great shot she could put with a murderer
[1:05:39] and you know what I got there and you
[1:05:40] could later match in somebody's hand and
[1:05:42] she could shoot it at 50 yards or
[1:05:44] something she was that good a shot but
[1:05:46] I'll tell you what see see right there
[1:05:49] brother Branham could have stood with
[1:05:50] his back leg got and put that rifle over
[1:05:52] and shot that land
[1:05:54] you know why I say that because God had
[1:05:56] given them that land they could give him
[1:05:58] the bear they could give him that big
[1:05:59] animal with the 42-inch it's the same
[1:06:02] thing but what I want you to notice is
[1:06:04] that
[1:06:06] that as God in charge it's what what God
[1:06:10] promised him is fulfilling it Hallelujah

[1:06:16] materialized Hallelujah and it's
[1:06:19] wonderful Hallelujah and you know if you

[1:11:41] spoke about Visions I'll not give you
[1:11:43] too much longer but he did speak about
[1:11:45] visions
[1:11:47] and he said you know he had division the
[1:11:50] vision would materialize in front of you
[1:11:52] just like the radio just like the
[1:11:53] television you know you see some guy in
[1:11:56] a studio and he's getting his photograph
[1:11:58] for her there's a camera right on him
[1:12:00] and he's talking and you could be a
[1:12:02] thousand miles away and you're listening
[1:12:03] to him right as he says it Hallelujah
[1:12:05] you say is that him it is him it is him
[1:12:08] amen but he's over there wait that's
[1:12:10] still him and it says voice say so it is
[1:12:13] wonderful amen and he said the Visions
[1:12:14] just like that he said God if God uh
[1:12:17] calls you to do it he'll prove it and so
[1:12:19] amen and hustle materialize he says
[1:12:21] Visions materialize in front of you just
[1:12:23] like God and he said I may be at home
[1:12:25] walking through the house thinking of
[1:12:27] anything and and maybe sit down in a
[1:12:29] room and then there'll come a vision
[1:12:30] amen thank God for that thank God for
[1:12:33] that and you know uh I remember we
[1:12:35] brought her away we'd met brother away
[1:12:36] before he died
[1:12:38] and this dear little sister wife
[1:12:42] and the nice thing about it was we had
[1:12:44] them in our home and not there and uh
[1:12:47] he'd been raised from the dead as you
[1:12:49] know in in Jeffersonville but you know
[1:12:51] one day Broadway presented himself in
[1:12:53] the prayer line and you know something
[1:12:55] this this is just like the little woman
[1:12:57] that's asked for the daughter you see
[1:12:59] she wasn't going to take no for an
[1:13:01] answer that's just the bottom line she
[1:13:03] wasn't going to take no she was going to
[1:13:05] get her she knew this man could heal my
[1:13:07] daughter and I ain't leaving till he's
[1:13:09] done it that's about to say to it he
[1:13:11] could call me a dog he can say whatever
[1:13:12] he wants I don't care I'm gonna wait
[1:13:15] until he says the right thing so brother
[1:13:16] brother weighs in the line and brother
[1:13:18] Branham is praying for the people and
[1:13:20] whatever not was there there may be more
[1:13:22] praying but it comes up the broad away
[1:13:26] he says I want you to have a vision
[1:13:30] well you know something
[1:13:32] brother brought him of course that that
[1:13:33] catches you you know as I always said
[1:13:35] that faith in God you know if you want
[1:13:38] to bring a reaction from God you believe
[1:13:40] sometime and I'll tell you if he doesn't
[1:13:42] react yeah he's not God he'll always
[1:13:44] react to Faith who touched me he'll
[1:13:47] always react to it always with that kid
[1:13:49] you never know way that he will not
[1:13:50] react to Faith and so here's brother
[1:13:52] away I want to have a vision and that
[1:13:54] caught brother run him so he turned on
[1:13:56] he went under the microphone and he said
[1:13:57] you know people put away here's he says
[1:14:01] just asked me to have a vision he said
[1:14:03] you know people he said I just can't do
[1:14:05] that he said I just can't say oh y'all
[1:14:07] have a vision for brother we're here you
[1:14:08] know oh there you are he said I can't do
[1:14:10] that you know it has to be from God and
[1:14:12] he says I can't do it and then he just
[1:14:14] turned around he says but wait a minute
[1:14:15] I don't know right away and he says you
[1:14:18] will go to Israel but not yet that's
[1:14:21] exactly what he wanted to know what the
[1:14:22] man wanted to know that day when he was
[1:14:24] going to go to Israel would it open up
[1:14:25] would it be God's Will and there's the
[1:14:27] prophet giving them the answer but he
[1:14:29] said I can't you know I just can't have
[1:14:30] a vision of you going to Israel but you
[1:14:32] see because the man was persistent he
[1:14:34] expected something and he got it
[1:14:36] Hallelujah and that's what it was so the
[1:14:38] Visions are like that amen and you know
[1:14:40] when brother Branham saw the vision it
[1:14:43] had to be materialized to be fulfilled
[1:14:45] exactly amen the way he saw it in the
[1:14:48] vision and there's that story it's a
[1:14:50] great story I I more than one time it
[1:14:52] happened where he was praying with
[1:14:54] Denver to a house a young couple a
[1:14:57] little child lying in the bed dying amen
[1:15:00] blue in the face can hardly breathe and
[1:15:02] brother branham's just marching over and
[1:15:03] praying for it you know and it gets
[1:15:05] worse I mean if it's one flick away from
[1:15:09] Death that's it right there and he packs
[1:15:11] off and thinking and the people say oh
[1:15:13] brother economies got worse you know is
[1:15:14] he going to die and I don't know and
[1:15:16] hold on there's something not right here
[1:15:18] and he just quiets himself in another
[1:15:19] room or whatever and you know then God
[1:15:22] just reminds him what was the vision
[1:15:25] and he looks at the vision again and he
[1:15:27] sees an old man come in with overalls
[1:15:30] and a straw hat and he sees a woman with
[1:15:32] a coat on and a little hat on and they
[1:15:34] come in it was the grandparents and they
[1:15:37] had to be standing in an exact place
[1:15:39] Hallelujah and he wit it and the door
[1:15:42] knocked and they come in Hallelujah and
[1:15:44] when they stood in that place that
[1:15:45] prevalent all that child I'm praying
[1:15:48] Hallelujah and I was healed right there
[1:15:50] screaming right there and then
[1:15:51] hallelujah give me something to eat and
[1:15:54] they said give her something to eat or
[1:15:55] give him something to eat you know this
[1:15:57] is not fallacy folks this is reality
[1:15:59] Hallelujah this really happened and it
[1:16:01] really happens amen when you see all the
[1:16:04] things that are going on learned all
[1:16:05] about us amen and so thank God for that
[1:16:08] amen see the vision had to be
[1:16:10] materialized just as it was shown amen
[1:16:13] and that's what we're told though the
[1:16:14] vision taree yet shall it be brought to
[1:16:17] pass amen it has to it has to
[1:16:19] materialize everything that God spoke
[1:16:21] his word has to materialize amen and
[1:16:24] praise the Lord I'm just gonna start
[1:16:26] winding down for you now amen praise the
[1:16:28] Lord can you imagine
[1:16:30] can you imagine if you'd have been there
[1:16:32] with Jesus that day just like today see
[1:16:35] and here's the Lord preparing for the
[1:16:38] Passover and he says to two of his
[1:16:40] disciples let's say James and John just

[1:29:48] Hallelujah well let me just get up into
[1:29:50] this and this is the close I've got

[1:30:20] that has to materialize so is there a
[1:30:23] city Abraham look for it Ezra said
[1:30:26] Brother Gary it has to be a city because
[1:30:29] he said there's a city Hallelujah and we
[1:30:31] are going to that City amen and you know
[1:30:34] it's real enthusiasm it's not worked up
[1:30:36] I didn't give myself a couple of tablets

[1:30:40] Ghost tablet amen and you know that's
[1:30:42] wonderful Hallelujah it throws my heart
[1:30:44] amen and it has to materialize when he
[1:30:47] said let there be light it doesn't

[1:30:50] happening but it was already
[1:30:51] materializing Hallelujah well well

[1:31:04] every angle out of the day
[1:31:06] the word is in you
[1:31:09] brother Branham says the word that is in
[1:31:12] you will materialize is that right
[1:31:16] brother Samuel that's the quote it will
[1:31:18] quote see potentially it's there the
[1:31:22] word promised before the foundation of
[1:31:24] the world and around here that only
[1:31:26] reflects the negatives that reflects the
[1:31:28] positive the word see and the same thing
[1:31:31] or the translation of the Bride
[1:31:34] see the word a new materializing every
[1:31:38] time you come to church this is the
[1:31:40] place to be because the word is
[1:31:42] materializing in you hallelujah amen
[1:31:44] until maybe just like the Enoch you know
[1:31:46] we get to the place where that's it
[1:31:48] Hallelujah we've reached it and amen and
[1:31:51] he says the word that's in you now watch
[1:31:54] this is what he says
[1:31:56] the body will materialize around that
[1:31:59] word
[1:32:00] wow so we've got something wonderful in
[1:32:02] us today Hallelujah we've got the word
[1:32:04] of God and did it with Sarah he says and
[1:32:07] it will materialize like that with us
