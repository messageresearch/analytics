[23:00] of the Lord good to see everybody
[23:03] if you'd like turning your scriptures
[23:04] we're going to be reading from
[23:05] Revelations 1 and then we're going to
[23:08] Ezekiel 36.
[23:10] Revelation 1 Ezekiel 36.
[23:14] now remember brother Louise will be

[23:18] willing then the Bible study will be
[23:21] this coming Saturday six o'clock then
[23:23] brother prakash will be with us on
[23:25] Wednesday the 6th of May and then
[23:30] remember the Father's Day fishing trip
[23:32] the times are together and the Fourth of
[23:35] July and the meetings coming up so
[23:38] remember all of these I mean and just
[23:41] pray at the Lord would be with each one
[23:43] amen
[23:45] let's just pray Heavenly Father we thank
[23:48] you that we love you
[23:49] we desire one thing from you and that is
[23:52] to be able to understand what you're
[23:55] trying to say unto us
[23:58] and it was brought unto us by way of the
[24:00] Prophet messenger so we don't have to
[24:02] worry about it whose word it is we know
[24:04] whose it is it's your word and we pray
[24:07] that you would just bless us and give us
[24:09] understanding ears to hear Lord and you
[24:13] do as we were singing that you would
[24:15] Open the Eyes of our heart
[24:17] that Lord we may see you forgive our
[24:19] sins lead us by thine understanding and
[24:23] just direct us in your loving grace in
[24:26] Jesus name amen
[24:30] so we'll go to Revelations
[24:35] 1
[24:37] . now turn to see the voice that Spate
[24:39] with me and being turned I saw seven
[24:41] golden candlesticks in the midst of the
[24:44] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[24:46] of man clothed with a garment down to
[24:48] the foot and gird about the pouch with a
[24:50] golden girdle
[24:51] his head and his hairs were white like
[24:54] wool that's white as snow in his eyes
[24:56] were as a flame of fire
[24:58] and his feet like undefined Bryce as if
[25:01] they burned in a furnace
[25:04] and his voice as the sound of many
[25:07] Waters
[25:08] all right now we should be catching on
[25:11] to that's part of what we're covering
[25:13] now because we've come through the
[25:17] bringing up to the the New Testament
[25:20] form and then talking about the baptism
[25:22] of the Holy Ghost and that's what these
[25:25] things are talking about the description
[25:27] of him during that time now let's go to
[25:30] Ezekiel
[25:31] 36 and we'll read
[25:36] we'll go to verse 26.
[25:39] a new heart also would I give you in a
[25:42] new spirit when I put within you and I
[25:44] will take away the Stony heart out of
[25:46] your flesh and give you an heart of
[25:49] Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[25:52] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[25:55] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[25:58] them you may be seated the Lord had his
[26:01] Blessing to the reading of the word
[26:07] now I've
[26:09] got a couple announcements to make a
[26:11] couple of little things to say before we
[26:14] get into the message so you know
[26:17] bear with me a moment and think about it
[26:20] now we've
[26:22] observed sometimes the kids outside and
[26:25] kids were very proud of you and we know
[26:27] your kids and we know you act like kids
[26:29] and we're not condemning you for acting
[26:32] like kids
[26:34] but we are a church and we have to
[26:38] handle things to make sure you know that
[26:42] we can be safe and everything going
[26:45] right so now kids I know you play
[26:47] sometimes pretty rough I've even gotten
[26:49] on to you a few times myself about
[26:51] running around with sticks and that are
[26:53] sharpened off and pointing at each other
[26:55] you know the boys now the girls don't do
[26:58] that too much but boys they you know
[27:00] they get into a lot of things but be
[27:03] careful because you can get hurt
[27:05] you could hurt somebody and it wouldn't
[27:08] be no good of saying well it wasn't my
[27:10] fault
[27:11] that won't put an eye back in a socket
[27:14] it won't cause something to heal up
[27:16] that's hurting and damaged for life
[27:19] so what you're playing and and your
[27:23] doings and uh you know uh stay basically
[27:27] on our playground don't be going over on
[27:30] the other part even it's a good parking
[27:32] lot over there but don't be going over
[27:34] there because the one main thing is if
[27:37] you go over there we can't say nothing
[27:39] if they come over here and that's why I
[27:42] instruct you not to play basketball at a
[27:45] certain time when we meet here and
[27:47] you've kind of got away from that but
[27:49] like on Wednesdays and things don't play
[27:51] ball and on Sunday mornings and things
[27:53] don't play ball out there because it
[27:55] invites other kids to come and want to
[27:58] play and and I'll rock that and we don't
[28:00] care about doing but we don't want
[28:04] nobody to have problems and things uh
[28:07] the playground is is dire for you to use
[28:10] but use it rightfully into doing so
[28:13] don't don't go over there and play in
[28:15] the hers and don't go up in front of the
[28:17] building up in over here I've seen a lot
[28:19] of you do do it you have been known to
[28:23] get up on the air conditioner
[28:26] machines out there and been standing out
[28:29] there on things and you know just kind
[28:32] of cool it down just a little bit on the
[28:35] basis of not being too doing and now
[28:38] mama and daddy I've always told you you
[28:40] know if somebody comes and tells you
[28:42] that your kids are doing things uh don't
[28:44] you get upset with them because they're
[28:46] told of me to do it especially so I
[28:48] instruct the deacons to kind of mull
[28:51] around a little bit in between in
[28:54] different parts of the service and for
[28:56] them to correct the children and have
[28:59] them to do things correctly you know and
[29:03] play correctly and and not be into the
[29:06] dangers of anything because we don't
[29:07] want somebody to get hurt
[29:10] we try our best to have you the
[29:12] playgrounds to where you can do we've
[29:14] got three sections of playgrounds and uh
[29:18] you know slides and different things so
[29:21] try to do it according to
[29:24] um the right order and when you're out
[29:27] there you know the little bitty ones are
[29:29] over here playing down on their bottom
[29:31] part of it over there and and of the
[29:34] playground and you know don't be running
[29:36] backwards and forth by them and all and
[29:39] running and doing because you're going
[29:41] to hurt somebody
[29:42] and you know you don't
[29:44] uh Mama didn't want you hurt when you
[29:47] was little
[29:48] but now mommies and daddies remember
[29:50] that
[29:51] okay
[29:53] remember you didn't want your kid hurt
[29:56] you know well they're they're you know
[29:58] they're only like grown some of them
[29:59] grown up now but still that doesn't uh
[30:03] make things in the right order for you
[30:05] to do so just kind of
[30:07] you know control yourselves
[30:10] and not being too rough and playing with
[30:13] the kids and we haven't got a set order
[30:15] that these have got to play here and
[30:17] these have got to play here and that one
[30:18] there we do have a set order of of
[30:21] little ones about them in the next group
[30:23] is the older ones in the bigger kids
[30:26] needs to stay up on this top end up here
[30:29] and you have your own things and doings
[30:31] and you know and let some of the kids
[30:34] play and throughout our you know take
[30:37] care of each other don't be uh harmful
[30:41] to each other oh you say well that
[30:43] they're they're not up here where we're
[30:45] they're not here where we're we are well
[30:47] then go get somebody and let them direct
[30:49] them out of the way and make sure
[30:51] everything's all right keep it going in
[30:54] a safe and insane matter
[30:56] you know to where you can can do and uh
[31:01] you know
[31:02] have everything indecently in order
[31:04] now
[31:06] uh
[31:07] we uh
[31:09] we have a little problem with one thing
[31:11] that we need to cover
[31:13] that
[31:15] um sometimes kids are kids but they are
[31:19] a little bit
[31:20] on the wrong side about being kids
[31:23] and uh sometimes they kind of
[31:27] uh make light of each other or whatever
[31:29] and uh you know don't do that kids
[31:33] uh don't think because you're our One
[31:36] race that you can make fun of another
[31:38] race brother Dale will get upset with
[31:41] you in a hurry when you start trying to
[31:43] do those things because that's not
[31:45] correct everybody is the same here it's
[31:49] not you know that we have a the answer
[31:52] we have of that or we have a Dale Clan
[31:55] and nobody else is not allowed the
[31:57] reason the Dale Clan's in charge of a
[31:59] lot of things is because they will do
[32:01] their jobs offices and things and you
[32:04] know a lot of you wouldn't take the job
[32:06] so somebody's got to do it so it's not
[32:09] that but
[32:10] don't be making light of nobody
[32:13] because just remember you might lie to
[32:15] somebody somebody gonna lie to you
[32:17] and you know it's not fun
[32:20] it's not doing it's not uh nice to to do
[32:24] anything contrary to one to the other of
[32:27] the kids all of your kids are the same
[32:29] and kids are good they can get over it
[32:32] and all like that but it still hurts
[32:34] feelings for the kids sometimes to you
[32:37] know maybe pull a little back pull a
[32:40] little back and play themselves and
[32:42] don't let the others everybody play
[32:44] together we try to make a playground
[32:46] where you can play together and have a
[32:48] good time and all like that but just let
[32:51] it be that you'll do it in order and not
[32:53] making no uh points of separating in
[32:57] sides you know to pull away or to do
[33:00] anything and uh you know you'd say well
[33:03] uh they don't want to play with me well
[33:06] then next day you won't want to play
[33:09] with them so that's that's kids but that
[33:12] shouldn't be we're trying to be
[33:14] Christians
[33:16] you know children we're trying to be
[33:18] Christians and you get somebody come in
[33:20] and they see you doing little things and
[33:25] that doesn't work too good especially
[33:26] when you're kind of I could Yaki over
[33:29] and pull this pie outside and get your
[33:31] little groups and parties and things you
[33:33] shouldn't do that
[33:35] as a matter of fact I have tried to
[33:37] contact the person and even I did this
[33:40] morning
[33:41] we had one sister that is not coming to
[33:44] the church now
[33:45] and one of the reasons she's not coming
[33:48] is because her granddaughter was
[33:51] offended by some things somebody here
[33:54] said to her
[33:55] some of the girls and boys or somebody
[33:57] said something to the girl and made her
[34:00] upset
[34:01] and she doesn't want to come to this
[34:03] church well now you
[34:06] you that done that or whatever you done
[34:08] you need to
[34:10] straighten things up because that's your
[34:12] responsibility you know you're
[34:14] responsible for that person you saw that
[34:16] it's they just well that's right well
[34:18] what would it be if it was your child
[34:21] what would you do if it was your child
[34:24] see it changes if we switch it around on
[34:26] the other side defense you know makes
[34:28] things a little bit different if we swap
[34:30] it over you know uh in doing but you
[34:34] know I'm trying to contact the person
[34:36] because we knew they had stopped but not
[34:40] no reason but you know and I've always
[34:42] been if you leave here don't expect me
[34:45] to call you
[34:46] you know because I'm not going to beg
[34:49] you to come back
[34:50] and I wouldn't try to beg anyone to do
[34:53] that but I just felt obligated to if
[34:57] something was said by somebody here an
[34:59] action or reaction that would be
[35:02] anything derogatory to the right order
[35:05] it needs to be dealt with here
[35:08] so you know if you uh you just don't
[35:11] never
[35:12] just remember tomorrow is your day
[35:16] you know that's the best way to say it
[35:18] tomorrow is your day that somebody will
[35:21] be you'll have problems well then you're
[35:24] going to say well you know I didn't do
[35:26] well you know just try to be in the
[35:30] right order and get everything into the
[35:34] point to where that everybody can do
[35:38] because we're trying to win people to
[35:41] the Lord
[35:43] and you can't win people to the Lord if
[35:46] you're making lie to them
[35:48] or are offending them you know or saying
[35:52] things it shouldn't be said
[35:54] uh you know those things they're not
[35:58] winning people you're not trying to be a
[36:00] Christian
[36:01] and and the Lord will deal with you in
[36:04] those orders because if you're doing it
[36:06] deliberately then he will uh work upon
[36:10] you because that's his way of doing it
[36:12] all right so don't do that don't be uh
[36:16] pulling apart don't be doing it don't
[36:18] make lie to nobody
[36:20] you know because you make lie to
[36:22] somebody just remember
[36:24] tomorrow somebody might lie to you
[36:28] it may take a while before somebody does
[36:30] it but then you'll feel bad and you'll
[36:32] realize so just don't do it to nobody
[36:34] else why can't you just love each other
[36:35] have a good time for the kids to be
[36:38] playing together and oh you got your
[36:40] buddies you got your partners and plans
[36:43] you know and doings all like that and
[36:46] let me say it to do it I see a lot of
[36:48] you adults it's even worse than the kids
[36:50] too because some of you adults won't
[36:52] even speak to each other hardly some of
[36:54] you probably haven't shook hands with
[36:55] each other in six months
[36:57] when we're all supposed to be in the
[36:59] body of Christ
[37:01] if you notice I don't stop with one
[37:03] person
[37:05] you know what it is most pastors or
[37:07] preachers go out and get a little group
[37:08] you know I'll go around and Shake Hands
[37:11] whenever one of you if I don't shake
[37:12] your hand on Sunday it's not my fault
[37:16] it's yours because you you didn't hang
[37:19] around long enough for me to do that
[37:21] because I want to be friends to
[37:23] everybody because that way I want
[37:25] everybody to be friends to me
[37:26] whether it be little kids big kids or or
[37:29] whatever it be that it did it be that
[37:32] way
[37:33] all right so just make everything and
[37:36] get all of your playing together in the
[37:37] right and and Don't Leave Nobody out
[37:40] and you know of your playings and your
[37:43] doings have a good time together
[37:45] and fellowship together and make it to
[37:47] be that way now I'm going to go ahead
[37:49] and mention this part too because it's
[37:51] been mentioned to me about the youth
[37:53] camps
[37:54] all right
[37:56] I've had
[37:58] bad taste about youth camps that I don't
[38:01] like
[38:02] and for some reasons you know things
[38:06] but the church will pay
[38:09] for your children the child's
[38:12] registration fee
[38:15] for them to go to Youth Camp
[38:18] but it won't pay for no adults to go to
[38:21] carry them
[38:23] because that would be derogatory to some
[38:26] of the others that can't go that would
[38:28] like to go and to do so we just don't do
[38:31] it but I said now if you you take your
[38:34] child to you camp it's your
[38:36] responsibility
[38:37] to get them there back home into doings
[38:40] it's not our responsibility we take no
[38:43] responsibility whatsoever for your child
[38:47] if you don't want them to go to the
[38:49] youth camps that's fine
[38:51] if you want them to go I'll say it again
[38:53] and keep saying it we will pay the
[38:55] tuition fee or what it costs you know
[38:57] the child to go and do we'll pay that
[39:01] but we won't pay for somebody else to
[39:03] take them because if we pay for somebody
[39:06] to take them we're responsible
[39:08] the church van is set up to where
[39:11] there's only certain ones in the church
[39:12] can drive it and the reason is because
[39:15] of the insurance
[39:17] if you would be willing to go and do
[39:21] something you might get on the insurance
[39:22] but you know what you got to go you got
[39:24] to go to two days of a
[39:27] driver's education
[39:30] you got to have two days of it before
[39:32] you can qualify or either linked and
[39:35] they do the insurance kind of allows the
[39:38] CDL license
[39:40] they allow that part because that's the
[39:42] doings but adults see it's it's just not
[39:46] a it's not a whole bunch can drive the
[39:48] van so we can't say well we're going to
[39:50] send a van to Youth Camp because that
[39:52] way we're going to be taking your
[39:53] responsibility
[39:55] you take your kids do what you want to
[39:57] take them to you count do the things
[40:00] we'll pay for the tuition but not your
[40:03] not your expenses for Mom and Daddy to
[40:05] go or anybody else to go
[40:07] we'll pay just for the kids tuition and
[40:10] then that way if they go you come to us
[40:13] we'll give you the money for paying for
[40:15] that but we will not pay for anybody to
[40:18] go and you know drop off your kids and
[40:21] go somewhere and visit with somebody
[40:23] else because that doesn't
[40:26] that are lazy I swear I'm against some
[40:29] of the youth camps
[40:31] now if I ever did run you if I ever have
[40:33] anything to do with youth counts which
[40:34] we did all right we had adults
[40:39] that were supposed to go along
[40:41] and sometimes they didn't do it and they
[40:43] got
[40:44] put off of it from me as to not do it
[40:46] anymore because they didn't go and do
[40:49] the order the way I said it
[40:52] I said go there be a director be a youth
[40:56] counselor be in with our children
[40:59] and make sure they behave themselves and
[41:02] and do a woman with the girls band with
[41:05] the boys all right you know like that so
[41:08] we we tried to do those things but to
[41:11] just solve the problem of
[41:13] any situations if you want to take your
[41:16] kids to Youth Camp you feel free to do
[41:18] that's up to you but we won't pay for
[41:21] nothing other than the child itself
[41:23] that's the registration will fee all
[41:26] right then that way whatever you do if
[41:29] you're taking them there and dropping
[41:30] them off that's your responsibility
[41:33] I would be very careful about
[41:36] the youth camps
[41:38] you know
[41:39] and all like that
[41:41] because they can be problems happen
[41:46] and you can't correct it like I was
[41:47] talking about a while ago you run around
[41:48] here with a stick or you get out here
[41:50] kids a lot of times we'll be down adults
[41:53] will be under the outside thing and the
[41:55] kids some of you older
[41:58] boys and girls come running through well
[42:00] don't do that you can hurt somebody
[42:04] you can knock down one of these little
[42:05] bitty kids
[42:07] and you knock somebody down well it
[42:09] wasn't my fault
[42:10] it is if you're running out there when
[42:13] you're not
[42:14] and you could knock somebody lose an
[42:15] eyelid and make a arm broken you could
[42:18] and it'll never be repaired
[42:22] so just don't do it don't come down you
[42:24] know we used to we had the little kids
[42:25] they would ride their little wheel I
[42:27] made a Mark and I said don't bring that
[42:29] little stroller really you're riding in
[42:32] no further than right here because
[42:34] adults was out there
[42:36] walking around
[42:38] you know you try to be safe
[42:41] it's a whole lot better to be safe than
[42:43] it is sorry
[42:45] a couple of Fellers here one time
[42:46] throwed some rocks
[42:48] and then up a car
[42:52] and you know what they paid for the car
[42:54] to be fixed
[42:58] so
[42:59] if I was your mom's and dads and I told
[43:02] you not to do it
[43:04] you know I said don't do them things now
[43:06] brother Dale's instructed if I was your
[43:08] daddy and and you went out there and
[43:10] throw the rock or throw the ball and you
[43:13] know accidents can happen but if you do
[43:15] the wrong
[43:16] uh you'd pay for it
[43:20] your allowance would be taken care of
[43:22] to make you pay for heart
[43:25] you know because you're told not to do
[43:27] it try to be nice try to be Christians
[43:30] about everything have a good time
[43:33] hey we don't go off you know brother
[43:35] Dale don't holler and scream about all
[43:37] these things like these other churches
[43:38] do hey come on folks
[43:41] you're older ones I don't like what the
[43:44] kids are doing today
[43:47] you had your ducktail haircuts and bell
[43:51] bottom pants
[43:54] right
[43:57] you had your day
[44:00] and the things that was done in your day
[44:02] would you and my day was just like the
[44:05] things that kids are doing now
[44:07] you know
[44:09] I have more trouble out of adults than I
[44:11] do kids because kids generally
[44:13] understand me all right but okay
[44:17] try to keep that right or that you're
[44:19] not playing rough you respect each other
[44:22] on the playgrounds and things and you
[44:25] you kind of stay to where you're
[44:27] supposed to be the bigger kids for the
[44:29] bigger kids you know and the little ones
[44:31] were the little ones and the the doings
[44:33] and and not be throwing off on things
[44:35] and don't be throwing off on somebody
[44:38] else please don't that's not that's not
[44:41] even good scent let alone Christianity
[44:44] Christianity doesn't make light of
[44:46] anybody
[44:48] you know I went to school one of you
[44:51] kids had never been there
[44:53] my brother
[44:55] when he was in school they knew every
[44:57] day when he was walking down the hall
[45:00] because they took my daddy's shoes and
[45:03] cut the toes off and left him and I've
[45:06] got the old wood or the old metal thing
[45:08] that you laid the shoe on you know to
[45:10] beat it down I've got that of my daddy's
[45:12] and you know and they could hear him
[45:15] coming down the hall because he didn't
[45:17] have nothing but a big old heel and a
[45:19] little short thing on the front
[45:21] but we was poor
[45:24] you know sometimes people can't afford
[45:26] fancy clothes like others don't make fun
[45:29] of nobody because they can't
[45:31] you know no no don't do that don't make
[45:33] lie to nobody about anything
[45:37] respect everybody is a person
[45:40] I've always been able when I worked at
[45:42] General Motors I worked with a lot of
[45:45] people that that was the first years
[45:46] that we had the mixed races into the
[45:49] black people coming in working it at
[45:51] General Motors you know and all I never
[45:53] had no trouble with any of them because
[45:55] I believe everybody's a human being
[45:58] right they don't matter about the color
[45:59] of your skin you can't help but color
[46:01] your skin
[46:03] you can't help it be another way but you
[46:05] can hit what you do
[46:07] you can help about all the other things
[46:09] you know trying to be bigger than or
[46:11] better than somebody else just be
[46:13] yourself all right
[46:15] and let it be nice and kind okay a lot
[46:19] of things I guess we should cover but
[46:21] just remember
[46:23] what we've said
[46:25] you know let it be a Christian attitude
[46:29] not making fun of somebody else
[46:32] because the minute you make fun of
[46:34] somebody else
[46:35] the devil is going to have somebody make
[46:39] fun of you and you're going to find it
[46:41] out
[46:43] and but it'll be too late it's the best
[46:45] thing to do is just don't do it start
[46:46] with
[46:49] don't be in any way adults children or
[46:52] whatever don't make fun of nobody
[46:53] because of their raisins and their
[46:56] doings and their clothes and their
[46:58] things just don't do it
[47:01] if not a good Christian attitude
[47:04] we'll just have a good time okay all
[47:06] right take that as from Brother Dale and
[47:09] just remember that we're trying to be a
[47:12] group of Christians living for Christ
[47:15] and trying to win people instead of
[47:18] running them off
[47:20] and that way then you can do it all
[47:23] right now
[47:25] we left off this morning so we'll try to
[47:28] pick up part of the morning's message
[47:31] and continue on into what we're talking
[47:35] about but what was the point we were
[47:38] talking about this morning that I kept
[47:40] emphasizing and I want to keep on
[47:42] emphasizing that point to you that
[47:46] the new birth
[47:49] the prophet said you need the new birth
[47:50] more than anything in the world
[47:52] all right
[47:54] because you don't have the new birth
[47:55] you're not born again
[47:57] if you don't have the new birth you're
[47:59] not going to be in heaven as the bride
[48:01] of Christ
[48:03] you're not going to be in those things
[48:05] you're going to be left out because you
[48:07] won't do it
[48:09] all right
[48:10] in that new birth
[48:13] as we will cover review a little bit
[48:16] we saw that it does not take place in
[48:19] the body
[48:21] it does not take place in the spirit so
[48:25] that would do away with all of your
[48:27] things that you would try to depend upon
[48:29] as to call it your salvation and you
[48:33] know that I'm right that you you ask
[48:34] most people uh are you born again and
[48:37] they'll they'll tell you know like and
[48:40] then we kind of Life at the the one
[48:42] where brother random said you know they
[48:43] said well something about are you a
[48:45] Christian said I'll have you know I burn
[48:46] a can to live or not
[48:48] we'll see with life and say well what
[48:51] has that got to do with it
[48:53] but you know what somebody else is
[48:54] looking down on down the road to you to
[48:57] look at it and you say well you know are
[48:59] you a Christian I speak in tongues
[49:02] right well somebody's looking down at
[49:05] that and saying that ain't right
[49:06] because you can do that every day your
[49:08] life will still be lost
[49:09] well I believe the message
[49:14] now there is a certain point there that
[49:16] is true if you really believed
[49:20] there wouldn't be any problem
[49:24] we'll have to cover that that Lord
[49:25] believe is about that long
[49:28] because it starts from just a knowledge
[49:32] and goes all the way to
[49:35] or even who job would say I know
[49:39] he didn't say I think or hope so I know
[49:42] My Redeemer liveth all right
[49:45] but see that new birth takes place in
[49:47] the soul not in the body in the spirit
[49:51] what you do outwardly of anything you
[49:54] can call it
[49:55] speaking in tongues shouting crying you
[49:58] know and brother Brown said the living
[50:00] we read this morning people living even
[50:03] a Christian Life he said
[50:08] you know living good doing good loving
[50:10] the Lord because he don't love the Lord
[50:12] with your body
[50:16] all right
[50:17] you love the Lord with your spirit
[50:20] because your soul is either one of the
[50:22] two it would be love or it would be hate
[50:26] because it has to be one of the two it's
[50:28] either God or the devil
[50:30] right
[50:32] so really the love that we're interested
[50:34] in and the thoughts is dealing with the
[50:36] realm that we call the spirit realm of
[50:38] mankind the second realm of mankind
[50:42] which is memory reason conscience
[50:46] affections things all right
[50:49] and you can do every bit of that go to
[50:51] church all of your life see we didn't
[50:53] know that years ago did we
[50:56] we never heard that taught in an
[50:58] organizational religion
[51:01] we could hear certain things but not
[51:04] like that
[51:06] the
[51:08] it's not that form because when the
[51:11] prophet came I'll read I think it was in
[51:14] this morning or I'll read it this
[51:15] evening he said and you say you believe
[51:18] me as a prophet
[51:21] in other words he said why don't you
[51:22] listen to what I'm saying right if you
[51:26] say you believe in the prophet listen to
[51:27] what he says
[51:28] uh because that's the only way that we
[51:32] can can handle it all right
[51:34] you see you could be anointed on your
[51:37] spirit
[51:39] with the genuine
[51:41] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[51:45] now I may hit it this afternoon but I
[51:49] would advise you to listen for a few
[51:51] services this is not just a six and
[51:54] seven message of you must be born again
[51:59] I warn you
[52:01] this message has cost me a lot
[52:04] in sleep and everything else
[52:07] because there's a lot of things that I
[52:09] know I'm responsible for explaining
[52:13] right because somewhere it's got to be
[52:15] explained
[52:17] for us to understand it I just believe
[52:19] it
[52:22] what do you believe
[52:25] you know
[52:26] what do you believe
[52:28] you know we really didn't know what we
[52:30] believed until the prophet came right
[52:34] we thought we believe a lot of things
[52:37] you know
[52:38] but it's kind of like brother Adam said
[52:41] he said I used to think that Jesus loved
[52:43] me and God hated me
[52:45] now he was honest enough to say it
[52:48] but he said I found out it was self-sane
[52:50] person
[52:51] you know all right
[52:53] but see the new birth cannot take place
[52:55] in your body because the body without
[52:58] the spirit is dead and if New Birth took
[53:00] place there then it wouldn't matter
[53:01] about the spirit of whatever if it took
[53:04] place in the body all right then it
[53:06] cannot take place in the spirit Realm
[53:09] because then Satan can be there
[53:14] all right now remember he is in the soul
[53:19] of us as
[53:21] the nature
[53:23] away
[53:24] you know
[53:27] until we're born again
[53:29] but then when we're born again he's not
[53:31] there anymore
[53:33] because he can't do it and God won't
[53:34] dwell in an unclean vessel
[53:36] so don't think that is that it's God and
[53:39] the devil in there together
[53:41] now when brother Branham explained it he
[53:44] didn't put it that way he said in me now
[53:47] is too
[53:48] dog white dog black dog
[53:51] all right that don't mean the devil is
[53:54] in your soul
[53:56] that's one thing I've taught from the
[53:58] beginning with you
[54:00] that the devil can't be in your soul at
[54:02] the same time God's there that won't
[54:04] work
[54:05] all right because that would that would
[54:07] mess up the entire Bible
[54:09] all right
[54:11] now
[54:12] I say this because somebody on the tape
[54:14] could click on
[54:17] we are using the points of what the
[54:19] prophet is going to be saying
[54:22] in the opening of the word in the bases
[54:25] that he would talk about body
[54:28] spirit and soul
[54:31] when is his early Ministry
[54:34] he would interrelate that sometimes and
[54:37] make it bring it that way but the basics
[54:39] he would bring it as body
[54:43] Soul and Spirit
[54:45] all right but he didn't have to correct
[54:47] it
[54:49] because he wasn't wrong in the senses of
[54:52] that
[54:53] he always gave the bodies he takes feel
[54:56] smell in your he always gave the second
[54:58] Rim whether he called it Soul or Spirit
[55:00] or being or what it was always memory
[55:04] reason conscience and affection
[55:07] all right and he always gave the center
[55:10] him
[55:12] one cents either Faith or doubt
[55:16] either God or the devil you know he
[55:19] always kept it lined up so he didn't
[55:21] have to be come back well I don't know
[55:23] where he corrected that at
[55:28] going over after the opening of the
[55:31] seals and just read and you'll find out
[55:33] and then in no way am I saying was he
[55:35] wrong back there that's what I'm saying
[55:39] maybe it was left to Blind a lot of
[55:41] people because a lot of your doctrines
[55:44] are based upon
[55:45] the early Ministry
[55:47] and not understanding the getting
[55:49] together to me
[55:53] I believe he was a prophet in the old
[55:54] you know the early Ministry needs a
[55:57] prophet in the later Ministry but I
[55:59] believe the word opened to the prophet
[56:03] I believe as he progressed the word open
[56:05] into it that would be Hebrews 4 12.
[56:09] see and that would be I believe that's
[56:11] right where it says it it it brings it
[56:14] to the point of dividing Soul and Spirit
[56:17] joint and Mara
[56:19] all right the scripture then would be
[56:21] correct because in no way you could you
[56:23] say the spirit that sinneth it shall die
[56:26] the Bible don't say that
[56:27] the Bible says the soul that Sinners
[56:29] shall die
[56:30] all right we need to deal a lot about
[56:32] this Spirit Realm
[56:35] to think about it
[56:37] as to be in the bases that were Satan
[56:40] has his greatest uh hand
[56:44] into or dwells the most
[56:51] and don't ever think as the prophet said
[56:53] that any way that we are any of us a
[56:55] match for the devil
[56:58] just just get that plane yeah there's no
[57:01] way for us to be the match for the devil
[57:03] now the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[57:06] match for the devil
[57:08] but you've got to admit a lot of times
[57:09] we don't yield to that
[57:12] if you don't you're going to find it out
[57:14] you know eventually
[57:17] but see we say God tells us this and God
[57:20] tells us that
[57:23] right right
[57:26] and see then that way we base everything
[57:28] upon something that we believe
[57:34] as to be what God does
[57:37] well what if that's not true
[57:42] you know what if it's the devil it was
[57:43] telling us that
[57:46] and what even as it we were covering
[57:49] there in one service
[57:51] what even if it
[57:56] if it'll come among you to try you to
[57:58] see whether or not you will stay with
[58:00] the truth
[58:03] right
[58:06] see then you got to go back to the word
[58:07] you can't go nowhere else will have been
[58:09] around to that right because you know
[58:10] what I believe what is the new birth
[58:12] brother Dale it's the word revealed
[58:16] to you personally
[58:18] right
[58:20] because it can't be anything else
[58:22] it can't be shouting speaking in tongues
[58:24] crime all them things is good
[58:28] but the new birth takes place in the
[58:30] soul of man and then outwardly
[58:33] the spirit displaced what's in the soul
[58:36] and the the body displays what the
[58:39] spirit is doing
[58:41] all right
[58:43] but the main thing is that inside
[58:47] of the inside
[58:49] now that's what we're going to be
[58:50] talking about a little bit when we get
[58:52] down to it in a minute but I want you to
[58:55] to just think about it and we're going
[58:57] to drop back to the morning message pick
[58:59] up number seven brothers which will be
[59:01] coming from the future home
[59:05] all right
[59:06] and I want us to read this
[59:10] because to me it's a wonderful
[59:13] expression of Truth
[59:17] and to me it takes out a lot of
[59:19] of ideas and things that people has had
[59:25] you know they're saying now and the
[59:27] people of the message are saying well uh
[59:30] the new birth now just the baptism
[59:35] well you can have that on your spirit
[59:36] and die and go to hell now all you got
[59:39] oh but you don't understand what we're
[59:41] talking about baptism I agree with you I
[59:43] don't understand what you're talking
[59:44] about on baptism
[59:46] I mean I agree with you no problem
[59:49] because to me baptism is baptism
[59:52] one of these days I'm going to show you
[59:54] or to preach to you what I believe the
[59:57] new birth is
[59:59] I haven't preached it
[1:00:01] in 40 something years
[1:00:06] there's been a secret was left there
[1:00:08] that I couldn't explain
[1:00:13] and there's still a lot of things I
[1:00:14] can't explain
[1:00:18] but I wait on him
[1:00:20] all right go look what he says
[1:00:25] he said first time Christ ever dealt
[1:00:28] with me coming down such a boy
[1:00:31] I've always taught those three stages of
[1:00:34] Grace
[1:00:35] absolutely
[1:00:37] now why is it now that they're saying
[1:00:40] that he taught different stages
[1:00:41] different things
[1:00:44] it means they don't they're not saying
[1:00:46] he's the prophet
[1:00:48] see he's always taught three processes
[1:00:51] this is 19 and 64. I mean
[1:00:56] to you that believe you'd believe after
[1:00:58] the seals but not before
[1:01:00] but just remember that point
[1:01:04] and look what he says now and I love
[1:01:06] this because to me it explains my
[1:01:09] Christian Journey
[1:01:14] it explains my new birth
[1:01:17] and what took place
[1:01:18] to me
[1:01:20] so if nothing else buy with me reading
[1:01:22] what took place to me
[1:01:27] I mean
[1:01:28] you may have got this
[1:01:31] boy you just jumped right up just
[1:01:33] promote got everything I'm not saying
[1:01:35] you didn't
[1:01:37] but I am saying one time
[1:01:40] if you have the new birth
[1:01:45] you had to come through
[1:01:48] three stages
[1:01:50] to get it
[1:01:53] now he's going to explain those three
[1:01:55] stages justification sanctification the
[1:01:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:01] he said well brother Dale
[1:02:03] you've always told us that when you came
[1:02:05] into the message that you had been a
[1:02:07] Baptist a deacon and all kind of things
[1:02:10] and teachers of all but said you found
[1:02:13] out you weren't born again
[1:02:18] well you know what this is the way I
[1:02:19] found it out
[1:02:22] I found it out by reading a man talking
[1:02:25] about an experience
[1:02:27] and just remember brother random says
[1:02:29] one of the Mysteries is to receive the
[1:02:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost without a
[1:02:33] sensation but he never said
[1:02:36] to have a new birth or anything without
[1:02:39] an experience
[1:02:41] an experience is something you live
[1:02:43] through a sensation is a stimulation
[1:02:45] upon your flesh out through from your
[1:02:48] spirit Realm
[1:02:50] right
[1:02:52] so then listen
[1:02:54] and see if this what happened to you and
[1:02:56] maybe you'd say well
[1:02:58] I don't remember that happening to me
[1:03:01] well maybe you you need to
[1:03:04] follow the channel and let that happen
[1:03:08] right
[1:03:10] right
[1:03:13] I mentioned one time not too long ago
[1:03:15] and I got one person to agree
[1:03:18] that what if I come out here one day and
[1:03:20] said I think that everybody in here
[1:03:23] order to get baptized again
[1:03:29] I said 90 98 of the people that say I
[1:03:32] was baptized rights start with and I
[1:03:34] don't need to get baptized again
[1:03:39] but what is it is it if you do
[1:03:41] I've baptized a lot of people that was
[1:03:43] baptized
[1:03:45] correctly
[1:03:47] because they come and said I didn't
[1:03:49] understand I didn't know I didn't follow
[1:03:52] that
[1:03:55] okay
[1:03:58] you see
[1:04:00] you blessed God I've been baptized
[1:04:02] correctly
[1:04:04] now why are you getting upset
[1:04:08] right
[1:04:10] I ain't why are you getting all boiled
[1:04:14] over about something well you decide to
[1:04:16] get us to do something again
[1:04:19] I've been baptized three times
[1:04:22] one time in a river right down here
[1:04:26] well I would have got to the new bridge
[1:04:27] it kills for
[1:04:29] father son the Holy Ghost
[1:04:31] good old Baptist
[1:04:34] went back and heard of this message and
[1:04:37] we were planning to go over there and
[1:04:39] they used to have a lot of baptisms at
[1:04:41] that Creek because the day we were
[1:04:43] planning to go back the best I remember
[1:04:45] there were two Church groups standing in
[1:04:48] line waiting to baptize at that River
[1:04:50] that's the best I can remember it now
[1:04:53] and remote said well what we're going to
[1:04:55] do I said I I don't have to be baptized
[1:04:57] in the same water called don't mind no
[1:04:58] dear but I said I do want to know where
[1:05:00] that same water runs good and deep
[1:05:03] until we drove back up a quarter of a
[1:05:05] mile turn and went down in the woods
[1:05:06] went to the same Creek
[1:05:08] I got baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:05:09] Jesus Christ
[1:05:11] we went to Israel
[1:05:14] and out of 26 I believe it was 24
[1:05:16] probably Believers of the message
[1:05:18] my wife and I and Brother Dean and
[1:05:20] sister Peggy Gibby
[1:05:22] we were the only four that got baptized
[1:05:25] in the River Jordan
[1:05:27] got a lot of them said I've been
[1:05:28] baptized correctly I don't what are
[1:05:30] y'all getting baptized again for I said
[1:05:32] if I come back again I'll do it again
[1:05:38] don't bother me
[1:05:41] I ain't denying nothing I love it
[1:05:44] I'm kind of like old brother Willie Ross
[1:05:46] and I heard him telling and most of you
[1:05:48] remember him but he said he went up to
[1:05:50] Jeff the first time and I believe it was
[1:05:51] brother Solomon was with him and they
[1:05:54] had said something about getting
[1:05:55] baptized and they had been baptized
[1:05:57] correctly he said oh he said no Willie
[1:05:59] Willie said now now Solomon you just
[1:06:01] keep your mouth shut we're going to get
[1:06:02] some more of this
[1:06:04] because they wanted to be baptized again
[1:06:06] all right but you see
[1:06:09] but get back to the story
[1:06:12] he said he'd always talked three stages
[1:06:14] of Grace well now anything you read
[1:06:19] anywhere
[1:06:22] if that statement is correct then line
[1:06:24] it up to that statement
[1:06:28] and then now he's going to explain this
[1:06:30] three stages
[1:06:34] that way you'll keep it correct now
[1:06:37] watch it starts then
[1:06:39] he says now the first step is repentance
[1:06:41] towards God
[1:06:43] then followers after that is water
[1:06:45] baptism
[1:06:47] water baptism repent and be baptized in
[1:06:49] the name of Jesus Christ see water
[1:06:52] baptism followers showing that
[1:06:55] repentance was genuine
[1:06:58] well when I found out I was baptized
[1:07:00] wrong I didn't have any trouble saying I
[1:07:04] want to make it right
[1:07:06] right because I wanted it to be and then
[1:07:09] I found out the name and all the things
[1:07:12] but watch what he says
[1:07:14] showing that the repentance was genuine
[1:07:17] now you can talk people into a lot of
[1:07:20] things
[1:07:23] and I believe that's what happens to a
[1:07:25] lot of people
[1:07:26] and it's not a genuine repentance now
[1:07:29] because see we could spend days on this
[1:07:32] teaching see you don't want a genuine
[1:07:33] repentance is
[1:07:35] the Bible says
[1:07:37] the goodness of God
[1:07:41] leadeth thee to repentance
[1:07:46] right
[1:07:48] the Bible says
[1:07:51] no one can come to the father but by me
[1:07:55] is that what Jesus said
[1:07:57] if I misphrase just to hire you put it
[1:08:00] right in order
[1:08:02] but it's pretty close to the scripture
[1:08:05] see nobody can come unless they're
[1:08:07] called
[1:08:09] but then we've got another scripture
[1:08:10] that many are called and what
[1:08:13] few are chosen
[1:08:16] now we're still in the Bible
[1:08:18] all right she's showing that you're
[1:08:20] genuine in other words genuine
[1:08:22] repentance
[1:08:24] it means you realize that you were wrong
[1:08:29] and you're sorry for that
[1:08:33] right now words are cheap until you go
[1:08:35] to a lawyer
[1:08:36] it's going to cost too far out of you
[1:08:39] but words are cheap
[1:08:41] I'm sorry
[1:08:45] well
[1:08:47] now we keep going back and doing things
[1:08:48] over and over again I'm saying I'm sorry
[1:08:51] it don't work too good
[1:08:53] right
[1:08:55] okay
[1:08:57] showing that repentance was genuine are
[1:09:00] to remit our past sins that has nothing
[1:09:04] to do with the future now we know for a
[1:09:06] certainty that water baptism does not
[1:09:09] remit
[1:09:11] so he's not explaining of a remittance
[1:09:14] of sin
[1:09:16] right here is where it's remitted
[1:09:19] it's remitted at genuine repentance
[1:09:26] we'll get to that if we get to Ezekiel
[1:09:28] if we don't we'll have it later where it
[1:09:30] talks about a new heart
[1:09:33] I'll take away your Stony heart
[1:09:36] well we didn't get no heart transplant
[1:09:40] right right
[1:09:43] all right
[1:09:45] you see art to remember our past in
[1:09:47] other words it showed our past are gone
[1:09:49] not the baptism the repentance shows are
[1:09:52] doing but the remittance and following
[1:09:55] the baptism shows that my remittance my
[1:09:58] sincerity of being genuine
[1:10:03] that's what's remitting my sins
[1:10:06] all right
[1:10:07] see there's nothing to do with your
[1:10:09] future sins so justification chops off
[1:10:12] your pie sins
[1:10:16] has nothing to do with your future
[1:10:19] you're still just as lost as can be
[1:10:22] other than your repentance and your
[1:10:25] believing
[1:10:27] you might qualify for a foolish virgin
[1:10:30] that's between God and you
[1:10:34] but that's it don't have nothing to do
[1:10:35] see it only remits repent and be
[1:10:38] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:10:39] what for remission now there's another
[1:10:42] word
[1:10:43] remission because showing that it's
[1:10:45] written what taking away the past sin
[1:10:48] has nothing to do with the future
[1:10:51] just your sins have been chopped off
[1:10:54] what you did
[1:10:56] you can't repent for what Adam done you
[1:10:59] never done it Adam did you just get
[1:11:02] forgiveness for what you've done the old
[1:11:05] nature is still there
[1:11:09] all right
[1:11:11] now you can argue the point
[1:11:13] of back in Luther's day and how that
[1:11:16] much they got it but
[1:11:18] around and said Luther got the new birth
[1:11:21] I just found that one the other day
[1:11:24] I'd always known it where he said the
[1:11:25] new birth of Wesley under sanctification
[1:11:29] but he got Luther got the new birth but
[1:11:32] there wasn't as much required then as
[1:11:34] you are now
[1:11:35] but I believe Luther was required to
[1:11:37] repent
[1:11:39] and get things straight
[1:11:42] all right
[1:11:43] now watch what he says then he goes up
[1:11:45] and he makes a board and he illustrates
[1:11:47] on the Blackboard and here is a human
[1:11:49] heart
[1:11:51] and here is a human heart
[1:11:53] now I'm as honest as I can be this is
[1:11:57] what I believe
[1:11:58] that's not two hearts
[1:12:01] that's the same heart
[1:12:04] but it's showing the stages of the heart
[1:12:07] you don't make it two people that's fine
[1:12:09] I could one person over here got this
[1:12:10] one person got this what if you're gonna
[1:12:12] make it down to one person
[1:12:16] bring it down to think about what
[1:12:18] happens
[1:12:19] and you'll see a beautiful picture all
[1:12:21] right now this one over here has a snake
[1:12:24] in it
[1:12:25] that sin so he drawed it out in a little
[1:12:27] line draw and in the snake you know
[1:12:31] here he has his life
[1:12:33] that's the center part
[1:12:36] all right
[1:12:38] this one over here has a dove in it
[1:12:40] which is the Holy Spirit
[1:12:42] here he has a life well this one here
[1:12:46] ain't going back he has malice hatred
[1:12:49] Envy that's what's
[1:12:52] causing it
[1:12:53] is this fella here
[1:12:55] something inside of theirs causing him
[1:12:58] inside of that drawing he made of a
[1:13:00] heart is causing these things to have
[1:13:03] hatred in and out this one over here has
[1:13:05] love and joy and long suffering that's
[1:13:08] what does it down here
[1:13:11] and when you are asked are you are
[1:13:15] forgiven of your sins you only done this
[1:13:18] taken that away so you can take if you
[1:13:21] drawed it out with a snake
[1:13:23] and you draw the little squiggly lines
[1:13:25] to represent sin
[1:13:28] and then you drawed the inside core of
[1:13:30] the person
[1:13:32] now he says what you've done is you risk
[1:13:34] release them since
[1:13:37] see when you repent of your sins that's
[1:13:39] your past
[1:13:42] you can't repent of your future
[1:13:45] you have to wait until that comes
[1:13:47] we're not Catholicism in trying to be
[1:13:50] penance
[1:13:52] no
[1:13:53] you can't get forgiven of something you
[1:13:55] ain't done yet
[1:13:57] right well you do it that's forgiveness
[1:14:01] For Heaven's Sake don't try to be on
[1:14:03] what they're saying Lord help me I'm
[1:14:05] going to go do it
[1:14:06] no that won't work
[1:14:09] and watch
[1:14:12] you only done
[1:14:14] only done this taking that away but the
[1:14:18] thing that made you do it is still there
[1:14:23] okay
[1:14:25] that's the old root of evil
[1:14:28] it's still there notice
[1:14:31] now brother Jesus said the unclean
[1:14:34] Spirit goeth out of the man he's talking
[1:14:35] about the root of evil and brother Brown
[1:14:37] says that the unclean Spirit goes out at
[1:14:40] sanctification so that's solving the
[1:14:42] problem
[1:14:43] noticed in your repent and are baptized
[1:14:46] in the name of Jesus Christ that he
[1:14:48] forgave you of your sins notice then
[1:14:51] secretly comes sanctification which sets
[1:14:54] our mind in order for Holiness to think
[1:14:57] right now remember this morning we were
[1:14:58] explaining the jar in the yard you pick
[1:15:01] it up you got a reason for doing it you
[1:15:03] don't go put every stuff in it you take
[1:15:05] it in the house and you wash it real
[1:15:06] good then you go put something in it
[1:15:09] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:15:11] the Holy Ghost all right
[1:15:13] secondly comes sanctification which sets
[1:15:15] our mind in order for wholeness to think
[1:15:17] right take away sanctification is a
[1:15:20] compound word now don't confuse this
[1:15:24] mind with the mind of Christ and don't
[1:15:28] worry about making the mind too much in
[1:15:30] relation because your memory reason
[1:15:32] conscious and affection does work
[1:15:34] through your mind
[1:15:35] right
[1:15:37] all right sanctification is a compound
[1:15:40] Greek word which means cleanse and set
[1:15:41] aside for service the next comes the
[1:15:43] baptism of fire and I love that
[1:15:47] I love it greatly because
[1:15:50] when we get around to some of the other
[1:15:52] things a prophets this Prophet has said
[1:15:56] that is going to become a very valuable
[1:15:59] scripture
[1:16:02] because the Bible says the baptism of
[1:16:03] the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:16:06] so he brought around and says baptism of
[1:16:08] fire and Holy Ghost the Bible says
[1:16:09] baptism beholders and Fire
[1:16:12] it's going to be needful when we get up
[1:16:14] there talking about it so I would hold
[1:16:17] on to that
[1:16:18] see that God might dwell in us and the
[1:16:20] fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin
[1:16:23] and puts the Holy Ghost Inside
[1:16:26] then we bring forth the same life that
[1:16:28] this did because
[1:16:30] that's in us now watch what he's saying
[1:16:33] throw it back down pull it pull it back
[1:16:36] down just a little bit
[1:16:37] all right
[1:16:41] cleansed our heart from sin and puts the
[1:16:43] Holy Ghost Inside then we bring forth
[1:16:46] the same life that this did all right
[1:16:52] that Holy Ghost
[1:16:54] is the life of God
[1:16:58] coming into you
[1:17:04] now ask you a question
[1:17:09] how can God be in you
[1:17:17] you must consider this valuable
[1:17:20] to think about
[1:17:23] how can God get into you into your soul
[1:17:31] leave the point with you the way on down
[1:17:33] the road
[1:17:34] maybe next weekend if we get there
[1:17:37] but watch roll it up we keep on reading
[1:17:40] a little bit because he goes through the
[1:17:41] spirit and the the woman gives a birth
[1:17:44] into natural birth type of the spiritual
[1:17:45] birth the baby is born into the kingdom
[1:17:47] of God he comes the same way water blood
[1:17:49] spirit now notice sanctification the
[1:17:52] third stage now watch him second stage
[1:17:54] of it cleanses the Mind sets the heart
[1:17:56] the mind of the heart in order of
[1:17:59] Holiness mind of the heart
[1:18:04] brain dumping gizzard
[1:18:07] oh no no not exactly
[1:18:09] because that ain't the things he's
[1:18:11] working on
[1:18:12] a man can repent of sins
[1:18:15] and still thinking
[1:18:17] remember
[1:18:18] repentance does nothing to your future
[1:18:20] just the past
[1:18:22] well he's an immoral Manner and more
[1:18:25] looking every more looking immoral
[1:18:28] looking woman he finds is still dark
[1:18:30] maybe he's a drunkard every time he
[1:18:32] smells the drink it's still thirsty but
[1:18:35] when but then when he gets Sanctified
[1:18:38] that cleanses that desire out of him
[1:18:42] it takes a one of it away
[1:18:45] watch he can still be tempted
[1:18:48] but it takes a one of it away still he's
[1:18:50] not right yet
[1:18:52] then he is baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:18:54] and Fire
[1:18:56] cleanse burnout cleaned up and then put
[1:18:59] it into the service of God
[1:19:01] sanctification only sets them aside for
[1:19:03] service
[1:19:05] now I'll go ahead and drop a key when it
[1:19:09] says Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:19:14] that's not incorrect the way it's placed
[1:19:18] but you your mind
[1:19:21] tries to translate that is working
[1:19:24] and it looks like the Holy Ghost and the
[1:19:26] fire coming
[1:19:28] but just remember
[1:19:31] even though the unclean Spirit has gone
[1:19:33] out
[1:19:36] you're still not right yet
[1:19:39] and we will quote the Prophet this away
[1:19:42] there's telltale signs of Satan still
[1:19:45] left
[1:19:46] even though you've been sanctified
[1:19:51] amen because what do you got
[1:19:54] you can't go no further than the work
[1:19:55] that's been done
[1:19:58] who are you if the unclean Spirit has
[1:20:00] gone out
[1:20:03] you're a clean vessel
[1:20:06] but to make sure that's right
[1:20:09] the prophet says you do change it to
[1:20:12] hold it to Fire and Holy Ghost
[1:20:16] for your understanding that the fire
[1:20:18] cleanses everything that's left
[1:20:23] that's why there's not a lot of new
[1:20:24] births
[1:20:27] the in Samuel Dale
[1:20:29] it was supposed to take out all of those
[1:20:32] wrong things
[1:20:34] the fire is to burn it out
[1:20:38] now you see why that when
[1:20:41] I heard the truth
[1:20:44] I remember when I repented
[1:20:49] don't you I remember the things that we
[1:20:52] all talk about that a great load of sin
[1:20:54] went off of your shoulders and you
[1:20:57] become a different person
[1:21:00] but you know that and we'll quote
[1:21:02] brother random somewhere in a few
[1:21:03] minutes he said you see him turn around
[1:21:05] in a month from now and be gone
[1:21:10] well because there's nothing that holds
[1:21:12] you
[1:21:13] know
[1:21:16] I remember when the things of Life begin
[1:21:19] to come
[1:21:21] to a stage
[1:21:24] in me back in the Baptist
[1:21:27] that I wanted to get rid of those things
[1:21:31] but I had no one I could talk to about
[1:21:33] it
[1:21:34] because they they didn't understand my
[1:21:37] wordings and I don't understand that
[1:21:42] I tried to explain it to a lot of people
[1:21:44] that hey there's just still things wrong
[1:21:48] and I'd like to know why
[1:21:52] all right
[1:21:54] I'd like to know how come
[1:21:56] things were still working
[1:21:58] don't you right
[1:22:01] I like answers to questions
[1:22:05] and my question has been to you as the
[1:22:07] church is what
[1:22:10] if you are truly a born-again Christian
[1:22:12] sealed by the Holy Spirit
[1:22:17] truly have it now
[1:22:20] can you do something wrong who's doing
[1:22:22] the wrong
[1:22:26] you can't be the soul because it's
[1:22:28] eternal
[1:22:31] but it's got to be your spirit Realm
[1:22:33] you remember that we've been through
[1:22:35] this a long time
[1:22:37] talking about this sanctification it's
[1:22:40] the most dangerous stage that there is
[1:22:42] because that anointing can come up on
[1:22:45] you and you will think you're Christians
[1:22:47] you will go out and preach the gospel
[1:22:48] you'll go out and see the sick heel the
[1:22:51] dead raise the things Judas had part of
[1:22:53] the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:23:01] see it's very easy then to let those
[1:23:04] things get in your way I told a man one
[1:23:06] time talking to him I said your problem
[1:23:08] is you've got a gift
[1:23:14] and I know his gift work
[1:23:18] I don't have to explain nothing I just
[1:23:20] tell you all right I know his gift
[1:23:22] worked
[1:23:23] and works
[1:23:28] but I said that's your problem
[1:23:33] Brothers here can tell you about a
[1:23:34] certain brother
[1:23:36] that we all know not all of us but some
[1:23:39] of us know
[1:23:40] he can pray for the sick and they're
[1:23:42] healed
[1:23:43] and he's still smoking his pot and
[1:23:45] probably drinking everything or whatever
[1:23:48] it is
[1:23:50] and his problem is that you know what
[1:23:52] that he's looking at people who claim to
[1:23:55] be Christians that can't do what he's
[1:23:57] doing
[1:24:00] and he says God must love me more than
[1:24:02] he does you
[1:24:05] now you're going to argue with him
[1:24:09] hey he's got too many things stacked on
[1:24:11] his side
[1:24:12] you'd argue the point with him
[1:24:14] because he can pray for the sick and
[1:24:16] they're healed brother mode I remember
[1:24:18] that years ago I never will forget it
[1:24:20] that he was talking about this Russian
[1:24:22] monk that this guy was a
[1:24:25] head thing in Russia and every time that
[1:24:29] the man's boy had some kind of disease
[1:24:31] some of you that knowed brother mode a
[1:24:33] long time heard that story I'm sure and
[1:24:35] every time that baby would get violently
[1:24:37] sick with that he would call this guy up
[1:24:39] and the guy could be on a dance floor
[1:24:41] drunk as a coot
[1:24:44] stop get down and pray and God heal the
[1:24:47] child
[1:24:48] I believe it
[1:24:52] because that's gifts and callings
[1:24:54] without repentance
[1:24:57] you don't repent to get a gift you're
[1:25:00] either born with one or you don't get
[1:25:01] one you don't train for a gift
[1:25:06] you don't exercise something to make it
[1:25:08] a gift
[1:25:10] you either got one or don't got it
[1:25:13] not good English but it's the best way
[1:25:14] of saying it
[1:25:16] all right
[1:25:18] but what are you going to say to a
[1:25:19] person
[1:25:21] that they say but I've prayed for 10 12
[1:25:23] 15 people and they were healed how many
[1:25:25] of you ever prayed for and seen get
[1:25:27] healed they got you over a barrel if you
[1:25:30] don't know the truth
[1:25:33] because they're telling you a truth
[1:25:39] me well I just don't believe that
[1:25:42] happened I'm not going to argue that
[1:25:44] point that's what I told the brother I
[1:25:46] said your gift is your problem
[1:25:48] because
[1:25:50] you see things
[1:25:52] and maybe I don't see things like that
[1:25:55] well it can be a hindrance to you
[1:25:58] because you think you're greater
[1:26:01] into that point
[1:26:03] that's gifts
[1:26:04] that's what I was talking about this
[1:26:06] morning you can be Anointed with a
[1:26:08] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:11] signs and wonders take place
[1:26:14] and inside you're still lost
[1:26:18] that you tell me that's easy understood
[1:26:21] I'm going to tell you I don't believe so
[1:26:25] but when brother random began to explain
[1:26:27] those things
[1:26:31] I knew I didn't have what he's talking
[1:26:33] about
[1:26:35] my repentance was genuine I believe that
[1:26:39] my sanctification I didn't know to call
[1:26:42] it that or whatever it was back then but
[1:26:44] I
[1:26:46] you know get toward it I didn't care for
[1:26:48] those things
[1:26:49] and was trying to live a Christian Life
[1:26:52] to be honest and sincere you know and to
[1:26:55] do one illustration and it'll solve a
[1:26:58] lot of problems I sold a house one time
[1:27:00] and
[1:27:03] I made an agreement hand shook with my
[1:27:05] nephew and she Paige told me getting
[1:27:07] paid me or nothing just shook my hand
[1:27:09] and he said I said I'll take so many
[1:27:11] thousand dollars for the house they're
[1:27:12] in Guilds well he shook my hand I said
[1:27:14] it's yours
[1:27:16] a couple of days later my brother came
[1:27:18] to me and said I'll give you five
[1:27:19] thousand dollars profit
[1:27:22] that's a lot of money back in
[1:27:24] because that would have been 1971.
[1:27:27] to
[1:27:29] a lot of money still a lot of money to
[1:27:30] me might not be to you but it's still a
[1:27:32] lot to me
[1:27:34] he said uh
[1:27:36] I'll give you five thousand dollars
[1:27:37] profit I said no you don't understand
[1:27:38] it's done sold
[1:27:43] he said well what does that got to do
[1:27:44] with it you ain't signed no papers I
[1:27:46] said look my word is my bond
[1:27:49] it is sold
[1:27:52] you know what he even done he went and
[1:27:55] talked to my brother about it and
[1:27:56] brother's brother and he come back or
[1:27:59] told me later he said
[1:28:01] they said you're a dummy go ahead and do
[1:28:03] it and they'll divide it that's the one
[1:28:05] who sold it to go ahead and sell it to
[1:28:08] it and mean you at 225 2 500 a piece I
[1:28:13] said no your the house is yours
[1:28:18] that was the way I lived and have tried
[1:28:21] to live
[1:28:23] because I believe that away
[1:28:26] Richard was talking about a while ago
[1:28:27] going in the store and he could have
[1:28:29] walked away with about 150 worth of
[1:28:32] stuff and nobody could have done
[1:28:34] anything but he went back in and paid
[1:28:36] the people
[1:28:39] are you trying to live that honest and
[1:28:42] sincere
[1:28:43] had a lot to do with it all right
[1:28:46] but you see I believe my sanctification
[1:28:48] was good back there
[1:28:49] because you know what it brought me to
[1:28:51] this message
[1:28:55] my study
[1:28:57] and letting the word cleanse me and set
[1:28:59] me aside brought me to this message
[1:29:04] but then when the prophet began to talk
[1:29:06] about that baptism of the Holy Ghost not
[1:29:10] as a when he'd say it's not shouting
[1:29:12] it's not crying it's not doing it's none
[1:29:14] of these things
[1:29:17] he said it's the person of Jesus Christ
[1:29:20] coming living in you
[1:29:28] I got to admit there's something wrong
[1:29:34] you know when I began to seek God
[1:29:37] and for two years I sought him
[1:29:41] before I come to an experience that was
[1:29:44] satisfactory to me
[1:29:47] you know
[1:29:50] no I I can tell you great things happen
[1:29:53] in my experience
[1:29:56] but none of them do I count a new birth
[1:30:03] we'll get to them
[1:30:05] but look what he's saying
[1:30:07] first is repentance toward God
[1:30:10] followed into baptism do what it says
[1:30:13] sanctification
[1:30:18] sanctification cleansing you and set in
[1:30:20] your side
[1:30:21] the unclean Spirit going out
[1:30:24] that devil going out of that heart that
[1:30:26] I said is drawn for one with the devil
[1:30:29] in it and the other one with a dove in
[1:30:30] it just put them together and put the
[1:30:32] dove over in another
[1:30:34] you know I'm not her doctoral issue of a
[1:30:37] point trying to make a
[1:30:40] point
[1:30:42] see sanctification is to cleanse that
[1:30:44] desire out of you
[1:30:47] it takes the one of it away you can
[1:30:50] still be tempted but takes to one of it
[1:30:53] away
[1:30:54] you're still not right yet
[1:30:59] we'll try to drop over and pick up the
[1:31:01] evening message now okay
[1:31:04] you see questions and answers on the
[1:31:06] field 1963 paragraph 52. you see each
[1:31:10] one of those ages only taking a dip into
[1:31:12] the Holy Spirit
[1:31:14] justification is a work of the Holy
[1:31:17] Spirit
[1:31:18] sanctification is the work of the Holy
[1:31:21] Spirit
[1:31:23] but the baptism is the Holy Spirit
[1:31:28] amen that's why you can be justified and
[1:31:30] Sanctified and still be lost
[1:31:38] because the baptism is the Holy Spirit
[1:31:41] that comes into you
[1:31:44] and where does it work at it works in
[1:31:46] your soul
[1:31:48] you're not justified Sanctified and
[1:31:49] baptized with the Holy Ghost on your
[1:31:51] body or spirit
[1:31:52] I hope this has been enough for that to
[1:31:54] have gotten away from your thinking
[1:31:56] but to think about that the new birth is
[1:31:58] the birth of the Soul
[1:32:02] then
[1:32:05] the justifications and the thing work
[1:32:07] back out
[1:32:09] of that soul
[1:32:11] in through the body
[1:32:13] through the spirit
[1:32:14] and other people can see that
[1:32:18] you can deceive people
[1:32:21] right but you can't deceive God
[1:32:25] because it'll come to the right place
[1:32:26] and the one thing it'll come to you'll
[1:32:28] find this out eventually
[1:32:30] it'll come down to a basis one day that
[1:32:32] you're going to be dealing with what the
[1:32:33] word says
[1:32:35] then you'll make up your mind whether
[1:32:36] you're right or not
[1:32:41] you will decide then whether you're
[1:32:42] right or not
[1:32:45] but what is it
[1:32:47] the new birth is in the soul
[1:32:55] and being that new birth in that soul
[1:32:59] it's dealing not with just justification
[1:33:01] and sanctification that's part of it
[1:33:04] must be there
[1:33:07] just as it is the baby
[1:33:10] must start the process of rejection or
[1:33:14] ejecting from the body and the water
[1:33:16] breaks
[1:33:17] and then the blood and then the baby
[1:33:20] all right the babies of mine dying
[1:33:23] the other things are not as important
[1:33:25] but yet that second I hope you'll think
[1:33:28] about sanctification is the stage in
[1:33:31] your life
[1:33:33] if you want to go to church
[1:33:36] that you'll want to do what's right
[1:33:43] and that you'll think about well you
[1:33:45] know
[1:33:47] I haven't felt God's presence lately
[1:33:58] and the prophet said sometimes it was
[1:34:00] because the Holy Spirit had to go out on
[1:34:01] a limb and get away from you that don't
[1:34:05] mean you lost
[1:34:07] but what if it is that you're just
[1:34:08] Justified and sanctified
[1:34:15] so you've got to make your choice as
[1:34:16] your answer
[1:34:18] and your answer will determine your
[1:34:20] destination let's just read a few quotes
[1:34:22] all right let's start off number one on
[1:34:24] the evening message
[1:34:26] and watch what the prophet says on the
[1:34:28] power of transformation
[1:34:34] 1965 1031 paragraph 311. that little
[1:34:38] inside of the inside
[1:34:41] that's where you start
[1:34:43] which is your soul
[1:34:46] then come from that
[1:34:49] your spirit
[1:34:51] then you become a living being
[1:34:54] now the living being has since five
[1:34:57] senses to contact the second has five
[1:35:00] senses
[1:35:02] that's the outside body see text field
[1:35:03] smelling here the inside body has love
[1:35:06] conscience and so forth five senses but
[1:35:10] inside of the inside the control tower
[1:35:12] it's either God or Satan
[1:35:17] yeah
[1:35:19] and you can mimic any of these things
[1:35:22] you can contact
[1:35:25] and I sound like you know
[1:35:28] what do you mean you can't say what he
[1:35:31] meant but I can say one thing for sure
[1:35:32] he said you can mimic anything that you
[1:35:34] get around and learn of
[1:35:37] anything you contact you can mimic it
[1:35:39] right brother Gary was here he can talk
[1:35:41] like everybody in this building
[1:35:46] because he he mimic it
[1:35:50] so you men make anything that you're
[1:35:52] around
[1:35:53] is that sensible what he's to say all
[1:35:55] right
[1:35:56] like like a Christian
[1:36:00] or you could cast out devils like a
[1:36:02] Christian
[1:36:03] but the inside control tower the
[1:36:06] beginning the origin
[1:36:08] isn't of God
[1:36:10] it'll never return to God
[1:36:13] do you understand
[1:36:15] did not Jesus did not Judas cast out
[1:36:18] Devils did not confused the one who
[1:36:20] condemned him and put him to death even
[1:36:23] prophesy
[1:36:25] but he couldn't stay with the word
[1:36:30] he couldn't do that
[1:36:32] but he had everything else
[1:36:34] look what he says on this inside of the
[1:36:36] inside works his faith expressed
[1:36:39] paragraph 207 and notice it's got to be
[1:36:42] five f e i t h
[1:36:46] outside Spirit Jesus on the inside y o u
[1:36:50] now that's
[1:36:52] how standing here looking at you now
[1:36:54] watch him he's explaining his gift but
[1:36:57] look what he says
[1:36:59] that's how standing here looking at you
[1:37:02] he had the new birth right
[1:37:06] you know come on you agree you had a new
[1:37:08] birth right
[1:37:10] amen but watching
[1:37:12] that's how standing here looking at you
[1:37:14] I don't know a one of you
[1:37:19] well he just didn't know oh okay the
[1:37:22] spirit can anoint me still I don't know
[1:37:25] none of you
[1:37:31] but when the inside of the inside breaks
[1:37:34] in that's God
[1:37:36] I'm going to give you a quote that
[1:37:38] astounded me when I first remember it
[1:37:44] he said you know this discernment
[1:37:47] that I have you remember what it called
[1:37:49] it
[1:37:53] he said it's a revelation
[1:38:01] he said just discernment I have you want
[1:38:03] to quote I think that's fine I wouldn't
[1:38:05] be making if I didn't know
[1:38:08] he said it's a revelation
[1:38:12] well how are you going fool with a
[1:38:14] revelation
[1:38:15] you see why he's so certain about that
[1:38:17] gift that he had and what he was doing
[1:38:20] he didn't fool with it he didn't make it
[1:38:22] work it worked him right
[1:38:26] that's where the outside can reason you
[1:38:28] take a man say well you know I know if
[1:38:30] I'm I'm not supposed to commit adultery
[1:38:32] but you know then the spirit tells me I
[1:38:35] shouldn't commit adultery but you see
[1:38:37] way down in there is still that thing in
[1:38:41] there see it'll kind of govern around
[1:38:45] and better watch it
[1:38:47] but when it's directed from the inside
[1:38:50] it throws all the rest of it together
[1:38:53] that's the god post that's the control
[1:38:56] tower the inside of the inside the soul
[1:39:00] controls the spirit the spirit controls
[1:39:03] the body
[1:39:04] show an outside White Horse don't make
[1:39:08] any difference them religious people
[1:39:10] back there that Paul called Whited walls
[1:39:13] and so forth they were outward
[1:39:16] just every way the a Believer and they
[1:39:18] had prophecies among them and everything
[1:39:21] else but the inside of the inside the
[1:39:24] soul that disbelieved it that's the
[1:39:27] reason I say people can jump up and down
[1:39:29] and speak in tongues people can shout
[1:39:31] their hands on the sick and heal the
[1:39:34] sick and so forth by faith
[1:39:38] gifts right by faith all these great
[1:39:41] things by the spirit
[1:39:44] still be lost
[1:39:46] anointed ones
[1:39:48] all right are you following me look at
[1:39:51] the next one
[1:39:53] we'll get a couple of these and then
[1:39:54] I'll drop off and make the next message
[1:39:56] out of these
[1:39:58] look what he says on leadership
[1:40:01] now look I'm a Pentecostal you say I'm
[1:40:04] this or whatever you are
[1:40:06] I profess to dance in the spirit
[1:40:08] but brother Branham I thought as long as
[1:40:11] we had that
[1:40:12] we had it
[1:40:15] you have it
[1:40:17] is that the way he's saying see the man
[1:40:19] said I thought as long as we had that we
[1:40:22] had it
[1:40:23] he said you don't you haven't
[1:40:25] if you believe me to be God's Prophet
[1:40:27] you listen to my words see that's a
[1:40:30] deception in this day
[1:40:35] didn't the Bible say it'd be so close it
[1:40:37] would deceive the very elect if possible
[1:40:39] the elected down to the soul
[1:40:44] yeah
[1:40:46] but if you dice in the spirit still with
[1:40:48] the things of the world there's
[1:40:50] something wrong if you speak with
[1:40:51] tongues Paul said I can speak with
[1:40:53] tongues of men and angels and still not
[1:40:55] even be saved both kinds see I can do
[1:40:59] all the emotions I can have faith I can
[1:41:02] preach the gospel I can give all my
[1:41:04] goods to feed the poor I can carry the
[1:41:07] word in the mission Fields acrossed and
[1:41:10] still I'm wrong see and it's see it's
[1:41:13] that inside of the inside brother your
[1:41:16] spirit breaking up when you die it takes
[1:41:19] its flight but your soul lives
[1:41:22] what about it
[1:41:24] inside of the inside
[1:41:30] all right drop back on this Wednesday
[1:41:32] but I want to get one little point then
[1:41:35] we'll draw I'm not Wednesday next Sunday
[1:41:40] you said brother Dale do you believe
[1:41:42] that
[1:41:43] of truly born again
[1:41:45] Christian
[1:41:50] can do wrong
[1:41:52] do things wrong
[1:41:57] certainly do
[1:42:03] you're not supposed to go out and keep
[1:42:05] doing it all the time all right we can
[1:42:07] go over that
[1:42:12] but you tell me you don't never have a
[1:42:14] wrong thought
[1:42:23] right
[1:42:26] you tell me you never have a wrong call
[1:42:28] whatsoever
[1:42:30] I just beat you to the point and I'll
[1:42:32] call you a liar
[1:42:35] because if that's what I said that's
[1:42:37] what I'd be
[1:42:38] you're louder
[1:42:42] see Jesus had wrong thoughts
[1:42:46] do you agree
[1:42:50] did not The Devil tempt him in all forms
[1:42:53] turn us into bread do this that do that
[1:42:55] and the other and brother Robin said he
[1:42:56] even tempted a women now that's his
[1:42:59] statement trying to make Jesus in the
[1:43:01] wrong person but to show him how human
[1:43:03] that he was
[1:43:08] now remember his body was created a
[1:43:11] virgin birth his Spirit was the spirit
[1:43:14] and Sunder times in diverse manner
[1:43:17] so then the devil could still tempt him
[1:43:21] in his Spirit Realm
[1:43:24] that's why in his Spirit realm dropping
[1:43:27] back to the word that was within him he
[1:43:29] turns and he says get behind me
[1:43:33] he never denied none of his talks and
[1:43:35] ideas just get behind me
[1:43:41] don't ever think you'll get to the
[1:43:42] places you cannot be tempted
[1:43:49] because you would be wrong
[1:43:51] but a true Christian
[1:43:55] where do you do wrong man
[1:43:59] your body would display what the
[1:44:02] unbelief or thoughts or you know mad or
[1:44:07] words you would say or something would
[1:44:09] come through your body through the vocal
[1:44:10] cords
[1:44:12] but that Spirit within you can cause you
[1:44:14] to do those things
[1:44:16] and you still even be a truly born-again
[1:44:19] Christian
[1:44:22] now I'm as honest as can be I said it to
[1:44:25] start with I have wrong thoughts
[1:44:27] well you know if I didn't believe it
[1:44:29] that way I would be the most horrible
[1:44:30] person in this building and I would sit
[1:44:33] down right now and never preach again
[1:44:40] if I can't leave it to the basis that I
[1:44:43] do have a sensible answer
[1:44:46] that within my soul
[1:44:48] God cannot as John said is seed
[1:44:52] remaineth in him
[1:44:54] and the seed cannot sin he didn't say
[1:44:56] the person the seed came
[1:45:00] you ever get to the bases that you say I
[1:45:02] don't do anything wrong
[1:45:04] just remember the devil's already got
[1:45:06] you right in the middle of his traps
[1:45:08] right where he wants you
[1:45:10] why do we need an advocate
[1:45:16] if we don't do wrong
[1:45:19] come on foe
[1:45:24] Prophet do you sin he said every day
[1:45:30] see that's why we got to have the
[1:45:31] advocate
[1:45:35] after you're born again when you get the
[1:45:37] advocate you don't get the advocate
[1:45:38] before you're born again
[1:45:41] the Holy Ghost is the average
[1:45:43] I can't even pronounce the word advocate
[1:45:47] huh
[1:45:50] that Holy Ghost inside of you he's the
[1:45:52] one that takes care of all the things
[1:45:56] you see one of these days maybe it'll
[1:45:58] Dawn on us a lot of the things is really
[1:45:59] Bible
[1:46:01] where it says the spirit maketh
[1:46:03] intercession
[1:46:06] with Words that cannot be spoken
[1:46:09] was he making intercession for if I
[1:46:11] ain't doing wrong
[1:46:15] come on
[1:46:19] well brother Dale it sounded like you
[1:46:21] mean you just go out and live like the
[1:46:22] devil I try not to
[1:46:28] I try to fight him a little
[1:46:32] I've always tried my best to tell you
[1:46:36] and when you get to be 75 years old
[1:46:38] you'll find it out
[1:46:41] when I retired from General Motors
[1:46:43] I said I'm not going to sit down
[1:46:47] because if I go home and sit down
[1:46:51] my arthritis and all them boogers that
[1:46:54] I've got all these years they're going
[1:46:56] to take me and I ain't gonna be able to
[1:46:58] move
[1:47:00] so I'm going to fight him if he gets
[1:47:03] this body he's got a struggle if you
[1:47:06] don't do that you're giving in to it
[1:47:12] that's why to me I don't have no problem
[1:47:14] go to the doctor he said how you doing I
[1:47:16] said I'm doing wonderful
[1:47:18] I finally got convinced I got to tell
[1:47:20] him they were doctor reading them up
[1:47:22] here I got a bad cold
[1:47:24] or my legs are hurting help me get rid
[1:47:26] of this
[1:47:27] but I'm simply saying by Stripes I'm
[1:47:30] Healed
[1:47:34] verse all of these years I stood with
[1:47:37] that to work the hurting
[1:47:41] but I still say I'm Healed
[1:47:44] you keep confessing your healing you
[1:47:46] know what something you just might one
[1:47:48] of these days get a good Revelation and
[1:47:50] it worked
[1:47:51] you know what but if you don't confess
[1:47:53] it how can it work
[1:47:57] s i
[1:47:58] is that not what it is with salvation
[1:48:01] that you must confess that you're saved
[1:48:03] before you can be saved
[1:48:06] you must confess that you're healed
[1:48:08] before you can be healed you know
[1:48:10] somebody one of these days gonna say I'm
[1:48:11] already changed you know what God's
[1:48:13] going to make that manifest and just
[1:48:15] take somebody into the change
[1:48:17] but you know what we sit around well
[1:48:19] we're all in bad trip you're in bad
[1:48:21] shape I'm bad shape it's all in bad
[1:48:23] shape
[1:48:26] poor little petty thing
[1:48:34] really curious daddy said
[1:48:38] man walks into my office I'm
[1:48:40] paraphrasing
[1:48:42] he said I want him to have a positive
[1:48:44] attitude
[1:48:47] you can deal with somebody's got a
[1:48:49] positive attitude right
[1:48:51] right but if you've got a total negative
[1:48:52] attitude how can anybody help you you
[1:48:56] never heard this statement they're dying
[1:48:59] because they've give up
[1:49:02] you never heard that
[1:49:05] because they give up
[1:49:07] now you know what to call it hospice
[1:49:15] because hospice comes in then what do
[1:49:18] they do
[1:49:20] they can give you
[1:49:23] away under more pain medicine than a
[1:49:26] regular doctor
[1:49:28] they give you all kind of drugs that a
[1:49:30] regular doctor can't give you
[1:49:32] why because you already give up
[1:49:40] his life didn't want to go about it but
[1:49:41] Aaron was telling about somebody
[1:49:44] been 18 months on hospice now have you
[1:49:47] ever heard of that
[1:49:48] they'll figure out a while that old
[1:49:50] Feller ain't give up or whatever it is
[1:49:54] get out of here you ain't give up yet
[1:49:58] then give out one thing but giving up is
[1:50:00] a lot of difference
[1:50:03] what do you think about the new birth
[1:50:09] I hope these things have been come on
[1:50:11] brothers
[1:50:12] been some instructive talks
[1:50:17] to where we can understand
[1:50:27] how is it the person of Jesus Christ
[1:50:30] can come in you
[1:50:33] and live in you
[1:50:40] see your mind automatically goes
[1:50:44] to an anointing
[1:50:48] it's just a spirit
[1:50:56] it's just a baptism and a spirit
[1:51:01] oh we want to put it all in there but
[1:51:03] you know there's a lot of quotes around
[1:51:05] talks about you know how the baptism of
[1:51:07] the spirit
[1:51:09] and still not be right
[1:51:13] he said because that's only
[1:51:19] power
[1:51:21] and placing you in the body
[1:51:26] you see we've got a long ways to go
[1:51:30] I just hope there's enough time
[1:51:34] well you shouldn't make them statements
[1:51:36] for one of these days I got to
[1:51:41] see we think we get it all figured out
[1:51:42] somebody comes along that knows a little
[1:51:45] bit about what they're talking about and
[1:51:46] it's Mass confusion
[1:51:48] well you know what
[1:51:51] I know a little bit about electricity
[1:51:54] I've wired that panel I've done it I can
[1:51:57] wear a whole house I can do all about it
[1:52:00] but I sure ain't going to talk to
[1:52:02] Einstein
[1:52:06] you know what I ain't gonna talk to
[1:52:08] Aaron about it either
[1:52:09] when he can send them the numbers that
[1:52:11] have no numbers that are numbers
[1:52:16] fidgetive numbers or whatever you call
[1:52:18] them
[1:52:20] imaginary numbers
[1:52:23] I ain't going to talk to him
[1:52:28] but I will talk to you about what I do
[1:52:30] you know what I know
[1:52:33] the first time I went to Jamaica my wife
[1:52:35] told him said well honey as much as you
[1:52:37] know about all of those things that you
[1:52:39] can help them do a lot of things I got
[1:52:40] over there and I walked back and I
[1:52:42] looked at their wiring
[1:52:44] you know I looked at the panel and I
[1:52:46] said ain't gonna touch it
[1:52:49] because they'll start off dealing with
[1:52:50] 220.
[1:52:52] they do
[1:52:54] and they say if we get our all of ours
[1:52:57] on the 220 because I half your bill
[1:53:00] because it cost you that much to down it
[1:53:02] to 110.
[1:53:06] I ain't gonna touch it
[1:53:09] but now you explain it to me in simple
[1:53:11] terminologies for a minute and I'll do
[1:53:13] one
[1:53:16] I just hope the gospel is that away
[1:53:17] let's stand somebody to explain just a
[1:53:20] little something to you what we got boys
[1:53:23] come and dine
[1:53:25] anybody have a need
[1:53:28] words
[1:53:50] coming down
[1:54:01] what do you think about salvation
[1:54:07] God's not enough for you to give his own
[1:54:11] life
[1:54:12] may I quote the prophets if there was
[1:54:15] just one person
[1:54:17] in the world
[1:54:24] he said he still climb on the cross and
[1:54:27] died
[1:54:33] and you're that person Jesus
[1:55:01] foreign
[1:55:41] forgiving my voice is gone but they can
[1:55:44] sing it well we got one more boy
[1:55:49] I know it was the blood
[1:55:52] it's 171.
[1:55:54] that is
[1:56:12] one day when I was lost he died on the
[1:56:17] cross
[1:56:23] it was Emmanuel's blood it was
[1:56:27] Emmanuel's but it was a manual blood for
[1:56:33] me one day when I was lost he died upon
[1:56:39] the cross and I know it was the blood
[1:56:43] foreign
[1:56:48] I know
[1:56:50] I know it was lost
[1:57:04] for me
[1:57:07] it was
[1:57:14] like for me
[1:57:18] one day when I was lost
[1:57:26] for me
