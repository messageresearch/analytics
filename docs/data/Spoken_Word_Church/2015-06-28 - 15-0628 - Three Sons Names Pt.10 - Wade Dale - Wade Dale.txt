========================================

so now we're going to have to get your Bible doubt those we're going to redesign get my old Bible out because I got a lot of notes written on my bow I can't see it well I'll put a zq up there yet but I'm going to read out of my Bible then we're going to Ezekiel chapter 1 because we've been speaking on three sons names all right remember God come in three sons name son of god it's on a man son of David and they all have a dispensation they all come in a dispensation that they all have now listen they all have different characteristics but it's the same person all right cuz even jesus said i was reading it this weekend or this week jesus said jesus said that the son of man if you say something against the son of man it will be forgiven right but if you say something against the son of god it will not be forgiven in this world of the world come so sure Kevin camera okay it won't be forgiven in this world of the world to come so so that's your dispensation now what happened brother Brown said the Son of God was in the son of man when Jesus said that he said I'll forgive you here but there's no forgiveness if you speak against this one okay because brother adam said the atonement had not been made yet alright so the atonement not been made yet you could speak against Jesus because look Peter spoke against you Kirsten you know after Jesus told him he was going to do it he still did and cursed him will see that was spoken against the son of man that one that spoke Peter didn't have a revelation true revelation because the person was not inside Peter yet I so God would forgive that God would forgive these other ones that don't do time that spoke against him and you go you say well give me a good example let me give you one good one Paul the Apostle Paul caused Christians to blast man he caused them to in other words forget their religion he caused them to be put to death what was paul doing Paul was doing that in the flesh right he was doing that in the flesh and that's why I see that many people they say well he had this seat of God any let me have a seat of God in him I thought that bride King person keep bright or seen him god I can't persecutor see to God Paul was dead Paul was dead he said he was dead he was dead in trespasses then blast spent causing people to blast man now how could he do that was something inside of the soul that was righteous you couldn't do that but on the road to Emmaus God clicking the word that Paul held right I'll help a letter of the Old Testament he held that letter to the tea's at a Pharisee of the Pharisees he said according to the law blameless in other words you Paul could have been a high priest right but that he said that does me no good now right because what the Son of God the spirit of god was now involved but Paul could cause God in human flesh Christian to do that and not be held against Paul so we can ever I understand that okay that's why Jesus could say you speak against the Sun man it'll be forgiven you you speak against the son of god which is what the Spirit the Holy Ghost you speak against the Holy Ghost it will not be forgiven that's blasphemy okay so now we've been talking on the Son of God for those of you that haven't been here for nine or eight Sunday's the Sun God is the spirit god the low gods that the the speech the word in the beginning was the word Word was with God and the Word was God right all right the same was in the beginning with God there's your Creator that's the one that created all things that's the father all right everybody got that that's the spirit god hi now then you got to go to verse 14 of John that says and the Word was made flesh so he took the Son God the spirit guide or the word and that word was made flesh in beasts on man called Jesus Christ right he was the son of man he was all of God in one person right you and I are not all of God in one person I on my part each of these brothers sisters we all have our part because we're the body we have parts he was the head he was the whole body was everything so he had the fullness of god that's why he could we could say that the Son of God was the creator and that creator went into human flesh called Jesus Christ and they still acknowledge him as the creator right to go over to the James and over into the books after Jesus and loud and come back they have they got a revelation that out the Creator was inside that man alright so they knew that it was the same person but manifested in a different form so brother Adam told us that there was three manifestation chicon it's on a man son david right now son david has nothing to do with us as far as this journey that we're on but it does have something to do with us because what we have go there right because to Israel he'll be the son of David promised in the Bible we read it later we're going to have felt but but the son of David is to the Jews right we're going to read here in Ezekiel how gone and it's a good little revelation that we look here in the zekiel and let's look at the background of Ezekiel because the Ezekiel speaks first time it's really spoken up a son of man son and prophesize not a man prophesied 70-something times just in the Book of Ezekiel it says some amount of prophesied but watch I want you to see the correlation though between Ezekiel Daniel and God okay is the hue manual and John there's a there's a correlation there number one is Daniel outside of his city when he wrote the book of daniel remember he was in captivity right Ezekiel was in captivity he was in Babylon he was away from his country all right where was John John was not in Jerusalem John was only out patents so he was away from his country same way with you and I you and I were away from our country and that's where God is revealing but what's here illegally that you got to come back into the country right right he's telling the Israel you need right there that you use them you know where I got it from Schofield Schofield footnote says he prophesied out of the land and his prophecy like there's followed the method of symbols and visions he said like Daniel and John so I didn't get a revelation that I but idea read you know brother grant got a lot of things up don't wield writing so I like to read the footnotes in them and the headers and all that you know this is the beginning of you think you're out here and that's that's where you read the commentary and it really is to me it's a it's a great thing because Daniel uses symbols Ezekiel use assembled and da youth assembly so God's bringing them a symbol but I was it to us it's a revelation to us it's the end between like we were talking about it's the Word of God that's not written down but it is written in the hearts of men right because as we spoke many times before if if back when God said let there be light if everything to be written in a book there's no way we could read it it'd be so huge so we couldn't be able to read it but he condensed it down who God condensed into 66 books and now it's easy for us to read so this is the word of God now is this all the word of God yeah that we need for now but in between there is a lot of the things written that we don't that we don't see with our eyes that's why I love them when the Bible says see I don't I don't I don't even think of eyes it's understanding see because jesus said the world will see me no more well they won't physically steam that seem to us but see means to understand in other words the world will never understand Jesus Christ except through menu alright so same thing with the the correlation between what Daniel was what given a history of how they were going to come out of avalon back into the end of their homeland right brother and said god never deals with this rope till they get back in their homeland so he's he killed was out of his homeland God come down and sit Ezekiel prophesied what prophesied that you're going to go back into the land same thing with John of course John was a heavenly be showing us because the Book of Revelations is not totally digital it's nice alright the bride my brother else is to the bride so what is it symbols and types to get us back to our homeland okay right so so what I'm saying he couldn't have just been Spirit God he had to drop down and be flesh died hey man because of the fall because where did we fall we fell in flesh Adam didn't fall and soul because remember the Bible says in the Book of Luke as you go down through the chronology it says Adam was what some guy hi so in the Old Testament Adam was the son of God the only Son of God that have eternal life in his soul as an indwelling right that maybe was on God because it was the spirit what that Genesis 126 man entered the 27 man but the revelation of the Son of man has not been until the end time to really realize because listen obviously Adam was a man right and he had a son of God in that son of man remember he was prefigured Jesus Christ right he was the first Adam Wright showing prefigured Christ so he was the son of man called son of man is the son of God in a man watch what it is see even you gotta be real you got to be real you got to watch tall with the Sun man because he had gone in his flesh but the revelation of the Son of Man the one that was standing there on earth d Son of Man was not included okay because it even to Ezekiel he sits on a man prophesied saw the man prophesied what's he doing he's telling you that God has come down into flesh and it's speaking because that's all I week we can't understand what bible say God is a spirit and then the worship you must worship in spirit driven in Jesus turnaround said you've seen that spirit you've seen me know what right you've seen me you've seen the father so he's telling them that that did church worshipping he's standing in front of your now that's what the Pharisees couldn't get they were the god of Moses was up in a pillow or a fire and and back into ghetto the Holy of Holies Jesus was trying to say that's all done back then but I'm standing here and then I'll be son of man I am now God in human flesh standing here talking to you and they turned that down right right they turn that down they turned the goddamn right he said they said you a man making yourself God we're really it was God had made a supplement right hey man but remember this son of man to be the son of man listen to be the son of man is not born of woman I mean as we are safe they're 18 right they're going one man well a backseat to Adam and Jesus Christ but Adam was created a full-grown man so he could not exactly type everything as far as me and you because we were going through a mother Jesus had to come down and be the Word made flesh born through a human woman to take away a curse that happened in the garden everybody got that if I got them so that's what's going to happen so now in the end time to me this in this takes away the sin curve this and this takes what remember as we spoke many times before this has no sin never sent a day in his life never had a bad thought this is the Creator this is God himself this is the one that created the world the purest form that ever was and eternal now the son of man had to be made eternal the son of man died this man cannot now this man was tempted this man can't be 10 right this man can be tempted this man can't that's why that's why I brother branham will read it next Sunday he said that's the reason that Jesus said you can say something against the son of man because he was a little lower form you could say something against that son of man that'd be forgiven you but when you say something against the Creator the one that created off when you say something against that that's why that we can forgive each other if I have a bump against bobbin and you know look at Paul and Barnabas Paul and Barnabas was to holy ghost filled call being a prophet and Barnabas was right behind me they worked together for a long time but they was one time in the Bible they had a contingent than the Bible said it was so bitter that they separated so see when we're in flesh we have all these things Jesus could be tempted yes Jesus were tempted in all points yeah right yeah this man's never been tempted man this man is never sitting and the son of man had some ass did not sin right right but he was born in this sinful world he had to be changed they don't leave this don't need a change mm-hmm that's mine once we realize if you're born again your change is already started you're changing already back that was the prophecy now listen that was the problem that's my people are weighing in the grave they got a revelation that God died for their sins they accepted it and they lived a good Christian life they did not deal much with the flesh because this flesh is rotting discipline you know we're going to get a new body well you know what God winked at that ignorance but if that son of God was in those people they're going to resurrect just as if just like somebody that died in this church the ones back in Paul Irene is Martin Luther Columba brother Brown said all they done was just said they were Christian and they will kill the IMP reached 25 your sermon they just accepted Christianity accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior they were killed God give them the Holy Ghost they were killed and they're waiting on you and I why because they were not able to come to a flesh change cuz look this don't need a change one more time yes don't need a change this needs a change because the son of man went through a change death burial resurrection when he resurrected he said all power in heaven there has been given unto me now he didn't say that before why didn't he said it before because it was son of god in son of man dispensation but now when Jesus rose that dispensation put the two together sure they were together the whole time but the understanding got it the understanding of the son of man but we read it next Sunday and most preachers most people to message if you told that they look at you cross-eyed it looks like I've got a horn sticking out of your head or something when Jesus asked Peter who do man say I the Son of Man am Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God right needed answered Jesus this question that's because he didn't understand it cuz remember jesus said flesh and blood did not reveal that to you but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock revelation I'll build my church now you didn't build church on son of man with a beluga body change in the first entertain he built in a revelation of the Son of God brother Graham said he died son ma'am he wrote son of God will bring all those folks next sunday i just want you to get thinking about and we're going to read this in the zekiel in a minute but he died son of man coach Sonny God think I son of man got a man he's undergone Canada this left Jesus at the cross and this died cuz flesh the flesh not gon take that you can't die but the son of man died but when he resurrected brother Brown says hear o son of god what he put back together again and he's been the son of god through seven church ages what the Spirit of God people accepting Jesus as their Savior him the atonement being made they accept that coma and they become Christians and they live the good Christian life in the doc because it didn't come to this revelation that's why the prophet of God had to do two things brother Brown said this messenger Malachi forced to do two things one turn the hearts of the children back to the father's one get this straightened back out they have lost all this then what to reveal the seven thunders the sealed to what to literally to change your body amen so that's the two parts of Malachi 4 did was number one years of preparation 1947 to 1963 that was to get that revelation back to its perfection because the first church age had a perfect revelation of the Son of God they had water baptism right they got all the things right the first hurricane okay right then it was lost down through the other church ages father son Holy Ghost baptism come in three God's Trinity and all that thing what was william branham to do that spirit of Elijah was to what restore the first part 47 263 restore back the faith of the Father and then bring the revelation that had not been seen before he said everyone who that man really was but not who that man really was who that man really is a man because brother Ram even said he's they say you say some people say you're at least on a man he said no I lace on a man now he should have said I'm a son of God if he had that revelation he had not a different but a more of a revelation when he said I'm a son of man revealing the son of man what was he telling us there was standing guard in human flesh revealing the Jesus that was walking in human flesh right compete really I mean he talks about ntp he goes back and forth you'll say we're sons of God you know say we're sons of men but when the anyone somebody told a scheme that question he said I am NOT least on amenities that I am a son man in Sam Sun God he knew it was son of god he knew that revelation had come up a little higher that that man that was walking in human flesh Jesus was standing he said not two feet from me while he went back to what spirit so whose flesh is it now it's not flesh that he's working through all right let's read his eagle let's see if I'm gonna read some of my notes I got on here oh my turn you can read that shirt but now remember as Ezekiel is out of them out of the country out of his homeland and God is telling you the fuel to tell Israel you have sinned right same way with Daniel come to the Ancient of Days air white as well that's the same as revelation 1 and what we've been reading upstairs for months see revelations wouldn't i watch this now came to pass in the thirteenth year and the fourth month fifth day I was among the captives of the river Chebar that the heavens were open and where have you heard that before revelations for one says they what door was opened in heaven brother Matthew last Sunday I don't think you really got into a star and he got a little sidetracked but but every time you see heaven open and the windows of heaven open why did the heavens open in the cloud come down to brother ground there was a revelation coming through that open gap or that open door remember he said anywhere you see the heavens were open but what is it the heavens r / there's a revelation come down well look right here the heavens were opened revelations for once it is the door was opened in heaven all right and I saw visions of God in the fifth day of the month which is the fifth year King yokai's cat from joel 19 captivity the word of the Lord came expressly undoes each of the priests amount of booze I'd the land of the Chaldeans by the realty bar the hand of the Lord was there upon him all right and I look and behold a whirlwind came out of the north a great cloud and firing folding itself and brightness was about it have the minster over the color of amber i will miss to the fire when did that Miss revelations one in the midst of the seven golden chem stick one lock into the son of man to watch what's this though is it goes further and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the north great cloud of firing phone except brightens was about how the master of the color ever out of mr. fire also out of the mr. l came to lightness and a look there's a likeness of four living creatures but watch and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man you remember the line aux man and eagle right well that's what he sees but when he when he sums it up he says and this was their appearance they had the likeness of the land right and everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings and their fevers and their feet were straight feet the soul that feels like the soul of taps foot they sparkled like the color burnished brass and they had the hands of a man under the wings under four sides and that before they four had their faces and remember all of this is summed up in one man just like when John turns when Daniel turns and sees the Ancient of Days he sees the judgment we join turns and he sees one lock into the Sun man in the midst of the seven golden constant now remember what is the 4 b's the line aux man and eco brother Ram said that's the holy go right that's all ego goes remember when he got to the seal back to the fourth seal he said you don't see the combat be skinny morning's it so the rapture must take place on the fourth seal so there's no more combat beef because they're there for me and you this is the bride that's the same thing you saw because if he turned and saw one lock into the Son of Man of Revelations one as if you'll turns and this is his revelation of it right alright cuz there's no bride at this time alright alright everybody got that that's for the likeness of their faces they four had the face of a man face of a line then the face of an ox and an eagle so there's your line ox mana needle right before the swill their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings of each one joint we can cover all this but I want to get to something they went everyone straight forward Ryan had this ? one remember that you said how in the world can for objects be looking in four different directions but keep going straight the whole time well see it it's like this the latter ox man an eagle is the holy ghost right so these are symbols so the lion is bold right the Ox is sacrificial the man is intelligent and the eagle is perfect right now sometimes you need the Holy Ghost to be prophetic in your life right so it's going forward if you need to bonus of a line it goes forward if you need a lightness of the eagle I mean the man you need some intelligent sure of Guardian tells us we all did it goes forward so you see it's not it's not like a let's try to explain it's not like that you take line an ox man needle and there's no way they can go he says all four we're facing forward going straight well if you go straight this way this is going backwards but if you need this this is what's going forward if you need this this is what's going forward if you need this this is what's going forward you see what I'm saying so the Bible's crept i believe is easier was seeing that rotate the line the off the man in the eagle cuz it says the lines to the living creature their parents was like burning well I'm sorry verse 12 this is what the question was I'm you can't remember that you get home okay you've had three children since then and then brain dead and they went everyone straight forward whether the spirit was to go so it was what the spirit was leading would bring them to the forefront they went they turn not when they went that was Ryan's question he said how in the world can be he said well you just said they turn when all they just step forward in your revelation if you need the lion the bonus that's part of the home of those steps forward in your life and you use it because listen you're not going to be all time you know the big old all the time sometimes you're going to need the ops you're going to need something you'll need to be you're going to need for your children inside of the world been out of the world ten years and you going to have to have that Hawks grinding grinding pulling and pulling right we can put all those in here which we never did but we you know the lines Mountain Eagle you put in Statue form em and they turn not when they win as for the lightness of living creatures their characters like burning coals of fire likely parents of lamb what up and down along the living creature in other words all the way through and the fire was bright now the fire lit forked lightning and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning up that no up I'm trying to read some of the notes on a month vote I can't see them now as I'll be held to living creatures but we'll keep looking at behold one will upon the earth by the living creatures with his more faces now look this is that wheel in the middle the wheel in Ezekiel saw which brother branham explained as Jesus he saw Christ with the children of Israel in motion through the wilderness alright well same thing through your life through your journey because it was in Israel what was Israel journey get back to the homeland baby and the forehead one lightness and their parents and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of wheel when they went they went upon their four sides and they turned on when they went we've already explained that as for their rings they were so high that they were dreadful in the ring for full lives round about them for eyes is what understanding revelation all right and when the living creatures went the wheel went by them is when the living creatures will lift it up from the earth the wheels were lifted up there's your Raptor there's her actor right there alright because when they lift it up the wheel went up when Christ goes up before living creatures go up and then I see for seal that's my brother found me under the rapture took place on the more seal because all the creatures were gone you can see him in the fifth seal all right whether the spirit was to go they went there was this spirit to go the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of a living creature was in the wheel when those went these went and he stood he stood when these were lifted up from the earth of wheels were lifted up over against him for the spirit of the living creature within the wheel and the likeness of the firmament upon a head to the living creature was at the color of terrible crystal stretch forth over their heads above and under the firmament will their way straight one or the other every which have to which covered on this side everyone had to what's covered on that side anyone do that and when they when I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great water what is that explaining water and the Bible is people so there's your bride and multitude form he heard the voice of water the water to hear he heard a roaring he wore a year what people voices as the voice of the almighty the voice of speech as the noise of a host when they stood they let down their wings and there was a voice from the permanent that was over their heads when they stood and let the wings down then we got to get through this before with clothes and I saw as the color of amber know and above the firmament with over their hands with the likeness of a throne remembered revelations for one there was one sitting on the throne alright as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the whiteness of the throne with the likeness as the appearance of a man above it upon it so there's one step on throne same as Revelation chapter one and I I mean Revelation chapter four and I saw as the color of amber program sitting at amber glow that was the pillar fire amber Wright as the apparent sapphire around about within it from the appearance of his loins even though working from the parents of his lawns even delrin now that's the totality of the bride right who that I saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness round about it because remember what what are we in judgment as he parents of the bow that is in the cloud of the day of range so was the appearance of the brightness round about it this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord and what is the glory of the Lord his people and when I saw it I fell upon my face and I heard a voice of one that's paid now we're going whoops our next week but read Ezekiel chapter 2 and 3 because it says in chapter 3 says moreover he said unto me son of man eat what now find this he finds a book and he eats the book is that come familiar from revelations 10 verse 8 alright just read chapter 2 and 3 next week let's couple more bless you
