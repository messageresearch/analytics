[0:00] attention three stages to that Journey
[0:03] three stages to this journey right
[0:07] here let's bow our heads as we prepare
[0:10] to go into the study Lord God we're so
[0:12] grateful for your goodness to us so
[0:14] grateful for the word that you've given
[0:15] us to take us into that promised land
[0:18] that the prophet was speaking of we ask
[0:20] Lord that you just bless our study today
[0:22] bless the service Lord help us Lord
[0:24] Jesus as we dive into these things that
[0:26] you'll guide us and through this through
[0:28] these scriptures and Quicken it to Lord
[0:30] to give us understanding we pray in your
[0:32] name
[0:34] amen now we're going to we're getting
[0:36] into 1 Corinthians chapter 5 which is uh
[0:40] some some real meat and potatoes and uh
[0:43] so just to kind of do a little
[0:45] transition we'll close out the the
[0:47] chapter 4 and and where Paul's saying
[0:51] I'll read these words for though we have
[0:53] you have 10,000 instructors in Christ
[0:56] yet have ye not many fathers for in
[0:58] Christ Jesus I have begotten gotten you
[1:00] through the gospel wherefore I beseech
[1:01] you be followers of me so Paul's
[1:05] exhorting everyone to to look at the
[1:07] example that he's laid out of he's laid
[1:09] out in his life of of of humility and
[1:13] obedience to Christ but it's pointing
[1:15] the way to Christ and so that's what
[1:18] Paul is is is really laying out here
[1:20] that our our our ultimate example is
[1:23] Christ and any Minister any any any uh
[1:26] Church age messenger that's preaching
[1:29] the word they're not pointing the way to
[1:30] themselves although they themselves can
[1:32] be an example in the word they
[1:34] preaching it's all the ultimate goal is
[1:37] to point to Christ as our example so in
[1:41] in uh in chapter 4:1 17 he says for this
[1:44] cause have I sent unto you Timothy who
[1:46] is my beloved Son and faithful in the
[1:48] Lord who shall bring you into
[1:49] remembrance of my ways which be in
[1:51] Christ as I teach everywhere in every
[1:53] church and now I I I I love the way that
[1:56] Paul uses this phrase puffed up
[2:00] and now we're getting into some some
[2:02] character traits how how we how we
[2:04] are now and and now look when you get
[2:07] into chapter five look at we'll examine
[2:09] why why they're puffed up it's it's so
[2:12] interesting to look at the character of
[2:14] of people and how we do and how we how
[2:16] we react to situations he's he's fixing
[2:19] to he's fixing to get on them and he's
[2:21] saying now now some are puffed up as
[2:23] though I would not come to you puffed up
[2:25] all built up in their s like Paul ain't
[2:27] going to come to us and could you you
[2:29] think how you know we we in our Humanity
[2:31] sometimes we we get all upset with
[2:33] somebody for for for no particular
[2:35] reason because we we we think you know
[2:38] we think we're they're getting upset at
[2:40] Paul the church age
[2:43] messenger because because of all these
[2:45] reasons that they got built up within
[2:47] themselves but he said but I've come to
[2:49] you shortly if the Lord will and will
[2:51] know not the speech of them which are
[2:52] puffed up but the power in other words
[2:56] you might be able to say a lot of things
[2:57] but let me see if you're actually
[2:59] manifesting the word of God when I come
[3:01] when I come to you I want to see if
[3:02] you're actually living the word or or if
[3:04] it's just a lot of vain speech for the
[3:07] kingdom of God is not in
[3:09] word now that's well well I thought we
[3:11] were supposed to be about the word but
[3:13] but it's it's got to be lived it's not
[3:15] just something where you you're you're
[3:17] you're telling you know all these saying
[3:19] all these things and and and and
[3:21] harassing one another and so forth and
[3:22] being puffed up but in power what will
[3:25] you shall come unto you with a rod or in
[3:27] love and in the spirit of meekness so
[3:29] he's given them the choice you can
[3:32] decide in what Manner I'm going to come
[3:34] into you with a rod where I'm going to
[3:35] kind of tear the hide off of you or or
[3:38] in love and corrective and peace and
[3:40] meekness to to to bring peace and and
[3:43] restoration and those kind of things now
[3:45] look at what he's he's framing up as we
[3:47] go into chapter 5 that these people are
[3:51] they've got they've got somebody that's
[3:53] living in
[3:54] fornication and rather than humbling
[3:57] themselves and and
[4:00] that that they're act they're actually
[4:03] endorsing that deviant lifestyle and and
[4:08] Paul's framing it up like you you're
[4:10] living you got somebody living in a way
[4:13] that a lot of the world don't even live
[4:15] but instead of uh uh instead of
[4:17] responding in humility and meekness your
[4:21] response is actually to be puffed
[4:24] up now you tell me that ain't the human
[4:26] condition that a lot of times when our
[4:29] when our our own lives and things are
[4:31] not going right and and whatnot we we
[4:33] respond in the wrong way respond get all
[4:36] puffed up like this like a like a
[4:41] little we get all we we get all bent out
[4:44] of shape over things and and and where
[4:47] our own house is is burning down but we
[4:49] get all burnt puffed up so in verse in
[4:52] chapter 5 Paul talks this is how he's
[4:55] framing it up to him it's reported
[4:57] commonly that there is for fornication
[5:00] among you and such
[5:03] fornication as is not so much as named
[5:05] among the Gentiles now y'all remember
[5:08] that we framed up Corinth was was a a
[5:11] little Heathen town where they actually
[5:13] as part of their worship they would go
[5:14] to that Temple of of
[5:17] uh I forget the god the Goddess that
[5:20] they worship but um they they they would
[5:22] actually worship and by by committing
[5:25] fornication and things and and so he's
[5:27] saying this what you're doing here is
[5:30] something that even the world the
[5:31] heathens don't even do but you are
[5:33] defending this person right and what
[5:36] what's he framing up here that that when
[5:39] when you see sin in your life or in your
[5:42] church or whatever don't endorse it
[5:45] because that's our tendency is to baby
[5:47] baby sin and and pet the devil and well
[5:50] we just got to love them and everything
[5:52] but love is going to be corrective love
[5:55] is not going to endure something that's
[5:57] wrong it it's it's going to take a stand
[5:59] for
[6:01] something you you you see you know you
[6:03] see young people smoking pot or
[6:06] something and you you well we got to
[6:08] pour on the love well don't forget to be
[6:10] corrective you got to take a stand and
[6:13] and that's what Paul's saying is is uh
[6:15] he said you're ye are puffed up and have
[6:19] not rather mourned that he that hath
[6:22] done this deed might be taken away from
[6:24] among you so look as we read the rest of
[6:27] this chapter he's he's he's telling them
[6:29] look you're you're still fellowshipping
[6:31] with this person and you're you're
[6:32] treating them as though there's nothing
[6:34] wrong it it's just all good and this
[6:37] person is is is uh doing things that are
[6:41] terrible and so now this this is the
[6:44] human condition that we're talking about
[6:46] that your house would be burning down
[6:50] and you will react to the minister
[6:52] preaching the word as as though the it's
[6:55] The Minister's fault you react to
[6:57] someone that's laying the word out or or
[6:59] or telling you some good advice would
[7:02] get all puffed up well you can't tell me
[7:04] and in the meanwhile it's your own house
[7:06] per the Corinthians Church's house was
[7:09] burning down and they're getting all
[7:11] upset at
[7:12] Paul I got a little bird in a tree
[7:14] that's burn burning
[7:16] down and and that's that's the reaction
[7:19] the Corinthians now being puffed up
[7:20] means it's it's referring to your a
[7:22] state of arrogance and self-exaltation I
[7:25] know more than Paul I I Paul ain't even
[7:28] going to come see see us it's a
[7:31] condition in which a person becomes so
[7:33] overly confident in their own views
[7:35] abilities or achievements to the point
[7:38] of ignoring or rejecting correction from
[7:41] God or others a and so it's the opposite
[7:44] of being humble and
[7:46] receptive and that kind of self
[7:48] exaltation that kind of a a stance or
[7:51] character trait is is going to be just a
[7:54] huge hindrance because it prevents you
[7:56] from really receiving and internalizing
[7:58] God's word
[7:59] instead instead of letting the word of
[8:01] God take a hold of your life and and
[8:03] change you your your reaction is well
[8:06] bless God I know and that that person
[8:10] ain't going to tell me and so when when
[8:12] when you get puffed up they're more
[8:14] concerned about their own opinions and
[8:16] how much they know and their their own
[8:18] background and so and their self-image
[8:20] self-image that's that's the thing that
[8:22] gets us well I I don't want nothing to
[8:25] to hinder what other people think about
[8:27] my self-image I I ain't going raise my
[8:30] hand or I'm not going to say Amen
[8:31] because I don't know want anybody to to
[8:33] to to look at my position or whatever
[8:37] but that's why the the scripture says
[8:38] that God opposes the proud but gives
[8:41] grace to the
[8:42] humble being puffed up not only stops
[8:45] the Holy Spirit from working effectively
[8:47] within the individual but it also
[8:48] disrupts the unity and edification of
[8:50] the church as a whole CU you could you
[8:52] imagine if if like everybody in the
[8:54] church was puffed
[8:56] up that that would that would be uh that
[8:58] would be a nightmare
[9:01] that's what that little Corinthian
[9:02] Church was that that everything's
[9:04] burning down around them and and look
[9:06] what the state what they're in they're
[9:07] defending they're
[9:09] defending what what what a nightmare
[9:12] defending somebody living in sin living
[9:15] in fornication he and now think now this
[9:18] is we'll Frame It Up kind of funny this
[9:21] is like one of those talk shows where
[9:23] you you you got some kind of a horrible
[9:25] scenario coming out a man and his wife
[9:28] and then that the man's son is actually
[9:32] sleeping with the the his dad's step is
[9:36] his stepmother sleeping with his
[9:39] mother's wife and and to for that for a
[9:42] church to look at a scenario like that
[9:44] and say well I'm just going to cover
[9:46] that up it's it's all right but they're
[9:49] they're still going out to the to the
[9:52] uh to McDonald's and you know
[9:55] fellowshipping and and and and having a
[9:57] good old time and sweeping under the
[10:00] rug and they're getting all puffed up
[10:02] about that now you know one person that
[10:06] got real puffed up that Daniel Daniel
[10:07] was explaining in in chapter five of of
[10:10] Daniel to Bel shazar he's talking about
[10:12] his daddy he's like now Bel shashar got
[10:14] all humbled and so Daniel's explaining
[10:16] to him now don't you remember your dad
[10:19] Nebuchadnezzar that that he got all
[10:21] built up in Pride and said well nobody's
[10:23] going to tell me this and that and and
[10:25] God humbled him and and put him out in
[10:27] the in the field and made him eat grass
[10:29] so Daniel's telling him oh Thou King the
[10:31] most high God Gave You Nebuchadnezzar
[10:33] thy father a kingdom and majesty and
[10:35] glory and honor but when his heart was
[10:37] lifted up and his mind hardened in Pride
[10:40] he was deposed from his kingly throne
[10:42] and they took his glory from him now now
[10:46] this kind of goes along with what Paul's
[10:47] trying to express in chapter 5 that when
[10:50] someone gets lifted up in Pride and and
[10:53] and is and is defending the wrong thing
[10:55] or living in sin then what you do you
[10:57] the church can do is turn them over to
[11:00] the devil now we're going to dive into
[11:01] that a little bit turn back in other
[11:03] words back up stop endorsing it back up
[11:06] pull away from it stop endorsing it stop
[11:09] putting your hands around it and saying
[11:10] well well bless God we just got to we
[11:13] got to love this person cuz love
[11:15] sometimes will be just back up and let
[11:17] let the normal let let the devil get a
[11:20] hold and let things progress in a way to
[11:23] where they realize that the devil ain't
[11:27] got nothing good for them let let think
[11:30] like like this is what happened with
[11:31] Nebuchadnezzar he got he got out in the
[11:33] field eating grass living like a wild
[11:37] animal and he began to
[11:40] realize the only thing that could save
[11:42] him was
[11:45] God brother ramman said in the images of
[11:47] Christ he said and this is talking about
[11:49] being puffed up what if there is a cage
[11:52] full of canaries and the cage is the
[11:54] size of this
[11:56] Tabernacle and one little Canary flies
[11:59] up in the cage and says gentlemen I want
[12:01] to tell you all something now now this
[12:03] is speaking of character how how we do
[12:06] now this is I we do like he's saiding
[12:08] what what if there was a cage as big as
[12:09] this whole building this whole
[12:11] Tabernacle and one little Canary is
[12:13] going to get up and say well I bless God
[12:15] I know everything one little Canary
[12:17] flies up in the cage and says gentlemen
[12:19] I want to tell you all something I
[12:20] happen to be just a little Superior to
[12:22] you all you see I'm a canary that knows
[12:25] all about the human being oh I can
[12:28] explain it all I've seen the lady walk
[12:30] through the house I've seen The Children
[12:31] Play I know all about it now you all
[12:33] listen to me and about the time he's
[12:36] pouting off his little brain a Princeton
[12:38] University College man steps up with a
[12:40] polishness of grammar and he begins to
[12:42] carry a conversation with that little
[12:44] Canary brain using the highest grammar
[12:46] that he can and speaking to this little
[12:49] canary bird I'd imagine the little
[12:50] fellow turned his head sideways he would
[12:53] listen from one side to another but he
[12:55] don't know a thing he's talking about
[12:58] yet he can hear him yet he can see him
[13:00] but what does his knowledge amount to
[13:02] nothing because he don't know what the
[13:04] man's talking about why he's got a
[13:07] canary brain he hasn't got a human brain
[13:10] he just understands as canaries
[13:12] understand and that's the way the human
[13:14] is I don't care how intellectual you are
[13:17] we still got Canary brains because we're
[13:20] only human beings now now how we how can
[13:23] we apply this to what Paul's talking
[13:25] about to the Corinthians is that they're
[13:27] looking at it from their little Canary
[13:28] brains standpoint well I don't see there
[13:31] if there's anything wrong with whatever
[13:33] with with this situation but to to
[13:36] really understand things we need God we
[13:38] need a supernatural Revelation so that
[13:41] we can have God will Elevate us from our
[13:43] little Canary brain to where we're
[13:45] looking at things from God's vantage
[13:46] point so we need God and that that
[13:49] puffed up mentality is what gets us in
[13:51] trouble you know brother the Bible even
[13:54] talks about how that you know a a man
[13:57] that uh you know fully loaded down is
[14:01] not going to be rattling uh it it's
[14:03] going to be quiet more quiet and
[14:04] everything but you you have a man that's
[14:06] that's not full up of God and it's going
[14:08] to be making a lot of a lot of noise a
[14:10] lot of commotion as it goes down the
[14:12] road just like a wagon it a a wagon that
[14:15] doesn't have a load is just going to be
[14:16] making a lot of making a lot of noise
[14:18] and and that's the same way that we are
[14:21] sometimes you find the ones that that
[14:23] that are not fully loaded down want to
[14:25] tell everybody and want to be puffed up
[14:26] and want to explain things look what
[14:29] brother Brandon said in a door and the
[14:30] door he said we people out here believe
[14:31] in big things we Americans we want big
[14:35] hats and big Automobiles and big
[14:36] denominations more in the Creed and more
[14:38] in the denomination all we want is big
[14:41] things and God is after
[14:43] small still voices a lot of Racket and
[14:47] noise is what we want a farmer took a
[14:50] wagon one time went down on the field
[14:52] and when he did it bumped and rattled
[14:53] and made a lot of noise when it come
[14:55] back it crossed the same bumps and never
[14:58] even moved
[14:59] it was loaded with good
[15:02] things so we don't want to be puffed
[15:05] up brother R said and why is that so
[15:07] many Christians find so hard to live the
[15:09] Christian Life he said examine ourselves
[15:11] today examine it by the word see is our
[15:14] life ticking off just like that see
[15:16] everything love what's the fruit of it
[15:19] how do you know it's keeping right time
[15:21] it's got love love vth not itself it's
[15:23] not like this this bird of paradise is
[15:26] making a big show it's it's not puffed
[15:29] up it's sociable neighborly loving
[15:33] believing all things hopeing all things
[15:35] love joy peace longsuffering goodness
[15:39] gentleness patience Meek Faith All These
[15:43] Fine qualities is ticking out of that
[15:45] person's life when the holy spirit's in
[15:48] there ticking it around that see that's
[15:50] the that's the worst kind of character
[15:52] trait when you get so built up with
[15:53] within yourself that you can't listen to
[15:55] the word you think that well I I'm the
[15:58] one that has all the the answers I look
[16:00] at all this information that I've got on
[16:02] the internet look at all the studying
[16:03] that I've done and fail to actually
[16:05] humble oursel to listen to what the word
[16:08] says about our life and the way that
[16:10] we're
[16:10] living now so now here's here's getting
[16:14] into the meat and potatoes he said it
[16:16] it's reported that that there is
[16:19] fornication among you now if you want to
[16:21] really dive into this definition just
[16:23] just briefly adultery is the difference
[16:27] between adultery and fornication it's
[16:28] it's it it depends it's looking at the
[16:30] marital Bond at that at that at that
[16:33] vow so adultery is the deliberate
[16:36] betrayal of a marital Bond it's enemy
[16:40] with somebody who is not your spouse but
[16:43] now fornication is any activity outside
[16:46] of the context of your of your marriage
[16:49] so whether it's premarital or
[16:52] extramarital if it's outside of that
[16:54] marital Bond it's expressing an unclean
[16:57] disordered Life In the Flesh I I was
[16:59] looking back through some sermons that
[17:00] brother Dale preached and and he he
[17:02] would really get into how a fornication
[17:05] just Dives right it goes even into uh
[17:08] like the heart condition where you're
[17:10] you're uh you
[17:12] know and I'm I'm going to stay away from
[17:14] that I'm not good but look what Paul's
[17:17] saying he saiding is it's reported
[17:19] commonly there's fornication among you
[17:21] and you are puffed up and have not
[17:22] rather mourned that he that ha done this
[17:25] thing might might be taken away from you
[17:28] for I verely as absent in body but
[17:31] present in spirit have judged already
[17:34] look he's saying I'm not in Corinth I'm
[17:37] I'm hundreds of miles away but I'm still
[17:40] able to judge and tell you that what
[17:42] you're doing is wrong but you there
[17:44] sitting right next to that person are
[17:46] willing to endorse endorse it endorse
[17:49] what hundreds of miles away I'm not
[17:51] willing to endorse I'm judging it as
[17:53] wrong as though I were present
[17:56] concerning them him that ha so done this
[17:58] deed in the name name of our Lord Jesus
[17:59] Christ when you are gathered together in
[18:02] my spirit with the power of our Lord
[18:04] Jesus Christ to deliver such in one unto
[18:07] Satan for the destruction of the flesh
[18:10] that the spirit may be saved in the day
[18:12] of the Lord Jesus your glorying is not
[18:15] good know you not that A little leaven
[18:16] lenth the whole lump Purge out therefore
[18:20] the old leaven that you may be a new
[18:23] lump as ye are unleavened for even
[18:25] Christ Our Passover is s sacrificed for
[18:28] us
[18:29] and turn him over to the devil now
[18:32] here's here's the church's the question
[18:34] for the church are we going to endorse
[18:36] it or are we going to throw our arms
[18:38] around it and say well well I I'm just
[18:40] I'm going to back you up or are we going
[18:43] to condemn
[18:45] it brother R in questions and answers on
[18:48] the Holy Ghost he said that's what's the
[18:49] matter with the churches
[18:50] today when a man comes into the body of
[18:53] Christ and becomes one of the members
[18:55] and starts doing evil instead of you all
[18:58] getting together and doing this very
[18:59] same thing and you brandom Tabernacle do
[19:03] that because as long as you're holding
[19:05] him up he's under the blood as long as
[19:09] you're holding it up endorsing it just
[19:11] going along with it well you know I know
[19:15] I know he's living that way but we we're
[19:18] just we're just going to come to church
[19:19] and just just go through the motions
[19:21] anyway and just act like it ain't
[19:24] there and he just keeps doing the same
[19:27] old thing over and over and over all the
[19:30] time you get together and turn him over
[19:33] to the devil for the destruction of the
[19:35] flesh that his spirit is like might be
[19:38] saved in the day of the Lord and watch
[19:41] the whip of God come in watch The Devil
[19:45] take a hold of him that's an evil spirit
[19:47] gets him now isn't that such a
[19:50] interesting thing to study on that it it
[19:52] it would be a good thing to just back up
[19:56] and let let things lay out to bring
[20:00] somebody to a place to where they're
[20:03] like oh
[20:04] God sin took me where I don't want to go
[20:08] I need you that that can actually be
[20:12] love and and you know that that's our
[20:14] problem is that when we see our children
[20:17] doing things wrong you see your kids
[20:18] smoking that weed smoking that joint you
[20:21] see your kids doing something they
[20:22] shouldn't be doing and you endorse it
[20:25] instead of instead of of of getting on
[20:28] your knees and saying God you need to do
[20:29] whatever you need to do to straighten
[20:31] this out but we'll we'll endorse it and
[20:34] Pat them on the back bless him you know
[20:36] do you do you need that iPad do you need
[20:39] you a fancy news something or other and
[20:41] we'll endorse it instead of pulling back
[20:44] and and and letting letting God correct
[20:48] and do what he needs to
[20:50] do now you know sometimes even even
[20:52] little children you know that that that
[20:54] that thing of of pulling back uh
[20:56] sometimes you got to you know you get a
[20:58] little a little kid that that uh they
[21:00] just don't realize that they need to
[21:01] stay away from that fire stay away from
[21:04] that candle but then you'll you all
[21:06] right you you got to learn the hard way
[21:09] and and you just sit you take a step
[21:11] back and you you watch as they reach out
[21:13] that little kid reaches out and touches
[21:15] that candle and and then they learn and
[21:18] and and and it sometimes it takes the
[21:20] hard way for them to learn but turn them
[21:23] over to the devil is when a Believer is
[21:25] persistently living and blatant
[21:27] unrepentant sin the church may be forced
[21:31] to deliver or remove that person from
[21:33] fellowship so that the destruction of
[21:34] the flesh can incur in other words the
[21:36] sinful and carnal part of your their
[21:38] nature is allowed to run its course or
[21:41] or be broken down so that the soul can
[21:44] be
[21:46] saved you see somebody sitting in church
[21:48] and they're they're not living right
[21:50] brother R will say remember Paul what he
[21:51] told them over there this man that
[21:53] wouldn't obey the gospel he said turn
[21:55] him over to the devil for the
[21:56] destruction of his flesh that is soul
[21:58] will be saved that's right now now
[22:01] here's the the thing the kicker is you
[22:03] can't play with God you can't play with
[22:07] you come into church and you expect to
[22:08] say well I'm a Christian I'm a Believer
[22:10] and take communion and then live a hound
[22:12] dog life and that's where the church is
[22:15] just endorsing things and that's where
[22:17] you have a just a mess like the
[22:19] Corinthians did you you can't endorse
[22:21] you can't allow someone to come in
[22:24] living living a hound dog life and then
[22:27] and then just kind of
[22:29] you go by with it being patted on the on
[22:31] the back you can't pet the devil you
[22:34] can't pet the devil you can't allow the
[22:37] devil to get away with with with doing
[22:39] things you can't play with god brother
[22:41] that's that word inspired every word of
[22:44] it lays right straight to the human line
[22:46] that's right you'll either tow the line
[22:49] but if you're ever born of the spirit of
[22:51] God you are a son of God now turn them
[22:54] over to the devil for the destruction of
[22:55] the Flesh and then watch that something
[22:57] begins to take hold just like like um
[23:00] brother Brown I'm going to give examples
[23:01] like brother Ramsey that we'll look at
[23:03] in a moment brother Billy Paul when he
[23:05] the the devil got a hold of him and got
[23:07] him in the hospital bed and then then he
[23:09] was ready to repent and and brother Ram
[23:11] said you did the sin and you do the
[23:13] praying then then you're you're ready
[23:16] you're in a state where your flesh is
[23:19] all broken down and and your your
[23:22] spirit's all in turmoil and you're ready
[23:24] to come back to God the individual is
[23:27] left in the realm of natural
[23:28] consequences without the support of
[23:30] Christian Fellowship that sinful
[23:32] lifestyle will run its course and it
[23:35] often results in severe losses or hard
[23:37] hardships what's that mean without the
[23:39] support of Christian Fellowship that
[23:40] don't mean nobody's nobody's uh talking
[23:43] to you that don't mean that we do like
[23:46] the Amish and put you out or whatever
[23:48] and just dis disassociate from you but
[23:50] but it means that that uh we're not
[23:53] praying uh for maybe the things that you
[23:56] want to be prayed for but we're praying
[23:58] that God will will do something in your
[24:00] life and will will grab a hold of you
[24:02] and begin to mold you and bring you back
[24:05] into the fold and and what it is is not
[24:08] it's not an
[24:13] endorsement it's the purpose is not to
[24:16] abandon the purpose person completely
[24:18] but to remove that enabling environment
[24:21] that might allow sin to
[24:24] flourish now this is really a lesson for
[24:26] us all isn't it because that's our
[24:28] problem problem is we want to we're
[24:30] enablers we want to enable the devil to
[24:32] just run rough shot over us and over our
[24:35] family we'll we'll see our kids uh
[24:38] watching TV shows and things that they
[24:40] shouldn't be and we just enable it we we
[24:43] just we we'll just Pat the devil and let
[24:45] him just do whatever and that's that's
[24:47] what Paul say you can't do that you know
[24:51] uh we we've
[24:53] uh if if the devil if the devil's coming
[24:56] in your house it's time to take a stand
[24:57] and say
[24:58] you got to get out if the devil's coming
[25:01] in your church or whatever and
[25:02] afflicting people it's time to take a
[25:04] stand and say you you can't do that you
[25:06] got to get
[25:09] out I'm trying to find a place to close
[25:12] here this is a big long story brother
[25:14] Ramy I'm I'm not going to read that
[25:15] right now but
[25:17] um I'll read this quote where brother R
[25:20] said in questions and answers and then
[25:21] we'll we'll stop as the musicians come
[25:23] forward he said God telling the holy
[25:25] church which is his body here on Earth
[25:27] that now this is after the holy Old
[25:30] Testament and the new telling a man that
[25:31] was so filthy and dirty amongst the
[25:34] people that he lived with his own
[25:35] father's wife and said such a thing in
[25:38] the body of Christ you Church turn him
[25:40] over to the devil for the destruction
[25:42] see God permits the and when he got
[25:44] something he has to see done to put a
[25:46] whip on somebody he'll turn an evil
[25:48] spirit loose on them so that they'll
[25:50] torment that person and bring them
[25:54] back that's what's the matter with the
[25:57] churches today
[25:59] when a man comes into the body of Christ
[26:02] and becomes one of the members and
[26:04] starts doing evil instead of you all
[26:07] getting together and doing this very
[26:08] same thing and you brandom Tabernacle do
[26:11] that because as long as you're holding
[26:13] him up he's under the blood and he just
[26:16] keeps doing the same old thing over and
[26:19] over and over all the time you get
[26:21] together and turn him over to the devil
[26:23] for the destruction of the flesh that
[26:25] his Spirit might be saved in the day of
[26:27] the Lord and watch the whip of God come
[26:30] in watch The Devil take a hold of him
[26:32] that's a evil spirit
[26:34] guessing God bless you Saints we'll
[26:37] we'll stop right there and we will
[26:38] continue next time
[26:40] [Applause]
