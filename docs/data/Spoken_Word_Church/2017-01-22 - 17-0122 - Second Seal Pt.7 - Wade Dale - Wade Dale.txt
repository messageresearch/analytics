========================================

now last Sunday we kind of we didn't get off the track but we kind of got off the track a little but still it all makes sense when you're talking about the seals right because the seals is what it's a revelation of Jesus Christ it's a revelation that was hidden from man that nobody knew no one knew this except the son of man that's why the son of man had to come back to start revealing himself through a Prophet this time right because he can't come back in flesh and do it himself so he had to go he had to come through a flesh called William Brown to bring us the uh opening of the Seven Seals but but watch Jesus preached them while he was here no one knew that there was no commentator ever God himself had to reveal to William Bram that Matthew 2 four was the seals because now without a revelation to read that all Jesus is doing is he's telling them they ask him what what did they ask him let's go right here tell us when shall these things be what he said one stone won't be on another right the temple he's talking about the temple and they said look at this great glorious Temple he said won't be a stone on top of another one well when will this be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and and of the end of the world so there three things that they asked him and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many well there's your first seal the first seal opened right there in its let let me let me tell you this way it opened in its letter form everybody understand what I'm saying it opened in its letter form it did not open in a full Revelation right everybody got that it was in now he knew it now the son of man knew at this time of his ministry he he knew we're going to talk about that this afternoon about how that that the Bible says that Jesus grew in Grace and knowledge and being made perfect right when now we know his his body is what they're talking about it's not talking about his soul or his Spirit but there is a connection there that Jesus didn't know all things while he was here right now who was and I was looking yesterday or tonight or last night and today how in the world can you read Matthew 17 where Jesus goes up the mountain talks to Moses and Elijah the cloud comes down and says what this is my beloved Son whom I please dwell here you him that's all there's no other commentary and then you see brother randam he says well they were talking to anybody's coming right how do you get that out of that you see what I'm saying you you look at some things and you think how'd that come well it had to come from God that had to be what happened uh and and we're going to do some things couple more Sundays and bring in the dimensions and I I was kind of chuckling to myself yesterday you remember the preacher that came here and preached and used circumstantial evidence okay well you can use circumstantial evidence if it goes to True evidence but you can't use circumstantial evidence and it stays circumstantial evidence and it be wrong right it can be circumstantial until it's proven cuz you have to lead up when you do when a when a lawyer goes up and gives his dissertation to the jury he brings things to light that maybe there's not an exact verbatim quote there's not a Verbatim quote in the in the Bible nowhere that Moses and Elijah spoke to Jesus about coming nowhere but obviously brother random with the mind of God which we should have the same with the mind of God God told him they were talking about his second coming mhm right so you see what I'm saying to us it's circumstantial evidence cuz we have nothing to go on but with God's truth there is no circumstantial evidence because it start you know it has no beginning or end but when you you take you get a revelation it keeps progressing and going it doesn't fall off and say well that must not be right that was just circumstantial in false Doctrine that's true but in the truth of God's word it never will have that that's Eternal right that's Eternal the Eternal Word of God can't be circumstantial evidence so we can use some evidences that we see that are not written cuz what brother R say where the where the where the part that God talks to us is what between the lines okay there's nothing written there seventh seal silence in heaven nothing said why it's already been done it's already been said it's already been finished what he say the seventh seal was the end right so watch so you see right here what I'm leading up to brother the seven seal the end of all things now Jesus preached six Seals All right but he gives him a key this is the this is the typing of the second seal he says but the end is not yet then Paul picks it remember and he goes over and remember the two brothers that were preaching Paul's message they were using that's kind of funny I just thought of that they were using Paul's quotebook remember I told you Sunday afternoon this message without a revelation will kill you because remember a prophet comes and he brings what he brings Revelation condemnation and restoration right his message restored the woman at the widow woman right but it destroyed Jezebel the Elijah the Elijah message that come in right so that's the same way with here if we if we take just a letter of it we'll talk a little bit about it this afternoon but not so much because we got to get up through Jesus's life to where he starts talking with the Pharisees and the Sadducees when John brings it out first John the Baptist calling them Snakes in the Grass vipers you know and then like brother Jean was talking about last night you know you you got to be real re you got to have a lot of resolve to walk up to the religious world the religious leaders of the world and tell them that their daddy is the devil right because they they built their whole life on what they were doing what on the word of Moses right Paul said the letter kth but the spirit of the letter and I'm not interjecting I know that's what he was saying the spirit of the letter is what giveth life cuz I'll I'll read to you this afternoon brother Brown he was talking about the word we say the word was made flesh the word was made dirt the word was made dust because when you go back to Genesis 1 or Genesis 3 God cursed what the ground the dirt the curse was on the dirt not on Adam on the dirt Christ had to come back and become dirt what he cursed he became that to take us back up to get us out of this thing right but the seals are too also for that I will this afternoon okay but look you shall hear wars and rumors of wars now that's happened forever right there's been Wars since Canan Abel that was a war it was a two-man War but it was a war all right but he said You shall hear Wars rumors War now remember the second seal what we talking about red right all right let's before I read that let's let's do one let me let me get one one item out of the way because look let me go back I've been trying to stay away from my notes but I got to get back to them um the first seal shows justification right now what is justification it's a purging of your sins okay yes truly the justification part is kind of it's kind of when you're baptized you're re you're real baptis you know the baptism in the water right we know that's just a a good conscious but something has struck your heart that you need to be clean you need to do what God's telling you to do okay so it's purging and it does justification purged your past sins I don't care what you did back here just if you're truly Justified then you're as white as this board when you ask ask God to forgive you right but now what happens in justification you start sinning again CU that old root of evil that same strand that made you do it is still there it's just that God don't see these right here well what a cleansing what a purging and to me that's what the first seal shows it shows one true and living God because look if you got two Gods you can't you you can't you're not purged right if the devil's in there saying he's God he is your god until God's your God Amen the God of this evil world has blinded your eyes right we were all born 10 folks of the devil but once we're purged our old sins are chopped off that's what the first seal should show you that you're as righteous as God is but you still have more to do all right and then the second seal tells you how to do it because see one's got to build on the other one it's like like Dad said about the the stairs you know you build stairs you don't start here youall know what he's talking about cuz right here is your ground when you start here this is your first step but you let that board stick out a little bit further CU your second board's going to sit right down on the first one right M so the end of the first one is the beginning of the second one the ending of the second one is the beginning of the third one everybody you get that yes all right just give you a little visual so that's what the that's what the seals are to do is to what show us let me put it this way a true revelation of seal seals is to show you that it's already done we've got to back up and see that it's already done but we when Jesus preaches this he's telling them it's already done cuz look there was wars and rumors were see that you be not troubled hold on don't be troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet what all these things but there's more to come right so he was telling them just like Paul there was two people preaching in Paul's day using Paul's quote book they said Paul said the resurrection is over cuz remember Paul says resurrected sit in Heavenly places they were teaching teaching to Soul seven Thunder whatever you want to say this in the message Paul had a message right and there was a false that came out of that message well those two preachers were preaching Paul says Resurrection over mhm Paul said I ain't talking about that he said I'm talking about an out Resurrection remember he goes and explains he's talking about this you know this Resurrection not a physical Resurrection cuz remember Paul says it's not coming in this time remember brother R said he tried to explain to the people that the resurrection is not coming right now Paul could see through a glass Darkly and I'll guarantee you Paul could see The Headstone cuz I'm going to tell you something and we'll read it in a couple Sundays from now what is the right right hand of power what's your right hand of power getting a little ahead of myself but I want to show you when it comes in here excuse me what's the U what's the right hand of power step when Steven well actually we're going to read it Jesus said the son of man when he's risen is going to sit on the right hand of God mhm now when Steven is stoned he said said the heaven open now there's not there wasn't some no he had a vision into another dimension he said I see Jesus S standing on the right hand of God with power now what is that Son of God or son of man that's the son of man so the son of man is the one that sits on the right hand of power why Jesus never said all power and Heaven and Earth been given unto me until his death burial Resurrection Ascension yes now remember he went up then he come back don't touch me I'm not yet ascended then he really went up and what' you do the right hand of power God's always wanted to be in human flesh yes always and Adam and Eve were supposed to produce the body that he lived in hello I got the quotes y brother Bri said eventually Eve would have come to a place to where Jesus Christ's body would have come through Eve he so Eve we're second Eve right right yes so where's Jesus's body supposed to come through but now it's a Min membered body that's right and God's always wanted to have flesh that's why when he was sitting on the right hand of power and he said all power in heaven and earth been given unto me he said it in a flesh body that could eat drink but could had no limitations mhm there's the right hand of power everybody's w't know you know sit here till till you know Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot still why is he connected to Earth Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot St that's you not the round ball you always think when we everybody says Earth you go earth right no Earth no but cuz remember without this Earth being changed first this Earth doesn't have a chance cuz this Earth fell first yes that's why the son of man had to come be human flesh to be made dirt to cleanse that dirt that's like I said last Sunday if you remember he didn't come to clean the womb per se cuz she had seven or eight kids after that you understand you know physically y all understand what I'm saying so it wasn't that he cleaned the womb he approved of what was going on he brought his the beginning of the creation through the womb of Mary but now that the man's grown up and gone it's not the womb of your flesh it's the womb of your heart all right cuz really you know you to be real honest with you you can be a prostitute and then get and get born again well then your wound's clean not your physical one yeah but your spiritual wound all right so you see how this is going to prog rest this is not just this is not just baby form justification baby form sanctification this tells you that you're cleansed this tells you how right this tells you how first seal tells you what the first seal is so important it's what makes you aware where God is and where you are to me that's and then that's true justification those who is Justified he's already glorified right then we come to sanctification where we're talking about a Sanctified body that the blood of Jesus Christ the physical blood doesn't do anything for you it was the Life In The Blood remember the physical blood I'm sure they just dumped water on the cross and the physical blood just ran out on the ground and and and U um dehydrated and you know just went away but the life that was in that blood knowing that he shed that blood for us that's what did it but look take this seal go back to here go to hear you shall hear wars and rumors of wars never been a war fault with that Bloodshed right right even in the spiritual part cuz remember Jesus had to come down here in the flesh though to take away our spiritual warfare yes yes amen so you got to remember that it was the blood that did it the life that was in the blood it did it but the blood is always a representation all right so so this second seal is a representation that that red horse rider went out he went out to do his job and he did it during the Dark Ages right here there was natural war and spiritual war going on cuz brother brand says millon 68 million Christians were killed during the Dark Ages you know that's a third of the population of the United [Music] States that's probably California Florida New York City totally wiped off the mouth not a person in them all dead so you think wars and rumors of wars happened and then brother Brown said Untold billions spiritually dead because of the spiritual warfare cuz you know what it started here and it never stopped it never really stops until the Battle of dog and meog cuz remember the AR the battle of Armageddon is a natural battle the battle of go and Magog is a spiritual battle demons is not going to die in the battle of Armageddon they just going to be put in a place where they can't do anything then they're going to be be released but the spiritual battle the battle of go and Magog God's going to kill those Spirits cuz he's the only one that can kill them he's the one that made them he's the one that can kill them right but you'll hear wars and rumors of War see that you be not trouble and truly to me remember what I said about sanctification being a a horrible a wonderful place to be but a horrible place to be why you're Waring you don't have the Holy Ghost yet now this is way back down you you don't have the Holy Ghost yet but you're Sanctified God's cleaning you up you're going to church you're doing things your desires are different than you've ever had before and you got these thoughts in your mind of of God and about what he's done for you right right did you not have wars I mean we still have wars now but I mean to me that was really a war because Satan comes in on this horse and he says don't worry everything's fine you got it don't worry everything's fine I didn't turn something everything's fine don't worry about it you're okay don't you feel religious yes don't you feel good now you feel like you been for a while ecclesiastical rabbit that's right yeah yeah something here and there what brother Brown said that's right but now now watch though remember the scripture in Matthew the unclean Spirit goes out of a man walks in dry places excuse me seeketh rest findeth none comes back cu the Cup's not full yet I was talking about last Sunday the Cup's not full yet and it's not sealed cups got to be full and sealed grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are what sealed until the day of your Redemption all right cuz if you don't seal it guess what will happen if that cup tips over all that just spild right out brother the way but that ceiling takes place down at Faith that's correct that sealing takes place at the new birth that's grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption that's why I said last Sunday remember hold that word Redemption cuz everything everything God did was to redeem us back and I believe I I believe what brother Jean said there was a there was a place I'm sorry Lord but this is the mind of God that's where we all were we were in the Supernatural Mind Of God right and he wanted children so he brought Adam and Eve to do the job well they you know what happened to that so he came himself with me and you in that mind of that man called Jesus and he was there sure sure he said I come to my own but the Bible said he went to his own his own receive him not so he turned to the Gentiles but he never forgot Israel he's going to still get 144,000 he's still going to redeem a lot you know the first first church age was mostly Jews anyway 120 Upper Room were all Jews the 3,000 downstairs were mixed a little bit but it was mostly a Jewish uh Paul oh all led him so he was a Jew right right so he led them now these that come up a little bit more you're getting more Gentiles cuz you really don't see any more Jewish you see Jewish roots but when the tree tree grew up it was Gentile because it's a nation so CU see the next seal we're going to see Nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom which is a natural and then we got to look at the spiritual part just like this you shall hear wars and rumors of War see that you be not trouble you're going to have them this Jesus is really telling them said look this is what's going to happen but don't worry about it don't worry about it be not troubled for all these things must come to pass must come to pass all right so they're coming they're already here but then they're like he said they're already here but they're coming you think all this is going on now he said Jesus did he said this is nothing the end is not yet you going to it's going to get worse right now Nation again you know wars and rumors of wars can be a small battle but nations against Nations you're talking bigger Kingdom against Kingdom famines pestilence earthqu and D place so to to be in this Sanctified condition is a good condition to be in but it's a horrible condition you say well what about now that we're talking about the second seal this is as we were talking before last Sunday L had a question so we're going to we we're going to show and I think I preached it a long time ago and I may have to go back over again but we're going to use justification sanctification and the Holy Ghost everybody okay with that cuz that's what puts you in the body right here at Faith right according to the prophet's message and according to the Bible Paul Peter says add to your faith virtue and it says having the divine nature add to your fa okay there's only one divine nature and it ain't the guy that's on that horse right there no no it's the Holy Ghost all right you get the Holy Ghost you start here at Faith as a baby right baby but then you go to truly go through the statute of perfect man you got to do it again cuz remember right here what does that say holy ghost right then now we're talking about the seals we're up here to where we do it again three Perfection right justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost but three stages of justification three stages of sanctification three stages of the baptism the Holy Ghost this is the baby this is my beloved Son whom I pleased to dwell we'll talk about that this afternoon Jesus went through everything just like we go through it he didn't need it but he did it for me and you all right then he cuz remember you got to you got to see this this is the body of Jesus right just right okay that's what came on the day of Pentecost the holy ghost in the Believers right yes to put them at Faith the 3,000 but the others that had it they had already been tutored by the word himself to come to this place the 120 okay but this is building the body on this rock I'll build my church now what is the church the church is not the head the church is the body yes but brother Brandon we it took a messenger it took a messenger to come to show us that the head and body must unite cuz all during the church ages they never talked about that headstone was what rejected but you know what Jesus it's not over here it's right here he become the chief of the Cornerstone Chief Cornerstone that everything built up to that comes up to what that the head and the body will Unite well it brings back what the intelligence brother brandham said many times he said I had to go back and listen to the tape he said somebody said I said something and I didn't know I said it why did he not know he said it God was talking that's right yes amen God was talking and that's what we got to come to the son of man Ministry was God talking now the Son of God Ministry let's just be real honest a lot of it was man talking God didn't tell him to baptizing name father son Holy Ghost right that horse rider did the one that rode right here right here right cuz that's when it developed during that long Church age right there is when the doctrines of the Roman Catholic church and the others Baptist Methodist what see they've got their Foundation but their Foundation wasn't built on Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being Chief Cornerstone their their Foundation was built on man's ideas and then what they do they built up a church to where now it's going to be so close Judas and Jesus set at the same table all 11 disciples were deceived Jesus and Judas were the only two people that knew who they were mhm Judas didn't come in he wasn't the number 13 Outsider right he was number well I don't even know say number 12 he always list him last in the Bible I guess cuz it says Judas Carri Judas is car who de who you know sold the Lord out did you say there are also three stages in The Headstone absolutely sure there are what are they I mean justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost yeah absolutely we taugh that brother taught that for years and years and years years and years that that's the Redemption to it is that right that's it cuz this that here is body hey look your Soul's already redeemed Soul's redeemed right here right you've just got so much you got to learn just like Jesus did Jesus was God Almighty in human flesh and until he was we're going to talk about it today you see him at 13 and you don't see him no more till 13 there's things he had to go through that we're going to assume or or use circumstantial evidence to show that he was learning how to live in a human body God had never learned to live in a human body before not alone he tried to get into body he's in the body now but he had to come himself they listen there was nobody else in there but him listen I'm telling you there's things that that we have to realize that that God had to did what he did and he had to work through a human natural setting that's why we won't get to it this Sunday but maybe in a couple more Sundays that's why he lived so close to human life that they didn't believe he was God they watched him he ate corn in the field but everything he did was not contrary to the word it was contrary to their idea right and that's the thing now we do a lot of things that's contrary to God but we think right that's why it takes these seals to separate bring the headstone back into power to where that this justification we got to know that we didn't do it brother Brown come to a place he said the real you didn't do it Jesus came to a place to where when he said I must be about my father's business at 13 years old he separated himself from the family cuz remember after that you know they could say well your sisters and your brothers are here he said who are my sisters and my brothers who is my mother you ye are my brothers and my sisters brother Brown comes up to the communion 1965 he said found I wasn't a son of Charles NE Brown same thing he came to a place not denying who he was Jesus knew he came through the womb of Mary of course but he was about his father's business from that point forward cuz he didn't go back and start building doors we'll read it cuz I got quotes where brother Brown said he didn't go back and start building doors and windows cuz if he' have been about his father's business natural he went back with Joseph but the Bible does say he went back and was subject to him from then on so see there was a human body that was God Almighty and he was subject to to human why he had to be the example child he couldn't been a A rstout or or a rebel he no he was subject to his parents we we get into this half minute that's right but you shall hear War's rumor listen this son of man is not what everybody thinks it is everybody in this message think you get to right hearing buddy you can't do no wrong you ain't got no evil thought when when you look in the bank account if you got $2 all all of a sudden it's 20,000 or if you got you know God can do that if he wants to but sorry H that but you understand what I'm saying everybody's looking at as we go up it's more of sinless perfection that people talk about but remember when Jesus came off that mountain fully knowing everything that he needed to do on Earth from six that brother Brown said 6 months later he was dead and that was the worst 6 months because he would go in that Temple they threw him out they didn't like him anymore they didn't want anything to do with him right um there's not a lot of healings after that see we'll get into that there that Healing Ministry you can take brother Brown's Ministry just like this you got Jesus he healed thousands probably Millions he healed and all of a sudden you don't see him doing that much anymore right he lays into them Pharisees he lays into them Sadducees you see brother brandom he comes in he starts preaching the word a little bit but he's Healing The Sick casting out Devils raising the dead but when he comes to that 3 and 1/2 year Min stream 20 people in a trailer well see brother rman I think I I can't think I kept that quote he said Jesus would speak to 5 and 6,000 he said he got down to 170 he said he got down to 40 it got down to 12 and it got down to three and then when he went to Calvary it was one he knew what he's supposed to do Calvary is not a place where you have a lot of joy and peace and you understand what I'm saying same thing with us it's not going to look so to the world that cuz remember if the son of man Ministry let me say one more time if the son of man Ministry is here like it was then they're going to look at you and say if you be God if you be God do this if you be God do that come down come out of that tribulation it's what they were saying to Jesus on the cross if if you who you say you do come down off the cross come down that from that tribulation come down from what's been but we know that he see now we don't have to get on a cross anymore he's already been there we don't have to go but we will have tribulations cuz we'll hear wars and rumors of wars but the true justification and sanctification in The Headstone is no more this has got a lot of man's ideas in it I'm sorry it does it has leaven yes it has leaven in it it has something added got it even the first Pentecostal that came up right here the first Pentecostal that came up in the in the U Lan Church age trinitarian got it so God winked at that he's not winking right here this is the full manifestation of Jesus Christ on the earth just like it was th000 years ago same sign same wonders same manifestation and what is manifestation making known the same thing he said I do nothing except the father shows me so you see that Holy Ghost right there is a body change to me brother BR said there'll come such a baptism that will fill every fi of our being and take us inter rapor well we only have the Holy Ghost in our soul but now what's working on is our spirit going up to the statue of perfect man right and then the same thing here but what's going to happen is is you got to remember we're not going to this is not just exactly like this because remember Jesus had to have a body change right yes so we are going to we're not going to what I'm saying is Under The Headstone we're not going to our Feet's not going to get glorified first then our body I mean then our waist and then you see I'm talking about it's going to be an instant thing we're going to be changed in the moment twinkling of an eye brother BR said this thing right here will be saky till the day of the change the day of the change but boy when you get changed I'll guarantee you you can say just like Jesus all power and Heaven and Earth been given unto me cuz that's what God's always wanted he's not always wanted the power MH God not selfish remember he said Adam first first man he made hey he said Earth's yours you control the Earth I'll control Heaven what he been he's want to get same thing with you and I speak my word he's not going to come down here and physically speak it he's going to come down here and physically speak it through you all of us we need to go by the way yes that but that justification sanctification Holy Ghost and that headstone is that after um Mount Transfiguration that is correct this is you cannot you cannot see this without being adopted no way you're you're still down here you're still here and what I'm saying is you're in a position adoption is not down here adopting is why brother bradam and Lord Jesus are only two people that I know were adopted even Paul wasn't adopted cuz there was things that he didn't see but when you come up to here when brother Ram went out to Arizona he said he said God will take you what go to on the back out of a desert visit you with an angel give you something for the people well that's exactly what happened in Arizona God took him up a mountain Vis him with seven angels give him a message and said here ye him and he put that sign in the sky the one with the with the cloud at the confirmation cuz Jesus told him them two angels said hey you see the son of man leaving he said in the cloud he said he's coming back in the same way right and Matthew he says he said why you looking up he said that same Jesus who just went up you going to see him right back down here on Earth again but he's going to be hidden his people the world will see me no more but you'll see me cuz I'll be with you even in until the end the world get out of here
