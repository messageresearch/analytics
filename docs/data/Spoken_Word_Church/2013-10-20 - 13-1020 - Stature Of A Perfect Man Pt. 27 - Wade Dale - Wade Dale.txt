TRANSCRIPT
========================================
then we don't want we don't want the knowledge of this world now I was thinking this morning brother randam never you know everybody well you need to take the kids we we come through that era where when you turned 16 years old they pulled you out of school and sent you to work because brother Brown said education was of the devil yet all of his children graduated school and even Billy Paul went to Bible College so it's like Dad said yesterday we were talking coming home from Hinton he said U if we don't get the essence of the message there's enough quotes in the message there are enough quotes that's going to kill you and it will quotes will kill you if you don't have the new birth there we go if you don't have a new birth to do what discern and that's what we're talking about with knowledge to me knowledge is summed up in one word discernment now you can have discernment and not be able to write your name Peter did right here Peter was couldn't even write his name yet he had discernment on the day of Pentecost God used an ignorant fisherman to bring the gospel right Peter was the first one Peter was the first spokesman he walks out and says hey this Jesus whom you've crucified he preached him a good sermon right but he didn't know how to write his name but you know what as in human knowledge brings you what experience or experience brings you knowledge both works both ways all right in in the human realm knowledge brings experience experience brings knowledge now I've seen some people that were 60 years old that were still kids in their brain Susan said I got one said you shook your head I mean you're the one taking your head up I got a couple I got a couple Susan's got children running all over the place is grayhead but now look yeah he com yeah right get out of that one you hear that Dy but anyway but no really I have honestly and you have too you've seen people that were 60 years old that were so immature and just make you sick well that's human immaturity all right but now I've seen people that were in their 20s that you could learn something from if you just listen to them because they had some good things to say and that's just worldly knowledge but nothing ever beats experience nothing nothing beats being there nothing beats going through it nothing beats having a knowledge of you've been there you know you can sister Johnny can sit here and and as and as let me put this right as colorful as she is good word as colorful as she really and I mean she's very expl she explains things very well okay she could sit down and explain to me Time Square what what's another one oh um U what's the big old Gardens up there the Central Park Central Park she could you've been to Central Park all that see she know and she can just you know why you know why she's been there but see she can tell me and just be so vivid she can tell me the trees are beautiful and the the grass is green and and she can even tell me how to get there but you know what it's just that I have I have somebody else's word for it right now let's apply this to the spiritual part brother brand message is hearsay until it's revealed to you now want get that right hears say it's something a man said unless it's taken through the filter of your knowledge that's right and if you have human knowledge just human knowledge brother brand said you'll fight it all the time human knowledge puts people with the father son Holy Ghost baptism human knowledge brings a trinity cuz remember Godly knowledge never brings that Godly knowledge is over here pure and right and and nothing wrong with this with God's knowledge okay but we take our knowledge of what man's ideas cuz it was man's ideas that brought a father son Holy Ghost baptism it wasn't God it was man's idea that brought a trinity not God so we've got to take and you know what God will Wink in our ignorance when we can't really see one true and living God like we we should he'll Wink in our ignorance but he he would that all of us what come to um let's read these right here in in Timothy I like the way Paul puts it let's go to 1 Timothy 2 Timothy is a hard one for me to find yeah it's right after the one other one I can't find Thessalonians right after Thessalonians that I can't find but in the scoffield Bible it's 1275 but go to 1 Timothy 2 and 4 let's start with verse one I exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers and intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all that are in Authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty now this is Paul right for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior who will have all men who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth now watch what he's saying for there is one God and one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified and due time so he would that all come to the knowledge of Truth now he didn't he he finished that thought go to 2 Timothy 3:7 second Timothy he wrote the second letter and he still got the same thoughts but he's bringing these people in as being all those ugly things up above there you see that without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers those that are good traitors he High minded L Pleasures more lovers of God having a form of godliness look at verse seven ever learning human knowledge trying to reason out God's word human knowledge ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth all right so that's where we go back to our definition of knowledge is discernment You' got to ear to me when the Bible says pray without ceasing to me I want to take that word and put discern in there you discern without ceasing cuz as you what do you pray about what do you pray about a choice what you pray about somebody's going through a problem somebody I'm going through a problem I'm going what discernment you know you know brother Dale can discern a lot of things that goes on by the way he sees you out that's right and he doesn't have to know the details but what does he do he goes to praying as an intercessor he's not a pope he's not a priest like that but he's he does intercede for you okay what did he do he has discernment not just discern right and wrong you should discern right and wrong down at Faith cuz remember there's only one sense in that inner realm Faith or doubt you have to discern which one is in your soul right now okay Faith or doubt you say well I I still doubt well just be careful just be careful when you use that word if you just say well well I just doubt everything but he's talking about the word of God right if you're doubting the word of God you don't have the new birth because the new birth is the birth of the word which is God right which is the perfect discernment all right so you got take that and look and see there's there's there's knowledge that you use in the Bible that's human knowledge and brother brandham talks about human knowledge and then there's knowledge of the Lord are the knowledge of the truth not knowledge of a truth we have a knowledge of a bunch of a truths that's right but we won't we need to have if you're born again that starts in baby form a knowledge of the truth and I want I would love them to put the in capital letter a knowledge of the truth brother said you have a knowledge on the Revelation but if you have a knowledge that is the Revelation it's the same it's one you're not wondering all right that's what knowledge does to me the third one up Faith Faith or doubt you're either born in or you're not you're not halfway there like brother Brown said you're not a half pregnant woman you're either expecting or you're or not all right so you're either impregnated with the word or you're not one of the two you got to figure that out but it is in a baby form everybody understand that this is a baby form this Holy Spirit right here is not a baby form that's right that's almost a full grown man right all right or woman okay but right here that's baby form Faith that's where Paul's talking about drinking the sincere milk of the word mhm cuz you got to have start you got to start with milk all right that's what I said then you got to go to Virtue add to what you believe virtue strength not only that people can draw strength from you but that you have inter strength for yourself okay and then you got to have knowledge what discernment that discernment is really uh you take Temperance and patience and godliness you better have some knowledge coming up there some discernment mhm or you'll trip up cuz brother Brandon really doesn't talk a whole lot about knowledge but he goes to Temperance and patience and you watch him in this in the Statue of a perfect man book he'll say right here's where we fall off he didn't say virtue he didn't say knowledge he got up to Temperance and patience and he said right here's where we fall off or here's where we fall short so he knew that Temperance and patience was going to have he's going to have to have a real wide strong Foundation that's right of Faith virtue because you know what if you have Godly knowledge it'll help your Temperance and your patience cuz what are you doing you're Discerning right you Discerning whether you used to smack the guy in the mouth or you know run your mouth to the to the to the woman or the neighbor or whatever that's right but if you got a knowledge of the truth in you that says hey without God I'd be just like that person that's right that's true without God I'd be just like that person that's right that's what daddy's been telling us when we come into that human but that human body is an animal body it reacts to to animal nature what brother Brown said right this is animal and without the holy ghost man is what same as a brute Beast same thing now he's got a soul that he's got to be judged by don't get me wrong but he is a brute Beast you see it now did you see the other day where that principle in a school was raping a boy while his parents were sitting out in the lobby oh yeah I mean how stupid and how how overwhelming this power is that Satan has on people now Hey listen brother Brown said in the 50s that we were one click away from Insanity one click which means one one little clip one little turn I think we've went all through that turn but remember we got to be just like Sodom and Gomorrah those sodomites tried their best to get drag those angels out they did men right that's right and do something with them and lot got so caught up and read the Bible it's pretty tough lot said here take my daughters here take my daughters and lot was a righteous man B what the Bible said but see it vexed his righteous Soul he was what was he was trying to do right but he was in the wrong environment remember Abraham stayed in the right environment same way with you and I that's right we got to live in this sodomite World Lord we got to live in it but we don't have to be partakers of it all right it says ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth why they never got born again that's the whole thing if they would have got born again they would have become into the knowledge of the truth and at least had a little understanding of what was going going on okay I think in the preaching today in Sunday School in these days and Sunday school I find that I'm Discerning my actions and reactions continuously yeah that's what I mean the Bible says pray without ceasing well you can't close your eyes and pray but prayer to me is discernment like I said if you're praying about a situation or you're praying about a person what are you doing you're Discerning whether they need prayer or not whether God needs to change that situation or not right brother Brandon remember he had a problem with that remember he said I have to be able to discern this is not exact quote but he in other words he was telling the people I have to be careful because God put something on a person right to straighten them up remember and he said I've prayed it off and got in trouble with God why because God honors the prayer first he honors the prayer of a righteous man aileth much ises that what the scripture says prayer of a righteous man our woman ath much right so he prayed that all he says I have to be careful discern be careful what I'm doing with what God gave cuz see God gave him that gift it was his to operate it was his cuz remember brother Brown said this is my eye God gave it to me now he didn't say those little things just for just for filling up tape space but remember God gives you the Holy Ghost it's now yours it's not his anymore it's yours it's a possession it's yours you have it it's your Holy Ghost all right it's him in another form but still it's yours because if it's not yours it's somebody else's or it's not even yours to start with that listen gra B like sister who died sister B and it is a confusion a friend or said probably that is correct because what he done was he heard something different and started praying for a sister over here see if and but it was Sister Bell's time to go home right but God knew if he heard that sister Bell's name and started praying for her he would have to answer that prophet's prayer right right so see what did God do God didn't change brother Brown's mind brother B heard just a different name you know brother bam even said he said God didn't tell me when my mother was dying or going to die he didn't tell me that my father was dying see there's things that God don't tell you cuz you know what as human beings it would drive us crazy it drove him crazy enough shaking people's hands and seeing Devils all over the place and knowing that they liked him and didn't like him and all that stuff but you know what he had a knowledge of the truth and now that's what he brought to me and you he had the but that knowledge of the truth and we'll get into it sometime maybe next year that Capstone of love I want you to know one thing for sure and I want you to think about this this right here is a little pyramid right that's a little pyramid of this so all this in its super form is right there right anybody got that remember how brother NE taught and how I teach it justification satification baptism of the Holy Ghost justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost you got to go through all that and then you don't stop you go through the highest form cuz this person didn't do it this one did this person down here did it you did you know you did it cuz you was there but that Capstone of love that person never done it that's the Justified Justified I never done it in the first first place all right that's what this is driving out it's driving out the old person all right but all these gifts don't just stay down here all these gifts in their Apex form is in this right here everybody understand what I'm saying everybody got it it's just a higher form of this you never lose any of these in your human form got it cuz this is the statue of a perfect man all right cuz all this guess what's going to happen with all this it's going to be in its total Apex form when we get out of here you're still going to have faith you're not going to lose Faith no what did Brother Brown said what' God do he just believed he could do it he said let there be let that what you and I are supposed to do create a world go live on it cuz we got the Creator in US virtue knowledge Temperance patience all that St sure it's going to be under control but we got to get it under control down here because it's just going to be highest form up there everybody understand that you know you don't lose things when you go to heaven you gain you gain things what Dad and I were talking about yesterday people people are on to this well I was born with this eternal life and I don't have to do this that the other well now of course we don't agree with that at all the Bible doesn't agree with that and the prophet's message doesn't agree with it if you read it right right but if I have the new birth I can look back to all those things before the foundation of the world how I was in the mind of God how that my attribute was before the world was and how that I was preaching last Sunday on the DNA of the Holy Ghost well the Holy Ghost was the creator Christ the lamb the Holy Ghost brother BR said was the same person so who created the world Christ right but now Paul said it's who in you the Creator in you that's right the hope of glory so that's why brother Brown said you could create a world and go live on it because what's inside you in other words knows how to do it but there's a bar there which is a human bar we're down here we don't need to go make another world and live on it but we're a Creator we're still a little Creator Even in our lower form remember how brother B said you can create a situation you can change a situation he went in and his wife with all you know and and the prophet put on an apron and went to work I've told you I've told you the best way to get what you want from a woman is to put on an apron grab a broom and a mop Kendrick pay attention you ain't got hey you ain't got to adverti it don't be walking around no yard with no no no apron on all right inside the house but what did he do brother Brown Put on an apron started helping her with the dishes started putting the kids he giving them the toys and he said what 15 minutes later he said it was just a hole what was it it was the one inside of him what would have we done woman hurry up and get my yeah kids hurry up and can't you shut them kids up you know I mean but what did he do he never raised his voice he just went in and you know started helping him and that's the same way with knowledge knowledge to me is discernment and that is 24/7 that's right that's that's to me that's praying without ceasing when you see that word pray without ceasing put the word discern in there cuz you're Discerning without ceasing you're ever deser every day that's right somebody cuts you off on the freeway you used to Des you used to not discern at all that's right you just reacted gave them the one finger wave you know or give them one of these or got ill about it you know but now what do you do I hope you still don't do that John how colorful you know you try to do I I I do try and the light you know how some people when they see the light turn yellow and if you're so far from The Edge I mean from the light you know you going have to stop this person behind me sto going I know what you wanted I got so angry I said I wish the I had a microphone where I could see I fly over me I got so angry well that's okay I mean you didn't bent to them you didn't get out of the car and do what you know you see them guys on a motorcycle the other day on it on the internet too New York in New York they were just this man was just really minding his own business with his family had a kid in the car and they the motorcyclist thought they had the road so they pulled out and stopped in front of him and he bumped one and Buddy after that it just escalated yeah he run over one of them and but he they pulled him out and beat him right there in front of the wife and the kids now what do you do in that situation number one don't go to New York and all you New Yorkers I'm sorry I just I know no after about six maybe but if I can get that other clip in I might get the rest from church on uh Sunday these two guys wasac together and they got so angry each other they got the car shot each other both yeah I read about that they didn't have a g they now look there's a there's see this is where discernment comes in like if if you would have been driving that car and your wife and kids and you weren't provoking or hurting anybody now if a guy comes up and takes his helmet and drives it through my windshield I'm going to shoot that man and I ain't going to shoot him in the belly cuz I have done nothing you but see you got to discern that okay it's like Daddy said he said somebody breaks in your house and starts getting on and you got kids and your wife in the house shoot them I mean he's a brute Beast he's either on something or you know but you know what we do we pray that God doesn't ever put us in that but if he ever does but if he ever does it's something for you that's right you're going to give that person something but it's something for you to help you to discern cuz you know what he said he'd never put no more on you then you can stand you got boy sometimes you get when to back off that's correct well see without Holy Ghost knowledge or or even Temperance and patience what are you going to do you're going to go on over the edge and possibly kill somebody that's correct and what the knowledge of God is doing now is is even in a situation we know when to stop yeah cuz I mean those two didn't know and I remember Sister Johnny brought up a good point they were just road rage so they got some M they bumped each other and pulled off on side of the road and they both pulled about guns and they killed each other best thing to do if somebody does that to you just go on because you never know what kind of idiots driving that car you know what kind of person driving your car but you don't know what kind of person driving your car of their car just don't put yourself in that situation but with Holy Ghost knowledge you'll say God if it wasn't for you I'd beat that kid to death or I'd beat that person up and you know what to me when you walk away from that that gives you more satisfaction than if you had have done it for sure I think so cuz I told the church over and just before we go listen listen to this what about these people that are preaching that you always was eternal you didn't need nothing that you you you're predestinated and you're predetermined and that's what you're going to be and you have no choice now how would you like to live that to me that would be a zombie that would be something that you're just walking through life and or what about knowing you were lost knowing you were going to hell knowing that you were doing things wrong and then God comes down and says hey be my child what a redeemer What A Savior I want to be saved from this guy amen this is the person I want to get saved from right here and if I can get saved from this person everything's all right all right let's go all right we'll talk a little bit more about knowledge and then we'll get into Temperance next Sunday I just want to know with temp is okay okay to what if it's not sister you pray for me yeah
