we're going to talk about the a man a little more this afternoon we're going to get a little bit more into uh indepth into the adoption and the placing part but today we're just going to kind of this morning we're going to kind of U get everybody caught back up so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day thank you for your presence Lord that we we felt during the song service now Lord I pray that you would sanctify us all Lord the hearers and the speakers be with the sick ones ones that are not here Lord we ask you be with the missionaries on the Foreign Fields be with the ones Lord that are that can't get out Lord that are watching in online Lord I pray that you'd give them a special anointing also I know they want to be here Lord but sometimes in the body Lord we have things that bother us Lord and I pray that you'd just help each one father just be with us now in the fur of this service sanctify us for this journey forgive us of our many faults and mistakes that we make Lord may we sit down just a few minutes and hear from you in Jesus name we pray amen we're on part 136 in in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the word I know y'all can't read that sorry I'm trying to hurry up it took too much time and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that better wait a minute that's better and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we what we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John 16:12 says I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be how be it when he the spirit of Truth as like brother uh Vernon was talking about this past weekend the continuity of the word it just continues to carry on it doesn't have to carry on in one vessel it carry on in in several different vessels Jesus knew he was leaving he knew that they weren't understanding what he was saying but he knew that when the spirit of Truth come and would enter them on the day of Pentecost that Peter James and John would be the spokesman then it would go to Paul then it go to arenus and continue to this day right here all right this is Jesus speaking how be it when he the spirit of Truth what he the Holy Ghost is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak remember he's talking through the bride and to the bride and he will show you things to come you may be seed it he'll show you Revelation that's what we're looking for revelation we live on Revelation we thrive on Revelation and even New Birth is a revelation all right so we're looking at the Revelation that we are the sons and daughters of God right now we know we can go into before the foundation of the world and all that which is fine but that's in the mind of God we're right here today in flesh we're human beings and if we're not born again we're lost there's not an in between okay all right so brother B says when you must be born again said you're still once you were until you're actually born again of the spirit of God in other words those Creeds doesn't change you as brother Bob said you know somebody saying that you need to go to church that's not going to change anybody cuz the same people keep stand out so so it's got to be God get a hold of you so I pray that God gets a hold of all of us today that he gets a hold of all of us and he does a work and he will convict us and when he convicts us you remember at your new birth the preacher didn't convict you the Holy Ghost convicted you and brought you to the altar you say oh well it was through a vessel sure it was through a vessel of preaching and a vessel of bringing the anointing down and and a vessel of opening up and saying hey you need to be born again but it wasn't that preacher's voice that bed you it was God inside of you is what bed you amen when he said you're a child of mine I can tell you that all I want to but that's not going to do you any good your mama your daddy your preacher everybody anybody can say yeah you're a child of God but until God says you're a child of God secondhand information and it can be wrong right but not from God it's not so the new birth is an experience something that takes place or something that we go through that we understand in this church it's justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost brings you to the New Birth because you can and and yesterday I was thinking about something going on in the world and all and I thought Lord you know that's no it was it was this morning I was thinking about and it was anointed ones and they're they're Anointed with the true holy ghost it's not the the Holy Ghost is not false never has been never will be but it can anoint you and your fults that's what we're living under now but if you get the new birth in your soul the Holy Ghost can't be leading you and you be false that's right it's truth and truth all right mechanics Dynamics they all got to come together you got to have two pieces to vulcanize got to have two pieces of rubber to vulcanize all right so the new birth is an experience something that takes place so it's not that thing that brings the new birth in other words come to church and and the dos and don'ts that we talk about all the time it's what I tell you one brother said he and he's just plain as he could be he said you will not have to tell a holy ghost filled person to go to church you're not preaching the Holy Ghost fill people that they don't go to church they just ain't got the Holy Ghost you be quiet if you want to but it's truth how in the world you going to sit home and the Holy Ghost Inside of You says I got to go hear what's going on and be among a brother and sister and be among be in a fellowship and be in a assemble yourself together right and we can make all kind of excuses but there is none now brother Brown tells us he says I hope the church and we'll talk about this a little more this afternoon because the the Bible tells us that he is the head of the body of the church yes all right well now that has to be separated because not all church is church not all church is Bride come on but but we had a prophet comeing the end time to what rightly divide the word of Truth this is truth this is error this is the church this is the bride he separated them out all right because what the word is a discerner of the thoughts intense of the heart just like brother B could stand and say you're from so and so place and you drive a red car and you I mean he the doctor had on a red coat I mean he just was so vivid why cuz it was a vision he was watching television all right he was watching what was going on and that was because the word of God had come to a prophet and had opened up that Dimension well I pray to God that God opens up a dimension in our life today not so much that I got to see what's in your life or what's in my life that will determine itself as brother Bob was talking about keep watching the life keep watching what it produces all right now we have our ups and downs and we can be critical and non-critical but let's just what consider the end of your conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so now we see a church we we keep reading in the Bible about a church but there's a prophet came in the end time he said now I'm going to call you Bride on the first seal when that first seal is getting ready to open he sees where the white horse rider is he sees Us in the church huh he sees us in the church but he also sees it riding away from him in his Revelation the white horse rider he said here stands the lamb and there goes the white horse rider well what was riding off the pretense of the church the falseness of that denominational cuz he stands there one day and he says now I know why I hate denominations cuz it's a nickeled and spirit and God hates nickeled and spirit so do we all right you know denominational ideas can be can come in many forms you can't say well the Baptist and the Methodist and the Pentecostal right look at some of their Tendencies and you see some of the Tendencies trying to creep back in the church I'm going to preach anyway but it has we sit we listen and we go home and we just keep going over and over again and we bind the church we bind the spirit of the church by the way we Act think but there's a bride she's without spot or wrinkle she's going to be perfect she's righteous just as righteous as he is so never since Jesus Christ was on this Earth has Satan has such a formidable opponent he doesn't know what to do with us right now there's times when he does oh yeah hey reach take your finger and pinch yourself right here okay the devil just pinch you on the hand but he he's got a formidable opponent inside and now we're trying to work that thing out to where the Cornerstone can become The Headstone not just in a building but in you right we're talking about me and you we're not talking about the world we I wish that I'm like I'm like the Lord I wish that all would be saved don't you look at people and say oh man if you could just get saved just just get salvation but God knows it will he knows it won't you just got to present it to him number one in what in your life in 1965 brother Brown on the rise in the sun he said there has been churches churches Brides brides there has been Brides there been bride listen Jesus Jehovah was married to the Old Testament Jews and we're going to read something here in just a few minutes where Jesus stands one day and he says you had all this The Headstone is here you rejected it but I'm going to give it to a nation that'll receive it and that's the Gentiles he took it from the Jews and give it to us praise God we'll reading it in a minute where Jesus was standing there telling them in other words I was married to you remember we read it long long when we first got started he says I was married to you but you went whing in other words what you took a horse forehead or you took a denominational idea contrary to the word of God all right right you know people try to sit in church and bind church that's a denominational Spirit right when you bind the freedom of the ministry you are you have a denominational spirit all right we need to get rid of that Bel look brother said back there's got to come one so he's honing it down just like that thing is being honed in me and you the prophet of God is honing it down he's a he's a master builder remember he types zerubabel in the Bible about building and all those things he was a master builder Elijah Elijah was a builder remember they destroyed the whole they destroyed the whole Tabernacle well not the Tabernacle but the altar he put them all back together then that's when the fire fell all right but it's got to come one Hallelujah there's got to come a real bride so then you've got now a false bride and a real bride cuz you're going to have to have Satan's bride oh he's got a bride yeah he just don't know how to get to do things do things like he wants them done bless his heart he is listen if you'll just break it all down he has no control over nothing nothing we listen what's our greatest Mountain what's our greatest fear death God allows you to die when he allows you to die not when Satan says no I think I'm going to take them today no God said no hang on minute that's right no not today not I have a plan I have a purpose amen I have something to do with my children and then maybe I'm going to take them home see that's the way I see it and I I've said it at many funerals same way with if you're a holy ghost filled person today I don't believe the death angel comes and picks you up that's a death angel oh well brother we die no the Bible says no Christians can't die they don't die they just move into another place I like what brother Donnie rean you know he lost his daughter a couple weeks ago and he preached one sermon called why which was wonderful and then he preached last week about an update on Erica which is his daughter that passed away he said I want to let you know since she's moved come on so you can think about what what went on in the sermon she's moved she's she's gone to another place and it was wonderful you ought to go see it sometime he is a good Minister but there must come one that not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics makes the church live move in the power of Resurrection until we come to that place look till we come to that place what good is it the Polish of hubs all right what good is it to make that car look good if it ain't got anything in it to drive it all right so Hebrews 4 and 12 the Bible says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword so the word of God is what's going to loose us yes from our sins or loose us from our ideas and from our thoughts that's why the word of God has been disrespected and put out of the denominational World they don't want God remember he's outside trying to get in huh amen that's what it says in our church age behold I stand at the what door and knock and if anyone will let me in in other words there got to be somebody on this side of the door and many people will not reach and get the door knob and let him in but we have praise God we have made we have been made an given an entrance as we were talking about the other day an Open Door yes it's all open now there's nothing hi everything's out in the open piercing even to the dividing of sun of Soul and Spirit we see where the prophet of God was the only one that could pull that thing apart and show us cuz it was a mind of God yes God wanted it because this was the Bible That's right The Bible had to be fulfilled he had to tell us there's going to be a true bride he had to tell us that the church was over here and the bride was over here he had to tell us that he's going to send us a word of God to do something not just say well I'm right and you're wrong no that ain't it that's not it it's piercing even to the dividing of sun of Soul and Spirit and join in Marrow your your flesh and there's a discerner the thoughts and intents of the heart so we looked at the soul of man the soul of man today is if you're sitting here today it's the real you it's the part of you that that most people can't that nobody can see except what you display amen you can hide things you can put things over here you can hide this you can hide this but that soul is what's going to stand at the day of judgment if you have to stand at the day of judgment that soul of you is going to stand at the day of judgment now you're going to take your spirit in your flesh with you cuz you're one unit everybody with me but if you got the soul of almighty God how you going to be judged right how you going you're standing your judgment now we have as brother Bob was talking about we have separated oursel the Holy Ghost has separated us and ask us and and and not ask us and probably I don't say demand but he loves for us to live a separated life amen to where when we walk down the road they say and usually the world says what's wrong with that PE that person we want to say what's right about it but they want to say what's wrong with that person what's wrong with that sister oh look look old with her hair long and hey you know what God loves it if God loves it I love it all right so your soul today is either Faith or doubt you're either born again or you're not born again everybody with me all right the spirit realm though has five senses memory reasoning conscious affe and Imagination that's where we have our problem that's right right right even though your soul as we were talking not too long ago you know if you're born again today your soul don't sin abely so the real you doesn't sin but you see how strong that sin was in the garden from the memory Reon and conscious affection imagination and then out into your flesh you see how God had to separate that thing but then he brings it back together and he says the soul that sinth will surely die that's right not this the soul that sinth shall surely die not the spirit the soul God said All Souls are mine he gives them he takes them away he's the only one that can't Satan can't create he can't take them away God's the only one that can do it absolutely praise God we serve a God that's in control yes sir whether we think he's out of we're out of control we praise God we have a God that's totally in control of everything and sure we ask why brother Donnie said and I was preaching the other Wednesday night on on you know questioning God and questioning what's going on and we saw that a prophet question God and got in trouble for doing that but the Providence of God we know one thing for sure he cannot make a mistake any move he makes is the right move so we must accept that yes we must accept that and move on instead of having a pity party sir listen we've had I was looking at the the 40th iversary picture in there on the St in the study and there's six people now there's more than that that's left the church but there's six people that's physically passed away that went to this went been to this church since the 40th anniversary six people passed away moved over in you know they don't live here no more right they live over another dimension but you know what what took them over there was what they heard here and what they took in that's why church is important what you take in is what you going to take over there that's right if you got an animosity to a brother you're not going to take it over there you might go over in another place over here but you're not going to go in that place cuz that's where your soul goes yes everybody with me that's how how hideous sin was when God had to separate that thing he said I'll put enmity I'm going to put a division between I can't even stand to see what y'all did but I'm going to make a provision that's right I'm going to take a lamb I'm going to kill it myself yeah God killed a lamb what do you think who do you think did that in the Bible Well your God don't have hands my God's a human if you don't if you don't mind me saying he's not a clown he's not a spook he's not Casper the Friendly Ghost he's a man and he's way more real than we are and he's way more solid than we are sir and way more intelligent than we are so let's trust in what he's done I listen as brother Ernie vill W always said he said you got to plug yourself into the Eternal if you're born again today you are plugged into that Eternal and you can't be unplugged that's right but you got when you get plugged in you got to do what the current says turn the light on yes sir Ephesians 1 verse4 says according as he has chosen us we're going to read this this afternoon a little bit different according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world so in the mind of God we were chosen of God we were perfected in God that Genesis 126 man never sinned right that's why when it comes to you it's a new birth it burns all that out and you don't have to stand judgment you don't have to stand you don't have to stand at the Judgment bar praise God that scar people to death I heard a guy the other day and he was a denominational guy he said he said well when I get to judgment I hope I he you know XYZ I thought man I leave a denomination that told me I was going to have to go through the tribulation period and go say before the white Throne judgment I'd leave them didn't you you're sting here today you left it because of something must have been false Doctrine Lord there's some good people out there but listen that system is rotten God hates that thing all right we don't hate the people but if you attach yourself to it just like if you attach yourself to it then you're part of it so let's be a part of the Eternal we've attached oursel to the Eternal all right having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ where to himself listen if everything we do if we get Jesus Christ does it in himself yes that's where we're perfect that's where we're without spot that's where we're without wrinkle yes sir not in our own righteousness filthy rags you ever took an old filthy rag I found one other day out in the yard oh it was horrible that's my and your righteousness to God but brother John he took that rag yes and one day he cleaned it up he used the bleach of the Holy Ghost and he cleaned that thing up and now there ain't a spot nowhere praise God for that amen sorry I was going to teach a little bit but I'm preaching something so but look also we got to remember too that as we go through this uh plan of God we have to know that we have to come to adoption because it's required in this age because look having predestinated us yes predetermined pre predestiny determined why could he pre Destiny determined cuz he saw that there'd be a group of people here and he'd have his word to connect to it right all right see we've got to know that see in Luther's day he connected with the just shall live by faith now he didn't connect with one God come on he was a trinitarian but we connect to that that's why the prophet of God had to come take all the Loose Ends and bring them back together so having predestinated us so we're predestinated to what not just to get born again but to be adopted yes to be a son and daughter of God that can stand here one day and as we'll read here maybe this afternoon where brother Ram said you pray for the sick now he said you'll command it then what you'll command what yeah but you know what we got to command this guy first this guy is my worst enemy right right so your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing so but You' got to be born again so you can come into the line of adoption because you can't be adopted without being born again all right and what is adoption we'll talk about this afternoon I'll break it all down how it was in the Old Testament and how it is in Israel now called a bar mitzvah and we'll see what that means because we got to talk about the placing your adoption is your placing yes it's not the place you sit okay physically but it's the place that you are at in the word of God it's the place that you're at in maturity or not we've been going to this church a long time lot of you've been going a long time all your life we've got to come to adoption it's been preached 50 years ago and it's still being preached now we have got to come on speaking terms with God speaking condition with God where he can use us use a powerful Church they may just be one I contend this is it if not we need to go find it I didn't get many amens out of that but when you're born again of the spirit of God you're son of daughter of God we know that right but we were predestinated I see separated it we were predestinated to what to adoption all right God don't want children sure he loved the Pentecostal battling babies ones that spoke in tongues and thought that was the Holy Ghost and they'd have this gift over here and they somebody be brother even brother ran be preaching and somebody jump up and speak in tongues that's totally out of order but he allowed it to happen and he kept telling the now he kep kept telling his home church he said hey quit doing that all right right he put everything in order but it was babies and brother Brown knew it was babies he knew was talking to baby somebody that didn't even know what he was talking about most of the time cuz remember we'll read it where he said it's not to you it's not for you so what is adoption let's go to Peter because Peter talks about it say if these things be in you and abound what these things right be in you and abound in other words you use them I like what brother brother Aaron or somebody's got a a quote said if you haven't used anything in 7 months or something he said you need to throw it away well if you hadn't used these in s months you better start you better start praying cuz this is God In Motion this is God using us to do something all right he's trying to get us to listen to what he's saying bre these being in you and ab bound they make you Peter old rough old rough Peter the old fisherman Peter Peter said this will make you that you shall neither be bearing nor and fruitful in the knowledge of Our Lord why we come to church if we don't want to be fruitful why we have Christian if we don't want to become fruitful I think the Bible says show fruit meet for repentence show fruit listen if you're not showing fruit then your Vine got cut down somewhere cuz if you put it in the ground and you give it the right nourishment and you keep it trimmed come on somebody it will produce fruit just a law of it's just a law of production but he that lack at these things is blind all right you may be born again but you're blind you're still a baby right you know BL babies may be able to see but they're blind what are they blind to they're blind to that that's hot don't touch it they're blind to that they need to sit right here and if they fall off they're going to hurt their head they're blind to that you might be a Christian and function as a Christian but you could be blind as a bat but he that lack these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten sometimes we do we forget that we were purged from these old sins wherefore the rather their Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall now that's a that's just as much a promise that's thus sayith the Lord amen cuz God wrote it in the Bible That's Right everything is thus sayith the Lord in the Bible that's so through Peter he says you shall never fall amen for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you look that entrance is this message of the hour that entrance is what you stepped into because you open the door and let Christ in so there's an entrance ministered unto you abundantly in the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ now that's not a kingdom over there what he say your kingdom is within wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things 136 sermons we're all a little slow we're Southerners but we're okay though you know them look though you know them and be established in present day truth so Matthew 17:5 and we know that in the first part of Matthew when Jesus went to the river and was baptized there was a Dove came down and and there was a voice that said this is my beloved Son in whom I pleased to dwell right didn't say here ye him at that time he had some growth to do cuz the Bible says he grew in Grace and knowledge the Bible said he had to have a mountain experience he had to come to adoption so now this is Matthew 17 he's up on top of the mountain Behold The Voice come out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleas I'm well pleased hear ye him in other words I have identified where I am well listen God through a prophet identified that his bride is him yes amen not a second person the bride is him yes the voice of the bride and the voice of the bridegroom is the same yes if it's not you were out bride cu the bridegroom's voice is always going to be the same it's just the bride's voice has got to be the same as the bridegroom Luke 9:33 says it came to pass as they departed from him Peter S un to Jesus Master it is good for us to be here and let us set up a trinitarian Doctrine let make three Tabernacles one for you one for Moses one for Elijah not knowing look not knowing what he said he got excited he just blurred it out that's Peter you know the same guy that wrote about these a little later when he got the Holy Ghost he didn't have the Holy Ghost here while he thus spake God cut him off while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered the cloud and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son hear him and when the voice was passed Jesus was found alone and they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen brother R did the same thing he went I this is what I believe he went up on a mountain and he was adopted a cloud that was a voice spoke through that cloud said go back to Jefferson bille these seals will be given to you there the seals weren't revealed to him in Tucson they were revealed to him in Jeffersonville all right he said go back and these things will be made known to you to me that's when I believe that brother brownon was adopted and then he said hear ye him because listen then then why not will you say well how can you establish that how many people preached the truth of the seals in 1963 that's what I thought nobody oh Clarence Lin they said oh clar you see that they got that junk on online now where where brother Brown stole it from Clarence Lin Clarence Lin might have been a good man he might have been a holy ghost fi preacher but he wasn't a prophet he wasn't an identified Church age messenger in the Bible right and he just preached the seals and then went on brother R preached the seals and I believe it opened up to us it was for this bride this end time bride sir not the one back there this one cuz he says right here in questions and answers on the seals now this is he's preached first seal second seal third fourth fifth and six seals he's preached six seals he's getting ready to preach the seventh that afternoon or that evening all right so he has questions and answers cuz remember always between a 600 and a 7 there's an interval we'll preach on that maybe a little bit later I know that you don't see it cuz see there was no one adopted during that time brother Ram is standing on a level that no one had stood on since that time of Christ everybody with me I'm identifying where God is Not That William Brandon was God no way he is a sinner just like me and you born in sin shapen in iniquity had to be born again yes right but he was a church age messenger he was identified in the Bible and I don't care what man says if the Bible said that's who it was that's good enough for me all right but he said I know that you don't see it I'm just positive you don't see it remember tell this Vision to no one until the son of man be risen again I didn't read that but Jesus said that going down the mountain he said look hey don't tell this to nobody until the son of man be risen again well he rose the first time 2,000 years ago when's he going to rise again in the end time in a bride The Headstone us as being the collective body brings The Headstone back we'll get into that a little bit later but I'm positive you don't see it you say brother R that's a hard thing to say I know it is but look let me just say this now I suppose this is just tape for oursel well it went all over the world but let me say this that you don't get it and you're not supposed to get it and you're not supposed to get it so he's not frustrated sure he's frustrated in his Humanity but he's not frustrated that it's just going to be words just going to be thrown out somewhere he knows it's the word of God the greatest thing since Jesus was on Earth he's fixing to open those seals all right back in now he's preached six of them he sees that it's the greatest Ministry that he'd ever had the most anointing he'd ever had and they're just sitting there going can I wear panty hose can I wear pajamas to bed and several of the questions two questions was on the seals the rest of them were not one of them was on water baptism and you know what brother rham in his in his in his Humanity he probably was rolling his eyes but in his in his pastoral work as a prophet he answered it just like he answered it 10 years ago 20 years ago he answered it he didn't say like some of us AG go hey you ought to know this by now no he took it and he answered it about water baptism that he preached for years and years and he answered the question what about water baptism and all the different things that's why he saw that they didn't get it but look he says look you're not supposed to get it so don't try to interpret it man tried to do that don't try to put your interpretation to it you only get further away that's what man's done they've got further away from the word of God by not being what in the word for their hour Hallelujah as brother Vernon was talking about the continuity of the word means that that word is moving and it's moving from from dispensation to dispensation this is now the dispensation to get out of here this is a dispensation when The Headstone will speak it will speak through a bride and it will not speak through one person we've had that one person but it'll be a many membered body somebody's going to catch it may not be but three people or four or two but somebody's going to get this take my advice if you believe me now if God has given me favor in your sight you know that them Revelations are things I've been here with you a long time and it's always been right and now to double prove it right it hooks right in with the word so you know it's thus sayth the Lord that's exactly it's proved to you now take my advice as your brother don't put your own interpretation to anything you just go on live a good now he didn't say that weren't Christians he didn't say well bless God you all lost you ain't getting what I'm saying so you're lost no they're Christians they're Christians for a dispensation that the door or the book wasn't open to them don't put your own interpretation to anything you just go on and live a good Christian Life CU you'll only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do so there must be a real thing and they will wind their yourself away from the real thing all right you'll only wind your way again away from the thing and all of you are conscious that know that there's something mysterious happening and it's happening and I know what it is in other words the opening of the seals was the Revelation that had been hid since Jesus left the earth now I'm not saying that it's the grace of God that lets me know what it is it's something that's tremendous and it's gone right now and there's no way in the world for you to see it but so help me with this Bible in my hand I know what it is it was for us amen it was closed to them open to us just like I tell you many times some people man told me one time he said the seventh seal is not open I said okay that's fine to you to you it may not be open because you're confessing that it's not but to me it's open right so the seven seal is not open Le you understand it Hebrews 5:10 called of God and high priest after the order of mezc of whom we have many things to say and Hardy uttered seeing you look see you're dull of hearing I read that because that's what brother R was telling those people you're dull of hearing but this is not for you he so gracious to say look this is not for you in other words it's not going to return void though it's going to accomplish there's going to be a generation how many of us were born in 1963 prior to right amen it was for us and all y'all just born after if not it would have closed the book The Seal would have open they'd have took a Rapture him we'd have never been here but that's not what God saw before the foundation of the world he saw a group of people that would sit here and even though they sit here and they do this and they they try to understand what's going on some of the young ones you're still here yes you're here listening and I believe the spirit speaks to everybody individually at your own level cuz he will not leave you or forsake you so he's going to talk to you in your your terms if you'll listen but remember Paul's going to tell us here in a minute for when the time we ought to be teachers we have need that one teach you again the first principles of the Oracles of God in other words what a baptism no eternal hell all these different things but there is time for that and we need to Circle back sometime remember I told you the Lord told me a couple years ago that he's not going to leave anybody behind that wants to catch up so this is the catching up Time Each past two years was a catch catching up time if you didn't catch up in these last two years then we're heading toward the coming of the Lord so your Gap is a lot close mine too our Gap is a lot closer than it was two years ago all right for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again would be the first principles the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat in other words he's sitting there looking at adults that should be adults that should be eating meat and they're drinking drinking milk that's what brother randam was doing see Paul and brother r if you took their life remember I did that years and years and years ago take uh Moses Jesus Paul and brother brandham and you put their lives together and pretty much they're the same amen all right pretty much I said Moses had an experience with a burning bush Jesus had an experience Paul had an experience on the Damascus Road and brother Bram had an experience with with a voice talking to him up in a tree there's a light hanging over him at his birth I just pray there's a light inside of you that can understand it for everyone that uses milk is unskillful now it doesn't say you're lost like I said before he didn't say those people were lost they were unskillful listen to be adopted you have to be skillful right cuz you can't say something to miss because you then you have so much power in your voice power without character it's satanic that's what we've been preaching on the power is there but get everything together before you speak because what you say for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a babe didn't say he wasn't born he was a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use do we use the word of God we're given to its fullest extent I want to ask you that today I don't and that don't mean we have to be God zombies do you understand what I mean we're human beings right we're human beings but we should spend more time with the Lord than we do with Facebook and this book and that book and nothing listen nothing wrong with it if there's nothing wrong with anything Harley if you use it right because the communication we all communicate through WhatsApp well you let's throw it away no brother no don't throw it away but don't be sitting there back and forth for three or four hours with each other yeah hello somebody yeah I'm not talking to anybody [Music] here [Music] Facebook all those books listen they're here to stay there's nothing you can do about it electronic you listen everybody's going cashless now you ever learned how to use a debit card or a credit card cu the hospital sent us a message the other day that cashless you don't go up there and give them cash no more nope and when you go to a restaurant you pay with cash they look at you crosss side what's that it's cash we use it within little cards like this but look by reason of Youth have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil now what's your senses memory reasoning conscious affection imagination that's your reasoning Factor that's your senses that God works through and Satan Works through both that's the Battle Ground when brother Brian preached the greatest battle ever fought he wasn't talking about that it was locked up here in your brain no it was the it was you the spirit real the incompass is your daily Journey if it wasn't for my memory I'd be a lot better off hello somebody I wasn't conscious of the evil that run through this head of mine and I'm sorry it only happens to me so he said oh don't miss this after that son was adopted see now not before after that son was adopted his name on the checkbook was just as good as his daddies now when you're born again and you start as a newborn babye God doesn't give you a checkbook Blank That's Right power without character I know you can't Banger up to heaven but you could write some pretty big checks that you really shouldn't have wrote but Power with character God hands you the checkbook and doesn't have any reservation with you using it amen you see in my Humanity no your Humanity has been taken away amen you see you just said we were human you're still human but we got to somewhere that got to conquer that memory if we keep thinking about the stuff we used to do come on somebody I thought when we got born again that was thrown in the sea of forgetfulness and God don't remember it no more why keep bringing it back up to it you're wasting his time and yours that's why you got to put it down and say I'm born again this is the day whatever happened back this way if God thought enough of me to birth me into his body then he thought enough of me to clear my Slate from their back Bob ready it brother Bob look poer he didn't just say now you might have stole a little something from Walmart now or or you might you might put a extra gas in the car that you really didn't need to no he said you were wh mongers a feminine bad stuff stuff you get put in jail for come on he said that's for some of you but what but you're washed Sanctified there's a way to get out of this there's a way to get out of this amen and it's the word of God for your day amen they might have not back in Luther's day they couldn't get all the way out that's what the prophet of God kept saying they didn't nobody understood that he said they couldn't get all the way out Luther couldn't get all the way out get out of what get out of that denomination get out of that false teaching he couldn't get all the way out we are all the way out yes sir if you'll accept it there's where God's trying to get his church just say to this mountain be moved and it'll move Authority sons of God the whole creation is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God waiting to a spot to where that the the sickness will be a arise and it will be that way the blind will receive their sight de and done we pray for them now but then you'll command it what you quiet for can y'all say Amen to that don't be don't fear right I'm no longer a what slave to fear I'm a Child of God the blind will receive their sight deaf and dumb we pray for them now but then you'll command it didn't say these signs shall follow them that believe they shall pray for the sick he said they shall cast out devils not I will they will if you say to this mountain not if I say if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart you know listen that I know brother Brandon couldn't have lived this long cuz he'd been like hund and something years old but God took him the time he was supposed to take take him cuz remember God's perfect did somebody say that not too long ago God's perfect his timing is perfect he took that Prophet off the scene because if that Prophet was here today guess what we'd be we'd be looking at the prophet but now we look to Jesus Christ that's who he introduced us to John said look I'm nothing here's the one you need to look at like we were talking about the other day about church ages in the Old Testament John was the last one of the church age he was the hinge pin he he was the the one that had the Old Testament and New Testament John had the spirit of Elijah somebody say Amen so what did he do he turned her heart back and introduced Christ then you start the new church ages the church ages in the New Testament you go all the way through it the very end who shows up Elijah shows up again amen and a little Prophet that turns us back Hallelujah and says that's him she is but then he brings it all back together he says she is him then it's not him over there it's him here but how can the church the Pentecostal church and the Methodist Baptist be adopted until they come to discipline we've got to be disciplined first God could not trust this power with the church it's hard to tell what you would do power without character all right how could a father trust his business to a boy that might simply pollute his whole inheritance he couldn't do it the church has got to come to a place to where it's disciplined God's on that God's on that work right now discipline right because you know listen there's fathers can turn their businesses over to sons and if you look in the world usually it's a disaster seen it many times myself that the son takes over for the father business and it's a disaster why they don't have the same ethics and all that stuff I'm talking about in the world but we bring it here and said how can a father trust his business with a boy that might simply pollute his whole inheritance he couldn't do that the church has got to come to a place so there's got to be like I said predetermined Destiny of a group of people to be adopted that's right can't get away from it but you can plug yourself into it all right God's on that work right now discipline that's why I say and I agree that we have had a pastor that has taught us adoption more than anybody I've ever heard in my life so he's got us in a mindset of that so let's carry on with it all right let's carry on with it yes sir Romans 8: 21 will stop right here because the the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption look in bondage in God there is no bondage now Paul was a prisoner of Christ but he wasn't bound you know even in his even in his incarceration they let him move around he didn't he wasn't bound up they he wrote many of his letters while he was sitting in prison maybe we ought to try that don't get in real prison because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption and the Glorious Liberty of the what the children of God for we know all right we know all right so now stop right there we know we know all these things seals have been open trumpets vs plagues Thunders all the great Mysteries of the Bible Books open for we know then we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together look what Paul said until now he brings it present day but Paul was not predestinated to adoption he preached about it told us that we were but he never came to it that I understand that he came to adoption all right now he had Authority sure he did but to come to the end time adoption cuz we predestinated in the end time to come to adoption to get the people out of the grave that's Paul number irenius remember all that now watch and not only they but ourselves also amen which have the first fruits of the spirit all right we've got the first fruits but you and I have the Harvest Time Coming we've had the latter rain but we got the Harvest rain now that's going to what Harvest a group of people off the face of the Earth everybody with me that's me and you but you got to come to maturity if I would have made corn this year and the deer hun destroyed it it would have come to maturity and I'd have got it out of the garden not before the deer thought before we saw a bunch of them out in the field the other day they took a picture and sent it to us a bunch of them 15 or 16 16 of them out there in the field I said There goes my garden I'll get one or two of them we'll figure out way to get that I'll get some of my garden back it'll be strong meat and not only they but ourselves also Paul said all right not only they but us which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves how many times do you say God get me out of this get me out of this look waiting for the adoption to wit now that word wit begins a word called Witness right so to wit or to see or to witness the Redemption of our body we will see someone come to that Paul did not irenius did not brother brandom did not so who's who's it following another generation another uh Church age another prophet the only next Prophet that comes you're not going to hear him if you hear him you miss the Rapture cuz he's going to Israel you see all that working over there you see that big Soup pot they stirring that big Soup pot up but I'll guarantee you there's two witnesses over there right now I say in the name of the lord they're there don't know where they're at but they're there cuz it's time for us to get out of here when we do they can't be little babies right they got to be mature their self in whatever they're in the Orthodox or wherever they are they may be fighting right now now but guess what they can't die that's right they just don't know that yet but once they do they'll know they've got 1260 days to preach the gospel to the Jews take out 144,000 and2 and take a Rapture but you and I that's not to us that's right like I said before I'll read it maybe I'll read it later on tonight where or this afternoon where the Lord stands up and he says look he said let me see if I can find it we was talk about the law and school Master we talk about this I'll find it this afternoon come on musicians but Jesus stood and he told him he said look he said just like brother brand he said look this is not for you uh this is going to be passed to another group of people who in other words it wasn't for the Jews this is not for the Jewish people that's right this is for Gentiles yes sir the Gentile dispensation started on the day of Pentecost and will end with us leaving this Earth and all the Gentiles before they some Jews included but all Gentiles before are going to go out of here and God's going to come back down and speak to the Jews through two prophets we know that we see that in the Bible so God bless you let's stand our feet and I'll read it this afternoon cuz I know I got in my notes oh here let me read it right here Jesus said unto them this is Matthew 21:42 we'll read this again this afternoon Jesus said unto them did you never read the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner so he became the head of the corner down at the bottom Cornerstone that's not the Cornerstone that's headstone Cornerstone we'll talk about this afternoon same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing yes and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore say I unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you who's he talking to Jews that's right the kingdom of God will be taken from you denomination and give to a
