house will serve the Lord we tried to we've tried to preach the gospel to you for 40 years here in the building and we've tried to go beyond man's Camp CU that's man's Camp is different little groups you know I believe this and I believe this and I'm sit down here and they just camp and they don't go go nowhere you know but we've been trying to move on and moving on in the Lord and we just

we just you know be having to eat together after we get through and all and we this thank God for all of you we appreciate the flowers that sister Gail has put up here and they're wonderful because

service and and all and it you know I really appreciate it cuz it's typical of what we tried to do is preach the gospel amen for 40 years try to get you to see Jesus Christ amen cuz that's the only desire I have money gold whatever that doesn't matter not worth anything let see Jesus Christ am to see him glorified amen so let's just saying Open the Eyes of My Heart brother Keith Reed most of you know him from Jamaica as he comes to bring the word of the Lord unto us we pray that God will bless him and open our hearts and show us the day and the hour We're living because if it's not present tense gospel what good is it we can look backward we can look forward but if we don't look at what God is doing it's not helping us at all amen so let's just sing it and do it Open the Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see do you I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you to see you I am LIF shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love we sing Holy Holy Holy I lift it up high and lift it up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power anding holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen amen praise the Lord you may be seated just for a while certainly we want to thank God for this privilege of being in the house of God and to be gathered together with God's people amen amen to praise and to lift up the name of our God we thank God for our families and the extended family the church and I believe the Church of God has got to be a family unit together amen and for the Church of God to survive and to stay together as one it's got to be be like the way God laid it out in the book of Deuteronomy uh where God he said teach these things diligently diligently to your children amen when you go to your bed at night and when you get up in the morning and so when you teach that together then you stay together as a family you know we can say for these 40 years uh I am certainly privileged to be standing in your midst of sibling and to see a church that has stand together for 40 years it's certainly a blessing and it certainly takes the glory of almighty God Amen you know many times we can say you know a church used to be over there a church used to meet in that building but where are they today and so it takes not just a friendship it takes a call from God and God positionally placing the people together as one under a unity and one thing as a people that we can never forget or we should never forget is that it takes a leader to keep the body of Christ together and um men who are anointed and called of God and elected to stand we'll certainly stand in these days amen because uh you know the said a people don't just leave the church they leave their Pastor right and and you you've got to believe that the Bible says remember them that as to rule over you was spoken to you the word of God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that we say the second part but we forget the first to remember them that as to rule over you which God has put in position tonight I I'd like i' like to speak more to the background of the unity of the church and then tomorrow I'd like to speak on the times that we're living in and to look at the Prophecies of the day that we're living in and what God is pointing us to for this day amen so we we just want to be real easy this this afternoon amen and just to look at some things of the family amen the family of God Amen and then tomorrow we move into another Direction but I certainly would like to greet you all from a church in Lindon Jamaica the spoken word Tabernacle and we say it's a church for the young of heart and so it doesn't mean if you're older you can't be there you just got to be young at heart amen praise God we we certainly love the Lord and I certainly thank God Amen there were years when I said I thought and I honestly thought that God had given me the hardest group of people to pastor and I would have said Lord I mean why did you give me these but I tell you as the years rule by certainly by the grace of God there's a lot of maturity amen and I would say I wouldn't exchange him for nobody amen praise God so we thank God for growth amen praise God and we we we certainly thank God for many who have left us over the years they've come back to the house of God and come back to the truth and um you know we we so got to be careful sometimes when people walk away from us how we treat them because uh you know they might even backslid in God but you they hold the foot until they come and um you know like the the prigal you know the father never was upset with the son because you had gone all these years but we're glad you're back and we're glad that God sent you because listen those who God has called they will come to the feet and they'll always be there there's nothing you can do to stop that and so we we want to have the best attitude to everybody and we want to treat everybody that they're going to make it in they're going to cross this Jordan into the promised land because we don't know who will and we don't know who won't and I'm going to waste my time to hammer those who won't go because I've got a message to preach those who will amen and so in the midst of preaching to those who will cross those who won't cross might just get on the number and cross over so it's not my position to divide amen I just feed the Bride of Jesus Christ with all the respect to realize that it is not my wife it is Christ's bride amen and what a glorious position to be in to be the friend of the bridegroom to be able to speak to the bride Hallelujah the glory of the bridegroom that she might comes into his image and what a day that will be when you're standing in the image of Jesus Christ Hallelujah pure and unadulterated by the word of God so we certainly thank God for amen the church uh spoken word church and we thank God that you have always been here and we've looked at I've looked at Brother Sam and brother way as big brothers in the Lord you know and so and um I thank God for the respect that we share with each other over the years you know they've never said to me brother Keith you ought to preach this and I've never challenged them on anything but I've respect them in all their walk that they are men of God Amen and I certainly appreciate even the fact that they say fit to invite us to come and to share with you all this evening and it's certainly a privilege from our heart to be with you this evening amen may God bless you and may the church in Lula in Lula grow from strength to strength and May the grace of God shines upon you we stand on our feet this evening as we turn to the word of God we're going to read from the book of Deuteronomy this evening start with Deuteronomy chapter 1 I'm going to start by reading Deuteronomy 1 and verse 6 but as you find it may we just bow our heads as we talk to the author of the word this evening our gracious God and our father Lord we we privilege oh God to be standing in your presence this evening Lord God not because we are anything before you God Lord God before the foundation of the world you are for ordained even this day that Lord God your sons and your daughters should come together and to stand oh God to declare your word and to let your doings be known to all the people Heavenly Father we pray God you take lips of clay that would hutter Eternal words of promise and Lord God May the ears that hear your word Lord God may they recept oh God to the words of almighty God may we realize that beyond the faces that we've seen this evening that Lord God Dy is among us today Lord Lord God may your word be constantly be uphold and Lord God may we give reverence always to your word realizing oh God that it's this word that is spacking us out of here into the glories that we go to so bless us God as you teach us the precepts of your ways and we thank you God for this glorious occasion in the Milestone that your people have got to Lord God we know we can say that we've come this far by faith leaning on the Lord and Lord God we pray that you would lead us on bless your word oh God this week as we speak oh God and bless our fellowship together and Lord God May the heart of the humble rejoice in the presence of God and we pray believing in Jesus name amen amen and amen in Deuteronomy 1 and verse 6 the Lord Our God spake unto us in herab saying you have dwelt long enough in this mountain turn ye and take your journey and go to the Mount of the amorites and unto the places nigh there unto the plains in the hills and in the veil and in the salt and by the seaside in the land of Canaan canites and onto Lebanon onto the Great River the river ephes behold I've have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them then we turn over to Deuteronomy chapter 6 and this beautiful verse that I love verse 6 it says and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently to thy children and shall talk of them when thou sest in thy house and when thou west by the way and when thou liest down and when thou rise up and thou shal bind them for a sign upon thy hands and they shall be a fortlet before thine eyes may the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated the book of deanime we find that God was going to do a new thing among his children right having taken them this 40 years through this Wilderness a long period of time and what an experience they had the things that they' seen but God now come to this position and I find that every time that God is going to do a new thing among his people the first thing that he does he remind them where he brought them from and the things that they had been through because God brought them to a bench Mark and then God tell them what he's going to do right and so here it is that Moses had brought them thus far 40 years oh yeah this long journey right amen and the family was together and they could have had Memorials of those that they walk out of Egypt with that they held hands and might be sing the songs of Zion yeah and had seen the travail of God's people and the things that they come upon the the Red Sea and the crying of the children they had a me heard how when they cried to God and and Moses mean went before the Lord and cried and God answered them amen and there was they could have uh remember amen the Red Sea and the Quil coming they could remember the bitter water and me turning sweet and and all this that God did to them but there was a purpose that God by Moses had commanded him to tell the children of Israel how you are to dwell yeah and in unity and as a communion of people God dwelt with them as a family and keep them together right right you know we focus of all God now telling them there in Deuteronomy 6 and thou shallal teach them diligently unto thy children because God believes that there is to be a continuation of what is started it should never be that yes we did that yesterday all the things and the glories that we had yesterday in the message but where is it today on we we no longer do it it's pass it's it's something of yester year right right yet Brethren God has dealt with us in this way where he's moving his children from Glory onto glory amen we're not at the same position we're not at the same place there's experiences that we've got but every time we get there God is doing something for us exactly kept them together as a unit the best way I can describe it as like the unity of a family teach it diligently to your children Glory you know brethren we find that where there is a strong family unit there's going to be a church that is together and let the family unit be dispersed and where is the church right amen the family is the germ of civilization and we are witnessing ing the debt of the family because mean of the changing of the culture of the people let us see is upon us that's right brother brandham what a time he was living in when he said it is not children delinquency but it is parents delinquency because the the parents have change the standard the morals are not the sameen theyve moved away from the arms and so it is upon their children amen yeah the family therefore is under major assault right amen so much so amen that the precept of yesterday it's hard to teach to your children but I bring you this this evening that God when he speak to Abraham and when God speak of him God said I know the man Abraham I know that he will lead his children after him that's what God wants amen and so that's how the Church of God am mean ought to stand am mean I take words from the message trying to do God's service he said this was Moses speaking to Israel after he had been Vindicated by God by a pillar of fire and know he was proven to be God's servant to lead them out and before they went into the land before they entered Moses said now the word that I SP have spoken unto you I call Heaven and Earth to witness against you if you had one thing to it or take one thing from it right Hallelujah you'll not stay in the land where the Lord your God give you what a command Glory if you had anything to it if you take anything from it in other words he was simply saying to them keep the word pure keep it unadulterated don't mix it with anything exactly yes sir Hallelujah you are the witness he said so say I in the name of the Lord Jesus don't you had one thing no brother brand him speaking to the church in just he said sa say I in the name of Jesus don't have what something to it right hallelujah amen can we say amen and we have heard that word we have heed that word don't take or put your own ideas in it amen hallelujah hallelujah it is still the same thanks be to God you just say what is said on those States you know Brethren we've gotten so intellectual where what is said on those States seem oldfashioned to many but we can say it's a power of God unto salvation it is a revealed word of God that can take us out of here and we're looking for anything else hallelujah we're satisfied he said you just do exactly what the Lord God has commanded you to do right don't had to it amen you notice the parallel of brother Bam's Ministry and Moses ministry that's right exactly is that Moses was simply saying to them he said listen he me God take you to record to the word of God that you have received that you should not add to it or you should not take from it and the things that was before them was the land of promise amen am yes we're going to possess this land but we're not going to the land the way we feel the way we like we're not going to possess the land because we're in the message we're not going to possess the land because we're in Lula we're going to possess the land because we've got the charge from God and we keeping forth on the word of God somebody said I know whom I've believed in and I'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which are committed unto him against day hallelujah hallelujah the family of God has got to be together right you know as we teach our children at home so the church ought to be in everything right I give you scriptures just for your remembrance not as though you don't know them Ephesians 6 and verse1 children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right right am a principle Exodus 2012 honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee amen it was for the family unit and I tell you Brethren the blood is for the family hallelujah amen listen Masterpiece the message Masterpiece said notice the Great Masterpiece of the family the husband and wife cannot be truly a family unless they are one amen amen they have to be if they're not they're not a good family wife pulling one way and the husband pulling another way how many times you see that right that will make an awful family but in the agreement with love one another or with love one to the other that's a family and now amen that was God's Masterpiece and all the true family here portray that right and second the second second Adam second Eve ready now to return back to the home amen and the whole picture as been Redemption right from where it was bringing it back just exactly bringing it back together again it's got to be a unit together Brethren there's something about the church that makes a church United together as one there's got to be a spirit of care right I remember some years ago when I was just a young believer and I would be back home and you know I went to I'm I'm originally Baptist and you know I would have gone back to the people who have known when I was a child and you have been to the church and you know becoming a young Christian and you know I started preaching real early and you know the people knew me very well and you know they gave me the opportunity to preach and you know I used to go among them and preach and you know I remember they they started like a good good Revival in our area and different ones you know would have come out to the church and you know people from every walks of life were just coming to the church and you know the there was The Good The Bad and The indifferent and everybody was just coming you know I remember personally I remember when I was a childen there was this woman that was in our community and I was really afraid of her because when she walked on the street the words that come from her mouth I tell you I was literally afraid afraid of her and brother you know I this young Christian and I see her com into church and you know the next thing this was she came and she young me and she give me a big kiss and you know I stood there at the front and I see people coming and somebody said hey look who's coming where they think they're going they're going to the Church of God you know Brethren one thing we've got to realize the church right is not ours amen Lula don't belong to you it belongs to God Amen and Bren I tell you the indifferent is going to come but what are you going to do about it on it is not your call it's God's call hello somebody that the call of God for this assemble is greater than your life hello it is an experience that God is doing and you cannot do anything about it whether you like it or not but you're coming into the this experience that God is calling you to amen amen in this 40 years where have we gone right you know Brethren I've looked at the transition of the house of God and you know years ago when I first came here you know there was all there was was might be just a little tape ministry that's all there was but I remember sitting with in cracker bell with Brother Sam one time we were on our way out and you know I was saying you you just I I just started going on the internet on the worldwide web yeah and you know I said to him I said Brother Sam I want you to remember one thing when you speak to your church sometimes I listen and you're speaking of the Affairs of what is happening in Lula but you've got to realize that there's a worldwide audience that is listening to you right and so we we we're in the times of transition where now we're seeing what God had really called us for and sometimes we've got to be careful that we don't he narrow our vision to these people who are sitting right here before us and the problems that brother dick have and the the problems that brother Wade have and the problem you see what I'm saying because Breen the call of God is beyond the house am right amen but yet many will not be able to make that transition because they trapped in a spasm of of the place that they are and they're not going any further that's right brother but Brethren when I see a church for 40 years when you started 1971 amen the aspiration that you've got today was not what you had back then what you had was you've heard the voice of a prophet and you believe that word and and there was something tugging on you to tell you that there's something greater GL than just we here and what we've got and we've got to progress with it I say to you challenge that with the vision that you've got today Amen brother the church is no longer just the four walls here right right and those that hear you but I challenge you this day but if from the word of God you start to hear then listen you don't just affect these that are listening to you brother then there's a challenge beyond what you understand right that is right there before you the way you walk is not just to you here right amen but there is a greater Horizon that is there on the outside that is listening to you amen exactly and so if the song leader takes the position light if the deacons take their position light part of the family then they don't understand that they're affecting the moving of the body of Jesus Christ you know as a pastor what gets me per terb sometimes is to see a song leader comes to church and he sit there at the front somewhere and start to flip through his song book try to find a song to sing and for the word to be delivered to the people I couldn't sleep last night yeah because there was something on my mind right amen and I saw the Lord and you get up and you look at the page and you go go back in the scripture you look back at your notes right and you said well that is important but you know to come and to sing the songs that's not important because we're just going to sing four songs and and we're going to take an offering and we're going to do this and then Brother Sam is going to come who is supposed to be prepared because if he ain't going if he's not prepared then we're going to say something about it yeah but then also the lady you're a part of the family and what was your experience yesterday what was your experience throughout the night did you think about it or is it just something that is going to happen tomorrow I'm going to be in church I'm going to he's going to find something to say to steal my spirit but whether I do or not I'm going to be in my position are you with me Bren we all now has reached a stage where we got to put our sh ERS to the whe we reach a position where the things of yesterday have got to go out because we're coming into the land of possession and youve got to step up to the plate they says step out on the plank amen and move on with the glory of God a family has got to be together glory amen amen hallelujah in the message unbelief and Fa and the faith and Faith mix Isaiah was the son of Ahab had been brought up in the kind of a home that was a lukewarm home it wasn't allog together Christian his mother was a Eden and his father had married out of Fellowship Mar woman that was not a Believer yeah and that always make a bad home for any kid to be raised in oh yeah that when unbelief and Fai ties tries to mix together and now if the father would have been a real strong man in his fate and the child might have been had a a better opportunity but he didn't he didn't have it he know know that there was God he know that there was a Jehovah amen and and that his mother's God and so forth was all confused then after the death of his father this boy in his condition kind of a mixup one way and another and if that ain't a picture of the lands today right one in the family is dis away and another and one another and and and one him me going this way and the other going that way no wonder we are producing so much juvenile delinquency right and all other kind of stuff under the name of Christianity and Breen when we speak of the children we speak of the body of Jesus Christ amen if the ministers if those who carry the word of God don't live the experience then what do you expect the people of God to be are you there with me right but yet every person need to realize that I've got a responsibility to the body of Jesus Christ you know I I tell them I say you've got a responsibility to those who are sick that you ought to live that God would hear your prayer amen for adventure they can't be healed right amen are you with me amen but the bre said it's because there is no Unity there is no real called out and a stand for God you Brethren it's easy even for a church to get lukewarm in their experience oh you've heard it and you've heard it and you've heard it and you've been to church and oh on Sunday morning and Sunday evening and Wednesday or whatever amen it becomes just a ritual to you and the people and being a part of your social group that you go because you got to meet so and so but the call and the conviction of the Holy Spirit you have lost it somewhere oh Brethren people of God I would to God we would have prayed so Lord let God this experience me because I want to socialize but because there's a burning Des to know your will and every person is responsible part of the family right Hallelujah are you there with me Amen in the message recent Church ages said hearing is now set forth to the love of God he desire and love a family of his own a family of Sons Sons like himself that's what we got to be Sons like him right right thank you Lord there before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor and Brethren be not perturbed because that which you desire from God Amen God will make you right right hallelujah amen amen the choose will be his on choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be train to conform to His Image in their walk your walk is important yes ma he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chasen with with with nails car hands sometimes uh Hallelujah this spot makes the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly the way he desires it Brethren can you think of yourself this evening as a handmade of God as a work of God under construction that God is doing with me what God really wants amen today we're taken up with so much of ourselves Hallelujah but the prophet says but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not right there cannot be he loves you this evening but Breen he loves you with unconditional love are you there with me but oh what a responsibility with God as believer us oh people of God to walk in the light of God Amen that's right I tell you sometimes we see the church so powerless yeah come on SO powerless amen you know people come and it seem like they've lost their experience they've lost their testimony with God yeah you know you have walked and you you you've walked am me according to a pattern the Bible says but they've got a form of godliness you know they come to church and they would never show and their tags and their offering and they're giving to God but Brethren the personal experience with God is never there come on oh we serve God when we come together amen as a family the family of God but when I'm drawn aside there is really no experience oh BR I tell you the test of your Christian walk is not when the church is together on but Brethren every man every woman woman every child you've got to have that thing with God where it's me and God Alone Oh there's a song us to sing they are times I like to be all alone with Christ my Lord I can tell him of my troubles all alone hallelujah hallelujah Brethren don't get it wrong this evening that inward Birth has going to drive you to something yeah that what Birth has to create an experience right that there is a fire burning for God come on Amen Hallelujah that don't fool yourself if it's not there mightbe you have left him somewhere yeah are you there with me or we some sometimes feel that all the fire the burning desires it's just for the preachers it's for those who carry the word and you know we we just going to flowery bed of ease oh we're in the church yeah and I've got great respect for my pastor and as long as he walks with God and and hear from God then I'm all right bless him bless hello so that's as far as I go I want to make sure that some walk with God because as long as you stand there you walk with God that everything's all right amen hallelujah glory to God I went to God it was that way amen I would to God it was that way but you know we've all got different experience as Christians you you know I tell you my experience might not be your experience and my experience don't diminish your experience with God that's right you know Brethren but I tell you what I just got times oh I'm just overwhelmed with his presence and the power of almighty God Amen I seen things in the world that I preach it and I I close my book and I go fold up in a corner I don't know God if they believe it but Lord that's what I see right right amen right exactly and I it's just the anointing might be have a minister I mean I want to see the people walk with God I want to see I want to see happy faces I want to hear great test I want to know that the families together in love but it's not always that way brother brandham said in lifting him out of History he said real love does not exist anymore yeah when he looks at the people amen he said but today I don't mean to be critical but when she gets a little whole she just he me swaps for her for a new model he's talking about a man putting away his wife it seems to be that way like swapping cars or something oh my it seems like it's that real family love don't exist much more just something has happened home life is running out we don't have the whole American home like we used to have it long years ago you know Brethren you know I I usually hear the whole folks talk about oh you know years ago what we used to do and years ago the experience that we used to have I challenge them on this one thing if the experience that they had back then and brought them closer to God than what is here today there's something wrong with our Direction exactly amen are you there with me right I don't care if they used to pray all night I don't care what they see if this experience today doesn't bring us closer to God there's something wrong with us today because we're not getting in the rear view mirror we're going forward amen hallelujah amen so I don't believe in bashing the young and I ain't going to bash the whole but I believe as we progress with God we're going closer into the image of God Amen that's what I believe amen Dr about the neglect of love he said the world's looking for something today when your little wife told you she'd be your sweetheart wife she was looking for somebody to love her and when you promise your husband he was looking for somebody when he comes in tired and wey from working all day some little wife to put her arms around him and and kind of brushes hair back and tell him how much he loves him that's what CA separation in families you know the closeness is gone that's right Brethren I challenge you on this when you don't call each other anymore just to see how you're doing yeah and the only time you hear about somebody or see them is when they're in church something is happening oh my are you with me amen something is happening right you said that's what caus a separation in families it's the neglect of love right that's what caus a separation in churches yeah neglect of Love we've got to have Lov one for the other in St John 8 by this shall all men know that you are my disciples because you have love one for the other a church is a reflection of its Pastor right and Brethren that is just the truth if he's a hard man the people is hard if he's a never forgiving man the church will be the same way because Brethren We've Got to Believe that he's feeding and the people are eating from what he's giving right right you know we used to have meetings back home and all the churches get together and you know you could see a bunch of people and you didn't know which one of the churches they come from cuz naturally sometimes I really don't know but you just watch them a little bit the way they act yeah I said ah I know where they're from I know where they're from because they're a reflection of what they're feeding from you believe that and you know they they used to say this about us in Lindon they said when you go to lindstad you feel loved you know Brethren that's the way I want it to be amen amen there's a lot of fighting there's a lot of things going on but when you come to our house you've got to feel love right amen you you know I'm the kind of person it's not hard for me to love anybody it's something that was passed on in my jeans you know I remember when I was a child we were very very poor and you know I remember I mean people used to give my mom's little little gifts and we didn't have anywhere to put it so she gave it to the neighbors and I used to walk by The Neighbor House and look in their little glass case and I see Mama's gift there yeah yeah but she gave everything away but the church there must be love amen you know people says well sometimes they said well you know I was sick and nobody visited me you know I tell you what if you're in a love affair when you're not there people are going to seek you out there's sometimes you find in the church people has got that kind of attitude when they not there you're a little bit more relaxed and that's the truth blessing the next thing's going to happen to you you're going to be sick and nobody's going to call you oh Lord nobody's going to seek you it's what you put in it's what you get out amen somebody you know you got something against that one you got something against that one you got something hello it's the body of Jesus Christ you know we look around and we see problems in every corner hey but you know what but God chose them right Hallelujah something's got to be around somewhere but I'm certain of one thing it's not with God Bren never let there be strain in the house of God Amen you know we've got a way that if there's something that's happened in the church you know the way we do is that everybody in their little corner conference talk about it yeah yeah when when the cor conference me we all talk about it but but to confront the problem we don't do that right maybe we don't want it to be settled yeah we we we want something to talk about you know if you meet together if you call somebody there's got to be a Hot Topic yeah M you know brother sisters so and so oh my I don't know how they do hello somebody you know Brethren if there's a family youit I used to hear them say I don't know if it's that way back home but you know they used to say when when couples has got a problem with each other they didn't put their heads at the same side of the bed but one put one hair and one put the other one there so we we use a term they sleep head and tail yeah because they they got a problem right and the other night I said to Francine I said Francine you see like we we never have a problem because we we've never sleep head and tail because uh you know sometimes we sleep this way and sometimes we see but we we're always on this inside so it seems like we must got some kind of unity yeah you know we ain't fighting you know there's something about it really you know bref let there be no divisions among [Music] you hello and and brother dick the way you both live together in unity if you live together in unity with each other when you come to church you can live with your brethren hello somebody but if if everything that that she does you find fault with it when you come to the house of God you're going to be the same way oh Lord that's good this people's got problem with with everything their pastor does you know theyve got a problem with his tie they've got a problem with his shirt yeah they've got a problem the way he walks hello somebody they've got a problem the way he deals with a situation because they know better how to deal with it hello but Bren I tell you one thing Moses was hearing from God and so when he brought the precept to the people it wasn't Moses it was God speaking brother Bram said when Moses had the word of God to tell him he was more than Moses he was God exactly right amen I ask a question when will we have so much respect for the word of God that we believe when when we prayed for our Minister earnestly and when he stand there to deliver the word of God to us it's God speaking the word of God coming for to you that you can personalize that word to your life Breen listen brother BR said pray for your pastor because he's ordained of God to see you true hello somebody that's what he said do you believe that Brethren if I certainly believe that and I've got a God send Pastor I'm going to hold him up with my pray I'm going to support him with everything that I've got I'm going to make sure that he's comfortable that he is love hello that the grace of God surrounds him amen I tell you as people of God sometimes you've got to even guard your minister hello somebody fire DS of the enemy doesn't come their way to upset them that's right but sometimes you think that you're doing good when you know brother Dale last week I heard brother so and so say this about you and I didn't believe that that's the way he thinks about you you know brother Dale had a good H heart against that brother but when you tell him that it hurt his feelings and he's just human being like everybody else and you know you said no what is the problem well you know because brother so and so say this about him no that's not the problem because you told him hello it's not because the brother felt that way and voice it it's because you told him right and when he heard it it hurt his feelings and when he go to prepare the word of God for that day it was all over him and he couldn't concentrate and he couldn't pray because of what you said oh my amen You' got to guard the the man of God with your life amen that sometimes you take the d That's why God plac deacons in the church hello I know sometimes we got some that sit at the back and sleep oh my hello yeah and you know they see anything anytime at all they're just there but that's why God plac them there and me to watch over the body of Christ to God the body of Christ me that they have Unity among the Brethren right people said why is it that when I talk to them they don't hear because the spirit that you speak to them with right you know the Bible speaks about being Lord over can we speak like a family the Bible speaks about being Lord over God's Heritage you know I challenge them them people back home I said I challenge you all I've never in all the years you know me I've never spoken down to anybody come on I never do it no sir and if you want to respect me that's your business but I tell you one thing I'm going to show you respect hello sometimes we feel like well you got to respect me well I don't know if you've got to respect me but I know one thing that I got to respect the brother Christ and that's where you're sitting are you there with me we're waiting on somebody else to do their part no you do your part right right exactly and if it's going to be a family if it's going to be a family you know I I made judgment sometimes with with my children and you you know I got two girls and and the wife so I I tell them I said I've got three girls and so they they said sometimes oh you know I thought you had three daughters no I said I got three girls two of my daughters and the other is my wife but you know sometimes you made a judgment and something and you you say something about something and they'll get around to you and after there's one thing about [Music] girls ah see I ain't got no son I don't know how it is there something about girls and so they they come around and I realize I was wrong well I'll tell you one thing it's an honorable thing for a man if he's wrong to admit that he's wrong and say sorry am and I tell you so much so a minister in the house of God it allows the people to respect you amen amen because the Bible says a brother that is offended is harder to win than a great City you know I wonder sometimes why is it that some church there's always division there's always a fighting there's always trouble but you know Brethren sometimes it's the way you deal with situations sometimes we've got some spirits that escalate oh yeah confusion right if there's a confusion well I want you to say it again I want you to say it again I want to bring you before your face and I want you to say I want yeah you know we can fight over Doctrine but I tell you what I've never find a man that is converted because we were fighting over a doctr right I never find anybody we were arguing about it and we get real loud and and I want him to Christ because I got louder than he I've never found it you know what you find is vation of spirit so in the house of God you've got to temper situations with love that as a pastor sometimes they said you know I see so and so going on and BR he didn't say anything about it but listen it's not that I didn't see it but sometimes you got to watch the time and the season to deal with the situation because sometimes there's some things in the church and and everybody wants you to say something about it now but there's something you learn when the wound is fresh if you put salt on it it hurts real bad hello somebody but if you allow it to go a little bit then in love you can curve the situation trying to do God a service without it being his will brother B said don't never start any start or or try an organization don't try to build upon anything else stay but stay humble before the Lord your God Amen humble right walk in humility before God Micah 6 and verse 8 I show thee oh man what is good and what the lord requires of thee but to do justly to love mercy and to walk humble with your God right he said for it looks like the gates may open unto the promised land soon he said then let us go in with the true singing and rejoicing when the bride and groom takes its place at the throne brother brandham giving a word to the church he said live humble right are you there with me Amen in other words as Believers don't live above your means and you say to the people don't try to live to live like somebody else said live humble live loving love one another don't never get nothing among you if you see something coming up in your heart against somebody get it out of there right then he said then Satan will do his best to get among you see right don't you let that happen listen Brethren he will get among you I tell you he will get in the midst of the Brotherhood right hello somebody you know I've got to be sensitive even to the ministers as I feel led to ask somebody to preach and a certain a certain service I I've got to be real sensitive because Spirits can be created oh yeah among the Brotherhood so you've got to be careful what you're doing I tell you amen yes sir he said and Satan will do his best to get among you don't you let that happen he said some slick tongue fellow might come along and try to take your away from it he said you think they could talk Moses out of the presence of God where it stood there and seen it no sir no we don't take it take from it or add to it just keep it that way Lord the Lord said we don't want no denomination we don't want no organization we don't want no malice we don't want no Strife we want God amen amen and you know Brethren when you start to get clish with each other that's when the spirit of organization seem like it's coming creeping into the church you know when we've got our favorite little click in the church that we keep together and the rest of them we we might not care you know what happened because we've got our little group oh yeah we've got to watch that Spirit that's right that's right are you there with me because Brethren the least among you is a part of the body of Christ amen are you there with me and have the same need we must try the same feeling one for another amen you know I love you brother I love you sister because you're a part of the body of Jesus Christ right amen we want God and is a word hallelujah Glory we want God and he is the word let the word of God dwell with you rich all we say tonight for we have come this far right by faith right amen by faith let me see the answer of those who can say I I've been here from the start yeah from 1971 I I was around at that time oh it's it's a new gen it's a new generation exctly but you know there was something about when the children of Israel reached Jordan it was a generation that was born in the wilderness right those were the ones that cross over into the promise many of the old fathers the fighters that were there from yester year the experience that they had never brought them to that position but by the grace of God tonight here we are and here we stand by faith believing in God I asked the question how we stronger today right how are we were yesterday oh Brethren there were many things you had to fight to as a church there many were here that they're no longer here yeah there many who have gone called in their experience and to them there was no more need to be a part of the body of Christ but we have come this far by faith and Brethren it's not because you are stronger we say that anything that we have achieved it's by the grace of God it's by the grace of God that has kept me because I'm no better than them who have gone on I'm no better than them that I'm no longer here but by the grace of God let us say this evening that God must see something God must have invested something in me to keep me all these things Hallelujah that's right and you know I say this they don't understand me but I I I have this kind of belief if you're in a church and you're not comfortable with that church might be your are to go you know every time back home where you know brother might says well you they feel like they need to be at that church before they go I called the minister I said well you know brother so and so say he feels like you're his pastor and uh there there's nothing between me and him but you know if he feels that way I believe might be you're better able to lead him and there's nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong with that right and you know I send them in the name of the Lord but you know the problem I have is that after a few years when they come back yes and they be bitter with the brother the brother don't speak to me I said brother I I ain't doing do nothing I mean I send the brother off in peace if he comes back not speaking to you that's not my fault right exactly you know brethren we we've got to realize that there's going to be people who no longer worship where you worship but they your brothers and I find this many of times it's not so much the ministers that have anything against each other right but it's the people who want to move from Pastor to Pastor yeah you know they they're in this church and and they're there for a while and and they quit praying they quit having a relationship with God and you know what they do they blame the church they said well I'm not being fed yeah well I being I been fed I'm going to go and so you know go they go with that bad taste and they go and they tell brother so so you know brother so so I was there and I ain't being fed and so you know I heard you and I believe you're really feeding the people and and I'm I'm willing to stay with you in the next two years they gone again were they lying when they come or when they go what was a problem exactly and so the Ministries God to have more wisdom than that that people are going to run to and fr don't let that affect you hello somebody and I tell them and and if you go and if you come again I'm still here by God's grace to receive you amen because you can't send them off and you can't there's nothing you can do but preach the word of God to them but Brethren if you stay with the word of God you can't do any different people say well are they preaching the message and every time they ask that they're they're really saying are they preaching what I'm preaching yeah rightly are are they preaching the message you see they want you to preach exactly what they're preaching right but brother if if you didn't tell me then how should I preach it yeah because I can only preach what God give me are you with me and so listen you can't be like anybody else and you can't be like another church and you know you look over Yonder you said oh but that church they they ain't got no problem I heard brother perig green said one time on T said the only church that ain't got no problem is the one that you don't know them well enough to know the problems that they've got exactly right but I'm sensible enough to know that people are the same wherever you go exactly I tell you you've got a little lighter complexion but I know you give the same problems like them back in Jamaica exactly I know you drive better cars but you've got the same problem you you don't walk to church but you got the same problems and you give the same problems are you there with me and I know if if sadale failed to Pastor you I would fail too somebody said oh brother kid we're going to pack up and come to Jamaica I said no don't come because you wouldn't be able to deal with it I challenge you you couldn't deal with it but it just seems better on the other side oh yeah and so wherever God place you is the place that you ought to be hello somebody and you ought to be sensible enough to know that where God places where God wants you sometimes it look better on the other side but you just go there for a while hello and sometimes when you see you would to God you go back but people are so ashamed they won't come back and say well you know I was wrong and I shouldn't leave in the first place amen but we've come this far back it's by faith believing in God and let me tell you if God has molded you together as a family stay that way stay that way amen you know sometimes we said oh but but that church it's got a Revival you you know I talk to people sometimes and they're part of large churches and you know we we meet places and he said oh which church you go to and I go to which church you go to and they've never met each other yeah and they go to the same church hello and you know you can't speak to your pastor because he's got such a flock that you've got to send an appointment to see him it used to be that when I get to study in the office back home you know people stringing from the door and they want to see me so the deacons used to stay at the door and to keep them out so that they don't come to me I said listen this one thing I said any body want to speak to me I want to speak to them amen I don't want nobody to stop nobody from speak to me because listen I'm a servant to the people and anytime we believe we're more than servant to the people we are walking out of the will of God [Applause] Amen you might got a need it might be the dead of night but if that's a time that you've got the need I mean if I'm going to be a Shepherd I want to know what the need is amen are you there with me right and Brethren the final thing I I say to a church Paul said to Timothy Timothy keep those things that is committed to thy trust Brethren the thing that I've seen affect churches all the time is when within the ministry there is no trust to the people yeah and if a family sit and say something about the the Deep areas of their lives that the only person that really want to tell is God I only sit and listen as a servant of God Amen and I tell people I've got no authority to say what their problems were than to tell it to God Amen cuz Brethren one of the worst thing that you can find in the house of God is if the dark things or the Deep things that you speak about you hear it all over the church brethren we are to keep the confidence of one another as Brethren right because it shows that you've got the spirit of God and the love of God is with you right and I use this Mark as I close to explain this to you you see when a family and within the nucleus of a family there is a problem and that problem affects the pro the family in such a way that it affects their esteem they will never talk about it they will never talk about it and Brethren that's how it ought to be with the house of God you know it doesn't matter what happens at Lula yeah the church next door right should never know about it yeah right hello amen because God call us as a unit and a family together and that is why together as a church we try to deal with the things that are here in Lula together and we pray for one another and we cry to God for one another and we cry before God to one another until that thing leave the people right but Brethren we've got no need we've got no authority to take it out of Lula because God is committing us to the trust that we have one and that shows the love that we've got one for another amen and you know I have this confidence when people steps into the office to speak to me I say to them I said and what I want you to do is to tell me the truth the truth because I can only judge before God right if you tell me the truth and all of the truth and if you lie to me you lie before God and you'll never be delivered right but I tell him one thing I said no listen but when you speak to me I want you to say nothing to nobody yeah right because one thing I'll do I'll never mention it right and you want not to mention it we're going to take this thing to God and we're going to put it under the blood exactly and Brethren as Believers we have confidence one with the other because we keep the trust of the people of God and you know I find out of that experience when something happen and somebody comes to me to talk about something that has sticken place they have no problem in speaking the truth because one thing they know by experience right they will never hear it otherwise amen because we are a people together the family of Goden let me tell you there's more forces on the outside that's right that would want to break the church apart oh yes that there's forces that would keep the church together so what do we do we stuck together as a unit amen amen as an organism amen that is stuck together that cannot be removed one for the other that we pray for each other's children that we protect take each other's children that we pray for the families that we counsel with the mothers and the fathers and we speak the things that are needful for the body of Christ that the Church of God be solid with the word of God right this is not preaching this is speaking to the house of [Applause] God let us bow our hands Lord Jesus 40 years is a long time because Lord God Abram walked 25 years brother brandham said it was a long journey but Lord God you have kept a people together Lord you have kept them for a purpose Lord if we should sit back and have a memorial of the things that has passed the things that they had gone through Lord might be many things would have bring tears to the eyes but Lord God there were times when there was dark valleys and and mountains that seems uncrossable and and Lord God tunnels that was too dark to cross but here we are on the other side still leading on God Lord we thank you for your word and the leadership ship of eternal life that has kept our lives Lord God we pray even tonight that Lord God the church would move on from here because Lord God after 40 years all that you brought them to was was the other side of Jordan Lord they were to walk off in the promise Lord could it be that Lord God the experiences and the word and and the prophecies and the promise the Lord God that we have speak of Lord this is a time that that we will see them come to fation we can go and possess the land that you have given to us Lord God May every soul every heart be available to you this evening God Lord God May there be a time of surrendering and rededication of our Spirits oh God to you Lord God our lives consecrated for the service of almighty God Lord God may we come to that place like we have never done it before Lord God tonight this evening Lord God representing ourselves our bodies Paul said as Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God which is our reasonable service Lord God May every man irrespectful of his position tonight present himself in the hands of God and Lord God May the the families leave from your God and and may they go to their homes and and talk about it the things that God has done done hallelujah and the mighty works of God and the word that God has brought us through Lord God may they make a pledge not to their Pastor or to the Lula church but Lord God to you tonight that Lord God you have brought me thus far and Lord God I'm putting my life into your hands to bring me on Lord God may we have a time of rededication a time of surrendering oh God lord we know that there must have been times when Lord God there were wrongs that were done there were things that were said that had brought pain Lord God we pray tonight that the wounds and the bones that has been broken Lord God may they Rejoice Lord God may we have a time in our heart when we look at ourselves of the things that we had gone through but Lord God may we focus on you oh God who can

like that it's been God to hold us together amen Satan's tried a lot of times to do different things but God's helped to hold thing together so we give him all the honor and Glory we got let's try 249 in the r 249 anybody have a need because that's what we've always believed in believe in healing yes sir no Divine Healing no Resurrection all right so let's stormy I stand for we fought B for 40 years round time to move over Pro oh who will come and I am for the pro over all those in [Music] thisal name for God eternal rain and find way I am B for that PR I am B for the oh who will come and go with me I am B for shall I reach them and places be forever when shall I see my father in his I am B for found for pro man and one thought in mine when they come down going ac they got tired of circling around and around I'm tired of circling around let's move on let's step over the lane walk on into a chain come and grow with me I am see I believe that for the bride I believe it for all of us it's time to move on Jesus he the only one who cares and understand standing somewhere in the shadows you will find the believe it standing somewhere in the shadow to my Jesus he's the only one who cares and understand anding somewhere in the shadows you will find it how will you know you know him by the you believe it do we appreciate God and what he's done for us as the brother said it's always going straight forward there is no part of an armor in a Christian armor right for the back part of you right it's always a breastplates always in front there is nothing for the back right because there's no going back when they went across Jordan into Canaan they could go right or left you know cuz that was in the land the main point was to go straight on but they could never turn and come back out so you can't do that is straightforward if none goes with me then I'll go myself cuz that's what we got to believe every one of us has got to have that personal point in our mind to believe and say it's straight straight forward don't tur it back just going on down the road and that way if anybody wants to go with you then you always give a hi at hand say come on let's go together and you know what you find out then there a lot of people want to go with you you know Elijah thought one time he thought now Lord I'm the only one the Lord said no I've got a few thousand back that's doing the same thing you do and they just kind of undercover and they need somebody to stir them up a little and now you've done that and everything will work on so let's just move on go on forward in the promised land yes cuz that's where we're we're at let's sing one more in the SP [Music] book I believe it's to 75 in the red book about B flat I was sing deep the for singing to rise no more but the master of the SLE her My desing Cry On The Water now love me love with me when nothing else could help thank God for his love good it be nothing all my heart in his his prous so mighty

high his love out of the angry way he's the master of the his will be your savior to be sa to think about how far down God had to come you and I me Meen just make sure you tell brother re let youe message we believe it we believe that God has been with us for 40 years to bring us to a place to stand and and be a beacon of light for you know the people that can can listen and and try to hear and we you know for a long time I would never I wanted to go out on the field and try to help some and but I found out I couldn't do it it just didn't work CU people just didn't want me and things like that to to go and preach for them but then God gave us an opportunity to open up the internet where that anybody wanted to listen could listen right and you know a lot of preachers don't like that because they they're upset because somebody hears more than than what they're saying and things and they get all upset and all but you know I've never claimed to have all the answers but I claim to know a God that knows all and that way then I you know my way of saying it smart SM man is not somebody that knows everything cuz his mind is too full a smart man is a person that knows where to go to somebody that knows the answer that's a smart one cuz then that way you can go and you can just get the answer and come back and everything's fine so that's all I've ever tried to be to anybody I will not go on the internet and be an internet preacher we do not encourage that we encourage you go to your churches and you pray and you do you know and even pastors will write questions and I won't even answer the pastor's questions because I'm not going to get on the internet system you know to do that because I have no nothing to do I'm just a preacher of the Gospel if somebody wants to hear then we just rejoice and and go on and I encourage you out there to go to your home churches and back your pastor you know CU if you hear anything just just thank God from what you hear and move on Amen and if you'll go as the prophet said one day he said go back to them churches and he said if you'll let your light shine he said your pastor will be very proud of you now some of them might not be but I can't help that but you know really true pastors will they'll be proud and they'll say well thank you you know glad you told us that we needed to answer because the Lord has blessed us you love him looking forward to tomorrow just pray for brother Reed tonight that the Lord would bless him and then looking forward to a time to be together and to Fellowship together and and just say thank you Lord and then we'll have the meal together eating together fellowshipping and no evening service now we just be having a time in the Lord fellowshipping together okay pray one for another the Lord would bless father we thank you we ask you to just bless us with your love and understanding thank you for the message that we've heard tonight that our brother has preached to us of a unity in the body of Christ Lord because we don't believe and never have believ that we're all of the body we believe we're just a part that it's suround the world that there's the little body of Christ is forming in you and getting ready for that day and we haste pray Lord hasten the day because what would we want to stay much longer because everything is falling apart we love you and we thank you and let's
