tractor on the mountain brother I said he said one of the threats in one day in history where nation had forgotten God for the people have become formal and different when the priesthood all went with modern trend the prophets prophesy according to the will of the priests and in that day as you they had one man that what they thought was that fanatic you talk about women weren't paint and everything he was carving wall what sort of a God and this old fella had come down and said to the king not even do whose won't a call I'm Taylor call for what become again and we find out then that he had hidden himself and ran away from it he hid out and their wilderness somewhere they come company had thought that maybe that he is start to death her prayers but he had been fed pretty without on water too and there he was calm down and said do you see that I had God sent the Lord now if you're not convinced yet let's go up to the top of the mountain and prove was God or he had another vision from the Lord he said choose you and alter and make it and choose and not sustain them on making an altar of the Lord and also I will put off on mine and we'll both make this sacrifice and that the god this God answered he would have by no means Dom dead if the Lord head and told him he said no later are done this at all this that you command or what's the attraction it's got four hundred priests standing on the hill and the king up there and his chariot with it all of his armor and Garston around and there's ol rusty face looking man ball headed and the hairs hanging down space beasts of ships came wrapped around them tears all over his body standing up there with a stick in his hand and a crucible on the other hand that just said three years and I had before they not even do with Paul Tillich all from it but taken that place of God with such things as halos and shadows and all they talked about and here the old fanatics been out there on the hill bringing all these people up there what was abstraction it was God fixing to vindicate his prophet to be right it was God fulfilling prophecy God also making history fulfilling his word Jesus and the authority of the world the light of the great prophet of old Jehovah's great witness when he had went to mark Carmel call up Israel before Bailey to see which was God he said a Bailey because certain if God be God certain when God not in him with this inspiration give him as vision told him to do things and he went out there and call all the prophets of faith let them make a sacrifice they scream and cut themselves no God Elisha kill the bullet laid it upon the rock the altar said Lord let it be known that our God and I am your servant and said I did all of this that you command shown that an order showed him what to do and he will feel the vision and notice olam bara God fell out of the heavens and consumed the sacrifice he had a ring for three years and six months Gus preparation and so God prepares and sent voices a warning and he's always made a preparation just before we sent eliza up on the Mount Carmel there to prove that he was God and the nation have gone wrong well he satellites out together one and to make preparation of these things and he always does that but provides the way every time for the people and a that people rejected his mercy there's only one thing left to do and that is for his judgment Josefa meeting his burden even Elijah after being the school of the prophets why when he went up there they went it they wanted him to leave he said it's just too straight here you see they had one of these religious leaders of his day and I just separated himself to Mount Carmel what John the Baptist separated himself there I went to the school to learn their theology by Gaza and to the wilderness to preparing for work what does the here and the showed none came and showdown has come again and Elijah up on Mount Carmel when they thought that it all that is the miracles were past there could not be nothing else like miracles there well it was one man who believed it and he said bring up all your profits bring them up here on the mountain and that school see was God loved the scriptures a true sign now upon Mount Carmel the day when he called a showdown and he called a band that thousands of priests they belonged to the temple other denominations he called them up on Mount Carmel State come up here and meet me up here I'll stand the whole bunch what did he do he had thus said the Lord he wasn't afraid to say offer up a bullet I'm common being bigger that the God

little louder maybe he's gone on fishing trip or something he's at a pursuit of something for he had thus said the Lord he was satisfied he had the Word of God and their brother and brother a sister what more does any man meet than a promise of God God said he would do as Abraham he kind of God able to perform or his book about he knew that God could do it because God said so confirmation on
