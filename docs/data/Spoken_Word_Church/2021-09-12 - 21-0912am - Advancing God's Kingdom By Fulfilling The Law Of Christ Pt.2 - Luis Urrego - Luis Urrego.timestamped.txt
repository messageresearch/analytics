[1:14] just his humility
[1:16] and that always grabbed your attention
[1:18] and not only that but that he was always
[1:20] it was so friendly to anybody he would
[1:23] always get down to their level
[1:25] no matter if it was a little kid no

[2:01] far distant way
[2:03] but i'll speed up and they'll slow down

[2:21] telling us come on let's
[2:23] keep going keep moving amen this thing's
[2:25] just about about done
[2:27] and uh
[2:28] we just thank god for that
[2:31] praise the lord jesus i don't want to
[2:32] keep you all standing too long so um
[2:34] let's just go ahead go ahead and go to
[2:36] the word of the lord
[2:38] uh we're going to read from john chapter
[2:40] 15 john chapter 15. and i i want to
[2:43] continue on what i started a few weeks
[2:45] ago about a week or two ago on
[2:48] advancing god's kingdom by fulfilling
[2:50] the law of christ and this is part two
[2:53] and
[2:55] so let's let's just let's just go to the
[2:57] lord in prayer our heavenly father we
[3:00] thank you lord once again for the
[3:01] opportunity that you've
[3:03] given us lord to gather together in your
[3:05] name lord we thank you father for
[3:10] lord all that you are doing father god
[3:12] everything that you've done and all that
[3:14] you will do lord
[3:16] sometimes the father even though we
[3:17] don't understand
[3:19] the things that you
[3:20] allow or permit in our lives but lord
[3:23] god there for our own good lord because
[3:25] you said father in your word that all
[3:27] things
[3:29] work together for good to them that love
[3:31] god
[3:32] and lord we just uh thank you father for
[3:35] the privileged lord that we have that we
[3:38] can have confidence in you father in
[3:39] this hour knowing that you know all
[3:42] things
[3:42] lord bless your word now father as we're
[3:45] getting ready to
[3:46] open back the pages of it lord we ask
[3:48] that you were just anointed lord help us
[3:51] to say something that would edify
[3:53] the people lord and that you would be
[3:55] glorified lord jesus and help us lord
[3:57] give us revelation understanding father
[4:00] from your word
[4:01] for certainly lord we are living in the
[4:03] last days father and lord how much
[4:06] father god that we're living in the last
[4:08] days how much more lord we should
[4:11] come together lord god in unity lord
[4:14] amongst each other
[4:15] lord as your little bride lord jesus
[4:18] just as the as the body lord god works
[4:20] together father
[4:22] and you father be in the head lord we
[4:25] have a head father physically on our
[4:27] bodies and it all functions together
[4:29] lord god there's not one pulling in one
[4:32] way not another part pulling another way
[4:34] but lord god it all works together and
[4:37] when one father god is is damaged lord
[4:40] the rest of the body hurts father
[4:42] and so lord jesus we just
[4:44] pray father that you would help us to
[4:46] have that mindset lord that what we
[4:48] do father god
[4:50] against you lord god maybe we think we
[4:52] may be doing it lord on our own nobody
[4:55] else knows but lord god ultimately it
[4:57] hurts the body lord and we just pray
[4:59] heavenly father to help us to be mindful
[5:01] of these things
[5:03] we just commit this time now into your
[5:04] hands bless those lord they're sick
[5:07] and continue to strengthen their bodies
[5:09] lord we thank you for the good reports
[5:11] that we've been hearing and we just
[5:13] appreciate lord god what you are doing
[5:15] now we ask these things in jesus
[5:17] christ's name
[5:18] amen
[5:19] praise the lord
[5:20] amen let's just read john chapter 15.
[5:24] started at verse 8 it says herein is my
[5:26] father glorified that ye bear much fruit
[5:30] so shall ye be my disciples
[5:33] amen so you want to be a disciple of the
[5:35] lord you you bear fruit you have to bear
[5:37] fruit
[5:38] as the father hath loved me
[5:41] so have i loved you and then he says
[5:45] here continue ye in my love
[5:48] if you keep my commandments
[5:50] ye shall abide in my love
[5:53] notice how he he continues talking about
[5:55] love
[5:56] even as i have kept my father's
[5:58] commandments and abide in his love
[6:02] these things have i spoken unto you that
[6:04] my joy might remain
[6:06] in you and that your joy might be full
[6:10] verse 12 this is my commandment that ye
[6:13] love one another
[6:16] he didn't say it was his suggestion
[6:18] but he said this is my commandment that
[6:21] ye love one another as i have loved you
[6:25] greater love hath no man than this that
[6:27] a man lay down his life
[6:29] for his friends now you think about that
[6:32] are you willing to do that can you love
[6:34] so much can you love the brotherhood the
[6:36] sisters so much that you are willing to
[6:38] lay down your life for him for them
[6:41] ye are my friends if if ye do whatsoever
[6:45] i command you this is jesus speaking
[6:48] these things i command you
[6:51] that ye love one another amen and then
[6:54] in galatians chapter 6 verse 2 it says
[6:57] bear ye one another's burdens and so
[7:01] fulfill the law of christ
[7:04] amen god bless you you may be seated
[7:06] this half this morning
[7:08] amen in
[7:09] in the contemporary english version that
[7:11] says you obey the law of christ when you
[7:14] offer each other a helping hand amen so
[7:17] that's what we're we've been discussing
[7:19] here is the law of christ amen we we we
[7:23] last time when we were talking about we
[7:25] were talking about the uh the
[7:28] the commandments and how god in his
[7:31] commandments in the old testament when
[7:32] he gave forth his commandment he he he
[7:35] talked about he talked about love within
[7:37] his commandments and and we're just kind
[7:39] of just go over here just just a little
[7:41] review for those that may may have
[7:43] missed
[7:44] what we talked about but um
[7:47] if you read in matthew chapter 24 we uh
[7:50] in verse 9 through 14 we won't read it
[7:52] all but
[7:54] in verse 12 it says that in the last
[7:56] days because of iniquity amen shall
[7:59] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[8:03] amen in other words it'll dwindle it it
[8:06] it'll dwindle and uh and we're we're
[8:09] seeing that today amen i mean we've
[8:11] we've been seeing it for for for years
[8:14] but we see it even more and more amen
[8:17] the love of many shall wax cold because
[8:20] of iniquity abounding because of so much
[8:23] sin abounding amen and we talked about
[8:25] what iniquity was and what it is is
[8:27] gross immorality or injustice or
[8:30] wickedness amen the condition of one
[8:33] without law or lawlessness
[8:35] and it's certainly getting to that point
[8:37] amen in the in the day and time that we
[8:39] are living in uh uh as i said mentioned
[8:42] last time you know you don't even have
[8:43] to even look in the news to see the
[8:46] lawlessness and the and the attitude
[8:48] that people have taken in the in this
[8:50] day and time and it's certainly the the
[8:53] the the spirit of laodicea my rights
[8:56] it's what i i it's about me being happy
[9:00] i don't care what you think it's about
[9:01] me being happy
[9:03] my body my choice you know and all these
[9:06] things amen and and so that's that's the
[9:10] type of age that we are living in now
[9:12] amen it doesn't matter what you do don't
[9:14] matter
[9:15] what you think about me it's what i
[9:17] think was what i
[9:19] and that's what i'll do and so that's
[9:20] that's
[9:21] that is uh it's it's a form of
[9:23] selfishness amen people don't people
[9:26] don't live for each other anymore they
[9:28] care for what they can get for
[9:29] themselves
[9:30] and so um brother branham he talked
[9:33] about what iniquity was and and part of
[9:36] uh
[9:37] four four things that that he mentioned
[9:39] and you read these things through quotes
[9:41] um one of the things he mentioned about
[9:43] iniquity is that it it has it has a
[9:46] hypocrisy involved in it amen because
[9:50] brother branham says here and you know
[9:51] that god's word is right why do you play
[9:54] the hypocrite amen another another
[9:57] attribute of of iniquity is blatant
[9:59] disobedience
[10:01] um
[10:02] brother brown says here see and it's
[10:04] right before you that you shouldn't do
[10:05] it but yet you still do it
[10:07] amen
[10:08] people don't care nowadays
[10:10] people it doesn't matter to them amen
[10:12] what you say or what the word of god
[10:14] says what what even their parents told
[10:16] them taught them when they were growing
[10:17] up amen it doesn't matter anymore
[10:20] it's just what i can get out of life
[10:22] pride and another attribute of iniquity
[10:25] pride and self-centeredness
[10:27] amen when you know your creeds are wrong
[10:29] and you still hold to it amen you can
[10:32] show somebody that they're wrong even
[10:34] from the word of god and they'll still
[10:36] want to acknowledge it they still
[10:39] that pride won't let them see or let
[10:42] them humble themselves amen because of
[10:45] because of an in iniquity
[10:47] and then another attribute of iniquity
[10:49] is that it begins in the heart and
[10:51] eventually it manifests outwardly so
[10:54] yeah iniquity doesn't just start you
[10:55] don't start just being
[10:57] you know iniquitous i guess you could
[10:59] say that amen it begins from the heart
[11:01] it's things that you start thinking
[11:03] about
[11:04] it's things that that you start
[11:06] meditating and pondering and man it was
[11:08] it was uh uh korra and dathan when when
[11:12] moses was bringing them out of the
[11:14] children of israel out of egypt and even
[11:16] probably as they were coming out of
[11:18] egypt cora and nathan were already
[11:20] starting to think who is
[11:22] who is this moses you know that you know
[11:24] started trying to lift themselves up a
[11:26] little bit you know and and
[11:28] and say well god just doesn't bless
[11:30] moses god just doesn't go work through
[11:32] moses but god can also work through us
[11:35] as well you see and all that just
[11:36] started lifting up eventually it turned
[11:38] into iniquity and we know where we're
[11:40] eventually dathan and korra ended up
[11:43] amen so that that is that is iniquity
[11:45] and it starts in the heart amen
[11:47] and um
[11:49] and so we see that the love of many
[11:51] shall wax cold amen iniquity will be
[11:54] abundant in this day there's plenty of
[11:56] iniquity but in the love of many will
[11:58] dwindle not completely go away it says
[12:01] the love of many shall wax cold doesn't
[12:04] mean that it'll completely go away but
[12:06] but but to to many
[12:09] it will dwindle
[12:10] yeah
[12:12] and then when you look at that word
[12:13] their love is the is the word agape
[12:16] which is the love the love of god amen
[12:20] less and less we see in the love of god
[12:22] when god is calling us for love and
[12:25] unity more in this hour
[12:27] we allow the externals a man to let that
[12:30] love dwindle from one another
[12:32] now that is god's fault that's our fault
[12:35] amen so we should watch that especially
[12:38] as the bride of christ amen we should be
[12:40] in unity we should be in love and
[12:41] harmony amen maybe we don't agree with
[12:44] everything we
[12:45] and you might have a different opinion
[12:46] than i do but even yet amen the word of
[12:49] god is the common ground that we have
[12:52] the message of the hour is where we can
[12:54] all put our faith and trust and rest
[12:56] upon amen if you think that you can just
[12:59] because somebody doesn't agree with you
[13:01] politically or doesn't see a world view
[13:03] that you see amen doesn't mean that you
[13:05] have to hate your brother or hate your
[13:07] sister amen amen this is what should put
[13:09] us amen this is our common ground amen
[13:12] it's the word of god praise the lord
[13:14] amen
[13:16] and then there's many times but we read
[13:19] different uh uh quotes where brother
[13:21] branham talked about the love of manny
[13:22] wax and cold uh he he said something
[13:25] here we got plenty of teaching plenty of
[13:28] churches but we need a love of god amen
[13:31] so we have plenty of that
[13:33] amen
[13:34] but the love of many are still waxing
[13:36] cold why because we allow the things of
[13:38] this life we allow other things to grab
[13:41] more of our tension and and to take hold
[13:44] of our hearts instead of the word of god
[13:46] taking hold of your heart and when the
[13:48] word of god takes hold of your heart
[13:50] which is him amen your love should
[13:52] increase
[13:53] amen the love of god the agape love
[13:56] should increase in your life amen praise
[13:59] the lord jesus now i'm just reviewing
[14:01] again you just bear with me
[14:03] amen
[14:05] uh
[14:06] brother brown said that there's no
[14:07] feeling nowadays you know no feeling no
[14:10] trust i mean we don't we don't we don't
[14:11] trust anybody
[14:13] there's no affection for love
[14:15] anymore amen
[14:17] and uh
[14:19] and then we we read there in john 15 10
[14:22] where jesus said if you keep my
[14:24] commandments ye shall abide in my love
[14:26] amen and so we talked about how in in
[14:28] the old testament the ten commandments
[14:31] were given uh we read in exodus chapter
[14:33] 20 uh and in verse six it says and
[14:36] showing mercy unto thousands of them
[14:38] that love me and keep my commandments so
[14:42] love was part of the original
[14:43] commandments of god amen and then jesus
[14:46] go comes along in mark chapter 12 and we
[14:49] don't we won't read it all but there
[14:51] there he uh a scribe came to him and
[14:54] asked him lord what is the greatest
[14:56] commandment and uh he and and jesus told
[14:59] him and thou shalt love the lord thy god
[15:02] with all
[15:04] well actually verse 29 says and jesus
[15:06] answered him the first of all the
[15:07] commandments is hear o israel the lord
[15:09] our god is one lord and then he
[15:11] continues and says and thou shalt love
[15:13] the lord thy god with all thy heart and
[15:16] with all thy soul and with all thy mind
[15:19] and with all thy strength
[15:21] amen then then he says here and the
[15:23] second is like it's like namely this
[15:25] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[15:29] and then he says there is none other
[15:31] commandment greater than these
[15:35] it wasn't he didn't give him you know
[15:37] you shall not steal you shall not commit
[15:40] adultery you shall not bear
[15:42] false witness or anything like that he
[15:44] said thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[15:46] thyself there is none other commandment
[15:48] greater than these that he was talking
[15:50] about so so love is the greater
[15:54] commandment
[15:55] but in order for you to have that love
[15:57] in you amen in order for you to express
[15:59] that love you've got to have the love in
[16:01] you
[16:01] in the form of the holy ghost in the
[16:03] form of the new birth praise the lord
[16:05] amen and so
[16:07] um
[16:08] then we started reading there in john
[16:09] chapter 13. now i want us to pay
[16:12] attention there to john chapter 13
[16:14] because in reading john chapter 13
[16:17] my goodness if you if if you just pay
[16:20] close attention
[16:21] attention to it
[16:23] it really the the events that took place
[16:25] they're just
[16:27] just so so tight this day
[16:30] the things that we are seeing in this
[16:32] day
[16:33] the apostasy
[16:34] uh
[16:35] the the the the humility yet that jesus
[16:38] was showing and we talked about how
[16:40] there in in verse in verse one how jesus
[16:44] knew amen that uh that he was gonna be
[16:47] glory god glorified that he god had
[16:50] given him everything amen
[16:53] and and then we read on where jesus uh
[16:57] uh where in verse two it says and supper
[17:00] being ended the devil having now put
[17:02] into the heart of judas iscariot to
[17:04] betray jesus
[17:05] so see now
[17:08] it's starting in in in judas amen satan
[17:11] put it in his heart to betray jesus
[17:14] put it in his heart amen so the satan
[17:18] comes in little by little he'll come in
[17:21] maybe by a saying there will be a saying
[17:23] and then eventually it will start it'll
[17:25] turn into it turn into a doing and then
[17:28] eventually if we're not careful it'll
[17:30] get to our minds and and we're just
[17:32] completely that is what we believe
[17:35] and we are seeing that in this the day
[17:37] that we're living in
[17:38] amen how satan has has come in so uh sly
[17:43] and has dwindled that that love amen
[17:47] that we have that we should have for one
[17:48] another
[17:50] amen jesus amen knowing that he
[17:53] he knew if you read in verse 3 there in
[17:55] chapter 13 jesus knew he had come from
[17:58] god and would go back to god he also
[18:00] knew that the father had given him
[18:02] complete power and yet there later on in
[18:05] a few verses he gets down
[18:08] and humbles himself and washes the
[18:10] disciples feet
[18:12] man what an act of humility amen what an
[18:15] act of of of
[18:18] not being self-centered
[18:20] amen the him knowing what what he was
[18:25] yet he got down to watch the disciples
[18:27] dirty feet
[18:29] amen i've always often i've always said
[18:31] and when i go to the field mission field
[18:34] is the greatest act of humility or the
[18:37] greatest preacher that had ever existed
[18:39] and that is the lord jesus christ and
[18:42] yet he got down to wash the disciples
[18:44] dirty's feet
[18:46] amen
[18:48] and it it's sometimes uh there sometimes
[18:51] us as ministers we want to get heady we
[18:53] want to get you know we want somebody
[18:55] else to wash our feet you know we want
[18:57] somebody else to do things for us we we
[18:59] you know because we're a minister but
[19:01] the real a real minister the word
[19:04] minister means one that serves
[19:06] and the greatest minister that ever
[19:08] lived was jesus christ
[19:10] greatest teacher that ever lived was
[19:12] jesus christ and yet he got down
[19:14] to wash the disciples dirty feet
[19:17] and he didn't he wasn't asked to do that
[19:20] the disciples didn't ask him to do that
[19:22] he just did it on his own
[19:24] amen why it was a lesson for us
[19:27] not just for us to do it you're here you
[19:29] know we come to church once a month but
[19:32] it was for a general lesson for all of
[19:34] us for everyday living
[19:37] amen to live your life for one another
[19:40] amen it's not just about you amen but
[19:43] it's about the others around you as well
[19:45] amen praise god
[19:47] we talked about how what humility means
[19:49] is the state of character being humble
[19:51] freedom
[19:52] from pride arrogance lowliness of mind
[19:55] the low estimate of oneself
[19:57] self-abasement amen that's humility
[20:00] that's one thing i could say differently
[20:02] about brother royale
[20:04] soriano amen he was he was just that way
[20:07] he was he didn't think anything great of
[20:09] himself
[20:11] yet yeah he was so well known
[20:13] but yet he didn't even know that that
[20:15] people
[20:16] knew and were so so touched by his
[20:19] ministry he didn't even think anybody
[20:22] uh was was being touched
[20:25] by his ministry in his life and his
[20:27] dedication and his sacrifice
[20:30] and he's touched many lives
[20:32] amen that's how we should be amen you
[20:34] want to touch someone's life amen humble
[20:36] yourself
[20:37] humble yourself
[20:39] people will look at that amen
[20:42] and then uh
[20:43] just just just still just still
[20:45] reviewing here
[20:46] you can just continue to read that there
[20:48] in john chapter 13.
[20:50] amen and then uh
[20:53] and then now we just we jus
[20:54] uh let's just well let's just start
[20:56] there in verse 18 and brother the
[20:58] brothers could bring up verse 18.
[21:00] amen
[21:02] and we'll start here amen jesus
[21:04] continues he says here i speak not of
[21:07] you all
[21:09] i know
[21:10] whom i have chosen who i have chosen
[21:14] but that the scripture may be fulfilled
[21:16] watch what the reason why he does this
[21:18] but that the scripture may be fulfilled
[21:21] he that eateth bread with me
[21:24] hath lifted up his heel
[21:26] against me
[21:28] now
[21:30] we know that judah said man he ate with
[21:32] jesus but did not eat jesus
[21:35] because jesus at one point you know how
[21:37] he said i am the bread of life and if
[21:39] you eat me you shall live you shall live
[21:42] eternally amen many people ate with
[21:44] jesus many people dined with jesus even
[21:47] simon the pharisee even some of those
[21:49] pharisees they invited jesus to eat with
[21:52] him but
[21:53] they did not they ate with jesus but
[21:55] they did not eat jesus
[21:57] in other words they did not take
[21:58] advantage of what he was trying to
[22:00] really give amen the food that he was
[22:02] really trying to give
[22:04] amen and so jesus knew amen who he had
[22:07] chosen there in that room
[22:09] where he was at with the disciples
[22:11] but that the scripture may be fulfilled
[22:14] he that eateth bread with me hath lifted
[22:16] up his heel against me jesus had no
[22:19] other purpose in this life when he came
[22:21] here on earth but to fulfill the word of
[22:22] god
[22:24] and that is that should be the desire
[22:26] and that should be the heart and our
[22:28] mindset here on earth as sons and
[22:30] daughters of god is to fulfill the word
[22:34] of god
[22:35] amen to fulfill to fulfill his word in
[22:39] other words to keep
[22:40] his commandments amen
[22:43] and so
[22:44] in hebrews chapter 6 verse 4 through 6
[22:47] it says for it is impossible for those
[22:49] who were once enlightened
[22:51] and have
[22:52] watched it says it's impossible
[22:55] for those who were once enlightened and
[22:56] have tasted of the heavenly gift and
[22:58] were made partakers of the holy ghost
[23:01] and have tasted the good word of god and
[23:04] the powers of the world to come
[23:06] if they shall fall away to renew them
[23:08] again
[23:09] unto repentance seeing they crucified to
[23:12] themselves the son of god afresh and put
[23:14] him to an open shame amen you received
[23:17] the word for your day you received the
[23:19] the word for for for for your hour and
[23:22] and and and you reject it you leave it
[23:25] aside amen for something else for your
[23:28] own opinion for your own amen your own
[23:30] iniquity overtakes that
[23:33] amen there is nothing else that god can
[23:35] do for you
[23:36] amen
[23:38] there
[23:39] it's hard amen like in verse six there
[23:42] if they shall fall away to renew them
[23:44] again unto repentance it's hard for them
[23:47] for people like that amen they have
[23:49] taken on a spirit such as that to even
[23:52] repent again for what they did amen
[23:55] they're so hardened now amen they're so
[23:58] they're so hard
[24:00] but it's impossible for those that have
[24:02] been who were once enlightened
[24:05] and have tasted of the heavenly gift and
[24:07] made partakers of the holy ghost
[24:10] to fall away
[24:11] amen
[24:13] let's just think about that
[24:15] to really have the holy spirit because
[24:17] the holy spirit the bible said the holy
[24:19] spirit will lead us and guide us unto
[24:21] all truth
[24:23] now when someone supposedly tasted of
[24:26] the holy ghost amen
[24:28] to then fall away god doesn't god is not
[24:31] an indian giver
[24:32] god doesn't lose those that are his amen
[24:36] so you take that for what it's worth
[24:37] amen but we're seeing that a lot in the
[24:39] hour that we're living in
[24:41] people who we thought were just
[24:43] you know
[24:44] just
[24:45] firm and will you know been in this
[24:47] message for 40 years or more
[24:50] and then we hear that they're falling
[24:52] away that they're they don't believe
[24:53] this word anymore amen how can you not
[24:56] believe that god sent to us a prophet in
[24:58] this day when the when the word of god
[25:00] amen talks about a prophet coming in
[25:02] this end time
[25:04] then pray tell me who it is
[25:07] if it's not the prophet that god sent us
[25:09] in this day
[25:10] amen somebody's got to fulfill malachi
[25:13] chapter four
[25:14] uh uh uh somebody's gotta fulfill
[25:17] revelation the the angel that was in
[25:19] revelations chapter three for the the
[25:21] angel laodicea somebody's gotta fulfill
[25:24] that somebody's gonna fulfill
[25:26] revelations chapter 10 verse 7 amen
[25:29] where it talks about in the days of the
[25:32] voice of the seventh angel who is that
[25:34] then
[25:35] if if it isn't the prophet that god sent
[25:37] in this day
[25:40] his ministry the way it went and the way
[25:42] it went so so closely knit together to
[25:46] the ministry of moses elijah in in in
[25:49] the word then then who is it
[25:52] and we're still waiting for them then
[25:55] but you see we're not
[25:57] those that were enlightened amen really
[25:59] have the holy spirit the holy spirit
[26:00] will lead and guide you to all truth
[26:02] amen
[26:04] praise god
[26:06] and so
[26:08] all right so let's read verse 19 there
[26:10] in john chapter 13.
[26:14] now watch watch what jesus says here i
[26:16] just pay close attention and and and put
[26:18] yourself in this scene
[26:20] all right put yourself in this scene but
[26:22] pretend that you were there watching the
[26:24] disciples and jesus they're eating
[26:28] together amen because jesus had a full
[26:30] purpose of what was going on there in
[26:32] this scene now i tell you before it come
[26:36] that when it is come
[26:39] when it has come to pass
[26:41] ye may believe that i am he
[26:44] amen
[26:45] so jesus was warning them already the
[26:48] disciples there was warning them already
[26:50] of the apostasy that was get ready to
[26:52] take place
[26:54] just as the word has forewarned us of
[26:57] the apostasy that was to take place in
[26:59] this our day amen we read that in first
[27:02] and first timothy chapter four verse one
[27:04] and two i appreciate brother joe back
[27:06] there helping out with these scriptures
[27:08] amen first timothy chapter four
[27:10] look
[27:11] look just as jesus forewarned the
[27:13] disciples look at timothy forewarning us
[27:16] now the spirit speaketh expressly that
[27:18] in the latter times
[27:20] some
[27:21] shall depart from the faith
[27:25] giving heed to seducing spirits and
[27:28] watch and doctrines of devils
[27:32] that it says that in the latter times
[27:34] are we living in the latter times
[27:37] in the latter times some not all but
[27:40] some shall depart from the faith the
[27:42] faith
[27:43] amen giving heed to seducing spirits and
[27:47] doctrines of devils amen
[27:50] what's verse 2 there speaking lies in
[27:53] hypocrisy
[27:55] having their conscience seared
[27:59] with a hot
[28:00] iron you know when you sear something
[28:04] amen
[28:06] it's flat you know or or it's it's it
[28:08] it's you know you sear meat you know
[28:11] it's it stays that way now you know
[28:14] it's flat it's it's you see
[28:17] speaking lies in hypocrisy and that is
[28:20] one of the key things that you'll notice
[28:22] some of these people leaving the mess
[28:23] i'm just going to just be blunt amen
[28:25] some of the people just leaving the
[28:26] message amen
[28:29] they they start speaking
[28:31] things out of the word taking things out
[28:33] of context
[28:35] amen so that they can fit their own
[28:37] agendas
[28:38] amen that's what timothy is talking
[28:40] about speaking lies and hypocrisy
[28:44] but having their conscience seared
[28:47] my goodness in other words
[28:49] no they are they believe that they are
[28:52] so right about what what
[28:54] this newfound thing that they just found
[28:57] because to them leaving the message is
[29:00] freedom
[29:02] they feel so free and they feel so
[29:04] so uh i was so bound for so many years
[29:08] and and now i'm free especially the
[29:09] women i mean you have websites out there
[29:12] dedicated to women that were freed from
[29:14] the message
[29:15] and they give testimony of how free i am
[29:18] now and when you look at their pictures
[29:20] you know they look they look like
[29:21] lesbians now they look well tattooed up
[29:24] and and have painted hair and stuff like
[29:26] that where's the freedom in that
[29:29] you know
[29:30] and just because you had one bad
[29:32] experience in your lifetime doesn't mean
[29:34] that the rest of the message or the rest
[29:36] of the people
[29:37] that serve god and that love this
[29:39] message lived that way
[29:41] i know that there's bad apples out there
[29:44] amen i know that there's ba ministers
[29:46] who who are just so dogmatic and
[29:48] legalistic and and and and just knocking
[29:51] people upside the head with the word of
[29:53] god and you better serve you you know
[29:56] you better love the lord and you better
[29:57] do this that and the other amen you're
[29:59] never going to get anybody to serve god
[30:02] with all their heart when you when when
[30:03] some when a minister comes out that way
[30:06] they just nobody they'll do it for a
[30:09] time they'll do it out of fear
[30:11] and that i believe that that's what has
[30:13] happened in the last 40 years that we've
[30:14] been in the message amen
[30:17] ministers preachers not all of them
[30:19] there's been some really good ones out
[30:20] there that really know the balance of
[30:23] the word
[30:24] but there's been some bad apples but
[30:26] that doesn't mean the message is wrong
[30:29] that means their deliverance was wrong
[30:32] that means their approach to it was
[30:33] wrong maybe the revelation that they had
[30:35] of it was wrong but doesn't mean that
[30:38] the word of god is wrong and that the
[30:40] prophet the message that the prophet
[30:42] sent to us amen or gave us in this day
[30:44] by the holy spirit amen is wrong it
[30:47] isn't
[30:48] amen
[30:50] so you can't throw out like they say you
[30:52] can't throw the
[30:53] baby out with the bath water amen
[30:56] praise god
[30:59] all right let's continue reading john
[31:01] chapter 13 verse and here in verse 20.
[31:05] now watch
[31:06] verily jesus spiel still speaking verily
[31:09] verily i say unto you
[31:12] he that receiveth
[31:14] he that receiveth whomsoever i send
[31:17] receiveth me
[31:19] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[31:21] that sent me now now it is very
[31:23] interesting because in verse 19 he says
[31:25] now i tell you before it come
[31:27] that when it is come to pass ye may
[31:29] believe that i am he so in other words
[31:32] he's forewarning them of the apostasy
[31:35] and then he comes in and talks about
[31:37] he that receiveth whomsoever i send
[31:42] receiveth me now why why would he say
[31:44] something like that amen
[31:46] because remember in one place he jesus
[31:48] says
[31:49] he that receiveth a prophet in the name
[31:51] of a prophet shall receive a prophet's
[31:53] reward
[31:55] amen
[31:58] he that receiveth whomsoever i send
[32:00] receiveth me and he that receiveth me
[32:02] receiveth him that sent me amen so
[32:06] in other words amen
[32:08] you received those that god sent
[32:10] you recognize that that is a man of god
[32:12] or or receive
[32:15] we're talking about the prophet for our
[32:16] day amen you recognize that ministry
[32:18] wasn't brother branham's ministry it
[32:20] wasn't his own ministry it was the
[32:22] ministry of god through him amen
[32:25] it wasn't brother branham's message it
[32:27] was the message of god amen to brother
[32:30] brown brother branham could not restore
[32:32] the word back to us that it had been
[32:35] eaten down throughout all the ages he
[32:37] could not have done it by himself
[32:39] it had to be in god to do that but
[32:42] because the bible says that in amos 3 8
[32:45] that he will not do anything unless he
[32:47] shows it first to his servants the
[32:50] prophets
[32:51] amen so he must and he has to use a
[32:55] prophet he he's got to use an individual
[32:58] amen and you will receive a benefit or
[33:01] you will receive a reward if you receive
[33:03] that whomsoever he's rece he sends you
[33:07] because who if you receive him
[33:09] amen you receive the word he's saying
[33:11] you receive him and then eventually
[33:12] you're receiving the father as jesus
[33:14] says here he that receiveth me
[33:17] jesus being their messenger for their
[33:19] day
[33:20] receives the father amen
[33:22] receives the one that sent him
[33:25] i hope that you're understanding what
[33:27] what i'm trying to say with that
[33:29] it's just very interesting that that is
[33:30] in there
[33:31] amen
[33:33] that verse is in there then in verse 21
[33:35] when jesus had thus said he was troubled
[33:39] in spirit after he had said that he was
[33:42] troubled in spirit and testified and
[33:44] said
[33:45] verily verily i say unto you
[33:48] when jesus says verily verily that means
[33:51] absolutely absolutely for sure
[33:54] i say i'm saying to you that one of you
[33:57] shall betray me
[33:59] one of you
[34:01] it wasn't one of the one of the somebody
[34:04] that was outside of the room that they
[34:06] were in or one of the pharisees will
[34:08] betray me no one of you will betray me
[34:12] amen
[34:13] do you know saints the ones that will
[34:15] sadden you the most are the ones that
[34:16] are closest to you
[34:19] your own family members are the ones
[34:21] that will will will will will sadden you
[34:24] the most
[34:27] and it was it was the same with with
[34:29] jesus amen
[34:30] it was one of his that he chose himself
[34:33] that he picked
[34:34] and that he gave power and you read in
[34:37] matthew chapter 10 he gave power
[34:40] to all the disciples including judas to
[34:42] cast out devils heal the sick and and
[34:44] all those all those all
[34:46] preach
[34:48] but none of that amen judas was
[34:50] justified sanctified
[34:52] but never got to the holy ghost
[34:56] why because he let satan talk to
[34:58] start working in his heart
[35:00] verse 22 then the disciples looked at
[35:03] one another doubting o whom he spake
[35:06] now here's jesus telling them one of you
[35:08] will betray me
[35:10] and the disciples are looking at one
[35:11] another
[35:13] what
[35:14] one of us what
[35:17] because judas was so like them
[35:21] was so much like them in in
[35:25] that they didn't even they didn't even
[35:27] even realize or think that it was judas
[35:29] there would be judas
[35:32] you see saints we've been we've been
[35:34] we've been a a fellowship and with all
[35:36] these brethren and all these people that
[35:38] have left the message through for years
[35:41] gone to fellowship meetings with them
[35:43] had meetings with them and shook their
[35:46] hands hugged their necks heard them
[35:47] preach and and do all that
[35:50] and you would never have thought that it
[35:52] would be one of them to eventually leave
[35:54] this word
[35:57] that's exactly what's happening in this
[35:58] hour and so that's the reason why we we
[36:01] looked at one another what
[36:04] he did what she did what
[36:06] that's what the disciples are doing when
[36:08] jesus said
[36:10] one of you will betray me they're like
[36:11] what
[36:14] and then now they're
[36:15] they it should start causing something
[36:18] in you lord i hope it's not me i hope
[36:21] it's not me amen it should send the holy
[36:23] fear in you amen
[36:25] lord i don't want to betray you
[36:27] i don't want to betray you
[36:29] now i'm just wondering if if if judas
[36:32] was
[36:33] looking with them you know
[36:35] he probably was he probably maybe looked
[36:37] at peter and said
[36:39] you know knowing what he was already
[36:42] working in his heart
[36:44] you see how sly people people can be
[36:46] when satan is working in their heart
[36:49] that total hypocrites
[36:52] total total uh uh uh just
[36:56] mind seared
[36:58] they'll just play the part so easily and
[37:00] you will miss it so easily
[37:04] this is what's happening here in this in
[37:06] this chapter
[37:09] amen the one that was to betray jesus
[37:11] was so
[37:12] intertwined with the disciples
[37:14] that they couldn't figure out who it
[37:16] could be that jesus was talking about
[37:18] amen it remind reminds me of the parable
[37:21] amen of the wheat and the tares amen and
[37:25] brother joe if you could bring that that
[37:27] matthew chapter 13. we'll just read this
[37:29] real quick here in matthew 13 it's verse
[37:32] 24 he says here
[37:35] and it's interesting that this is
[37:36] matthew chapter 13 just like john
[37:38] chapter 13.
[37:40] amen
[37:41] i don't think that's a coincidence
[37:44] another parable verse 24 another parable
[37:46] put forth put he forth unto them saying
[37:48] the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of
[37:51] heaven we're talking about a kingdom
[37:53] amen
[37:54] the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man
[37:56] which sowed good seed in his field but
[37:58] while man slept his enemy came
[38:02] and sowed tares among the we who was the
[38:04] one that put that into judas's heart
[38:07] it was satan
[38:08] the enemy came and sowed tares among the
[38:11] wheat and went his way
[38:13] but when the blade was sprung up and
[38:15] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[38:16] tares also
[38:18] amen so the servants of the householder
[38:21] came and said unto him sir that is not
[38:23] thou sow good seed in thy field from
[38:26] once then hath it tears in other words
[38:29] lord didn't you sow good seed in this
[38:31] field amen why is there tares why are
[38:34] there weeds then
[38:37] verse 28 he said unto them an enemy hath
[38:40] done this
[38:41] amen the servant said unto him well thou
[38:44] then that we go and gather them up in
[38:47] other words they were asking him should
[38:49] we go ahead and just pluck out those
[38:51] weeds
[38:52] now watch what jesus says here in this
[38:54] parable he said
[38:56] nay in other words no
[38:58] lest while ye gather up the weeds or the
[39:01] tares
[39:02] ye also root up the wheat with them
[39:08] so
[39:09] leave them alone watch in verse 30 let
[39:12] both grow together until the harvest
[39:17] right and then the time of harvest i
[39:19] will say to the reapers gather ye
[39:21] together the first
[39:23] first the tares and bind them in bundles
[39:26] to burn them but gather the wheat into
[39:30] my barn
[39:32] now brother joe i don't know if you got
[39:33] these these pictures
[39:35] i sent you two pictures
[39:37] um
[39:38] the first one
[39:41] and you could go back uh i believe i
[39:43] preached the message back in 2016 called
[39:45] put in or put on
[39:46] where i talked about the wheat and tares
[39:49] kind of went deep and you can go back
[39:50] and listen to that
[39:52] but but this is this is this is wheat
[39:56] and that is that is a terror that is a
[39:58] plant
[39:59] uh what is the name of that plant
[40:02] it's called the darnell weed
[40:05] and that weed that that that plant grows
[40:09] with the wheat in the field
[40:12] and it looks just like wheat
[40:16] and it's so easy
[40:19] to not be able to tell them apart
[40:22] because they look a lot they look alike
[40:24] and so the next the next picture
[40:27] the difference between ripened wheat and
[40:29] tares
[40:30] amen
[40:31] i know that's not a big picture but
[40:34] one of the differences is wheat produces
[40:37] white seeds
[40:39] and while tears this darnel weed
[40:42] produces
[40:43] dark poisonous seeds
[40:49] wheat one of the other characteristics
[40:50] is that wheat bows when it's ripe
[40:53] amen when wheat is ripe amen it bows
[40:57] see how it's bowing
[41:00] it bows well when when darnell weed or
[41:03] tears when they come to their maturity
[41:07] they stick straight up
[41:09] amen
[41:10] they they they're proud and they're
[41:12] haughty
[41:14] and
[41:15] i mean don't we see that today
[41:17] these people that leave the left a
[41:18] message amen they are just so proud and
[41:21] so lifted up now and you you can't tell
[41:23] them anything and every every time you
[41:26] make you might want to say something or
[41:28] be not
[41:29] amen they lift themselves up you know
[41:31] you know and you know i'm not calling
[41:34] them terrors i'm just saying to bother
[41:36] fruit you shall know them
[41:39] let the word amen
[41:40] let the word uh say what they are amen
[41:44] i believe god has a chance amen for them
[41:47] but if they'd never repent if they're if
[41:48] that's truly down if satan has truly
[41:51] entered into their hearts
[41:53] amen there's no way to renew those
[41:55] people back
[41:56] amen
[41:58] but that's that's that's characteristics
[42:00] amen so when when a child of god amen is
[42:04] re when you're the more of the word of
[42:05] god that you get the more humble it
[42:07] should make you
[42:09] amen
[42:10] that's true wheat amen that that's why
[42:13] that's why we bow
[42:14] the more humble it should make us
[42:16] amen
[42:18] and then uh
[42:19] uh darnell weed or the or tares amen
[42:23] they stick out
[42:24] they stick out amongst amongst the
[42:27] the
[42:28] the wheat and then another
[42:31] characteristic is that weed is golden in
[42:33] color
[42:33] and the tracks
[42:36] your life should attract others around
[42:38] you amen
[42:39] it should not it should not detract
[42:42] but it should attract
[42:44] amen
[42:45] not necessarily by the things we say not
[42:48] necessarily by the things we do amen but
[42:50] but our life amen
[42:53] amen do we attract one another uh do we
[42:55] attract others or do we detract them
[42:58] amen i want to attract people amen
[43:02] and of course
[43:03] tears amen they're darker in color
[43:06] darker in color compared to the wheat
[43:08] amen so that's that you can go back and
[43:11] and you can even do a search online and
[43:13] even look at more pictures of of what
[43:16] tares and wheat look like and
[43:19] they look just alike that's why it was
[43:21] so easy for
[43:22] for that's why jesus was saying
[43:24] don't don't pull them up together don't
[43:27] pull them up together
[43:29] uh wait until they they they come to
[43:31] maturity because in in in trying to pull
[43:35] them up together at a young stage it's
[43:37] easy you'll easily pull out the true
[43:40] wheat as well
[43:41] so but let them come to maturity in
[43:43] other words let them show their colors
[43:46] jesus didn't tell
[43:48] jesus knew the whole time that when he
[43:51] when he chose judas that he would be the
[43:54] son of perdition
[43:56] he knew that the whole time but he never
[43:58] made a fuss about it
[44:00] he he just left it alone
[44:02] and waited to that here in john chapter
[44:05] 13 where judas finally showed his colors
[44:09] see
[44:10] waited to to the moment where he would
[44:12] eventually do what was really in his
[44:14] heart to do
[44:16] just leave people alone
[44:18] you can't argue with them you can't you
[44:20] can't try to sway them back
[44:23] uh if if if they're set in their heart
[44:26] that that's what they want to do there
[44:28] is nothing that you and i can say amen
[44:30] that will convince them because if the
[44:33] word doesn't convince them amen then you
[44:35] and i cannot amen we will show them the
[44:38] word if they come to us and ask us
[44:41] questions we should be willing to give
[44:43] them answers
[44:45] but don't be upset and don't get
[44:47] discouraged that you cannot sway them to
[44:50] your to the way of thinking of the word
[44:53] amen
[44:54] if it's not the word that does it if
[44:56] it's the holy spirit that doesn't sway
[44:58] people amen that doesn't bring people
[45:00] back to the word of god then you and i
[45:03] there's nothing you and i can do
[45:05] praise the lord
[45:07] amen so
[45:08] in verse 23
[45:10] verse 23 and john chapter 13
[45:13] continuing here
[45:19] so after jesus said that let
[45:21] after jesus said that in in verse 22
[45:24] then the disciples looked at one another
[45:26] doubting of whom he spake
[45:30] and then verse 23 says now there was
[45:32] leaning on jesus's bosom
[45:35] one of his disciples whom jesus loved
[45:38] at that moment when jesus was talking
[45:40] and they were eating and they were
[45:42] fellowshipping
[45:44] there was a disciple that was leaning on
[45:46] jesus bosom
[45:48] now if you if you study this closely
[45:51] it has to be john
[45:53] john was the one that was leading on but
[45:56] yet
[45:57] john's humility was so great that he
[46:00] didn't even mention his name in there
[46:03] there's other instances where john's
[46:04] humility amen the holy ghost had taken
[46:06] so much of his in his life and man he
[46:08] don't he was writing the word but he
[46:10] never mentioned his name
[46:13] almost leery of people amen who who
[46:15] write books about the message and things
[46:17] like that and they got their names
[46:19] plastered all over it amen written by
[46:21] pastor so and so you know john you know
[46:24] amen when it should be amen god gets the
[46:27] credit amen
[46:29] their their name is bigger than the name
[46:31] of the lord jesus christ
[46:35] you know
[46:36] you almost wonder what what what are
[46:38] they trying to wha what are they trying
[46:40] to portray but it wasn't so with john
[46:43] john being part writing the word of god
[46:45] that we read today he
[46:47] he says here amen
[46:49] there was a leaning on jesus bosom one
[46:51] of his disciples whom jesus loved
[46:54] he left it as that verse 24 simon peter
[46:58] therefore beckoned to him
[46:59] that he should ask who it should be of
[47:02] whom jesus spake that was going to
[47:03] betray him so
[47:05] peter was like hey
[47:07] you're leaning on jesus
[47:09] go ahead and ask him
[47:11] ask him you know
[47:13] and so that's what that that's what
[47:14] peter is
[47:15] is telling him i want you just go ahead
[47:17] and ask him
[47:18] see what you can get out of him
[47:20] so in verse 25 it says he then lying on
[47:23] jesus's breasts saith unto him lord who
[47:26] is it
[47:28] amen
[47:30] i like that that he then lying on
[47:32] jesus's breast
[47:34] amen because
[47:36] you're not going to get anything from
[47:37] god unless you're close to his breast
[47:40] unless you are feeding off the breast of
[47:42] el shaddai
[47:44] the breasted one amen you won't get
[47:47] receive anything from it but if you're
[47:49] if you hardly come to church if you
[47:51] hardly read the word if you hardly pray
[47:54] you're not going to receive from god
[47:58] amen you're not going to get amen what
[48:00] you want
[48:01] if if you can't even do the simple
[48:04] things as to lean on jesus's breast
[48:08] praise god
[48:11] and because
[48:13] jesus said ask and you will receive
[48:16] seek and you shall find jesus gives them
[48:18] an answer in verse 26
[48:21] jesus answered
[48:22] he it is to whom i shall give a sop
[48:27] when i have dipped it
[48:28] now asap is a piece of morsel of food a
[48:31] piece of food
[48:32] whom i shall give a piece of food to to
[48:36] when after i have dipped it and when he
[48:38] and watch and when he had dipped the sop
[48:41] he gave it to judas iscariot the son of
[48:44] simon
[48:46] now we don't know if jesus did this
[48:48] right away
[48:49] after after he had answered amen
[48:53] jesus did not even say his name
[48:56] jesus did not even say that it's judas
[48:59] did not even say his name amen all jesus
[49:01] did was pointed out using the food that
[49:03] they were all eating together
[49:06] pointed out with the food that they were
[49:09] all eating together amen
[49:11] and isn't that how it's been amen
[49:13] throughout the years amen
[49:15] they
[49:17] god has pointed them out amen by the
[49:20] food that we've all been eating together
[49:22] throughout all the years amen this same
[49:24] word the same message
[49:26] amen that eventually amen
[49:29] jesus points them out
[49:31] by their fruit you shall know them
[49:33] amen
[49:35] because the word will eventually point
[49:36] them out
[49:38] praise god
[49:39] and verse 27 it says and after the stop
[49:42] watch this and after the sop
[49:45] after that piece of morsel that that
[49:47] morsel of food satan entered into him
[49:51] now it wasn't now now it's not
[49:54] satan
[49:56] put in his heart
[49:57] now as satan entered into him
[50:04] and then said jesus unto him
[50:07] that thou doest do it quickly
[50:10] now he said it to him he didn't tell he
[50:12] didn't announce it to all the rest of
[50:14] the disciples he just told judas
[50:16] whatever you're going to do just go
[50:18] ahead and do it quickly amen praise god
[50:22] so
[50:23] not only was jesus trying to declare who
[50:25] it was that would betray him amen but
[50:27] above this
[50:29] jesus was letting him judas know that
[50:33] he himself knew that he would be
[50:35] betrayed by him
[50:37] and therefore because judas knew this
[50:41] jesus knew that jesus knew
[50:43] that he was going to be the one to
[50:45] betray him
[50:46] and yet he still went ahead and did it
[50:49] his iniquity was even greater
[50:53] amen it was still in his heart amen to
[50:55] do what he wanted to do and to go out
[50:58] and do the intentions that he still did
[51:00] amen
[51:02] jesus in in giving him the sop in in in
[51:05] in
[51:06] doing what he was doing he was also
[51:08] letting judas know i know what you're
[51:09] doing
[51:11] i know what you're going to do
[51:13] so just go ahead and do what you're
[51:14] doing
[51:15] but he was also giving him a chance
[51:17] a chance to go ahead and
[51:19] hey
[51:20] there's there's a way you can stop what
[51:22] you're about to do amen but i know that
[51:24] you're about you're about to do this but
[51:26] yet in him doing that judas knowing amen
[51:30] that he jesus knew he still went out and
[51:32] did what he did
[51:34] amen what a great iniquity in this hour
[51:36] not the the the people of this day amen
[51:39] you can present the word to them you can
[51:41] present truth to them
[51:42] but they'll still want to go out and do
[51:44] what they what it
[51:46] whatever is in their heart
[51:48] and there's nothing that you can do
[51:49] about it
[51:50] not even jesus could stop say
[51:53] judas amen from doing what he was
[51:55] supposed to do
[51:56] so it turned now from what satan had put
[51:59] in his heart in verse two where we read
[52:01] the devil having now put into the heart
[52:02] of judas iscariot
[52:04] to now satan entering into judas
[52:08] right that was just full-blown iniquity
[52:10] now
[52:11] amen
[52:14] praise god
[52:16] jesus didn't make a fuss about it or
[52:17] didn't try to even stop judas why
[52:20] because remember
[52:22] it was so that the scriptures the word
[52:24] could be fulfilled
[52:26] like he said in in verse
[52:28] 18 he said i speak not of you all i know
[52:31] whom i have chosen but that the
[52:33] scripture may be fulfilled
[52:36] he that eateth bread with me hath lifted
[52:39] up his heel against me
[52:41] amen
[52:43] so that the scripture can be fulfilled
[52:45] so
[52:46] saints i say this because we we
[52:49] you know we've been seeing people
[52:50] falling away for the past several years
[52:52] now
[52:53] more than likely we'll see even more
[52:55] fallen away you're still going to see
[52:57] surprises you're still going to have
[53:00] don't
[53:02] always keep in mind so that the
[53:04] scripture can be fulfilled
[53:07] the scripture that we read in first
[53:08] timothy there amen that there will be a
[53:10] great fallen away in the end
[53:13] that has to be fulfilled
[53:15] amen that scripture has to be fulfilled
[53:18] and therefore people are fulfilling that
[53:20] scripture
[53:21] unknowingly
[53:23] but that is what's happening
[53:25] amen
[53:27] verse 28 i'm i'm almost done
[53:30] verse 28 now no man at the table
[53:34] knew for what intent he spake this unto
[53:37] him
[53:38] so none of the disciples understood why
[53:41] jesus told him go do what you need to do
[53:43] quickly and do it quickly they didn't
[53:45] understand
[53:46] here jesus is telling them the one that
[53:48] i give the sop to that's the one that
[53:50] will betray me
[53:52] they were so so
[53:54] it was they didn't even have in their
[53:57] thoughts that it would be judas
[54:00] that
[54:01] they could they could not see that for
[54:03] themselves
[54:05] he clear jesus clearly let them all know
[54:07] who would betray him yet not one of the
[54:10] tables was still getting it
[54:15] verse 29 it says
[54:17] for some of them thought some of the
[54:18] disciples stopped because judas had the
[54:20] bag
[54:22] or in other words he kept the finances
[54:24] that jesus had said unto him by those
[54:26] things that we have need of against the
[54:28] feast
[54:29] or that he should give something to the
[54:31] poor
[54:32] and in verse 30 he then having received
[54:35] the sob
[54:36] judas having received this up
[54:38] went immediately out
[54:41] and it was night
[54:43] amen
[54:46] one of the characteristics that you will
[54:47] notice of people that leave this word
[54:50] is that when you expose them
[54:53] they don't want to be around you
[54:56] when you expose that
[54:59] you know they
[55:00] oh
[55:00] you know they get scared
[55:02] amen it was so in in brother brown's
[55:05] ministry amen when he would pray for the
[55:06] sick amen and satan was being exposed
[55:09] brother brown would say that that the
[55:11] people's uh face reactions would change
[55:14] amen when satan is being exposed amen
[55:18] people people don't want to be around
[55:19] with the word where they don't want to
[55:21] be around the word when they're when
[55:23] their life is being exposed
[55:26] sometimes we'll see it here here in
[55:28] church amen when spirits are being
[55:30] exposed and satan is being exposed in
[55:32] people's life
[55:34] you'll see you know they'll you know
[55:38] some
[55:39] something changed
[55:41] and something
[55:42] satan doesn't like to be exposed that's
[55:45] why
[55:46] brother branham said that he hates the
[55:48] book of genesis and the book of
[55:49] revelation
[55:51] because he's being exposed in both of
[55:53] them
[55:54] he hates those two books and he'll
[55:55] attack them
[55:57] it's the same thing today amen when you
[55:59] attack or come against that spirit just
[56:01] as jesus
[56:03] attacked the spirit that was controlling
[56:05] that was controlling judas there amen
[56:08] what did you just do he immediately left
[56:12] he immediately went out
[56:14] and it says there that it was night and
[56:16] that's what's happening is our day
[56:18] it's the evening time
[56:20] amen it's night time and people are
[56:22] showing their true colors
[56:24] now i i say the saints because i'm
[56:27] trying to uh i'm gonna i'm gonna leave
[56:29] it right here but
[56:32] in the in the next several verses
[56:35] jesus completely now changes his his oh
[56:39] his
[56:40] of what he tells him now
[56:44] to something totally different now more
[56:45] personal now that judas is out
[56:49] and
[56:50] you can read i encourage you all to read
[56:52] john chapter 13 at home but we'll
[56:54] continue it next time but let me finish
[56:56] with these with these quotes brother
[56:58] branham brother branham says here
[57:00] in modern events made are made clear by
[57:02] prophecy in 1965
[57:04] he says and you know that same things
[57:07] promised in this last days as janice and
[57:10] jamris as james and janus withstood
[57:12] moses so will these men of reprobate
[57:14] mind concerning the truth
[57:17] concerning the truth
[57:18] and when an organization keeps takes a
[57:21] man right down through that organization
[57:23] it showed it did not come from god
[57:25] because god
[57:27] does those things to attract the
[57:29] people's mind
[57:31] and then the message follows it
[57:34] that's what happened in jesus ministry
[57:36] he he he did the miracles gave the
[57:39] loaves and the fishes amen and after
[57:42] that attracted the people but watch when
[57:44] the word comes and the
[57:47] the the message is preached the word of
[57:49] god is preached that is what's going to
[57:51] show people's true colors
[57:53] a lot of them left
[57:55] they couldn't accept the same thing in
[57:57] the ministry of brother branham in this
[57:58] day amen people were flocked amen
[58:01] stadiums to go see people get healed
[58:03] maybe themselves get healed as well
[58:06] but when the word of god was preached
[58:08] and brother branham started laying out
[58:10] the word of god amen the doctrines of
[58:12] the word they couldn't receive that it
[58:15] was hard for the people to receive it
[58:17] god does those things to attract the
[58:18] people's mind and then the message
[58:20] follows it if it isn't then it's not god
[58:24] it's not god god always does that
[58:27] brother brown says
[58:29] judas couldn't understand it he walked
[58:31] right with him he didn't see it
[58:37] but i mean i mean the people today amen
[58:40] that have walked in this message uh
[58:42] supposedly walked in this message i mean
[58:44] you just you thought that they had
[58:46] revelation and they preached some
[58:48] amazing things
[58:51] and yet walk out and leave the word
[58:54] take down the cloud and
[58:56] all these things amen what
[58:58] where is the revelation in that
[59:01] it was only just something mentally
[59:04] an experience that they may have had
[59:06] but never
[59:08] it went down into their heart never an
[59:09] ex a true experience with the word but
[59:12] the real watch but the real ordained of
[59:14] god that real gene
[59:16] that real germ a soul of god that was in
[59:20] god before the foundation of the world
[59:22] remember you that's really got the
[59:24] spirit of god in you tonight you were
[59:27] here in christ because he was the
[59:29] fullness of the word he was the fullness
[59:31] of the godhead bodily god was in christ
[59:33] reconciling the world to himself do you
[59:36] believe that
[59:37] amen and in the church age book
[59:41] brother brown says now i am sure
[59:44] that you have noticed that those whose
[59:46] names were in the book of life
[59:49] well it's not the lamb's book of life
[59:50] but the book of life were a part of the
[59:53] religious order of that day
[59:55] that centered around the true god and
[59:58] worship of him
[1:00:01] though they did not worship according to
[1:00:04] truth word
[1:00:06] like judas they didn't go all the way
[1:00:10] see how judas was chosen of god
[1:00:13] he was instructed in truth
[1:00:17] you can't say that these people did not
[1:00:19] have truth they had truth
[1:00:22] they just didn't continue in that truth
[1:00:25] he shared knowledge of the mysteries he
[1:00:27] had a ministry of power granted unto him
[1:00:30] and he healed the sick and cast out
[1:00:33] devils in jesus name but when the
[1:00:35] showdown came
[1:00:37] he sold out for gold and political power
[1:00:41] he did not go up to pentecost to receive
[1:00:43] the spirit of god
[1:00:45] he was devoid of the spirit
[1:00:50] make me watch what brother brown says
[1:00:52] here make no mistake about it a person
[1:00:54] that is truly baptized by the holy ghost
[1:00:58] into the body of christ not just
[1:01:00] baptized amen on the flesh
[1:01:03] but watch by the holy ghost into the
[1:01:06] body of christ
[1:01:07] receiving the fullness of the spirit
[1:01:10] will be in the word
[1:01:12] all the way
[1:01:15] we'll be in the word all the way
[1:01:18] that is the evidence of being baptized
[1:01:20] with the holy ghost
[1:01:23] failed
[1:01:25] multitudes fail right there
[1:01:28] and when they fail to go on in that word
[1:01:31] their names are taken off
[1:01:34] the book of life
[1:01:36] now i didn't say it brother branham was
[1:01:37] the one that said it
[1:01:39] and the word of god says
[1:01:41] amen
[1:01:42] the true bride of christ in this hour
[1:01:44] amen will continue with all the word
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:50] and
[1:01:51] none of these scarecrows amen will scare
[1:01:53] will scare her
[1:01:55] oh my goodness are you not 80 of the
[1:01:58] people left the message that doesn't
[1:02:00] scare me
[1:02:01] and it shouldn't scare you amen if
[1:02:03] you're truly baptized into the body by
[1:02:06] the holy spirit amen that amen it
[1:02:09] didn't scare jesus it didn't scared uh
[1:02:11] what he was going to do he knew where he
[1:02:13] stood that judas was going to do what he
[1:02:16] was going to do he just moved on and
[1:02:18] just let him do what he was needed to do
[1:02:20] let these people do what they need to do
[1:02:23] because why the scripture must needs
[1:02:25] fulfilled amen
[1:02:27] now hopefully next next time
[1:02:30] we'll continue with this but we'll talk
[1:02:32] about we'll we'll intertwine it now with
[1:02:35] with the commandment amen of what
[1:02:37] of the lord
[1:02:38] and uh of what jesus was speaking there
[1:02:41] in uh
[1:02:43] i forgot the title of our message here
[1:02:46] the law of christ amen in order to
[1:02:49] advance the kingdom of god
[1:02:51] praise the lord you love him
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:55] let's just
[1:02:56] let's just sing that song real quick i
[1:02:58] love him i love him because he first
[1:03:00] loved me let's just stand to our feet
[1:03:02] hope trust that you receive something i
[1:03:04] mean i encourage you all to to to just
[1:03:06] look into this yourself amen
[1:03:08] look look into it yourself let let god
[1:03:10] reveal
[1:03:11] this to you and and and and see how this
[1:03:15] so parallels with what's going on in our
[1:03:17] day
[1:03:18] and because it was in the word already
[1:03:20] it should not take us by surprise
[1:03:22] although it does
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:25] and unfortunately we're here
[1:03:27] amen but the
[1:03:29] god said in his word that he will have a
[1:03:31] bride without spot
[1:03:33] or wrinkle
[1:03:34] amen and i believe that with all my
[1:03:36] heart let that be you amen
