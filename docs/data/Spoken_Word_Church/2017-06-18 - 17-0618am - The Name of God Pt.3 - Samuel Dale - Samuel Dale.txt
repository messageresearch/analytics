»     30     †     I and my Father are one.

EPHESIANS 3:14-16
»     14     †      ¶  For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
»     15     †     Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 
»     16     †     That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;


1) REVELATION 3:1
»     1     †      ¶  And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.

REVELATION 3:8
»     8     †     I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

«  117       †        But remember, at the going out of this... Don't confuse it, for when they received these names here of these denominations, they would die right in them same things, right on down. But He said, just between the Methodist and Pentecostals going out, "I have set a open door before you." There you are, the Name restored again. "I have set an open door, but I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No man cometh to the Father except through Me." What is it? That open door.

He's walking around, the same great God, the same great signs were to take place all down through these ages because He walked among each age. Blessing what? His people that's assembled in His Name.
    I want you to watch in this as we go through the church. This church had Jesus' Name. This church had Jesus' Name. This church had Jesus' Name. And this church lost It. This church come out, the Luth...

hey don't we thank God for people who can stay that long and be you know be real good okay John 10 and verse 30 alright let's just the very familiar scripture with all of us and all and remember to sister Monica and sister Anna's classes will be practicing at 12:50 today between the services and also just bring them all up here okay very familiar Scripture and look what Jesus said he said I and my father are one it's as simple as any language could be it doesn't have to be interpreted it doesn't have to be explained it has to be believed because that's what he said alright let's go to Ephesians now and we'll go to 3 verse 14 accent excuse me I better get my scriptures right I better get Exodus myself I've had it well I've got mine written Ephesians I want to read these it okay we'll read Exodus later on I said I've got mine of Ephesians and I wanted to read that those are the thoughts and things that we're in cohesion 3:14 says for this cause I by my knees under the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth his name and he would grant to you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man the whole family all the way brings it to the inner man you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we have been placed to services we've been talking on a very familiar thought with all of us but as I just wanted you to keep in mind and think about the things and I've asked the question over and over in this series part we're talking and we're talking about the name of God the name of God now Jesus said during the scriptures in John he said I come in my father's name well you know if you go in your father's name a son always go or children always go in the name of the Father now then that way my my children are not is always saying oh come back here by that name but always say that my kids are not McGillicuddy's it's just a name I use see they are Dales because they come in my name all right and see Jesus when he said I come in my father's name he wouldn't talk in about a second person we don't believe that we believe in one true and living God all right we don't believe in God in three persons we've been through that through the the errors of time and brought it out and we believe the Word of God to be true and even the first commandment is would break up the Trinity where it says you know that there's just one God all right now we tried to be you know all the way through and talking about the things in the scriptures about the name of God and seeing like I said you'd say to most people you say what's the name of God it's God it was God well they even make a God out of anytime because not to just say his name is God God simply means an object of worship alright we've been through the Old Testament we came up to our Wednesday bringing it up to the part of of Jesus Christ when he was born on earth as a child and see they named him Jesus but what didn't they call him as the Bible had said in Isaiah that you'll call his name Emmanuel but they didn't call him Emmanuel they called him Jesus why because Gabriel told Mary to call his name Jesus because he saved his people from their sins alright we've been through the mini title see god is just a title oh you know you want to check for a million dollars I'll write it out and sign it garden you want to go to the bank with it wouldn't work too good with it that's not jokes that's not things that say anything wrong this truth thing because that word God is just meaning an object of worship it's a title just like in the Old Testament when you start out in Genesis it starts talking about God and that's derived from the word Elohim which means self exist one all right now see that's not his name it's not it's not L ahem you got people today you know that that say the name of God is Yahweh you've got this group believing this way that way all of those Yahweh Jehovah l ahem all of those are titles and they have connection to Almighty God because that's where to develop from because when they said when they looked at what they were trying to define to bring into being into the English language and things they would look and they'd see wordings and and they try to translate or translator doesn't translate by revelation he's not supposed to do that he doesn't he's not supposed to put his thoughts into it he's supposed to translate by literal words and telling you what that word is okay and that's where he translates so then Jehovah means like a father with his family but that's not a that's not his name you say an Old Testament they called him Jehovah yeah but we gave you the scriptures our worries were God Himself said by my my my name Jehovah was I never known C then you say well yeah he was called this out of the others right but they couldn't pronounce that word it's jva too they couldn't pronounce it so they've done the best they could do and it made it Jehovah but that's not the correct understanding all right now so we went through the many many things of you can call him I am you can call him Rose of Sharon Lillie the valley bright and morning star Alpha Omega beginning in father son Holy Ghost all of that is titled to a name right you you know like me I I was a General Motors employee that's one title no all right then I'm a pastor that's another title and I'm a father that's another time but that's not my name me that that won't connect see but then when you say same you'll say wait a minute that's mana then I know my knife come on and see then in the Bible as they were trying to translate it down they brought it down to the name of Jesus right because really they didn't translate it now listen what I'm saying the scholars never translated it to come out to Jesus the angel Gabriel told him what to call him the scholars translated it to come to Emmanuelle right but see when it was finished it couldn't be Manuel so they understood Emmanuel you know was not his name but his name is Jesus so much self-awareness that's what I want you to think simple his name is Jesus it's always been his night that wasn't used in the Old Testament under the form of Jesus written in your scriptures it would use the titles of I am Jehovah and all like that but remember what we were trying to get at see there's no salvation in to say the name of Jehovah there's no salvation and to say hello him the salvation comes in the name of Jesus Christ because the Bible says that there's none other name given under heaven we're bided it we're to be saved but under the name of Jesus all right so Jesus is the very name of God now we're not oneness our Jesus only but they had their places back at the turn of the century we'll get to it a little bit they begin to develop into what they would call the Jesus only people you know are the oneness and they had truth because the name was coming back into understanding of the name of Jesus and what it meant but they didn't just say well okay his name is yet you know we just ride it out Jesus I was showing my wife a little point dark that you're to look some of the wording sometimes and I showed it curve of an emphatic die Glocke two different ways of spelling the name of Jesus and there's only a few verses apart we get it's the name Jesus all right see there like I've always tried to tell you when you see things in the Bible in Genesis it says God created God created God created the Genesis - or did it say Lord God reach the Bible it just it just goes up to the Lord God why because something else was coming into view but is there can be no salvation entitles you guys where you Catholic Church tried to put it father son Holy Ghost back in the dark ages and that won't work there's no salvation in titles I don't care what title you call him there's no salvation there's only salvation in the name of Jesus Christ alright see then that way we can know for sure D where our truth is that in the word to find the name of Jesus right and see that what that means to us we read there and everything in heaven everything in earth is named Jesus then we know everything's not named Jesus what's otama he's talking about God and his offspring we claim to be the children of God cry by the new birth you and I are sons and daughters of a living God right so what is your father's none and remember Jesus at the resurrection remember - resurrection was appearing to Mary and what did he say he said I go to my god and your God he said I go to my father and your father Richard I'm here alright so now then if we are their children of God then and then we would call it from the Bible terminologies the Bride of Christ his wife wife takes on the name right I mean my wife maiden name was cash well uh don't ask me ever to do a wedding to wear that you women would keep your maiden name I won't do it I don't care what you're saying I'm not going to do it because you're not supposed to go that way you're supposed to relinquish your name and take the name of the husband right and see as the children of God then our father's name is Jesus when you say we but but that's that's this - no that's not - simple less or true his name is Jesus within you are missus because you're taking on the name of your husband and as the children of God we take it on the name of our Father so our father's name is Jesus that's the only name that God ever had everything else is titled everything else's means is there means a door got a meaning to it with the name of Jesus and I've been trying to make a simple point to you know title so I am Yahweh anything no title can contain the entire meaning of God no title cam are you listening with the name of Jesus is the entire full meaning of Almighty God so it takes all of those titles that's why I came through the Old Testament it took four thousand years to bring forth Christ upon the earth you know not if they didn't pronounce through the word Jesus back there is get the point the point is that Jesus Christ is our Savior right the Flex man was not in the Old Testament we got this little sentence you know he was not back guarding flags but he was back there to show many titles and many references pointing down within one day God didn't even choose a prophet to bring tonight yet he did to their convenience a Jehovah he was trying to say the name Jesus when he said an angel Gabriel straight from glory to deliver to Mary the name to call the baby alright then we went to that even when it when he went over when Mary went to Elizabeth and Elizabeth was pregnant about six months with Little John learn but he hadn't moved your mama said but when the name of Jesus was proclaimed he leaked in his mother's womb it's not just j esus you know there's plenty of Jesus's in the world today but there's only one Lord Jesus Christ there's many people can say my name is Jesus but we don't worship them because there's one Lord Jesus Christ the Bible said in his name one sitting all of the titles that's what I've been getting to you look at you take all of those titles that you can bring up and when you do all of them put together equals out to Jesus because that's the only name God ever had show me another night you said well Yahweh's don't know go back and find out where it come from those things were titled to a nine just like Jehovah just like Elohim just like only it was titles to a name but it wasn't the name I have many titles but my name is Samuel and season by being a Dale I came in my father's name Dale did what we should think about is looking at Jesus Christ to see who he really is that has God real to you or is he just a spirit I know the Bible or the 5:24 God is a spirit John 5:20 they the worst we must worship in spirit and truth as truly know God's real cause not justice thoughts of your imagination that's all of these other of philosophies bill Indian he worshipped the moon the stars and the thing and he would get down and pray until he would feel uh 19 all religions dealing that way right some spiritual anointing and he would be contacting what he thought with God but see you don't have to get down and pray come on ain't doing away with prayer I'm trying to put it in right place listen you don't have to get down and pray to be able to contact God why don't you just open up your heart and talk to it yeah but I got to get this away I got to pray over here I got to get on my knees I got to do that where's that in the Bible yeah somebody about ready to whack your head off you ain't got time to ask him let you pray you better start believin right so what is Pryor that's the point I've been emphasizing prayer is a contact you know say between you and God but do you have to pray out loud for him to hear you he hears the very whispers and thoughts of your heart the Bible says pray without ceasing write the scripture oh you don't want to do that but you know the monks setting upon him healed roles are they get in there and they pray all day long there's one they get up and go down and pray all day long now that would be praying without ceasing but you can't do that right we got to make a living we got to work we got a little got to do so what does it mean to pray without ceasing keep the right mental attitude in your thoughts and you can talk to God all day long and nobody hears it but you ain't God because he knows our very intensive our heart he knows the reason why we're praying there certainly but it's like I've asked you before why is it that we can call Jesus one time we can pray and seemingly even maybe get anointed and feel good about and it not come to pass then sometimes you're just walking alone and something that seems to contact you and speak to you except IQ Jesus you know what you go find out what you've been asking for takes place my point is could it be not just trying to find letters on the page to be able to pronounce the name but to find out that that name is the name of a person is your god real as read just the thoughts of your mind remember what I said about the Indians he worships he feels the spirit he puts some kind of a name to his god and Infeld times but is that all we want to do and I'm kind of like the old feller said that time you know when they talk about all this praying the Catholics want you to come pray to the Virgin Mary and she prays for you or pray to this me for you I'm not going off on them I'm just making a point I like what the old man said it was in trouble he said when I'm in trouble I don't have to go through no secretary that I want to talk to the head man you know I don't have to go through somebody else all right so what are we talking about the name of Jesus you can call that name Jesus what about an axe you remember what the guys they they decided that they were going to seven of them were sons of school isn't running seven of them they decided but they were going to go down because they seen Paul and then singing praying and they've seen things take place and they could hear him praying in the name of Jesus and the new thing and they decided that go pray not remember the scripture and said we're dirty or the demons you know in the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches I said you had it lined up with a name and you had a good representation to go with it as to what Paul preaches but you know what happened to them the demons jumped on them and tore them up so it's not to just say Jesus but to know who you're praying to it's been the whole point I've tried to make is to know who you praying to do you know him as your personal Savior or you just know what somebody else told you about him or somebody else told you you got to do this somebody else said you got to repent somebody else says you got to be baptized somebody else says you got to do this or have you experienced that because only by personal experience see Paul had a personal experience of Jesus Christ right those sons of scuba they were just going by what they thought he said so they were saying what somebody else said remember that don't work it's a personal revelation they asked him there in the book of Acts you know whose unit the other day where they said how did this man wind up he'll they said through faith not just the name says the name and faith in the name that made this mental whole not just the name and not to just say some faith or thought they put a name with it see jesus said ask anything in my name and I'll give it to you you saying I know you if you'll just think truthfully you prayed and pray and you thought you contacted God you got feelings you got emotions you got things that we believe in all of that God is in the Bible but somehow it just didn't seem to work within a time happens if something just happens in this you just receive a knowledge it read it anyway you've been healed by confessing God's Word but that's what we're supposed to do we're supposed to keep confession it but confess that he's already healed us not confessed for him to healers confess that he's already healed us thank him for it because you're reminding him of what he says in his word you know you know God I don't think God gets upset because we remind him what he said I think he's glad of that I think he said well my children or just like me remember God takes his own word he's got to believe his own word to be right he said conda believes on what he does don't he we see that's what I'm trying to get at are we trying to find letters on a page they would spell out Jehovah some way that they could finally derive now to get that jvh you and they could derive it and bring it out and make it at some kind of a great name they said we got the name of God well they just wasted time but the Bible said to call his name Jesus we're not taking from that order of what you're thinking about and think about is he a person to you I know a silly things and I'm like points and whole but I try that's my wife yesterday I said you called up wait on the telephone and wait answers do you think you're talking to terrorize No I know it's not care us if I hear the voice and it wasn't care us a call you know what I mean is it right he said what are you getting now do you know its name enough to know who the person is remember if he's got a name now here's our point listen if he's got a name he's a person spirits and things like those things is not they don't have names it takes something that God created the Angels but then when he did he moved them in and some wound up with names why because they wound up being closer to what they are but what about a name now you call somebody on the phone let them say you call somebody on the telephone and you say okay you know it's very hard for me to disguise my voice I call most everything you say brother Dale you don't who is it you don't do like that you know who it is why because you've heard my voice so long until it's part of your thinking well not really not listen to what I'm getting at sorry I just try to make something simple I know it I confuse and make a good still I try you realize that in your mind's eye view if I call wait on the phone he answer the phone you know now in modern science we got now here we look at each other we used to life about that about 40 years ago 50 years ago you know you talk about that some of your older ones remember you remember what you said so you can't answer the phone you put your clothes on all right that's what we all liked about code it's true you see the people well what if I died Wade and Terence appeared on the screen not right it's not the person I want to talk to why don't you think about Jesus Christ as being real well he's just a spirit now we follow our prophets message I know the brother I know his face but I can't woman El Salvador we believe God sent a prophet to us in the last day and I got him laying here if anybody wants some see God is a being he's not just to say I spook from floating around that's the old Indian talking to the things huh I'm not going up on the old Indian because he remember them all Indians we're doing pretty good you know that Geronimo probably the reason they could never capture little boy Geronimo saw visions because he entered the spirit world see he could do those things my being as he words why they call him the shaman the guy they were what they called him for the Indian medicine man but listen he said what are you getting at I'm getting to one point when you're praying do you ever think about who you're praying to I mean really do your seriously ever think about who you're praying to but I just pray to the Father I pray this what I'm sorry I know problem but if these are being not like the wind remember probably explaining God is not even listen we called him omnipresent we try to make it do it you know that God is not omnipresent it's Excel for the fact that he's omniscient because he's a beating now wait a minute you're trying to limit in some I'm not limiting something I'm telling the truth God is a being you not like the wind is blowing about he wasn't that before the world ever begun he wasn't that before time ever begun I'm just some floating spirit if we get into all these movies and things and we try to think things out they do and they got these kind of something neat this here is supposed to be their sit no God is real he's real he's a person he's the only person he's not the first person to the second person or third person he's not nothing he is the person he's Almighty God himself made manifest in flesh is that what your scripture says God took upon form as we said we got to the baby talking about Jesus God took on a form of a human being and in soul that man we look at better that little baby we look at you remember we ended up the other day talking about Jehovah crying in the cradle it's over with no teeth Jehovah play in why can't you take that way it happened your whole is a car burger making a living why can't we think of it that way call this real they bring them the vorc real to you and not just some spirit that you well he has no form he's just floating around everywhere you think you're reeling it's like he's not real you mean this wood is more real or more tangible or what the words is for it then Almighty God who made the tree so what you don't believe God can just be a spirit and he can appear to you yeah you can talk to you can do but he's also real don't you try talking to him sometime why don't you think about your priorities a contact between you and Almighty God is he ever that real to you you ever felt his presence to work you knew that they were just a presence with you never done that that's wonderful didn't it it's marvelous but what if he walked right out in front of me you say you can't do it he's done it what about when brother brother saw Jesus out in the field of their Jefferson be standing up in there I like the way he says it he said Hoffman's head of Christ is the closest and he didn't say it look just like him listen what he said he said it's the closest of anything man has ever painted of Jesus Christ you know what he saw him he saw him you going to take his word for it that he saw him why not you take his word on everything else I can't you believe that but you see people who have never experienced supernatural things to know is hard for them to believe understand that you got one person that is seen times the other person has never seen it like that it's hard to get that person that hasn't seen it to understand what you saw but why can't you disbelieve simplicity that God is real do we talk about one true and living God but do we believe in one true and living God Jesus said if you see me recording Trisha he said you've seen my father he said because my father and I are one and he said if you same name you've seen the father well what's your father look like you know think my god what does the father looked like when on Jesus he was six foot tall and he was nestling and the father was a fat old ground food now that's not what he said he said if you've seen me he said you've seen the father he said why do you ask to see me said if you've seen me in seeing the father but his name is Jesus when he how trouble calling his name Jesus he said everything to ask he said everything you do in word and deed do all in the name of Jesus Christ but now listen I tried to state it I made it over and over and I want you to think cold fish I say Jesus your mind automatically Falls to a human flesh you said well when did Jesus coming to me it'll fall to a baby in a cradle to fall to human being as we call it flash you know I wonder what that man who throwed them three Hebrew children in that fiery furnace and he gets up the next morning he looks down in there and he said didn't we throw three and they said yeah he said war they forward I don't know and watch what he said he said in one of them is likened to the show of God then why would that heathen King say that because one thing for sure if there was something else in learned they wouldn't get burnt up it had to be God right alright and if it was God and he could see it he knew God had to change a form in some way to be able to him to see that he said like unto the Son of God his name is Jesus what about it then God has never had but one name his name is Jesus there's no salvation entitled now listen what I'm saying we you know we come from that at the point we saw where the Catholic Church and improve it you know that they changed the mood or way of baptism from the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the father son Holy Ghost down about six Oh developed fully about six oh six started in 325 right and see they say and keep saying father son holy a lot lately and father son the Father Son and Holy Ghost is simply Lord Jesus Christ that's helpful in simple to us to understand but as the theologian about it you can't think that simple because really see it's got to be revealed to you now letters are the page riding a Jes us there's no revelation to just look at that that's natural human writing when you see who that really is and you know who you're talking to is like I said it a minute ago you call somebody on the phone and you know who you're talking to you know if you know the person in your mind's eye view you can see the person that you're talking to you see what in your mind's eye view not it ain't all mighty telephones now that get door you really see the whole person I'm talking about that you can see by your mind's eye view of who you're talking to and by seeing by your mind's eye view you see the actual person let's die like I said have you ever thought about it so much until that you could bring into mind a picture in your mind of what Jesus Christ looks like you know a lot of them doing that and read a lot of drawings they come out a whole lot and that stuff right you ever seen all the Alaniz hundreds of different drawings of Jesus we none of them fit the thing that brother branham said well I'm just dumb enough to state what he said if he saw Jesus and he looked like Hoffman's or not I like Hoffman's they're back here you know see people will say well why you got two pictures back there look at one of them is young look the other one is old my sins caused that problem so I'm in the middle and that's the reason those pictures had always been there I caused that Tim to look like he did when he got beat my sins Shirley why can't I believe him as being real yes but brother Dale he's never spoke to me if you ever heard him speak yeah but not in your words and Thompson speaking you ever heard him to just tell you something right yeah but see you're making it down that you're bringing him down to worry more tangible seemingly you're trying to make him more that we could move if he is to create or that created us is tangible then he's greater than us is being tangible why wouldn't we think of that when we consider that we know the truth what about the religious world that is in total darkness believe it in a trinity concept and today they're singing and worshipping and say Jesus Jesus we love you we'll go ask them about their doctrine of the Trinity and they'll let you know they don't leave it like that what's their minds I view what jesus looks like you understand what I'm saying why don't we look at it as a person why don't we look at God has a real being a person and then you can begin to visualize more and more that he can have a name that he's not just a spirit floating around that he's real why can't we just put it to that understanding that it's not understanding letters on a page it's understanding that name is that person is that true let me go down to commerce and you say Donnie faught Busch we got all these cells carved up on the other end of town he's kind of a tall guy a little crazy but he's all right you understand what I'm getting at they know him by his name what do you know God by his name instead of just said what I've got to call him Jesus Jesus Jesus I thought we believe that the Bride of Christ was to come into the adoption all stages in the life stage that she could speak in his name I thought we believed are in mark or it says you say to this mountain be moved and go down I thought we believed the Bible but do we believe in it being real and she talked to him like a real person you still remember the story reason I say that I don't make light of nobody I'm not doing nothing the brother Branham in his beginning you know he said he heard people say you pray this way you get down this way you go down that way you go this way he was trying to find some way to contact actress all over with he just hold it down and said Lord just listen to me you know we might change some of our thoughts of our mind if we realize God knows her my I cost more than our literal words that we say right but is your God real I've got about a real God because this is a background part for coming up the Lord willing into some talks we're going our way back again and pick up and come down but what about it why would have the Bible in Revelations three and one talked about in the fifth church age that thou has the name that you're livid but you're dead see they had lost the name of Jesus Christ that's the stove's of human mind now they never lost the name of Jesus to the Trinitarian people called him Jesus they never lost that what did they lose what was lost in the dark ages that the Prophet would call it and say his name was lost in the fifth church age but sitting in the six church age you see it coming back to his name and he said right in between the six church age in the seventh he said the name of Jesus you go back and check your history and between those two parts you got your oneness people coming back in right at the turn of the century and you got your Jesus only people that was a move of God for that day but we don't want to believe that that's just like believing the name of God in Jesus we don't want to believe that that Martin Luther and Lutheran Church started out with a man that was led of God and the whole world was waiting on Luther to proclaim the judge you live by faith and God took that invasive and converted the world we don't want to believe it can we looking back at them as Luther and they are not doing everything in the world I do at home what is that making it ever done any guys that started it where did you not come from but think about it this sign of good living point and we'll quit he's in that name of Jesus being restored the Bible calls it during revelation open door an open door between the six churches in the seventh there's a door open which was the revelation of his name now in the ages did they as I always emphasize it you know or try to you say the name was lost did they call him Jim Joe or Charlie no they called him Jesus but they lost the revelation of who he was and what he was and they called him the third person of the Trinity right they lost the revelation of supreme deity it didn't change the letters on the page they called him Jesus but mankind had so perverted it until a real true meaning of God in his church it went so far away until the Bible writes it up is saying we got to open the door because they've done forgot all about me the revelation of God supreme deity of who he was not access to regards see that was what was lost the word the word was lost through the ages and they wouldn't allow the people to read it they forbid mankind to read it and then write in Latin and speaking Latin honey only Tomic spoken English when it told you what you had to do no joke I screwed right they come down to tell you and you were confessing your problems they told you what to do the only time they spoke to him English rest of the time they wanted to keep it Latin because he didn't want you to know anything about God but I keep saying it you're gone renal or just a thoughts from your mind have you ever had an experience with God to where that you're not just saying mama said it daddy said it uncle said it ain't said it or whoever said it you ever just got down to the point of seeing him as being real then you'll see that it wasn't Jes us that was lost in the ages they still called him Jesus but they called him what they had been taught to call him the third person second person and that still be happening right today or is God real to you you called him on the phone you know what I'm talking about and you praying who you praying to are we praying to the Holy Ghost to get him to pray to the Father and to do it all in Jesus name or we prayed to Jesus himself which we know is to be an Almighty God what about it no salvation except in the name of Jesus Christ that name was so marvelous wonderful it takes all now listen set it over and over to you for three services it takes all of them titles any title you could come up with Rosa sure and Lily divided rotten Morningstar Alphin amigo I am Elohim Jehovah Yahweh's anything you wanna go it takes all that put together to be that one name Co Jesus and you agreed well ago when you'd say I come in my father's name and I come in my father's name so that would make all of us as being having one night all the children of God out of the same night what I call you cheating all see you're getting so carnal you're not even listening it's not to call you Jesus that's not what we're talking about out which is to know who we are you realize only a Christian has a right to call the name of Jesus the rest God permits that it allows it and honors it the only of Christian have the right to call his name because he's the only one that's really supposed to know is not and we're talking about Father's Day you remember as kids and you watch your father do things and you do a lot of that now I watch these kids around here and I see them and then I just like cause I look and I'll see them I see you walk a certain way and the way you do and look and see your children doing the same time we call it follow following into father's footprints you know that's good I thought we're supposed to follow into our real father's foot trench the one who saved us the one who gave his life for us now I'm bringing it down to a talk I'll jump a lot of the message would you get to this you believe enough in one true and living God to believe this statement listen to over the old is to Jesus or the new you really believe that what I told it you're holding witness one day I said I'm reward your holy witness and you all you are I see ever caught your holy the old Jesus or the new you just look at him the old man grabbed his arm took into the truck okay you want that boy to ask for more questions but do you really believe you're over the old it's Jesus at the end or did he change somewhere in between now let me ask you this way where you get my point most everybody texts you over the old was a mean old daddy you killed everybody for whatever they'd done and wrote Ten Commandments and all he wanted to do was he lined up and beat you to death to the old guys ride everybody says you're whole you know here there was no love that guy and where did you get that idea it ain't in the Bible you means you're over meaning like a father with his family in the Old Testament you're hobos we call him/her God was a God of hate Jesus is a God of you've got a lot of mercy and grace in the Old Testament the law itself is God in the letter form the Ten Commandments is God if you read it different you wouldn't read it nor so good pillow could read it from a different thing and say I shall not kill is it a god of hatred but yet in the human realm listen even your prophet said one day he said I used to think that God hated me but Jesus loved me he said until I found out they were the same person now how can he be a person of hatred or arrogant lean in the Old Testament and come into the new testament and turn the other cheek and be the God of love you're not in your Bible you can't believe it the way I'm talking about it when I saved you over the old is Jesus of the news nothing changed he just stepped into human flesh but do you really believe that that little baby that was laying in the cradle was Almighty God you really believe that I've had people say well who wrong the world while he was in the womb I said he just spoke it before he went to the womb that took care of it it'll run until it gets through but see that's we think you know what do you really believe well the Bible said God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself Bible said in healing well the fullness of the Godhead bodily you mean when he walked her yes when he walked dark he was Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness of the Godhead bodily he was all of them titles he was all of them Jehovah's and other hymns and fathers sons and Holy Ghost he would all of that his name was Jesus because energy over the old Jesus of the near let's turn it around the Jesus of the old is still a Jehovah today because you know what you over me father with his family he never lost any title I've always tried to get you to look at one time you go back before the world this is what always helped me you go back before the world and you see you talk about him having attributes and he never gained one attribute coming into the world and displayed his attributes he had his attributes for the world well why can't we see it now he never done away with Jehovah he's still a father with his family he never done away with Elohim that means self-existing because he still the self existing God who exists in his people but how about you're probably saying it like this he said that Godhead is not complete without you do you really believe that you really believe it is that Godhead is not complete without you come on why don't you think about what is the Godhead father son holy go son where are the sons and daughters of the Living God but he's not complete without being you what do you really see that you all the old in Jesus within you you know what the Apostle Paul and allow time to read them like I'm laying here you know the Apostle Paul was the only one of the Apostles it knew that I'm quoting brother Brandon all sinned because of the abundance of Revelation LeBron said Paul had more revelation in here the rest of them said because he had the revelation to holy o the cheese's of the new the Apostle Paul had a deeper revelation than any of the Apostles now here's my ending point gotta try to make it if Paul understood that you over the old was Jesus of the new I've got three I think it is laying there whoops then what if Peter believed what did John what it Matthew what did they believe you know what they believe now listen they believe is your over the old with Jesus is the new well you just said they didn't didn't lay that no they believed it in the lower understanding their understanding of God was one crew and living God right repeater in his riding and see he's not a Trinitarian he believed in one true and living God look at John and all of them all just had a deeper revelation that would bring down to the end time Paul believed in the supreme deity john believed in the supreme deity Peter believed in the supreme deity with their revelation was just not the depth of the Apostle Paul come on explain it some other way - Peter didn't believe in another god or didn't believe Jesus was a second person or something like that he believed that that was the same Almighty God that was in the Old Testament but he just didn't believe it is the depth the Apostle Paul you know why you believe the prophet saw Jesus standing in the field of burned Jefferson did not you believe that he said he did it what did Paul see on the road at Damascus what did Paul said now don't go to carnal women he didn't have to see him standing there to look like Hoffman over here that run around him which all here don't make me carnal he saw Jesus go to random What did he say about it no wonder he'd make it he said there was no way that Jim was going to call that pillar of fire Lord he saw him from his mind's eye view maybe not a hoffman's of a picture that run around it was all Jesus I don't have to go anyway he saw him from his mind's eye view and it was so confusing actually these other guys are talking about spiritual binge remember he what I will say just a little bit me left is it they're not talking about the acid yeah I don't say what I saw something real but that's why I called him Lord you know he called him Lord where he got an uber Oh so Jesus he's so so real he believes that you over the old but Jesus isn't it Peter never saw him my revelation i along saw him a revelation that's what I'm getting at asking you and I'm the question have you ever seen God by revelation and you never see God by revelation in his word they'll never talk you out it right sorry folks what about all the people of this message that is left yet they preached Jesus for forty fifty years they never saw Jesus they never saw Jesus like Peter saw Peter showing this Almighty God Paul saw him as a total supreme almighty deity that would tie in and come all the way to this day and the endtime revelation is that you hold the older Jesus or the new with the same revelation Paul and you know that come on musician you see him as who he is then you'll see his name is Jesus you'll see him and know that his name is Jesus then you can talk to him not don't out you don't have to get down and practice your wording to contact God now let me say this and that's plain language do you know what communion means to communicate but you know really what it is you shut your mouth and you listen to God prior is that not there we think priors all of these great words we pour out and we have to tell him out of a prop you ever explained to God what the trouble was now be sensible you know it's true you said Lord you know so I told it so in the end I've done and I done this Lord I don't know he knows more about it you do yes you're trying to explain it to him don't you sometimes set out you hardly said I get up and wonderful two knots up in the mountains I never got out of the bed from 10:30 to 7:15 wonderful rest and that's not one time had to get up that's not out of about six times you know what up right and I asked God they take care of you know what I do a lot of time I just go in there and settle him I just sat down once the Lord you know the troubles you know the problem you know every time just take care of it now you got anything you wanna say to me you know what he might talk to you want to do that but just don't get scared if he does you ask him to he might start talking to me the communication we think is blabbermouth and we're oozing all the words communication is shut your mouth and the lips from the garlic there is a greater prior than all the words you could pray all day and you can stay in that attitude from morning till night and pray without ceasing because you've been an attitude of pride but Stan oh my gosh to 24 in Redbook who is your God and what is his name his name is Jesus that fulfills all the Bible that one night you might have many times the olders open about having he leads away and then he's dead I will watch Oh you know ignite me stay here all
