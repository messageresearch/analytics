[8:02] kind of all speak on the nut and let's
[8:06] go the Lord and in prayer and opened up
[8:08] and we go to very very familiar
[8:11] scripture mark chapter 16 and I entitled
[8:16] this power to cast out all the powers of
[8:18] the enemy because you know we do have
[8:22] the power right but you know either even
[8:29] where brother Branham said the church
[8:31] doesn't need the power said it needs the
[8:34] faith to operate the power and that's
[8:38] what we need we need to have that faith
[8:41] Amen god bless you let's all just bow
[8:43] our heads tonight speak to the Lord our
[8:47] Heavenly Father we thank you another
[8:49] Lord we thank you for just allowing us
[8:51] to be back in your house Lord ins to
[8:53] fill your presence and we just pray that
[8:55] you just come tonight lord help us get
[8:57] out of the way or just speak to each
[9:00] heart in each life Lord you know Lord
[9:03] what we have need of
[9:05] Lourdes it's not what what I have in my
[9:08] notes or whatever but Lord you just come
[9:11] and speak to just be a yielded vessel
[9:14] Lord Jesus just open Lord just just like
[9:18] a microphone or Lord as brother I'm sent
[9:21] home at a microphone Lord there has to
[9:24] be someone to come and speak Lord
[9:26] because it's totally mute and what we
[9:29] just pregnant that you come speak Lord
[9:32] help us just get out of the way Lord
[9:34] anoint the ears to hear Lord Jesus Lord
[9:39] I've done all that I can do I know the
[9:44] people have done all that they can do
[9:45] Lord but it takes you now to come put it
[9:48] all together now Lord we just commit it
[9:50] all to you the Lord for each need that's
[9:53] represented tonight Lord each hand Lord
[9:55] each spoken request Lord you know the
[9:58] need and all we just pray that you come
[10:00] on the scene
[10:01] and Lord just bless the bride around the
[10:03] world and what we just commit all these
[10:06] things to you in the name of Jesus
[10:08] Christ amen amen
[10:10] mark 16 and verse and verse 14 says
[10:18] afterward he appeared unto the eleven as
[10:20] they said it meeting them braided them
[10:21] with with their unbelief and hardness of
[10:26] heart because they believed not them
[10:27] which had hurt has seen him after he was
[10:31] risen and he said unto them go ye and
[10:33] all the world and preach the gospel to
[10:35] every creature he that believeth in his
[10:36] baptized shall be saved but he that
[10:38] believeth not shall be damned and these
[10:40] signs shall follow them that believe in
[10:42] my name shall they cast out Devils they
[10:44] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[10:46] take up serpents and if they drink any
[10:48] deadly thing it shall not hurt hurt them
[10:52] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[10:54] they shall recover so then after the
[10:56] Lord had spoken unto them he was
[10:59] received up into heaven and set on the
[11:01] right hand of God and then we'll go to
[11:04] chapter Luke chapter 10 verse 19 and
[11:08] Jesus says behold I give unto you power
[11:11] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[11:14] over all the power of the enemy nothing
[11:16] shall by
[11:18] means hurt you hey man god bless you
[11:21] tonight and be seated I feel like for
[11:32] like I've been in a whirlwind
[11:33] you know that's wait go them sometimes
[11:37] the life of a Christian you know we
[11:39] don't understand why things happen the
[11:41] way they do but the Bible tells us that
[11:44] all things work together for the good to
[11:46] them that love the Lord who are the
[11:48] called according to his purpose so we
[11:50] don't understand the purpose behind
[11:52] everything but you know what it all
[11:54] works out in the end and so you know I
[11:58] lost my laptop and so it's been really
[12:02] been real fun to try to study and they
[12:05] also stole my SD card out of my tablet
[12:07] they didn't steal the tablet but they
[12:09] stole the SD card out of it hey they
[12:16] they they like I said they open to
[12:20] console the truck they moved the tablet
[12:23] yeah they had to open that they had to
[12:26] open the case to pull the slide the
[12:27] slide the tablet out to get the card out
[12:30] left the pistol in the floorboard but
[12:36] generally took all that I thought you
[12:37] know so interesting I had all those
[12:39] sermons that are on that SD card and
[12:40] they took it had the laptops got all the
[12:43] messages everything and they took it but
[12:44] they left other stuff well maybe that's
[12:47] what that's what we said the other day
[12:48] maybe they'll get saved me tapes
[12:50] maybe somebody somewhere maybe there's a
[12:53] lot out there maybe the words come to
[12:54] somebody you know there's like that like
[12:59] that man overseas he found half of
[13:02] message book the bottom half of the
[13:04] message book because somebody used the
[13:06] other half and the bottom half of it had
[13:09] voice of God's address on and he wrote
[13:11] cuz he could only read half the book but
[13:13] the half that he had was just so amazing
[13:16] what brother branham said that bottom
[13:17] half of that book that he had to write
[13:18] to voice of God seeking so he could get
[13:21] some more word because that just stirred
[13:23] him up comes a half hadn't been told me
[13:26] he got it got enough in the half that
[13:28] that just just three old him just
[13:31] at one house so and tell you what you
[13:34] know and we have when we have you know
[13:37] 1200 sermons you know we ought to we
[13:38] ought to be over joyous and just
[13:41] overfilled because what we have but you
[13:48] you know in the in the beginning brother
[13:54] Brent says this is from the message
[13:58] Queen of Sheba and and brother Branham
[14:00] says I'm talking about the great things
[14:05] he said he says the Bible says in the
[14:10] last days that the angels would turn
[14:12] themselves into ministers of light he
[14:15] said look at the very first sin that was
[14:16] ever performed was Satan wanted a
[14:19] greater a brighter kingdom a great thing
[14:21] and went over in the North and set up
[14:23] his own kingdom to outshine Michael it's
[14:26] always those bright things cuz that was
[14:30] the first one there brother Branham says
[14:32] in Christ the mystery he said the first
[14:35] thing that Lucifer done to separate the
[14:37] fellowship of God and man he wanted to
[14:39] build a United Kingdom a greater
[14:41] splendor and seemingly more culture to
[14:43] greater Kingdom the Michael Christ head
[14:45] I said Lucifer at the beginning his
[14:47] purpose in heart was to achieve a
[14:49] brighter and greater thing in heaven
[14:51] then Christ had is that right by
[14:53] seemingly a more cultured more beautiful
[14:54] more splendor than the kingdom of Christ
[14:57] and you know you know he had he had a
[15:01] perfect place because he was placed by
[15:05] God in the place that he was supposed to
[15:07] be but you know he decided he had to
[15:10] have something greater he thought he
[15:11] could be bigger and they have more than
[15:13] than what what God had given him and
[15:17] that's the reason that he was cast out
[15:18] because he rose up and said you know
[15:21] that I'm gonna make myself higher than
[15:23] God I'm gonna make my kingdom higher and
[15:26] you know murderously a more cultured a
[15:29] greater a bigger a brighter thing than
[15:31] what what God was but you know God with
[15:34] who God is is the God of light and he
[15:36] and there's there's nothing that's ever
[15:37] gonna be great or nothing ever gonna be
[15:39] brighter than God but you know Michael
[15:41] had this or Satan had this great idea
[15:43] what he was going to
[15:45] become bigger but you know in the in the
[15:49] process of him raising up and going
[15:52] against God you know he was cast doubt
[15:54] you know he did not hold this first the
[15:56] state and even Jude tells us about the
[15:58] angels that held not their first estate
[16:00] you know they're they're held until the
[16:02] time to be cast out and there goes you
[16:05] know they're turned over to for
[16:06] damnation but you know there's a time
[16:08] you know those that didn't hold their
[16:10] first estate and you know here they
[16:14] they're they they've raised up to this
[16:16] this to do this great thing but you know
[16:20] Satan did not hold his first place and
[16:22] he was cast down and you know he's never
[16:25] and he never can get back to the place
[16:27] that he was but you know as many times
[16:29] as Satan is went forth he's tried to
[16:32] come back and he's tried to overcome the
[16:34] the work of God and everything and all
[16:37] the way down through history we see that
[16:38] even from the beginning you know because
[16:40] he went from there and then he went into
[16:42] the certain brother I said he went into
[16:44] the serpent and he went to even you know
[16:46] he started trying to get into the human
[16:47] race and you know cause all the problems
[16:49] but you know the thing is the devil
[16:51] thinks he's got something working but
[16:53] the problem is he doesn't know he's
[16:54] right in the hands of God that it's
[16:57] going to be the victory of God that's
[17:00] gonna take places you know so he's
[17:01] already been defeated from the beginning
[17:03] and no matter what he does he's always
[17:05] defeated he'll always be defeated he's
[17:08] never he's never had a victory and every
[17:11] time he thinks he's got something you
[17:12] know because every time that he raises
[17:15] up and he thinks he's got something then
[17:17] you know what he had always miserably
[17:18] fails
[17:19] just like when it when Jesus was in the
[17:21] tomb you know there on the cross he
[17:23] thought you know here here he is that's
[17:24] the man that he claims to be the Son of
[17:26] God to be God manifested in flesh in
[17:29] areas and you know now I'm going to have
[17:31] him right where I want him he's going to
[17:32] be in the grave now and that you know
[17:34] he's not going to raise any more and you
[17:36] know he'll just pass on and then he'll
[17:38] leave me alone and you know I'll have
[17:39] this great victory over him you know
[17:42] he's set there in there and that time
[17:43] and he laid in the tomb but he did not
[17:45] realize that you know that when when
[17:47] Jesus went down there get her then he
[17:48] went and preached to those that were
[17:50] lost in in prison and then he went and
[17:53] went to paradise and he went by and he
[17:55] saw those that had lived
[17:56] I had lived what they had saw all the
[17:59] way down through history there was
[18:01] Abraham and Sarah and Isaac and all the
[18:04] other ones and you know Ezekiel and all
[18:06] the ones there because you know when
[18:07] when he came by Abraham said that's the
[18:11] one that we ain't calf with that we sat
[18:13] under the tree and he was the one that
[18:15] spoke to me and told me when I was in my
[18:17] death that the body was dead I couldn't
[18:19] have children yet he was the one that
[18:21] come and told me that I would have a son
[18:23] that you know when everything looked
[18:25] impossible he was the one that said it's
[18:28] all possible why because if you can
[18:30] believe it'll time to pass you know he
[18:34] didn't even it didn't even you didn't
[18:35] consider you know what what Abraham had
[18:38] to say it was it was a Word of God that
[18:40] was given and you know there was Ezekiel
[18:43] sitting there and speaking he said and
[18:45] there's the will in the middle of the
[18:46] wheel there there he is and benefit
[18:48] station that Hebrew children said there
[18:51] was the one that come walked in the
[18:52] fiery furnace with there he is
[18:54] and you know he come back and he come
[18:56] back and he come up out of the grave and
[18:58] he stood there and you know and he told
[19:00] and he told he told him I said and now I
[19:02] have the keys of death inhale there's a
[19:05] they don't even have keys to his own
[19:07] house he doesn't he's power absolutely
[19:09] powerless why because everything he's
[19:11] tried to do I've taken the power away
[19:13] from him he's absolutely powerless the
[19:16] scripture tells us that every power is
[19:18] permitted of God and so you know and so
[19:21] everything that comes and goes has to be
[19:23] permitted by God to allow so whatever he
[19:26] does he's only allowed to do it because
[19:28] God allows him to do it because he has
[19:31] to work according to the laws of God and
[19:34] you know the thing is is you and I have
[19:36] to work the same way and the only power
[19:38] that Satan ever has is the power that
[19:41] you giving you know we were we've been
[19:44] listening to the seals you know the
[19:46] young people and and you know we were
[19:49] talking about Satan being a bluff you
[19:52] know he's just a bluff you know the
[19:58] Antichrist when tried now with with his
[20:00] bow but you give him the arrows you know
[20:04] he was just a bluff you know Jesus said
[20:08] there in Matthew 24 he said
[20:10] do not be deceived by any means why
[20:12] because you know he's a bluff but he's
[20:14] there to deceive you he's trying to pull
[20:16] a fast one on you but you know he has no
[20:18] power and the Britain that thing is is
[20:21] do you have to believe that we give him
[20:24] the arrows we give them one because the
[20:26] words as we speak are spirit in life and
[20:28] we are the ones that are more armed the
[20:30] devil against us why because it's just
[20:32] like we have to stand fortified behind
[20:34] the word and if we're not fortified
[20:36] behind the word to take every fiery dart
[20:40] of the enemy you know because if we
[20:42] don't that he wins but I'm so glad that
[20:51] I've been given the power you know it
[20:56] doesn't matter what comes my way or what
[20:59] goes because God has made a provision
[21:02] for me you know it you know brother
[21:06] Brennan was talking about and you'll
[21:09] have to forgive me this everything but
[21:12] you know brother Adam was talking about
[21:13] you know what what is the problem with
[21:16] people and what's why don't what is
[21:19] going on because you know God done all
[21:21] that he could and you know when he rose
[21:24] from the dead and then he told the
[21:25] disciples you know here here I'm giving
[21:28] you this power and you know they went
[21:31] out and they they had this this power
[21:34] and you know he you know it's not that
[21:37] you know it just went to Peter and Paul
[21:39] in the 12 and you know the hundred and
[21:41] twenty but you know the power was and
[21:43] the promise was made unto everyone that
[21:45] believes if you believe in the powers
[21:48] under you because because the promises
[21:50] in the Bible are to those that believe
[21:52] whatever God promised is you take him at
[21:56] his word because whatever he promised to
[21:58] one person then he has to fulfill it
[22:00] with everybody if you meet the same
[22:02] conditions if you're on the same
[22:03] qualifications to make the same then
[22:07] then he has to honor his word and so you
[22:10] know if we look back to what the great
[22:12] things that happen in the past and and
[22:14] you know we think of all these different
[22:16] things but you know what it's the same
[22:18] God today but you don't think is you've
[22:20] got to have the same faith to meet
[22:23] at the same requirements on the same
[22:26] ground and he'll do the same thing for
[22:28] you if we can if we can do the same
[22:31] thing you know because you know so many
[22:34] people talk about how wonderful it was
[22:36] way back when but you know what there's
[22:39] a lot of people that wouldn't want to go
[22:40] live back then you know there's so many
[22:44] people that you know they talk about
[22:46] what God had a great move back then well
[22:48] you know life was a lot different back
[22:50] then you know there's a lot of people
[22:54] that you know and my job you know if if
[22:58] the temperature changes to degrees I
[23:00] hear about it you know you can have all
[23:05] kinds of air conditioners running but
[23:07] boy I tell you what if he just gets a
[23:08] little bit or the humidity goes up just
[23:10] a little bit they're calling me I gotta
[23:13] go I gotta go look at it and lots of
[23:15] times there's nothing even wrong with it
[23:17] they're just calling to complain and I
[23:19] go look at it it's like I'm just gonna I
[23:22] just walked through it's like hey I'm
[23:24] looking at the thermostat it's exactly
[23:27] where it's set it's working like it's
[23:29] supposed to be I don't know what the
[23:31] problem is I go on the roof and I look
[23:36] at him I lay hands on the machines and I
[23:37] see air conditions right but people will
[23:42] complain but you know what how many of
[23:45] y'all would like to go back to the days
[23:47] when you know there wasn't anything like
[23:50] that you know there was a time that
[23:52] mister when mr. carrier hadn't even come
[23:55] up with the idea even had the concept of
[23:57] air conditioning hadn't even come up
[23:59] with the idea of refrigeration the only
[24:03] kind of refrigeration that people had
[24:05] was cutting ice off of the lake and
[24:07] storing it up you know there's a lot of
[24:11] things that people we go back and look
[24:13] you know and you know all the way
[24:14] through life all the things that all the
[24:16] comforts that we have now but you know
[24:18] there was a time people didn't have
[24:19] those things you don't think about
[24:22] Susanna Wesley racing 17 children and
[24:25] spending time and praying with each one
[24:27] of them and trying to take care of them
[24:29] they didn't I mean you had to build a
[24:30] fire in the stove to cook food and lots
[24:34] of times they were raising it or you
[24:36] were
[24:36] I'm for it and now everybody you know
[24:43] the first thing to do first thing comes
[24:45] to mind is hey we're just gonna whip
[24:46] through the drive-through everything is
[24:50] instant you know and you know and
[24:55] there's this like brother and said we
[24:56] got more conveniences we've got more
[24:58] modern technology anything and we got
[25:00] less time for God than we ever had why
[25:02] because that's the plan of Satan is is
[25:04] to take up your time with nonsense with
[25:07] things that don't matter but you know
[25:08] people people to spend all their time
[25:10] you know the biggest thing that
[25:12] everybody happens is the first thing is
[25:14] you know they have their phones and it's
[25:17] so funny at work and I know y'all
[25:19] probably never see anything like this
[25:21] before but you go to work and you see
[25:24] people standing in the corners you don't
[25:27] know what that you're working on an
[25:29] assembly line and everything like yet
[25:31] people walk by and they're watching for
[25:33] the bosses and they're going or they go
[25:40] stand over in a corner somewhere and
[25:44] everybody you know and everybody's like
[25:46] hey do you know what happened on the
[25:47] news what happened this that happened
[25:49] that happened you're the first thing
[25:50] everybody's got to tell you about what's
[25:51] going on what scores are everything you
[25:53] know everybody won because everybody has
[25:54] to be fed by that instant gratification
[25:56] because everybody's got to know
[25:58] everything we got to have our pulse on
[26:00] the world everything that's going on in
[26:02] the world you know every time what
[26:04] person bought you know what per this
[26:06] person's wearing or what they where they
[26:08] went and all these different things and
[26:10] everybody's got to know and you know
[26:11] everybody's gonna I got people at work
[26:12] and you know they sitting there checking
[26:15] the stock market they want to know what
[26:16] their what their 401k is doing how much
[26:18] they got they got invested in this and
[26:20] that and they got to know what's going
[26:22] on here and they gotta know what's going
[26:23] on there what's going to take place over
[26:24] in the world you know and it's like well
[26:26] I guess what I'm gonna tell you up front
[26:28] and give you the headlines ahead of time
[26:30] I'll let you see and I'll let you hold
[26:33] it's all gonna get burn up it's all
[26:36] going away so you can put all your faith
[26:39] in all your housing and all your money
[26:40] but there there'll be a day that it
[26:42] won't be worth anything and it won't
[26:45] even exist
[26:46] there'll be well you know you know what
[26:48] there won't be any more cars I don't
[26:49] mean
[26:49] or air-conditioned and there won't be
[26:51] any more lights there won't be any more
[26:52] of those things long because it all be
[26:54] done away with but people spend all
[26:56] their time and you've got to get a stay
[26:58] on top of all this stuff and then you
[27:00] know the everybody's gets wrapped up in
[27:02] entertainment and all these other things
[27:03] and they're just so bound by things that
[27:05] have absolutely no no worth in this
[27:09] world at all I preached one time in Oz
[27:14] that's telling everybody you know you
[27:15] got all these people that that are so
[27:17] wrapped up in sports and you know that
[27:21] you know everywhere they go they got to
[27:22] have they got to have their sports team
[27:25] they got to have everything covered up
[27:27] you know we have this thing at work now
[27:29] on Fridays everybody gets to wear their
[27:30] sports team you can wear your jerseys
[27:33] and your hats and everything we're going
[27:36] to everybody got to come in deck from
[27:39] head to toe in sports stuff everybody
[27:41] got to tell you what team they're for
[27:43] and who they who they're rooting for and
[27:44] you know and and they get people getting
[27:46] these great big arguments over because
[27:48] the NBA Finals or whatever are going on
[27:50] right now you know everybody's playing
[27:51] about pro ball and you know that's
[27:53] what's going on and this one's getting
[27:55] by with that and this one's you know
[27:57] they're there the refs are hard on this
[27:59] team and you know they just arguing over
[28:01] stuff and it's like it don't matter but
[28:05] you know you got some people they're so
[28:06] wrapped up that you know they won't ever
[28:08] go anywhere unless you know I'm
[28:10] preaching up brother Jing Williams
[28:12] church one time to us you know everybody
[28:14] is orange up there boy they they're
[28:15] Clemson fans you know I said you go up
[28:17] through there and you got people up
[28:18] there and they got big Tiger tails
[28:20] hanging off the back of their car they
[28:22] won't go nowhere with a tiger tail
[28:24] hanging off the back of the car and they
[28:25] got to let everybody know that they're a
[28:27] Clemson fan got to wear the orange and
[28:29] the purple and they got to have a big
[28:30] tiger paw on everything and they got to
[28:33] have everything just so and you know
[28:34] they just can't leave home without their
[28:37] orange with their you know and then you
[28:39] got people that are Alabama they got to
[28:40] have that a and you know I there was a
[28:42] man that they drove an RV that was an
[28:44] Alabama fan and I told him that he was
[28:47] so why he was so addicted to the Crimson
[28:49] Tide that acrimony if the Alabama played
[28:51] on the moon he'd drive an RV to the moon
[28:55] he'd be on the moon upper coast he would
[28:58] have to run for Alabama because that's
[29:00] where they're playing ball you know some
[29:04] people are so addicted to stuff you know
[29:05] they they get so wrapped up in this
[29:07] antenna just conned consumes their whole
[29:10] life but you know what you try to talk
[29:11] to him about a living god that came down
[29:13] that spoke out of out of nothing he
[29:16] spoke everything into existence and you
[29:18] know what he wants to come and talk to
[29:19] you it wants to bring you eternal life
[29:22] and once it wants to make your life
[29:24] worth living he wants to touch you and
[29:26] minister to you in a special way and you
[29:28] know what they ain't got time for it
[29:31] ain't got time for it you know if we if
[29:36] we could just see his brother band said
[29:37] if we could see into that other realm if
[29:39] we could see in the other dimension to
[29:41] see what's going on we look and see boy
[29:47] is so pretty is so pretty but you know
[29:50] if we actually could see in that other
[29:52] realm you know what we wouldn't touch
[29:53] things with a ten-foot pole one because
[29:56] the spirits that our own things the
[29:59] spirit center around things we wouldn't
[30:00] touch him we wouldn't want to have
[30:03] anything to do with them but you know
[30:05] brother branham said if we could see in
[30:06] that other realm we would see that he
[30:08] said that the angels are walking up and
[30:10] down the aisles of the church the angels
[30:13] are here why because he said that he
[30:15] would be where two or three are gathered
[30:17] in my name he said there I'll be in the
[30:18] mids
[30:19] he said the angels of God are here he
[30:21] said one because they're ministering
[30:22] spirits and he said what are they come
[30:24] to do he said they come to minister to
[30:26] you see sometimes we just think well
[30:31] let's just come because you know it's
[30:32] just gonna be brother down he's just
[30:34] gonna sit here and he just go read its
[30:35] own quotes but you know what if we could
[30:37] look beyond this realm and look beyond
[30:39] the flesh you know what we could say
[30:41] Almighty God trying to speak to us
[30:47] you know it's you know because sometimes
[30:50] we get wrapped up in the veil we look we
[30:52] get wrapped up in the flesh you know
[30:54] because you know this person does a
[30:56] preach a certain way or this person -
[30:58] preaches that we don't like this person
[31:00] the way the way they're present things
[31:01] or whatever you know the thing is if we
[31:03] could get beyond that if we could get in
[31:04] the same spirit that you know what God
[31:07] could speak to us and it's not looking
[31:08] at flesh it's not looking at people but
[31:11] you know what we hear from Almighty God
[31:18] said ah I don't want I just don't want
[31:20] to do a church service just to be a
[31:22] church service because you know what we
[31:30] could just make it it's coming sit go
[31:36] home just go through the motions and you
[31:41] know what and then you know what in the
[31:42] end there's we don't we're not in closer
[31:44] to God then with us when we came we
[31:47] don't we don't get anything from God but
[31:49] you know what if we come here and expect
[31:51] God to come on the scene if we come
[31:53] expecting you know it's just like when
[31:56] that wouldn't when Friday rolls around
[31:58] you know everybody expects to get their
[32:00] paycheck or whatever time of the month
[32:04] the government decides to send you your
[32:05] money another thing is you know I thank
[32:10] God people are getting money from the
[32:11] government you know why because if you
[32:14] spent 40 or 50 years paying in I think
[32:15] you want to get something back people
[32:19] act like you like the government's
[32:21] giving you something no the government's
[32:23] taking your money all these years and
[32:24] used it for all kind and some of it's
[32:28] absolute foolishness
[32:29] you ain't got no you've got nothing to
[32:32] show for it and now you're trying to get
[32:35] some of your money back and they act
[32:37] like they're doing you a favor but you
[32:43] know the thing is is if we get something
[32:45] you know we come we expect to get money
[32:47] within you know what if we you know
[32:49] because you know what if your check they
[32:50] will make it on in the bank on Friday
[32:52] you're calling somebody
[32:56] hi you're supposed to hit the bank at
[32:58] midnight if it ain't there we're looking
[33:01] for it but you know what we don't do
[33:05] that in the house of God you know some
[33:09] people don't even show up well if we
[33:16] don't if you don't show up you know it's
[33:17] just like saying hey you know what I
[33:18] don't care if the company gives you my
[33:19] money or not but you know people people
[33:24] would get out there yet are they looking
[33:25] for their money well you know the thing
[33:27] is if you come to the house of God
[33:28] expecting it the same way you know what
[33:32] those people they pay a lot of money to
[33:34] Amazon or all these other companies you
[33:36] know what they expect their packages
[33:37] they look on their phone and it says hey
[33:39] you know your package got delivered you
[33:41] know when they get home they expect the
[33:42] package to be on the front door well you
[33:45] know what if it don't show up you know
[33:46] what they're out there call hey where's
[33:48] my package
[33:49] well you know what if you come to the
[33:51] house of God and you we're looking for
[33:53] God to speak to getting it on you come
[33:54] in say well Lord Here I am I said why
[33:56] don't you spoke to me well you know
[34:00] sometimes the reason is is because God
[34:03] never turns you away empty unless you're
[34:04] full of yourself but sometimes the
[34:09] problem is is you know just like when
[34:10] when we had that prayer line there in
[34:12] Louisiana for the young people you know
[34:14] when you go before God and you start
[34:15] praying and there's a problem you know
[34:17] what the gods obligated you come and
[34:19] speak to you to find out what the
[34:20] problem is
[34:21] maybe issues maybe there's something
[34:23] that maybe there's unconfessed sin maybe
[34:24] there's something you've got all to get
[34:26] somebody or whatever something needs to
[34:27] be straightened out but you know what if
[34:29] you get before God God will tell you
[34:30] what the problem is
[34:33] let's get before God and find out what
[34:35] the problem is
[34:38] you know God told God told Joshua to go
[34:41] before go into the land and set the
[34:43] people in order and they went in and he
[34:45] said you know what nothing is going to
[34:47] stand before you nothing stands before
[34:49] you you're going to go right in and take
[34:51] the land but you're the first time they
[34:53] lost a man God called a halt Josh gonna
[34:56] call it a halt
[34:56] talking you got to stop he said we're
[35:00] gonna find out where the CNEA is you
[35:04] know what people don't want that in
[35:05] their lives people
[35:07] whoa somebody come speak to them and
[35:08] tell them what their problem is
[35:11] why because say they hold onto some kind
[35:13] of little something that they've held on
[35:15] for years and they don't want to get rid
[35:17] of it and they think they want to be
[35:19] free but they don't if they don't want
[35:22] to be free then you know God can't help
[35:24] you but you know God is but God can tell
[35:26] you what your problem is and then you've
[35:28] got to react to it
[35:29] you've got you've got to make your
[35:30] decision whether you're gonna change it
[35:32] or not but you know we just was called a
[35:40] halt and to find out what the problem
[35:42] was you know and then when they found
[35:43] out we're Aiken Aiken had stolen the
[35:46] Babylonian garment and the gold you know
[35:50] there it was that was there was the sin
[35:52] you know what and it worked all the way
[35:54] through until it will come right down to
[35:56] Aiken and they can finally confess you
[35:58] know I'm the one I wasn't supposed to
[36:00] touch any of that stuff
[36:01] it's cursed God didn't want us have
[36:04] anything but you know what I coveted
[36:06] this and I took it and you know what
[36:09] then it caused the death of all those
[36:11] men and then because when that when the
[36:16] death came into camp then you know what
[36:18] the sentence was death you know what
[36:23] they don't kill they just kill a can
[36:25] they killed his whole family
[36:26] they killed everything they destroyed
[36:28] everything the man ever had
[36:30] thanks for trying to destroy every
[36:31] semblance and every remembrance of him
[36:35] why because I want to get that
[36:37] completely out of the camp and the thing
[36:41] is is you know we don't we don't need to
[36:43] have any who abstain from every
[36:45] appearance of evil make sure we try to
[36:47] stay far away as we can of anything that
[36:50] even remotely looks like a problem some
[36:54] people got a hold of something so well
[36:56] this won't be a problem this won't be a
[36:59] problem just said looks like that little
[37:03] story the man finding the rattlesnake
[37:05] and it's almost froze to death and you
[37:08] brought it in the house we were so well
[37:10] he was so afraid that thing was going
[37:11] day brought it in the house and left it
[37:13] won't let it warm up and that's saying
[37:16] you know the thing met him
[37:18] and he's like I can't believe you made
[37:20] me after I brought you in here and
[37:22] warmed you up saved your life he said
[37:24] you knew what it was when you brought me
[37:25] through the door he said I only done
[37:28] exactly what I am I'm a snake and I beat
[37:31] you well if you if you're gonna play
[37:37] with the world me that's what you end up
[37:38] with and it's the same thing you end up
[37:40] with the same kind of thing you give a
[37:44] place to the devil
[37:46] the scripture says we're not even
[37:47] supposed to give him a place to the
[37:49] devil but you know if he doesn't you
[37:51] know what he just steps right through
[37:52] the door well thank you very much I
[37:55] think I will then we wonder why wonder
[37:59] why the devil's call some problems in
[38:01] Arras well because you let him come in
[38:05] you know everybody's like we're gonna
[38:07] put him in this little box right here
[38:08] we'll let you have this little box right
[38:10] here you can say right here no like they
[38:15] say you give him aunt she takes a mile
[38:18] the next thing you know like what
[38:20] happened well you open the door
[38:25] we host lots of times we think well you
[38:27] know I can handle this I can handle it
[38:31] how I handle this no you can't you can't
[38:34] handle it you got it you got to get
[38:38] fortified behind the word and follow
[38:40] exactly what the word says because you
[38:43] know there's a lot of people that as
[38:45] brother branham said in birth pains he
[38:46] said there's a lot of people they only
[38:48] sympathize with the word he said they
[38:50] sympathize with it but he said they
[38:52] don't die out to it he said they don't
[38:54] get behind the word they sympathize with
[38:57] it he said that's the reason why we
[38:59] don't have many genuine new verses
[39:01] because people want to sympathize with
[39:03] it you know because you know well I
[39:06] think it's right and I'll try to I'll
[39:08] try to go along with it the best I can
[39:10] no you're an utter failure the problem
[39:14] is is you've got it you've got to go by
[39:16] the word and the thing is is the word
[39:18] requires a death because you know what
[39:20] there's a sacrifice that has to be made
[39:22] and the thing is is to receive that
[39:24] sacrifice there's got to be a death and
[39:26] yet what it is it's the death of you and
[39:28] I yes
[39:29] be a death of the old man the old erin
[39:31] roberts has to be gone there can't be
[39:33] any any any part of him
[39:36] they kept many resemblance of him
[39:38] semblance nothing it's all got to be
[39:40] gone and the old man's got to be gone
[39:42] why because christ can come in but you
[39:45] know the problem is is that's what's
[39:46] always going to be warring against us is
[39:48] because we're not allowed
[39:49] we've not allowed him to come in and
[39:51] take complete control to absolute kill
[39:54] us destroy the old old parts of the old
[39:58] man Oh effects of the old man and then
[40:04] that he can come in why because then
[40:06] it's not long no longer I'm living but
[40:08] Christ living in me I want him living in
[40:12] me let him come on the scene Brent said
[40:18] that's a lot of people that you know
[40:20] they just want they just want to have a
[40:24] they just want to have a carnal
[40:26] understanding or a concept that you know
[40:30] they want to have this mental concept of
[40:34] what's going on you know and you know
[40:36] everybody it's so it's so
[40:38] starchy and all these type things and
[40:40] you know because they they want to have
[40:42] this great intellectual understanding
[40:43] but you know brother Brahim said you
[40:46] know that's the problem he said the
[40:47] problem is and he said they're trying to
[40:49] bypass the new birth he said they're
[40:52] trying to go around the new birth and he
[40:53] said that's the problem is they got to
[40:55] come back he said why because they're
[40:56] scared of it he said they're scared of
[41:00] new birth why because what it takes
[41:01] place one because it takes a death he
[41:03] said why because the new birth is a mess
[41:05] and people don't want to come to a mess
[41:08] and they don't want to die out but
[41:10] because it messes up their way of living
[41:14] well because you know what because
[41:16] you've got to get rid of everything
[41:17] because they sometimes you people and
[41:21] they have these they have these concepts
[41:23] of what what really takes place but you
[41:25] know there was a teacher I don't know
[41:28] some of y'all probably read the story
[41:29] about the teacher that you know she
[41:30] wanted all the students said to write
[41:32] old potatoes every problem and everybody

[41:56] take your said okay from now you got to
[41:58] carry that bag everywhere you go you got
[42:01] to put it beside your desk and you set
[42:03] it beside your bed it should carry that
[42:06] thing everywhere so you know what they
[42:08] start carrying them sacks around
[42:10] everywhere they went you know what
[42:12] happened after a while then things
[42:15] started rotting and you know what
[42:19] they've become big bags of slimy goo
[42:20] yeah
[42:21] and they started carrying it around and
[42:23] you know what and some of those kids
[42:25] after a while they got tired of carrying
[42:26] those bags of goo because you know what
[42:30] they like to be Footloose and fancy-free
[42:32] But Here I am carrying this nasty bag
[42:34] around yeah and then everybody keeps
[42:36] looking at me like why are you carrying
[42:38] this bag well you know I'm carrying this
[42:42] bag because I want to and after a while
[42:46] she finally told him and she said see
[42:48] this is what happens when you hold
[42:50] grudges when you let memories influence
[42:54] your life when you let all of these
[42:57] things that have built up over time it
[42:59] just becomes this great big bag of nasty
[43:01] goo and you carry it around and you know
[43:03] what you and I have the same problem if
[43:07] we allow sin and if we allow our past to
[43:11] get in our way we're carrying that
[43:13] stinky nasty bag of goo around with us
[43:15] while we have somebody that wants to
[43:17] relieve us of that bad one because all
[43:20] of that can be put under the blood but
[43:22] you know what we will still carry that
[43:23] thing around well because the problem is
[43:26] is you think you hold a grudge against
[43:27] somebody well I'm going to get them no
[43:29] you know what you're carrying it on all
[43:31] of that weight on yourself and you know
[43:33] what you're not bothering them if I got

[43:37] what it won't bother him cuz I'm the
[43:40] ones holding the grudge I got the chip I
[43:43] got to deal with it but you know other
[43:47] thing is if we come to church you know
[43:48] we can get rid of that
[43:50] well because you know why wonder why are
[43:53] you holding on to that you think that's
[43:55] gonna benefit you what is it that you're
[43:58] holding on that you're going to get
[43:59] something out of but you know what the
[44:02] devil wants you to carry around your
[44:03] nasty bag of goon why because he's the
[44:06] one who tried to give it to you and you
[44:09] know what somewhere along the way you
[44:11] agreed to it you thought it was a good
[44:13] idea and people people have held onto
[44:17] stuff for so long and they've allowed
[44:19] the devil to whip them and beat them and
[44:21] hold them down and they stay around the
[44:23] press and they don't even realize that
[44:24] the grace of God has come to relieve you
[44:27] of all of them now I'm gonna get to my
[44:36] point sometime people will know well
[44:41] how's this have to do with getting rid
[44:42] of demons well that's what it is we're
[44:50] carrying around people carry around

[46:37] ground if I end up with cancer or some
[46:41] other thing like that you know what
[46:42] God's more than able to meet me because
[46:44] you know what I ain't in the ground yet
[46:48] you know it's what the Lord told me that
[46:50] day when I was riding in the pickup
[46:51] truck and I was praying for brother dick
[46:53] when he had had prostate cancer you know
[46:55] I was I so burdened about brother dick I
[46:57] was praying that's driving down the road
[46:58] you know what in the Lord totally said
[46:59] you know Lazarus was in the grade three
[47:05] days and brought him out of the ground
[47:08] they said you know what brother Dick's
[47:10] not that far along you know well praise
[47:14] the Lord you know what I like that you
[47:16] know I just I just perked me up you know
[47:18] why because you know we look at things
[47:20] so bad you know brother Ernie always
[47:22] tells us you know we try to pay the toll
[47:23] twice because we're paying trying to pay
[47:25] a toll on something we never got there
[47:27] yet you know you worry about - crossing
[47:31] the bridge when you get there you know
[47:34] people people you know just like anytime
[47:36] you have some little twins or some
[47:39] little ache or pain and everything like
[47:40] that well you better watch it
[47:41] that's heart attack that's an aneurysm
[47:45] yeah whatever it is you know the devil's
[47:48] come along and try to tell you
[47:48] everything in the book you know that you
[47:53] know that you know that person that you
[47:54] know you know they got sick had a
[47:55] headache one day next thing you know
[47:57] they're dead you know some people live
[48:03] on that
[48:05] more they like WebMD becomes there
[48:10] becomes a becomes their friend
[48:12] let me look when I look through this
[48:14] list of all of the symptoms that I have
[48:18] well according to WebMD I should have
[48:20] died three days ago but you know what my
[48:27] my Bible says that my God heals all
[48:30] diseases all all afflictions and no
[48:33] matter what it is because he give and
[48:36] you know the thing is this not only does
[48:37] he do it because he said that he gave me
[48:40] the power he gave me the power over all
[48:42] the powers of the enemy so the so
[48:46] whatever he has it he brings against me
[48:48] I'm the one that has to sign for it you
[48:50] know and if I want to come and say you
[48:52] know what I know get it I'm not going to
[48:54] accept that I'm not accepting that
[48:56] whatever it is you know I don't have to
[48:58] accept those things and you're the first
[49:01] thing you do is you got to come to a
[49:03] place where you accept that and you got
[49:04] to confess that then the next thing you
[49:08] know when the when your temper raises up
[49:10] which you don't supposed to have or
[49:13] whatever comes along then you know what
[49:15] then you're you know then you say that's
[49:16] that's contrary to the word and I don't
[49:18] have that then you got to pray lord help
[49:21] me get through this because you know
[49:22] what I die you know I don't have the
[49:23] strength to get through this and
[49:29] sometimes we know we know what's going
[49:31] to happen before it happens because
[49:32] sometimes situations arising you know
[49:35] what we know what's gonna happen before
[49:36] we get there and you know what and some
[49:40] people you know they don't pray before
[49:41] they get there and I don't pray before I
[49:43] get there sometimes and things happen
[49:45] and you know what we get bent out of
[49:47] shape and it's you know if we were if we
[49:53] were to pray through ahead of time lord
[49:58] help me get through that I don't know
[49:59] what to say but don't let me say
[50:02] anything that's gonna be contrary to the
[50:04] word don't let don't let me say anything
[50:08] that's that's gonna be a hindrance if we
[50:13] could say that you know the Lord can
[50:16] come on the scene and move
[50:23] but you know we have to be able to lean
[50:26] on him rely on him Lord let us come and
[50:30] and get what we have need of help us
[50:33] Lord because you know he give but he's
[50:36] instilled he's giving you the power you
[50:41] know all the all the things that that's
[50:44] happened in your life all of all of the
[50:46] powers of the enemy whatever he's done
[50:48] you know he give you the power to
[50:50] overcome it and then you know what the
[50:53] thing is is you've got to be the one to
[50:55] come and and and claim victory over that
[50:58] it's got to be you taking victory over
[51:00] him because if we don't you know then we
[51:04] just allow him to take to have the
[51:07] victory we need to be and you know
[51:12] whatever whatever you have need of you
[51:15] know many people you know I'm convinced
[51:18] you know just like brother Brent said
[51:19] there's so many people the problem is is
[51:22] they've gotten to the point where they
[51:24] they think then they're okay you know
[51:29] and the problem is you know there's so
[51:31] many people that they don't have the new
[51:33] birth they're not born again you know
[51:37] there's so many people that you know
[51:38] it's it's just well I believe the
[51:40] prophets message you know and you know
[51:43] and and I and I do this and I do that
[51:47] well you know what
[51:49] you know if you've not if you've not had
[51:51] a definite experience in justification
[51:55] sanctification and the baptism of the
[51:57] Holy Ghost and you know the thing is
[51:59] brother brother and said you can have a
[52:01] definite not experiencing that and and
[52:07] everybody's like you know everybody's
[52:08] well you know it's all about we're gonna
[52:10] speak in tongues so we're gonna run the
[52:12] aisle and you know people come out of
[52:14] Pentecost war you know what I think
[52:15] speaking in tongues but you know what
[52:18] they just blows there it just blows
[52:19] their experience out of the water it's
[52:21] like well I don't know I don't know what
[52:22] my experience is because you know what
[52:24] because I know it ain't speaking in
[52:25] tongues because you know I've seen
[52:28] people come and come the altar and you
[52:30] know they get slain in the spirit and
[52:32] fall
[52:32] all over the place and and you run the
[52:34] aisles and do all kinds of things and
[52:36] great things happen to him and you know
[52:37] and the next thing you know they get up
[52:39] could fight a buzzsaw and the next thing
[52:41] you know they don't they denied that
[52:42] even their brother branham was a prophet
[52:47] claim claim to believe this message and
[52:49] then they walk out on it and say brother
[52:51] Adams Falls and the next thing you know
[52:55] people run around and and women sleeping
[52:57] with with other women's husbands and it
[53:02] what's so funny is because you know what
[53:05] you know years ago they wouldn't even
[53:07] dare think of that and now they think
[53:09] it's okay
[53:11] well because it's the spirit age that we
[53:13] live in everything's okay just do what
[53:15] you want to that's the reason I get so
[53:21] tired of hearing people say well god
[53:23] knows my heart you know well I just love
[53:25] the Lord you know it's just what I feel
[53:27] down on the inside well the problem is
[53:32] God knows your heart but you know the
[53:37] problem is as peoples had their
[53:38] conscience seared one because God's
[53:43] tried to deal with people and try to
[53:45] point them in the right direction but
[53:47] you know what they just done whatever
[53:48] they want to the problem is you know the
[53:52] world's full of religious demons you
[53:55] know that's that's that's what makes up
[53:57] message churches people people don't
[54:01] want to believe that but you know it's
[54:02] religious spirits
[54:04] got people that do or do you know that
[54:07] would know it stab you still you're
[54:09] blind do all kinds of stuff and believe
[54:10] brother better to be a prophet there's
[54:15] there's people if you cross them if they
[54:17] had half a chance they take you out back
[54:19] and they beat you bloody and they are I
[54:26] believe otherwise be a prophet you know
[54:31] I you know I'd be I'd be ashamed to
[54:33] stand up I'd be like brother Billy Paul
[54:34] said that time when he's down there in
[54:36] the pool hall and they said hey this is
[54:38] brother this is this is Reverend
[54:39] branham's boy hey guy come here Reverend
[54:42] Bridals boy down here in the pool hall
[54:44] shooting po-han Oh only
[54:46] ungodly people down here and he said no
[54:48] sir he said Reverend Branham wouldn't
[54:50] have a son like me you know I'd be
[54:58] ashamed to go around and talk to some
[55:00] people because yeah and you try to live
[55:01] that kind of life you know the thing is
[55:05] is people you know and people wondering
[55:07] why the churches are in the condition
[55:09] they're in why because this is what was
[55:10] supposed to take place what did what did
[55:14] brother bet him say he said he said
[55:16] those fallen angel said came he said
[55:18] what they do they come to the message
[55:20] this he said he said fallen angels where
[55:22] he said Luther what was in Luther's day
[55:25] the fallen angels Wesley the Pentecost
[55:27] was all messed up why because those
[55:30] fallen angels came in why because they
[55:32] had to come in and and combat and risk
[55:35] and fight against the Spirit of God that
[55:37] was moving some one because he brought
[55:40] that spirit to a good rebel against them
[55:43] but what one came in our day what does
[55:46] that are they won because it's the same
[55:47] spirit he's come to fight against you
[55:56] and you know and not only that we got
[55:58] people you got people in this message
[56:00] they wouldn't they wouldn't hurt a fly
[56:02] they're just good moral people man
[56:06] they're wonderful but you know the
[56:08] problem is is you can't get them to see
[56:10] that they're not born again they they
[56:14] they they live a good justified life a
[56:17] good sanctified life but you know what
[56:19] they born again they born again but you
[56:22] know what they live a great moral life
[56:24] you can't put a finger on their life and
[56:28] you know what you know those people oh I
[56:29] believe brother and I love all that all
[56:32] that he loved and all that loves him be
[56:33] there we enter one that's a wonderful
[56:38] statement and it's what brother Branham
[56:40] said that's what the angel the Lord told
[56:42] him but you know what didn't change the
[56:44] fact that you got to be born amen
[56:48] [Applause]
[56:50] and you know what sometimes sometimes I
[56:53] think you know years ago people used to
[56:55] have means even brother branham talked
[56:56] about in the message why is the why is
[56:58] this the holy you know what was the holy
[57:00] ghost skin for what is the holy ghost
[57:02] you know he said we're opening the
[57:05] tabernacle he said if you don't want to
[57:07] come during this time and pray for
[57:10] people that are seeking the Holy Ghost
[57:13] nowadays if you talk about siccing the
[57:16] Holy Ghost in the message they want to
[57:17] kick you out if you get up and say well
[57:23] you know what it takes three processes
[57:24] there's three steps of grace that it
[57:26] takes to get born again it's
[57:27] justification sanctification and the
[57:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost and some
[57:31] people want to throw you out how in the
[57:34] world can you preach those three brother
[57:36] Branham said it was all the way up until
[57:41] I think it was November of 1965 the
[57:44] latter or October of 65 the last time
[57:46] brother brother dogs about it it's like
[57:49] oh well he changed it after the seals
[57:51] well he didn't changing my message can't
[57:56] change the Bible but you know the thing
[57:59] is is people want to throw yeah well you
[58:01] know hey you know it's just it's just
[58:03] receiving the Holy Ghost well you know
[58:05] the problem is a lot of people have
[58:06] received the Holy Ghost they've got an
[58:09] anointing they've got anointed but you
[58:12] know what those spirits are still there
[58:13] those same religious spirits are still
[58:15] there still binding the people but it
[58:22] takes the Holy Ghost he takes a dying
[58:24] out it takes well because you a lot of
[58:26] people that they didn't they've gotten
[58:27] away from that you know we don't we
[58:28] don't need we don't need laying before
[58:31] God but I think I was brother down
[58:33] talking about was it buddy Robinson he
[58:37] was telling about the other day you know
[58:38] he'd done it got down in the cornfield
[58:40] or whatever he said Lord he said I'm
[58:41] gonna be right here till I get to Holy
[58:44] Ghost be right here be a back of bones
[58:47] and gonna be right here why because
[58:49] people don't get that serious with God
[58:52] people don't want to get to that place
[58:56] you know there was a man one time they
[58:59] told me that he said I got down
[59:02] you know I'm just I'm just gonna stay
[59:04] home and I'm on prey and he said I'm not
[59:06] gonna do nothing now gonna eat and do
[59:08] nothing he said until the Lord comes
[59:10] speak to me Lord I want the Holy Ghost I
[59:12] want to know what the new birth is I
[59:14] want it so bad he said I'm gonna stay
[59:15] right here till I got it
[59:17] he said I ain't going to sleep hang onto
[59:19] it and you know what the Lord come and
[59:21] spoke to him he said the Lord come to
[59:23] him you know why because he got serious
[59:25] you know many times we get wrapped up in
[59:28] so many other things but you know we got
[59:30] to get to the place where we're we sell
[59:32] everything out we don't worry about
[59:33] nothing else is an important center life
[59:35] until we hear from God and then if we
[59:40] can get to that place then you know what
[59:41] then we can hear from God then he can
[59:46] come on the scene but you know that's
[59:50] what it takes it takes the Holy Ghost
[59:54] because you know the Jesus in jesus said
[59:58] and that day people will come to me and
[59:59] say Lord Lord did we cast out Devils in
[1:00:01] your name did we do all these great
[1:00:03] wonderful mighty things in your name and
[1:00:05] he said depart from me because I didn't
[1:00:06] know you you know what you can you can
[1:00:09] heaven you can be anointed of the Holy
[1:00:11] Ghost and do great things but you know
[1:00:12] what that ain't the new birth that ain't
[1:00:15] that ain't where you need to be but you
[1:00:18] know some people they've gotten to the
[1:00:19] place where you know they've got it all
[1:00:20] figured out in their mind and if you try
[1:00:23] even when the Holy Ghost comes and tries
[1:00:24] to deal with them you know what they've
[1:00:26] already they've already been sealed off
[1:00:27] they've already been seared they're
[1:00:29] conscious that God can't even speak to
[1:00:31] them anymore
[1:00:32] and the thing is is have we got to that
[1:00:35] exact same place where God can speak to
[1:00:38] us you know and find out exactly where
[1:00:40] we are
[1:00:41] and it takes going beyond just the new
[1:00:45] birth but you know because there's
[1:00:47] there's a higher Heights and God besides
[1:00:50] getting past the new birth but you know
[1:00:51] what if you hadn't got that far then
[1:00:52] that's where you need to be because you
[1:00:55] know what the thing is is if you have
[1:00:57] them if you have the new birth inside of
[1:00:59] you then he the spirit of truth comes
[1:01:02] and he said he will lead you and guide
[1:01:04] you into all truth
[1:01:05] he's going to bring you to all truth and
[1:01:08] you know what the thing is is the one
[1:01:10] thing is is whatever Satan says is not
[1:01:12] the truth
[1:01:14] you know the thing is is just like
[1:01:17] brother I've said you know the Holy
[1:01:18] Ghost is a gentleman he's that dove
[1:01:22] he's a dove and he comes and he lands on
[1:01:26] you but he said you've got to have the
[1:01:27] right nature
[1:01:29] the lamb only come I'm sorry the Dove
[1:01:31] only comes to the lamb he said if we
[1:01:34] don't have a lamb nature than the doves
[1:01:36] not coming he said when we get beyond
[1:01:39] that he said then he flies away and he
[1:01:41] waits for us to get back to that lamb
[1:01:43] nature he said so the Holy Ghost can
[1:01:45] come back I think the thing is is we
[1:01:48] need to just like he said you got to be
[1:01:49] sensitive to the Holy Ghost because he
[1:01:51] said he is a gentleman and see the thing
[1:01:54] is is do we get so sensitive in our in
[1:01:56] our spiritual walk that we know what's
[1:01:58] going to take place can we can we just
[1:02:00] because sometimes we get so desensitized
[1:02:03] to things in life that we miss what God
[1:02:06] is trying to tell us and if we can if we
[1:02:12] get to that place see then you can cast
[1:02:14] the devil out well cause he's got no
[1:02:21] place to stay you know like I was
[1:02:27] telling about having the prayer lines
[1:02:29] you know people what people say well you
[1:02:31] know they what they want to have a
[1:02:32] prayer line and they won't they want to
[1:02:35] cast out Devils you know the thing is is
[1:02:38] then you don't cast them out the people
[1:02:41] do
[1:02:41] there's no preacher going to cast them
[1:02:43] out the preacher can come and pray for
[1:02:50] you and the Spirit of the Lord can come
[1:02:52] down so you can cast him out you've got
[1:02:56] to be the one that does it and that you
[1:02:59] come and they come they can pray and the
[1:03:02] Spirit of God because everybody binds
[1:03:05] together that you can cast him out
[1:03:07] you've got to be the one to speak the
[1:03:09] word for him to leave see there's no
[1:03:13] there's no one person that you know that
[1:03:15] well I I got to wait for brother Dale to
[1:03:17] pray and then when brother Dale speaks
[1:03:19] the word then the Devils gonna leave me
[1:03:22] well you know what the devil's gonna
[1:03:24] stay right there
[1:03:26] because you've got to be the one you've
[1:03:28] got to speak it because just like just
[1:03:34] like he was some of the people in the
[1:03:36] the man that fell over his feet you know
[1:03:39] that had that spirit you know that
[1:03:40] spirit never would leaving hey he was so
[1:03:45] bound to that thing he was so connected
[1:03:47] that he couldn't get rid of it but
[1:03:50] that's the same thing with you and I
[1:03:51] we've got to get to the pole where we
[1:03:53] can get you know let the Holy Spirit
[1:03:55] come whatever whatever you whatever
[1:03:58] you're fighting whatever you're battling
[1:04:00] the thing is is he's here to meet your
[1:04:02] need hey Sarah he's here to show you
[1:04:05] that you're equipped for it because you
[1:04:08] know well the thing is is like you said
[1:04:09] we gotta have faith to operate that
[1:04:12] power the power is given to us the way
[1:04:16] that we have the power is ours the thing
[1:04:21] is is you got to have the faith to
[1:04:22] operate it to believe to make it work
[1:04:24] you love the Lord tonight Amen god bless
[1:04:29] you now let's all stand amen
[1:04:53] just got to stand fortified behind the
[1:04:55] word the word has been given to us God's
[1:05:00] called us to this place the thing is is
[1:05:03] now we got to stand there take what God
[1:05:06] has given to us and claim it god I want
[1:05:11] I want what you got for me I want I want
[1:05:14] to be what you have me to be all right
[1:05:18] but just like brother Jill always says
[1:05:21] you know you can't talk the devil's
[1:05:22] language and you know you can't you
[1:05:27] can't dwell on the things that are
[1:05:29] contrary to the word because you know
[1:05:33] that's what the devil wants you to do
[1:05:37] you know people think you know certain
[1:05:40] things happen you know just like like at
[1:05:43] work with they've had they've had some
[1:05:45] changes at work and bosses and all kind
[1:05:48] you know different things changing and
[1:05:50] everybody's like well this ain't gonna
[1:05:52] be good this ain't gonna be good it's
[1:05:55] terrible I don't know what I'm gonna do
[1:05:57] and they just and everybody gets all
[1:05:59] worked up about all this stuff is like
[1:06:00] well you know what the Lord knew about
[1:06:02] it before it ever happened and you know
[1:06:05] what no matter no matter how much they
[1:06:07] you know they bring my way you know what
[1:06:08] I you know what where the devil does you
[1:06:12] know it happens whether it's good or bad
[1:06:15] you know what I'm just gonna praise the
[1:06:16] Lord and go on but sometimes we get we
[1:06:19] get so wrapped up on these things and
[1:06:21] you know the you have you have family
[1:06:24] members and you know whatever whatever
[1:06:27] it is going in on in their life you'll
[1:06:30] have family members and you know they
[1:06:33] come along and they've got this problem
[1:06:35] and that problem they won't drag you in
[1:06:36] on it and you know your children and and
[1:06:40] all these things you know they they're
[1:06:42] there and you know that's just the way
[1:06:43] the devil works that he's gonna try to
[1:06:44] stir things up but you know the thing is
[1:06:47] is is if we have the token if the token
[1:06:52] has been given to us if we're sealed
[1:06:55] then you know what the thing is
[1:06:57] we can apply the token to them and you
[1:06:59] know the thing is is when that when that
[1:07:01] token has been applied then the thing is
[1:07:04] it's time for us to take our hands off
[1:07:06] it we just need to leave it alone let
[1:07:09] God move and so well you know lord I
[1:07:11] give it to you you know what I'm done
[1:07:16] you know and everything well this
[1:07:18] happens or that happens you know what
[1:07:19] Lord you know if if it if it's your will
[1:07:22] and that's and that's what it takes to
[1:07:23] get them then just give them a double
[1:07:24] portion egg and you know and sometimes
[1:07:29] that's the hardest thing to do but you
[1:07:33] know sometimes sometimes you know that's
[1:07:35] what God wants us to do to realize you
[1:07:36] know I'm in control and if we understand
[1:07:41] God's in control then you know what we
[1:07:42] can take our hands off it and say Lord
[1:07:44] just move just like that just like that
[1:07:48] lady it was read around talks about I
[1:07:50] think it was in letting off the pressure
[1:07:51] you're talking about that young that
[1:07:52] lady looks so young had grown sons and
[1:07:54] you know he couldn't leave she was that
[1:07:56] old and say well you know when I got say
[1:07:57] years ago Lord said that he'd take care
[1:07:59] everything and so you know I've realized
[1:08:03] that if the Lord couldn't take care of
[1:08:04] it I serve the couldn't take care of it
[1:08:06] so there what no need of me of worrying
[1:08:07] about it and that's the thing they do
[1:08:12] not worry about it
[1:08:14] but you know what don't give a place to
[1:08:16] the devil right find it wear it wherever
[1:08:20] is in the word whatever it is and find
[1:08:22] and find your answer and then you take
[1:08:24] that and you fortify yourself behind the
[1:08:27] word and let the devil flee because he
[1:08:31] said if you resist the devil you flee
[1:08:34] from you Amen god bless you brother sing
