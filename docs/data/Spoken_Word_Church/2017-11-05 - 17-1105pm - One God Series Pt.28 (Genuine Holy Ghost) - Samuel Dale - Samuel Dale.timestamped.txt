[21:21] John 1 in the beginning was the word and
[21:28] the Word was with God and the Word was
[21:29] God the same was in the beginning with
[21:32] God all things were made by him and
[21:34] without him was not anything made that
[21:36] was made in him was life and the life
[21:39] was a lot of men and the light shine us
[21:42] in darkness and the darkness
[21:44] comprehended it not that's something
[21:47] then there's no way that darkness can
[21:51] understand the Word of God let's go to
[21:53] 1st Thessalonians 5 we begin but verse
[21:58] 15 and our thought says quints not the
[22:01] spirit this tries not prophesy and prove
[22:06] all things hold fast that which is good
[22:11] abstain from all appearance of evil and
[22:14] the very God of your God of peace
[22:17] sanctify you wholly and I pray God your
[22:20] whole spirit and soul and body be
[22:23] preserved blameless under the coming of
[22:26] our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated
[22:29] the Lord had his blessing to the reading
[22:31] of the word to try to pick up our
[22:37] thought you carry on from this morning
[22:41] and then the Lord within Wednesday we'll
[22:43] get on into the creation part and start
[22:46] with just want to hold your mind and
[22:50] your thoughts to what we're trying to
[22:51] get to now the purpose in the past
[22:56] couple of messages and we used in you
[23:01] know the scriptures there were that Paul
[23:03] was worried that Satan through his
[23:07] subtilty would
[23:09] see the minds of the people all right
[23:13] and you say well that can't be done it
[23:16] was done the church went into darkness
[23:20] in the Dark Ages now I know you take
[23:23] your vain philosophies because I've been
[23:26] around long enough as a human to think
[23:29] about what people think
[23:31] you take your vain philosophies of your
[23:34] thoughts and then you'll say well what
[23:36] it was the people just died and that's
[23:43] what went with the words you know was
[23:46] just the death of people well why did
[23:52] the church have to come out of it who
[23:54] was that if it was it was still and I
[23:56] believe and it can be proven that there
[23:59] is a fine line of true truth that did
[24:04] come down through the ages to hold to a
[24:07] lot of things that were good and you've
[24:12] got to full-on adulterated word coming
[24:14] up to at least the fourth Church age
[24:18] we're Martin than them you know and and
[24:20] the dead raised to sit healed all kind
[24:22] of things in Martin's ministry Ron said
[24:25] to Grady since the Lord Jesus all right
[24:28] now there's a line down through there in
[24:32] your thoughts but it won't line up
[24:34] because it was the bride see your
[24:36] prophet is the one that said the bride
[24:38] fell it and I see yeah let's see we want
[24:41] to say oh go we didn't the real bride
[24:43] didn't go see that's your thoughts of
[24:48] trying to prop up your ideas instead of
[24:51] saying what the Prophet said so now
[24:55] what's the difference in that didn't
[24:56] what the devil was telling Eve in the
[24:58] garden he was telling her tonight 9.99
[25:03] 5.9% truth and for us to go with the
[25:08] philosophies you know because I've tried
[25:09] to preach to people and then say well
[25:12] you know like I remember when I preached
[25:14] it on the CEOs in them feel CEO came up
[25:17] and we're talking about the Jews that
[25:20] God blinded him I had a couple of
[25:23] mr.brother and that differed with me and
[25:25] said they didn't believe God blinded him
[25:27] I said well the Bible says it the
[25:31] Prophet says it he blinded him to bring
[25:36] us in so I'm going to stay with that
[25:39] thing alright see the other things is
[25:43] your thoughts to try to make some
[25:45] reasoning factor that can do and we're
[25:49] supposed to cast down those things and
[25:51] listen to the words of the Prophet and
[25:54] let him describe it because he was the
[25:58] one to bring the message alright and in
[26:01] doing that that's why I vent aside so
[26:04] much that when that they were told in
[26:06] Genesis to multiply and replenish the
[26:10] Prophet we gave them that I wouldn't own
[26:13] coming promise well I just don't see how
[26:16] that could be did that change the
[26:18] Prophet saying it was no that's where I
[26:24] stand with that way on the work I've got
[26:26] to do you say well well I don't think
[26:29] he's you don't think that we don't have
[26:31] no rights to think so we read it over
[26:35] and over gave it to you that the Prophet
[26:37] said it would have finally that even
[26:40] Isaiah was to come to the wound of Eve
[26:45] and we're not talking about necessarily
[26:47] wound as a physical sex act as we want
[26:51] to call him God it wouldn't have been
[26:52] that anyway had it been that prophet
[26:57] said what the spoken word would have
[27:00] brought it forth
[27:00] all right so forget it now okay we see
[27:04] the spoken word would have brought
[27:06] through the wound of merit of Eve Isaiah
[27:11] into existence she would have finally
[27:14] brought forth that child and he's so
[27:16] much a Christ child
[27:19] see we wonder we I can't figure that out
[27:25] you can't figure out the Word of God
[27:29] quickest you get it about halfway lined
[27:31] up the devil of running in and there you
[27:34] go sailing out across the yard trying to
[27:38] find you another liam to land oh right
[27:41] the best thing to do is just settle down
[27:43] think about it
[27:46] Adam and Eve was told multiply and
[27:49] replenish the earth it would have
[27:52] happened had he not been a fall all
[27:56] right but there was a fall
[27:58] what's the difference he's happening now
[28:02] God is bringing forth his children right
[28:05] so it's not something that we that it
[28:08] went off because of that it's Satan
[28:10] helping God fulfill his whole plan all
[28:14] right
[28:15] how much did Adam understand I kind of
[28:21] had a little questions given to me
[28:24] knowing I can cover it a little bit
[28:27] how much Adam understood of the story I
[28:31] don't have any thoughts or you know
[28:34] knowing from brother branham and
[28:36] listening I remember some things too
[28:39] that I remember the Bible standing
[28:41] wasn't deceived you know like that I
[28:44] know the Prophet said that he sold out
[28:47] the human race we believe all that well
[28:50] then he had to have some knowledge of
[28:54] things but how much that was before the
[28:59] fall to even things produced I don't
[29:02] know what I'm not really that concerned
[29:04] but I do believe that probably he had a
[29:08] knowledge of the tree of life because I
[29:12] mean the tree of you know he would had
[29:14] the knowledge of the tree of life and
[29:16] what that would have been Christ and I
[29:19] believe he had a knowledge of the tree
[29:21] you know a knowledge of the knowledge of
[29:25] the tree you know now remember you're
[29:27] not talking about a tree anyway you're
[29:30] talking about a person
[29:35] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[29:37] Jesus Christ excuse me the tree of
[29:44] knowledge of good and evil would have
[29:46] been Satan on that the tree of life true
[29:49] knowledge would have been Jesus Christ
[29:53] but the knowledge of good and evil you
[29:55] to run that over to Satan then Satan
[29:59] through that beast using him to talk I
[30:02] must Adam understood I don't always
[30:06] tried to be honest I don't think he was
[30:10] just dumbfounded and didn't know nothing
[30:13] about what was going on I mean he said
[30:20] well he didn't know this he didn't know
[30:21] that well whatever it was got kept him
[30:23] from knowing it but he could probably
[30:26] look and put together a lot of things
[30:31] gonna remember he had a pretty good
[30:33] knowledge he named all the animals yet
[30:36] all the time but the point that I'm
[30:39] getting at I don't know how much he
[30:43] would understood of how things would
[30:45] have been working right I have no
[30:49] problems with him having some knowledge
[30:53] because surely he could see the
[30:57] reproductive life of the animals and
[31:02] follow that and he could see him and her
[31:06] and all of the things that were there
[31:11] but remember it was a tree of knowledge
[31:16] of good and evil so that's the point
[31:23] I've tried to drive to you that Eve took
[31:28] that tree first not a physical act the
[31:34] physical act was with the beast right
[31:41] the physical act was with the Beast read
[31:46] around said on greatest battle ever
[31:48] fought
[31:48] I believe this one will read maybe in a
[31:50] minute where he said it was the
[31:52] intercourse of her mind
[31:56] there was the fall the act was just a
[32:02] manifestation it had to have a party to
[32:07] take part of it huh so that's why Satan
[32:10] used the Beast we see we just put it
[32:14] beast we put it that line we don't look
[32:17] at it that Eve accepted Satan's lie
[32:21] there is the tree of knowledge of good
[32:25] and evil there was no ability of Satan
[32:28] to have any act creative or any form
[32:33] with Eve so he had to use the beast to
[32:39] try to bring forth all right so then how
[32:42] much he was understood in what was going
[32:44] on I don't know I do know that was a
[32:47] they had all as they looked at
[32:49] everything it was dire I don't believe
[32:53] Adam was so blinded you know I don't
[33:00] believe he was just totally blinded to
[33:01] everything there's no need of him being
[33:04] that way but just remember the tree of
[33:07] knowledge of good and evil was not the
[33:09] beast the tree of knowledge of good and
[33:16] evil was Satan right and there wasn't
[33:21] two physical trees standing there that
[33:25] was probably different one tree to the
[33:27] other one the garden was full of trees
[33:32] if the tree of life was Jesus Christ
[33:35] he wasn't down there with him walking
[33:37] around right even though he could have
[33:42] been if he wanted to but he wasn't dire
[33:45] right so the tree of knowledge of good
[33:48] and evil was not the beast so you're
[33:52] taking the secondary part to making it
[33:55] all the fall was her spiritual being to
[33:59] be perverted and being that perverted
[34:05] then it would come forth with the
[34:07] natural act well so then I hope that
[34:12] that's that we follow it he all right
[34:15] Satan you brother Branham says that that
[34:19] was the only way for him to be able to
[34:22] in inner what in any way enter the human
[34:26] race was through the Beast because
[34:30] remember it was the Beast the Bible
[34:32] tells you and even Scofield and his
[34:34] riding said he went some other way he
[34:37] said to fall made him go to the ground
[34:40] as the snake reads you Bible read you
[34:43] footnotes from some of these riders
[34:45] alright now once that beast came into
[34:50] being Satan could use him to try to
[34:56] enter the human race but just remember
[35:01] his inter rode into the human race was
[35:05] through the spirit the mind the
[35:09] conscious the beings of Eve what would
[35:17] happen you say seeds you say well this
[35:19] can't be but what if it happened to have
[35:21] been no act it wouldn't make no
[35:24] difference Eve was just as polluted
[35:28] before the act as she would actually act
[35:30] the act was just physical
[35:35] her mind was polluted to God's Word no
[35:42] she surely was polluted see for him to
[35:48] explain to her and looked like she
[35:51] should have known it was wrong for her
[35:56] that animal that is the attributes but
[36:03] we think we know the message because
[36:05] we've come to the basis of understanding
[36:08] what took place in the garden was a sex
[36:10] act and see we think we've got it all
[36:14] figured out that's not the polluting of
[36:16] the human race the polluting of the
[36:19] human race physically yes sure yes
[36:24] spiritually speaking the intercourse of
[36:27] his mind started the pollution in the
[36:29] human race okay and you and I are today
[36:35] are facing that same devil not do it
[36:41] what I don't know her brother Dale are
[36:43] you trying to say that some of us
[36:45] physically speaking are from the Beast
[36:56] they are people in the water all are you
[37:01] gonna try to figure out it you're not
[37:03] ain't gonna worry about it
[37:05] that's what I've always said I don't
[37:08] care you run my DNA all the way back
[37:12] into the garden and lay me straight with
[37:15] the Beast
[37:16] that ain't doing nothing to me that
[37:20] don't change nothing in my thinking that
[37:22] enhances my thinking that God could save
[37:25] me right nor to make you happy if it
[37:33] went that way see we want to figure out
[37:36] you know I'm just playing I talk blinded
[37:39] I'm sorry a lot of people believe the
[37:42] beast was the black people but see we we
[37:46] believe a prophet he said well if that
[37:50] be so he said it would have ended it
[37:51] flood that sounds a problem right it's a
[38:00] flood you only had ham Shem and Japheth
[38:02] to reproduce after then and knowing as
[38:06] why see your prophet gives you the
[38:10] answer and it shows our stupidity to try
[38:15] to look at him we go look a big old
[38:18] Giants in the land look at them
[38:20] seven-foot basketball player
[38:22] I mean they they stand up do this you
[38:25] know they don't have to jump to dunk
[38:27] they just lay the ball down what I take
[38:32] that back boy look well what if you're
[38:35] one of them that's always gets me you
[38:39] know what gets me is people humanely
[38:42] okay they've got these bright ideas say
[38:48] like that this is an illustration they
[38:50] did having their mind thinking you know
[38:51] with him judge them Giants now that's
[38:56] the seat of the beast and all at once
[38:59] they have a child and he winds up seven
[39:00] or eight foot tall boy they go haywire
[39:04] then right don't worry about it look
[39:10] here if I 4 foot 3 or what I am I don't
[39:14] know how to do with it but see the fall
[39:18] was in the garden before the act took
[39:21] place that's the emphasis I'm making
[39:24] because the fall is still here we're not
[39:29] dealing with sex acts today what I'm
[39:32] talking about the fall being here in the
[39:34] Satan being is not sex acts its
[39:39] intercourse of the human mind that Satan
[39:43] is polluting our minds what was the
[39:48] difference in Cain and Abel cocaine was
[39:53] of the beast and Abel wasn't had him do
[39:57] you mean that makes a difference you
[40:00] know which side well why did both of
[40:05] them offer an offer available was so
[40:08] good why did he offer an offering he's
[40:16] so good he didn't need one he looks over
[40:19] Kane said go make your an offering how
[40:21] did nothing but you see that's the
[40:24] reason I get into trouble
[40:26] because I lay it out like that and what
[40:28] are you gonna do with it I ain't gonna
[40:30] believe it it's exactly right it ain't
[40:33] gonna change your thinking unless God
[40:35] changed
[40:36] and when he changes it you'll see what
[40:39] truth is but did you do you see what I'm
[40:44] trying to get the fall was already in
[40:46] that garden before the act took place
[40:49] the fall is still here now you don't
[40:52] have to worry about natural acts it is
[40:57] here now in you and me through our
[41:00] spiritual being and you know I've always
[41:04] tried to explain that me the Bible the
[41:10] Prophet says in the Prophet City this
[41:13] way a Christian is the only one that can
[41:17] sin code everything else condemned on a
[41:23] higher level all that's done is finished
[41:24] it already of sin but I don't see them
[41:27] bless God I didn't write the book
[41:35] they're Christian the only one who can
[41:37] sin but word is a Christian sin they
[41:44] don't matter about the body cause I
[41:45] ain't gonna do it that's a secondary
[41:47] because that has to be motivated by
[41:49] something else so you got two factors to
[41:51] deal with soul and spirit so now which
[41:55] one when you have a wrong call or idea
[41:58] or a concept or anything or whatever you
[42:01] do something wrong who is it doesn't
[42:03] happen which old the devil made me do it
[42:10] but what part of you as a Christian can
[42:15] do enough wrong till the Bible would
[42:17] call it sin is this your by I'm an
[42:23] immature soul or your spirit which one
[42:30] is it it does it remember the Bible says
[42:35] the soul that sinneth it shall die but
[42:42] remember one other thing I thought in
[42:43] your mind do you say brother deal you
[42:46] shouldn't put it out that way cause you
[42:48] give us too much to think about
[42:49] the word in the New Testament of soul
[42:51] and spirit is a totally interchangeable
[42:54] word Schofield understands that you get
[43:01] a change sometimes read silk Scofield's
[43:04] account of Genesis in his footnotes
[43:10] which you know how he explains it
[43:13] exactly the way brother Branham
[43:16] explained it in his early ministry may
[43:20] be ready to run read a lot in it read
[43:23] your Scofield footnotes
[43:24] he explains the fall of mankind he
[43:28] explains it just that it was an upright
[43:31] creature and then it was might of snake
[43:35] he explained all of those things and
[43:38] even wording that brother Branham will
[43:41] speak you'll find Scofield was the words
[43:46] he copied from so then where are we
[43:52] going can we read it that Salone ends
[43:56] that it says that's your whole spirit
[44:00] soul and body so the Bible knows of
[44:05] spirit soul and body like I told you
[44:11] there was a doctrine I run into it for
[44:14] running of the message that believes you
[44:16] didn't have a soul until a law came
[44:22] because you didn't have a right to
[44:24] choose until the law put it in your path
[44:29] well that's what I asked the man I said
[44:31] how about reading to me there in Genesis
[44:34] we read into that or nostril and he
[44:36] become a living soul he said I never
[44:38] thought about that because you see I've
[44:42] always believed the word but I know by
[44:46] reading and trying to get a relate you
[44:51] heard run around talk about the before
[44:52] and the after
[44:55] right you know before and after explain
[44:59] something
[45:04] stand on board step on this board and
[45:07] board this ship
[45:10] cuz I'm bored with you all spell to son
[45:18] how do you define what is being saying
[45:22] simple come on board that means come on
[45:25] board standing on this board that means
[45:28] this board because I'm bored with you
[45:32] the before and the after explains it so
[45:35] you go into Bible and you're reading
[45:38] about the spirit read the before and
[45:43] read the after and get the text that's
[45:45] in and it will explain whether it's
[45:50] speaking of the Spirit of God or the
[45:53] soul or what it's explaining read the
[45:58] prophets message listen to what he's
[46:00] talking about
[46:03] it's self-explanatory he explains
[46:05] herself as you say you've always though
[46:13] said that he did he I didn't say he was
[46:15] wrong in his early ministry I've never
[46:17] said he was wrong in his early ministry
[46:19] you showed me that the run was wrong in
[46:27] his early ministry other than the things
[46:29] he was wrong on then he corrected he
[46:34] said well he didn't correct body spirit
[46:36] and so he didn't have to because he
[46:38] always had a crown being of Menka he
[46:47] always had a crown being but the way you
[46:52] know what he's talking about his read
[46:54] the text he's bringing it in because he
[46:58] knew the Bible said it's your body
[46:59] spirit and soul he never had to change
[47:03] because he always gave the body five
[47:07] senses he always gave the second room no
[47:11] matter what he called it
[47:14] memory reason conscious affections etc
[47:18] he always gave the sinner room the
[47:22] controlling factor of mankind one thing
[47:25] which is either faith or doubt it's the
[47:32] same thing he said in 65 up when he was
[47:35] saying back there he was saying body
[47:38] soul spirit 65
[47:41] he says body spirit and soul he still
[47:46] give him the same senses he still given
[47:52] the same three in the three sense the
[47:54] thing that has each one of the same it's
[48:00] not saying he's wrong in no way because
[48:06] I'll remind you of one thing the way I
[48:08] believe a prophet you and I were so far
[48:14] gone until there was no human being in
[48:20] any form could have brought the word to
[48:26] get us straight outside of a prophet
[48:29] coming that God himself would come down
[48:33] and I don't mind saying it that brother
[48:37] branham a lot of time was speaking in
[48:39] the first person
[48:40] I don't trouble with that you know cause
[48:44] I go back with David I can go back
[48:46] Solomon they said they pierce my hands
[48:50] my faith he's speaking in the first
[48:51] person
[48:53] no trouble was saying this message is
[48:56] the Word of God but I'm straightened
[48:59] plain enough to know that the things the
[49:01] man caught that he was wrong them he
[49:03] corrected him but he didn't help to
[49:11] correct the senses of the the body in
[49:15] the senses of the second realist isn't
[49:17] it he did explain it in the anointed one
[49:20] Nicole that's the truth he said how
[49:23] would you understood Matthew 24:24
[49:26] unless you understood
[49:27] at rotten being will read that in a
[49:30] minute now would you understand false
[49:35] christs brother I said brother round
[49:39] never person the only ones in down until
[49:41] after the opening of the seals I'm not
[49:48] saying he didn't understand mankind in
[49:51] his being but I'm saying the truth that
[49:53] you knows the truth I invite you to
[49:55] follow it and find it and I've tried to
[50:02] explain that to people to get me water
[50:04] we did go that far I asked you a
[50:08] question this morning there where are
[50:11] you born again you do believe in the new
[50:15] birth don't you I mean is it you know or
[50:18] are you so south down until you can't
[50:22] say Amen I mean you do believe you need
[50:24] to be born again don't you well where
[50:31] did that body spirit show and why do you
[50:39] believe it's in the soul or why would
[50:44] you believe it's in the spirit I told
[50:49] you Church you don't listen that's not
[50:51] sarcastic the old to soul doctrine they
[50:58] laid so heavily on that you get a new
[51:02] soul and there's a doctrine come on
[51:08] later of closer related to it was
[51:11] calling a change of the soul that you
[51:13] get a new soul and some of you know the
[51:15] people personally the priest them
[51:26] what the Bible don't speak of getting a
[51:28] new soul but it does speak of getting a
[51:31] new spirit he killed 2036
[51:40] you see friend of random wouldn't show
[51:43] mixed up that's what will show he a lot
[51:47] of times in his speaking he would relate
[51:50] and he would bring that center realm
[51:53] down and he'd bring the scriptures and
[51:56] he'd bring it in to be right and he say
[51:59] so then another message later something
[52:03] he says center around his spirit he said
[52:10] but we don't need to know that we need
[52:11] to know about salvation okay were you
[52:16] born again in body spirit so explain to
[52:22] me then watch the soul when I can show
[52:26] you the Prophet says it's the spirit see
[52:32] you gotta get it right alright so let's
[52:37] think about it let's back up a little
[52:40] bit to where we were this morning though
[52:44] let's get something in this bring down
[52:47] the thoughts but what I'm doing is using
[52:49] notes for two messages okay forgive us
[52:51] if we get wrong back there because I'm
[52:53] trying to get a point let's go ahead
[52:59] with the greatest battle ever followed
[53:00] brother Joe we handed on a point and
[53:02] listing it we're gonna go from paragraph
[53:05] 104 through 110 of the greatest battle
[53:08] ever fought all right and let's let him
[53:14] say it about what happened in the garden
[53:20] and then throughout this point he will
[53:23] not be saying this is soul this is fear
[53:26] he's explaining the senses and that's
[53:29] why I chose it for that for us to read
[53:32] it so listen to it
[53:34] greatest battle ever fought 1962
[53:37] paragraph 104
[53:39] what was the matter you had to open the
[53:42] channel first you got to get the soldier
[53:44] the Holy Spirit place at the Battlefront
[53:46] they taste God's Word he is the word
[53:48] honoring that we know that we know
[53:50] that's what happened in the greatest
[53:52] battle ever fought he's explaining how
[53:54] that we fight the battle within he
[53:56] explains what happened so come on down
[53:59] and you get into the point that you
[54:01] blows things out what's the matter with
[54:03] us we're we're blowed up Christians is
[54:05] because they don't clean the channels
[54:07] out they don't get down to the inside
[54:10] you got to clean it well you got a clean
[54:12] conscience memory thoughts lay outside
[54:15] everything and coming from the inside
[54:17] out with that unadulterated Word of God
[54:19] that's the truth no matter $10,000 on
[54:22] one side trusting today trusting 10,000
[54:24] on the other side tomorrow trusting that
[54:26] has nothing to do with it cuts it down a
[54:28] reasonings I'm the one that's trusting
[54:33] can open up the channels that's what
[54:36] we're supposed to be doing now when we
[54:39] get to the statue of a perfect man you
[54:41] see us using blowing out these flus that
[54:46] are stopped up the reason God can't work
[54:49] because that's what he done with Eve he
[54:54] blocked up these channels through her
[54:59] original memory all right come on the
[55:02] devil will try to come right back if he
[55:07] can get in there at all he's got your
[55:10] army routed right then if you got you
[55:13] sense to see touch feel smell in here
[55:15] they're all right but don't trust them
[55:17] unless they agree with the word they're
[55:21] all right but if they disagree with the
[55:23] word don't you listen to them now
[55:25] imagination conscious memory reasonings
[55:28] and affections they're all right if they
[55:30] agree with the word but if your
[55:32] affection doesn't agree with the word
[55:34] get rid of it you blow flew not quit if
[55:37] you reason disagree with the word get
[55:39] away from it that's right and if your
[55:43] memory if your imaginations if your
[55:45] countenance anything differs with what's
[55:47] on that inside get rid of it
[55:51] okay come on up cause he's explaining
[55:53] the system of mankind and what's holding
[55:56] that bullet to nine we'll start here and
[55:59] then read on that your conscious has
[56:01] ever gone little words if you blower to
[56:03] clean it out and get it all out you
[56:04] holler hallelujah cause you got it all
[56:06] blow it out but what if you don't get it
[56:09] all blow down the door is your
[56:11] battleground now your battleground is
[56:13] back here at the beginning back here in
[56:16] the soul now watch him
[56:20] we're thinner back in your mind it opens
[56:24] and the mind is a gate to the soul the
[56:28] gate to the Spirit rather your mind
[56:31] opens up and accept the Spirit or
[56:34] rejects the Spirit you can have little
[56:36] consciousness of the feelings and little
[56:37] sensation all these things that has
[56:39] nothing to do with it that's just a
[56:41] smooth sensation and thing well when it
[56:44] comes to reality your mind opens up your
[56:47] mind either accept it or rejects it one
[56:50] or the other
[56:50] okay look at your next paragraph 115 the
[56:57] battle raged going to one gun the next
[57:01] the battle raged when Eve opened up her
[57:04] mind to listen to her reasoning does it
[57:08] a lot he's just explaining the mind and
[57:13] done
[57:15] that's the fluid come in that's the
[57:18] channel that run down her reasoning she
[57:20] and her soul she reasoned then you can't
[57:29] reason in yourself if you're born again
[57:32] a Christian don't reasoning so if you do
[57:39] you're not born again see he's just
[57:43] calling us old a second rim right
[57:47] the reasoning factor the first thing she
[57:51] did she opened up her mind and when she
[57:54] did human reason caught it why would
[57:57] that be a thrill what's he explaining
[58:01] he's explaining
[58:05] the memory reason conscious no matter
[58:09] what he calls it that is the rim Eve was
[58:14] deceived in that's what's bothering you
[58:20] and I today I said it and I mean it it
[58:25] don't matter if you're born again been
[58:28] born again fifty years you're still
[58:30] subject to the devil in your memory
[58:33] reason conscious of factions reasonings
[58:36] etc DARS were sin is in a Christian is
[58:43] in that room that he later called spirit
[58:47] but in the early ministry called it soul
[58:51] what does it matter what he was doing
[58:54] not even killing this one he said on
[58:57] anointed one at the end time the same
[59:00] Holy Spirit that anoints the church that
[59:02] gives them desire to save souls they
[59:05] give them power to perform miracles it
[59:08] falls on the unjust the same as the just
[59:13] the very same spirit now you can't make
[59:18] it another way and understand Mathew
[59:23] 24:24 he said thou shall be false Christ
[59:28] Valter anointed anointed with a genuine
[59:31] thing genuine thing would be false
[59:34] prophets of it false teachers false
[59:40] teachers what was the matter with Balaam
[59:47] was the matter was by them the word we
[59:54] get he's written in the word these
[59:56] prophecies endured mines not yours ain't
[1:00:05] what are you saying I'm saying Balaam
[1:00:08] was closer than we are when it comes to
[1:00:10] that realm like that because he was so
[1:00:14] anointed I like the way brother Gary
[1:00:16] Acton used to say he
[1:00:17] brother Dale if you and I are anointed
[1:00:19] we sure a lot of knowing it very much
[1:00:21] are we I said how greatly what about the
[1:00:27] devil being closer to the truth than you
[1:00:29] are now I didn't say you've lost I
[1:00:32] didn't have nothing in mine and no
[1:00:34] thoughts of telling the truth
[1:00:39] those prophets never had the new birth
[1:00:42] we'll get to that but yet they had the
[1:00:47] Word of God even the first person but me
[1:00:52] and you listen I didn't give him this
[1:00:58] one either
[1:00:59] we've spoken words a regional seed
[1:01:03] paragraph 182 183
[1:01:07] that's how adult for his committed
[1:01:09] spiritually when you knowing better by
[1:01:12] the Word of God by the end of course of
[1:01:14] the mind taking a lie of the devil
[1:01:15] against the Word of God that's exactly
[1:01:18] what he had done with a spiritual
[1:01:20] intercourse first that come by
[1:01:23] disbelieving Satan's lie into the wound
[1:01:26] of her mind and polluted her soul set
[1:01:38] death in the soul then the natural act
[1:01:41] took place that's the only way a woman
[1:01:46] could ever commit adultery after has let
[1:01:48] some slicker talk him into it well he
[1:01:51] calls it solo life at 62 remember up to
[1:01:58] that point he was covering soul as being
[1:02:06] the second rim with mankind memory
[1:02:10] reason conscious in affections church on
[1:02:18] this way I know I'm human I'm sorry
[1:02:21] sometimes it makes you feel like just
[1:02:24] folding your arms and walk away
[1:02:30] and say 40 years I've tried to get you
[1:02:34] to see the truth
[1:02:37] that's your prophet was not Almighty God
[1:02:43] he said things and done things that was
[1:02:46] not right
[1:02:47] yet he was God's prophet as I said well
[1:02:50] ago that spoken the first person to
[1:02:54] bring us the Word of God and nobody else
[1:02:57] could have been chosen to have done it
[1:02:59] I don't care spiritual you think you are
[1:03:02] or I think I am it would have not worked
[1:03:07] they yet to know and realize I can take
[1:03:11] brother runs message and preach a line
[1:03:12] to you that you're born again in your
[1:03:14] spirit show it from quotes show it from
[1:03:22] the scripture I can take the prophets
[1:03:24] message and show you're born again in
[1:03:26] your soul
[1:03:26] and show it from the scriptures and the
[1:03:29] quotes but people don't want to know
[1:03:37] they think you're an intellect they
[1:03:39] think you're too deep too deep for what
[1:03:42] trying to learn the difference between
[1:03:44] soul and spirit to try to find a place
[1:03:46] where we were born to get out and like I
[1:03:55] said you go back and check and see
[1:03:59] you'll find all of your denominations
[1:04:05] preach teach their doctrinal point in
[1:04:10] its body so in spirit
[1:04:16] Scofield says that
[1:04:24] do you want to go with that or you want
[1:04:26] to go with the truth that a prophet went
[1:04:29] along with that
[1:04:32] what brother branham don't go along with
[1:04:34] brother Dale yeah well I remember when
[1:04:36] he told one time that love was the
[1:04:40] evidence of the Holy Ghost and he said
[1:04:41] that was a good point and said I went
[1:04:43] along with it so don't quote to me see
[1:04:56] but think about it was Eve deceived in
[1:05:02] her soul or deceived in her spirit if
[1:05:09] she did have eternal life as I
[1:05:13] proclaimed away with Adam having eternal
[1:05:16] life breathed into his nostrils
[1:05:18] she got breathed into somewhere and she
[1:05:21] got eternal life in her soul then how
[1:05:24] could it be her soul that went wrong you
[1:05:29] said but I just don't see how you can I
[1:05:30] don't see how you can have eternal life
[1:05:32] you tell me how the church fell it and I
[1:05:39] see yeah you tell me how the true bride
[1:05:43] of Christ wound up and I see you you
[1:05:45] tell me how the true Bride of Christ
[1:05:47] fault the truth the winner Zeus's streak
[1:05:53] came out it was Trinitarians about
[1:05:59] somewhere around 1912 but in there the
[1:06:03] one that's developed bringing truth back
[1:06:06] you know what the originators from Azusa
[1:06:10] Street done someone went along with it
[1:06:14] some of them throw Rotten Tomatoes and
[1:06:17] those who believe the change ain't never
[1:06:24] said none of them's going to hell that's
[1:06:26] where you put it in there and you're
[1:06:27] wrong and say until this message come
[1:06:32] along we were all deceived
[1:06:35] and still are until this message
[1:06:38] listen it's revealed not because brother
[1:06:41] Brown said it but when it's revealed
[1:06:46] what he said and why said it that away
[1:06:54] then we're still deceived
[1:06:56] I mean hurry all right let's go to
[1:06:59] number one this would have been an
[1:07:01] afternoon message called the inside
[1:07:04] we'll pick it up later call this we're
[1:07:06] just apart to read the message called
[1:07:09] ensign 1962 the outside is the body
[1:07:16] there's five gates to that body and
[1:07:18] that's the five senses of course he
[1:07:20] takes filled smelling here the inside
[1:07:22] like the seed that's planted the inside
[1:07:25] of that is the pulp lack of the seed
[1:07:29] which is the sole the rim there's five
[1:07:34] gates to that you enter into conscious
[1:07:37] and memory so forth but then send inside
[1:07:39] of that little compartment is the third
[1:07:42] compartment which is the spirit now
[1:07:45] what's the explaining body so spirit but
[1:07:50] what's he giving five senses to the body
[1:07:52] five senses to the second realm one
[1:07:55] sense for the sinner right okay read all
[1:07:59] you want to okay go ahead
[1:08:04] paragraph fifty-eight dispute there's
[1:08:07] only one Avenue a little bit 434 is it
[1:08:11] and that's what controls the rest of it
[1:08:14] there's only one having you through that
[1:08:15] that's self wheel there were self will
[1:08:19] she soul or the sinner the sender let's
[1:08:22] call it the center rim to where you hold
[1:08:25] to the point the center realm of mankind
[1:08:27] is the Ceph wheel and because that's
[1:08:31] where you make your choice
[1:08:32] oh no I made my choice of a spirit
[1:08:34] that's what went wrong did you get that
[1:08:37] one there's only one having you through
[1:08:41] that and that's that wheel you can
[1:08:42] accept or turn away and that's the only
[1:08:44] Avenue that if you accept the will of
[1:08:47] God through that spirit
[1:08:49] said oh really told me God spirit takes
[1:08:52] his place in your heart and controls the
[1:08:57] rest of you if you do not accept that
[1:09:00] then the enemy takes that spot and
[1:09:02] controls the rest of you so it lays in
[1:09:06] there a man being made up in that
[1:09:10] fashion then he gives him the something
[1:09:13] inside of him that makes him want to
[1:09:15] achieve something by himself he's trying
[1:09:20] to do something to save himself he wants
[1:09:23] to get out of it but he wants to do it
[1:09:25] himself
[1:09:27] are you listening he wants to make his
[1:09:30] own way about it about it what about it
[1:09:35] what about the next one of Lexington's
[1:09:39] Jesus Christ
[1:09:40] the first throne is in heaven judgment
[1:09:42] see the second throne was in Christ
[1:09:45] the third throne is in man now he's
[1:09:47] explaining it he drops down so come on
[1:09:49] up and then he gets now what is a man
[1:09:52] he's a triune being body soul and spirit
[1:09:55] this is 61
[1:10:00] how many knows that God's approach what
[1:10:04] is his heart you remember my message God
[1:10:07] chose a man's heart for his control
[1:10:10] power the devil chose his head for his
[1:10:14] control tower and he makes him see
[1:10:18] things look through his eyes but if God
[1:10:21] in his heart makes him believe things
[1:10:23] that he cannot see did he see God his
[1:10:27] own that is in the heart in the heart of
[1:10:30] a man is a trial is the throne of God
[1:10:32] you get it man God made his throne in
[1:10:36] the heart of man now what's the heart of
[1:10:38] man center of man right what do you want
[1:10:41] call it spirit or do you want to call it
[1:10:43] so it's the center am the heart will
[1:10:46] read that in just a minute in case you
[1:10:47] won't do later all right
[1:10:49] he makes him the throne all right now
[1:10:53] watch watch the first part of the man
[1:10:55] the first part of the man is body the
[1:10:58] next part is his soul which is the
[1:11:01] nature
[1:11:02] his spirit that makes him what he is he
[1:11:06] approaches that now Raul no no okay
[1:11:14] thanks your spirit that makes him what
[1:11:16] he is he approaches that now the third
[1:11:19] part of the man is his spirit and his
[1:11:21] spirit is the center of his heart okay
[1:11:24] in the center of the heart is where God
[1:11:27] comes for the throne okay what do you
[1:11:31] want to call the spirit what you want to
[1:11:33] call it so it's the center its yard as a
[1:11:37] man believed within his art so easy that
[1:11:39] scripture was he just showing you what
[1:11:45] he taught in one part then we'll get to
[1:11:46] the last part I hope going to the next
[1:11:50] one the greatest battle ever fought this
[1:11:59] is not the one want to go now
[1:12:00] all right he's talking about looking at
[1:12:05] my notes and things that he's rolled out
[1:12:06] and remember he drawled human being a
[1:12:08] seed physical seed he talks about the
[1:12:11] eggs the blood you read it off we'll
[1:12:12] come on down to about here in the child
[1:12:16] any seed has a sale on the outside the
[1:12:19] inside is Pope the inside of the Pope is
[1:12:21] their journey of life right see the pulp
[1:12:24] is not the seed the shell of an egg puff
[1:12:30] insider or you Connor - we don't - and
[1:12:32] then there's a germ of life
[1:12:34] okay so we're yet Jeremiah well that's
[1:12:36] the way we're made we're body soul and
[1:12:38] spirit the outside the body the cell the
[1:12:42] inside of that the conscious and so
[1:12:44] forth is the soul and inside the soul is
[1:12:48] the spirit and the spirit governs all
[1:12:51] the other so he's still teaching a lot
[1:12:54] body so spirit now if you sit down and
[1:12:59] you draw these little reigns you'll find
[1:13:01] out outside body has five senses it's
[1:13:03] contacted by that cj's fields melon ear
[1:13:06] that's the five senses that control the
[1:13:08] human body inside the body is a soul and
[1:13:11] that's console is controlled by
[1:13:13] imaginations conscious memory
[1:13:16] reason and affection that's the thing
[1:13:18] that controls the soul so now watch they
[1:13:21] teach body so spirit but the spirit is
[1:13:29] only has one sense you're truly a
[1:13:35] Christian or anybody has one sense
[1:13:37] you're either believer an unbeliever
[1:13:41] you're either born again or you're not
[1:13:44] one again well I'm in the stages don't
[1:13:46] philosophy me don't throw things back
[1:13:49] you say I'm in the stages of being born
[1:13:52] again that doesn't mean you're born
[1:13:54] again I don't care how long you stay in
[1:13:58] justification that don't let you and the
[1:14:00] born-again experience be a good person
[1:14:04] with the spirit only has one sense the
[1:14:08] spirit well let's get it the spirit has
[1:14:10] one sin and that sense is either
[1:14:12] dominates it is faith or doubt that's it
[1:14:15] exactly and there's only one attitude to
[1:14:18] it
[1:14:18] that's very moral agency you tell me you
[1:14:21] don't believe free moral agency for the
[1:14:23] Bride of Christ you remember that the
[1:14:24] other day you think I'm hollering at
[1:14:26] people the greatest doctrines of the
[1:14:29] peoples this message they don't believe
[1:14:30] in free moral agency go ask them they
[1:14:35] said they bribed don't have a choice God
[1:14:37] chose her now he just said there was the
[1:14:42] only Avenue in come true because you
[1:14:44] can't accept doubt no you can't accept
[1:14:48] out or you can accept faith either one
[1:14:50] you want to work on now for Satan begin
[1:14:54] at the principle part the cause the
[1:14:56] spirit of man to doubt God's Word once
[1:14:59] you God begin it to press them apart to
[1:15:03] lay his word in that spirit there you
[1:15:05] are and that's what does it
[1:15:08] yeah and watching by just brought this
[1:15:12] 156 brother branham's preached a lot of
[1:15:17] things and he had it right it was just
[1:15:23] his wording sometimes
[1:15:28] but remember it was right
[1:15:37] body five senses second trim five senses
[1:15:41] third room one sense he was always right
[1:15:46] look how he is here in 1956 now on the
[1:15:50] Intervale you talking about an
[1:15:53] intellectual faith and he said then
[1:15:56] there's a faith that comes from the
[1:15:57] heart we're gonna get onto that on
[1:15:59] salvation okay
[1:16:00] this man was telling him years ago as a
[1:16:03] man thanking his heart he's that's crazy
[1:16:04] cuz they ain't nothing in there look
[1:16:06] right down in the heart in the center of
[1:16:08] the heart there's a little compartment
[1:16:10] where there's not even a blood sale in
[1:16:13] it it's not in the animal heart only in
[1:16:16] the human heart they say it's the
[1:16:17] occupation are the occupant of the soul
[1:16:21] the soul lives in the heart then after
[1:16:24] all God was right when he said a man
[1:16:26] thinketh in his heart now he's saying he
[1:16:29] stole is the heart in these reindeer
[1:16:33] honor huh miss Leavey I don't go to was
[1:16:40] fixin to use it but see as the word
[1:16:43] begin to unfold to the Prophet God began
[1:16:49] to reveal the word to him you agree he
[1:16:55] began to reveal the things and even
[1:17:00] likewise writer that he himself priest
[1:17:03] wrong now I invite you to do one thing I
[1:17:08] invite you in the church book we tell me
[1:17:11] I invite you to do one thing you ever
[1:17:19] heard the prophets say God can't like
[1:17:21] ain't do wrong how about going sometime
[1:17:27] and run this in your computer to see
[1:17:33] about one time put your account in your
[1:17:39] computer if you need some way I'll happy
[1:17:41] to it
[1:17:44] then when a prophet says something and
[1:17:47] God comes behind and vindicates it you
[1:17:54] better believe it is that scripture why
[1:17:59] because God is using him okay
[1:18:06] go look it up sometimes like this and
[1:18:10] see if brother Branham wouldn't say some
[1:18:14] things and say it's thus saith the Lord
[1:18:17] Oh any time he says that you better go
[1:18:25] check your quotes you're gonna find some
[1:18:30] places in there when he was teaching the
[1:18:33] white horse rider as the Holy Spirit
[1:18:39] then he tells you that that's thus saith
[1:18:41] the Lord he said well I won't that quote
[1:18:45] alright he's telling you it's the truth
[1:18:49] maybe not used the word thus saith the
[1:18:52] Lord but he's telling you the truth and
[1:18:54] watch this one if you ever noticed thing
[1:18:57] when he would be teaching and he'd say
[1:18:59] if I've talked to you the truth tonight
[1:19:02] let the Holy Spirit come down and
[1:19:05] vindicate it and the Holy Spirit come
[1:19:07] down and vindicate was he vindicating it
[1:19:13] wrong that the white horse rider was the
[1:19:16] Holy Spirit oh you're you're I agree
[1:19:23] with you but I read I wish you would and
[1:19:25] survived listening that like I said one
[1:19:28] time there's a certain church and I said
[1:19:30] something this brother he said he didn't
[1:19:33] say that I said he's no gettin I just
[1:19:39] listened to the tape I can't help it
[1:19:46] this is what he said he didn't say that
[1:19:47] you know what I had the next time the
[1:19:50] book you know what I done I filled it
[1:19:52] open and said with brother would you
[1:19:54] mind reading that
[1:19:56] and he read it he said I listened to the
[1:19:59] type and didn't get it so you say well I
[1:20:05] don't if that you just go check it out
[1:20:08] under the years he was saying the white
[1:20:10] horse rider was the Holy Spirit the Holy
[1:20:14] Spirit was coming down to indicating in
[1:20:16] to be teaching the truth you ought to
[1:20:23] wake up
[1:20:24] especially you preachers and start
[1:20:28] reading and listening bless God I don't
[1:20:34] have to listen to you brother Dale hey
[1:20:36] man
[1:20:38] but if it's the truth you're gonna be
[1:20:41] judged by it same for me listening to
[1:20:47] you just check and say that woody would
[1:20:53] be a little alpha what he would be
[1:20:54] saying but yet the Holy Spirit would
[1:20:57] come and indicated what's he done he
[1:21:00] wasn't vindicating the era he was
[1:21:04] vindicating the man then you want this
[1:21:08] quote right around sitting and doing
[1:21:10] that vindicated in the man you want
[1:21:12] isn't he said that's why when that
[1:21:14] prophet cursed them Hebrew children and
[1:21:19] the buyers killed 42 of them
[1:21:21] he said that was not the Holy Spirit we
[1:21:28] said it was the power of the Prophet
[1:21:33] come on are we still in the message or
[1:21:39] are we playing Pat it around with little
[1:21:41] you know ideas and doctrines what about
[1:21:46] it
[1:21:46] I know I'm running late ain't gonna be
[1:21:49] able to get through I'll finish this
[1:21:50] Wednesday no problem with me
[1:21:52] but I do want to get down to this I do
[1:21:56] want it made plain and public cut all
[1:21:59] the way down for 40 or something years
[1:22:01] they brought around in his early
[1:22:03] ministry basically tall body so scary
[1:22:08] sixty-five uh he talked body spirit and
[1:22:13] soul and that was the only way you can
[1:22:18] understand anointing ones come on body
[1:22:31] oldest part of me so spirit where would
[1:22:37] be the anointing you think there's not a
[1:22:42] wrong in that part where would be the
[1:22:43] anointing come on wake up body soul
[1:22:52] spirit the new anointing would be in the
[1:22:55] soul or the center center of man but if
[1:23:00] you place it body spirit and soul then
[1:23:04] the soul can be truly born again and the
[1:23:07] anointing can be on your spirit realm
[1:23:10] now you got the truth he says now you
[1:23:17] can understand Matthew 24:24
[1:23:20] now you can understand this is me
[1:23:22] quoting now you can understand the new
[1:23:24] birth and notice you're born again in
[1:23:29] your center room that's the soul of
[1:23:34] mankind
[1:23:35] and the spirit can anoint your spirit
[1:23:38] now here's one you ain't gonna like okay
[1:23:42] so wake it up is there any difference in
[1:23:45] their knowing it comes on you and your
[1:23:47] knowing it comes on ninety-one and we
[1:23:55] put the devil out of the way okay you
[1:23:56] leave him out of this okay
[1:23:59] don't claim to tell my know anyone's
[1:24:01] isn't known to the devil but around us
[1:24:03] and we're gonna read it if you're
[1:24:05] knowing it with a genuine baptism of the
[1:24:08] Holy Spirit so what is the new birth
[1:24:15] body has nothing to do other than it
[1:24:17] goes along and see face it hears things
[1:24:22] the Spirit of God now everybody
[1:24:27] born-again believers talking to you the
[1:24:31] Spirit comes and anoint your spirit and
[1:24:36] takes you through the stages of
[1:24:40] cleansing the soul of justification and
[1:24:44] sanctification and inputs the life in it
[1:24:53] is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:01] it's a different act from the new birth
[1:25:08] I'm quoting brother Branham but you
[1:25:12] don't want it that way what are you
[1:25:15] saying there's no difference in a true
[1:25:21] born-again Christian the anointing is up
[1:25:23] on their spirit a person that is an
[1:25:26] anointed one you know false on the
[1:25:28] inside the same Holy Spirit is anointing
[1:25:31] their spirit the only difference is
[1:25:33] what's on the inside that's the only
[1:25:38] difference is what's the controlling
[1:25:40] from the inside factor now you better
[1:25:42] get your senses right because then
[1:25:46] brother Branham never changed he always
[1:25:48] put five cents to the body five cents to
[1:25:50] the second trim one cents to this inner
[1:25:52] realm no matter what he called it it's
[1:25:56] always the same that way you can
[1:26:01] understand anointed ones that is the
[1:26:05] genuine anointing come on
[1:26:09] let's say just a few and then we'll go
[1:26:12] all right go ahead to number five
[1:26:15] brother which is the god of this evil
[1:26:19] age priest in 1965 801 the outside man
[1:26:28] is a physical being which is controlled
[1:26:29] by six senses our five senses brother
[1:26:33] the inside man
[1:26:35] is a spirit man which is controlled by
[1:26:38] five senses conscience the love and so
[1:26:41] forth the outside man see taste feels
[1:26:44] melting here but the inside of that
[1:26:46] spirit another spirits got the five
[1:26:49] senses man we're either gone but the
[1:26:53] inside of that spirit is the soul and
[1:26:58] it's controlled by one thing you
[1:27:00] remember a while ago the one that even
[1:27:02] he was giving us in a room and making it
[1:27:04] to spirit he still say it you see their
[1:27:07] faith or doubt
[1:27:08] so his doctrine is right I'll tell you
[1:27:13] what you can take this as something for
[1:27:14] me I believe God done this purposely to
[1:27:18] blind most of the people and it's done a
[1:27:23] good job
[1:27:30] now listen but the inside of that spirit
[1:27:32] is a soul it's controlled by one thing
[1:27:35] your freewill you can accept what the
[1:27:37] devil says or accept what God says and
[1:27:39] that'll determine what spirit is in
[1:27:42] there now he's coming back talking about
[1:27:44] the spirit image the Spirit of God it'll
[1:27:48] feed on the things of God it won't feed
[1:27:51] on anything in the world any talking
[1:27:52] about the inside of you so if you love
[1:27:57] the world and things of the world
[1:27:58] because the love of God has not entered
[1:28:02] into this inner part Satan has deceived
[1:28:04] you and men shall not live by bread
[1:28:07] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:28:09] out of the mouth of God he said Satan
[1:28:13] has deceived you go ahead number six
[1:28:17] rapture paragraph 144 looky here
[1:28:23] you're a triune being you're inside this
[1:28:26] little fella here is the soul the next
[1:28:28] is the spirit and the next is the body
[1:28:30] what's he coming inside outside okay now
[1:28:35] you got five senses in this body to
[1:28:37] contact your earthly home you don't
[1:28:38] contact the rest of it the rest of it
[1:28:42] you got five senses of the Spirit here
[1:28:44] love and conscience and so forth of that
[1:28:47] but in here is where you live
[1:28:49] that's what you are let me get the one
[1:28:57] who won't yeah okay
[1:28:59] continue on with the rapture because
[1:29:02] it's spring that just bring it up when
[1:29:04] you read it in between but bring it
[1:29:06] about he's talking about the cocklebur
[1:29:07] how they can be anointed now bringing on
[1:29:09] the in 47 paragraph 147 known the Bible
[1:29:15] say in the last days that there shall be
[1:29:16] false Christ's congregation says Amen
[1:29:18] not false Jesus is now false Christ
[1:29:21] anointed ones falsely anointed to the
[1:29:24] word denominational anointed but not to
[1:29:27] the word and the world will by record of
[1:29:29] itself they don't need nothing else
[1:29:31] it'll by record of itself and that will
[1:29:33] fall come fall so knowing did once you
[1:29:36] got my tape on that and the if you call
[1:29:39] one of them say oh you are Jesus
[1:29:42] certainly not they wouldn't stand for
[1:29:44] that come on up
[1:29:45] save reading Missy stop 140 very minute
[1:29:52] stopping 148 yeah but when it comes to
[1:29:55] an O Lord I got to anointing listen and
[1:29:59] it's a genuine anointing remember
[1:30:07] Caiaphas had it - and prophesy
[1:30:10] so did Balaam have it and promised that
[1:30:12] but that don't have nothing to do with
[1:30:15] this inside there's nothing to do with
[1:30:18] instra unless that was God's seed his
[1:30:22] gene from the beginning predestinated
[1:30:25] you're finished I don't care how much
[1:30:27] you shout speak with tongue run shout
[1:30:29] that has nothing to do it a Coco Birkin
[1:30:32] count just as much as any of the rest of
[1:30:34] them I've seen heaters race out and
[1:30:36] speaking tongues and drink blood out of
[1:30:38] a human's go and call on the devil so
[1:30:41] you don't any of them sensations and
[1:30:43] they forget it it's your heart in that
[1:30:45] word and that's Christ bring in Dar and
[1:30:51] watch it make itself known just as it
[1:30:54] opens up like any other seed and the
[1:30:57] part itself for the age that you're
[1:30:58] living okay number seven and North it
[1:31:02] not
[1:31:05] the inside of that spirit inside that is
[1:31:09] a spirit which you become when you're
[1:31:11] born into the earth and breathed the
[1:31:13] breath of life into him off his
[1:31:15] breathing in that spirit of a world in
[1:31:18] nature is of aura because it watch that
[1:31:21] was not given from God who get to this
[1:31:23] on the redemptive part look that nature
[1:31:26] wasn't given of God in the wrong way
[1:31:28] read what he's saying that spirit is of
[1:31:32] a world in nature because it was not
[1:31:34] given him God from God but it was given
[1:31:37] permitted by God now you got that every
[1:31:42] child that's born in the world is born
[1:31:43] in sin saving iniquity in the world
[1:31:45] speaking live that's right that so that
[1:31:47] person inside there is a sinner to begin
[1:31:49] with that's where we're all now it's got
[1:31:53] five intimates and five endless I don't
[1:31:57] know whether I can call them right off
[1:31:58] now when the person though is still
[1:32:00] conscious and loving choice no
[1:32:03] conscience loves reason there's five
[1:32:05] inlets to the Spirit you can't think
[1:32:08] with your body you have to think with
[1:32:10] your spirit you can't have conscience in
[1:32:12] your body it has no mental faculties of
[1:32:15] all your body does so you have to think
[1:32:17] with your spirit
[1:32:18] you have to reason you can't reason with
[1:32:20] your physical being called reason does
[1:32:23] we'll see touch feel smell in here
[1:32:24] reason is what you can make in your mind
[1:32:28] now listen to this if you're asleep or
[1:32:32] you're out your body is lying there dead
[1:32:37] now not not you died listen to it it
[1:32:41] just means lifeless it's not working but
[1:32:44] your spirit can still reason twenty how
[1:32:47] dreams it's put it's that much money out
[1:32:51] dreams and then he says your spirit can
[1:32:54] still reason he's going to sleep there's
[1:32:57] five senses that control that inside man
[1:32:59] now to the last man which is so there's
[1:33:02] only one sense that controls that and
[1:33:04] that is free moral agency free agency
[1:33:08] free will to choose are to reject any
[1:33:12] modern events make clear what prophecy
[1:33:16] I'm gonna give you one they'll choke you
[1:33:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean
[1:33:21] you're going in not at all
[1:33:24] not only that don't have anything to do
[1:33:26] with your soul here's the inside soul in
[1:33:35] here that has to come from God but then
[1:33:38] on the outside you have five senses and
[1:33:39] fie inlets to your contact your earthly
[1:33:42] home the inside you have a spirit and
[1:33:45] there you have five outlets your
[1:33:48] conscience and love and so forth five
[1:33:50] outlets to that spirit remember in that
[1:33:52] spirit remember in that spirit reasoning
[1:34:00] conscious affections he just explained
[1:34:03] it right remember in that spirit you can
[1:34:07] be baptized with a genuine spirit of God
[1:34:10] and still be lost it's the soul that
[1:34:16] lives that was ordained of God didn't
[1:34:20] Jesus say many will come to me in that
[1:34:21] day and say Lord having I cast out
[1:34:23] Devils none great and mighty works
[1:34:25] prophesied the great gifts of God he
[1:34:28] said depart from me you worker of
[1:34:30] iniquity and never knew you okay gonna
[1:34:34] remember what he said though in that
[1:34:36] spirit so now we know the truth you
[1:34:39] realize when we first heard these things
[1:34:41] in 1970 when I first heard at 68 69 and
[1:34:46] they say you can have the baptism with
[1:34:48] Holy Ghost everyday that I'm dying or L
[1:34:51] lost hope for anybody till somebody
[1:34:57] found the point because until they found
[1:35:00] the point it was just statements well I
[1:35:02] think it's this well I think he's that I
[1:35:04] think he's dead I was dire and one day a
[1:35:09] man come up and he found that one that
[1:35:11] we just read what was it modern events
[1:35:13] made clear by prophecy that we just read
[1:35:15] he's in that spirit you can be anointed
[1:35:20] now listen you can say I got the baptism
[1:35:25] with Holy Ghost
[1:35:26] I'm going to heaven that don't
[1:35:29] one thing that you're going to heaven no
[1:35:34] sir
[1:35:38] you can have the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:40] Spirit every day of your life and still
[1:35:44] be lost and go to hell the Bible says
[1:35:48] now he's explaining it where's the
[1:35:51] baptism following anointing on your
[1:35:55] spirit cuz he's gonna look here you're
[1:35:56] an outside person your five senses of
[1:35:58] contact outside body God gave you five
[1:36:01] senses not to contact him directly home
[1:36:04] she takes the smell in here then you
[1:36:06] have a spirit on the inside of that and
[1:36:07] it has five outlets conscious and love
[1:36:09] and so forth five outlets and lets you
[1:36:11] contact the spirit world with that but
[1:36:14] with your spirit your physical contacts
[1:36:17] of physical your spiritual contacts are
[1:36:20] spiritual but inside of that you got a
[1:36:22] soul and that soul is that gene that
[1:36:24] comes from God keep on going thinking
[1:36:28] man's filter it's brain only up until we
[1:36:32] get to the point this is thinking man's
[1:36:34] filter as I spoke this morning like
[1:36:36] Sunday morning on that wheel in the
[1:36:39] middle of the wheel or that little
[1:36:41] inside sole on the inside of the spirit
[1:36:47] have that spirit on the outside between
[1:36:50] the soul in the body now that spirit
[1:36:54] then we got two times we can pull that
[1:36:57] up let you see it everybody whatever
[1:36:59] look have that spirit on the outside not
[1:37:06] out where did that between the soul and
[1:37:09] the body okay can be absolutely anointed
[1:37:15] with the Holy Ghost did you understand
[1:37:17] that now the father of that in your
[1:37:19] continuity to the message the god of
[1:37:22] this world didn't only once in the last
[1:37:24] day that outside that middle circle
[1:37:27] first circle is the human senses second
[1:37:31] sixth circle is the spirit senses will
[1:37:36] save will desire and so forth but the
[1:37:38] inside is the soul and that soul was
[1:37:42] predestined
[1:37:43] so they can anoint this spirit to make
[1:37:47] the outside body come in subjection what
[1:37:52] you know they want preachers done but
[1:37:55] the soul that sinneth that soldier that
[1:37:56] the soul that rejects an unbelief the
[1:37:59] Word of God which is the part of it
[1:38:01] that's so silly eternally go ahead what
[1:38:04] we got you got another one anointed ones
[1:38:09] it's in ten we're on number 11
[1:38:14] okay now someone might say to me do you
[1:38:18] believe that that anointing on those
[1:38:19] people means and it's the anointing of
[1:38:21] the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine the
[1:38:24] Holy Spirit of God upon a person and yet
[1:38:27] they're false
[1:38:31] listen close and see what he said and
[1:38:33] they share so signs and wonders in so
[1:38:35] much than it would to see their very
[1:38:37] elect if it were possible and they are
[1:38:39] anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit
[1:38:41] trying to do God a service trying to get
[1:38:43] to it it's impossible a man or woman
[1:38:49] without sincerity and listen read isint
[1:38:52] carefully check it is it possible a man
[1:38:57] woman with all sincerity trying their
[1:39:01] best to do God a service and stirred it
[1:39:05] in the wrong way listen with a genuine
[1:39:10] anointing of the Holy Spirit upon them
[1:39:15] but sturdy contrary the God's plan for
[1:39:19] the age and chaos the whole thing he's
[1:39:27] not going no body out because they don't
[1:39:29] believe the word he's putting it in
[1:39:34] right over there okay well we got
[1:39:35] thirteen come on back to the rapture but
[1:39:42] when it comes to our own glory I got the
[1:39:44] anointing that we read that did we read
[1:39:50] that one okay
[1:39:53] when it comes to an older I got the
[1:39:55] anointing
[1:39:56] and it's the genuine anointing remember
[1:39:58] Caiaphas headed to and prophesied so did
[1:40:00] Balaam avidin prophesy but that don't
[1:40:02] have nothing to do with this inside
[1:40:04] unless that was God's seed he's James
[1:40:07] from the beginning predestinated you're
[1:40:09] finished I don't care how much you shall
[1:40:11] speak with tongue run shout that has
[1:40:13] nothing to do with it
[1:40:15] we're coming back - okay we're on number
[1:40:17] 14 I think that's the last one we find
[1:40:20] that this evil ages to prove to Satan
[1:40:22] she's not like Eve and she is not that
[1:40:26] type of a woman and she will be tried by
[1:40:28] his word the bride is Adams bride was
[1:40:33] tried by the word and Adams bride
[1:40:35] believed every bit of the world over
[1:40:37] confused on one promise that he's the
[1:40:39] same yesterday today and forever today
[1:40:43] see but failed on one promise under the
[1:40:45] temptation of the enemy face to face and
[1:40:48] the people that's called for his name of
[1:40:50] course is his bride she used to come in
[1:40:52] contact again by the same thing not by
[1:40:57] just denominational truth or something
[1:41:00] but every word what is the last one nice
[1:41:10] when is the scripture from Deuteronomy
[1:41:14] if there rise among you a prophet or a
[1:41:17] dreamer of dreams and give you a sign go
[1:41:19] under and the sign of the wonder come to
[1:41:21] pass you realize what that means I'm
[1:41:26] gonna come in here and said now they're
[1:41:27] going so it's gonna happen this is gonna
[1:41:28] happen that's going out and you know
[1:41:30] whatever you could think detected okay
[1:41:32] and it happens what are you gonna do
[1:41:39] right then what are you gonna do
[1:41:41] somebody comes in here and says I've
[1:41:43] come to tell you all the truth and to
[1:41:46] prove that what I believe about William
[1:41:49] Branham being wrong God's gonna come and
[1:41:53] raise the dead it's a glory hallelujah
[1:42:00] you say what do you mean that far oh we
[1:42:02] gonna get somebody raised in the day
[1:42:04] somebody that was dead zone bit right
[1:42:06] you say you're stupid I'll agree with
[1:42:09] you want
[1:42:11] but I love it you know why say I'm the
[1:42:14] guy what are you gonna do if they come
[1:42:16] in here one day and walk up with a box
[1:42:18] and say if you believe what you believe
[1:42:20] take your snake out what are you gonna
[1:42:27] do when I tell you what now I'll take it
[1:42:32] up with a hoe you're making stupid
[1:42:34] mistakes that it's not in the will of
[1:42:37] God I've got if nothing else to put my
[1:42:42] life on the line to do it you said will
[1:42:46] you do it when he comes we'll see I
[1:42:48] didn't say where I said when it counted
[1:42:50] we'll say but I ain't gonna be stupid
[1:42:52] enough to tell him I'll take it up with
[1:42:53] a hoe
[1:42:54] oh that's no he's tempting the devil
[1:43:00] then remember if he's tempting the devil
[1:43:03] he's challenging you are you willing to
[1:43:06] put your life on the line for what you
[1:43:08] believe okay
[1:43:12] what if he gives you a sign that come
[1:43:14] device now here's what we got to know
[1:43:16] the word he gives you a sign it comes to
[1:43:20] bite I'll give you another scripture
[1:43:20] I'll give you a scripture Oh from right
[1:43:24] there up that tells you the same thing
[1:43:28] it tells you or if a prophet comes and
[1:43:31] preaches the truth you kind of believe
[1:43:33] that prophet think of it in a minute but
[1:43:36] it's starting the scripture maybe
[1:43:38] somebody can help me but they send this
[1:43:40] creature you've got to believe him
[1:43:42] because it's God's prophet but here what
[1:43:46] does it say and the signer wonder come
[1:43:48] to Pais were of the spike under the
[1:43:50] saying let us go after other gods which
[1:43:56] thou has not known and let us serve to
[1:43:59] him thou shalt not hearken unto the
[1:44:04] words of that prophet or that dreamer of
[1:44:06] dreams we won't get down there far
[1:44:11] enough to read it but that dreamer of
[1:44:13] Dreams is supposed to be put to death
[1:44:15] it's the same scripture that's not not
[1:44:19] hearken unto the words of that prophet
[1:44:21] or that dreamer of dreams listen
[1:44:23] for the Lord prove it you to do what to
[1:44:29] know whether you love the Lord your God
[1:44:31] with all your heart and all your soul
[1:44:36] what about Abraham as I said this
[1:44:38] morning
[1:44:39] take your only son how it'll kill him
[1:44:43] how about it what would you say
[1:44:47] he said he let them things come among us
[1:44:50] to prove it we just read from the
[1:44:53] Prophet that this bride is going to
[1:44:56] stand on the word he said I don't
[1:44:59] understand him maybe new ones and things
[1:45:02] and saying I don't understand God I
[1:45:04] always thought that the baptism of the
[1:45:06] Holy Ghost was the new birth it is yes
[1:45:09] it is it is the baptism of the Holy
[1:45:15] Spirit
[1:45:15] can't just anoint your spirit because
[1:45:19] that's what it does what is the new
[1:45:22] birth the new birth is not your shouting
[1:45:26] your doings in all is a rock the new
[1:45:29] birth is the word made alive in your
[1:45:33] soul the anointing is the same anointing
[1:45:39] on you as it is on the others Karthus
[1:45:46] student prophesied and said two things
[1:45:50] his weight was bringing out the other
[1:45:51] day and John looked at him and seen the
[1:45:54] anointing come on him but he seen him
[1:45:56] going off but one day he saw it come
[1:46:02] down you say oh that's later that's not
[1:46:04] just oh you ain't getting the point when
[1:46:09] he's seen that anointing come and stay
[1:46:11] on the Lord Jesus he proclaimed him to
[1:46:13] be the Lamb of God he didn't matter how
[1:46:16] much it come on he went off there's no
[1:46:18] problem it was whether or not that man
[1:46:23] would stay with the word
[1:46:30] well brother so-and-so is preaching that
[1:46:33] there's really two Lords and he's got
[1:46:37] great signs and wonders fathering him
[1:46:39] praise the Lord
[1:46:41] seek her getting healed today to being
[1:46:43] right praise the Lord God's doing it the
[1:46:48] devil can't do it so the gods using it
[1:46:51] so we praise the Lord people are getting
[1:46:53] sick they only getting healed in a sec
[1:46:56] thank you lord
[1:47:00] yeah but he says brother Brandon was
[1:47:02] wrong right just say forget it I'm too
[1:47:10] far up the road to say that the man has
[1:47:16] brought me this far like brother dick
[1:47:17] says we talk a lot about if they told me
[1:47:20] that brother Branham was married 10
[1:47:21] times I'll quote it for me he said 14 I
[1:47:24] thought if they told me run around and
[1:47:27] was married 10 times and could prove it
[1:47:29] by papers I just like and you know what
[1:47:34] even if it was identically true you know
[1:47:37] what I'd say thank you Lord for using a
[1:47:40] man to give me the message that I've got
[1:47:42] I've got salvation in my heart from that
[1:47:45] now would you come on some more things

[1:48:44] tried to explain instead of my ways and
[1:48:47] doings but just just take it and believe
[1:48:50] it that even God he said what God tries
[1:48:59] What did he say to Abraham what did you
[1:49:05] say to me Brian now I know you love me
[1:49:10] he's gonna say to a bride one of these
[1:49:13] days what the Bible says enter you into
[1:49:16] the joys of the Lord that was prepared
[1:49:19] for you before the foundation of the
[1:49:21] world why you stood the test you stayed
[1:49:24] with the word you hadn't run off after
[1:49:26] everything else you've stayed with the
[1:49:30] word you see one church you can think
[1:49:35] what you want to I don't care but what
[1:49:39] about a man that will stand and tell you
[1:49:41] the first sermon that he preached in
[1:49:43] 1969 was that the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:49:49] would be the son of man the Word made
[1:49:53] flesh in the life stage somebody asked
[1:50:02] me one time said what does that make you
[1:50:04] to think about you said it I said not a
[1:50:06] sign God I didn't say it somebody else
[1:50:11] did
[1:50:12] that's why I can stand on it today and
[1:50:16] believe what God told me 50 years ago
[1:50:21] can you do that what about it church
[1:50:33] this reader scripture is 1st Corinthians
[1:50:37] 11 I have received of the Lord that
[1:50:39] which also I delivered unto you the Lord
[1:50:42] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:50:43] betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:50:46] given thanks he brake it and said take
[1:50:48] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:50:50] you
[1:50:50] this is doing remembrance of me now for
[1:50:53] the same manner also he took the cup
[1:50:55] when he had supped saying this cup is
[1:50:59] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[1:51:01] as oft as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:51:04] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:51:06] and drink this cup you do shew of the
[1:51:09] Lord's death till he come or for
[1:51:11] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:51:13] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[1:51:17] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:51:18] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:51:21] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:51:22] Cup
[1:51:22] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:51:24] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:51:27] not discerning the Lord's body with this
[1:51:30] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:51:32] and many sleep but we would judge
[1:51:34] ourselves we should not be judged I love
[1:51:37] this but when were judged we're chasing
[1:51:41] to the Lord that we should not be
[1:51:43] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:51:45] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:51:47] tarry one for another and if any man
[1:51:49] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[1:51:51] out together on the condemnation and the
[1:51:54] rest I said in order when I come let's
[1:51:58] just have a few moments of silent prayer
[1:51:59] before we're going into the community
[1:52:22] others just bless each one of us meet
[1:52:24] with us as we partake that we may be all
[1:52:27] together it's one in you Lord that we
[1:52:30] may be what you want us to be and it's
[1:52:35] your word can open into our hearts and
[1:52:37] minds we can see the real meaning of
[1:52:40] where we're at and what we are what's
[1:52:42] going on we can understand how that all
[1:52:46] of these things can be because of the
[1:52:49] way your prophet brought the word we
[1:52:52] love you we thank you forgive our sins
[1:52:55] and bless those traveling you know we're
[1:52:57] coming back home that your love be with
[1:53:00] us in Jesus name the Bible City took
[1:53:07] bread and blessed it father we thank you
[1:53:09] for this bread it's made for this
[1:53:11] purpose we come to the place now to just
[1:53:14] each one partake of a little bit that
[1:53:17] little bit is represented with that word
[1:53:19] and father we thank you for it
[1:53:22] and let your word have the preeminence
[1:53:23] and each one of our hearts and lives
[1:53:25] sanctify the food into partakers in
[1:53:27] Jesus name
[1:53:40] you remember when you first heard and
[1:53:44] thought about and you said well we know
[1:53:47] that that's not blood and in all of this
[1:53:50] and the other thing people are just
[1:53:52] fanatical but you remember when the
[1:53:55] truth began to be made known to you
[1:53:58] about the blood and the things they've
[1:54:03] become a wonderful reality into our
[1:54:05] hearts and our lives that we wouldn't be
[1:54:09] deceived and fathers just bless us and
[1:54:13] keep us because all anybody could pray
[1:54:16] into his word that we may walk in his
[1:54:20] light be led by the Lord into the word
[1:54:24] that all of us could be together as one
[1:54:27] in him we thank you for the truth that
[1:54:31] you've given unto us thy word that has
[1:54:34] been shed into our hearts and lives

[1:54:51] in our body helping us to live we know
[1:54:54] what it is the spiritual meaning of that

[1:54:59] it alive into our hearts and not we love

[1:55:03] in Jesus name
