========================================

let's turn to First Kings chapter 17. all that is it going for you mama where is that little fan oh right over there it's all right you know what no no we're fine we can do away with it right now okay all right all right all right all right I'm going to continue on from last Sunday I'll just carry on the same tops off so um we're talking about the number 17 I'm just kind of running through some of the things that people are saying around the message about brother Brown and and showing in the Bible where um you know the things that he said were true so I just kind of wanted to keep going on that thought I split the switch that's why testing it takes a second there you go all right you're on now okay so First Kings chapter 17. I remember what we were talking about now that um all through this this book First Kings uh you know it goes through the story of seven Kings the story of Solomon and David and all these different stories and then boom all of a sudden Elijah comes on the scene Elijah chapter seven and First Kings chapter 17 and the first thing he does one of the larger the test bite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel living the born in my stand this shall not be dude or rain these years but according to my word uh it seems like that this is one of the biggest complaints about brother Brown is why was he so harsh why did he say um why did he say harsh things about about the sisters the women and um why did he say uh that you know your your dog may comparing people to uh Jezebel now now remember the story of Jezebel when Yahoo came riding in on his Chariot Jezebel looked at him out of the window and started fixing her her face up to look real pretty and Yahoo being a you know servant of God he was inspired by the Lord he looked at that and said I ain't falling for that and if even without the Holy Ghost he looked upon that and and it's like that that's not right and my if uh you know if we could kind of keep to the same standards that they did even back then without the Holy Ghost and uh he he looked upon that with with wisdom and and they that you remember the the uh the concubines or whatever that were wither through throughout the window and the dogs ate her up now brother Brown was comparing these worldly women with that because if you if you look down two tracks you've got everybody has a choice to make you you can go the the way of God or take the way of your own thoughts your own make your own denomination and go a separate way let you continue down that track then it goes to away what brother Brown said you're nothing but a cannon fodder because you're just waiting for the fire to fall and consume you up and there there won't be uh any um you won't have any part with eternal life because uh you chose the way of your own ideas and things and um so that what brother Brandon when he when he was preaching truth but many people just have a problem with truth and uh you know brother random talked about how there's a big difference between love and sympathy if you sympathize right with Jezebel that's a whole lot different than you know today this is the age of sympathy where people are you know you know at my work you know if you don't sympathize with the homosexuals and different things and you're not you're out but um real love will will bring it right on down the line right so let's um so what he says there shall not be do nor Reign these years but according to my word now everybody looks at brother random says he said so let's turn over to First Kings chapter 18. whose word was it and it came to pass after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year saying go show thyself unto Ahab and I will send rain upon the Earth my brother Brandon will just we read that quote and looking to the Unseen where God actually because he was able to yield himself completely to God then God was able to use his lips to speak through him and I was reading in the um uh the little the little book that sister Rebecca had put out with the testimonies about that is the one of the sisters was talking about how she had asked brother random does your voice change when God begins to use you when he's speaking through his lips and he said yeah you'll notice it does change a little bit but you know to be honest I I really a lot of times can't tell you you can't uh he you know once you listen to The Seven Seals he said those were the most inspired sermons that I ever preached but it sounds a lot like you know just brothers speaking but it was God behind things working and it wasn't just a man but we know that it wasn't just a man's message because everything was so perfectly put together amen now that's many people say well he he plagiarized things off of Clarence Larkin and all these others but because it fits so perfectly together we know that it was a Vindicated message now how you think well if I could just explain it just the right way for my kids then they would see it if I could just explain it it's just the most perfect way then they would see it let's see how Elisha saw it let's turn over to First Kings chapter 19. and look at it now I think this is another example how it shows that it wasn't a man because after Elijah had the spirit of the Lord was on him and he slew all of the the prophets of Baal then they um you know Jezebel turned against him and she was gonna she uh he ran Afraid from her because the spirit of the Lord left him and that proves that he ran to that cave and that proves that it wasn't if it was him he would have carried on you know but it was the spirit of the Lord was what was behind working the whole thing out and um so Elijah ran to his cave now our Elijah also had a little cave he ran too when when thing you know he talked about um when that that Showdown came you know we were looking at that how he had he said he had 17 left and he ran off to his cave to have a showdown on God and he ran off to that cave the time that um that uh he you know the Bible right Moses wrote all the little problems and things that's another thing that's just so amazing about the Bible Moses didn't write just the good things he wrote all the little bad things too and Elijah brother our Elijah told what kind of ministry we'll get up behind the pulpit and tell all the bad things in his life all the mistakes that's a hard thing to do to get up in front of people and say well I told a lie or I did did this so brother was telling a story about how uh somebody called him on the phone and he said the IRS agent he told his wife tell him I'm not here and uh you know just amazing that he would tell that story but but after that after he felt so convicted he ran off to that cave where God met him he said he stood out on that rock in front of that cave and just raised his hands to the Lord after God had forgiven him and he met him and had fellowship with him and just praising the Lord but let's look at what um Elijah uh let's see let's start um verse 11 let's start at verse 12 of chapter 19. and after the earthquake of fire all the different things came to before Elijah but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire still small voice and it was Sue and Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the inner end of the cave and behold there came a voice in them and said what do us down here Elijah now this is the this is the you look at all the different traits of Elijah uh you know he was a Wilderness man he he went the hard line with a hard line against women and different things but now what could you say was the main trait about Elijah and I think this trait applies to the people that follow Eliza too and God was asking him what are you doing here I think maybe we could ask the same question to us what are you doing here what what is your purpose are you just like sitting in church just filling a seat what are you doing here and he said this is so good I I've been very jealous for the Lord God of hooks and their brother uh last night was talking about being jealous jealous for God and and wanting to have a closer relationship with God now this is this is this I believe this is the attribute of the Elijah Ministry I have been jealous for the Lord God of hosts because the children of Israel have forsaken I couldn't not thrown down that altars and slain our prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away now now pay attention because this is I believe this is how that if you you can't lay it down for your kids so that they can see it it's just perfect you can't uh do that but if because of Elijah's jealousy for the Lord because of the life he lived when Elisha saw that he said there's something there's something here that I want and the Lord said unto him go return on our way to the Wilderness of Damascus and when thou cometh anoint how does they ought to be king over Syria and yay who the son of them she shall thou anoint to be king over Israel and Elijah the son of shift thou anoint to be profit in thy room and it shall come to pass and him that has scared the sword and so on and he tells them about the seven thousand that are that are left that have about the knee so verse 19 will come down to Elijah so he departed fence and found Elijah the son of shafat who was plowing with 12 yoke of oxen before him and he was the 12th and Elisha passed by him and he told him all about all the different doctrines that he believed in he laid it all down and sat down on the table and pulled his put everything out and explained everything real careful no he cast his mantle upon him and that Spirit he Elijah God in that Spirit when he when he got in that spirit and saw the kind of that God was with Elijah then something got a hold of him and later on you know you read about Elisha saying I I I there ain't no way I'm going to leave you when he got when they crossed over the river Jordan there's there's no way I I see God I've seen you you know you call fire down from heaven but I've seen all these things now look at the light the Elijah of our day well he's given us these three big Witnesses the picture of the cooler fire the picture of the the train that fills the temple that picture you can actually see the angel of the Lord is cloudy picture and then the picture of the cloud coming down the Southern Man coming down to reveal the Seven Seals to us when he left the auction and ran after Elijah and said let me I pray he'd kiss my father and my mother and then I will follow thee and he said unto him go back again for what have I done to the now that's a curious little saying I believe what he's saying there is I'm not calling you I'm not the one that's calling you you think that uh you think that God has put you in this position or you think that I have I'm I'm the one that's calling you to serve God but it's god in me he's calling me go ahead on back and he returned back from him and took the Yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of The Oxen and gave unto the people and they did eat then he arose and went after Elijah and ministered unto him now that's that's what I believe that as we go through these things is not to I believe what really catches people for teaching is is a consecrated life I believe that's it let me just talk about for a second about growing up in in my family you know when when we would get sick my dad would uh and not to glorify anybody or anything I'm just telling a story look my dad would he would throw himself over my bed while I was sick all night long he'd pray all night long you know many people are prayer warriors but um I believe we should all have a prayer life because that's what really communion is is is is communing with God and you know one night my dad was in prayer and the dog started barking next door and there was the pillar of fire at the window now when you're a kid you just remember things like that there God is real God is he's there's a real God things like that begin to happen to your family one day my wife she ran out of gas and pulled over on the side of the road excuse me and the gas tank was only empty what are we going to do that began to meditate on the Lord and and all the players in the car washed as the gas tank went back to uh half empty it didn't go all the way back before but it went enough right to where she could drive and I have just so many different stories where people can see your children can see God in your life that's right it's not just you telling them uh well let me explain this to you but it's the power of God in your life right you know in in the Old Testament get off my top a little talk a little bit but in the Old Testament they they put those The 10 Commandments in the Ark of the Covenant and really all around their history they wanted to see those Ten Commandments be brought to life that's right and one day Jesus came on the scene that's what that's what everybody wants to see is and to be brought to life not just explain what the first team what what is the first commandment but let me see it live that there's one God right so now oh just talking about criticism you know criticism is supposed to come when we went through the Beatitudes about how the persecuted are blessed and think about all the people in the through through scripture that like Mary think about the persecution and the criticism she had to endure or everybody thought she was a harlot and I thought it was first woman but she was carrying the word of God inside of her right and then uh the woman at the well who what she heard what she had received that whale that Wellspring of everlasting live I heard about it then she didn't care what anybody thought she went running into the City and and and that day it was totally against their Customs or anything to listen to somebody like that but they they uh something would prick their horse because she had she had met the one that could bring the word to life not just to explain it right now brother Brandon when he we talked about when he went overseas to look at the um to uh in India and I think it was Bombay he came before the 17 different religions and this is what he said uh this might be a little different quote but he he just had the same line of thought he's saying I'm not trying to get you to change your thought because that's what uh you know Baptist people from Baptist to methodists to Presbyterian from one Church to another just changing their thought baptized front was baptized backwards baptized this way do it do all the different ordinances in different ways but it's not about a change of thought it's not about if you can explain it in just a particular way but it's about a life or is it right to life and we went through the number 17 real quick and just looked at all the the 17 is the seventh prime number the prime number is a number that can't be divided it's only available by 1 and 17. and it's it's a special number because whenever you see something being Vindicated many times in scripture like Esther is the 17th book of the Bible because a Vindicated bride is presented and uh it's God proving his word and all these scriptures about the Rapture about the baptism of the Holy Ghost associated with the number 17 about Elijah coming first Thessalonians 4 17 we would Survivor remain should be caught up together within the clouds of Elijah truly first come Ephesians 1 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation Revelation and knowledge is the evidence of the Holy Ghost where God reveals things to you and shows teaches you his word he brings it up to you and and then we went through the message baptizing the 17th person on the Ohio River how here he him was recorded 17 times and his text was Matthew 17 and the 17 different religions and and so forth and then by other fruits he shall know them brother Brown talked about how you're known your fruits are your Doctrine is it because you can explain it well is that what he meant no because you know you know Paul said you're fruits the fruits of the spirit of love joy peace love love bringing forth that Doctrine and making it that doctrine of uh if you love the things of the world the love of God's not even in you you can say that but now bring it to life bring the life of joy and peace let the peace of God that passeth all understanding be inside of you and I I believe that's what he he meant by fruit not just being able to sit down on the table and Bash somebody over the head with how much you know but to bring forth the doctrine that you have and let the Holy Spirit Quicken after you that's why Jesus told Nicodemus except you'd be born of the of water and spirit of the water the washing of the word and spirit the word must be quickened and made alive in you so that you can live it and then you know if it wasn't for brother Brandon we can look at things in this in the scripture and look at this like this cloud and not understand how to look at it but he showed us how to look at it the right way right now now let's start going through some of these questions why wasn't the cloud publicly announced before May and I I actually got a question in my email somebody asked well is there any any other scripture in the Bible where something happened and then it wasn't announced it was Kept Secret all right so let's look at Luke 2 19. this is when the Shepherds came the shepherds in the field and they and the uh the Angels appeared to them and then they went to the little baby Jesus and Mary and Joseph imagine all this they're they're in their little home and they're in the cave or wherever Jesus was born and all of a sudden the Shepherds show up think about how surprising that would be but Mary kept these things she didn't go running around reclaiming it she kept all these things and pondered them in her heart now think about the number 17. think about how brother Randall said not about the Rapture now it's been spoken now let it come to pass because the number 17 signifies Vindication it's been spoken okay that's great but what about me can I bring that to pass can God bring it to pass in my life right now when he brings it to pass that's what number 17 is all about I believe so Mary kept all these things in her heart okay now they're saying that this is the Messiah an angel spoke to me I believe it now let's just sit back and watch and if if this is true I don't believe she was really doubting or anything I'm just saying let's let's wait and watch for the Manifest manifestation of the word of God to be fulfilled and when he became of age the the spirit Came Upon him by the River Jordan and he began to enter into his ministry and there's the Vindication Luke 251 because you remember brother Brandon said God proves his word by bringing in the past look 251 and he went down with him and came to Nazareth and this is when Jesus was teaching in the temple and he went down with him and came to Nazareth and was and was subject under them but his mother kept all these things in her heart remember the story about how they a little Jesus when he was uh I believe it was nine years old twelve thank you and uh so they they forgotten down there and they returned back to to go find him he said don't you know I must be about my father's business dude correction is a Mary and um you know just proving exactly who he was but she didn't go running around to all the neighbors saying I've got a special child right she kept it in her heart but now the the real proof let's turn to Mark chapter 9. chapter nine foreign and there was a cloud that overstanded them and a voice came out of the cloud saying oh well we can just we can get off yeah off the video and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son here hear him and suddenly when they looked round about they saw no man anymore said Jesus only with themselves and as they came down from the mountain he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen till the son of man were risen from the dead and they kept that saying with themselves questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean so they kept that saying let's hold on to that until until everything comes to pass Till It's Made manifest and that's exactly what brother Brown did you say why did he wait till the uh it was published in May 7 on May 17th and uh you know I believe that the focus was not so much on the cloud but on the message that he brought he brought the Seven Seals that was the whole Focus right and then the cloud published in Life Magazine just communicated what are you bringing um and then we looked at some of the different things people are saying you know this is all that clearance block had to say about the first single night I just think that's amazing that you can fit everything and say on on one slack now and people say go around and got it from you know this is the second season the seventh seal that's everything he had to say about the seventh seal and I'm not throwing off at all about brother uh Clarence Larkin uh just I've thrown off on people that say you know it just don't make any sense and so here's another objection I'm just kind of going through these just to just so you know if somebody wants to say something you kind of know what was going on part of William Brown's this is what they say Carl Williams 1933 prophecy was that FDR would pick on the Germans lead the world of war and won it for four terms while Roosevelt was inaugurated four times now this brother Brandon prophesied that Roosevelt will be inaugurated for four times four turns and he's the only president that ever was so they agree with that he did not pick on the Germans and follow the world to war after provocation by the Japanese so they're saying that brother random had a personal agreements with uh Franklin Roosevelt and called him a rat because he called him a rascal in 1960. well you know Jesus called here a fox right that don't mean he had a personal group that's right which indicates that he just did not like him so let's see that so what they're saying is that Roosevelt picked on the Japanese actually and just kind of follow everybody else in the war and this is a highly continuous thing in his for his stories because they many people still today don't believe that Roosevelt orchestrated the the war behind the scenes but that's exactly what he did he was trying he was trying to get Germany to go to war with her and then uh when he couldn't get Germany to go to war he switched over to pick it on Japan and uh so let's uh here's another thing to say clearly Roosevelt did not leave the world in the war and we do not quote pick on them as Reverend Brandon claim so here's the vision that bro Brandon had Journey never Germany never picked on us we picked on them through the whole world into a war to call it World War the Germans built the Maginot Line wish there any veteran who knows where she took their imagined offline and this Mr Roosevelt will cause the world to go into a world home service in time of his administration prison I saw President Roosevelt was going to help lead the world to a World War a war told her that morning they was going to lock me up for it and I said they'll go to war with Germany allowance Bill I said there in that same vision I saw Germany fortified in concrete now that's that's really what he said fortified in concrete and America took a terrible beating there many of you boys know what happened was there and then and then he had a vision in the church age book he talks about he had a vision of Adolf Hitler how he would rise up as a dictator of a Germany and they could draw the world into war so they use that as saying well here he says that Hitler would draw the world into war but you know if you look at historical events it's really it just all ties together so here's a little timeline in 1932 Hitler and Roosevelt were both elected at the same time 1933 Hitler and Roosevelt were both installing the office and around June of 1933 brother Brandon received those seven divisions and in 1934 president Hindenburg of Germany dies and Hitler declares himself to fear and then in 1935 Congress passes the Neutrality Act and says we're not going to mess with anybody everybody that's the public stance we're not going to mess with anybody but behind the scenes uh uh Roosevelt began to to move things to try to get Germany to attack uh in 1938 this is after 1938 but they they released um documents later they showed that behind the scenes Roosevelt was demanding that European countries reject Germany's diplomatic offers and he was promising this Portland militarily if they did so and in 1940 we traded some American destroyers to the British and sent millions of tons of supplies to Russia in 1941 Lynn lisak made us a secretly made us an unlimited War partner where we would just we would behind the scenes provide all these supplies to the to the Allies sure and then in 1941 we're supposed to still be part of that Neutrality Act but we're supplying American troops to Iceland and then the Atlantic Conference of Roosevelt New Jersey Churchill in 1941. the Roosevelt and Churchill began to move move uh Ally closely together and uh wheel and deal behind the scenes we'll help you and you'll help us that kind of thing uh they're still supposed to be neutral in 1941 American submarines were ordered to shoot Germany German warships on site that sounds like picking on Germany July 1941. we're imposing the oil embargo on Japan because we couldn't get Germany to attack us and then uh that's you know then Pearl all right and emergency store in JFC Fuller said about President Roosevelt he'll have no stone unturned to provoke Hitler to declare war on the very people on whom he so ardently promised peace he provided Great Britain with American destroyers he landed American Producers in Iceland and he set out to patrol the Atlantic seaways in order to safeguard British convoys all of which were actually more and so on then Admiral H.R Clark chief of U.S naval operations and acknowledging the confidential 1941 member for the president he Hitler has every excuse in the world to declare war on us now if he were of a mind to now this is something that really only a prophet could know because to the world he was he was declaring peace he was declaring he just said just all kinds of little things going on behind the scenes that only God will know uh it's just summarizing not the magical line here's another objection brother random sometimes uses the word maginol on it and other times the C free line which was it he states that Germany built the magic online oh they just they just uh it gets me how you can kind of you can bend or it's called sophistry when you just bend words to make up your own argument and completely uh ignore the truth uh now this is back in the early prophecy we'll go to war with Germany and Germany will be fortified behind concrete and we will take an awful beating at this place that's what that's what the prophecy was we go in the Ephesian churches and we go to war with Germany and Germany would be fortified behind concrete and why are we not in the nomination Germany would rise up and put that Mangano line there and a super sign German people by me but he assured the German people about about building what we call imaginal mind of secret Landing for billions of dollars billions of tons of concrete is still together serious confidence in it that he moved his head of orders up to the front line where restaurants and business places operate underneath the ground and I imagine online was just a huge superstructure where they had train cars moving underground underneath it and just they could just stay under there for a long time it was just like a little Resort on there almost where they had billions of stealing cement no matter how it ever went Germany was fortified it was a sign of safety but the modern Blockbuster broke bloated into eternity and Hitler with it condemnation that Americans will take a great meeting in a meeting at a place that Germany will build which would be a great wall bill of concrete the imaginal line 11 years before it was ever built but finally there will be the victors so it's confusion about what the imaginary line is but if you look at it on the map this Germany and France are maybe about the size of Wisconsin and another state yeah you know there's a common comparison with the management online is what after World War One France built to keep Germany out and uh on the other side of the Magnolia line on the on the French side the imaginal line was was there on the others on the German side the Germans built the sieged feed line in that it went by another name until War II but uh the French only ran the magical lineup to about here because of the Big Forest up here so they thought that would keep the tank German tanks and everything else so they stopped the wall there and Germany built this uh they extended their seed free line all up so when you say management online see free line is just like right over there it's just like you know 50 feet or whatever it's the same thing there's no difference so the program says Seafood line imagine online it's the same it's just right across the way so over over the course of the war you know at some point in the war Germany would take over part of the magical line of up in the north and they'd still be fighting the French would be fighting on this against the C3 line down here and then vice versa so some parts of the wall it'd be the Germans would have control over the national line other parts of the wall The Fringe should have control over the seafood line so to to uh nitpick over a terminology it just don't make any sense because it's really it's the same it's this this line uh the demarcation between the two territories yeah so and then brother Brian talked about how we Face a lot of casual this is uh and this is another point of disputation and so these are the three big old huge conflicts uh that's a technical term big old huge the patents Lorraine campaign near Mets lost 55 182 men the Battle of hurricane Forest which was up north 24 000 and the biggest the battle of the Bulls lost 89 500 and I almost lost the whole first and Ninth us armies so to say that we didn't have casualties that the management line is just not really understand history the municipal Bridge now I was just going to talk about this real quick because this they say well we don't have any evidence of anybody falling off the bridge and this is Brother Brown's his vision was I counted 16 minutes fell off that breeding ground and I went and told them I told her I seen it and so it worked for me for that so if they say we can't find any historical documents we're having us to pull them to stay on the 16 men died during the construction and it's additionally it's clear that William Brown state that 16 men died by Drowning so they're looking at at Hard Evidence over from over a hundred years ago some newspaper or something that has evidence so this is what they put on their website the video below they made a little video of what uh say in their Viewpoint the video below contains an error and that it indicates there were no fatalities in the building of the municipal Bridge because first they said there are no there are no fatalities then they had to withdraw it oops never mind we actually did find two fatalities and then they kept going on up so uh it's just a it's just a broad statement to say there's no uh you know I was listening to Peregrine's testimony about how he said that the mayor of Jeffersonville knew that brother Brown was a prophet because he knew that when that when brother Brown was a little boy he told about that bridge being built now irregardless of how many people fell off that bridge he knew that Bill Brown was a prophet because that breed was built brother random knew it would be built before like 11 years before they ever built it did Brother Brown say he would be alive to see The Return of Jesus Christ now this is another way they twist the the doctrine because in first Thessalonians it teaches you know this is this is what they're twisting that we which are alive and remain in the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the truth of God in which are alive and remain Shall be Called together within the clouds so of course will be alive to see him physically return did anyone die after brother Brandon prayed for them well um oh my you know many people build them right exactly and then they're associated with Jim Jones with the message how was Jim Jones associated with missionary you know he went he's the one that uh they're saying Jim Jones started looking famous when he held a series of services with the help of William Brown like the Cato Tabernacle in Indianapolis Indiana so it's soft Street yeah they're making it sound like brother Graham went out of his way to pull this brother in and set up a meeting and all this kind of stuff well what really happened was um uh uh Jones organized I'm I'm just reading I'll figure it he organized the mammoth religious convention in June 11th through June 15 1956 in an Indianapolis Hall called Cato Tabernacle this was way before he began to go into all his on beliefs to draw the crowds DM needed a religious headliner and so he arranged to share the with brother Randall a healing evangelist and religious offers highly agreed by something going Robert this is actually taking off from Wikipedia so the critique is well why he was a prophet why didn't he know that this man would go off into into into Cults and different things now so if he was a prophet so what are some examples of prophets in the Bible that didn't didn't that some things were hidden from them what about Jesus that uh Jesus was right in his midst and and he knew he actually knew but he he uh allowed things to continue and what about Jacob they said he was a prophet he said where is Southern Joseph he didn't he wasn't aware that his son Joseph was down in Egypt all that time and just you can keep going on and on about how God you know Billy Paul came to brother Randleman and told him I'm going to get married tomorrow and he said get next to yourself son because God had hidden that from me and then he went and got married but um well gone ahead from Elijah when a little woman baby died right that's the baby died he said to God told me anything he hidden those things from me so yeah yeah I believe God knows what you need to know and that's that thing around you every thought he'd go you'd go crazy about that a lot about Revelation about the things that we know now if I if we had known 15 years ago or so we just it'd just blow them up right you go you'd be crazy you've been up yeah exactly and uh this last one we'll just end on this program so the Democracy it won't last more than 200 years at Alexander Tyler in 1700s or so wrote a democracy is always temporary it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of illness but democracy will continue to exist until the voters gifts from the public Traders from that moment the majority will always vote for the candidates who promised the most benefits from public treasure would result that every democracy will finally collapse and the example that he used was the Athenian government Athens and Greece they were a democracy where the people actually voted directly from the for the ruling of the government and what happened was 200 years after Athens became a democracy they started killing people Socrates and Plato and all those famous people were killed because they their ideas opposed the ideas of people and that's when the Democracy failed and uh so we'll just stop right there awesome you gotta also remember too before 1976 would have been the 200th year right right you know what Gerald Ford was not an elected president remember yeah what's his name they were going to impeach him and he resigned information then he was not loaded in he just became president he wasn't a voted president so to me then the democracy is over that's good that was before 1976.
