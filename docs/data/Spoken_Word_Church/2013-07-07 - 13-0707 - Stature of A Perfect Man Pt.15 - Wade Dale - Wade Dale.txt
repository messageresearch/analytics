========================================

y'all had a wonderful teacher last sunday yes y'all were rough on him though man started on the first peter yeah he'll be there next time um next pete with first peter man he goes to read and y'all going no no stop you hear it on the thing no that's not it no where you at where are you somebody said where are you but it is people with like precious faith and we we uh we see that too but like brother brown says here we're going to start this sausage you must be warned again i want to make sure that we understand that that has changed there's got to be a change you say brother brown i know this certain woman over here why she never did do anything wrong she's a good woman or this sucking such a man he's a good man he never does anything you know he doesn't harm anybody that doesn't mean one thing he might make a good neighbor but he isn't a christian until he's born again jesus said abandon except a man be born again say john 3 that he can't even see the kingdom now that means c means to understand you look at anything say i just don't see it you mean you don't understand it all right all right then he goes on mankind that natural eye can't see how the glory of god will come over a man's eyes and he'd see visions and tell men of certain things and what to do tell them things is fixing to happen and fix things that come past like the lord did for us here last night how about a miracle all right man speaking in tongues they can't understand that though until the man is born again then when he's born again then he's in line of fellowship that's when you become in line of fellowship that's when you become in the line of the new burden like dad was talking about last sunday that's where your life precious faith comes in you can't have like precious faith with a sinner and a saint you can converse and be friends and all that but when it comes down to the word of god two can't walk together unless they be agreed all right then when he's born again then he's in line of fellowship because he's a new creation that old suspicious doubting character he was is dead dead remember but they're preaching on the dead god let it die now he's a new creation so you see he don't have to add anything to his now because it automatically be added notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right see on my chart here i got the very foundation faith is the foundation of all of it without faith it's impossible to please god neither cometh a god must believe that he is and a reward of those that diligently seek him see he must be and when you're a skeptic of the bible when you're skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe it what is sin unbelievable two elements that control the human being now it's not see taste phil's melon here memory reason conscious effects and imagination that works because of what's on the inside all right you're possessed either that's either faith that's either doubt or faith one or the other you're possessed of one that dominates your life now you see that that dominates your life now because we have trials and struggles with the faith virtue and knowledge implications of godly brother kindness we have troubles with that that's the spirit part of man and really it doesn't have anything to do with the flesh because the flesh only does what the spirit tells it to do all right so you're possessed of one that dominates your life in other words it uh when i was a sinner and you were a sinner that dominated your life god had no part in it he was just not he was uh not there nor he wasn't it was you and the devil because you were married to him right but when you come into being born again you're possessed the one that dominates your life just depends on how much faith you have how high you can rise okay but first it's got to be faith let me stay on that foundation for a while now faith is what you must believe faith is what substance things hope for it you already have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith faith is the subject of things hope for hebrews 11 the evidence what is it what kind of evidence may i may i not say something that brother brown did not say but a spiritual evidence brother brown said a holy evidence which is a spiritual evidence you've got to have a spiritual evidence there is a natural evidence and then there's a spiritual evidence all right the natural evidence is is what is outward there's a spiritual evidence which comes from inside works its way out and there's a spiritual evidence that you may do something wrong you may hurt a brother you may say something against somebody human nature you may you may do something but what that spiritual evidence will always say hey i'm sorry or repent or or you know things like that because remember anything that's not of faith is doubt and anything it's not a faith to sin okay so we're sinners saved by grace we've got to look at that blood atonement more now than ever before because if we don't look at that blood atonement you just got to look at your natural self and your natural self just not going to make it depend on him to kill it god let it die you can't kill anything but you know what you can do i was telling them at brother doug scott last sunday you can let you can let the lord in but there's still other doors in your house he may be in your living room but if there's a door of pride or this or that or whatever it is if there's a door there that you don't want him in the holy ghost is a timid person he will not force himself into that into that room so the holy ghost is a gentleman he can ask you you can actually grieve the holy ghost that's right grieve not the holy spirit of god thinks in ephesians whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption you're sealed but it doesn't mean the holy ghost leaves you and go down on a limb that's just illustration purposes what it means is god said hey you got a problem you need to fix it and i'm going to just step out here real quiet and i'm going to wait on you because he's a gentleman he's not going to force himself he's a gentleman he's going to say hey i'm going to wait on you because remember brother brown says it's not that the devil comes in right the devil doesn't come in you go out to meet the devil you're the one that goes out you go out to meet the devil the devil can't get in your soul if you're born again you just can't reside there two people can't reside in the same place all right but now he can sure get in that memories and conservation imagination and get so close to that soul right because you can't you can't you separate my soul my spirit i'm a dead man but we can see what dominates that's what he said what dominates your life up in the quote before that it's what you need to look at and that's why that we need to look and keep looking at a holy evidence our spiritual evidence therefore when you say brother branham i believe that god is the healer well if you believe that then accept him as your healer and not lying but actually believe that he by his stripes you're healed there's nothing going to turn you from it it's a settled thing now you might have hope just keep dodging to this and dodging to that but when you've got faith you know it because it is the evidence you've already got it that's what we've got to believe he's talking about oral roberts um with a contact told me to touch my radio now he said oral roberts did good things too bad i got more of him but what he's trying to say is faith doesn't need anything so i said there was never a devil cast out in the in the in the bible by screaming and grabbing and pushing and pulling and throwing them on the ground and we see that happen a lot but power with character when the devil walks up to a christian that's really got the virtues jesus just said leave and paul had that sorcerer following him around all the time and she just kept nanning and and and and and then and then and there and somebody around him said why don't you just rebuke her in other words he said i haven't got that nod yet okay that's why something can bug you for years then all of a sudden god says that's enough all right and what paul did paul turned around and rebuked the spirit not the woman he rebuked the spirit spirit left i don't believe he grabbed her and threw her up against the wall and shook her i believe he just said go i've had enough this is it go leave well you know what that's power with character because the devil knew there was something speaking like brother branham was speaking to that maniac now he said that maniac could have tore me up broke every bone in my body he was almost three times the size of brother brown so he could have just picked him probably up with one hand and throw him out in the congregation or up against the wall but there was power with character was standing there and he didn't say anything he just said leave he said you'll fall at my feet and he said you know in other words he reached back to strike him and he said all of a sudden he hit the quarter all right well that was faith brother had faith in who he was and we got to start having faith in who we are all right not not in that look not have faith in what we're going to be that's right have faith in who we are if you have faith in who you are it will carry to what you carry you to what you want to be everybody understand that because you can't say well i'll have faith next week right or i'll have faith when i get patience i'll have faith no you gotta have faith you gotta believe that i am a christian and i am born again problems problems problems peter had a problem with his temper when he got born again i'd say he didn't have that kind of problem with his temper but he come to a place where he had to have temperance right right because peter's what it says add to your faith virtue knowledge temper because he knew he had a temper so we know the things that we need to work on there's no way that i know what you need to work on there's no way you know what i need to work on except that we can put it in the reflection or the mirror of the word of god because here the roman went out to meet jesus so i'm not worthy you even come into my roof i'm not worthy my son's very sick you just speak the word and my son will live what is it distance made no difference because god is on the present omnipotent and everywhere god is omnipotence is there and god being on the president that makes god everywhere all over see he's in africa and all those places but he says i'm not worthy that you come into my roof just speak the word what was it it was that roman's faith now look that roman didn't have substance faith he didn't have holy ghost faith because he didn't possess it he just had faith in what that person said that's why that a prostitute could come before brother branham she knew she was dirty she knew she but she's in other words in her heart she said i believe what that man says you know she got her healing why she didn't have things like we as christians would walk up in front of brother around him and go oh i spoke bad to my my wife this morning and i spoke bad to my boss today before and you know those things just the devil just start bombarding you with all that stuff and what brother brad said you'll miss your healing because of what because you're thinking about all the things that you did do and didn't do okay jesus just said go your way your son lives it was a two-day journey and in other words he was healed the same hour that's the kind of faith we got to have i'm nip that i'm president i'm this infinite that's god so when they make a phone call say pray that contacts he prayers the contact yes not the hand the bible does say lay hands on the scene and shall recover didn't say pray all right said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover your faith brings god it's the thing that brings the prayer and god together on the scene now now here's a point that i want to look at faith changes from here to here it brings it together but realize one thing god knows the outcome of the prayer yes so we're not praying to to make god realize that he's the healer you understand what i'm saying he's he wants us to realize and in our journey as we walk he wants us to see not the change that's in him but the changes in us okay because if you've got the holy ghost you've got everything you need why does it not work 100 because of us that's right right because the holy ghost is faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brother kindness and love because that love if you're born again today and you die today they put you we put you in a grave in a couple of days you will resurrect with that perfect love actually you'll go into that dimension that's right where perfect love is brother brown said all that you know the angel said he said well how do these people all get here he said they all had perfect love what they had the new birth for their portion or for their time or for their ability all right that we were talking about last night martin luther had the ability to bring a group of people to have faith in the just shall live by faith you understand what i'm saying because what happened was they were believing in a catholic church a catholic dogma they were believing in the pope they were believing in a priest but martin luther was trying to say hey you don't need to do that we don't need an intercessor between you and god right he said you don't need an intercessor that's what he was saying he said you don't need that because the just shall live by the catholic church that's what they were trying to say the just shall live by the catholic church or you can do penance and we'll give you this this and this you know we'll give you some of these verses if you've got enough money you're right what the catholic church would say you got enough money we'll just hand you these virtues the priest has them hey the dude's got the ability to turn that wafer into the into the body of god i mean come on now but we know he didn't we know that was false but people had faith in that and they got healed because of that that's right during the age of columbus that was real hard time to be to be alive of course that was a martyr time but to be a christian you were different all right well see martin luther come to a place to where he brought a group out and said the just shall live by the faith of god not the faith you have in a priest that's why they excommunicated it that's why then he wrote the 95 thesis that's why then he come out and said the just shall live by faith not by penance because you know what he did penalties you ever watch the movie he'd crawl on the ground he would he would lay prostate on the ground on rocks with his face in the rocks what trying to get those evil thoughts out of his mind he thought he could do enough penance to get his mind pure that's what i believe martin luther was trying to do if you watch him you saw him in that room in the movie a really good portrayal of of martin luther but he was man just like demons were were you know in and out of his brain trying to tell him to do things and he was trying to get rid of that and i believe though that god came and told him i believe an angel i believe all the church age messengers had angels right brother branham had one paul had one i believe they all had an angel or had a visitation from god let's say that so they had a bit of visitation from god from god and that that angel just like with brother branham he took him to scripture and i believe that the angel took martin luther because remember the just shall live by faith is not just in the new testament i think it's in the it's in zechariah or somewhere it says the just shall live by faith then hamacha they just shall live by faith well he'd have to go to the new testament they were just writing the new testament at that time during martin luther's time he looked back in the old testament and i believe the angel said here this is what's promised to you see my point i'm making is is you and i must see that the promise made us that's the promise made to us right that mountain caleb that's the mountain that you're desiring to possess but you're not just going to walk up there and have cake and ice cream with the enemy he'll kill you it's it's hard for me to understand how god can i know god honors faith but it's hard to understand how he honors the faith that people have in the catholic church another religion well faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen it didn't say you had to believe the message okay right he just said faith is the substance of things hoped for that prostitute walked up there and just believed so much she didn't believe that so much that god was in her she believed god was so much in that man standing in front of him that that faith had a contact just for a second now it didn't save her soul just faith for the time then save her soul but you're right she had faith for her time she had split second faith to get healed because healing atonement is not based on christianity by his stripes all christians are healed that's not what the bible says by his stripes you are healed or we're healed i'm just going to say to trudy when i think about that i think of it as like a law like a law of god like or like the law of gravity i mean it's just it's just a thing that you enter into that you enter into that and you have it but it's not it's not this faith that we were talking about here it's not a holy evidence because that wasn't a holy person that was walking up before brother brown but they uh god so honored her just saying i just believe to god i just believe the guy can touch god and if he said there's an angel between me and him guess what there's an angel between me and him and that angel has come to heal me it's configuring updates it's updating the computer whatever let it uh don't turn it off yeah i know it's got to configure the updates computer age man all right but what happened is that you enter into a law but now that's not that faith right there everybody understand that's not that faith that's substance that's faith that carries you every day of your life the faith that woman had in brother branham was i'm here in front of a man of god i believe what he said if he said there's an angel standing there do you know what i just believe it and god honored that healed her but now the next day she went and done her business if you understand what i'm talking about she didn't have substance faith she had faith for the time just like a lot of people do maybe that thing will pop back up they'll have faith for the time and then you see them they'll they'll get a case of justification or a case of sanctification and they'll feel good and then all of a sudden you don't see them tomorrow no that's okay i will finish next sunday just left the thing let it let it do its updates it's been walking too for a month let it update but uh i don't ever plug this one in so i don't except for here and uh it probably just needs to do a date on something on there but don't worry about it but that faith at the bottom of that pyramid that faith is the faith of god that's not having faith that is the faith of god first we have to have faith in that but that is the faith of god not something you're looking toward it's something that's right here right that's what i said if you have faith now yeah you can it will take you but if you don't have faith now if you didn't say well i'm going to have faith when i get i'm going to have faith when i i'm going to have you're pointing forward you've got to bring that faith here you know what the substance faith is the substance you know what that substance is you faith is the substance of things hoped for you the evidence you of things not saying because you know what jesus christ died one day you've got the new birth and look when you got the new birth what happened eternal god came into this body moved satan out and you know what that was the most the greatest act since creation right but did you see it right did you see it did you physically see faith is the substance of things how far the evidence of things not seen i mean we experienced it it said it was an it was something we experienced right right but it's without observation exactly you can't there's no way you could you you didn't i don't i don't think you did anybody see this burning fire come down and and where did it go in your mouth top of your head in your ears and i'm trying i'm making a silly point but i'm trying to make a point how do you know you're born again you had to have faith that god let it die that's right god did it and then what you're going to do is though is you're going to produce the evidence the evidence of things not seen you're the evidence that's true you're the evidence whether you believe the word whether you come i don't say even come to church but whether the word of god is in you because it's the word of god then you will come to church so that's what scripture says all right but listen that evidence has got to show that's right on the day of pentecost they were scared before that was the evidence it showed right but when the holy ghost came and licks of fire and burn out the old man right god killed 120 old husbands that day right plus they had so much faith that 120 had so much faith till all those virtues were burned into them at the same time why because they had heard the word that's why you can walk you could walk years without with not having any birth but be sanctified and be packing the word in and the same thing was talking about the other day about the seals you can hear the seals put that in your memory one day it will update windows install new updates guess what god is not updated but you're the one that needs to be updated so we need windows install new updates in this computer you know what god's doing the same thing with you you've got them you've earned hey we got memory we got all the things in this computer that we need i thought but some of those programs some of those programs need to be updated so god says hey i updated 120 in the upper room i downloaded would you say now download it he downloaded that that happened for a purpose you know god downloaded into 120 of those virtues right that's right that's what jesus said they were plugged into god you got to be plugged into god first all right then he brings the downloads then you know what they get updates we get updates every sunday and wednesday we get updated from the from the from the from the master hard drive because he's driving hard to get it in us so got his windows that happened for a reason that did happen for a reason but that's right i mean that's true you have the holy ghost these things had programs in it and they were all working but something decided that it needed an update something on the internet decided it needed an update now did you see it come in here and update the thing this is wireless this is just plugged in to give you a signal but what i'm getting from the internet is wireless it's running through this room but something in this computer you said i need an update because i don't have everything i need to make the program work right and i just goes to show you that this relates to every every aspect of the world well see this right here is the master hard drive right this is your master hard drive right here the bible that's your master heart that's where everything is and you know what you can limit it because you limit your hard drive right now you get it cluttered with junk right you can get you can you can clutter it with junk you have to be defragged every once in a while bob you have to help me on this one i'm done no but look if you can't see because we're all hey we're all defragged defrag defragmentation means that that something happens and you stop the program or something quit working and what happens in the hard drive there's a space but there's memory can go in that space what defragmentation does that's pretty good what defragmentation does it takes that gap and it pulls it back together and you can use that space again so what you do on a defragmentation screen you see little everybody ever played tetris you want to have to see it's just little blocks here and there and all over the place what happens is the computer brings all those spaces together and connects them so that you can use a big block of memory down here at the bottom is that good is that right right so so we need to be defracted once in a while we get derailed so we get derailed and we stop god we do it we stop god we stop the program of god all the time do we yeah we do we stop the program of god and you know what happens he says hey there's a gap in there going to defrag you i'm on defragmentation so you got a good you got a good uh lesson on defragging your computer you can actually put defrag you can defrag any computer and it makes it run better it does doesn't it but it makes you run better because what happens is that hard drive starts reading it it finds the gap and it kind of stops but you put the chain back together 66 of them you put the chain back together and you know what that meant that that memory that message can flow right through and you get a lot better contact with god so yeah pretty good that was not in the notes for the day so whatever happened to that that's what happened
