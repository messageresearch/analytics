TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh one is that i was i was listening some brother that was here two years ago i don't know him i never met him but i was looking up on the website and um i was listening to one of his sermons and he was saying um he said you know we can look at each other but and we can say wow you know that that's a great christian but you know you never know what somebody had to go through to get there so um i just want to always remember we don't know each other's journey but we probably all been through a lot to get to where you at right now um the second thing is one of my customers gave me a pair of slippers some really nice slippers and they wasn't my size i tried to stuff my foot in there but they you know it didn't work for me so i held on to him and i had him in my um in my trunk so i came to church sunday and i forgot about him but after i came back outside i was like well i wonder who i can give him to i was trying to think like who was small enough who can fit into him so i figured i'd play cinderella or something you know so um anyway so i just said well maybe i'll maybe i'll do it next time i come back i'll just leave them out and put a free sun on or something so uh the other night i ended up going to the store to grab something right quick and i only brought like a couple dollars with me um so when i got in there i seen a young lady that lives in my neighborhood that she usually walks around i see her every now and then i don't know her but i see her every now and then and i've spoke to her before so anyway this particular night she ended up coming in there and i was in my car trying to find some change because i didn't i needed 50 more cents to get something i was trying to get so i went back inside and i didn't have enough and uh she saw me talking to the cash bridge registered ladies so she was like well how much more do you need i said well 50 50 cents so she gave it to me i was like thank you so much that's so sweet so um she was like well can you give me a ride back home it was at night she's like well can you give me a ride back home i was like okay so she um she was still in the store and i went back out to my um vehicle and just waited on her so uh she she had sandals on so when she came back out she was like you know my feet are so cold you know i wasn't even thinking about the slippers it's like my feet are so cold you know so i took her where she wanted to go and we had to kind of like sit in the car to wait on the person she was waiting on for a minute so um my mom thought about the slippers but i was like well she don't like she can fit him but let me see i said well i might get some slippers you can wear or you might can fit and they were the one like you slip your foot in and it like covers it it was cushioned it was real nice so um i got it back out and she was like let me try them on so she kicked off her sandals they fit her just like cinderella i was like wow that's that was god you know what i'm saying god be knowing little things like that and he'll he'll have him already set up for somebody you know and she was so happy we got a chance to talk and just kind of um get to know her a little better and um she even was like wow god got these for me you know that tonight worked out like that for that reason you know so little things like that i just say keep reaching out to people because sometimes even myself help me lord you know you can get a little spiritual and you feel like well i don't know about you but you know you never know who is who you know and even me i remember when i was out there

into your hands may i just be a voice father of what you want to tell to each and everyone ask it in jesus name amen while we are standing let's open the word of the lord in matthew chapter 21 and it's a very familiar scripture from the message what is the attraction on the mountain matthew 21 verse 1 and it says and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to beth page unto the mount of olives then sent jesus to disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straight away you shall find an ass a donkey let me say call it a donkey tight and they cold with her lose them and bring them unto me and if any man say unto you you shall say the lord has need of them and straight away he will send them all this was done that he might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell you the daughter of sign behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon a donkey and they called the foal of an donkey and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the donkey and the cold and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees straw them in the way in the multiple multitudes that went before and followed christ saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and he was come into jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word and we may be seated i i put up the jacket brother i think that is not a problem for you now i greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ and those who don't know me i'm your brother marcus from germany and uh it's a great honor a real a real joy for me to be here a real joy for me to be here i asked uh i mean even if even if i wouldn't preach for this evening but if i'm here i was landing right maybe two hours ago or maximum three hours in atlanta and i said if i'm in the area i would come by and just shake your hands i'm already blessed uh paul said when i saw the brothers from rome i was already strengthened and fortified just by seeing them and and it's a great honor for me and i love very much brother dale our most noble elders and pastor but the day may god keep you and hold you our precious brother and we heard how god is recovering you and brother wade and thanks for your friendship and may god richly the best all of you and i would sleep the night in brother louise and when i was here first time years ago dad brother lewis was newly coming to the church and and i saw how he's growing he's growing uh in his stature of a man he he's not a teenager anymore he's a real man uh no he is he is you know and he is uh he's growing spiritually you know you talk with him he seems to be under very good care you know in intensive care somehow you know because he's growing so fast and uh but uh so my compliments to the to the pastor and to the ministers here because he seemed to have a very good development it's a pleasure to see you know and so it's a compliment back to you so may god richly continue to bless you and uh yes i'm on my way for for different meetings and services we have a little project but i will not enter into this and uh if it's fine for you i know it's a wednesday i'm directly entering into the word of the lord is that fine not to i'm normally not a long preacher this evening neither i come directly to my point and i don't know if i was even preaching that uh uh once i was preaching twice here but doesn't matter i had three subjects really all the flights go into the notes and to different things and and sweet subject and now it was up prominent for me to preach about that subject if it's the little refreshment that i was preaching the same thing that it's fine uh accounted just to my age once you are past 50 you're becoming more uh wise but older that's fine and uh yeah and i i have a right one thing to say please don't take what i say but what i want to say okay i uh brother louise know i'm speaking a little bit of spanish and uh but i'm not i'm not preaching in spanish because i told the brother said if i will preach in spanish you will have a split in the church just because of my grammar so so even my english but if you so if you want to understand me you can get it and uh i would like to bring us into that picture okay i would i would i i would i would like to talk about us okay not about only you but about us because this message changed the bible the pages are the same but brother abraham said the bible became a new book and and i think i i have a right to say this uh uh no matter for where i come from but the message that we believe does not come from america it comes from the presence of almighty this is what the angel told brother branham i'm sent from the presence of almighty this message does not come from from from indiana it comes from god amen and it's for god's children and this message gave us our identity nobody could explain who we were but only the one who created us could explain us and and and there were many mysteries that were revealed over over many thousand years but this is the time when god says the mystery of god not mysteries scofield saw already some mysteries but this is the mystery which is revealed and nobody could reveal it but only the messenger for this age and brother bryan preaches christ is the mystery of god revealed maybe there is different interpretations and we know uh scriptures have compound meaning but for me it's it's it's to say that god has a family god has a power god god has not only let me say disciples but god has a bride and this bride is part of christ this part is this this bride is is part of him as eve was part of adam the brightest is part of christ so we talk not only about people who are just believing the message uh getting saved but we are talking to people who got saved they got the baptism of the holy ghost but now they are entering into adoption now into a position because this is a rapturing time and and the rapture in time needs rapturing faith and rapturing faith comes by the word for this age therefore these seals have to be opened and brother branham says god took the seals from christ and then he says he he took the seals from us this showed who we were in the mind of god amen amen blessed be the name of the lord and so we see that that that that that jesus was coming down that that mountain the mount of olives now brother branham preaches it in the message uh what is the attraction on the mountain and he sees he says here he stands and he's sitting upon a white donkey the bible doesn't say that it was a white donkey but brother brandon was a prophet he could see things you could see what happened in the what happened in the garden of eden you could see what happened and then he could show it in the scriptures with a prophet and and and and what happened is that he said what happened on that mountain he said prophecy was fulfilled and history was made and god has many ways to lead his children i think the last time when i was here was i was preaching about the father how god is a father god is not a dictator god is a father he wants to be a father he wants to be a friend god doesn't want muslim worship you see we can come to church and we can say oh god is great and he is great i mean god knows that he is great because he says there's nobody besides me he knows who he is but when your children come from when you come from work you don't want your children fall on your knees and say oh papa he comes home he brings money so we can go to mcdonald's and but no no no you want your children to hug him [Applause] and god wants his children to hug him said lord we love you because this message brother branham was the voice but there was a voice behind the voice it was our father talking to us we find out that when a person dies that the last of his senses uh that he is losing is his ear is hearing that's what science says or medical sciences and they found out if a young person or a person for example is a fan of michael jackson and that person falls into a coma not that but falls into a coma and you put michael jackson's music on his ears and he was a fan he comes back because he remembers that voice so i told the church if one time i fall into coma you know what you put on my ears okay and if i just listen good evening friends i'm back here [Applause] amen amen so so so so we came on this earth and nobody asked us where do we want to live when do we want to come nobody else or do you want to be black or white nobody asks you do you want to live in america or in germany do you want to be male or female nobody ask you and sometimes we think that our life is was a failure from the beginning and it was a failure until our father called us that changed our life we hurt our father well for us we don't follow branhamism we are christians we are not brahmites we are not in a cult we are christians but we understand who this messenger was because the father is the head of his home a pastor is the head of a local church the messenger is the head of a church age and christ is the head of all seven messengers i was one time asked the question brother marcus can somebody correct the prophet i said sure god can because christ is the head of all seven messengers we have two messengers that were special the first one had a right to write the bible that was paul and the seventh one was the one who was interpreting the unwritten things or the unknown things bringing us rapturing faith but christ is the head of all things therefore we we we are so privileged and we understand how god has different ways to lead one time it was it was time that the the savior had to be born and an angel comes to mary and says behold or she says behold the maid handmaid of the lord she believed the visitation of that angel and we have to understand that we are that mary carrying that christ amen and then she has a husband by the name of joseph and joseph well uh he wanted to believe that story and brother even says that joseph was an older man and he wanted to believe her but he couldn't believe but you have to understand god had to do that something for joseph because joseph was the protection for mary when joseph would have left mary mary would have been stoned so joseph was a gentleman he said we will not make a problem here in the church i will just go so god had to come but god didn't send an angel god came in a dream amen god has many ways to lead his children this is what the pentecostals never understood god has sensational ways and natural ways to lead his children and so when joseph was waking up from his dream he was a different man he could stand you can only stand in your life if you have revelation therefore doctrine is not enough teaching them is not enough it must be revelation from your father so at the same time there were some some some mary and joseph they were living in bethlehem but uh in nazareth but the birth of jesus must have been in bethlehem to fulfill the scripture so we need somebody to bring them from nazareth to bethlehem so god uses just a a great king by the name of of uh was it agrippa or or um the roman the roman cather was augustus argus augustus so so he inspired augustus to make a law that everybody has to come back into their native city and even the generals they said i mean what kind of nonsense is this what kind of law is this and augustus said i don't know but i feel in my heart that everybody in israel has to return back to their home city not knowing that was god inspiring that unbeliever because only that law brought him them here we have mary and joseph and and both the government and the law and the covet and corona and this and trump and this and her and biden and this and not knowing they were the perfect will of god everybody is in god's hands amen i'm a god lead things supernaturally at the same time there were some some some some precious astronomers over there in babylon and they had to be there but god didn't send an angel but they could see a star and brother we have seen the star and this star never let them to themselves they were not looking just oh what a tremendous star let's make some star photos this star was leading them to the king and we have seen his star can you say amen we have seen the seventh star in the hand of god that was william branham and he was not leading us to jeffersonville or to branham tabernacle he was leading us to the king they say amen amen and at the same time there were some some shepherds and they needed some kind like an invitation and god never used a star but god now changed dimensions because out of an unseen dimension now here come the host of angels singing god portraying the rapture the body change if somebody says uh okay the rapture we will fly in the air geographically and fly uh beside the moon and jupiter okay i respect this but i believe it's a changing of dimensions amen let's go all in the rapture then we would see how it was okay come in i mean never make a doctrine out of these no these are just our thoughts about it so so you see god has tremendous ways his children to lead it's not always an angel it's not always a voice it's not always a light sometimes god leads us without us understanding that it was the leadership of god we find out later and so here we start with that story and i i i have no notes but i always have some pictures which makes it especially for the youngsters a little bit more tangible okay that whole story and if brother joe would help us this this is now the story uh this is uh the mount of olives mount of olives is in the east of jerusalem right in front of this is the mountain that jesus came down with this little donkey first he was sending his disciple to a donkey or two those two donkeys and he said and if somebody asked you [Music] why do you need the donkeys you just say the lord has need of them amen rather for some of the people we are nothing else than donkeys but we would say the lord needs us because he has no other hands than your hands he has no other voice than your voice so let me be a donkey for god i always tell the young people uh because we are not too much of the true message believers i said if you are in school and you're all alone but you're if you're standing true with god then whole heaven is on your side and you're in the majority with god you're always in the majority and so here here he comes down that that that that mountain make the next one please brother joe and here we have the view from mount olives to jerusalem the only thing is what changes the building this is now the omaha mosque but in the time of jesus it was still the temple you're looking from the mount of olives straight to the west through outer court sanctuary up to the holies of holies if the doors were open in the temple you could see from the mount of olives the the curtain between the holy place and the holiest of holies and brother blame said the curtain in that temple symbolizes our self our self will exactly so amen but you're looking straight to the west from the east to the west straight and jesus coming now down that mountain a whole group of people were just waiting for him and brother branham said this he said somewhere for him most were against him and some didn't know exactly i'm trusting that this evening everybody is for him i'm here amen hallelujah amen because when they were waiting he said and now the moment comes when on that hill a little white donkey appears and on that donkey is the king of heaven is the i am in his body certainly we know that amen is the prince of peace and when he was just coming down that mountain therefore i always said when you are when you are teaching when we are teaching i know this is a church who is very well taught therefore i don't have problems to to to to go a little bit in some in some points without getting you nervous because i know that you're very much stable in in stabilizing things but sometimes there is such a confusion is he the lamb or is he the lion i said okay i will not answer it for this evening i wouldn't do but i said who was sitting on that donkey on one hand side it was the lamb because he said behold the lamb of god which takes away the sins of the world but at the same time the prophecy is fulfilled shout jerusalem your king amen at the same time he sees the lamb and the lion right on the same thing it depends on the side of your approach but this is not a doctrinal thing okay this is just for that point never make behind our doctrinal thought a full stop a period just make a comment maybe the picture is bigger than i thought before don't get doctrinated because you're closing your own door always say like your little brother marcus from germany i see that way but maybe i will see it different when i'm learning more when the picture becomes bigger because here he sits on that donkey the lamb of god and the king at the same time blessed be the name of the lord so these people are enthused and they are shouting hosanna those who understood who was sitting on that donkey who told them amen who told them because he was just sitting a man i will not read it but in leviticus it is written you will you have to kill the firstborn of your of your of of of of your of of the donkey and you have to redeem it by a lamb exactly and when these people could see here is a lamb on a donkey they could see this is redemption coming down they could place scripture into their actual life and that was the infusement that they had blessed be the name of the lord so they saw who was sitting on that donkey the redeemer of jerusalem amen they saw it how could they see it through the scripture because jesus had no t-shirt i am the one i am who told them the same who will reveal to you who that seventh messenger was the same holy spirit you if you would have lived 2 000 years ago you would be in that crowd crying hosanna because the same holy spirit who is showing you today the word for this day would have revealed to the day the word for that day god is in humor brother brandon was asked the question brother branham please explain the question i think that was brother joe canada's mother please explain uh the question of matthew i think chapter 10 what is the reward of a prophet and brother branham smiles it's to be a friend of a prophet and he said he becomes handy it became handy for the shunammite woman and brother branham we we know from his life story that one time in memphis tennessee uh that that the plane was just couldn't leave the earth because of that storm brother blame heard the voice and you just go and i'm quoting brother in my from my memory because i don't know if all the words are politically correct but but please understand i'm a hillbilly from germany i don't have all these okay he said but here is he calls her a negro mama and negro mama was just there and he says hello parson and brother brahma said how do you know that i'm a preacher do you understand normally it was brother branham revealing the people your name is eva i see you in the car accident but now that woman is revealing the prophet and brother bran doesn't know who she is but she knows who he is amen and then he said how do you know that i'm that i'm that that i'm a minister she said because i am the shunammite woman and you are the prophet elijah god just turned the picture you say that's tremendous the same thing happened to you who told you the same holy spirit i'm a blessed be the name of the lord do you understand revelation has nothing to do with intel intellect at home i'm a janitor shame of the family but i have a father i have a father i come from another family and my father is proud of me my earthly father said you should have been an engineer with your skills i said i have to be involved my father in the business of my father blessed be the name of the lord so these people when they were seeing the messiah coming down there wouldn't just be oh that that's that's deep brother that's nice that's deep man brother marcus is deep sometimes we have young people that come brother marcus brother so-and-so he was so deep and i said okay and what did you understand nothing yeah that's wonderful but that's that's how it goes i mean and we have to help the people to create a vision but they were so enthused that they took their jacket throwed it on in my preaching i have never seen somebody taking this jacket and throw it on you don't have to but they were so enthused that they took their jackets they knew who was sitting on that donkey it was the king of kings and the lord of lords just in the human flesh blessed be the name of the lord you make the next one please so that is what we want to have is is is is is stimulation by revelation therefore we see that that that christian rock music is entering even in what we call the message of the hour because the people are born bored by the preaching but they're only born because they don't read right amen you have to eat that book and then dan look i was a young boy we were we were not believers we were young we were unbelievers and i i and i know i was a fan at the time of arnold schwarzenegger and sylvester stallone i remember this and i remember arnie he he he comes from austria so he speaks good german so he was in a tv show he was just moving his breasts so i was a small boy i was smaller than the girls in my class and god knows how to how to how to how to humble us i said it last time already i had to i was the only boy who had to swim with the girls you say brother mark that was fine no it was not fine no that that was embarrassing i tell you because everything so i was making bodybuilding and i want to tell the youngsters maybe here's somebody who is that's fine okay but i want to tell you one thing everything that is here today was here it was just changing of dispensation okay it was here okay so so nothing wrong but you have to understand you have to build your soul the rest i wouldn't say waste of time it's fine but but i found out one thing is the natural types the spiritual if you want to have muscles you cannot eat mcdonald's so okay the first row can you say amen the sisters i know this is now death to himself if you want to have muscles you cannot eat mcdonald's you need a steak you need something real and if you want to have spiritual muscles you need you don't need what's up this is social that's fine nothing against let's be social you don't need harry potter you need spiritual food in due seasons blessed be the name of the lord oh there will be a true form and let's reign in the last day upon that little group that come on his little donkey low and humbly no denomination and i always say no denomination in the message or outside of the message because this message will not be a denomination but we will see denominations in the message already this message will never be occult but we see cultish ideas in this and we are not agreeing with that at all the ministry of brotherhood was the eliezer ministry who was connecting us with christ i'm blessed to be the name hosanna to the king that comes in the name of the lord what's the matter today what is the attraction on the mountain what what what was brother brahm now mentioning he's bringing the idea of the mount of olives to sunset mountain in our time amen amen the bible says only the lamb can open the book amen and the voice says to brother brahm go and open the book oh the bible says only land can open the book the voice of you go open the book do we see that sometimes we have even denominational thoughts of of of things because revelation is a book of symbols the voice says go to jefferson and open those seven seals amen amen blessed be the name of the lord i mean make the next one and here we have it here we have it amen what what happened in this day brother brandon said three three years ago it was a prophecy now it's history revelation 10 1-7 is fulfilled therefore we have some people that live in laodicea and we still live in laodicea but brother brahman said in the message paradox in laodicea age there is a new age coming he calls it in ephesians so some people are just living in darkness the only breach we don't have we are blind uh we are miserable we are this but brother the bride is not in loud he's here we're living loud this year all right amen mean therefore we have we have still presidents he's a loser marcus becker low energy man from where does he come from germany and i'm tremendous i mean marcus baker even looks like angela merkel his vision comes from china we are still in that and we respect us and we love that but brother the bride is in bright age why because brother bram says shalom good morning church what does it mean the night is over good morning shalom amen it's the what is it it's the rising of the sun in the hebrew the light begin the new day begins with the night the evening is the beginning of the new day but here is the rising of the sun there's a man who can turn on the light the blood the bride she is not blind she is not miserable she is not wretched the bride she is closed by the garment of the words the bride can say he is here hallelujah so when it comes to politics i don't make sights okay i'm a neutral german so don't take it personally okay amen amen because then i'm surely in a bad position i know like the next one but you take a sense of humor that always helps a little bit so when brother branham came what is the message of brother bryn he is here my message is to declare he's here so when brother branham came on the scene in the beginning of the last century the pentecostal revival was already on there was already divine healing we have these people like like alexander dowie uh we have a ff boss but we have seymour we have i always say this is always a nice comparison the the great general of israel he was the man with the man with one eye bringing israel back to the temple mount and here is he is seymour the man with one eye bringing pentecostal revival so brother blame had didn't have to come to bring pentecost in fact as paul was not in the upper room brother branham was not at pentecost both came later and brother branham said i'm a man called to be born out of season like paul he had to so that the pentecost could fall and we would see the need of the message of the hour so do we understand that this message brought us on a higher level we are preaching things that was never preached in 2000 years ago because revelation 10 is fulfilled christ is here we're waiting for meeting him in the air that's true but christ is here blessed be the name of the lord so so the healing revival is going on all these things and make the next one please and then we see how church became an entertainment he said 1959 and brother sister i have been back in the cave long enough and you have to to know that there has been a lot of earthquakes shaking around a lot of noise and fusses and stews and things like that and big meetings but where has been god out of it that's the reason i said what i said this morning there has to come something deeper than a healing service there has to come something deeper than the gift of speaking in tongues there has to become something deeper than a rushing mighty wind what followed it a still small voice and brother said the prophet elijah he was he was not shaken by nothing so please don't come and say brother marcus and here's a healing gift and he comes through america and this and this happened and you have to say so what so what that's fine we appreciate this but our attraction is not a gift anymore it's not a ministry anymore brother marcus who do you think he's the man of the hour i know one thing christ is the man of the hour for the bride amen so we see that that that that that for example let caller name our most noble brother oral roberts he had 50 television channels therefore we had to collect all the money and at the at a certain time it was not enough that that it was just preached but they needed some kind like a like a good singer because people wanted to have a little bit christian entertainment so they brought people in like like uh pat boone and so forth and it took away the sincerity of the people the honesty the thing of being between life and death with your god the cry for we have to get it lord give me that revelation like we were praying in the beginning give me the holy ghost we will not say okay if not lord then no no lord i need the holy ghost and you have to say one thing lord i need growth in my life [Applause] because one thing was sure these pentecostals were good men but god tell brother branham he said you cannot teach pentecostal babies supernatural thing that is what so they were born again if not you cannot be a baby but you can but god will not marry a little baby this bride who goes into the rapture will be a full bride she knows who she is she knows where she stands she is not shaken by nothing blessed being a lord amen did you ever notice that no there was not one gift not one prophet in the denominations or in the message were warning us from kovitt nobody said in two years the churches will be closed this happens we see ministers dying or passing away do you think god doesn't know what he does god wants us to learn to be prepared whatever comes our way we are br we're ready whatever comes our way because when kovite 19 ends kovy 20 will arrive and we must come to a place that we say whatever comes lord i'm ready amen it is not the situation who will master me i will master the situation blessed be the name of the lord so there must come something deeper you may please the next one this is at the end of the 50s so therefore you see my little little little sense of humor it's not only in the u.s especially in germany because we were here this is the place in nuremberg where adolf hitler was making his great speeches and these german soldiers when you see them thousands of making the same movement and so so what we did we were with some young people there now on that picture you see some young of our some young people of our church and there was a charismatic church and uh no they were all in in mini skirts and so i'm very happy for photoshop so i could cut everything out that is not fitting for a message church okay so thanks be to god for powerpoint and photoshop and all these things that makes it possible but there was quite a difference but what happened is this so i had my bible with me and we were right at the place where hitler was declaring his millennium you see the millennium is not for the germans it's for the bride okay so some of the germans will be there i hope so okay but look and i hold up the bible like this and i said this hitler is dead but jesus lives and everybody was clapping and here comes a pastor he said oh are you christian he said we are christians and he says do you love israel he said we love israel that's wonderful and he says i'm the pastor of the charismatic church in in nuremberg and so we made a picture together with message believers and with the charismatic church so let me say in for 10 minutes i was in the ecomedical movement but then i heard the eagles cry come out of babylon and i came out again okay but why shouldn't we respect people because we're not changing them let them brother blame said god have dollars and god have sins and pennies he says let these pennies be pennies and then brother bram said this he said god uses them why should i let everybody be this is this is time of harvest everybody shows his colors anyhow so you see somebody just respect him wish him god's blessings and go for it we don't have to waste our time to holler against the baptist and this no let's we we are bright age we let's go forward a little bit in these things blessed be the name anyhow gospel is always good news and there will be people getting their reward on the white throne judgment and i say god bless you for this amen recipe so so we make a little picture and he gave me his card so the next thing comes i mean but yeah now here is his card from his church and he says in my own words she said uh great services uh modern life music music dynamic youth work and and ant okay so in their church they don't have a pulpit this is a charismatic church and if you see a charismatic church it's two hours singing 15 minutes preaching and then two hours worshiping about the 50 minutes what they heard it's a miracle to do this but they don't do in between that three times take an offering i mean honestly honestly and and they make it openly they put it right in front and everybody comes in [Music] okay that's how it goes so they don't have a pulpit and i always say they don't need a pulpit because they have nothing just nothing to say but they have let me say if this this is how it is okay no pulpit and on their visiting card they have directly the mark of the mcdonald's right where the next methodology is so they can tell the young people look we go to church but children he's only preaching 15 minutes but then we go for burgers okay yeah okay this is okay that's fine i heard it about the church of hillsong i mean these people are clever hillsong make a real youth program during the service and the children say mama we want to go to church because they have disneyland they have all kinds of things but i want to say honestly brother i know children are children and let us have a lot of patience with our children let us wait until god gets them that's them and sometimes a church stuff is boring for them i know this okay unless you make little jokes in the beginning or you look them in the face and say okay then it goes okay but it's not okay but sooner or later you have to catch them by the word if the word does not keep them in church nothing will keep them in church you will just keep them by entertainment you make it just a new lodge just a new club just a new association we are the uh good luck brothers or we are the uh happy uh always happy bowling game team or whatever this is look brother we have to pay attention that our young people don't become religious in the message they need the holy spirit and sometimes you take a family and you see the children and and they're just on the photos and we say and this is the model family but some of the model families is just rich young rulers they were never born again they know how to behave themselves in church right from their use this is what the rich young ruler says brother this is dangerous because when the word tests come they cannot stand the test because everything is just the outside the outside is important but it's not the main thing the main thing must be the heart of a person i mean sometimes you can have a very perfect house and you have an arrogant spirit it will never bring you forth brother blame said if you want to continue with god never allow an arrogant spirit to lead you listen okay next one please so what happens is this here is brother branham and he says and it just picked me up and took me up and you remember that he said there must come something deeper and why up where a meeting was going on on looked like a tent or a cathedral of some sort and i looked and there was a little box like little place over on the side and i seen that light talking to somebody above me that light that you see over on the picture it worked away from me like that and went over to that tent and said i will meet you there and said this will be the third poll and you won't tell nobody and in sabino canyon he said this is the third pool now i give now my view and it's a biblical view if this is the whole picture because we know prophecies have compound meanings we respect this but i think here is a good approach now the pillar of fire went over some tent or some cathedral and the voice says to brother branham i will meet you there remember it's a vision visions can be natural fulfillments like marilyn monroe are symbolic fulfillments like pharaoh and the seven cows that was just a symbol or they have a spiritual application like nebuchadnezzar and the statue was pure spiritual applications sometimes it's natural sometimes it's symbolic to take something spiritual natural brings you in problem because we have precious brothers in south america they are now building a big tent in order to fulfill the tenth meeting the tenth vision and we have it in youtube when they say oh and now we are fulfilling here what brother brandt think in costa rica we are fulfilling what brother branham said he will come to a big tent in a little cathedral and i always tell this if the tent that brother bram saw in that vision is a natural tent now if the tent is in germany then good night [Laughter] and if the tent is in the u.s then there is only one which get blessed lufthansa i mean that's what one of the of the brothers said brother brother marcus you have to come to this and this convention to get rapturing faith i said the only one who's blessed is lufthansa because rapturing faces in the message of the hour brother not in a special convention forget that idea you brought it from denominations right in it amen so the question is where is the tent okay this is one aspect there's a lot of answers to this okay and i will not dare to give an interpretation to to something what the prophet said but i think when we bring it biblically we can have an idea okay so make the next one please brother joe now now who was the first one who had a tent vision that was moses because moses was taking up into heaven and he sees the heavenly temple and when he comes down he shall he he was told to build a tabernacle according to the vision that he had in heaven he was the first one having a tent vision and he builds it and then and and solomon was building his temple exactly according to the vision that moses had because it was god's vision and it was the messenger of our hour of our day who revealed what that means that temple is the human being that is a human because because nothing is made in the image of god than just men brother brother respect every man on earth even if he's a muslim even if it's a bump on the street you say this is nothing else this is another this is just a bump and uh he's not a message believer he's nothing i can walk over him remember that bump that vagabond he is the son of a mother and for her it's her son and maybe she is the daddy of a little girl and for her this man is daddy brother you're never wrong in respecting people you're never wrong you don't have to agree with all things but shake everybody's hand wish them well even even in the messages this is the man no he said wish them well god bless you amen brother marcus we have some an idea and now we have the man of the hour and here comes the new wave he said god bless you which we will see the effects if it's god's behind we will see the fruit amen blessed be the name of the lord so so moses had a tent vision and what was it it was the human being it was body spirit soul in a man blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah let me let me let me let me make the next one please cringing five one i i read it in english the long longer verse sorry is it second corinthians 5. just give me a second gentlemen yeah for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens that is our theophany that is sure that's what the prophet said he said if our earthly house of this tabernacle another translation said of this tent for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be closed upon with our house which is from heaven for we that are in this tabernacle and the german sensation in this tent do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclosed but closed upon that mortality might be swallowed up in life so remember one thing i'm a very sympathetic type of person very honestly if you only would know me because i live in a german tent with german genes and germs therefore germany many germs that goes along okay fits together standing in my own way having my complexes having my traumas having standing in my own way but this is only my tent my real me the real man who i am is on the inside and if this tent is dissolved i'm stepping into my theophany and you stepping in your theophany that is the real you that is your real personality therefore we are standing in our own way we live in a tabernacle but just for a little period of time we live in a tent but just for 70 80 years maybe a little bit more but just the average but from there is not the end we are entering into a building of god blessed be the name of the lord what is the difference between a theophany and and a sinner who goes into some kind like a body a theophany is a part of god it's part of the word itself blessed be the name of the lord next one please therefore we're reading a psalm of david the lord is my light and brother brandon preaches in the rapture of my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and the foes came upon me to eat upon my flesh they stumbled and fell and so forth one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle of his tent hallelujah amen what is it in time of trouble your own theophany will come because we know that if our earthly body will be dissolved we have not maybe god will construct something just before we die it's there we know it's there i always say this when when the time for the rapture was for elijah it was not elijah searching the chariot it was the chariot searching elijah and on that chariot was a name and nobody could enter hallelujah gospel is good news therefore brother branham was with the christian businessman and he we know the difference between assurance and insurance and and he says brother brandon what is your what is your business you have assurance and he said mine is insured insurance and the person said to brother brandon my insurance will take you to the grave and brother brahm said and my assurance will take you out of it [Laughter] amen blessed be the name of the lord brother i i will not preach about this evening but it's a tremendous statement that brother brandon made i know i can make fanaticism out of it but let the message stand what the messenger said he said quickening power brought me behind the curtain of time and i saw all of you there that is something tremendous therefore that woman at the well she was in such a terrible condition but she had a representation before god she did not get representation because jesus went by but jesus went by because she had representation she was born with that representation but then life came brother brandon explained how she was a young girl she was mistreated by one of the husbands and they are the first husband and then she was throwing away her life but all the time she had representation right before god blessed be the name of the lord our gospel is not you know sometime we feel saved we feel good sometimes we feel even the bright yeah we feel really good okay but sometimes we feel nothing amen amen but god cannot go after our feelings god had made an eternal decision feelings here are no feelings blessed be the name of the lord next one please i'm i'm hurrying through amen here we go amen here now the tenth vision don't search in south america don't search in tucson don't search in jeffersonville why don't you search here why don't you think the bride is the tent amen maybe it's different maybe i'm wrong but i believe i'm i'm not too wrong about this i don't believe i'm too right or wrong with this you understand then that means the revival is in me the rapture is in me i mean i don't need superman to come and here comes superman i mean have a super preaching and he says okay you know one thing everything to take me home lays in me lays in the seeds blessed be the name of the lord how do you know now who know who who who showed you what happened in these days not only god sent a prophet because our roberts knew that god sent a prophet benny hinn says brilliant branham was a prophet but you can identify what happened on sunset mountain back in the scripture and you see it in your own life blessed be the name of the lord you are the group that would stand there at mount olives and would say hosanna to the king amen blessed be the name so so here we have these three men and they were just following the stars and finishing by this three astronomers they have seen the star brother i take a lot of care of people who are coming back to church i have a little outreach and we've got plenty of young people went into the world and we see them coming back but they always come back marred sometime with a baby without out of out of the holy wedlock sometimes in drugs sometimes in alcohol but they try to find their way back i said look you have to pay for all your nonsense that you did but if you want to come back to god it's our duty to give you a hand hey you can have my hand okay and i see brother sister i see how the word of the lord slowly but surely changed the persons amen a young a young person we have different ones and even brother when we talk about suicide of young people it's not out of out of the message it's part of of our community today ten years ago we would have never believed that but today we see this part of our community we have to deal with all these things amen and and and because i'm dealing with some of them and one of them is back and he's now starting to preach i mean and everybody says brother marcus who laid hands on that boy i said nobody but i was just telling him i said you just sit there and let the word of the lord change your heart you just believe what is said and you see your true identity who you are and from that on you will leave the things of the world you know it's not part of you that was one of the smokers he said brother mike i want to get quit of smoking i said look if you have the desire it's already god's starting because he gives a desire and he's a fulfillment i said you have to understand you're a child of god but you were trapped in all kind of nonsense the moment you understand who you are you would say it has it is not part of me and then it has no grip anymore on you automatically and and we see i see what brother branham preaches the transforming power is in the word of the lord not conform these people but let the word show them who they are and and then slowly but surely blessed be the name of the lord it is a process it's not that superman comes and another altar called he says no you make it step by step and we see us in one year from here and you will be a different person blessed be the name of the lord this message that we believe has transforming power never forget it it's not a doctrine of william branham no amen because it's it comes from our father so when they were just going and they were just following the stars they entered into jerusalem and they said one thing said where is the king of the jews and brother branham explains people have spirits don't forget it you a wrong you you go along with the right kind of people and you lose the vision for the star because brother abraham said when they entered into jerusalem they were mixing with the pharisees and sadducees and when they did this they didn't see the star anymore it was just the influence of those people blessed be the name of the lord and when they left israel and when they left jerusalem and they left the company of those people brother brahim said they could see the star again you have to choose your company i always say this brother if you are around people that doesn't like marcus becker immediate i'm too far away so that you have to love me because i'm on the other side of the ocean even if i'm a loser no no problem if i'm a loser okay but i'm far away okay but if you are around people that hate that hate marcus becker if you're around these people one day you will hate marcus becker you don't know why it is the anointing of those people stay away from people who always have something to say i tell the young people there's two things with no tolerance in our lives we have a lot of toilets we must have tolerance today but no tolerance in immorality zero tolerance and when it comes to speak bad about preachers do you have to directly put on the phone he said we're not talking about that thing because this must be an evil spirit can you say amen amen absolutely so so they came and they saw again the star so when they followed the star jesus was already two years old so they now brought gifts and the gifts were the expression of their revelation because you bring gifts to two years but all boys you go to toys r us sure but here the first one comes and i can see him kneeling down putting gold there why does he bring gold because he knows one thing this is the king this is the king he knows who who is between that little boy this is the king the second one has revelation two he brings mirror he said you will you will die for our sins and the third one what was the third fragrance fragrances fragrances exactly therefore i said donkey you understand why i said donkey yeah because it's very tricky america english can be very very tricky especially if you have the kind of a real german accent like me and that is always difficult okay i mean fragrances brought it there because you will have a life of service presence reveals the revelation of these three the way we treat the message of the hour shows our revelation can you say amen i mean i had some time a little boy i was new in the sunday school and we had some boys there coming like this to church organ and i did not know who the parents were i didn't dare to ask but one day i saw some people coming to the sanctuary i tell you the way we come they come where will they learn respect from us where will they learn love from us sometimes there's even ministers they cannot forget i said brother preaching is a gift but character is more than just a gift of good talking amen somehow cannot forgive some cannot ask for forgiveness it's ego it's a human pride brother we are we we have to make an example before that young generation that they can say i don't that they would say i don't understand the doctrine but i want to have what my father has what my mother has this is can you say amen amen blessed be the name of the lord and i know i'm talking from this wednesday evening to people he said brother mark is where i am in the picture i want to say one thing did you see his star can you say amen that you are one of these three they are portrayed in you we were one of those three that followed star amen do we saw do we have we seen the other dimension that's right sure god was so great that he even showed the picture of brother branham with the pillar of fire we always say this is brother brandon was the pillar of fire brother ram said god wanted to make a picture of himself and he just allowed that i'm on the picture too that means we are we are those we are those those shepherds we were just in the things of the world and here comes a supernatural thing we are those shepherds say brother marcus where are we no are we married who is married certainly that christ is born in our hearts let your word be born in the manger of my heart so you are the manger you're mary you're the manger you are the shepherds you are the three astronomers you are joseph because you protect the message there's a quote of brother burns he said protect the message i tell you one thing one day rahab was protecting the messengers and brother bram said it was two tape boys later the message protected the family of rahab it matters to serve the lord god remembers yes and some of the young then you're the people who was in that in the in in that uh how he said in the in that christmas picture he said okay then i'm the donkey too that's fine but all these scriptures speak of us it's our story the bible became a new book blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah so where is the tent amen i don't know if this was the final answer to everything no i will not say but i believe this was one aspect please don't look there look there look there why don't you look here i will meet you there i will meet you here i'm it's the voice of your father if the musicians would come and hardly it was my great honor to just i had no notes the gesture but please okay do you have the nice song he's got it all in control he's got it uh oh i have a father that's very fine i have a or as the deer pants for the water is that fine if we have a song together you maybe see this sister that's fine only if it's fine for you brothers so let me finish by by by the last thought i put everything what what number is it sixth word which that which which song that's very nice you remember that brother brahms speak about the mighty man around david mighty in the message there's a man who can turn on the light amen and he says these men were all gentiles and brother bremen gets excused he said they were not jews they were gentiles the mighty men they were fighters they were soldiers they were they were navy seals they came yeah many of you know don't know i was in as a boy i was in the french foreign legion i was a legionary for some time but god changed my heart god changed my heart for his glory amen they were fighters but they love david they love david love is not an emotion love is a substance and when david just said i wish to have a drink from the well in bethlehem he did not command he didn't know so you you you go but brother abraham said the least of his thoughts the least of his wishes were a command for david for these men because they were so much in love and when david came to his power all these men came into their power and here's what brother brahm said and this refers to you because you are one of these mighty men in this loudly seeing age to hold a stand is something very precious for god to live today a godly life is more difficult than ever before don't forget it amen you say brother marcus i i could not bring nobody to the lord i want to say you are the trophy you are the trophy right you bring yourself to the lord lest on the white throne judgment we will see how the bride can intercede into certain different situations we have a young brother in our church nobody comes to church nor his wife nor his children i said and you serve the lord because you will not help them by becoming worldly you serve the lord with all your heart and you will see them on the white throne judgment and you will be sitting there and there you will be an intercessor like esther but then brother brahman finished really about this he said this this man knew that david would come into power one day and let the world make fun of the message of this of this we know what it is can you say amen somebody some somebody [Applause] somebody wants to argue with me and brother branham you know brother marcus you know and and the ohio river bridge and so forth i said brother stop you come too late amen because i see the effect of this message in my life brother honestly you come too late please don't waste your time don't waste my time i know this message has transforming power can you say amen if you if you see it it's a great treasure that you have it brings you inequality with the bible characters here you are in the bible here's your name the same holy spirit who revealed to them revealed to us that makes us brothers it seems that we have the same father amen amen hallelujah amen god bless you my brother [Music] panteth for the water so my soul don't get that deep you [Music] i my [Music] [Music] desire and i love to worship you you are my friend and you are my brother you are afraid i want you more than any other so much more than anything for you alone are my strengths my sheep you [Music] now while the music is softly playing why the music is softly playing let's bow our heads and um [Music] i would just say if you feel in your heart to say to serve the lord and he said and you want to just take his hand and say heavenly father i need a vision i have to not to be just i'm in a message church i need that vision that my life is inspired to do things for you and you want it in your life you can just raise your hands to your father say heavenly father bring me in that circle of people who have clear vision of me and my house we serve the lord as a housewife as a brother as a sister heavenly father so we thank you for this moment of consecrating right before you and may you take every hand in every heart and lead us father guide us father you started our journey with us may you just give us growth lord if there is something in our way that is hindering you may you just take it away father by the holy spirit father if you are somebody who feels that he is not serving the lord as he should do father may you just touch his heart in that moment of sincerity and say my son just take my hand i will help you in all the dead ends that you're in father hey you help the young people to hold the ford father to catch that vision to go forward that this message is not a religion to them but that it's them their their father speaking to them that they would say it's our way it's my way it's a pleasure to walk with the lord father in heaven we know you're the same yesterday today and forever and we live in difficult times but when the enemy comes in like a flood the lord will raise up a standard against it may you do it in every family in every heart for the glory of god and father once again we want to ask for our noble pastor may you bless him father in his health father may you bless his family father may you bless the associate ministers that are here by the way and brother the different brothers that are here may you bless the musicians in every family that is represented and father may you bless your children israel because those who bless israel they are blessed father and so we thank you father for this evening and may your name be glorified ask it in jesus name amen shalom shalom [Music] [Applause] [Music] i want you more [Music] i want you more than gold or silver only you can say [Music] for you [Applause] [Music] you alone
