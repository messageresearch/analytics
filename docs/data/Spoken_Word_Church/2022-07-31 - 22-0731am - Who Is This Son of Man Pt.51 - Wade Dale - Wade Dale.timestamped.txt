[8:14] the ones that are traveling different
[8:15] ones
[8:16] we ask in jesus name
[8:18] amen
[8:20] who is this son of man part 51
[8:24] john 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was
[8:26] the word the word was with god
[8:28] and the word was god give them a minute
[8:30] they'll get it up there
[8:32] and the word was made flesh
[8:35] and dwelt among there you go and the
[8:37] word was made flesh
[8:39] and dwelt among us now as we've been
[8:41] talking i want you to understand that is
[8:43] you
[8:45] that is your flesh being made word all
[8:48] right now remember it didn't come word
[8:50] for him as
[8:53] bob's bob's gonna have to quit what he's
[8:54] doing he just got to stop just don't do
[8:56] it no more we'll let somebody else teach
[8:58] you
[8:59] because i was sitting back there and i
[9:00] would i was thinking i thought well how
[9:02] can i take that theophany from a from a
[9:05] ball of light
[9:06] and bring it down into us and then of
[9:08] course he puts it on the screen
[9:10] that's god because we don't discuss that
[9:12] that's god that does that
[9:14] so we must need that
[9:16] we must need it when a teacher goes down
[9:17] a line or somebody goes down the line
[9:19] and they haven't discussed yet they all
[9:21] fit together then that's needful for all
[9:23] of us that was needful for me and
[9:24] everyone else amen and the word was made
[9:26] flesh and dwelt among us we behold his
[9:28] glory the glory of the only begotten of
[9:29] the father
[9:30] full of grace and truth because remember
[9:32] we haven't seen the father but the
[9:34] father was displayed in the sun and now
[9:36] the sun is being displayed into what in
[9:38] the bride
[9:39] all right
[9:40] romans 12 verse 2 says be not conformed
[9:42] to this world but be transformed by the
[9:45] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[9:47] that you may prove
[9:49] you may prove
[9:52] what is that good and acceptable and
[9:54] perfect
[9:55] will of god for i say through the grace
[9:56] given unto me to every man that is among
[9:58] you not to think of himself more highly
[10:00] than he ought to think but to think
[10:02] soberly according as god had dealt to
[10:04] every man
[10:05] the measure
[10:07] of faith we'll stop right there and
[10:08] you'll be seated lord has blessings
[10:10] we're going to cover that a little bit
[10:11] further
[10:12] about this measure of faith because
[10:14] every age had a measure of faith
[10:16] everybody
[10:17] every everybody is not going to have to
[10:19] come to the body change because there's
[10:20] people that there's thousands and
[10:22] thousands and hundreds of thousands and
[10:24] probably millions of people bride that
[10:27] are laying in a grave somewhere that
[10:29] their bodies already pretty much rotted
[10:32] and gone and turned into dust but
[10:34] there's a soul over in a dimension
[10:35] somewhere that's waiting on me and you
[10:38] to come to some place
[10:40] of perfection
[10:42] they came to perfection in the soul
[10:44] they got the perfect love they got the
[10:46] agape love under their church age
[10:48] messenger
[10:50] i'll read it in just a second remember
[10:53] the holy ghost in every age it goes to
[10:55] the messenger message messenger and then
[10:58] we live it we'll read it in just a
[10:59] minute
[11:00] but let's read first corinthians 13
[11:02] verse 1 it says do i speak with the
[11:04] tongue of men and angels and have not
[11:05] charity i have become a sounding brass
[11:08] and a tinkling symbol
[11:10] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[11:12] and understand all mysteries well that's
[11:14] pretty good and all knowledge and though
[11:16] i have all faith
[11:18] so that i could remove mountains and
[11:19] have not charity i am nothing remember
[11:22] the prophet of god tells us that satan
[11:24] can pass out supernatural gifts
[11:27] all right so be careful if you want if
[11:28] you're looking for gifts
[11:30] i thought the bible says signs
[11:32] follow the believer so the signs are
[11:35] behind you they're following you through
[11:37] your life you're the one that's blazing
[11:39] the trail you're the one that's the god
[11:41] in front of those gifts they won't work
[11:43] without you
[11:45] but let's don't seek for them
[11:47] let them follow us
[11:48] all right so brother brown said signs
[11:50] follow
[11:51] the believer
[11:52] and though i bestow all my goods to feed
[11:54] the poor this is a pretty good guy this
[11:56] is a message believer
[11:58] and though i give my body to be burned
[12:00] and have not charity it profiteth me
[12:03] nothing now what does charity mean
[12:05] that's not giving out food that's not
[12:07] taking care of the poor in this case
[12:10] right here we take that as charity but
[12:12] look the bible tells us it's agape love
[12:15] all right which is that love at the top
[12:17] of the pyramid but you got to have it at
[12:18] the bottom
[12:19] to begin with all right brotherly love
[12:22] affection good will love benevolence
[12:26] not the love you have for your wife not
[12:27] the love you have for your brother not
[12:29] to love now you need to have agape love
[12:31] for your brother
[12:33] you got me
[12:34] but that's not
[12:36] the lustful love that you have for for
[12:40] your wife and you say yeah well that's
[12:41] what it is
[12:43] feel your love is the love you have and
[12:46] its own condition whether you love me or
[12:47] not if you don't love me i ain't gonna
[12:48] love you
[12:50] but brother branham says that's not
[12:52] agape love agape love is you love them
[12:54] anyway
[12:55] love those who despitefully use you love
[12:57] those who are against you it's easy to
[13:00] love somebody that loves you
[13:02] it's easy to love somebody that's just
[13:03] oh you're so good and you're so great
[13:06] but when somebody says i got an issue
[13:08] with you
[13:09] and you're like why what is it
[13:11] well we're going to say temperance
[13:13] patience all of the statue of perfect
[13:16] man in just a little while if we ever
[13:17] get to it
[13:18] but we i want to make sure i was praying
[13:20] a couple days ago
[13:22] i said lord i want to make sure
[13:23] everybody's born again
[13:26] if you're not born again you will not
[13:28] understand what i'm talking about
[13:30] and let me tell you something
[13:32] as i said before
[13:35] god's grace is good god's arm is long as
[13:38] sister
[13:39] sister uh
[13:40] um gail used to say god's arm is long
[13:43] amen but there's an end to it
[13:46] god's not a greasy grace god he's not a
[13:48] god he's the god of justice
[13:50] he's a god that says all right i've
[13:52] given you the word i've give you
[13:53] somebody to talk to you about it i've
[13:54] given you an opportunity to get it and
[13:56] if you don't get it this is what you're
[13:58] going to get you're going to get
[13:59] judgment
[14:01] and you know who's you who the problem
[14:03] is you
[14:04] you're the one that's going to make the
[14:06] tribulation period god's not going to
[14:07] make you make the tribulation period
[14:09] you're going to make it yourself
[14:12] i got myself a note
[14:15] think about this as we go along put your
[14:17] faith in what
[14:20] put your faith in what what are you
[14:22] putting your faith in you job
[14:29] brother suresh
[14:32] i think brother uh dutch scots
[14:34] worked for this company for years and
[14:36] years and years made real good money i
[14:37] walked in one day and said we're doing
[14:38] away with your job
[14:40] he's had to start all over and he's 50
[14:42] years old probably got a wife with
[14:44] cancer
[14:46] hello you gonna put your faith in that
[14:49] gonna put your faith in your
[14:51] car
[14:52] you gonna put your faith in your family
[14:58] you better put your faith in god
[15:00] and we'll we'll talk about a little bit
[15:02] more this afternoon because we have to
[15:04] we've got to hone this faith thing down
[15:07] well i believe in i believe in well you
[15:10] better be careful there's only one faith
[15:12] one lord
[15:13] one baptism all right one not many
[15:16] faiths it is the faith
[15:18] of the son of god so there's only one
[15:20] thing we can put our whole being into
[15:23] and i'll read it to you in just a minute
[15:24] where brother brown says face final
[15:25] resting places where in the word of god
[15:28] not in a study book not in james dobson
[15:31] not in good news for modern men
[15:33] it's in god
[15:35] and your faith
[15:37] listen to me you got up this morning i
[15:40] hope
[15:42] you got up this morning and put your
[15:44] faith in that you're going to learn
[15:46] something from god today when you come
[15:48] to church not that you're going to just
[15:50] show up because i'm going to talk about
[15:51] you if you don't
[15:54] praise god anyway
[15:56] i probably will
[15:58] but i'm just telling you what the bible
[15:59] says i'm not telling you what my my idea
[16:01] this whole thing is
[16:03] if you don't go to church you're lost
[16:05] period i don't care who you are
[16:08] you show me the bible where you can go
[16:10] to church every once in a while
[16:14] show it to me
[16:16] if we're going to put faith final
[16:17] resting places in the word of god
[16:20] then whatever that word of god says
[16:22] listen we've been restored back we're
[16:24] not to where we don't know if there's
[16:27] three gods or one or we don't know if if
[16:29] hell is eternal or we don't know where
[16:30] we're going we know these things
[16:33] and knowing these things
[16:35] my
[16:37] i come to church like coming to school
[16:39] some of y'all didn't like going to
[16:40] school
[16:41] that's okay
[16:42] but i did you know why because i wanted
[16:44] to learn something so if you got the
[16:46] holy ghost the holy ghost wants to learn
[16:48] i i'm going to read it to you to man
[16:50] where god said he's going to put the
[16:51] teacher in
[16:52] when he puts the teacher in it draws you
[16:55] to being taught
[16:57] by what
[16:58] the word of god
[17:02] and you're just an unbeliever if you
[17:03] don't come to church
[17:05] period don't fool yourself i was reading
[17:07] a quote a few minutes ago brother brown
[17:08] said let's not fool ourselves
[17:10] if you're lost just say i'm lost
[17:12] because you know what he will he will go
[17:14] by your confession
[17:16] well i'm saved because mama was saved
[17:17] i'm saved because daddy was safe i
[17:19] listened to two tapes back in 1995.
[17:22] ought to be all right
[17:24] no you ain't all right
[17:27] it's got to be something where you want
[17:29] to come to church you want to listen to
[17:31] god you don't want
[17:32] you know what
[17:34] brother baby said you know what he said
[17:35] one time he said we don't want to come
[17:36] to church to see each other he said if
[17:38] you want to talk to your brother and
[17:40] fellowship with him he said do it
[17:41] outside
[17:43] that's why we don't talk in the church
[17:44] and carry on conversations like
[17:45] denomination they just get up start
[17:47] talking about everything in the world in
[17:48] the congregation no we come in here to
[17:50] what push all that out
[17:53] let the devil be uncomfortable being in
[17:55] here let god be so much in here that he
[17:57] just don't want to be here amen
[18:00] but you got to be born again
[18:03] have faith
[18:04] and be born again
[18:07] not have faith
[18:08] and just say well
[18:10] i
[18:11] i got to be saved why no
[18:15] i pray every day
[18:17] brother dale's 82 years old he prays
[18:19] every day for the lord to fill him with
[18:21] the holy ghost because he always has and
[18:23] the same thing with us lord fill me up
[18:25] if i'm not saved save me because that's
[18:28] my confession
[18:30] but if i walk in and say well bless god
[18:32] i've got it all it's all right here i'm
[18:33] up there at the top and everything's
[18:35] fine i'm just good
[18:37] and you're
[18:38] in for
[18:40] some issues
[18:42] i was gonna say something else but
[18:44] you're in for some issues
[18:46] right amen
[18:48] so we just need to be sober
[18:51] humble
[18:52] going off the statue of perfect man will
[18:53] humble you revelation will humble you it
[18:56] will not make your head swell up
[18:59] because why in the world with something
[19:01] eternal give you that revelation that's
[19:03] the way i look at why did you give it to
[19:04] me lord why
[19:06] you didn't have to
[19:08] but you did
[19:10] you gave me the new birth you know why
[19:12] because i wanted it
[19:15] i wanted to get out of the filth of this
[19:17] world
[19:19] so we have to go through our stages and
[19:21] we've been through this over and over
[19:22] again but like i said before i want
[19:23] somebody born again i want somebody that
[19:26] wants the word of god more than they
[19:28] want to eat
[19:30] some of us are not showing that
[19:34] but i can eat and love god too
[19:36] amen and all of us says
[19:38] amen
[19:40] but put your faith in what
[19:43] you put your faith in the doctors
[19:46] all they have is a book
[19:49] that says this and you know what it says
[19:51] on the front of it
[19:52] practice
[19:54] right
[19:55] you go see a doctor you go see him at
[19:57] his practice
[20:00] god has never in his life practiced
[20:04] he's always been right
[20:07] he's always made the right decision and
[20:09] he's standing there going hey
[20:11] i've got this book right here that
[20:13] doesn't say practice
[20:15] it says holy
[20:18] bible
[20:19] and it's the eternal word of god written
[20:21] before the foundational world he said
[20:22] just go buy it
[20:24] that's our issue we just don't go by it
[20:26] all of us
[20:29] somebody was talking to you the other
[20:30] day
[20:31] you know the denominational world
[20:32] there's people out there that are good
[20:33] people
[20:34] they love god as much as they can
[20:37] and they're in a system though that they
[20:39] can't get everything they need brother
[20:41] brown said they can't get all the way
[20:42] out they get out so far
[20:44] and they can't get all the way out but
[20:46] you and i don't have that excuse you and
[20:48] i are at a place a position right now
[20:51] today
[20:53] to understand it from genesis to
[20:54] revelations and not have a problem with
[20:56] what the bible says amen
[20:59] not have a problem i said with what the
[21:01] bible says
[21:02] about everything raising your kids
[21:04] dressing right eating right doing right
[21:07] coming to church
[21:10] respect
[21:12] for as many are led by the spirit of god
[21:14] they are the sons of god for you have
[21:16] not received the spirit of bondage again
[21:18] to fear but you have what received the
[21:19] spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a
[21:22] father the spirit of self bearing
[21:24] witness with our spirit what that we are
[21:26] the children of god and of children than
[21:28] heirs we're going to cover some of that
[21:29] this afternoon listen if if if jesus
[21:34] was god
[21:35] right here's god right
[21:38] right is that right
[21:40] jesus is a god
[21:41] not a second person
[21:43] then if so be if we're joint hairs with
[21:46] god
[21:47] that makes us good
[21:50] that's too close no it's not close
[21:52] enough
[21:53] i told you we've become a bunch of tunis
[21:55] people where it's bride and christ we
[21:58] gotta see one when god walked in the air
[22:00] in the garden with adam and eve he saw
[22:02] one person
[22:04] and her name was adam before the fall
[22:07] the only separation was when she did
[22:09] what she did and god had to
[22:11] pull her apart not pull her out of that
[22:13] but pull her apart from the from what
[22:15] he's told him to do and set her over
[22:17] here and put her under different
[22:18] conditions all right
[22:20] i was asked that question the other day
[22:22] at work they were talking about the
[22:23] methodist church you know the methodist
[22:25] church is splitting now because
[22:27] they're wanting to have gay um
[22:30] gay preachers or whatever they call them
[22:31] priests gay pastors
[22:33] and women and it doesn't matter if
[22:34] you're a woman to gay or if you're gay
[22:36] and they say well what's wrong with that
[22:37] i said don't ever ask me that question
[22:39] again
[22:42] it all began in genesis
[22:46] well that's the old testament i said
[22:48] let's go to the new testament and paul
[22:49] said i
[22:51] tell you by the word of the lord a
[22:53] woman's not supposed to speak in church
[22:55] you're not supposed to have anything to
[22:56] do i'm sorry if it hurts your feelings
[23:00] that's you know why our problem is we
[23:02] try to worship christ
[23:06] somebody saying man
[23:08] we try to urge your authority over
[23:10] christ well we don't believe everything
[23:12] in here we don't have to do everything
[23:13] you tell us to do
[23:14] right
[23:17] if children deny the heirs of god and
[23:19] join heirs with christ if so be that we
[23:21] suffer with him that we may be glorified
[23:23] together listen we want to get out of
[23:24] here we got to get all the t's
[23:27] dotted and the eyes
[23:30] peace crosstalk dotted amen
[23:33] we
[23:34] good i figured i fixed that
[23:38] huh
[23:42] some did someone's like okay
[23:46] i might brother dale i but he never did
[23:48] it but he said he was going to do it
[23:50] he's going to come up here and just
[23:51] preach something false off the wall and
[23:53] nobody and see how many people's going
[23:54] to amend it
[23:59] that still may be in the arsenal
[24:03] all right so we we got to start
[24:04] somewhere so we started justification
[24:07] we go to justification which is what
[24:09] is is asking god to forgive you of your
[24:12] sins yes
[24:15] i mean that whole pile load that you had
[24:17] back in bc before christ
[24:20] amen
[24:21] and if if he if you're asking him really
[24:24] asking him he's going to put it in the
[24:26] sea of god's forgetfulness never to be
[24:28] remembered again you're going to
[24:30] remember it the devil's going to
[24:31] remember it but you're not going to
[24:32] remem i mean say god's not going to
[24:34] remember it
[24:35] thank god
[24:37] so with those who he has justified he's
[24:39] already glorified if he's justified you
[24:41] and you continue on
[24:44] continue on hold fast persevere hold
[24:48] fast means to grab on to and hold on
[24:50] hold fast not just old
[24:52] no hold fast brother brown i got a quote
[24:54] back there brother brown said put a
[24:56] death grip on it
[24:58] put a gas grip on it have you ever had
[25:00] put a death grip on that thing
[25:05] think of that
[25:08] well i
[25:09] i just don't know if
[25:11] i don't know if i make it or not
[25:14] that's a real death grip
[25:18] have you ever held something so dear in
[25:19] your life to where you did have a death
[25:21] grip on it
[25:24] i mean
[25:25] you're not getting this
[25:26] this is mine
[25:29] well that's what god told us to do
[25:30] didn't he hold fast
[25:32] persevere
[25:34] have faith
[25:36] and be born again sanctification we're
[25:38] talking about the soul now where the
[25:39] unclean spirit goes out and we'll read a
[25:42] quote here in just a minute and i put
[25:44] several together this afternoon where
[25:45] god listen
[25:47] god is not in your soul along with the
[25:50] devil
[25:51] can't happen
[25:54] everybody good with that
[25:57] you become two souls
[25:59] well i got this eternal seed where is it
[26:01] it's not in your soul
[26:04] where's this unclean spirit leaving from
[26:06] your soul
[26:09] so it will light it in your soul
[26:11] you either faith or doubt now is god
[26:14] doubt no no
[26:16] it's god faith
[26:18] one of the two not both
[26:22] in your soul today if you're not born
[26:24] again you're sold black is sacked
[26:27] and you're lost
[26:29] now listen you might be on your way you
[26:31] might be heading up the ladder you might
[26:33] be justified even coming to
[26:35] sanctification that unclean spirit is
[26:37] going to go out but listen like we're
[26:39] going to talk about in just a little
[26:40] while
[26:41] faith without works is dead
[26:44] faith
[26:46] without showing it
[26:48] you don't have faith
[26:51] let the thing loose
[26:53] as i said before
[26:56] one of these days
[26:58] you're gonna have to let it loose
[27:01] you're gonna prove who you are one way
[27:02] or the other
[27:06] now he said he'd give you a new spirit
[27:08] now that spirit isn't god's spirit now
[27:09] this is in sanctification that's your
[27:11] spirit
[27:12] god gives you a new spirit then he says
[27:14] i'll put my spirit in him but the thing
[27:16] god has to do is give you a new spirit
[27:18] make your nature a little more gentle
[27:20] and settle down or he can't even live
[27:22] with you
[27:23] so i put my faith in that god sanctified
[27:26] me did you
[27:27] have you put your faith in that god
[27:29] justified you forgave you of all your
[27:31] sins got rid of all that
[27:35] if you don't then you're doubting
[27:39] never with me
[27:42] is there any doubt in god
[27:45] no
[27:46] all right there's no doubt in god so
[27:48] you're either faith or doubt
[27:50] and if you've got the new birth what
[27:52] you've done is you've come through a
[27:54] process
[27:56] of believing
[27:58] he did justify me
[28:00] he did sanctify me got all that smoking
[28:02] drinking cussing just make your laundry
[28:04] list that's that's not at the new birth
[28:07] that's its sanctification
[28:09] because those unclean spirits can come
[28:11] back in because you know what the the
[28:13] hole's not filled up
[28:15] it can come back in and make you worse
[28:17] watch set you in the message church and
[28:18] oh i got my hair long and some of you i
[28:21] got my dresses not tight some of you
[28:27] preach i believe it will
[28:30] ain't never in my life see if y'all
[28:31] can't look over and look at your wives
[28:32] and look at your kids
[28:34] and see that they are living like the
[28:36] world and the dress is so tight you
[28:38] can't hardly pull them off of their body
[28:40] you need the new birth
[28:43] you need the new birth
[28:46] and you women you wives i'm telling
[28:47] every one of you next time i see
[28:50] skin hanging out where it shouldn't be
[28:52] like there's a top with a dress on and
[28:54] they don't meet
[28:55] me and you gonna have a talk
[28:57] but i'm going to your husband first
[28:59] i saw it too much last weekend
[29:02] i ain't saying no more all right baptism
[29:04] of the holy ghost that's that's the
[29:06] issue right there if you got the holy
[29:07] ghost you won't do that
[29:17] are we all right
[29:18] if i hurt your feelings then i'm talking
[29:20] about you
[29:22] so the baptism of the holy ghost is
[29:23] seeing you have what purified your soul
[29:25] in obeying what the truth
[29:28] not part truth the truth
[29:30] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[29:32] of the brethren see that you love one
[29:34] another with a pure heart what fervently
[29:38] why being born again
[29:43] you gotta have a change
[29:46] you gotta have a nature change because
[29:49] your nature is contrary to god you were
[29:51] born with a carnal mind you were born
[29:54] without god
[29:56] i said before please leave me alone
[30:00] in my revelation of redemption
[30:04] i was lost
[30:05] my whole being was lost i want the whole
[30:08] world to know this my whole being was
[30:10] lost
[30:11] i was doomed and on my way to hell
[30:14] but god by his rich and mercy grace he
[30:17] come one day and said hey
[30:20] let me in
[30:22] no the people in the message says no
[30:24] he's already in there you just want to
[30:25] let him out forgive me if i am going to
[30:28] shout a little bit more that is not the
[30:30] truth
[30:32] amen you're either born again you're not
[30:34] yes sir you either have faith in your
[30:36] soul or not
[30:39] being born why we got to do all this if
[30:41] we always was eternal i know we were in
[30:43] the mind of god i know we were always
[30:46] were eternal by the foreknowledge of god
[30:48] but that's god when we come down here we
[30:51] come down through a filter called sin
[30:54] and we can't give back without him
[30:56] coming
[30:57] we can't get back without him coming to
[30:59] get us
[31:00] that's redemption
[31:02] it's not a replacement
[31:05] i don't know where that come from but
[31:07] i'm going to charge you being born again
[31:08] not of corruptible seed i'm looking at
[31:11] corruptible seed
[31:13] i'm looking at what your mama and daddy
[31:14] produced
[31:16] and if you don't get born again and that
[31:18] will be in a grave and your soul is
[31:21] going to be in hell
[31:28] let me drive that home we can't go up
[31:30] this statue of a perfect man without
[31:31] being born again
[31:34] being born again not of corruptible seed
[31:36] but what incorruptible word of god
[31:41] not a little bitty baby seed that
[31:42] somewhere laying inside of you
[31:45] please
[31:47] oh then the quotas here they go well you
[31:49] was born with this
[31:51] you were born with a representation
[31:54] that you were going to come to it
[31:57] but when you was born from your mom and
[31:59] dad's womb you were lost
[32:00] if william branham said i was lost
[32:05] he said i used to wash my car on sunday
[32:08] before i was a christian this guy's a
[32:10] prophet
[32:12] i used to wash my car on sundays to make
[32:14] sure i didn't go to church and watch all
[32:16] them people go to church a prophet
[32:19] he was lost
[32:21] right
[32:25] but he screamed one day and said god
[32:26] forgive me when he was falling through
[32:29] hell when he was shot up all the
[32:31] you know they shot every how many times
[32:32] and his legs would blow it off he said
[32:34] god give me one more chance
[32:37] i want you to listen to me
[32:39] god's gonna give you one more chance
[32:43] if you don't take it you're gone
[32:49] but of incorruptible seed by what by the
[32:51] word of god you've got to hear the word
[32:54] which liveth in the bible forever
[32:56] listen take hold to that eternal life
[33:00] nothing else to do folks
[33:04] for whom he did for no he also did
[33:06] predestinate yes
[33:08] there is a group of people
[33:10] that is set aside
[33:12] given an angel at birth what to guide
[33:14] you through your life
[33:16] but you're gonna have to make a choice
[33:18] that angel can't make that choice for
[33:19] you
[33:20] that angel can't save you
[33:25] but he knew one day you'd come to it and
[33:27] say ah i'm done
[33:29] have you ever been there before
[33:31] if you have not
[33:33] alters open
[33:36] get to a place and say i'm done i'm
[33:37] finished i don't want to do this no more
[33:39] amen
[33:43] for whom he did foreign also did protest
[33:45] today what to be conformed to the image
[33:47] of his son that's why jesus came to die
[33:50] he died for the whole world but he only
[33:52] he knew in his infinite mind
[33:54] he knew who would and who wouldn't
[33:59] therefore he could place
[34:02] not a seed inside of you
[34:04] but a word inside of here
[34:07] amen everybody he put a word right he
[34:10] put a seed right here
[34:12] that one day a preacher preached and you
[34:13] responded you said that ain't nothing
[34:15] but the truth
[34:21] so that he might be the firstborn
[34:23] among many brethren moreover whom he did
[34:26] predestinate then he also called whom he
[34:28] called he justified who justified you
[34:30] also
[34:31] glorified romans 8 verse 11 says god has
[34:34] not cast away his people which he
[34:36] foreign there's no way he can
[34:38] like i said before if he loved you
[34:40] before the foundation of the world
[34:43] he still loves you now
[34:45] and he's going to love you for an
[34:46] eternity
[34:47] because he set aside a part of him agape
[34:50] love he set aside that part of that
[34:52] theophany
[34:55] everybody with me
[34:58] because he knew you would or he knew you
[35:00] wouldn't
[35:02] and even though he gave somebody like
[35:04] adolf hitler a million years to repent
[35:06] he knew
[35:06] adolf would never come to a place of
[35:08] repentance
[35:10] so therefore he could predestine his
[35:12] journey to be the cruel man that he was
[35:15] but he didn't make him be cruel
[35:18] to be a just god he can't make you do
[35:20] anything
[35:23] ephesians 1 says in dispensation of
[35:25] fullness of times that's right now
[35:27] this is our dispensation this is us he
[35:30] might gather together one all things in
[35:32] christ both which are in heaven which on
[35:34] earth
[35:35] even in him whom also
[35:37] we have obtained an inheritance why did
[35:39] we need to obtain it if we already had
[35:41] it
[35:43] i was lost
[35:44] i was out of the economy of god i was in
[35:47] another camp i was in another place
[35:51] but i had an inheritance
[35:54] being predestinated by his foreknowledge
[35:57] he saw where my inheritance was
[36:00] the will
[36:01] according to the purpose of him who
[36:02] works with all things what after the
[36:03] council of his own word or will that we
[36:06] should be to the praise
[36:09] what
[36:10] praise of his glory
[36:12] praise god
[36:16] if he'll hurry up i'll get me a nap
[36:19] most of you don't even wait
[36:21] that we should be the praise of his
[36:23] glory first trusting i'm sorry richard
[36:25] i'm doing it again
[36:27] and whom also you trusted look after
[36:32] i didn't trust god when i was a sinner
[36:35] did you
[36:38] tell us things i did i knew god was
[36:39] nowhere to be found
[36:41] oh yeah he was right there he was
[36:43] waiting on you but there's no way listen
[36:46] he won't dwell on an unclean vessel
[36:51] righteousness holiness that's god
[36:54] were you righteous and holy when you
[36:55] were out in the world i don't think you
[36:57] were
[36:58] so listen that makes my plan of
[36:59] redemption way much better
[37:02] is that i was gone
[37:03] i had no hope
[37:05] until he called my name
[37:07] is all right
[37:09] i'm sorry i didn't mean to go this way
[37:10] but this is the way we're going and whom
[37:12] you also trusted look after
[37:14] after you heard the word of truth
[37:17] the gospel of your salvation
[37:20] in whom also after that you believed you
[37:23] got to come to a place of believing
[37:26] what what does believing do with faith
[37:28] it puts them together
[37:31] faith and believing is together
[37:34] because when you have faith you believe
[37:36] in something
[37:37] all right it's right sister freddie you
[37:38] have faith you believe in something all
[37:40] right
[37:41] look which is the earnest of our
[37:42] inheritance see down to the church ages
[37:45] it still was an inheritance an earnest
[37:48] it was an inheritance they have eternal
[37:50] life in their soul but there was no way
[37:53] by the word they were given for each age
[37:56] or the faith they were given for each
[37:58] age for them to come to a body change
[38:00] because it had to come to malachi 4. it
[38:02] had to come to luke 17 30. it had to
[38:04] come to the end time that last prophet
[38:07] messenger had to come to draw people out
[38:10] to bring us back to the faith of the
[38:12] fathers
[38:13] so this we're not just looking brother
[38:15] bob we're not looking into earnest
[38:16] anymore
[38:18] this is full possession time
[38:22] until the redemption of the purchased
[38:23] possession of the praise
[38:25] of not our glory
[38:27] his glory
[38:29] acts 1 verse 4. he said unto them it is
[38:31] not for you to know the times of the
[38:32] seasons now this is jesus right before
[38:34] he left
[38:36] which the father has put in his own
[38:37] power but you shall receive power look
[38:39] at that word again after
[38:42] listen you have no power
[38:44] oh we think we got these great big i
[38:46] mean we you know we can do all this
[38:51] weakest people i know is the weakest
[38:52] people that that are unbelievers
[38:55] i don't care how big and strong you are
[38:57] you're an unbeliever you're an
[38:59] unbeliever
[39:00] it's for you know the time of season but
[39:02] you shall receive power after or dunamis
[39:05] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[39:06] you and you shall be witnesses unto me
[39:08] in jerusalem listen when they were
[39:10] walking around with jesus they were
[39:12] powerless oh yeah god you know jesus
[39:14] said all right i'm going to impart this
[39:16] go over here and heal the sick cast out
[39:18] devils but remember they couldn't do all
[39:19] that
[39:21] they come back say lord well this was a
[39:23] tough one
[39:25] i can't we can't do this
[39:28] he said all that takes uh
[39:30] more prayer and more fasting
[39:33] [Music]
[39:34] but he told him he said you shall
[39:36] receive power though
[39:38] after now
[39:39] now take and go over to the book of acts
[39:42] and take those same people
[39:44] interject paul in there take those same
[39:46] people peter james john all the
[39:48] different ones
[39:49] now
[39:50] they didn't need jesus listen to me they
[39:52] didn't need jesus be standing there
[39:55] they needed him to be standing there
[39:57] during his life everybody with me
[39:58] because the holy ghost was not given
[40:00] until jesus had been glorified or died
[40:02] and resurrected and came back on the day
[40:04] of pentecost right
[40:05] we know that no one had the holy ghost
[40:07] until
[40:08] the apostles in 120 in the upper room no
[40:11] one had the holy ghost in their soul
[40:13] what about john the baptist john the
[40:15] baptist had the holy ghost
[40:17] it was an anointing it was not in his
[40:19] soul
[40:20] because if it's in your soul you're born
[40:22] again you can't be born again until the
[40:23] testator dies
[40:25] everybody with me
[40:26] i believe john 5 says the holy ghost had
[40:28] not been given because jesus had not
[40:29] been glorified in other words he not he
[40:31] died he had to die to release that
[40:33] that's why they couldn't understand him
[40:35] but boy
[40:36] he said you shall receive power
[40:38] after the holy ghost so he ascends he
[40:40] comes back 11 days later and he goes
[40:42] into the people and they're like whoa
[40:44] [Music]
[40:46] peter said this is that
[40:49] he goes right back into scripture this
[40:50] is that
[40:53] and they received power
[40:55] unclean spirits were cast out they even
[40:57] walked past people in their shadow
[41:00] cast out demons
[41:02] cloths from paul they didn't have a
[41:04] problem casting out demons after jesus
[41:06] came back inside of them
[41:09] amen all right
[41:10] dunamis
[41:12] power and inherent power it's something
[41:14] you receive after that you're born again
[41:16] you haven't listen you're powerless
[41:18] until you have god in your life
[41:20] oh i've got a bank account you wouldn't
[41:22] believe yeah i believe it
[41:25] a few more turns of the sun you're going
[41:27] to go where is that thing
[41:34] in every age every age is the age of the
[41:36] holy ghost for the true believer
[41:38] i say in every age the evidence was the
[41:40] same
[41:41] those who had the spirit in other words
[41:43] got the new birth
[41:45] the teacher heard the word and that
[41:47] spirit of them what responded
[41:51] there ain't nothing but the truth
[41:54] and taught it and revealed it to them
[41:55] and they were of the group that heard
[41:57] the messenger and his message and took
[42:00] it and lived it
[42:03] followed me amen
[42:06] matthew 12 36 but i say unto you that
[42:08] every idle word
[42:10] wow that men shall speak they shall give
[42:12] an account thereof in the day of
[42:14] judgment
[42:15] for by thy words thou shalt be justified
[42:17] and by thy words thou shalt be
[42:20] condemned
[42:21] romans 10 verse 9 said if thou shalt
[42:23] confess with your mouth the lord jesus
[42:25] and believe in your heart
[42:27] not in this thing
[42:29] but your very soul the very core of you
[42:31] shall believe in thy heart that god has
[42:33] raised him from the dead thou shalt be
[42:35] saved
[42:36] for with the heart man believeth unto
[42:38] righteousness and with the mouth
[42:39] confession is made
[42:41] unto salvation now what is confessed to
[42:43] admit or declare one's self-guilt listen
[42:46] there's no confession if you don't have
[42:48] guilt
[42:50] you've got to have guilt
[42:52] to confess
[42:55] it's actually pretty simple
[42:57] of what one is accused of james 5 verse
[42:59] 16 says confess your faults
[43:01] one to another
[43:03] and pray one for another
[43:05] that ye may be healed
[43:07] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[43:08] righteous man our sister
[43:10] availeth much the word possess means
[43:13] what to acquire to get
[43:16] possess you your soul
[43:18] or procure a thing for oneself to
[43:21] possess to marry a wife
[43:23] let's continue on pretty quick i got to
[43:24] get down to number 13 and we're on
[43:26] number three first thessalonians 4 that
[43:29] every one of you should know how to
[43:31] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[43:33] honor now listen as we're going to talk
[43:35] about right here look
[43:37] that's your perfect man there's only two
[43:39] elements that controls the human being
[43:42] that's either doubt
[43:44] or faith one or the other you're
[43:46] possessed today you're either possessed
[43:48] of god or you're possessed of the devil
[43:51] but i'm so sweet that person's so sweet
[43:54] yeah the devil's pretty sweet sometimes
[43:56] you rile him up though
[43:58] you get in his face
[44:03] you'll find out
[44:06] but let's just be i mean why do we need
[44:08] a list here's one two
[44:11] either faith
[44:12] or doubt
[44:14] you don't come to church because you
[44:15] don't believe
[44:21] faith or doubt
[44:22] i'm going to tell you where faith final
[44:24] resting place is is right here
[44:28] brother bob and i were talking this
[44:29] morning i've been watching brother
[44:30] donnie reagan a couple of services
[44:32] because he's on a series i want to do
[44:34] later after this and brother bob said
[44:35] he's listening to
[44:37] to brother wayne lawson and they're
[44:38] everyone and i mean hammering on people
[44:40] coming to church
[44:42] because this is that final push
[44:44] if you don't come to church you're lost
[44:48] just say i'm lost i'm sorry i'm lost
[44:55] i'm sorry
[44:57] i and it ain't a rule to me
[45:00] me and you didn't get up this morning
[45:02] and and go well i
[45:05] where's that say it jim does it still
[45:07] say for satan not assembling let me see
[45:09] if i can find that
[45:10] well why in the world would you want to
[45:11] look for it it's been in there since
[45:12] they wrote it
[45:15] there's only two elements that control a
[45:17] human being that's either doubt or faith
[45:18] one or the other you're possessed of one
[45:21] that dominates your life
[45:24] just depends on how much faith you have
[45:27] is how high you can rise
[45:29] now you come to the altar realize you're
[45:31] a sinner whoa maybe we need to do that
[45:33] and you're sorry for your sins look you
[45:35] repent of what you've done and you can
[45:37] stay there and cry for a week in a week
[45:39] out
[45:40] and that will never save you until you
[45:42] believe that you are saved
[45:45] then you confess it yes amen
[45:48] now can't do nothing for you until you
[45:50] confess it
[45:52] he is the high priest of what you're
[45:53] feeling
[45:58] he's a high priest of your confession
[46:00] he can do nothing
[46:02] you confess me before men i'll confess
[46:04] you before the father is that right
[46:07] what you say i've done down here for you
[46:09] that's what i say the father that in
[46:11] other words he said what i do down here
[46:13] if you if you deny me here i'm going to
[46:14] deny you there and look you say well
[46:16] i've never denied god
[46:18] have you ever done wrong
[46:23] now here he is sitting here to make
[46:25] intercession on my confession
[46:30] have we tried that
[46:33] see these things during the week that i
[46:34] do that are not right
[46:36] as a human
[46:39] surprise
[46:43] i'm still human
[46:45] but when before i walk out when they
[46:47] start calling me out i go over there to
[46:48] that
[46:49] to that um mirror and i look myself in
[46:51] the face and i say god
[46:53] though if you want to throw me away
[46:55] that's fine give these people something
[46:57] use me move me out of the way you use me
[47:00] and get done what needs to be done if
[47:01] you want to throw me out of the building
[47:02] that's fine with me
[47:04] but help these people
[47:06] amen
[47:08] so i don't go over there to make sure my
[47:09] tire's straight
[47:11] i i do straighten my tire once in a
[47:12] while when it is crooked but i look at
[47:14] myself and i say this is this is me and
[47:16] this is me
[47:18] this is the man that has that has sinned
[47:20] during the week you know the little
[47:22] stuff understand me
[47:27] you ever do that when you walk through
[47:28] that door right there
[47:30] huh
[47:34] i mean how many of us bring bad spirits
[47:36] in here because your husband and wife or
[47:37] your kids have been
[47:38] yakking with each other coming up the
[47:39] road and
[47:40] and or even you're yacking with yourself
[47:44] that you've done something wrong or you
[47:45] said something crooked or wrong not
[47:47] crooked but you know off kilter
[47:50] and then you just keep walking wow
[47:51] everything's fine by the way he'll pray
[47:53] it out of me no i won't
[47:55] not unless you confess it
[48:00] renewing of your mind all right but
[48:02] without faith look without faith is
[48:04] impossible to please god for he that
[48:06] cometh to god must believe that what he
[48:08] is god
[48:09] and he's a rewarder
[48:12] there's the promises there's that joint
[48:13] heirs whatever promise you've got in
[48:16] that bible is yours
[48:18] you just got to take hold of them
[48:20] because you're what of them that
[48:22] diligently
[48:23] seek him
[48:25] perfect faith the prophet of god says
[48:27] look you can't be saved without faith
[48:29] faith is something that you have to
[48:31] believe is there like i said before you
[48:33] take your new birth out and show it to
[48:35] me
[48:36] no you i show it by my works
[48:39] i show it by what i do
[48:42] all right can't physically say all right
[48:44] this is my new birth
[48:46] but i have to believe that god's done it
[48:48] you have to believe it so much to you
[48:50] know what
[48:51] your faith unites with his
[48:54] and then it becomes your faith add to
[48:56] your faith
[48:57] this is my the prophet said god gave it
[49:00] to me
[49:01] when god gives you the new birth it's
[49:02] not his anymore it's yours
[49:06] but that's what he wanted to do give it
[49:07] to you
[49:10] and faith is something that you have to
[49:12] believe is there that really nothing
[49:14] else will declare us there but faith
[49:17] now i'm trying to bring faith to you so
[49:18] that you can be ready for a prayer line
[49:20] in the next few minutes now faith he
[49:22] that cometh to god must believe that he
[49:23] is
[49:24] now look it's impossible to please god
[49:26] without faith
[49:27] you can't please him
[49:29] why because you've got that old
[49:31] doubt unbelief
[49:33] god can't stand unbelief it's not you
[49:35] that don't he just don't like your own
[49:37] belief now i'm talking about even in the
[49:39] second realm in the spirit realm he
[49:40] doesn't like your unbelief in that realm
[49:42] either
[49:43] and that's why we're working up the
[49:44] statue of perfect man once we get
[49:46] started but then listen if that
[49:47] foundation is long i'm gonna preach long
[49:49] on faith
[49:50] because we gotta have faith and then be
[49:52] born again all right when we get up here
[49:54] a little bit the brother of kindness
[49:55] i'll say a few words and we'll go home
[49:58] love you brother as yourself
[50:00] that's enough
[50:01] love your enemies as yourself
[50:04] that's hard to do
[50:07] romans 12 should be not conformed to
[50:08] this world but be transformed by the
[50:10] renewing
[50:11] of your mind that you may prove what is
[50:13] that good and acceptable and perfect
[50:14] will of god that word there is a renewal
[50:18] now look it doesn't say
[50:21] complete demolition
[50:24] and rebuild
[50:26] everybody with me it doesn't say
[50:28] complete devastation
[50:30] as the earth is going to be destroyed as
[50:32] people believe except for us in the
[50:34] message know that it's just going to be
[50:35] what burnt over
[50:37] your old nature was burnt out it was
[50:39] burnt off of you
[50:40] kicked out
[50:42] god comes in and vulcanizes his soul to
[50:45] your soul
[50:46] somebody with me is that not redemption
[50:48] is that not that's the plan
[50:52] and i'm happy with it
[50:55] leave me alone
[50:56] but i needed a renovation as i said
[50:58] before our house needed a renovation the
[51:00] other day so brother gary comes and
[51:01] renovates our front porch and our back
[51:03] porch but you know what
[51:04] there was a big old trash can there
[51:07] and it was full of trash
[51:11] how about let's back in the dumpster
[51:12] house
[51:14] and get rid of the trash
[51:18] renovation complete change for the worse
[51:23] oh for the better yeah june loves her
[51:25] front porch brother gary she loves that
[51:27] front porch
[51:28] we haven't gotten to the back porch yet
[51:30] because she loves the front porch
[51:37] and i do too
[51:39] i like sitting there and looking out my
[51:41] porch without bugs
[51:42] jim's just so sweet that the bugs are
[51:44] all over her they don't bother me
[51:45] because i stink but they get on her and
[51:48] they get to biting her and now they
[51:49] don't do that so that's great
[51:51] but ain't that happy complete renovation
[51:54] you got something going on you've took
[51:56] the same house
[51:59] you've took the same house
[52:01] but you've renovated it
[52:03] a good coat a good coat of paint not on
[52:05] the outside hello somebody
[52:08] i've seen some of that here too some of
[52:09] that
[52:10] barn paint
[52:13] still it's the same barn
[52:18] like what
[52:19] bob said he saw a preacher online the
[52:21] other day that
[52:23] this is a denominational preacher wow
[52:25] and i think i'm going to do it if i can
[52:27] find some mannequins
[52:29] this preacher brings mannequins into his
[52:31] church and dresses them like the world
[52:34] and dresses this one's like christians
[52:39] world
[52:41] christians
[52:43] separated
[52:45] everybody with me
[52:47] world
[52:49] christians
[52:50] it shows you the difference we ought not
[52:52] have to but visual will help
[52:59] men look like men
[53:01] they don't wear pocket books and and
[53:06] necklaces and high heels and other junk
[53:08] that's the world
[53:10] that's what the world looks like
[53:13] we got to be separated even though the
[53:15] bible does tell us to dress different it
[53:17] does tell us to do different we should
[53:20] be different
[53:21] the world's going to be destroyed one
[53:23] day
[53:24] thank god he destroyed my world
[53:27] back in 1997
[53:29] and he renovated me and he's still
[53:31] working in all my rooms
[53:33] renovating
[53:37] why y'all make me holler for
[53:40] i'm getting old get a headache when i
[53:41] start hollering
[53:43] for i say that through grace given unto
[53:45] me to every man that's among you not to
[53:47] think himself more highly
[53:49] than he ought to think
[53:51] that's the key folks like i said before
[53:53] if you get a revelation it ought to
[53:55] humble you you get the new birth that
[53:56] ought to humble you
[53:59] we go up to statue a perfect man really
[54:02] going to humble us
[54:04] really going to get where we live it's
[54:06] going to get into them little inner
[54:08] rooms
[54:09] that we don't open
[54:11] except for ourself
[54:13] and we got our little secrets back there
[54:16] according god has dealt to every man the
[54:19] measure
[54:20] of faith now watch let's talk about
[54:22] measure and i want to read the scripture
[54:23] i interjected this this morning
[54:25] ephesians 3 verse 17
[54:27] i think aaron kind of preached on this
[54:29] several years ago maybe
[54:31] a while ago about the breadth and length
[54:33] and depth
[54:34] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[54:36] what faith
[54:38] you can't get away from faith
[54:40] it's in every scripture it's in all
[54:42] through the old testament it's all in
[54:44] the new testament
[54:46] and it should be all in this building
[54:47] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[54:50] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[54:52] in love all right rooted and grounded in
[54:54] love may be able to comprehend with all
[54:56] the saints what is the breadth
[54:58] and lengths and depths and heights
[55:02] and to know the love of christ which
[55:05] passes knowledge that you might be
[55:07] filled with all
[55:08] the fullness of god to me that's the
[55:10] statue of perfect man scripture
[55:13] length depth heights that's it
[55:17] that's not a flat that is a flat picture
[55:20] but pyramids are not flat
[55:23] it's got four sides on it
[55:28] our own nature is contrary to god i've
[55:30] been saying that since we started our
[55:32] own listen it's just contrary to god
[55:35] and i promise you it is an effort
[55:37] to get to come to church it is an effort
[55:40] to get up put on your good clothes
[55:43] your good right clothes

[55:50] have faith and be born again i'm getting
[55:52] off of that have faith and be born again
[55:53] look that's laying the foundation that's
[55:55] what we're going to talk about this
[55:56] afternoon we got to lay a foundation and
[55:58] i think we're trying now to get
[56:00] everybody to realize that if you're not
[56:03] on the foundation you can't go up the
[56:04] pyramid
[56:05] if you you can have a foundation of
[56:07] sinking sand or you can have a
[56:09] foundation of i believe i'll just try to
[56:11] make it on my own
[56:15] you know what you're going to do you're
[56:16] going to stand before the white throne
[56:18] judgment on your own
[56:20] and you're going to have to be judged
[56:21] the bible says by what by what you do by
[56:24] your works
[56:25] thank god
[56:27] he's covered
[56:28] mine confess
[56:33] beloved like when i give all diligence
[56:35] to right unto you i was reading what
[56:37] brother brown was talking about this
[56:38] scripture this is jude it was written 30
[56:41] years
[56:42] after
[56:43] the new birth on the day of pentecost
[56:45] this was written 30 years after that and
[56:47] look how far they've already
[56:49] 30 years after i'm talking about the
[56:51] holy ghost fail no denominational ideas
[56:54] yet i mean maybe some ideas but no
[56:55] churches
[56:56] no no no i see it at 3 25 a.d yet
[57:00] but in 30 years
[57:03] they've lost their faith
[57:06] beloved when i give all diligence to
[57:07] right under the common salvation it is
[57:10] need for me to write unto you and exhort
[57:11] you that you should earnestly contend
[57:14] for the faith which was lost
[57:17] which was once delivered unto the saints
[57:19] for their what there are certain men
[57:21] creep in unawares
[57:23] who are before of old ordained to this
[57:25] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[57:28] grace of god into lasciviousness and
[57:30] denying the only lord god in our lord
[57:32] jesus christ that is preachers
[57:36] i'm gonna read your scripture this
[57:37] afternoon because we're gonna hone on
[57:38] this a little bit where jesus stood
[57:40] there and he said look you've made my
[57:42] word
[57:44] of none of faith by your tradition
[57:47] that's what satan dilutes the word of
[57:49] god he's still doing it he's doing it in
[57:50] the message he's doing it in the world
[57:52] he's diluting it by saying oh it's okay
[57:55] he didn't really mean this
[57:57] like i said before you you can you can
[57:59] you can prove to me that brother adam
[58:01] was a false prophet
[58:04] but that bible tells you what to do
[58:07] you got to stand before that you don't
[58:09] have to stand before william branham you
[58:10] got to stand before that
[58:14] well he didn't there was 12 people or 16
[58:17] people fell off
[58:18] i don't care
[58:20] i do not listen if that bothers you
[58:24] get born again
[58:28] if that bothers you that you can't count
[58:30] 16 or 12 or ever how many he had a dream
[58:33] that so many fell off a bridge listen
[58:35] that was in the early 1900s there was no
[58:37] such thing as labor force and there was
[58:39] no such thing as ocean it was then
[58:42] people could have fell down in that
[58:43] concrete nobody ever known it look the
[58:44] guy just goes oops
[58:47] bring us another one
[58:49] why there was no record now you can't
[58:50] get by with it now
[58:52] you got cameras and you got ocean you
[58:54] got all the different things you know
[58:55] count your people so
[58:59] that does not shape me
[59:01] that does not shake you if you have
[59:03] faith if you have faith in the word of
[59:05] god that should not shake you at all
[59:07] but what if it doesn't matter he's took
[59:10] me to this
[59:12] he's taught me that
[59:14] he's taught me how to be a better
[59:15] christian
[59:16] all right lost faith faith of the
[59:18] fathers we talked about last sunday the
[59:20] book of acts was was the faith of the
[59:22] fathers
[59:23] everybody with me
[59:25] this was working in their life
[59:28] except for that
[59:30] everybody with me because the headstone
[59:32] was rejected
[59:34] that's the son of man he was rejected he
[59:37] went to glory he came back in the holy
[59:39] ghost to build a church
[59:41] well now as he was building the church
[59:44] satan gets in and says we need a pope
[59:48] we need a bishop
[59:49] we need to pray to dead saints
[59:52] uh i i you know we're going to tell you
[59:53] what jesus said father son holy ghost
[59:55] well i'm going to take that in acts 2 38
[59:57] which says the same thing
[59:59] you see what i mean
[1:00:00] satan has got in there pulled it start
[1:00:02] pulling it apart
[1:00:03] so it's a lost faith so that faith
[1:00:06] listen without even going starting up
[1:00:08] the pyramid brother brown had to
[1:00:10] listen let me
[1:00:11] hold on to your seat everybody grab your
[1:00:12] seat everybody grab it
[1:00:16] brother brown had to go up that pyramid
[1:00:19] okey-dokey then you can let go now i
[1:00:22] don't want anybody to walk out or fall
[1:00:23] over
[1:00:24] he had to go through that and he had to
[1:00:26] come to a position what did he say it's
[1:00:28] been 30 years
[1:00:30] to preach that one sermon of the stature
[1:00:33] of a perfect man
[1:00:35] to get it all together to get everything
[1:00:37] to get him where he was built up where
[1:00:39] he could he says in there and i'll read
[1:00:40] the quote later on when we get into the
[1:00:42] book he says lord build me up
[1:00:44] that i can teach others
[1:00:46] how to do this
[1:00:48] and you say it's not a requirement
[1:00:50] and you say it's not we don't need that
[1:00:54] if the prophet of god needed it i need
[1:00:56] it if the prophet of god needed it you
[1:00:58] needed it
[1:00:59] all right so now we gotta have faith for
[1:01:01] the time that's needed and that's what
[1:01:02] we said down to the church ages we know
[1:01:04] the woman that that was healed of the
[1:01:07] blood issue brother brown says the woman
[1:01:09] came with a perfect faith for that time
[1:01:11] because see she was wanting heal she
[1:01:12] didn't want it wasn't she wanted to get
[1:01:14] born again
[1:01:17] right it wasn't she wanted to go up the
[1:01:19] statue a perfect man
[1:01:21] it wasn't she wanted to be a woman
[1:01:23] preacher
[1:01:24] no she want to be healed so that's
[1:01:26] perfect faith for the time
[1:01:30] notice now
[1:01:31] perfect faith is a master of all
[1:01:33] circumstances
[1:01:34] perfect faith masters all
[1:01:37] circumstances no matter what it is it
[1:01:39] matters it's probably god's standing
[1:01:40] there little bitty man i mean like five
[1:01:43] foot four
[1:01:44] weigh a hundred pounds
[1:01:46] and here comes this guy six four
[1:01:49] brother mom said yeah he could have
[1:01:51] picked me up and killed me right there
[1:01:52] crushed me
[1:01:54] but he didn't even step backwards
[1:01:58] he said satan
[1:02:00] come out of that man and he said that
[1:02:02] man fell at my feet he said they had to
[1:02:04] move him off my feet well that wasn't he
[1:02:06] was doing this
[1:02:09] he was standing in his ground
[1:02:11] because he had faith for the time he he
[1:02:13] that faith mastered all circumstances
[1:02:16] same way with you and i you and i got to
[1:02:18] stand one day and not start stumbling
[1:02:20] backwards
[1:02:21] stand up
[1:02:23] no matter what it is it matters now just
[1:02:25] watch when you believe anything do
[1:02:27] anything and you've got faith in what
[1:02:29] you're doing
[1:02:31] no matter what the circumstances that
[1:02:33] don't have one thing to do with it
[1:02:35] it masters that circumstance if it's in
[1:02:38] a room of sickness and the lord revealed
[1:02:39] that this certain thing is going to
[1:02:40] happen you just speak it and go on now
[1:02:43] he didn't say i
[1:02:45] he said you
[1:02:47] you say to this mountain not the
[1:02:49] preacher not the priest
[1:02:51] you say to this mountain
[1:02:54] oh does the just don't ask any questions
[1:02:56] it's already over
[1:02:58] why do we try to explain stuff away
[1:03:01] we do we're humans we try to explain
[1:03:03] everything
[1:03:06] it's already over just keep going it
[1:03:08] masters all circumstances
[1:03:12] paul daniel what did they do they didn't
[1:03:13] have to explain nothing paul didn't have
[1:03:15] to give him a 30-minute sermon on why
[1:03:17] the serpent did
[1:03:19] he just slung the thing off went right
[1:03:21] back to picking up wood he was a servant
[1:03:23] he was trying to get firebill for what
[1:03:24] them 200 people that were wet
[1:03:26] thank god for a servant like that
[1:03:30] daniel the same way daniel didn't say
[1:03:32] well now the lines are no
[1:03:36] the lines just sit down beside of him
[1:03:40] daniel knew by his prophet that he was
[1:03:43] coming out of captivity in two years
[1:03:47] see that's the faith we gotta have for a
[1:03:49] body change
[1:03:51] just like daniel when they lowered him
[1:03:52] down in that it was hey look from from
[1:03:55] from a from a uh
[1:03:57] television commentary
[1:04:00] well we're here today
[1:04:01] and daniel must have done something
[1:04:03] wrong
[1:04:04] because daniel is now oh look folks
[1:04:07] they're lowering him down into the oh
[1:04:09] listen to the lines
[1:04:11] you said what i'm talking about like
[1:04:12] today dramatize it all but they not they
[1:04:15] didn't see what happened because you
[1:04:16] know what a few days later they had to
[1:04:18] go back again and say well folks we're
[1:04:20] going to see bones today
[1:04:23] no they saw a man sat down there rubbing
[1:04:25] two cats
[1:04:27] remember how many it was why because
[1:04:29] faith master daniel said i can't die
[1:04:32] david says i cannot die until i sit on
[1:04:34] the throne go out doesn't matter cancer
[1:04:37] heartache troubles trials can't happen
[1:04:39] until i sit where that promise told me i
[1:04:42] was going to sit amen you take a promise
[1:04:45] and say i'm going to sit right here
[1:04:52] have faith for divine healing
[1:04:55] we pray for people
[1:04:56] it may be a week it may be a month it
[1:04:58] may take a doctor
[1:05:00] it may take an operation
[1:05:02] but you just have faith
[1:05:04] you just believe
[1:05:06] it's like dad's always said he said if i
[1:05:08] pass away he said don't put on my
[1:05:09] headstone i'm dead
[1:05:11] or that i didn't believe
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:16] because you know what the people of the
[1:05:17] dark ages they died believing
[1:05:21] that that was the spirit of their age
[1:05:24] and that they come under that messenger
[1:05:25] they had and they died for it
[1:05:29] you and i
[1:05:30] but we got to have raptured faith we'll
[1:05:32] get to that a little bit later
[1:05:33] watch this right here god's commission
[1:05:36] this is 1953. we'll stop right here
[1:05:39] it didn't get to number 13 we'll get to
[1:05:41] it this afternoon
[1:05:44] brother brown says i have a great faith
[1:05:46] to believe that one day before the
[1:05:48] coming of the lord
[1:05:50] that all our little differences will be
[1:05:52] settled
[1:05:55] does the word of god have differences
[1:05:58] so i guess it must be that we can get
[1:06:00] back to the 100 word of god
[1:06:02] not man's ideas all right
[1:06:04] god may have to let communism
[1:06:07] looks like it now doesn't it
[1:06:09] communism sweep us together but
[1:06:11] something will take place that'll make
[1:06:13] us all
[1:06:14] one heart
[1:06:16] and in one accord
[1:06:18] if we can't have faith now for healing
[1:06:20] how are we going to have rapturing faith
[1:06:23] we've got to have faith for the little
[1:06:25] things first before
[1:06:28] the great things
[1:06:29] so there'll be something that'll cause
[1:06:31] that's in god's providence i do not know
[1:06:34] now i believe he knew later on
[1:06:37] i seen a demonstration of it recently
[1:06:40] because look at the look at the title of
[1:06:42] that sermon
[1:06:43] god commissioning moses and he was
[1:06:45] getting ready to tell the people his new
[1:06:47] commission instead of taking him by the
[1:06:49] hand he was going to tell them the
[1:06:50] secrets of their heart
[1:06:51] all right so he saw that i want
[1:06:54] a demonstration and that's what i want
[1:06:55] to tell you about
[1:06:56] james 1 verse 2
[1:06:59] and i'm going to ask you this question
[1:07:00] and then we musicians go ahead and come
[1:07:02] my brother encountered all joy oh
[1:07:07] count it all joy
[1:07:11] when you fall into diverse temptations
[1:07:13] many temptations
[1:07:15] everybody still believe the bible is
[1:07:16] right all right amen the bible's right
[1:07:18] okay my brethren counted all joy
[1:07:21] when you fall into this is the same
[1:07:23] james that's writing about this faith
[1:07:26] that works
[1:07:27] this is the same james is talking about
[1:07:29] all these other things that we're going
[1:07:30] to talk about tonight or this afternoon
[1:07:32] my brother encountered all joy when you
[1:07:34] fall into many temptations
[1:07:36] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:07:39] faith now it's yours it's not god's it's
[1:07:42] yours the trying of your faith worketh
[1:07:45] patience but let patience have her
[1:07:48] perfect work that you may be what
[1:07:50] perfect and entire wanting
[1:07:54] nothing there's a question for you right
[1:07:57] there
[1:07:58] put your faith
[1:08:00] in what
[1:08:02] musicians come let's stand to our feet
[1:08:07] right here we'll read this and we'll
[1:08:08] start right here or we'll start back
[1:08:09] again
[1:08:10] faith takes its final resting place
[1:08:13] on the word of god
[1:08:15] that's where it finds its resting place
[1:08:17] you understand its resting place is on
[1:08:21] god's word that's where noah rested
[1:08:24] god said so
[1:08:26] that settles them
[1:08:28] that settles it
[1:08:31] so put your faith in the word of god
[1:08:32] please don't put your faith in a man
[1:08:34] don't put your faith in anything but the
[1:08:35] word of god don't put your faith in the
[1:08:37] church
[1:08:38] put your faith in the word of god all
[1:08:40] right we want to have faith in god
[1:08:42] because you know what but now see we
[1:08:44] have a church we have an organism here
[1:08:45] we have don't have an organization we
[1:08:47] have an organism we have piano players
[1:08:48] we have all these great musicians we
[1:08:50] have wonderful ministers and now we got
[1:08:53] an extra uh sunday school teacher and
[1:08:55] all these different things that's an
[1:08:57] organism that's the way we work and we
[1:08:58] saw that last weekend we saw that work
[1:09:01] but why did we do it did we do it
[1:09:03] because of
[1:09:05] brother joe
[1:09:07] just for an example he wasn't even there
[1:09:10] but did we did we do it just no
[1:09:13] we did it because we've been taught well
[1:09:18] by the word of god
[1:09:21] we've been taught well by the word of
[1:09:23] god
[1:09:24] take all the names out but we've been
[1:09:26] taught well by the word of god we can
[1:09:27] step in and do we can back up we can
[1:09:30] help this one over here we can back up
[1:09:32] all those different things are done
[1:09:33] because what's inside of you
[1:09:35] so your works
[1:09:37] expressed your faith
[1:09:40] we had faith in what we were doing last
[1:09:41] weekend
[1:09:42] we had faith for what we were doing
[1:09:44] today we had faith to get up and come to
[1:09:45] work come to church and come to work
[1:09:47] and do the things that we need to do
[1:09:49] here we come here to worship god and
[1:09:51] like i said before listen come here to
[1:09:53] learn don't come here to see so-and-so
[1:09:55] or or just cause brother wade told you
[1:09:56] to i i hope you don't do that but come
[1:09:59] here because you want to learn something
[1:10:00] from god and you don't want to just come
[1:10:01] and say well it's this sunday and then
[1:10:03] uh we got three more sundays and then
[1:10:06] it's next month and maybe we'll have
[1:10:07] somebody new that'll come in and preach
[1:10:09] better to us
[1:10:10] or something like that
[1:10:12] no
[1:10:13] hear from god
[1:10:21] how many of y'all stayed in
[1:10:22] kindergarten
[1:10:27] nobody
[1:10:29] moved to the first grade
[1:10:32] from the first grade to the second grade
[1:10:34] and we learned
[1:10:36] every year
[1:10:38] a little more
[1:10:39] then some of us went to college
[1:10:41] and boy we really learned stuff then a
[1:10:44] lot of bad stuff but we did learn some
[1:10:46] stuff
[1:10:47] and then like you know anna back there
[1:10:49] she's almost a she's almost dr roberts
[1:10:53] you get a degree
[1:10:55] i want a degree in the statue of a
[1:10:57] perfect man
[1:10:58] that's what i want to degree in because
[1:11:00] you know what we'll not have christ come
[1:11:02] back as the son of man until we do that
[1:11:04] right there until the body
[1:11:06] is fit together
[1:11:08] so the body is working as an organism
[1:11:12] so everything's working as a unit
[1:11:14] together brotherly love with charity
[1:11:17] godliness patience temperance and then
[1:11:19] what then brother brown said we'll read
[1:11:21] it
[1:11:22] several months from now he comes and
[1:11:24] caps it off that's what we want to do we
[1:11:26] want him to come and cap it off we want
[1:11:28] him to come and cap us off
[1:11:30] individually now not as a whole he comes
[1:11:32] as an individual
[1:11:34] i want him to sit down and seal that
[1:11:36] thing in and we're walking breathing
