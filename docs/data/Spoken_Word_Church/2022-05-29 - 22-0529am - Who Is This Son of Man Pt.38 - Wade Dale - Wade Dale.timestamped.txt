[10:27] amen god bless you proud to know you man
[10:30] prayer to know you both amen
[10:34] all right let's read the scripture we're
[10:36] going to preach here in just a minute
[10:39] let's go to john 1 1. like i said we're
[10:41] on part 38 of who is this
[10:43] son of man
[10:45] we know that
[10:47] we know who that is and
[10:50] it's god made flesh
[10:52] but it wasn't god made flesh just 2000
[10:54] years ago it wasn't god made flesh 60
[10:56] years ago in the prophet it was god made
[10:58] flesh in you
[10:59] and the word was made flesh
[11:01] so let's go to john 1 verse 1. in the
[11:03] beginning was the word
[11:05] the word was with god
[11:06] the word was god
[11:08] and what happened
[11:09] the word was made flesh
[11:12] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[11:13] glory the glory of the only begotten of
[11:14] the father
[11:15] full of grace
[11:17] and truth let's bow our heads dear lord
[11:18] thank you for this day
[11:20] we appreciate the time we have lord
[11:23] with this group of people
[11:25] lord i pray that you bind us together
[11:27] closer to you lord his brother aaron was
[11:29] talking about bitterness on wednesday
[11:30] night lord don't ever let that root of
[11:32] bitterness come in lord
[11:34] cut that thing off lord as we bind
[11:36] closer and closer together that we as we
[11:38] see the union of
[11:40] of sister lily and brother zach lord
[11:43] we pray that they'll bind closer
[11:45] together
[11:46] each one of us too is husband and wife
[11:47] and parents and all we should bind
[11:49] together lord
[11:51] to defeat this devil as i've always said
[11:53] i want the devil to be uncomfortable in
[11:55] this place and the holy ghost to be so
[11:57] comfortable that he just breaks out into
[11:59] shouting and screaming lord
[12:01] praise god for that
[12:02] we have an opportunity today lord to
[12:04] hear from you now father i pray that you
[12:06] would do the speaking
[12:08] that they would do the hearing lord and
[12:09] as you would give the revelation
[12:11] we give this all to you lord in the name
[12:13] of the lord jesus christ
[12:15] amen you can be seated
[12:17] so we get started a little bit the
[12:18] background some will go to romans 10
[12:20] verse 8.
[12:22] i want to read a little quote you know
[12:23] they send the quote of the day
[12:26] uh from the voice of god
[12:28] but i like this one
[12:30] this is from the intervale they don't
[12:31] have it so i'm just going to read it to
[12:32] you but brother adam says look
[12:36] i may not be a good preacher
[12:39] but i know what i'm talking about
[12:42] he said friends i know that a man
[12:44] without a new birth is alien from god
[12:48] amen he knows not of god
[12:51] i know you've got to accept that
[12:53] experience if you're ever going to
[12:55] heaven
[12:56] wow
[12:57] if he doesn't have that experience he
[12:59] will in no wise enter the kingdom
[13:02] the prophet of god said no matter how
[13:03] good you've been how well you treat your
[13:05] neighbor how well you went to church
[13:07] how you supported it that's all good
[13:11] that has nothing to do with it
[13:14] except a man be born again listen to
[13:16] this
[13:17] a mysterious birth
[13:20] that sends you out yonder into a spear
[13:24] now he just told us that we were if we
[13:26] were not born again we were aliens to
[13:28] god
[13:29] but now once you get born again he's
[13:31] fixing to tell you you're going to be an
[13:32] alien
[13:35] everybody believe brother brown was a
[13:37] prophet
[13:38] i just want to make sure we got the
[13:39] right crowd here today
[13:40] a mysterious birth that sends you out
[13:43] yonder into a spear that you know
[13:46] nothing of
[13:48] when you're an alien though you go to
[13:50] church and try to do right still that
[13:52] isn't in it friend
[13:54] are you born again these ques the
[13:55] question is are you born again
[13:57] washed in the blood of the lamb
[14:00] you will become an alien you'll become
[14:02] an alien to this world
[14:04] all you that were baptized sunday
[14:08] something was planted
[14:10] now let's see it grow
[14:12] amen
[14:13] let's see it
[14:15] in your works
[14:17] let's see it you say oh brother wait
[14:18] it's not words no
[14:20] it is after you get born again
[14:23] you got something to do
[14:25] as we've been talking about the son of
[14:27] man he didn't just become a baby and
[14:29] then he went and died at calvary he had
[14:31] a journey
[14:32] he lived through life just like me and
[14:35] you
[14:36] god in human flesh well what are we
[14:38] today about the baptism of the holy
[14:39] ghost you and i are god in human flesh
[14:42] amen
[14:43] but a mysterious birth the world don't
[14:45] understand when you say born again
[14:47] there's like nicodemus they say why how
[14:49] in the world am i gonna have to go back
[14:50] into my mother's womb and be born again
[14:54] jesus said nope gotta be born from above
[14:57] so those of you that were baptized
[14:58] you're on a good start
[15:00] seek the baptism of the holy ghost if
[15:02] you don't have it
[15:03] pray to god that you grow
[15:06] and you know what a plant is supposed to
[15:08] do
[15:09] is supposed to produce fruit
[15:12] i planted a garden the other day and
[15:13] i've got corn up about this high
[15:17] i want some fruit off of that well
[15:19] what's gonna happen i'm gonna have to
[15:20] give it some water i'm gonna have to get
[15:21] a little bit of fertilizer and i'm gonna
[15:23] have to cultivate it a little bit so
[15:25] once we do that and god sends the rain
[15:27] and we give the nutrients to it guess
[15:28] what about the end of july 1st of august
[15:32] i'm going to have some air corn and
[15:33] we're going to be able to eat that so
[15:34] that's what i want with god i want us to
[15:36] be where we can eat that fruit
[15:38] everybody can enjoy the fruit
[15:40] and everybody can enjoy
[15:43] the presence of god
[15:45] we want we should long for the presence
[15:47] of god more than anything we love each
[15:49] other but we love the presence of god
[15:52] and the quietness
[15:53] of the prayer time and the quietness of
[15:55] reading your bible and the quietness in
[15:56] the morning
[15:57] i told we were talking about something
[15:59] yesterday and where were we at we were
[16:01] always working
[16:03] josh's in-laws
[16:05] i said the best cup of coffee is a quiet
[16:07] cup of coffee
[16:10] hey man
[16:11] the best cup of coffee it's a quiet cup
[16:13] of coffee
[16:14] you get quiet in the morning you get
[16:15] that cup of coffee and that's the most
[16:17] important cup of coffee because you're
[16:18] talking to god or you're reading your
[16:20] bible or something's going on that's
[16:22] quiet coffee is what i like now it's
[16:24] time to be shouting over sprite and diet
[16:26] coke and all whatever ginger ale
[16:28] whatever you want to drink but i want
[16:29] that quiet coffee in the morning
[16:32] so that we can talk to god
[16:34] romans 10 verse 8 says but what saith it
[16:37] the word is nigh thee even thy mouth and
[16:39] in thy heart that is the word of faith
[16:40] which we preach
[16:42] that if you should confess with your
[16:43] mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe
[16:45] in thy heart that god hath raised him
[16:46] from the dead thou shalt be saved for
[16:49] when the heart man believeth unto
[16:50] righteousness and with the mouth
[16:52] confession is made
[16:53] unto salvation we've been talking like i
[16:55] said

[17:24] him over he's got a thing right here and
[17:26] it's four-sided
[17:28] an hour for each side

[17:38] i'm scaring them
[17:40] i don't want to scare the people but
[17:42] they don't have a second service we do
[17:43] so we kind of timely we got to stop and
[17:45] start over again so
[17:46] but brother stevens i've never met the
[17:48] brother but he's a good teacher he's a
[17:51] good teacher if you want to
[17:53] ever watch him online stephen chambers
[17:55] spoke about tabernacle right
[17:56] tabernacle yeah okay almost like spoken
[18:00] word church
[18:02] but we've been doing this for 50 years
[18:03] so we
[18:05] we got dibs on the
[18:07] we own the domain
[18:11] you can't ever be a spoken word church
[18:13] part two
[18:17] but we know that we've been we
[18:19] we have fun down here brother john
[18:22] but we know that we're predestinated to
[18:23] adoption we're not just predestined to
[18:25] get born again that's what we've been
[18:26] trying to stay down at the bottom of the
[18:28] pyramid
[18:30] but we got to go somewhere we've got a
[18:32] job we've got to as brother bob was
[18:35] talking about we've got to come under
[18:36] this son of man revelation
[18:38] and we know that brother branham will
[18:41] read the well we're not gonna read the
[18:42] quote i took it out but you ought to
[18:43] know that brother brown said your your
[18:45] birth is not your adoption two different
[18:47] things
[18:48] amen
[18:49] you can't be adopted without being born
[18:52] again but you can be born again and not
[18:53] be adopted because we're going to talk
[18:55] about this afternoon we're going to
[18:57] bring some quotes where brother brown
[18:58] talks about doors and doors where even
[19:00] when god comes into your house there's
[19:02] still doors there
[19:03] and that's what that's what these
[19:05] virtues are for you say well i don't god
[19:07] i don't want you behind that door and
[19:09] many times brother john i told him i
[19:10] said if i was the holy ghost i'd be
[19:12] knocking it down
[19:13] but brother brown said god
[19:15] the holy ghost was a timid god
[19:18] if you don't let him in he ain't gonna
[19:19] knock the door he's standing at the door
[19:21] knocking
[19:22] me and you we would have the battle axe
[19:24] and we would have we'd have the we'd
[19:26] have everything we needed to knock that
[19:28] door down and find out what's going on
[19:29] but remember patience
[19:31] we're going to talk about those virtues
[19:33] if we ever get to it but it's not your
[19:35] birth so let's look at the first chart
[19:37] if y'all want to bring the the one up
[19:39] that we um
[19:40] that we've been using
[19:43] but we know that adoption is in three
[19:45] stages brother dale's preaching on this
[19:46] many many many times so we're just kind
[19:48] of
[19:49] um
[19:50] redoing it again and and and preaching
[19:53] it lord in our
[19:54] in our revelation which is exactly like
[19:57] his not that one
[19:59] the first one i'm sorry i told him to
[20:01] get that one but we're going to talk
[20:02] about that one in a minute but bring the
[20:04] first one up that's the statue of a
[20:05] perfect man that has the uh
[20:07] justification sanctification the baptism
[20:09] in the holy ghost i'm sorry brothers
[20:10] that's my fault but in this three stages
[20:12] of adoption what's the first stage
[20:14] you've got to be born again you've got
[20:16] to get into the family of god
[20:18] amen israel was in the family of god
[20:22] before their journey
[20:24] they were born the fam they were born
[20:26] the family of god they they were israel
[20:29] they were god's chosen people
[20:31] so
[20:32] they were not in their wilderness
[20:34] journey they didn't become jews
[20:37] they didn't become israel they were the
[20:38] children of israel amen before their
[20:41] journey they were the children of israel
[20:43] so but
[20:44] we believe
[20:46] as brother brown did in dispensations
[20:50] we believe in god in stepping stepping
[20:52] stones they'll find it a man that's cute
[20:55] they'll find it in a minute
[20:59] we say pretty
[21:02] but as many as led by the spirit of god
[21:04] they are the sons of god so now we're
[21:06] going to start at the new birth and when
[21:07] they find that other picture they get it
[21:09] up there for me in just a minute for ye
[21:11] have not received the spirit of bondage
[21:12] again to fear but you have received the
[21:14] spirit of adoption the spirit of
[21:15] adoption not adoption
[21:18] the spirit of adoption where you cry
[21:20] daddy daddy i'm in my crying stage i'm
[21:23] still in diapers but you know even
[21:26] even when you're born natural birth
[21:28] you're born
[21:30] what
[21:31] body spirit and soul
[21:34] amen
[21:36] but can you drive a car
[21:38] just as soon as you're born no way
[21:40] but you have every faculty your hands
[21:42] you've got you don't grow eyes you don't
[21:44] grow toes you don't grow feet you've got
[21:46] all that so brother brown tells us at
[21:48] the new birth you get everything you
[21:50] need for your journey all right well now
[21:53] you can either put it on a shelf and
[21:54] leave it there and let it rot
[22:07] there we go
[22:08] so that's the chart we've been using
[22:11] and
[22:12] i believe brother bob did that and we
[22:14] kind of just tweaked it a little bit but
[22:16] you don't get into the body of christ
[22:17] until you get to the new birth there is
[22:19] no way you can get the virtue of god
[22:22] without having the new birth now you can
[22:25] have natural virtue you can have natural
[22:27] knowledge natural
[22:29] listen satan's got natural knowledge
[22:32] the devil himself has got so much
[22:35] knowledge i'll read it to you in just a
[22:36] minute judas
[22:39] was in
[22:40] the ministry
[22:42] of jesus christ
[22:44] wow
[22:46] brother brown said he was justified and
[22:47] sanctified
[22:49] wow the devil himself
[22:51] anointed ones his brother bob was
[22:53] talking about the anointed ones that
[22:55] it's like we're going to read the quote
[22:57] later on this this afternoon that
[22:59] without these virtues you're a stumbling
[23:03] block
[23:04] to the believer because what you're
[23:06] doing is
[23:06] everybody wants to jump all the way up
[23:08] here and say well we're in this right
[23:09] here
[23:10] not yet you're not you're in the layout
[23:12] of seeing church age but you're not
[23:14] at brotherly kindness as soon as you get
[23:16] born again i'll promise you that
[23:18] amen and you should know that through
[23:20] your journey you should know where
[23:22] you're at
[23:23] at any time as what the prophet of god
[23:25] said but we're going to talk today about
[23:26] what we call brother john is baby form
[23:28] justification because baby form
[23:30] justification is you get your your sins
[23:32] chopped off but you still
[23:34] sin you're still sin you're still a
[23:37] sinner you're not even the body of
[23:39] christ even in sanctification that's
[23:41] what we've been talking about everybody
[23:42] says well how do you know you're born
[23:43] again i know brother bob covered it this
[23:46] morning but how you know you're born
[23:47] again well i quit drinking i quit
[23:49] smoking i quit gambling
[23:52] i started going to church
[23:53] that's and i started believing the
[23:55] message oh you can't you gotta leave
[23:56] that you can't leave that one out
[23:59] listen the devil comes to church more
[24:01] than y'all do
[24:06] he believes the message part of it
[24:09] and he believes part of the word
[24:12] because he wants to be like god he wants
[24:14] to have his own word
[24:16] right so close that's what it is it's so
[24:19] close we'll deceive the very lack if it
[24:20] were possible but if you ever get bored
[24:23] again and sealed in you can't stay
[24:25] deceived you might be deceived but you
[24:26] can't stay deceived amen
[24:29] but you've received the spirit of
[24:30] adoption whereby you cry
[24:32] daddy daddy or father father the spirit
[24:35] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[24:37] that we are the children of god you're
[24:39] not the children of god because you quit
[24:41] drinking smoking cussing and what i call
[24:43] is a laundry list
[24:45] do's and don'ts that's right
[24:48] that just means you're a good person or
[24:50] you've you've
[24:51] you know you've alcohol it's anonymous
[24:53] or whatever you want to call it you know
[24:54] i just quit i you know i quit doing
[24:56] things sometimes when i was a center i'd
[24:57] quit doing stuff
[24:59] did that mean i was born again no
[25:01] no i didn't care anything about god i'm
[25:03] sorry i didn't
[25:05] oh you all did
[25:07] oh okay
[25:10] still believe brother brown was a
[25:11] prophet right believe his teaching well
[25:14] i guess some of you do know some of you
[25:15] didn't raise your hand
[25:16] there's another church right over there
[25:18] if you need to go
[25:20] but justification baby form
[25:22] justification is you get your
[25:24] sins chopped off it's put in the sea of
[25:26] god's forgetfulness never to be
[25:28] remembered again and you are on your way
[25:31] to the kingdom
[25:33] amen because it it is a work of the holy
[25:35] ghost but you and i can get off that
[25:37] train anytime we want to
[25:39] because you're a free moral agent oh no
[25:41] i got this hello
[25:43] we'll get to that in a little bit
[25:47] so justification chops off your past
[25:48] says god puts it in the sea of
[25:50] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[25:52] again but you and i still remember and
[25:54] you and i still have that as brother
[25:55] brown calls his brother
[25:57] aaron will talk about that root of
[25:58] bitterness is still there
[25:59] you still have a soul that is black
[26:02] everybody with me
[26:05] but now when we become the children of
[26:06] god
[26:08] we become heirs and join errors so we
[26:09] get whatever christ gets that's what we
[26:11] get
[26:12] only if you're born again
[26:14] only you have may have went through
[26:16] justification sanctification in the
[26:17] baptism of the holy ghost so let's go to
[26:19] justification what we're talking about
[26:20] here it says look but what saith that
[26:22] the word is nigh the even thy mouth
[26:24] and in the heart that is the word of
[26:26] faith which we preach that's what we're
[26:28] talking about just a second ago that if
[26:29] you shall confess with your mouth
[26:31] the lord jesus and believe in thy heart
[26:33] that god hath raised him from the dead
[26:35] thou shalt be saved for with the heart
[26:38] man believeth unto righteousness god
[26:40] knows if you're
[26:41] sorry for what you did
[26:44] you know you've heard the old phrase you
[26:46] find jesus in jail
[26:48] you believe in jesus because you got
[26:49] caught
[26:51] yeah that ain't justification
[26:53] no you're trying to justify yourself
[26:56] i want the justifier the one that don't
[26:58] have it to begin with i want him to
[27:00] clean start cleaning me up i want him to
[27:02] justify me i don't want to justify
[27:04] myself a lot of problem is we justify
[27:06] ourselves
[27:07] for when the heart believeth under
[27:08] righteousness and with the mouth
[27:10] confession is made
[27:11] unto salvation
[27:13] that's what you do when you first start
[27:14] as we were talking about
[27:16] last week in the baptismal service a lot
[27:18] of people just get baptized because
[27:19] their buddy gets baptized or they feel
[27:21] like they need to get baptized again
[27:24] but peter said repent
[27:28] repent and be baptized that's our
[27:30] problem we miss that step of
[27:32] justification repent and then go to the
[27:35] water and then let us kill you we're
[27:37] going to a funeral today right
[27:39] somebody is going to die if you'll let
[27:41] it
[27:42] the old you is going to pass away behold
[27:45] all things are going to become new or
[27:46] the bible tells us in romans in newness
[27:48] of life so we're going to come up in
[27:50] newness of life and leave that old
[27:53] stuff
[27:54] in that water amen
[27:57] romans 3 verse 24 is being justified
[27:59] freely
[28:00] by his grace through the redemption that
[28:02] is in christ jesus
[28:03] listen baby form justification is
[28:05] absolutely a part of your redemption
[28:08] because you got to get your sins chopped
[28:10] off you got to get give god something to
[28:12] start working on
[28:14] amen whom god has sent forth to be a
[28:16] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[28:18] to declare his righteousness look
[28:21] and i believe this is where brother
[28:22] branham i know he got a he's a prophet
[28:25] and he got revelation but where did he
[28:26] get it from he got it from the bible
[28:28] he got him from the bible brother brown
[28:30] says you get your past sins chopped off
[28:33] i've heard preachers pray in this
[28:35] message lord forgive me for my future
[28:37] sins
[28:40] that's a bunch of bull
[28:42] that's catholicism
[28:45] it says right here righteousness for the
[28:47] remission of sins that are
[28:50] past
[28:52] you got to do it first
[28:54] through the forbearance thank the lord
[28:56] of god
[28:57] to declare i say at this time
[29:00] his righteousness not yours
[29:02] that he might be just and the justifier
[29:05] of him which believeth in jesus
[29:07] where is boasting then it is excluded
[29:09] by what love works nay but by the law of
[29:12] faith
[29:14] therefore we conclude i like paul paul
[29:17] brings you something he'll bring you
[29:19] scripture and he'll bring you a whole
[29:20] chapter
[29:21] and then all of a sudden he'll say
[29:23] in conclusion
[29:25] this is what i was talking about
[29:27] therefore we conclude that a man is
[29:29] justified by faith without the deeds of
[29:32] the law
[29:35] god forgive me
[29:37] but now remember the next justification
[29:39] when we get into the body of christ we
[29:40] don't throw justification away we have
[29:42] to continue on with that justification
[29:45] god forgive me of my sins i ask him
[29:47] every day to forgive me of my sins
[29:49] christians are the only ones that have
[29:51] sins
[29:52] if we'd realized we were sinners first
[29:56] and that we still have sins
[29:59] in our second realm
[30:03] if you're born again you don't sin in
[30:04] your soul you know that
[30:06] but we've got memory reason conscious
[30:08] effects and imagination that we have to
[30:09] deal with
[30:10] memory is what kills me
[30:13] my reasoning my consciousness of this
[30:15] world
[30:16] my imagination god don't imagine
[30:19] so where's that come from that comes
[30:21] from the devil
[30:22] god doesn't imagine when god thinks it
[30:24] happens
[30:25] he don't imagine something happening
[30:27] he's already seen it happen
[30:29] so that's what we've got to get to
[30:31] we've got to get to that faith it's the
[30:33] substance of things hoped for the
[30:34] evidence of things what not seen
[30:36] not sick have you did you see jesus get
[30:38] crucified
[30:40] did you see him resurrect
[30:41] but i sure believe it
[30:43] and i sure know that's that one that did
[30:45] it's inside of me
[30:46] that way i know that i can really
[30:48] believe it not just that he did it 2000
[30:50] years ago but he's still doing it now
[30:54] so now let's go to sanctification
[30:57] see this is where that
[30:59] sometimes without good teaching
[31:02] it's what i said before
[31:04] brother dale when he first came in the
[31:05] message in 1968 what'd they ask him he's
[31:08] told you a hundred times
[31:10] well brother dale i know you got born
[31:12] again because you came out of the
[31:12] baptist church and now you're in the
[31:13] message
[31:16] right
[31:16] bob he said i was not
[31:20] he said i was two years seeking the holy
[31:22] ghost he ought to know
[31:25] two years seeking the holy ghost before
[31:27] he got born again so he went through the
[31:28] mat two years of the message of learning
[31:30] and studying and praying before god
[31:33] giving the baptism of the holy ghost so
[31:35] don't tell me that you just got it
[31:36] because you're sitting in church today
[31:38] or you just got it because you you don't
[31:39] wear pants or you don't want cut
[31:41] that's do's and don'ts
[31:45] but sanctification should get that
[31:46] unclean spirit out of you
[31:48] not at the new birth at sanctification
[31:51] all those things should go out of you
[31:53] see that's a dangerous part when we when
[31:55] we look at that we see that the devil
[31:57] can tell you at sanctification oh you're
[31:59] fine you're born again you're going to
[32:00] church aren't you you believe the
[32:01] message of the hour you're not doing
[32:02] this you're not doing that
[32:05] what'd bob say this morning
[32:08] one identification the greatest one is
[32:10] that this message of this hour is
[32:12] revealed to you over and over and over
[32:16] again and you don't just sit here with a
[32:19] bewildered look on your face no you're
[32:20] getting something
[32:22] limbs are growing
[32:24] leaves are growing
[32:25] fruit's growing something's happening
[32:29] and i believe we're in a stage where
[32:30] something's happening now
[32:32] something's happening to all of us
[32:34] the ones that's coming in the ones
[32:36] that's been baptized re-baptized we've
[32:38] rededicated our life
[32:40] so what i told you first of the year i
[32:42] said whatever you got let it out
[32:44] whether it be good bad or indifferent
[32:46] let it out
[32:48] my whole football coach said what
[32:50] lead follow or get out of the way
[32:53] and that's the way i look at it lead
[32:55] follower get out of the way
[32:57] and don't stand in somebody's way please
[32:58] don't let us stand in anybody's way
[33:00] matthew 12 43 says when the unclean
[33:02] spirit has gone out of a man what all
[33:04] that junk that you used to do
[33:08] and it didn't leave of its own accord
[33:13] it's just like i said about the ark
[33:15] there was a lot of claw marks on that
[33:17] ark when god shut the door
[33:19] same way with them evil spirits
[33:21] oh i just it just fell out of me and i'm
[33:24] just
[33:25] yeah right
[33:27] no i fought mine
[33:29] and there were some scratch marks going
[33:31] out the door as he went out
[33:33] he didn't want to leave
[33:34] but i did go through a stage of
[33:36] sanctification where i was cleaned out
[33:38] the snuff box did go out the door the
[33:40] cursing did go out the door that
[33:42] whatever i was doing went out the door
[33:44] sanctification but i had been taught
[33:46] well by brother dale because i could
[33:47] have come in and sat down and said well
[33:48] that's my birth
[33:49] that was not my birth i still was
[33:52] confused on matters and confused on
[33:54] certain things that i were that i was
[33:56] reading in the message of the hour but
[33:58] when god gave me the baptism of the holy
[34:00] ghost brother john all that come pieces

[34:42] when the unclean spirit is going out of
[34:43] a man he walketh through dry places seek
[34:45] and rest and find us none
[34:47] then he said i will return where
[34:49] into my house
[34:51] he's still got possession of it
[34:54] read your bible
[34:56] into my house from whence i came out
[34:59] this is an evil spirit talking
[35:02] i'm comfortable in that house right
[35:03] there
[35:04] but something has made me uncomfortable
[35:06] something has thrown me out
[35:09] and i look though he's come back
[35:12] and he finds it empty swept and
[35:13] garnished
[35:15] you start going to church
[35:17] i'll read to you in just a few minutes
[35:19] he goes and taketh what
[35:21] he's going to bring seven of his buddies
[35:24] and he's not going you're not gonna be a
[35:25] seven time more drunk he's gonna put you
[35:27] in church
[35:28] he's going to bring seven religious
[35:30] demons with him and they're going to put
[35:32] you in a message church and you're going
[35:33] to sit there and say i'm fine
[35:37] listen
[35:38] brother dale's 82 years old he's been in
[35:41] this message for 60 something years i
[35:43] don't believe there's a day he woke up
[35:44] and said i'm fine
[35:47] right pop
[35:48] i'm fine no it's a struggle it's a
[35:50] battle
[35:52] listen we'll talk about tonight or this
[35:54] afternoon even when joshua placed them
[35:57] in the promised land
[35:59] that was blessed
[36:01] there was battles
[36:03] there was heartaches
[36:07] in the promised land
[36:09] in this adoption stage
[36:15] so get ready brother brown said he's
[36:17] going to turn every gun satan is
[36:20] because he likes his he wants his house
[36:22] back
[36:25] because i remember brother brown said
[36:26] he's got dibs on you because you were
[36:27] born in sin shape and iniquity
[36:30] okay
[36:31] and the last state of that man is worse
[36:33] than the first
[36:35] even so shall it be unto this wicked
[36:37] generation second timothy 2 verse 19
[36:40] says nevertheless the foundation
[36:42] of god stands sure having this seal the
[36:44] lord knoweth them that are his
[36:46] and let everyone that nameth the name of
[36:48] christ depart from iniquity
[36:50] but in a great house there are not only
[36:52] vessels of gold and silver but also wood
[36:54] and earth some of honor and some to
[36:56] dishonor if a man therefore purge
[36:58] himself
[37:01] remember clean and set aside for service
[37:03] you're not in service yet you're in line
[37:05] for adoption but you're not even in the
[37:07] family yet
[37:08] all right
[37:10] if a man therefore purge himself from
[37:12] these he should be a vessel and honor
[37:14] what he made a choice
[37:17] we have a choice satan had a choice the
[37:20] angels had a choice
[37:21] abel had a choice cain had a choice adam
[37:23] had a choice eve had a choice
[37:26] if the devil himself had a choice so do
[37:27] you
[37:29] god made a choice
[37:31] god chose us yes
[37:33] he didn't choose to stay by himself he
[37:35] chose to have a mini-member body a bride
[37:38] hallelujah
[37:40] and meet for the white master's use
[37:44] and prepared unto every good work that's
[37:47] sanctification
[37:48] that's not the new birth it's heading
[37:50] you toward that it's a work of the holy
[37:53] ghost but remember that thing's not
[37:55] sealed yet whatever was inside can get
[37:57] back in
[37:59] you got a what you got to seal it
[38:03] and then what then what's good to seal
[38:05] this oh brother i got this water sealed
[38:07] it can't get out
[38:10] i want to drink this
[38:14] so god's going to break the cell
[38:18] um
[38:21] remember the boxcar brother brown talks
[38:23] about
[38:24] when i watched inside that boxcar junk
[38:27] no he said goods
[38:29] in other words a boxcar full of of say
[38:32] chicken
[38:34] this is chicken country
[38:36] but what's a box box car full of chicken
[38:38] gonna do you if it stays in a box car
[38:42] amen but it's sealed
[38:44] but at that in that journey somewhere
[38:46] that seal is going to have to be broke
[38:48] and then what's inside is going to have
[38:50] to come out that's what i said before
[38:52] whatever you got inside of you let it
[38:53] out
[38:54] good bad or indifferent
[38:57] so now watch judas this carrot was
[38:59] justified by faith oh my lord
[39:02] and believed on the lord jesus christ
[39:04] and was baptized everybody still
[39:07] believed brother brown was a prophet i
[39:08] hadn't we're still here okay all right
[39:10] thank you and believing on the lord
[39:12] jesus christ and was baptized
[39:15] and the bible said jesus baptized the
[39:17] disciples his disciples all right
[39:19] so before he could send them out he said
[39:20] sanctify them father so now we're at
[39:22] sanctification but now remember it can't
[39:24] be the sanctification right here that he
[39:26] puts you ready in service in the body
[39:29] he's still down here you're not in the
[39:31] body of christ yet everybody with me
[39:33] all right
[39:36] what's that thing brother stephen says
[39:37] all the time he'll say something to the
[39:40] congregation he'll say you know are you
[39:41] with me or he'll say
[39:43] are you hearing me or something it's
[39:45] cute i like it
[39:47] you have to get them every once in a
[39:48] while get their attention back
[39:50] sanctify them father through the truth
[39:52] that word
[39:53] we have to get them before they go to
[39:54] land or nod
[39:58] you'll get that in a minute thy word is
[40:00] truth
[40:02] and he was the word even before the
[40:04] atonement was made and what's the
[40:06] atonement
[40:07] the holy ghost
[40:08] before the atonement was made in other
[40:10] words as a preview father of my shed
[40:12] blood blood i sanctify these he gave
[40:15] them power against unclean spirits they
[40:17] went out and they cast out devils is
[40:19] that right they healed the sick they
[40:21] came back sanctified rejoicing jumping
[40:23] shouting and praising god doesn't that
[40:24] sound like a good message meeting
[40:29] and said even the devils is subject to
[40:32] us and jesus said don't you rejoice
[40:34] because the devil's accepted to you but
[40:36] rejoice because your names are written
[40:38] in the book of heaven is that right
[40:40] and judas iscariot was with them
[40:44] one of them i'm one of them see jesus
[40:47] the judas can sing that same song one of
[40:48] them i'm one of them
[40:50] yeah he was one of them all right
[40:54] but he fooled everybody listen to me
[40:56] this is this this is the point i want to
[40:57] make he fooled everybody but the son of
[41:00] man
[41:02] and that's what we're trying to get to
[41:03] we get to the message of the son of man
[41:05] not the son of god to the son of man i'm
[41:06] sorry to the son of man
[41:09] everybody with me the son of man is the
[41:11] only one that knew where satan was
[41:14] all the other all the other church ages
[41:17] were they were just scrambling around
[41:18] trying to figure out what's going on and
[41:20] right up to the right up to the
[41:22] crucifixion they was like well jesus is
[41:25] a good guy
[41:26] judas has been messaged for 30 years
[41:29] he was called just like we were
[41:35] we've seen it happen before brother
[41:37] john's seen it itself personally
[41:40] walk through life and
[41:41] think these people are
[41:44] saints of god
[41:48] called out sanctified
[41:50] and his name was written in the lounge
[41:51] book of white but remember it wasn't
[41:52] written in the eternal section
[41:55] because his name was erased
[41:57] said read matthew 10 and see if that's
[41:59] not right he called each one of them and
[42:01] judas and every one of them right down
[42:02] there he sent them out and gave them
[42:04] power against unclean spirits jesus knew
[42:07] who he was and still sanctified him
[42:14] but he didn't go to pentecost
[42:16] that's his problem he did not go to
[42:17] pentecost so let's read this next one
[42:19] from a hidden life i love this little
[42:21] sermon here how the thing was refreshing
[42:23] in the presence notice another thing
[42:25] once in the presence of god
[42:28] hold on a minute brother branham
[42:32] once in the presence of god
[42:34] we're supposed to be shouting and
[42:36] speaking in tongues and
[42:39] we still believe one more time is
[42:40] everybody all right well brother brown
[42:42] was the prophet we believe what do you
[42:43] see you get quieted
[42:46] because if you don't know what you're
[42:47] shouting about first you're just
[42:48] shouting that like brother brown said
[42:50] you're just tooting your whistle
[42:51] but if you get quieted first
[42:53] be still and know that i'm god
[42:56] be still and know that i have the new
[42:57] birth and that's why i'm shouting
[42:59] not why not i'm shouting because
[43:01] everybody else is shouting
[43:03] not shouting because of that anointing
[43:04] as brother was talking about that it's
[43:06] not a false anointing listen it's not a
[43:07] false holy ghost
[43:09] it's the true holy ghost on a false
[43:11] believer
[43:12] that's the problem that we see annoying
[43:14] ones at the end time it's a true holy
[43:16] ghost anointing someone that's black in
[43:18] their soul because they haven't been
[43:20] taught right
[43:21] they think they're fine they think
[43:22] everything's all right and they're not
[43:25] once in the presence of god you get
[43:26] quieted
[43:27] you're not tossed about by everything
[43:30] you know where you're standing
[43:32] there something happens
[43:36] you know that you've been in contact
[43:38] with somebody that loves you
[43:41] wow
[43:42] you know that something's happened down
[43:45] here
[43:46] and it's refreshing
[43:49] and not only that
[43:51] but you will refresh others
[43:54] well since i got a new bird boat away
[43:56] people can't stand to be around me you
[43:57] need to get a new birth
[44:02] you don't need just an anointing you
[44:03] need to get the new birth amen
[44:05] i know some of y'all can't stand to be
[44:07] around me but that's your fault
[44:09] you
[44:11] [Applause]
[44:12] quit clapping
[44:16] yeah i know it keeps you from sleeping i
[44:17] know that you've seen people that was
[44:19] nice people but you just couldn't hardly
[44:20] stand to be around them
[44:23] there's something about them
[44:25] they got a creative power
[44:27] around them that just seems to be
[44:30] different
[44:31] how i'd like to stop here if it was
[44:33] possible to tell you something on that
[44:34] you're a little creator yourself
[44:37] wow
[44:38] now this is why i brought this in
[44:40] because he's talking about
[44:40] sanctification he's over there in in the
[44:42] old testament talking about the new
[44:43] spirit and the old and the stony heart
[44:46] and the heart of flesh because everybody
[44:48] thinks they get the new birth and
[44:50] they're not they just get a new spirit
[44:51] watch he said he'd give you a new spirit
[44:53] now that spirit isn't god's spirit right
[44:55] right everybody with me
[44:59] he's quoting the bible
[45:02] i can't remember the ezekiel i think it
[45:04] is
[45:05] thank you and that spirit isn't god's
[45:07] spirit now listen what is the holy ghost
[45:10] that's god's spirit
[45:11] the holy ghost is god's spirit inside of
[45:14] you that's the new birth so he's not
[45:16] talking about that he said that spirit
[45:18] isn't god's spirit that's your spirit
[45:21] everybody's still with me still believe
[45:22] brother okay all right don't leave
[45:25] god gives you a new spirit then he says
[45:27] i'll put my spirit in him but the thing
[45:30] god has to do is give you a new spirit
[45:32] make your nature
[45:34] a little more gentle
[45:38] and what
[45:40] huh
[45:42] settle down
[45:44] you see people that's tossed about
[45:47] i've said before
[45:48] we all got a boat
[45:50] we're all a big boat
[45:52] but what runs the boat
[45:54] that one rudder in the bottom of that
[45:55] boat is only about this big that boat
[45:57] can be as big as this room
[45:59] and that rudder about that big and about
[46:01] that long
[46:02] if it's not on that every wind is going
[46:04] to blow you this way
[46:06] and that other wind is going to blow you
[46:08] that way
[46:09] i'm going to blow you to that church i'm
[46:10] going to blow you i'll get off of that
[46:12] but anyway so god gives you a spiritual
[46:15] rudder
[46:17] that when that wind blows you can turn
[46:19] it doesn't matter if it turns the ship i
[46:20] was telling you before we were flying
[46:22] into canada to bear hunt me and dad were
[46:24] and we were on a puddle jumper and i
[46:26] couldn't see the runway brother john all
[46:27] i saw was trees we were coming in
[46:29] sideways the wind was like 40 miles an
[46:30] hour across wind i was looking out the
[46:32] sidewinder and i said uh that's the
[46:34] runway
[46:36] i was looking at the pilot over here
[46:38] because it was polo jumpers that didn't
[46:40] have the doors you could see the pilot
[46:41] but what happened was they had a rudder
[46:44] they had a tail rudder and they had
[46:46] rudder on the wing so what happened
[46:47] right as soon as we got close to that
[46:49] they turned that rudder when they did we
[46:50] sit right down on the runway just like
[46:52] we're supposed to that's the same way
[46:53] with god
[46:54] we have a spiritual rudder now that
[46:56] gives us what it gives us purpose
[46:59] when we turn that thing it's because the
[47:01] wind's blowing this way if we turn it
[47:02] back this way because the wind's blowing
[47:04] this way
[47:05] so he had to get you fixed up first
[47:07] before he can come in you
[47:09] wow no i just got it's okay you might
[47:12] have got it all at one time that's all
[47:13] right
[47:14] show me the fruits
[47:16] don't don't lay out a church and be in
[47:18] six weeks and be gone and be done this
[47:20] and can't do this and can't do that and
[47:22] don't live for god you didn't get it
[47:25] let's just really be honest with each
[47:26] other
[47:27] if you got the holy ghost you'll be in
[47:28] church
[47:31] well i got that no god didn't ask about
[47:33] no stipulations
[47:37] so he has to get you fixed up first
[47:39] before he can come in
[47:41] i'll give you a new spirit then you take
[47:43] him anywhere you go all kinds of places
[47:47] what you don't go to the bar rooms
[47:48] anymore
[47:49] right you don't go to the hockey's home
[47:51] you don't go to this place in that place
[47:53] you go to a different place
[47:55] you go all kinds of places he's got to
[47:57] get you fixed so he can what
[47:59] so you can entertain him right
[48:03] so that's when you're on the first altar
[48:07] you're not born again yet
[48:11] but when you hide away and get his
[48:13] spirit
[48:15] then the holy spirit none other than god
[48:17] himself comes and dwells in you and
[48:20] that's right here that's at the new
[48:22] birth at the baptism of holy ghost
[48:24] that's that faith to put you in the body
[48:27] that he can put you in service you're
[48:28] not in service yet without the holy
[48:30] ghost
[48:31] and then there's something about you the
[48:33] neighbor loves you the people likes you
[48:37] let's read first peter one verse two
[48:38] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[48:40] god the father through what
[48:42] sanctification of the spirit
[48:44] what is sanctification clean and set
[48:46] aside for service so you're cleaned up
[48:48] god gives you a new spirit he gives you
[48:49] a heart of flesh but he doesn't put his
[48:51] spirit in yet
[48:53] hello somebody
[48:56] he's waiting to see what you're going to
[48:58] do you say by the way god already knows
[49:01] what yeah he knows what you're gonna do
[49:02] but you don't
[49:06] unto obedience
[49:08] where does obedience come in why when i
[49:10] get the holy ghost i'm just no at
[49:12] sanctification you need to start being a
[49:14] bit obedient
[49:18] according to peter
[49:20] he ought to know
[49:21] he was not very obedient until he got
[49:23] the holy ghost
[49:24] he was cutting ears off cursing god
[49:26] running away from god going fishing
[49:30] right
[49:31] but when he got the holy ghost what was
[49:32] he first one out
[49:34] first one out the door and the first one
[49:36] to tell us we needed these virtues faith
[49:38] virtue and always temptation godliness
[49:40] brotherly kindness and love
[49:42] sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ
[49:43] grace unto you and peace be multiplied
[49:45] brother brown says on the interval god
[49:47] prophesied through the prophet and said
[49:48] i will write my laws in their hearts
[49:51] where i put them in the tables of their
[49:52] hearts showing that that would be the
[49:54] dwelling place of god
[49:55] in the human heart not the human head
[49:58] everybody with me on that
[50:00] human heart not this thing it's
[50:01] something right here it's the heart of
[50:03] you the core of you what you think it's
[50:05] it's your attitude your aptitude your
[50:07] altitude
[50:09] i will write them in my heart and in
[50:11] their heart and they'll keep my statutes
[50:13] and so forth saith the lord god sent in
[50:16] another place over in ezekiel said i
[50:17] will in that day take out your old
[50:19] fleshly stony heart and i'll give you a
[50:21] new spirit and i'll put my spirit in you
[50:23] now a lot of people even you pentecostal
[50:25] people a lot of times get mistaken in
[50:27] that
[50:28] if we got some pentecostal ideas in here
[50:30] today let me just ask you that question
[50:32] even you pentecostal people a lot of
[50:34] times got mistaken on that you get a new
[50:36] spirit that's not god's spirit
[50:39] amen that's you
[50:41] that isn't god you get a little happy
[50:43] because you got a new spirit and you
[50:44] jump up and down run around the floor
[50:46] maybe shout a little bit speak with
[50:48] tongues run around a little bit and
[50:49] think you got the holy ghost that's not
[50:51] it
[50:53] that's not it
[50:54] that's a new spirit god gave you that's
[50:57] you then after he gives you your spirit
[51:00] then he said i'll put my spirit that's
[51:02] what's a matter with missed meal cramps
[51:04] you get today
[51:06] amen wow that's the reason you can't get
[51:09] nowhere with god that's what we're
[51:10] trying to do we're trying to get
[51:11] somewhere with god
[51:13] we're not trying to get somewhere with
[51:15] the world
[51:16] we're trying to get somewhere with god
[51:17] you see people out there in the world
[51:19] trying to build their own kingdom that's
[51:21] what that's in their mind that's what
[51:23] they want they want all the money they
[51:24] can get all the power all the authority
[51:27] all the rulership yes they're going to
[51:29] hell if they don't get the baptism by
[51:30] the holy ghost
[51:32] and on the day of judgment they're not
[51:34] going to stand any taller than the next
[51:35] person
[51:38] notice you put a new spirit god has to
[51:40] give you a new spirit or you couldn't
[51:42] even get along with him
[51:45] you can't get along with yourself
[51:47] that old devil spirit you had in you
[51:49] preach it brother brown i'm going to say
[51:50] it
[51:51] so he's got to put a new spirit in you
[51:53] so you can get along with his spirit
[51:55] amen
[51:56] i'll put a new spirit in them and i will
[51:58] put my spirit in them and he said after
[52:00] he gives you a new spirit
[52:02] after he's given you a new spirit that's
[52:04] you don't get it confused with god's
[52:05] spirit it's not
[52:08] it's your new spirit so you can get
[52:09] along with the holy ghost
[52:11] if he ever gives it to you
[52:15] if he ever gives it to you
[52:17] oh brother wait i was just before the
[52:19] foundation world yeah the mind of god
[52:20] you were
[52:22] in the mind of god you were an eternal
[52:23] seed but down here you were not
[52:27] you were born in sin shaped and iniquity
[52:28] the things i did god was not in my body
[52:30] when i was doing those things i was
[52:31] doing if everybody's okay with that can
[52:33] we say amen amen i knew i was lost
[52:36] i had a seed of representation i knew
[52:38] when the word came to me that i would
[52:39] respond and god knew that but you know
[52:41] what it was because i made a choice
[52:43] as long as you'll preach that seed with
[52:44] a choice i'll agree with you but you
[52:46] preach that seed with no choice you're
[52:47] wrong
[52:49] and i will put my spirit in them and he
[52:51] said after he give you a new spirit that
[52:52] why would he give you all this
[52:54] stuff if you already had it
[52:58] it's not it's your new spirit so you can
[53:00] get along with the holy spirit if he
[53:01] ever gives it to you amen because you
[53:04] and your condition
[53:05] never get along
[53:07] you can't get along with your wife how
[53:09] many people can say amen to that
[53:12] please don't say man y'all are not
[53:13] supposed to do that
[53:15] your wife's most of them sitting right
[53:16] here
[53:18] i can get along with mine she might not
[53:19] get along with me but i sure can get
[53:20] along with mine
[53:22] i can't get along without mine
[53:25] leave me for an older man
[53:28] her daddy let me make that clear her
[53:30] father
[53:32] you can't get along with your husband
[53:33] can't get along with your neighbor how
[53:35] you ever going to get along with god
[53:38] so he has to give you a new spirit
[53:40] before you can get along with him so he
[53:41] puts a new spirit in you and then he
[53:43] puts his spirit in you
[53:45] gives you a new spirit a new outlook
[53:48] a new faith
[53:50] then he puts his holy spirit in you
[53:53] that's what we're going to talk about
[53:54] just for a few minutes the baptism of
[53:56] the holy ghost
[53:57] i want us to every person
[53:59] i think it was maybe saint martin one
[54:01] that didn't that didn't didn't rest
[54:03] until he knew everybody in his
[54:04] congregation had the baptism of the holy
[54:06] ghost well we got a pretty good size
[54:08] congregation
[54:09] but i sure want every one of you to have
[54:11] the baptism of the holy ghost
[54:13] i want you to have the new birth not on
[54:15] your spirit i want you to have it in
[54:16] your soul
[54:17] so that you can respond to god
[54:19] amen that's my that's my my plea every
[54:22] time up before i walk out that door
[54:26] first peter 1 verse 42 says seeing you
[54:29] have purified your souls now you can't
[54:31] do it but god can't
[54:32] when he puts his soul inside of you
[54:35] that's god's
[54:36] soul perfect eternal
[54:41] can't sin yes that's what god's looking
[54:44] at
[54:46] let's get right with this thing that's
[54:47] what god's looking at he's looking at
[54:50] that he took uh his soul and put it
[54:52] inside of you
[54:54] not a second person not a third person
[54:58] i've said before we gotta start
[55:00] realizing that we're not part of god
[55:06] john's got that furrow and isn't it
[55:08] most people do that when i say that
[55:12] we're not a second person
[55:15] god
[55:16] is god
[55:18] satan wants to be like him
[55:20] satan wants to be him
[55:22] and without the new birth
[55:25] you and i can't be god
[55:28] but we're not a second person
[55:31] jesus prayed in saint john 17. he said
[55:33] god he said father i pray that they and
[55:36] me be one
[55:39] as the father and i are one how many
[55:41] were they one
[55:46] i don't want to be like god
[55:49] i want to be god amen
[55:52] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[55:54] my soul is god because if there's any
[55:56] party you left in there it's not done
[55:59] the work is not finished
[56:01] because he's going to judge your soul
[56:03] he's not going to judge your spirit he's
[56:04] going to judge your soul
[56:06] he's going to get right down in that
[56:07] center person
[56:09] and if there's anybody in there beside
[56:11] god brother john you're going to have to
[56:13] give account for your works
[56:15] please don't let me have to give account
[56:16] for my works let me give let me go up
[56:19] there and say oh
[56:20] i took you lord
[56:22] whatever he done put it on him
[56:26] didn't jesus say cast your burdens
[56:28] on me
[56:30] give it to me
[56:32] that's a problem we give it to him and
[56:34] go like i said before we go fishing in
[56:35] the sea of forgetfulness
[56:38] put a new fish inside there and leave it
[56:40] alone
[56:45] seeing you have purified your souls and
[56:47] obeying the truth
[56:49] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[56:51] of the brethren see that you love one
[56:53] another with a pure heart fervently
[56:58] being born again
[57:00] not a corruptible seed
[57:02] if you always was eternal why'd you need
[57:04] to be born again
[57:05] listen folks we were born wrong
[57:09] we had a we had an adamic nature we had
[57:12] a satanic nature
[57:16] if you don't get rid of that
[57:18] it becomes you
[57:20] and you vulcanize with satan just like
[57:22] brother brown said we vulcanize with god
[57:24] when we get the new birth
[57:26] when we get the new birth we vulcanize
[57:28] with god
[57:29] now when you vulcanize something i know
[57:31] brother john's about he's a little
[57:32] younger than i am but i can remember
[57:34] putting patches on tires
[57:36] especially my bicycle
[57:38] because we just poor folks back then
[57:41] and we had to patch our patches
[57:43] but what you do you heat it up you
[57:45] didn't go find a piece of wood
[57:48] or a feather
[57:50] you got another piece of what rubber
[57:53] you got a piece of god
[57:55] and you took that and by the baptism of
[57:57] the holy ghost and fire
[58:00] you had to put the fire to it oh you put
[58:02] the glue on there you know if you slap
[58:03] that patch on there you
[58:05] pump up and here's this big old ball of
[58:08] of uh like a balloon pops up why you
[58:10] didn't vulcanize it
[58:14] we got to vulcanize with god that's why
[58:15] i said we we can't be we we lean on the
[58:18] oneness that we're they're on this side
[58:20] we lean on the trinitarians and and we
[58:22] become the worst tunis it ever was it's
[58:25] me and god
[58:26] no it's god
[58:28] he decided you were going to be him
[58:32] he decided you were going to do these
[58:34] things and he wrote it in his bible
[58:38] but you have to start as a child of god
[58:40] just like each one of you had to start
[58:42] you have all your faculties everything
[58:43] you need except what except your growth
[58:47] except your development of your
[58:48] intelligence
[58:50] then you can drive a car abby's 15 now
[58:53] bless everybody's heart in banks county
[58:57] but she's going to be able to drive
[58:58] because what the law of the land says
[59:00] that she has come we're not going to
[59:02] talk about my grandbaby the law says
[59:04] that she has come to a place of maturity
[59:07] that now she can go to the next step and
[59:09] they give her a certificate
[59:11] if she passes the test
[59:15] always is a test
[59:17] always to have a testimony you gotta
[59:19] have a test first
[59:21] because one day what she's gonna do is
[59:22] she's gonna say i got my license
[59:25] well that's a testimony
[59:27] to her test
[59:29] and then her mom and daddy's gonna have
[59:30] a real test
[59:34] they did buy her hummer though so that's
[59:35] good
[59:39] either that or a tank they couldn't find
[59:40] an army tank so they got they got a
[59:42] hummer
[59:44] just don't hit anybody else
[59:46] but being born again not of corruptible
[59:48] seed but of the incred of incorruptible
[59:51] by what by the word of god
[59:53] you're not born again because your mama
[59:54] got born again or your daddy got born
[59:56] again or your pastor got born again
[59:57] you're born again by the incorruptible
[59:59] word of god you have to hear the word of
[1:00:01] god why does the seed have to come
[1:00:02] through the body why did why did paul
[1:00:04] have to go why did he have to go and
[1:00:06] find a nice
[1:00:09] i just got knocked off my horse and i
[1:00:11] believe this message no that ain't what
[1:00:13] happened paul actually got physically
[1:00:15] blinded
[1:00:17] and had to be led
[1:00:19] to the life
[1:00:21] i said life he saw the light but he had
[1:00:24] to be led to the life
[1:00:26] and nice pray for this guy lord you
[1:00:28] really
[1:00:29] he's killing us oh i got to work for him
[1:00:31] don't you worry about it
[1:00:32] why god was talking to one of his kids
[1:00:34] he was talking to his child a nice and
[1:00:37] paul was getting ready to come into the
[1:00:38] body
[1:00:39] everybody with me
[1:00:40] for all fleshes is grass and all the
[1:00:42] glory of man is the flower of grass the
[1:00:44] grass withereth and the flower there'll
[1:00:45] fall us away just like our flesh but the
[1:00:48] word of god endureth forever and this is
[1:00:50] a word by the gospel that is preached
[1:00:53] unto you ephesians 1 verse 10 so that in
[1:00:56] the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:00:57] times he might gather together in one
[1:00:59] all things in christ both which are in
[1:01:01] heaven and which are on earth in other
[1:01:03] words he's there in here
[1:01:05] even in him in whom also we have
[1:01:06] obtained an inheritance
[1:01:09] remember i told you before brother brown
[1:01:10] told us he said he said jesus didn't
[1:01:12] come to bring us an inheritance
[1:01:15] think about that so that's where they'll
[1:01:17] get the furrow in their eyes if they
[1:01:18] hadn't heard it before
[1:01:19] brother mom tells us in the adoption
[1:01:21] series
[1:01:22] he said jesus didn't come to bring you
[1:01:23] in
[1:01:24] your heritage he said beg your pardon
[1:01:27] jesus didn't come to bring you an
[1:01:28] inheritance
[1:01:31] your inheritance was before the
[1:01:32] foundational world he just came here to
[1:01:33] get you a way back to it
[1:01:39] jesus never gave us an inheritance we
[1:01:42] already had an inheritance
[1:01:44] in the mind of god
[1:01:46] before the foundational world
[1:01:48] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:01:50] inheritance being predestinated
[1:01:52] according to the purpose of him who
[1:01:53] worketh all things after the council of
[1:01:56] his own will that we should be the
[1:01:57] praise of his glory he first trusted in
[1:01:59] christ and whom he also trusted look
[1:02:01] after
[1:02:03] after you heard the word of truth you
[1:02:04] didn't trust them before you heard the
[1:02:05] word
[1:02:06] you trusted your own self
[1:02:08] you trusted them demons that was talking
[1:02:10] to you
[1:02:11] hello
[1:02:14] maybe y'all didn't come the same way i
[1:02:15] did some of y'all just looking at me
[1:02:17] kind of strange
[1:02:20] usually the devil looks at you kind of
[1:02:21] strange
[1:02:24] you'll get that in a minute too
[1:02:27] the gospel of your salvation
[1:02:29] how many times did brother ryan say oh i
[1:02:30] wish you could see the faces of the
[1:02:32] people now what it was those demons
[1:02:34] rising up out of those people it wasn't
[1:02:35] that he was just discerning this little
[1:02:37] black thing sitting on their shoulder he
[1:02:38] saw their reaction to what he was
[1:02:40] talking about
[1:02:41] but look in whom the gospel of your
[1:02:43] salvation whom also after that you
[1:02:45] believed
[1:02:46] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:02:49] promise which is the earnest of our
[1:02:50] inheritance listen down payment down
[1:02:53] here then you've got seven payments you
[1:02:55] got to make
[1:03:00] seven
[1:03:00] payments
[1:03:02] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:03:04] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:03:05] possession
[1:03:06] unto the praise of his glory john 14
[1:03:08] verse 15 says if you love me keep my
[1:03:10] commandments this is where i was getting
[1:03:11] to right here watch can you believe this
[1:03:14] and i will pray the father and he shall
[1:03:15] give you another comforter that you may
[1:03:17] buy that he may abide with you forever
[1:03:19] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:03:21] cannot receive
[1:03:22] because it seeth him not see not not
[1:03:25] look at understand
[1:03:27] like i said we become aliens then again
[1:03:29] we become aliens of this world we're
[1:03:31] aliens of away from god without the new
[1:03:33] birth then we become aliens of the world
[1:03:36] because we don't have anything to do
[1:03:38] with them
[1:03:38] what is in all the movies that you see
[1:03:40] aliens come from another planet we can't
[1:03:42] understand them they look different
[1:03:44] praise god
[1:03:46] amen
[1:03:47] at least i'm not green
[1:03:50] but we do look different
[1:03:53] we act different
[1:03:54] there's a purity about the bride that
[1:03:55] the world don't even see that the world
[1:03:58] looks at us and goes you wear what
[1:04:01] you don't wear what
[1:04:03] you don't have a tv
[1:04:05] you do what on sunday two services oh my
[1:04:08] word
[1:04:10] i had a girl in my dentist office she
[1:04:11] said i'm leaving my church
[1:04:13] i said what you leaving church for that
[1:04:15] preacher preached over 15 minutes
[1:04:18] and i ain't gonna stand for it
[1:04:21] well my righteous indignation got up a
[1:04:22] little bit during that time
[1:04:24] they were working on my teeth but i told
[1:04:27] amy i said get that stuff out of my
[1:04:28] mouth i'm fixing to tell her something i
[1:04:30] said i looked at it i said lady i said
[1:04:31] if jesus christ can die on a cross and
[1:04:33] lay and hang on that cross for three
[1:04:34] hours
[1:04:37] for my sin i can go to church and listen
[1:04:40] to god what he's got to tell me
[1:04:42] 15 minutes won't get it done
[1:04:47] and i told her about that
[1:04:49] voice right there then amy stuck that
[1:04:50] thing back in my mouth
[1:04:56] that just gets me stirred up when people
[1:04:57] go well i want to be a christian but now
[1:04:59] 15 minutes is that
[1:05:02] grief
[1:05:03] i did i said i said lady if he hung
[1:05:05] there with nails and stripes naked in
[1:05:08] front of the world for three hours he
[1:05:11] hung there
[1:05:12] i said can't we sit and listen to the
[1:05:13] word of god for that allow mount the
[1:05:16] amount of time
[1:05:17] it never even phased her she just
[1:05:21] you know what there was nothing there
[1:05:24] i will not leave you comfortless i'll
[1:05:25] finish right here i will come to you yet
[1:05:28] a little while in the world see if me no
[1:05:30] more but you'll see me
[1:05:31] because i live you shall live also what
[1:05:33] we're going to see the alien
[1:05:36] god is an alien to this world ain't no
[1:05:38] doubt at that day
[1:05:41] hold on a minute
[1:05:43] at that day what
[1:05:45] you shall know that i am in my father
[1:05:50] and ye and me
[1:05:52] and i knew
[1:05:53] that's impossible to draw a picture of
[1:05:55] that
[1:05:56] but in my mind i can see that
[1:05:59] there stood god there stood father there
[1:06:01] stood jesus there stood the holy ghost
[1:06:03] and when i connect to that i'm standing
[1:06:05] inside that too
[1:06:07] we can't lose
[1:06:11] first corinthians 3 says in our brethren
[1:06:13] could not speak unto you as spiritual
[1:06:14] but as carnal even as the babes
[1:06:17] in christ it's okay to be a baby it's
[1:06:18] not okay to stay a baby
[1:06:20] i have fed you with milk and not with
[1:06:22] meat for hitherto you were not able to
[1:06:24] bear it neither yet are you able now
[1:06:27] he's in corinth we know how they were
[1:06:30] for a year yet carnal for whereas there
[1:06:32] is among you envying strife division and
[1:06:35] you are not carnal and walking are you
[1:06:37] not carnal and walk as men
[1:06:39] first peter 2 verse 1 says therefore
[1:06:41] laying aside all malice
[1:06:43] all guile and hypocrisies and envies and
[1:06:45] all evil speakings as newborn babes we
[1:06:47] gotta start as a baby
[1:06:50] and when you become a baby you are a
[1:06:52] little bit legalist you're in the news
[1:06:53] you're still in that spirit of do's and
[1:06:55] don'ts all right you look at people and
[1:06:57] you go
[1:07:00] then you have to you have to put some
[1:07:01] grace sam on it
[1:07:03] because without the grace they have you
[1:07:05] start running people off you know
[1:07:07] i told daddy many many times i said how
[1:07:09] you put up with these people he says
[1:07:11] they pay the bills
[1:07:12] as newborn babes desiring the sincere
[1:07:14] milk of the word
[1:07:16] that you may grow there by he's not
[1:07:18] talking about y'all we were talking
[1:07:19] about later on a long time i need to
[1:07:20] explain that he was talking a long time
[1:07:22] ago we were this was 20 years ago this
[1:07:24] is not today
[1:07:27] so some of you are still here from 20
[1:07:28] years ago
[1:07:29] anyway
[1:07:30] let's can you forget what i just said
[1:07:32] brother joe take that piece off of the
[1:07:34] internet
[1:07:35] if so be you have tasted that the lord
[1:07:37] is gracious the air just went right out
[1:07:38] of the building john 14 verse 25 says
[1:07:41] these things have i spoken unto you yet
[1:07:43] being what present with you but the
[1:07:44] comforter which is the holy ghost whom
[1:07:47] the father will send in my name he shall
[1:07:48] teach you all things hallelujah and
[1:07:51] bring all things to your remembrance
[1:07:53] what revelation
[1:07:55] whatsoever i have said unto you now the
[1:07:57] greek lexicon tells that's paracletus
[1:07:59] and that's comforter advocate one who
[1:08:01] pleads your case before a judge he's a
[1:08:04] council for defense he's a legal
[1:08:05] assistant he's an advocate we can't lose
[1:08:11] go in the courtroom and and the guy
[1:08:12] that's every piece of the of the
[1:08:15] judicial system is one man
[1:08:17] and he's our daddy
[1:08:20] one who pleads another's calls with one
[1:08:22] an intercessor so of christ in his
[1:08:24] exaltation at god's right hand pleading
[1:08:26] with god the father for the pardon of
[1:08:28] our sins let's continue on down i want
[1:08:30] to get to something wherefore i give you
[1:08:31] to understand that no man speaketh by
[1:08:33] the spirit of god calleth jesus the
[1:08:35] curse now watch that's why that as we
[1:08:37] were talking when we first started
[1:08:39] there is a there is a teaching in the
[1:08:41] message that you've got to get all these
[1:08:43] virtues before you get the holy spirit
[1:08:45] because you see it up there at the top
[1:08:47] that's totally untrue
[1:08:49] totally untrue you can't have these
[1:08:51] virtues
[1:08:52] and not and and not be born again
[1:08:55] because that's the virtue of god that's
[1:08:57] not the virtue of man that's not
[1:08:59] something that your mom and dad gave you
[1:09:00] the genetics of your mom and dad that's
[1:09:02] the genetics of god
[1:09:03] so look no man can say that jesus is the
[1:09:06] lord but by the holy ghost
[1:09:08] only way
[1:09:10] now let's get this real quick
[1:09:12] ii peter here's peter again simon peter
[1:09:14] servant apostle of jesus christ look to
[1:09:16] them that have obtained now he hasn't
[1:09:18] started in the virtues yet
[1:09:20] everybody with me he hasn't started in
[1:09:22] the virtues yet he said those that have
[1:09:24] obtained
[1:09:26] light precious faith with us all right
[1:09:28] so if peter had this kind of faith my
[1:09:31] finger
[1:09:32] because on the day of pentecost i
[1:09:34] believe he got born again
[1:09:37] and he said we've got to have that light
[1:09:39] precious faith
[1:09:40] so we've got to be born again before
[1:09:43] we can get these virtues
[1:09:46] with us through the righteousness of god
[1:09:47] and our savior jesus christ grace and
[1:09:49] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[1:09:50] knowledge of the god of jesus our lord
[1:09:52] look according as he as his divine power
[1:09:56] have given unto us all things that
[1:09:57] pertaineth unto what life and godliness
[1:10:00] these virtues will teach you how to
[1:10:01] raise your kids teach you how to
[1:10:06] okay well be i was gonna say something
[1:10:08] about the boss but
[1:10:10] it'll make you love your boss
[1:10:12] and people are groaning
[1:10:16] you love him and not like him
[1:10:20] let's get on to this according his
[1:10:22] divine power has given unto given unto
[1:10:24] what
[1:10:25] us all things that pertains unto life in
[1:10:27] godliness through the knowledge of him
[1:10:28] that has called us the glory and virtue
[1:10:30] we have given at us what exceeding
[1:10:32] great and precious promises that by
[1:10:35] these you might be partakers of the
[1:10:37] divine nature there's only one divine
[1:10:39] nature
[1:10:40] and that's the nature of almighty god
[1:10:42] everything else is filthy ranks
[1:10:45] amen but you can have that though by
[1:10:47] vulcanizing that together
[1:10:50] kill that old nature
[1:10:52] and let god
[1:10:53] have control
[1:10:55] you have escaped the corruption that is
[1:10:57] in the world through lust look and
[1:10:58] beside this
[1:11:00] so this is one thing
[1:11:03] and beside this besides verse one
[1:11:05] through four and besides this giving all
[1:11:07] diligence add
[1:11:10] amen add to your faith listen faith's
[1:11:13] not an ad
[1:11:15] face to birth
[1:11:17] it doesn't say add this to you it
[1:11:19] doesn't say no it says add to your faith
[1:11:23] so there's seven ads right amen we've
[1:11:25] been taught this before seven ads one
[1:11:27] two three four five six seven
[1:11:30] there's seven ads
[1:11:32] face not an ad
[1:11:34] face to birth
[1:11:36] and besides this giving all diligence ad
[1:11:40] everybody with me
[1:11:47] now let's look for just one second
[1:11:49] i will start on this this afternoon
[1:11:52] let's go to numbers 34 13 it says that
[1:11:54] moses commanded the children of israel
[1:11:56] saying this is the land which you shall
[1:11:58] inherit by lot now look this is moses
[1:12:00] talking to the children of israel now
[1:12:02] who placed them in the land though
[1:12:03] joshua placed them in the land is that
[1:12:06] all right
[1:12:07] but moses was the man of the hour
[1:12:10] to get them there
[1:12:12] everybody with me
[1:12:13] everybody see the
[1:12:16] allegory everybody see the parable that
[1:12:19] we're fixing to start here
[1:12:20] moses didn't get him in the promised
[1:12:22] land he got him to the promised land
[1:12:24] he gave him the laws he gave them the
[1:12:26] commandments he told them how to do this
[1:12:27] and how to do that but joshua was the
[1:12:29] one commissioned to take them in and
[1:12:31] brother brown said positionally place
[1:12:32] them in the land everybody with me all
[1:12:35] right this is the land which you shall
[1:12:36] inherit by lot which the lord commanded
[1:12:38] to give you unto the nine tribes and
[1:12:40] half tribes
[1:12:42] now remember
[1:12:43] i'm going to slow down just for a second
[1:12:44] there's 12 tribes of israel right
[1:12:48] for the tribe of the children of reuben
[1:12:50] according to the house of their fathers
[1:12:52] and the tribe of the children of gad
[1:12:54] according to the house of their fathers
[1:12:55] have received their inheritance and half
[1:12:58] the tribe of manasseh have received
[1:13:00] their inheritance
[1:13:01] the two tribes and a half have received
[1:13:04] their inheritance on this side jordan
[1:13:08] so if you're looking at a map we'll look
[1:13:10] at if you'll bring that map up
[1:13:12] near jericho eastward toward the sunrise
[1:13:15] so under moses
[1:13:17] there was 12 tribes of israel and
[1:13:18] they're going to bring it up here in
[1:13:19] just a second
[1:13:23] and this is a beautiful story
[1:13:26] everybody see that
[1:13:28] all right hold it right there no we got
[1:13:30] to whoa can you see that
[1:13:33] this is all the 12 tribes now now listen
[1:13:36] they're over here
[1:13:38] this is the jordan river this is the
[1:13:40] dead sea and that's the jordan river is
[1:13:41] everybody with me saying ma'am sea of
[1:13:43] galilee jordan river everybody with me
[1:13:46] this is the promised land
[1:13:49] this over here is where they coming out
[1:13:51] of the what they're coming out of the
[1:13:52] wilderness of sin they're coming out of
[1:13:54] coming out of sanctification
[1:13:56] everybody with me just for a minute then
[1:13:58] we'll close
[1:13:59] all right
[1:14:00] reuben and gad are cattlemen cattlemen
[1:14:04] a lot of grass over here so they say
[1:14:06] well look what we're going to do is
[1:14:08] moses to make this short what are we
[1:14:10] going to do moses
[1:14:12] is if you don't mind we would like to
[1:14:14] have this possession because of the
[1:14:16] cattle but what we're going to do is is
[1:14:18] we're going to go over jordan and we're
[1:14:21] going to help them fight to get their
[1:14:23] position they're back with me
[1:14:25] all right
[1:14:27] can y'all see that
[1:14:29] i'm talking about these over here
[1:14:31] okay so reuben gad and half tribal
[1:14:34] manasseh why a half tribe
[1:14:36] why not a full tribe
[1:14:39] because watch what happens
[1:14:41] they all go over and fight and then they
[1:14:42] come back
[1:14:44] this is their possession
[1:14:46] justification
[1:14:50] who's reuben reuben's the firstborn
[1:14:54] justification got to start somewhere
[1:14:56] sanctification i'm trying to hurry up
[1:15:00] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:15:02] but what does the baptism of the holy
[1:15:03] ghost do it's got to continue over into
[1:15:05] the promised land
[1:15:07] to get your other half
[1:15:08] tribe everybody with me
[1:15:11] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:15:13] the holy ghost because look you say oh
[1:15:15] brother wait that's the promised land no
[1:15:16] you're not you're not placed
[1:15:19] remember the holy ghost is different
[1:15:20] from the position the holy ghost is
[1:15:23] different from adoption this is the holy
[1:15:24] ghost this is adoption
[1:15:27] everybody with me over here
[1:15:29] this is adoption this is the placing of
[1:15:31] every one of them gets a certain spot
[1:15:34] but reuben again
[1:15:36] and half tribal manasseh said we're
[1:15:37] going to go over there and help you
[1:15:39] fight we're going to send the holy ghost
[1:15:40] over there to fight
[1:15:42] because without the holy ghost you can't
[1:15:44] find anyway
[1:15:45] so they're going to go over there and
[1:15:46] fight but they're going to come back
[1:15:47] here showing that the church ages
[1:15:52] sure they were in a promised land of
[1:15:53] their own but they never were in
[1:15:55] adoption
[1:15:56] they never were placed
[1:15:58] amen
[1:16:01] this is your life justification
[1:16:02] sanctification baptism holy ghost you
[1:16:04] can stay here if you want to
[1:16:07] but the holy ghost is over here
[1:16:08] compelling you to come on across
[1:16:12] because there's a man named joshua over
[1:16:14] here
[1:16:15] that's going to positionally place you
[1:16:17] where you need to go
[1:16:19] on that side jordan on the east side of
[1:16:23] jordan
[1:16:24] that's where the virtues
[1:16:26] must be in you let's read this right
[1:16:27] here the virtues must be in us
[1:16:37] watch this
[1:16:38] then when we get true virtue we can add
[1:16:40] it to our faith
[1:16:42] that's the next foundation wall
[1:16:44] now first you must have faith
[1:16:48] faith alone won't do it
[1:16:50] oh i got brother wait i got faith yeah
[1:16:52] you got faith you're right you got baby
[1:16:54] faith
[1:16:56] but you still need a mom and a daddy
[1:16:59] you still need to take the test to get
[1:17:01] to drive to drive the car faithful
[1:17:04] everybody still believe brother was a
[1:17:05] prophet i hope you all didn't leave and
[1:17:06] come back
[1:17:07] all right faith alone won't do it
[1:17:10] you've got to what add virtue to your
[1:17:13] faith you must have virtue in order to
[1:17:16] add it to your faith
[1:17:18] and we'll get started that not not this
[1:17:20] afternoon we'll get started on something
[1:17:21] else but that i just want to give you a
[1:17:23] little snippet of that
[1:17:25] that we're going to uh get to but i love
[1:17:27] that with the uh
[1:17:30] with the um
[1:17:33] justification about
[1:17:34] justice thank you baptism the holy ghost
[1:17:38] that takes you into the promised land
[1:17:39] without these three you can't get in
[1:17:40] it's a connection
[1:17:42] that's why the half tribe stayed out
[1:17:43] here and a half tribe was over here they
[1:17:45] were connected to each other
[1:17:47] but remember
[1:17:49] they went over and helped them fight but
[1:17:51] then they came back
[1:17:53] and settled and we'll read it this
[1:17:55] afternoon where brother brown talks
[1:17:56] about the church ages
[1:17:58] they were under revelation of the son of
[1:18:00] god
[1:18:01] not the son of man
[1:18:02] they didn't come to adoption they were
[1:18:04] not even they were not even under
[1:18:07] the mandate
[1:18:09] to come to adoption
[1:18:12] remember what i said what brother brown
[1:18:13] said he said they had just enough of the
[1:18:15] holy ghost to get saved
[1:18:18] heal the sick they can raise the dead do
[1:18:20] all these things but furthermore of the
[1:18:21] word is what we're talking about from
[1:18:23] now on the word is right here
[1:18:25] the listen
[1:18:27] these are all the children of israel
[1:18:31] they had to be the children of israel to
[1:18:33] even get any land
[1:18:35] so you got to get born again to even get
[1:18:38] in line to get any land
[1:18:40] but this is not all the land we want
[1:18:42] everybody else wanted some more
[1:18:45] they went on across jordan they died to
[1:18:47] themselves let's stand to our feet
[1:18:48] musicians don't have to come let's just
[1:18:50] sing
[1:18:51] let's just sing a little course or
[1:18:52] something
[1:18:53] um
[1:18:56] and then we'll be dismissed but we got
[1:18:58] to come to a place to where we want
[1:19:01] to go across even the ones that got
[1:19:03] anyone reuben again
[1:19:05] and east manassas they wanted to go
[1:19:07] across and help their brothers
[1:19:10] because that was the strength that came
[1:19:11] across the strength of the new birth
[1:19:13] will take you across
[1:19:15] but it's not going to give you
[1:19:17] everything in the land you got to fight
[1:19:20] for every inch of these virtues you got
[1:19:23] to fight for everything you need you got
[1:19:25] to fight every day you wake up
[1:19:28] and every day
[1:19:31] every night you go to bed
[1:19:33] when i wake up in the morning
[1:19:37] when i lay my head to rest
[1:19:39] i am blessed
[1:19:43] can you say that
[1:19:45] even those tribes that were on this side
[1:19:48] gad and reuben they realized there was
[1:19:50] green grass there and they had to grow
[1:19:52] cattle
[1:19:53] and that's why they took that side
[1:19:56] moses said but now you got to go over
[1:19:57] there and help them fight though
[1:19:59] that's what brother brown was talking
[1:20:00] about he was talking about the
[1:20:01] pentecostals and all the different ones
[1:20:02] okay you got the holy ghost what are you
[1:20:03] gonna do about it
[1:20:05] he kept compelling the pentecostals
[1:20:06] pentecostal yeah we got the new birth
[1:20:08] yeah we're just gonna lay down right
[1:20:10] here and cabbage down on this and this
[1:20:11] is it speaking in tongues is it but it
[1:20:13] doesn't matter how we live we cannot i
[1:20:14] don't have to have any virtue we don't
[1:20:16] have to have any knowledge temperance
[1:20:17] patience godliness they probably
[1:20:20] preached on it but you know what
[1:20:22] they had nobody to take them there
[1:20:26] you and i have somebody to take us there
[1:20:29] we have a moses that brought a message
[1:20:31] but what as i was with moses joshua
