[4:53] we've come to the time that that we
[4:55] don't need to be playing around Lord
[4:56] that we need to be we need to be sealed
[4:59] up
[5:00] with your word bless us Lord give us
[5:02] strength in Jesus name
[5:04] amen Revelations 6 ver1 and I
[5:09] saw something John
[5:11] saw I saw when the lamb open one of the
[5:16] seals and I heard as it were the noise
[5:18] of Thunder one of the four beasts saying
[5:21] come and see and I saw and behold a
[5:23] white horse and he that sat on him had a
[5:25] bow and a crown was given unto him and
[5:27] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[5:30] you may be seated in the Lord add his
[5:31] Blessing to the reading of the
[5:37] word I trust that everybody had a good
[5:39] week so
[5:42] far today was a bit stressful on my end
[5:45] but that's okay it always is right
[5:47] before you get ready to go on
[5:48] vacation so but uh we got to still
[5:52] continue on the thought of the first
[5:55] seal and just kind of background a
[5:57] little bit for last week or last couple
[6:00] weeks ago that when we look at these
[6:03] seals we see that it it it opens up
[6:06] something that was never known before to
[6:08] man right all right so we can we can be
[6:12] we can have
[6:15] confidence that Paul didn't see this
[6:18] ireneus Mark they didn't see this seal
[6:21] these seals like you and I are supposed
[6:23] to see them so we can have confidence
[6:26] one thing's for sure if God did
[6:29] something
[6:30] for a group of
[6:33] people and he did it for us this group
[6:36] of people and not another right they
[6:37] were a special group of people right
[6:39] amen right all right and then he opened
[6:41] up as we said before when these seals
[6:44] opened and opened a supernatural
[6:46] Fellowship a place that go that God and
[6:49] man had never been before amen and you
[6:51] say oh that was just for the brother
[6:53] random I don't think so right I think
[6:56] we're supposed to be heirs and Joint HS
[6:57] with Christ and Christ is the seal
[7:00] William brandom was not the seal Christ
[7:02] is the seal all right so it opened
[7:04] Supernatural Fellowship not with brother
[7:06] brandom and opened Supernatural
[7:07] fellowship with who Jesus Christ because
[7:11] Christ is the sealed right and then we
[7:13] talked a little bit about the divine
[7:15] nature of God being in each one of us
[7:17] and it has to be there to have
[7:18] Supernatural Fellowship you got to have
[7:20] the divine nature of God cuz without the
[7:22] divine nature of God you can't
[7:23] understand Supernatural Fellowship all
[7:25] right and then Satan we were we kind of
[7:28] backing up here a little bit
[7:30] Satan remember he
[7:32] changes started out with a white horse
[7:35] red horse black horse Pale Horse but God
[7:38] never changes God started on a white
[7:39] horse he's going to end on a white horse
[7:41] amen all right he he didn't start with a
[7:43] blue robe and then everybody gets a
[7:45] white robe no he started with white and
[7:46] he's going to end with white so God does
[7:48] not change he never does change man
[7:51] changes and Satan changes because the
[7:53] Satan can't get you one way he'll go
[7:55] around the mountain to get you in
[7:56] another Direction all right so now
[8:00] and these 200,000,000 demons released on
[8:04] not the world right they were already
[8:08] released on them the 200,000,000 demons
[8:11] the prophet said was given to drive us
[8:15] back to our spiritual Homeland right
[8:18] which is what the word of God glory what
[8:21] Abraham was looking for was not a city
[8:23] with buildings and nails and and put
[8:26] together with hammers and and and you
[8:28] know through ways and and Pharaoh would
[8:30] no he was looking for God in a man he
[8:33] was looking for God God was always
[8:35] wanting to dwell in a group of people
[8:37] amen and he saw it in one man called MDC
[8:40] but I still don't believe Abraham had
[8:42] the true Revelation like you and I have
[8:44] the true Revelation cuz Abraham didn't
[8:46] know about Jesus Christ exactly amen you
[8:49] and I did all right so now when we come
[8:53] up to the seal this thing fit and
[8:56] popping up me
[8:58] tonight
[9:04] now now look we're get to review back
[9:07] over again the first seal opened
[9:10] up white horse rider went out and him
[9:12] that sat on him had a bow Crown was
[9:14] given unto him and he went forth
[9:16] conquering and to conquer and then John
[9:19] remember John you have to take the Bible
[9:21] and look at it in a in a way that where
[9:23] John was standing at and looking at the
[9:27] vision and he was he admired this church
[9:29] Church remember in Revelations about
[9:31] about 17 or somewhere in there he just
[9:33] admired this church well now honestly
[9:37] goodness John did see a white horse go
[9:39] out riding and a man on the horse right
[9:42] but God is not wanting us just to see a
[9:45] horse he's wanting us to see the power
[9:47] behind that horse or the power that was
[9:50] given to that horse because the man gets
[9:53] off and the horse just keeps on riding
[9:55] right what the power of the people Satan
[9:57] rides on the people for long enough he
[10:00] gets them believing a certain way and
[10:02] then he just goes over and grabs another
[10:04] group of people and that's what he did
[10:05] in the First Ages there he took in and
[10:07] got a white righteous Church they were
[10:09] they were the alpha church we'll look at
[10:12] it in just a few minutes they they had
[10:15] what a baptism in the name of the Lord
[10:16] Jesus Christ they had the baptism of the
[10:19] Holy Ghost Quran they had the fruits of
[10:21] the spirit they had all these things
[10:23] working in the church correct exactly
[10:25] all right that was why that it was a
[10:28] copy C that because it would if it would
[10:30] have started with a church that wasn't
[10:32] very fundamental or a church that was
[10:34] very uh what you might say a bunch of
[10:37] babies that white horse wouldn't have
[10:39] rode out because that white horse is is
[10:41] in opposition but it's it's in a
[10:44] parallel because he wants to look just
[10:46] like what that church is everybody
[10:48] understand that amen okay he wants to
[10:50] look like that church he don't want to
[10:52] look different cuz if he looks
[10:54] different up Pops a flag right right
[10:58] something's wrong
[11:00] oh a new
[11:01] idea no no no no no they started with
[11:04] that same
[11:05] idea and he just rode right over there
[11:07] got real close to that real white church
[11:10] right and what did he start doing he
[11:13] started eroding or eating that's where
[11:15] you get into your pommer worm what did
[11:18] the pommer worm
[11:19] eat fruits of the spirit ate the fruit
[11:22] amen what's the first thing Satan's
[11:24] going to do he's going to eat the fruit
[11:26] cuz what is fruit reproduction right
[11:28] he's trying to keep a Son of God from
[11:31] being born again amen that's right
[11:34] that's what he started in the Garden of
[11:36] Eden rightly the fruit of the womb was
[11:39] supposed to been spoken word seed right
[11:41] and we got a natural thing out of it
[11:43] right all right so Satan starts and he
[11:45] gets he copycat and he goes down through
[11:48] these ages and he hides
[11:52] himself the man of sin is what it's a
[11:55] mystery of iniquity right right it's a
[11:59] mystery of iniquity so now let's go
[12:02] excuse me let's go to the Book of James
[12:04] James
[12:10] 1 and I did forget to tell you that it's
[12:13] raining real hard and and hailing
[12:15] outside so praise the
[12:20] Lord the hail was about size of a pee so
[12:22] it's not going to hurt anything but uh
[12:24] if your windows are down you got a wet
[12:26] car now on the inside
[12:31] excuse me but it is R it was raining
[12:33] pretty hard just a few moments ago it's
[12:34] quit Okay thank the Lord for the rain
[12:38] anyway we needed it James
[12:43] 1 verse
[12:49] 13 let's read 12 blessed is a man that
[12:53] endureth
[12:55] Temptation for when he is tried he shall
[12:58] receive the crown of Life which the Lord
[13:00] hath promised to them that love him
[13:03] right let no man say when he is tempted
[13:05] I am tempted of God so don't worry if
[13:07] you're being tempted it's not of God all
[13:10] right but now God allows Satan to tempt
[13:13] you for God cannot be tempted with evil
[13:17] neither tempteth he any man right but
[13:20] every man is tempted when he is drawn
[13:22] away of his own lust a
[13:27] own lust right and enticed right then
[13:33] when lust hath conceived it bringeth
[13:36] forth sin and sin when it's finished
[13:38] bringeth forth death now if you'll
[13:41] remember back several years ago brother
[13:44] Dale preached on this and and we've done
[13:46] it a few times away from here but lust
[13:48] lust conception sin and death those are
[13:51] four things just like your four horse
[13:53] riders just like your four your first
[13:55] four seals you can parallel those
[13:57] together but what is does it start out
[13:59] with it start out it starts out with
[14:01] lust right when lust is
[14:04] conceived it bringeth for sin amen all
[14:08] right so
[14:09] now and we're looking at the mystery of
[14:12] iniquity what's the first thing Satan
[14:13] remember the Battle Ground started in
[14:16] heaven right when Satan lusted after a
[14:20] different Kingdom than what God had
[14:22] exactly he wanted something better than
[14:25] his
[14:26] maker correct right and you see what it
[14:29] got him it got him thrown out of heaven
[14:33] right right so when lust ha conceived it
[14:36] bringing forth sin look how it keeps
[14:38] progressing keeps progressing more and
[14:42] more but now let's look at
[14:45] this
[14:48] lust and remember and it's a hard thing
[14:51] to say
[14:52] but lust is something we deal with yeah
[14:56] because it's a part of our life it's a
[14:58] part of our our being is the thing that
[14:59] got us in trouble to start with yeah
[15:02] okay I don't believe Eve lusted after
[15:05] the beast but that part was still opened
[15:08] up to the lust part and then she took it
[15:11] to Adam and then here we are but and
[15:15] it's not it's not bad to to have good
[15:18] thoughts about your wife your spouse
[15:20] whatever your
[15:21] husband but this mystery of iniquity
[15:25] iniquity is something that you
[15:27] do and you should not have done it and
[15:30] you knew it wasn't that ignorance is
[15:32] okay it's all right to be ignorant of
[15:34] something if you were if it was not in
[15:36] ever taught in this church that that
[15:39] cursing was bad and nobody ever in your
[15:42] life told you and you did that and
[15:44] somebody allowed that to happen then
[15:46] that's just and you somebody come and
[15:47] say hey man you're not supposed to do
[15:49] that well I was
[15:50] ignorant but once you were told right
[15:53] it's not ignorance anymore if you do it
[15:56] again that's
[15:57] iniquity that's knowing to do right and
[15:59] not doing it right all right so you
[16:02] start with the first seal and we see
[16:03] that how he he come
[16:05] in excuse me he come into that first
[16:09] church age let's just kind of take a
[16:11] little a little trip into the first
[16:13] church age because remember what
[16:14] happened in the first age the first
[16:17] church age started with a grown group of
[16:22] people
[16:23] amen everybody understand that say amen
[16:25] amen all right for the ones of you that
[16:27] didn't the church age
[16:30] began right around the day of Pentecost
[16:33] there and then Paul comes in but they
[16:35] were a very mature people right they had
[16:38] come to a place to where that God had
[16:41] been working in their life all the
[16:43] fruits of the spirit all the things
[16:44] working in in the church and then what
[16:47] happened to those
[16:49] people and I kind of wrote it down in
[16:51] the book here a long time ago I'm
[16:54] reading from notes that I did in Jamaica
[16:55] about 6 years ago so I'm kind of pulling
[16:57] things back out of here
[16:59] um to show you though that it goes right
[17:01] along with it
[17:04] because they were Christians by birth in
[17:07] the first age right yeah right right
[17:10] they were
[17:12] persecuted all 11 were killed except for
[17:15] John or 12 were killed except for John
[17:17] all right but then the
[17:21] persecuted they were Christians by birth
[17:24] but then they went to Christians by name
[17:27] and became the persecutors right
[17:30] exactly right amen from the first age
[17:34] right they come right up and they were
[17:37] they were the they were the cream of the
[17:39] crop they were the they were a white
[17:41] righteous Church you couldn't put a
[17:43] finger on their life right but something
[17:46] happened and let something let the bar
[17:49] down let the goats in done something
[17:52] something
[17:53] happened because they started beginning
[17:55] to Satan began to erode or eat eat that
[17:58] fruit of the spirit Up the Love The Joy
[18:00] the peace the longsuffering and all
[18:02] those
[18:03] things they should have known better
[18:07] right that man of sin that mystery of
[18:10] iniquity was starting in a form that
[18:13] they had never seen before
[18:15] right cuz back when they developed it
[18:18] was a bunch of drunks or pores
[18:21] prostitutes all those things then you
[18:23] had the Christian
[18:25] people then Three Ages later you really
[18:28] couldn't tell the
[18:31] difference I hope you're getting
[18:32] something here right could it be
[18:35] happening again because that's the alpha
[18:37] bride and this is the Omega bride we
[18:38] know the alpha bride fell but the Omega
[18:41] bride is not supposed to fall the real
[18:43] bride is not supposed to fall right so
[18:46] we see I I've seen many times that that
[18:49] you look at this first seal and you
[18:51] think well that's it the white horse
[18:53] rider was the Antichrist and and he went
[18:55] riding out and and you know conquering
[18:58] to conquering and he conquered but you
[19:00] know there's a lot more to this yeah now
[19:04] you look through the Bible and you can
[19:05] see even over and let's go over to
[19:08] Genesis and look at Cain and Abel just
[19:11] for a second this has been Ted to you
[19:13] before but if we don't see the seals
[19:15] from Genesis to Revelation then you and
[19:18] I because remember brother brand said it
[19:20] didn't become a brand new chapter right
[19:22] he didn't say it become a brand new
[19:24] chapter in the book he said it became a
[19:26] brand new
[19:28] book right the whole book became new
[19:32] right what you do Brother
[19:35] Anderson you okay yeah okay all right
[19:38] miss him sitting there I just just
[19:39] realized he wasn't there he short as he
[19:43] is Genesis CH
[19:48] 4
[19:51] verse
[19:56] four and able now remember this is the
[19:58] two Spirits this is the two this is the
[20:01] two um good and evil or you know what I
[20:05] don't even like to call it good and evil
[20:06] anymore cuz there's not good and evil
[20:08] anymore
[20:09] right Satan has become so good so
[20:13] there's no good and evil
[20:15] anymore right what is evil drinking
[20:18] smoking gambling cursing doing the
[20:21] things of the world is that what's evil
[20:22] no what's evil is is this man of sin
[20:25] sitting in the temple of God right
[20:28] showing himself to be as God I told him
[20:31] this weekend Brother Richard somebody
[20:33] preaching in a pull pit yeah exactly
[20:37] right black is s on the inside
[20:41] right but
[20:43] somewhere just like in that first
[20:46] age God had power but he gave power to
[20:50] Satan power was given and then what did
[20:53] he do he went forth conquering and to
[20:54] conquer the people let him in cu the
[20:57] people equ what giving them power right
[20:59] all right so watch chapter 4 and Abel he
[21:03] also brought the firstling of the flock
[21:04] and of the fat thereof and the Lord had
[21:06] respect unto
[21:09] Abel and to his
[21:12] offering in other words what Abel
[21:15] had was righteous to God right correct
[21:19] because God had the Lord cap Lord he had
[21:23] respect un Abel and his offering Abel
[21:25] was contacted with God one onone
[21:29] now remember Cain was also contacted
[21:32] with God one onone right right right
[21:36] there was no priest king or Pope in
[21:38] between all
[21:39] those but unto Cain and to his offering
[21:42] he had not respect right and Cain was
[21:44] very wroth and his countenance
[21:47] fell and the Lord said unto Cain why art
[21:50] thou wroth and why is thy count
[21:52] countenance Fallen right in other words
[21:56] why have you left your first love you
[21:58] should be doing like your brother
[22:01] Abel why have you started your own
[22:04] Doctrine oh yeah your own idea your own
[22:08] thought I'm bringing it into the church
[22:10] age but let's bring it up to this age
[22:12] yeah all right because the church ages
[22:14] we know it's kind of easy to say what
[22:15] they did cuz you can see it in the
[22:18] history if thou doest well shal thou not
[22:22] be
[22:23] accepted and if thou dust not well sin
[22:28] lith at the door right and unto thee
[22:31] shall be his desire who sin right and
[22:37] thou shalt rule over him right let's
[22:40] read that again if thou doest
[22:43] well so at that point Cain knew he
[22:48] wasn't doing well right right it was
[22:51] brought to his attention brother Danny
[22:53] he may he may have set all that fruit up
[22:55] and until this point in time he may have
[22:57] thought man I'm okay just God's going to
[22:59] just come in here and just bless me
[23:00] somewhere
[23:03] sometime but when God said if thou doest
[23:06] well and do like your brother Abel
[23:09] exactly you'll be
[23:11] blessed Cain knew then his offering was
[23:14] not good right all right so what
[23:18] happens that lust in abble and Cain's
[23:22] heart cuz it says right here if thou
[23:26] doest not well sin lith at the door and
[23:30] unto thee shall be
[23:32] his what is the definition of lust y
[23:36] desire
[23:38] right his desire and thou shalt rule
[23:42] over him then we see it went further
[23:46] that Cain was talking to Abel many times
[23:48] we've seen this about the about the
[23:50] doctrine but look Abel and Cain were
[23:54] standing Cain was just as righteous as
[23:56] Abel until they come to a point point to
[23:58] where God came on the scene right
[24:01] exactly and said hey this is right and
[24:04] this is wrong same thing within each
[24:06] each of our lives
[24:09] right we may have thought and that's you
[24:11] know Cain and Abel's not what the devil
[24:14] didn't bother me when I was the devil's
[24:16] property
[24:18] you bother me brother Danny I stick a
[24:20] water tobacco in my mouth and it didn't
[24:22] bother me a bit might have bothered you
[24:24] a little but not
[24:26] me
[24:29] but when God came on the scene in my
[24:32] life and started cleaning this old guy
[24:35] up the old desire or the lust was still
[24:38] there for that
[24:41] tobacco God took it
[24:43] away but your body still craved it oh
[24:46] yeah cuz you're human you're a human
[24:48] being same way right here Abel knew he
[24:51] was right that first church age knew
[24:54] they were right they had signs they had
[24:55] wonders they had God working in their
[24:57] Church and in their life and then here
[25:00] come another group of people weaving
[25:02] their way
[25:06] in trying to get what they had Satan's
[25:10] not trying to get something different
[25:12] he's trying to get what you got right
[25:15] cuz if he can get the Holy Ghost he can
[25:17] really do some damage that's right but
[25:19] he
[25:20] can't praise the Lord he
[25:23] can't if he did he'd be your brother
[25:26] right
[25:29] but now in that age you can see this
[25:31] Cain and
[25:32] Abel working in that first age because
[25:36] you had a a part of the age where in 303
[25:39] that n come into being now what happened
[25:42] at n and n of Rome they brought a group
[25:46] of people up they were they were talking
[25:49] about
[25:51] something a
[25:53] discussion now brother Brown said they
[25:55] should have never went right right all
[25:57] right
[25:58] but they went anyway and like brother
[26:01] D's always said I believe that's true
[26:02] even in 606 when they adopted all these
[26:04] things cuz it took 300
[26:06] years the devil is not he don't do
[26:09] things real quick right it was 303 and
[26:12] 606 that's about 300 years all the ones
[26:15] with the 303 is dead yeah
[26:19] gone but their Doctrine lived on right
[26:23] cuz in 606 they instituted the the um
[26:27] the baptism in name the father Son and
[26:29] Holy Ghost and and you know three God or
[26:31] God in three persons and all those
[26:33] things it took 300 years for Satan to
[26:35] weave his way in but once he weaved his
[26:38] way in he had the people
[26:40] amen he was on that horse and you
[26:43] couldn't get him off amen right so he
[26:45] just got off and slid over himself let
[26:48] that white horse go on and he got on a
[26:49] red
[26:50] horse and he started killing conquering
[26:53] more and more we know that's in the
[26:54] second seal but in this first seal let's
[26:57] let's go back let me read something to
[26:59] you
[27:03] here seal of God
[27:06] 1954 let's talk about the Christian for
[27:08] a minute first thing we ought to get
[27:10] settled now is what is the Seal of God
[27:13] don't you think that would be essential
[27:14] is a Bible a good enough word for you
[27:16] now I know you have them that that want
[27:19] to say keeping the Sabbath day but
[27:20] that's not one spec of scripture to
[27:22] support that in the New Testament you
[27:25] see what he's saying somebody else said
[27:26] something else
[27:28] yeah there was another idea out there
[27:31] that if you just keep the Sabbath or if
[27:33] you do this or if you do that see Satan
[27:35] working but watch turn to Ephesians 4:30
[27:38] you don't have to mark it down grieve
[27:41] not the holy spirit of God whereby ye
[27:43] are sealed until the day of your
[27:45] Redemption now what does sealing mean
[27:47] sealing is a sign of completion is that
[27:50] right now Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not
[27:54] the holy spirit of God not the Holy
[27:55] Church of God the holy spirit of God
[27:58] that was the
[27:59] problem they began a holy church in the
[28:02] first age oh yeah left out the holy God
[28:06] right but they put the holy church up in
[28:09] front of the holy God right and then you
[28:11] got the mess that you were in all
[28:14] right cuz to me folks let me just give
[28:17] it to you plain it when I was just kind
[28:20] of going through this sure I saw what
[28:23] was going on at n we were we saw what
[28:25] was going on in the first age we saw
[28:27] what was going on in the people but I
[28:31] see it going on now
[28:34] yeah cuz remember that white horse
[28:36] brother Brown says rides right on into
[28:37] eternity and brother D now we're talking
[28:39] about this other day that's kind of hard
[28:40] to believe right sorry it is cuz Satan's
[28:43] not Eternal but it keeps R he said rides
[28:46] on into eternity what maybe Eternal
[28:48] judgment yeah cuz that's what he's
[28:50] taking the people with him right he's
[28:52] taking them right into Eternal judgment
[28:54] all right not eternal hell but there is
[28:55] an eternal judgment right all right just
[28:58] like there's an eternal Redemption thank
[28:59] God for that
[29:01] amen but grieve not the holy spirit of
[29:04] God whereby you are sealed until the day
[29:05] of your Redemption and a seal represents
[29:07] a finished work nothing is sealed like
[29:10] you seal a boxar and he explains that
[29:12] God comes around and finds a lot of
[29:14] foolishness in us he just don't seal it
[29:16] yet sees a lot of unbelief he just don't
[29:18] seal it yet but when it's all packed up
[29:20] with Full Gospel then he sealed it
[29:22] that's right sealed it till its
[29:24] destination is that wonderful all right
[29:26] now look the people in the first age we
[29:28] know they were sealed away every Church
[29:31] age had a bride that was sealed away in
[29:34] the arms of God in that sixth Dimension
[29:37] and put in
[29:38] there to be resurrected but now there
[29:42] was a system that stayed
[29:45] there a system yeah remember brother R
[29:49] talks about Satan
[29:51] Superman well now I don't look at it as
[29:53] one person yet Brother D cuz it's not
[29:56] one person yet yeah right it will
[29:59] culminate into one person yeah but Satan
[30:03] Superman was a system right A system
[30:06] that came among the people telling them
[30:08] it was okay to do this it was okay to do
[30:10] that it was okay to wear pants it was
[30:12] okay you see that thing coming right on
[30:14] and just riding right on into this
[30:16] church age all
[30:18] right but God wants though to seal a
[30:21] group of people in the end time with
[30:25] these virtues right that the first
[30:28] church a didn't have all the virtues now
[30:30] we know Paul and James and Peter and all
[30:32] those had these virtues working in their
[30:34] life but they didn't have all of them
[30:36] it's like I was telling them last Sun
[30:38] this past Sunday brother
[30:41] Richard this Holy Spirit right here
[30:43] brother brand watch what he says he said
[30:46] in the vision or in the dream remember
[30:48] Sister Shepherd's dream he was somebody
[30:51] was pouring water in the
[30:54] top and what was coming out
[30:57] trash right out of the
[31:02] virtues uhhuh yes sir cuz you're born
[31:06] again right here yeah you born again
[31:09] right here when he was pouring the water
[31:10] in the the dream was that the trash was
[31:13] coming out and running down the side the
[31:15] trash was still coming out in all these
[31:17] virtues being working in their lives
[31:20] they had workings in their lives uh and
[31:22] I want to try to get to something on a
[31:24] coat of many colors uh brother Dale's
[31:26] been speaking of it but this is to me
[31:29] this is Brother Joel this is a coat of
[31:31] many colors
[31:34] right if I saw Joseph's coat and we saw
[31:37] it we can see it in some of the pictures
[31:40] it's what
[31:42] Stripes one color here one color here
[31:45] one color here all right Faith virtue
[31:49] knowledge Temperance patience God
[31:51] brotherly kindness but the Holy Spirit
[31:53] was what was is what in now is holding
[31:56] everything together
[31:58] problem was a lot of these people didn't
[31:59] have all the virtues and power without
[32:02] character is satanic right so a lot of
[32:05] those people went to that nice in
[32:06] Council that were babies yeah oh yeah
[32:09] and got caught up into the what do you
[32:12] want to say the Limelight or got caught
[32:14] up into a new doctrine or a new thing
[32:16] look at the people in the
[32:18] message some new doctrine comes out
[32:20] they'll just get caught up and they just
[32:21] their their eyes is blinded yeah it's
[32:25] that same spirit that caught them in the
[32:26] first church
[32:27] right amen that thing's not dead people
[32:29] that thing's More Alive now because it's
[32:31] got more power right power was given to
[32:35] Satan but where does that power come
[32:36] from the people right comes from you and
[32:41] I if we don't have hey we still got
[32:45] trash we still got trash even right here
[32:48] we got trash right cuz you don't just
[32:51] get virtue and then you don't get
[32:54] anymore knowledge you get you brother
[32:57] yeah you got if you're right here B you
[32:59] got it all no these lines are just for
[33:01] us human beings to realize that it's a
[33:03] steep stepping stone right but if you
[33:07] could if you could paint that brother
[33:09] boy it'd be virtue and and virtue would
[33:11] weave all the way up to the top
[33:13] knowledge would weave all the way up to
[33:15] the top because you don't just get
[33:16] knowledge and then that's it
[33:18] right you don't get patience and that's
[33:20] it right believe you me I remember today
[33:24] about 25 times I had to have patience
[33:27] M so I didn't just get patience I you
[33:30] got keep getting patience right and I
[33:33] promise you you see this one right
[33:35] here Temperance will sure do a lot with
[33:38] a lot of us with patience
[33:42] right but what am I trying to say the
[33:45] same spirit that was working in
[33:48] those in those people in the first
[33:51] church age Faith virtue knowledge temper
[33:53] fa because they had the divine nature of
[33:55] God right Peter James Paul that's where
[33:56] you get to B all right now that comes to
[34:00] to n and and the pommer worm starts
[34:04] eating those fruits away when he starts
[34:07] eating those fruits away they start
[34:08] going we need something
[34:11] new we need something new a new doctrine
[34:14] we need a new way we need um U now now
[34:18] Kan if you'll do well but now Kane's
[34:22] going if I My Brother's Keeper M right
[34:25] in other words if I got to do my sister
[34:28] have I got to do like my
[34:30] brother who are you to tell
[34:33] me what I got to do right well if God's
[34:36] working in brother Dick's life I need to
[34:37] be acting like brother dick right not
[34:40] the human part but the the part that the
[34:43] virtue is Flowing
[34:45] from but you and I I'm not saying that
[34:49] funny I meant
[34:51] that we have a we have a a human part of
[34:54] temperance though that we don't want
[34:56] exactly
[34:57] right brother boy he over shaking he's
[34:59] beating his head against
[35:01] yeah but that's not human
[35:05] virtues if you born with the divine
[35:08] nature of God you have those virtues
[35:10] working in your life and they're not
[35:12] human they're divine right that's why I
[35:15] say that that Supernatural Fellowship
[35:18] has been open I can see more of this as
[35:20] being a supernatural patience yeah you
[35:23] think supernatural patience God had
[35:25] supernatural patience for you didn't he
[35:27] right amen it was Supernatural because
[35:30] most of us don't have enough patience
[35:31] for each other right right it was
[35:34] Supernatural right that patience I don't
[35:36] know why I'm getting off on this but
[35:38] supernatural patience
[35:40] Supernatural
[35:43] Temperance Jesus was pretty Supernatural
[35:45] wasn't he
[35:46] right he he he uh drove some people out
[35:50] of it yeah out of a church one
[35:53] time that was U yet premeditated he
[35:56] platted the ropes and I don't believe
[35:57] the Rope was this long
[36:00] either you ever try to I've platted
[36:02] June's hair and it's about this long and
[36:04] it sure takes a while I bet he was
[36:05] standing there plating figuring out what
[36:07] he was going to do but you know what
[36:10] that's an example for you and
[36:13] I that's
[36:15] Supernatural
[36:17] Temperance you ever thought about that
[36:20] those verses are
[36:21] Supernatural right now were they so much
[36:26] excuse me in the first church age that
[36:29] they had all the gifts working they had
[36:30] all the things in their life they had
[36:32] brotherly kindness they had godliness
[36:33] they had those things but what was
[36:35] different from them and
[36:37] us that white righteous church
[36:41] called n you can call it Rome whatever
[36:44] but to me Rome is just a name it's like
[36:46] cancer cancer is just a name okay it's
[36:50] mystery babon it's it's the mother
[36:52] it's the things that we know that it is
[36:54] but the world calls it Catholicism M or
[36:57] or romanism or whatever but remember
[36:59] romanism became
[37:02] what became Catholicism right during
[37:05] this time of this of this first seal
[37:08] opening where this white horse rider
[37:09] went riding
[37:11] out and riding out where was he riding
[37:14] he was riding in a group of people amen
[37:17] right he wasn't riding out uh you know
[37:20] in a group of drunks no he was in the
[37:22] church
[37:24] right he wanted to be in church
[37:27] right amen Satan loves to go to church
[37:30] right cuz he gets in your mind and he
[37:32] plays he plays in mine so I know he
[37:35] plays in
[37:40] yours but this
[37:45] Fellowship our
[37:47] fellowship with
[37:50] God became so real in a little
[37:53] Prophet till he said here stands a lamb
[37:55] with a book in his hand man and there
[37:57] goes the white horse rider in opposition
[38:00] he was it was the um
[38:04] doctrine that he had had all those years
[38:08] 1958 he preached a mighty conqueror and
[38:10] he preached Revelation 6 verse1 and two
[38:14] all
[38:15] right and we know for a fact that that
[38:18] was because brother brandham didn't know
[38:20] any different
[38:22] right God didn't reveal everything to
[38:24] the prophet but when he he brought him
[38:26] to this one
[38:27] week of Supernatural Fellowship oh if
[38:32] that angel had not come into the room
[38:35] that angel had visited him for a long a
[38:37] lot of times
[38:39] before but what about this angel coming
[38:41] into the room right and telling him that
[38:45] hey that thing riding in you is the same
[38:47] thing that
[38:49] started come on people that started back
[38:53] in that first age right cuz remember he
[38:56] said he had to preach Church ages he had
[38:58] to preach Daniel 70 week get all that in
[39:01] order he says out of the way but out of
[39:03] the way to me means in order right amen
[39:07] I mean he didn't have to a lot of people
[39:08] say oh he just got them out of the way
[39:09] brother D no he put them in order right
[39:12] he put them in order so you and I could
[39:14] understand what the church agees
[39:16] paralleled with in Daniel 70 weeks it's
[39:18] all Redemption redemption in the seals
[39:20] is redemption so it's all Redemption
[39:22] right right but he to open Supernatural
[39:25] Fellowship you got to expose the bad in
[39:28] your
[39:29] life because you can't have Supernatural
[39:31] fellowship with a holy God brother R
[39:34] said you can't do that right remember
[39:37] that time he told the little white
[39:40] lie he was born again yeah I'd say he
[39:43] had some of the virtues working his life
[39:45] wouldn't you and he told a little little
[39:47] white
[39:48] lie when he went to pray for a baby God
[39:52] said take your dirty hands right dirty
[39:57] off of that
[39:58] baby go make this right what about you
[40:02] and I right what about you and I
[40:05] especially when we come into church and
[40:08] we want to get something from God yeah
[40:10] and we got everything in the world on
[40:11] our mind right right um we we hinder a
[40:15] lot of people being prayed for because
[40:17] of our attitude
[40:19] yeah okay we all do all do that's why if
[40:23] you want to pray if you want to see
[40:25] something happen pray that God take all
[40:26] the stuff out of your life first
[40:31] amen come on let's get down now we're
[40:33] going to get down into our life amen cuz
[40:35] I believe when Paul was preaching he
[40:37] preached to those Corinthians he got
[40:39] down to where they lived Glory right he
[40:43] said it's not lawful for you to have
[40:44] your mother-in-law you can't do this you
[40:47] shouldn't be doing that you shouldn't be
[40:48] doing this right right so let's just get
[40:51] down to bare facts why do we not get
[40:54] receive our healing why do we not not
[40:56] receive I I I pray all the time for our
[40:59] for every person in this building to to
[41:01] just be filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[41:03] have the new birth right kids right on
[41:06] up to adults doesn't matter Glory okay
[41:10] right why doesn't it
[41:13] happen my sins and your sins what
[41:16] brother Ram said unconfessed sins right
[41:20] so when someone comes up for
[41:22] prayer first thing I say is God you've
[41:24] heard me say this before but someone you
[41:26] I say God do not let my life or what I'm
[41:31] thinking stand in the way of that person
[41:33] get healed because see that person has
[41:35] to have personal
[41:37] faith that person's got to have a
[41:39] personal faith when he come he or she
[41:41] comes up here he has personal faith
[41:43] brother brand said I'm not operating
[41:44] this gift right you're operating this
[41:47] gift
[41:48] amen I was reading it yesterday or day
[41:50] before yesterday one where he was he
[41:52] said you're just pulling right and left
[41:54] he told a man to sit down he said sir
[41:56] would you sit down or the next time in
[41:58] other words he said the next time he
[41:59] said let whatever it is be on your head
[42:02] why because they were moving through
[42:03] people it was Spirit yeah and you can
[42:05] feel them up here you feel them back
[42:08] there right but what are we going to
[42:11] let's look at this thing right here just
[42:12] for a second we're not going to be
[42:17] long what should we be looking
[42:20] for in the steps of the way of our of
[42:25] our progressing right sister Anna um the
[42:29] way that we progress you look at that
[42:30] first church age and you see that that
[42:32] they didn't so much and God forgive me
[42:35] if I'm wrong they didn't so much as
[42:37] progress they regress
[42:39] right right yeah Paul said Grievous
[42:42] wolves is going to come in oh yeah what
[42:44] did Jude say let's go back to the faith
[42:49] that was once delivered to the Saints
[42:51] right amen we've lost our first love so
[42:54] in Revelation says amen
[42:57] they didn't go from from from from being
[43:00] a powerful Church to being a more
[43:02] powerful church right they regress
[43:05] instead of progress right now you and I
[43:08] can't we don't have that hope there's
[43:09] not another age brother Mark there's not
[43:12] another day that you and I can throw
[43:14] this off on another group of people
[43:17] right we can't say oh we can't
[43:19] understand a seal so maybe the new guys
[43:21] are going to come up and bring it to us
[43:24] we can't do that right right the Bible
[43:27] says today is the day of your salvation
[43:29] amen today is the day for you and I to
[43:33] understand the Bible says the mysteries
[43:36] of
[43:37] God be revealed to me and
[43:40] you the mysteries of God didn't say that
[43:44] in the first age it says You and I the
[43:46] mysteries of God be revealed when that
[43:48] seventh angel sound the Myster of God
[43:50] will be
[43:51] finished and then John takes the book
[43:54] out of the Angel's hand the Angel didn't
[43:56] take the book out of the Angel's
[43:58] hand John on top of you and I the bride
[44:02] took that
[44:03] book what brother Brom say the lamb took
[44:06] the book right sat down on the
[44:11] throne open the book
[44:14] right
[44:17] amen what's our
[44:20] problem we shut it back we don't like
[44:22] what it says right we open up this page
[44:25] we shut it back we don't like what it
[44:27] says we open up this page shut it back
[44:30] we don't like what it says
[44:32] right power was given sure power was
[44:36] given to you and I but now
[44:42] listen those things in that church age
[44:45] became just as sayings right there was
[44:48] no head there was no there was no Pope
[44:52] yet Constantine was was ruled
[44:57] and Satan was working and doing the
[44:59] things that he was trying to do there
[45:00] was not a man there yet remember the
[45:02] crown Crown was given right to somebody
[45:06] and brother Brown said you can't Crown
[45:07] spirit that spirit is what was working
[45:09] in that first church age like I said it
[45:11] wasn't Satan Superman it was it was
[45:13] Satan's system it was the system he was
[45:16] working under not a system of more
[45:18] pornography of more this and more that
[45:20] no it was a program
[45:24] right of more do
[45:29] ideas maybe some things that never been
[45:31] heard before let me tell you something I
[45:33] was telling them up at Brother
[45:35] Richard we cannot plead ignorance right
[45:40] right today
[45:43] right they complete ignorance in that
[45:45] first church on certain things because
[45:49] certain things are not been made known
[45:50] the light had not Shone on certain
[45:52] things like it is now but you and I we
[45:54] can't do that right we can't plead
[45:56] ignorance and say Lord well I didn't
[45:58] know that so now what are you and I
[46:00] supposed to
[46:04] do I believe one thing's for sure God
[46:08] has a white righteous group of people
[46:10] amen that started in the first Age come
[46:13] on and if you can say it you got more
[46:16] white y because more has been revealed
[46:20] to us more has been made known we know
[46:23] we should know how to act amen we should
[46:26] know how to treat our brothers we should
[46:28] know how to treat our sisters and not be
[46:32] brother Brown said the other day I was
[46:33] reading he said this was not done in a
[46:37] corner his whole message everything he
[46:40] done all the healing campaigns he said
[46:42] this was not done in hiding that's right
[46:44] he said this is in plain view right of
[46:47] the world Amen now as the mystery of
[46:51] iniquity is a mystery and that that man
[46:54] of sin hides his
[46:57] so God is hiding you and I right a group
[47:00] of
[47:02] people that looks like just maybe an
[47:04] outscout rag tag group of
[47:07] people remember
[47:09] Samson I like Samson cuz Samson did not
[47:13] look like Arnold spener right Samson
[47:16] looked like Don knot oh
[47:19] my with seven little curls hanging down
[47:22] his
[47:23] neck but brother R said I was reading
[47:26] yesterday brother Brown said said said
[47:28] Samson walked up to those Gates of that
[47:30] City and said all he done he just
[47:32] reached back and he felt those locked
[47:35] right and that little shrimp picked up 2
[47:38] and 1/2 tons each of gate and picks him
[47:42] up why do you think the Philistines was
[47:43] running around trying to get his trying
[47:44] to get where his strength was if he
[47:46] looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger they
[47:48] knew where he got his strength from but
[47:49] they found a little rag tag boy a man
[47:52] running around with seven curls on his
[47:54] in his in his head
[47:56] same way with you and
[47:59] I we look like when we're weak we look
[48:02] like that we don't have anything going
[48:04] on we look like but God's hiding
[48:07] himself glory in a group of people in
[48:10] the end time more than he's ever cuz
[48:12] he's going to have to hide
[48:14] us we can't hide oursel he's going to
[48:16] have to hide us and let me tell you
[48:19] something death going to hide a lot of
[48:21] us right death h brother Tom right cuz I
[48:26] say before remember we was talking about
[48:27] downstairs he was planted in corruption
[48:30] but he'll never come back in corruption
[48:32] he'll come back Incorruptible because he
[48:35] went down in corruption what his mom and
[48:37] daddy gave him but he's not going to
[48:38] come back in corruption anymore right I
[48:41] told you and I said when they shut that
[48:42] casket I said you'll never see that man
[48:45] right there again that's right you've
[48:46] known him all these years but you'll
[48:48] never see that guy right there you'll
[48:50] see that 18y old man but you'll never
[48:52] see that old guy again cuz that's what
[48:54] Mom and Daddy for is
[48:56] right that's what you and I have that
[48:59] this first age did not have right is a
[49:02] revelation that we're going to the end
[49:04] not going down we're going up
[49:09] right you believe that that's
[49:12] amen that's exactly what's
[49:16] happening but be
[49:18] careful because in Matthew 24 we'll be
[49:22] finished in just a second not very long
[49:24] turn to Matthew
[49:26] 24 look at
[49:32] verse but if you really you can really
[49:34] see the
[49:38] character of those seals remember the
[49:40] first seal was the lion right went out
[49:42] with the boldness of the lion amen l i o
[49:44] n not ly Li
[49:47] lion and they were
[49:50] bold but Jesus comes to Matthew 24 and
[49:53] he tells them he preaches the seals he
[49:55] he he shows them he says take heed that
[49:57] no man deceive you though he starts off
[49:59] pretty pretty pretty bold don't let
[50:01] anyone deceive you right here's the
[50:05] deception for many shall come many not
[50:09] one or two brother de
[50:12] many in that first age they just flooded
[50:15] in that second age they just flooded
[50:17] those people with with the doctrine of
[50:19] of the Catholic Church beginning of the
[50:21] Catholic church but it flooded them it
[50:23] it just over it just overrun them
[50:25] right cuz that horse had a lot of power
[50:28] amen and a horse without somebody
[50:31] guiding it he going to run over you yeah
[50:35] all right that's what happened but
[50:37] watch for many shall come in my name
[50:40] saying I am Christ right and shall
[50:43] deceive many
[50:45] amen
[50:48] many
[50:50] millions billions amen not deceived by
[50:57] good and evil yeah we should know
[51:01] evil right remember the Bible says shun
[51:04] the appearance of
[51:06] evil but what does lust do what does
[51:09] what does the innocence of lust do if
[51:12] you were to try go and try to commit
[51:14] adultery on your wife or your husband
[51:16] what's the first thing lust does it
[51:18] draws you away from your partner yeah
[51:21] right right amen and that's exactly what
[51:23] Satan wants to do he wants to draw you
[51:25] away from your partner amen cuz if he
[51:27] can draw you away from your partner then
[51:30] he can get in and he get in this thing
[51:31] right here and then what happen to this
[51:33] right here it acts out in the rest of
[51:36] this okay that's things that we have to
[51:38] look for children are not uh children or
[51:41] are children in the Lord the same way
[51:43] but God
[51:46] began Pentecost in the day of Pentecost
[51:49] he began riding through the ages
[51:51] starting with a lion right roaring out
[51:54] what was he doing now look look they
[51:56] were the
[51:58] original they were the elect for the day
[52:00] there's no there's no question about
[52:03] that they were the elect lady for the
[52:06] day right but they weren't the complete
[52:09] lady
[52:10] right they were a
[52:13] bride the
[52:15] original brother called Paul the
[52:17] original everything that come out of
[52:18] that first church AG was original Fai of
[52:21] the fathers exactly they kept the name
[52:23] alive they kept water baptism alive as
[52:25] long as they could they kept they kept
[52:27] the deity of Jesus Christ but going into
[52:29] that next age or going into actually the
[52:31] pergam age about 606 what happened Satan
[52:35] began to eat that word down oh yeah he
[52:38] began to erode
[52:40] it you can't kill the word of God right
[52:45] but you can kill the effects of it
[52:48] word's always there right the word was
[52:51] there in power in the first church age
[52:54] true but but what happened they let a
[52:57] group of people get in and start
[52:59] separating
[53:01] us from our mate yeah when lust is
[53:05] conceived it brings forth sin and sin
[53:08] when it's finished if you stop any of
[53:11] those spots though it's not so bad let
[53:14] me let me just be plain lust is not bad
[53:16] if you don't let it go so far you
[53:20] understand what I'm saying I mean we
[53:21] lust after cars and we lust after this
[53:23] it ain't just lust after women or men
[53:25] we lust after things right what it's
[53:28] Look up the word lust it's a desire for
[53:31] something okay it's a desire to do
[53:34] something or a desire uh you know we we
[53:37] we have a desire to to come to church
[53:40] that's not a lust but it starting in an
[53:42] innocent in
[53:45] innocence Satan was sitting in the same
[53:48] seat with the
[53:50] righteous yeah real
[53:54] close he he's your closest friend yeah
[53:57] if you let
[54:01] him but these people for many shall come
[54:04] in my name and say I am Christ and shall
[54:06] deceive many now watch what happened in
[54:08] the first age and we'll finish right
[54:10] here in the first
[54:11] age they had the deity of Jesus Christ
[54:14] correct because it was one God they knew
[54:15] that right all right they knew Jesus
[54:17] Christ was almighty God they didn't you
[54:18] didn't have to go and and sit down and
[54:21] and read a book about it they knew that
[54:24] water baptism the name of Lord Jesus
[54:25] Christ they had that that was that was
[54:28] ingrained in their mind all right but
[54:31] they started falling away from the
[54:33] things in that
[54:37] age little
[54:39] sayings oh yeah little things that came
[54:43] out that maybe shouldn't have come
[54:47] out listen to
[54:52] this this is what's going to be made no
[54:55] what third seal 1963 tried to find it in
[54:58] the first seal but I couldn't find it so
[55:00] but brother R if you'll read the seal
[55:01] book he goes back and and reviews the
[55:03] seal before and sometimes he'll pick up
[55:05] the seal before that right right read
[55:08] that seal book as a everything laps over
[55:10] itself just like he said to laugh over
[55:12] the church ages and and you know to
[55:14] laugh over these seals they laugh over
[55:17] each other it's it's a book right right
[55:20] remember I told you I said when when
[55:21] brother Bram the most important seal is
[55:23] that first seal because when that first
[55:24] seal open when he tore that first seal
[55:27] off it opened the book right it opened
[55:31] this book so that the second seal could
[55:33] open right everybody understand that say
[55:36] Amen right they had to it's the first
[55:39] seal if that thing was still sealed up
[55:41] right here I don't care if there's
[55:42] 100,000 seals in there but when that
[55:45] first seal was
[55:47] open it became brand new book right amen
[55:52] not a chapter not a verse it became
[55:54] brand new new book Glory when it become
[55:57] a brand new
[55:59] book
[56:02] listen third seal now Lamb's got the
[56:05] book in his hand breaking the seal broke
[56:07] the first one second one and now he
[56:08] breaks the third one and as he breaks it
[56:11] the lamb breaks it the third seal the
[56:12] third Beast now how many knows what the
[56:14] third Beast look like look like a man
[56:16] the first one looked like a lion the
[56:19] other one cine o and the third one look
[56:21] like a man as a man and as he heard the
[56:24] living creature that the Beast living
[56:25] creatures like a man said to John come
[56:29] see what it is this mystery that's been
[56:32] hi
[56:35] right now John types the
[56:38] bride right right that lion Spirit lion
[56:42] lion not lying lion spirit said come and
[56:46] see in other words step into this part
[56:49] of the vision with me amen okay cuz that
[56:53] was the Bold part of the line he John
[56:55] was the bride the bride for that AG step
[56:56] into it come and
[56:58] see in other words come and see what's
[57:00] going on Amen all
[57:02] right all down through the years of
[57:05] redemption since the foundation of the
[57:08] world it's been hid under this seal
[57:12] what's going to happen now come look
[57:14] what it is so he opens it up a thunder
[57:16] blast and the lamb opens the
[57:22] seal that's what happened the line the
[57:25] first seal Thunder blast seal was
[57:28] open now brother bram's talking here
[57:31] about ceiling being a sign of
[57:33] completion oh yeah now in the other part
[57:37] he's saying that it's something
[57:40] open but now watch him with the Box Car
[57:44] the box car is filled with things that
[57:46] are set in their right place right
[57:49] packed in there he
[57:50] said let me make an example packed in
[57:53] there he said oh yeah so they don't
[57:56] shake right amen then what does he do
[57:59] puts a seal on it then when whoever
[58:02] breaks that seal what do they
[58:05] get they get what's inside the box right
[58:08] amen that's the same thing happened with
[58:10] the seals when the seals open we got
[58:11] what was inside the box right right God
[58:15] had packed this thing full before the
[58:18] foundation of the world he said right
[58:19] here all through the years of redemption
[58:22] years of redemption
[58:26] Redemption started at Calvary I don't
[58:27] think so Redemption started before the
[58:29] foundation of the world
[58:31] right cuz that's when the lamb was
[58:33] really slain amen right that's so
[58:36] Redemption started before the foundation
[58:38] of the world before this thing right
[58:39] here was ever written right right that's
[58:42] right and then when that first seal open
[58:45] that give us an
[58:47] opportunity to not just be
[58:49] redeemed in our sub because the first
[58:53] church age and the second Church age in
[58:54] the Third Church AG in the fourth Church
[58:56] AG in the fifth they were all redeemed
[58:57] in their soul right am I
[58:59] correct but when that Prophet stood
[59:02] there and literally opened this thing up
[59:04] to us
[59:07] right it didn't just become a brand new
[59:09] book to him right come on it became a
[59:11] brand new book to Dick Addison cuz dick
[59:14] Addison couldn't find his name in the
[59:16] book with a cover like this right you
[59:18] can't find your name in the book with
[59:21] the book closed right you got to have
[59:23] the book open
[59:25] Paul found his name John found his name
[59:27] magicians come we all have looked down
[59:29] Through the
[59:30] Ages trying to find our name
[59:35] right but the difference in that first
[59:38] age and this age there was scripture in
[59:41] between that had to be fulfilled true
[59:43] right amen there was a time when
[59:45] scripture had to be fulfilled it wasn't
[59:47] time in the first Daye right right cuz
[59:49] brother brandham said he even said
[59:53] that if the Bible had not
[59:57] said that those four Angels hold the
[1:00:01] Four Winds I was just reading it back
[1:00:03] there just now that the battle of
[1:00:04] Armageddon would have started at the
[1:00:06] first world war sure but one
[1:00:10] scripture held all that back right amen
[1:00:14] you ever read that I pulled it up on a
[1:00:16] quote just just a few minutes ago I
[1:00:18] never read it
[1:00:19] before but the they hold the Four Winds
[1:00:22] or the four Wars yeah brother Brown said
[1:00:25] if that scripture had not been there the
[1:00:26] battle of Armageddon would have started
[1:00:29] after the first world
[1:00:32] war scripture is very powerful right so
[1:00:36] the first church age didn't have
[1:00:38] Revelations 10:7 right they didn't have
[1:00:41] Revelation 10:7 there was a mystery to
[1:00:44] be revealed in their age and in their
[1:00:46] time right but when the seventh angel
[1:00:49] begins to sound his
[1:00:50] message which brother bandam said his
[1:00:53] message began in the what
[1:00:55] seals seals amen right when he begins to
[1:00:58] sound that
[1:01:00] message then let me paraphrase it
[1:01:02] anything can happen right anything can
[1:01:06] happen because all the scriptures
[1:01:09] started one just dropped in line right
[1:01:11] with the other one dropped in line right
[1:01:13] with the other the only problem with the
[1:01:15] difference in what when brother Brandon
[1:01:17] was standing there on that first seal
[1:01:19] and today is you and I weren't there
[1:01:21] right if you and I are predestinated to
[1:01:24] make this Rapture if you and I are
[1:01:26] predestinated to make a body chain some
[1:01:28] of us were not even born in
[1:01:32] 1963 so it couldn't happen right but see
[1:01:36] once you get all the players on the
[1:01:38] field it can happen exactly and I
[1:01:41] believe Brother Gary all the players are
[1:01:42] on the field brother dick I don't think
[1:01:45] there's another generation let stand I
[1:01:46] don't think there's another
[1:01:49] time but in that first age that
[1:01:53] first spirit that went out was an
[1:01:56] antichrist Spirit it was against the
[1:01:58] word of God yet it was so close amen it
[1:02:01] rode almost right on
[1:02:03] top of that first those first three ages
[1:02:06] where the pure word came about now what
[1:02:07] about in the end time right last
[1:02:12] thing
[1:02:14] low Matthew 24 low he's over
[1:02:20] here Christ is over on the other side of
[1:02:23] the desert that's what the Bible
[1:02:26] say the Bible says go not there right
[1:02:30] right Christ Christ is over there go not
[1:02:35] there right right cuz if you don't
[1:02:38] believe he's in here
[1:02:41] right you'll know whether to go there or
[1:02:43] not
[1:02:45] right you'll know what to do there's
[1:02:48] your mystery of iniquity because
[1:02:50] remember you know better and you do it
[1:02:52] anyway but if you know better and don't
[1:02:54] do it greater is he right that can do
[1:02:57] the
[1:02:59] Commandments than those that remember
[1:03:02] the Rich Young Ruler he he took some of
[1:03:04] the
[1:03:05] Commandments he said I've been this way
[1:03:07] since my youth Jesus said sell
[1:03:10] everything you got in other words sell
[1:03:13] out right and follow me exactly and it
[1:03:16] didn't happen he wouldn't do it he
[1:03:19] lifted up his eyes in hell that was the
[1:03:20] difference in that man there's probably
[1:03:22] a lot of Sinners that went to heaven and
[1:03:24] that man that looked like he was going
[1:03:25] to make it to Heaven oh yeah he went to
[1:03:27] hell right but those same spirits that
[1:03:30] were in Jesus's time come over into
[1:03:32] Paul's time didn't die brother B I was
[1:03:35] reading this morning he said everybody
[1:03:37] close your eyes he said there's a deaf
[1:03:39] spirit in here and he said that spirit
[1:03:41] will go

[1:09:17] man not something
[1:09:19] different and he didn't pack it up the
[1:09:22] doctors packed it
[1:09:24] for a
[1:09:25] while not now I think about the other
[1:09:29] day
[1:09:30] about
[1:09:32] healing healing is potential body change
[1:09:37] amen potential body change one
[1:09:41] day if Lazarus would have c a revelation
[1:09:43] of what happened to him he never died
[1:09:45] again but it wasn't his time it's our
[1:09:49] time it's time for me and you to realize
[1:09:53] that we God heals something he don't
[1:09:55] just patch it
[1:09:58] up he doesn't patch it
[1:10:02] up you think of all those grows and
[1:10:04] tumors and brother R called those things
[1:10:07] and said go away from these
[1:10:10] people what happened amen what's a
[1:10:14] cancer
[1:10:15] cell right it's a cell that's been
[1:10:17] bruised right right a bruised cell when
[1:10:21] brother Brenham would talk to those
[1:10:23] people and say tell that evil spirit to
[1:10:24] leave we know what happened if it was a
[1:10:26] growth or something and fall off or
[1:10:27] whatever but what happened that death he
[1:10:31] told that one this morning he told he
[1:10:33] said that you deaf Spirit leave that
[1:10:37] woman and he talked about one time said
[1:10:39] that say that a devil would bind a nerve
[1:10:42] in your ear
[1:10:43] yeah you think oh this is all medical no
[1:10:47] it's not all medical
[1:10:49] right it's the good and evil we just
[1:10:51] talked about right amen right
[1:10:54] Satan has took a part of you that was
[1:10:56] weak in your body not you as a person
[1:10:58] but in your body a bruised cell right
[1:11:01] but when brother R and pronounced that
[1:11:02] thing gone what happened yeah that cell
[1:11:06] wasn't bruised anymore right it was
[1:11:10] changed Amen in a
[1:11:14] moment in the twinkling of an
[1:11:16] eye cuz brother R said I saw guarders
[1:11:19] fall off right on right in front of me
[1:11:20] on the platform what happened they were
[1:11:22] chained right in the moment potential
[1:11:25] now not full but potential right
[1:11:28] potential body change right
[1:11:31] amen we got to understand
[1:11:34] healing if we understand healing maybe
[1:11:37] we need to preach on that a little bit
[1:11:38] if we understood healing we understand
[1:11:41] more about Resurrection cuz brother Tom
[1:11:43] when he comes back up he's not going to
[1:11:45] have that plate in his leg he's not
[1:11:47] going to have he's not going to have a
[1:11:48] scar on him
[1:11:52] why coach is come right it's been what
[1:11:56] what' you say healed
[1:11:58] amen in a moment that twinking of an eye
[1:12:02] right let's bow our head dear heavenly
[1:12:04] father thank you Lord for giving us the
[1:12:07] time Lord to fellowship with you and to
[1:12:08] fellowship with your people you know
[1:12:10] father how I love to speak about you in
[1:12:12] front of people Lord because I want to
[1:12:13] see you living their life Lord though we
[1:12:17] be a Cast Away Lord I pray that you
[1:12:18] would take and touch somebody's life by
[1:12:21] what's been said Lord that that we truly
[1:12:23] did touch the mind of God tonight that
[1:12:25] that we had Supernatural fellowship with
[1:12:27] you Lord and may we realize that we can
[1:12:30] have more Supernatural Fellowship you're
[1:12:32] not a God that that that binds Lord
[1:12:34] you're a God that frees you're a God
[1:12:36] that gives Deliverance you're a God that
[1:12:38] gives healing and and salvation to the
[1:12:41] soul father how much more should we
[1:12:44] realize that standing in this end time
[1:12:47] we are a blessed group of people Glory a
[1:12:50] group of people that even Paul
[1:12:54] Paul would probably even as Peter said
[1:12:56] about Paul Paul says things hard to be
[1:13:00] understood well maybe Paul would sit in
[1:13:02] the service and say wow brother Dale
[1:13:05] says things hard to be understood
[1:13:07] because Lord we progressed you
[1:13:09] progressed us in a way that you have
[1:13:11] revealed yourself you actually brought
[1:13:13] them your mind right down to a little
[1:13:15] prophet and then through the mind of
[1:13:18] that Prophet you brought it down to word
[1:13:21] so that we as people could understand
[1:13:23] the most a literate person can
[1:13:24] understand this gospel but that Prophet
[1:13:27] brought that word so pure and
[1:13:28] unadulterated but father it wasn't just
[1:13:31] the man it was the Holy Spirit Christ
[1:13:34] the one that brought it down to us Lord
[1:13:36] and you said you would come and abide
[1:13:38] and live in us and that you would teach

[1:13:50] natural body and even in their spiritual
[1:13:52] body their spiritual life I pray right
[1:13:53] now Lord that you would just come down
[1:13:55] and touch them Father make a change Lord
[1:13:58] we we know for a fact that the change is
[1:14:01] already in motion cuz you've changed us
[1:14:03] Lord from a sinner to a saint but father
[1:14:07] we are now looking to Wi to understand
[1:14:09] the Redemption of this body that you
[1:14:11] sent a little Prophet On In the End Time
[1:14:13] Lord you said the son of righteousness
[1:14:15] would rise with healing in his wings and
[1:14:17] Lord you sent a healing Campaign which
[1:14:19] give people a temporary Resurrection it
[1:14:21] raised them up Lord from arthritis and
[1:14:24] cancer and and my the things that we
[1:14:27] could set and read that your Prophet
[1:14:29] went through Lord but we know one
[1:14:31] thing's for sure you have not left the
[1:14:33] scene yes Lord we know one thing's for
[1:14:35] sure that you didn't stop when the
[1:14:37] prophet left the scene Lord that you're
[1:14:39] working now in a group of people and not
[1:14:41] just to heal our body in a temporary
[1:14:43] Resurrection but father you're healing
[1:14:44] our body for a spiritual time that we
[1:14:47] will not ever ever have to be sick again
[1:14:50] that will'll never have a thing in our
[1:14:51] body that will that will afflict us Lord
[1:14:53] Lord and will not be tired and weary but
