bring your books are gonna bring your have you bring the statue of a perfect man book but i think we'll just read it off of here if that's all right with y'all you can put notes in it you bring your book yeah you can put notes in if you want to bring your book but um what we're gonna do is today is i'm going to read this we're going to read a few things that brother brown talks about the statue of a perfect man and then we're going to start on the foundation of faith you'll notice live me a sermon you see that right there what that look like okay that's what we're heading toward all right we're going to read what the prophet said about it but everybody turn your bibles to second peter one and we'll uh get what the prophet said now i want to thank susan and donny for giving me this this is not a ipad but it's close enough it's good enough for me because i use it with all the sermons and everything i need they joe and some of the brothers put all the sermons that i preached with all the notes on the in this computer so if i go out wherever preaching i can read it off here but i can also print it off and have it in my hands so it makes it a lot easier oh well i'm sorry but uh i don't like a preacher like he's reading it off with a book well you won't ever find me itself down here scrolling i won't do that up in the pulpit because i get out from the pulpit i have to carry this with me all the time you know you see some of them preachers they i don't know how they're going to get like brother gilforney could never use well he'd break it before he can get started he wouldn't even bother he would yeah he'd have 14 or 15 of right so now let's read let's read it out of the bible and then we'll let the prophet read so we're going to start on the statue of a perfect man simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained that word obtained there means entrance the word obtained there means influence so there's an in something that we've entered into and you'll read here we'll let the prophet paraphrase down through here but let's read it according to the scripture first to them that have obtained light precious faith so in other words paul peter's saying you've obtained the same faith i have and peter got his on the day of pentecost right now what was different in peter and then the 3000 the 120 in the upper room they walked with they walked with the virtue himself they walked with jesus christ for three and a half years everything he said sure it was a mystery to most of them sure it's a mystery to most of us even in our walk with god but he planted that in him and then when the holy ghost fell on him it quickened because that's what he said he said when i come i'll quicken what you've heard and show you things to come all right so peter could write this because peter was in this position of having the virtues working in his life like i said last sunday peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have what do you have faith virtue knowledge temper faces god as well and kindness all right and he had a certain part of love let's go put that out and say he didn't have any level he had a certain part of the capstone ministry but he didn't have the fullness or the apex or the adoption part of what brother brown was going to show us that's why brother ram had to come and preach the statue of a perfect man in 1962 to bring us back to the faith of the fathers then he could open the seal that's what i'm saying we we can have a knowledge of the seals and we can have an understanding of the seals and we can listen to brother dale like he said oral robbers has got a copy of the seal we can read it in the book but see we've got to be where these six virtues one two three four five six seven virtues i mean are working in our life then the seals can really be open if we're just floundering around down here within your earth yeah we can have a part of of the seal but it's just that's just reading the book i read the sailboat to show you that the white horse writers the antichrist because that's what the prophet said right right but having these virtues working in our life really shows us who that antichrist is because if you're not for the word you're against it so you're anti-word that's right amen even if you're born again that's right that's what dad's been told you'd be born again in your snow you can be born again in your soul well how'd you have wesley and luther teach father son holy ghost baptism yeah and they had a new birth right i don't see that yeah but when you say anti-word i feel like the word's been uh offered to you when you turn it down no we're born anti-word you know what daddy's been telling us you're born anti-word and we're continue hang on a minute you'd be born again in your soul but that father son holy ghost baptism was never taught by the new birth so that's anti-word okay right is that anything in the word that was right no but god winked at that because it's been hidden that's why to you and i it's been revealed okay and we can take it and we can say we know what justification is we know what sanctification is now we know what the new birth is but we still why why do you think we need these virtues what if we got everything when we got the holy ghost why do we need knowledge what does knowledge do knowledge of the word of god cast out that antichrist that's right see people the antichrist is not our gender in here it's right here brother brown come to a place to where he was anti-word because the word he saw the white horse rider right away from him in other words that anti-word that he was had a part of before because he preached a while horse rider was the holy ghost that's anti-word that's not the word that's right that's anti-word see anti-word doesn't mean that you have to totally disagree with the word now somewhere you will or somewhere you'll come into this why do you think people are dying going by the grave they're not the fullness of the word they have anti-word right here this is anti this is always anti right here that's why the mark is 666 in the forehead not on the forehead in the forehead what in your intelligence that's what dad's trying to do he's trying to kill that anti against how else can you explain it how can you explain that martin luther went through the world with the baptism my holy ghost just like you got it right but yet he taught a false doctrine okay right anti-word but god winked at that knowing that you and i now we have no excuse zero right excuse now we come up to now where if we turn the word down then we're anti-word total okay all right does everybody understand that what the words got to do that's right they didn't have the true word that's why it's got to develop it's got to be something that develops in you that's right being born again well why do you need to being born again if you're don't have something anti in you that's right this is antichrist this thing right here is anti-word that's right it didn't come the right way right does everybody understand that i know you don't understand but you better understand your anti-word until the fullness of the capstone comes you better can i ask questions my question is brother browning said the evidence of the holy ghost is when you say amen to everyone that's in christ is the mystery of the reveal i can say amen to every word but do you make it fulfilled every day nowhere now no no my question is how can you have the holy ghost or the new birth in your entire world the same word i just explained it you weren't listening i know the flesh will never be saved that's right so that's what i'm talking about but this is anti-work like brother branham preaching the um white house writer is the holy ghost i look at it he had not uh come to the maturity of the word like in 63. so that's the entire word show me in the word where the holy ghost is the white horse rider show me in this word where the holy ghost is the antichrist as the holy ghost that's correct i'm telling you people we're so close will you tell me you explain to me how martin luther did it well he the only light that he had was the dresser that's correct that's right that's all he had that's right that's all you got until god revealed that yeah that's right listen people i don't care what you think that's what our problem is we say antichrist is oh they believe that out there no it's right here this is the anti now i'm not opposing you i just don't want to agree and i'm not seeing you okay you know i'll be i'll be foolish to just go along with everybody and i'm not seeing it but i want to see it does everybody understand where i'm going with this yes i am honestly i'll let you just say it and to god reveal it i mean you talk to talk and talk and talk about it if i don't get it and until god reveal it to me it's not going to come clear to me right and when he when he does you're going to see right you will see exactly what he said but you've got to wait for this and you're right about martin luther and john wesley they only had a part but that doesn't mean the word wasn't there right right right to everything else they were anti-word i'm sorry if you're for you're either for or against it's like me and brother uh tom earnest was talking about and brother donnie and i were hitting on it yesterday or day for yesterday no race intended it's black or white that's right there ain't no gray in between the gray in between is the devil that's right so it's either black or white that's right you're either a white righteous church or you're a white righteous church seeming to be i mean a black church seeming to be a white righteous church that's why we've got to have the antichrist driven out of us wait a minute now you got in your soul you got the new birth in your soul but let's just take for example well let's take uh both tom fogles why is he dead now oh he's 80 something ago well why is he dead some part of this let's just be honest some part of this didn't agree with the word or he didn't see it or he didn't say it he didn't see it he didn't see it okay would you say he had received all he was going to receive right right oh god god saw him receive what he was going to receive and right there was it but the part of him that was against the word went to the grave right but he didn't intentionally no i'm not saying you intentionally it's like it's like sister um like sister johnny said once it's once it's shown to you just like that right there's no struggling there's no but when it's revealed to you you instantly come to it or either if you disagree with it something's wrong with you something's wrong with you inside that's a good thing to know because you don't know you need you know that it's got to be straightened down until you know listen let's just i'm going to be hard that's what brother dale's been preaching for the past two or three months that's right it's not anti out there it's anti right here that's right that's right right here this is anti amen ask him he'll tell you pay attention in church he's trying to tell us this is untime this is okay but this is anti that's right brother why is brother dale say that's why we're still dying because even when we come to this capstone you're still brother brown came to the capstone but he died he went by the grave his work was over his work was finished so that's like saying okay oh but you can still sit in your flesh absolutely every day so that is like what you're saying that part is the answer you all are taking anti all the way over to the pope no that's not what i said i didn't say nothing like that that's right yeah you're not anti-like the pope just turned the thing down to start with you've got things in you that you don't understand that you struggle with let me tell you something let me be real let me we're okay sex is against the word that's right it's against the original word of god sex and if we do it then we're against the word of god that's why some people then though they take it over here to this side and they say oh don't have that no more no but then the bible comes back and says hey the bed is undefiled multiplying replenish the earth but now remember the multiplying and replenishing wasn't bisex to begin with it was by the spoken word but when eve took a what a thought that was anti-word she produced the product amen come on people we got to realize that anti's right here don't sit in church and think you're just so holy and pious and i know everything no we're anti-word until that word's revealed to us we're anti-words that's right on brother tom say he saw it like he's saying what would have happened taking a rapture if you the people that see the completeness all the way to a portion that they're allotted which is taking the forward of god to the headstone yeah they're not going to see death but now because death is the last thing to be destroyed and that's this thing right here you know how i look at it with brother tom um now if the rapture took place that time and he saw everything but god had a plan for somebody like jonas who was born after him i look at it like it was just not the time for the raptor to come in because we have born no you're seeing the rapture as a as a you're seeing the raptures that god's got a date on the calendar that's not it but i mean growing up though he didn't have to die tom died right but he's going up in the rapture the dead in christ shall rise first that's the one that's dead in christ that's why the new birth is the most important thing because see that gives you a free ride but it doesn't give this guy a free ride that's right then you understand what i'm saying because that's why we need why do we need all these virtues if we if we got the holy ghost and all we need that's why come on people we're missing the boat here not cut our hair that's wrong to reveal the whole word which had never been revealed down through the ages never even peter only saw a portion and you can say he was anti-word to the party he didn't see but because you're either for or against you said well i don't understand maybe we ought to use that we don't understand the word but what is that it's anti it's against right this was born against the word that's right brother branham said somehow maybe i'll bring that quote brother brown said somehow god came down through all this and he pointed it i believe he was pointing that came down through all of this and gave you the new birth so he birthed your soul not your body not your spirit memory reason conscious affection tell me that's born again you ever had a bad thought had one this morning so is that that is that word is that word yeah i'm telling you i'm standing here i want somebody to prove me wrong prove me prove to me that we're totally the word of god right now we're not going to lose yes we will i mean when you're out of here okay but we got to come to a place to get you you're thinking that god's just going to come on a day on the calendar now he's going to come on the day when somebody stands up and says death you don't have a part of this anymore and god's going to change these atoms why because of it the february the 23rd no because when you're ready when the word of god in you brother branham said what paul said i die daily so what are you dying from anti-word uh well when they asked for the brand and what was holding on to the rapture he said it was a great one and this is not a date not a day not a time it's you and i getting ready i'm glad this is this way it kind of shocks everybody it brings everybody to to realize that why do you think we needed the statue of a perfect man why did you think brother brown had to preach us back to brotherly kindness it has become anti-word down through the ages you know what i think throws people off it does me that word anti because that makes it sound like boom you're against this but when you're rejecting that's not rejected but remember when brother brown said we said that the antitype does that mean is this against the type and the antitype no that's just a part of the type it's just not the type it's an antitype that's right so anti is not always against okay but you're always agreeing with the word that's correct because it comes to you that's a sign of the holy spirit that's right but do you do everybody do you do everything that bible says yeah no no no because the whole thing hasn't come to you that's right right so you're against this right here that's why the word is so important nothing else is important see i think we and honestly let me let's be honest i think that we do we throw up a shield we're in the message we've got all the word that's the worst thing you can do that's the worst thing you can do is sit there and go we've got all the words so we're okay right no we're not we're in the worst condition we could ever be in it right that's right because we do have the opening of the word the open book right and we're denying it you say oh i'm not denying it well you got all the virtues working in your life our life proves it did we just do the most simple thing yeah that's right that's what i was going to say don't get caught up into semantics of the word anti-word that's correct you're anti-word until you obtain until that's right thank you sir thank you sister you have grown so much i couldn't have said it nobody are you ready you four and finish you got about 20 minutes but you are anti-war but when when you become anti-word like y'all are thinking about is when the words presented to you and you go no i'm not doing that that's not right right that's what they're thinking see that that that that that baptism i i i to stay with father son holy ghost or or we say well i got brother brown said have godliness to be like god but he said we've got to act like god that's right like mama said the simple things we do do we come to church on time do we read our bible do we study do we pray for the pastor every sunday not just when we think about it then you're against the word of god the bible says pray without ceasing yeah i believe what we do is this is our this is our um life is that we are because you can't you you put body spirit and soul and you make little circles there's no certain you can't cut yourself into and see three circles just like this you can't you can't cut yourself into and see a line of faith and a line of virtue and a line of knowledge or half a line of this no this is just for illustration purposes but it is that the holy ghost is in the soul waiting on you to bring the word to it right you say oh no it's the word now the prophet said he's in there waiting on you to bring the word to it and if you don't bring the word to it it's laying out there against that's right but when it's presented to you and you say praise god how many times you've been sitting up there and you've been wondering and struggling about something let me show your answer my word sorry but when brother dale bring something or any other preacher and you go that's what that means well you know what that just comes over and fits in a slot you got a little gap of anti in there sorry we do yes we do and it comes over and go but you know what people that are anti from the inside they go i don't believe that at all and they just let it go now that's anti that all are thinking i'm talking about but it's not i talk about that when the word's presented to you and you receive it we say thank god and we don't do that no more or we have come to a position that that doesn't bother us anymore then that anti parts don't brother brown said we sin every day as christians why do we stand what is sin oh it's not smoking drink concussion no that's the office that's why unbelievable what have i just proven my point yeah yeah that's what he said he said that woman stepped up and said pray tell man brother what is it he said it's until of this right here all right not what some man teaches you or your grandma tells you or your mama killed you it's unbelief the prophet said that unbelief is sin unbelief what so what is unbelief you have belief and unbelief for and again the word and time i accept that because i need it because then if you don't then you can have some of these virtues we're going to read it maybe read it in a little bit no we're not either we're not going to read anything hey we're going to use this thing just for a minute okay we'll come back to it let's just read what the prophet said about it though watch this but what i'm this is what i'm saying is we've got to realize though brothers and sisters that the growth process shows that we're anti somewhere yes sure just the growth process that's right right brother branham brother brown didn't say you got the holy he said you've got the holy ghost and you've got everything you need for your journey but he says he's waiting on him to bring the holy ghost is waiting on you to what bring him the word why not for the holy ghost for you the holy ghost don't need the word it is the word that's right but if you want to say it's kind of like a capsule you know what you take a pill and it's like a capsule all that good stuff's inside of it right right but what's going to happen if it stays inside that capsule it don't do you no good but once that thing dissolves in your belly because of warmth moisture good warm water water in the word what happens what's inside out and does you good that's what we have got to realize we got to realize that's why we that's why sometimes we as message believers go and a lot of people out there believe that once you get bored again you're way up here because it says holy spirit but brother brown brother brown we'll talk about it that's the holy spirit that seals it all together the total package deal not just the faith down here because this is a new birth down here and without this you can't have virtue so i want us to step here this morning and think that we're all lost and we need to be born again really that's something we got to grow that's the growth part that's why you you can say anti or i'm saying anti and you can say growth and it's the same thing to me i'm against the word until the words revealed to me that i've got virtue peter had a revelation that what he got on the day of pentecost he could use because he said silver and gold have i none he wasn't rich he'd actually quit his job he wasn't fisherman no more he was the fisher of men but he said silver gold have a number such as i have what he have he had enough virtue in him that god had placed in him to where he could say but what i have i give unto you okay now how many of us can do that we got to come to a place that this thing is and i fall short i'm not as a minister there's more guns pointed at me than y'all that's true because if god if satan can get me he's got you i've always said that if satan can get brother dale he's got all of us but if you can't get him he can't get us that's right that's why we need to pray for him hold him up and really pray for him because he's got battles and struggles he'll take his sins every day yeah yeah he's got unbelief that's what we do yes yeah his wife's shaking her head he's but i mean there's a part that he doesn't understand there's a part of life and we all have to live life and i was talking about the sex part don't take it to the other extreme where people say oh it's so dirty no it's not it was it was a loud of god you hear me aloud it's permissive well but god did say that that's the way now you need to multiply replenish the earth and be one with your spouse because we're supposed to have a relationship with god just like we have a relationship with our wife in a type he's supposed to make love to us and bring us the word and give us the word of god right we're supposed to embrace god and he's supposed to give us the word of god that's what it says but you can carry it over to the extreme bring it back to the middle of the road oh yeah i doubt if you can't love your wife you can't love god our husband our husband yes but realize one thing if you're not born again you can't have any of these virtues you can have a portion of them just in human life some people are just good nature they're just good yeah some people are not but the ones that are not if they get born again and they go up the statue of performance what's that doing that's killing that anti part right right that's the only way i can see it being born again by what the incorruptable word i didn't finish with the thing but by the incorruptible word see the word's incorruptible but we make it corruptable right we make it corruptable you're just agreeing okay i'm saying okay so all right let's read this what the prophet said just real quick so now let us read now first peter ii peter the first chapter simon peter servant apostle jesus christ to them that have obtained life precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ i like the way that stated right there because my whole subject this morning is based on faith let me read that again listen close simon peter servant apostle of jesus christ of them that obtained light precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ all right let's go notice he says that i have obtained all right because my whole life subject i got to get over here and put my pointer in the right direction this is all new to me notice he says i have obtained this faith and i've been dressing to them that has obtained the like precious faith all right that's what he's talking to the reason brother brown liked this scripture if you read them down through the statue of perfect man he says this is to the church those that are in christ so peter has brought it into a he's narrowed it down to where he's a sinner can't a sinner can't understand this if you've obtained like precious faith you've entered into the faith of god in your soul then you bring it the word and you see whether that agrees with what's inside of you or not if it does that's where brother brown said the holy ghost only agrees with the word that's the way you and i if you hear the word and disagree with it i would say i don't understand it is the best thing and you know what daddy says god's not revealed that to me yet yeah question mark not a period question god's not revealed that to me yet and there's a lot of things god had revealed to me yet but if i have the holy ghost he promised he would reveal it to me but you know what if i quit doing this and quit quit coming to church and quit studying and quit reading my bible guess what god's just going to take me off the scene remember the member of the preacher remember the preacher brother brown said he had the holy ghost he said i'm tired of it i'm finished he went and got drunk and started drinking two months later god took him home because he wasn't going to marry his name what the anti part of him took over sorry you say holy ghost and drink beer what the prophet said that's what brother brown said you know what you say it's the thing that's hard it is hard to understand but you just got to believe and say okay until i agree with the word i'm against it you saw i agree with everything do you do you let me read where you're supposed to be this and let me read where you're supposed to be that let me read where you're supposed to be this and and we'll see on that brother god's not an indian giver that's right he was his son and like anybody child he came home no the boy made a choice true if he would have chose not to started start drinking he let a spirit get on him that was against the word of god i'm sorry he did he let a spirit get on him that was against the word of god that didn't mean he's not a christian yeah that just meant god wasn't going to let him do that very long that's why you see a lot of people dying and doing things you don't understand a lot of things we don't understand that's why we just leave it alone that's right god takes somebody home you never know what's going on in their life okay because god's dealing with them god's dealing with me and you one on one right individual affair with god you're the one that knows whether you're treating your wife right whether you're treating your husband right whether you're slipping around and cutting your hair or slipping around and saying little bad things or taking this or doing this who knows only you but one day it's going to all manifest one day it's all going to come to life but right now we're in a growth process how can brother brown say there's made believers true believing unbelievers in every congregation he knew because he could look into the inner part of man you and i can't do this like dad said i'm totally glad god don't give me discernment of what y'all thinking about while we're preaching we'd be very discouraged because we could see the made believers we could see the unbelievers they would be black remember the woman or man would walk up in the prayer line he said i see you have a you're very pleasant in other words they had the holy ghost he had the holy ghost right even a woman preacher would come up and he said i see you have a wonderful spirit about you now that's the anti-word but see that wasn't the part she was supposed to play we know now that's not right but she's gone on to be with god and her reward so we don't know how that how that played out but if you got the holy ghost you shouldn't be preached you shouldn't be preaching but now we know in our message believer camp all of us we see that you're not supposed to one was not supposed to preach so now we see that if you are in the message and you think you can preach you don't have the holy ghost you're anti to start with right but see at that time he did she didn't know that we got to go real quick here but she didn't know that wasn't revealed to her yet but once it was revealed then it goes right around watched a lot of times they come he says sister whatever you've done you need to get it straightened out blah blah blah just like jesus told that girl in the bible go and sin no more unless the worst thing come upon you same thing with you and i we need to be careful we are sinners saved by grace but we still have sin which is one more time i want you to say it yeah my unbelief that's anti from belief yeah right right oh steady yeah we'll get to this maybe next sunday
