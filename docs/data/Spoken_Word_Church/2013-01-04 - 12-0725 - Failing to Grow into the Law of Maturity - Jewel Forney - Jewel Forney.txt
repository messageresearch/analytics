of my heart me foreign i am foreign and the church here we appreciate your love and brazil will come together this evening i'm just going to take a little simple thought tonight i trust god it'll be a blessing to you i'm going to be reading from the book of first corinthians the night the 11th chapter of first corinthians 11 chapter no wait a minute i said the 11th chapter let me hold on first ripped in the 13 chapters are in 11 verse first corinthians 13 chapter and 11 verse and second timothy the third chapter i'll be reading from but i'll begin it first corinthians 11 13 chapter and 11 verse i christian my wife stayed back with the grant because she every night then the grandkids following him got nine i think i know just had another baby would just turn one in june so you just thank god for that hey man uh i'm going to read the 11th verse pickle paul speaking first corinthians 13 chapter 11 verse paul says when i was a child i spoke as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child right but when i became a man i put away childhood things let me go to second timothy three for one verse from there second timothy second timothy the third chapter verse seven paul's activities speaking here says ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth let's pray i gracious father help me one more time to yield my body and my mind my soul to you father father god i give you all my script this evening lord and father i trust that you take over and bless your peoples father yes in jesus christ's name i like the way the scripture says here paul says here when i was a child because i thought as a child all right praise god amen my brother forgot your name brother dan you pray i just saw you out in new mexico man you want me to call me when when i was a child i thought as a child i understood as a child he said but when i became a man i put away childhood things right i like the way he said here and then we finally in the book of timothy said forever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth if i had a title i'm going to use this title failing to grow up into the law of maturity and the word maturity means a full grown as a plant and it means they're ripe and it means the comfort formation have a fruit layer in the sun also and i look up the word immaturity i invited me a simple-minded person it means that christian bay hallelujah so we realize him paul we realized that child here we we looked it up it means one uh to make sport as a boy i need another word you come i didn't come i did not come to play church we did not come to make a sport we come to grow up right it's what god required for us to come to maturity so we will be ready when the rapture takes place i took your uh brains that make it clear enough in maturity so we begin to look at the lord help me to grow into the full stature of what you want me to be right so as i begin to go in and i think on the things that that god wanted to come to that full stature of a revelation of the word of god amen now i begin to think here i begin to realize we see something that's not growing something that's growing normal like when i go overseas and especially when you travel the sea you'll notice sometimes you'll run into a a lot of children that be born with no hands i'll be born with no legs from birth that child will come that way from birth you'll see that child in your heart and go out because you realize that child ain't got no arms and no feet on all the legs and nothing like that but my burpee was born that way but when i started that out the only reason that child was born that way because something was wrong with his dna right how did something went wrong with the dna it was something that his body needs that he didn't get right right so we realized we are not growing properly and we're not growing normal if something is wrong and we're not coming to maturity there's something wrong with the gene of god all right right you got you you claim you god right your experience with god something wrong with that spiritual experience right how many if you're a son of god you must come to that law of maturity because god put a gene i'll put a life in you that develop itself right on the full statue of jesus christ that's right learning something over and over i find in the messages that travel through the years here and the thing that we find the most other people still going around service you know themselves you come back and they're still going in the same house that they had last year and the if you're learning something over and over and you don't never if you fall in a hole and you keep falling in the same hole you're not learning right quick the school they call it a learning disorder yeah right there's something wrong with your revelation how did that suddenly roll with your faith how did god been trying to teach us to have faith how to hold them to the word of god and still people say i i try to be saved but i can't make it i tried to be saved and i lost myself thank you and if you ever get a revelation you're a son of god you get a revelation where you come from and if you ever get a revelation where you come from you get a revelation where you're going i make sure you don't let nothing ever push you down only because you know who you are right yeah man some people get here look at maturity for a few minutes cuz i look at this here and i begin to think what is maturity maturity is mature person that learned how to handle himself in every circumstance circumstances do not control you right you control the certain things come to the revelation that he is able to control the circumstances now when i was when i was a child it was not important i could jump up and go to work right come on you know how they were 40 to 50 years old you know you said if you didn't feel like going to work you would call in or make any kind of because you feel like it ain't going to work today out here and i'm going to enjoy this day i got things i need to do but when you begin to grow up and become a man you look at your two little children and three little children you say i gotta make my body get up and go to work because i gotta prepare for my family right for you to do that and then we begin to relax here so we gotta we gotta grow up we gotta come to that level maturity so if we're gonna become we're gonna grow up we're gonna have some law in the world to grow up under right management something's gonna teach us majority right all right when i'm studying this i said understand this in inspiration use the scripture so i did let it go to saint john 8 and find out here we got to have some guidelines we got to have some guideline to teach us because we gotta go we got to grow in maturity so we gotta have some guideline to grow one right so so i pulled up saint john eight saint john eighth chapter i want to read one verse from there say john a chapter verse 32 hey lord jesus speaking to him jesus said ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free all right so now he's telling us yes you know the truth i'm concerned about truth right honey if you're gonna mature in faith you gotta mature in the truth because you cannot have faith without every truth and in the world shall we find him that he will jesus come how did he say when i come shall i find faith on earth exactly right not only shitty fat truth all right that's right jesus was concerned about truth he was not so much concerned about your condition and he wasn't concerned about did you have a heart to speak truth right so when it came to the woman and she was caught in the act of adultery her body was messed up her life was messed up everything she died you could look back and say she was no good she did this and she didn't die but when jesus said go get your husband she gotta help you he said you said true exactly how because he was concerned about truth right yeah i think he needed the word he knew she was in that condition she would speak truth he knew that she could receive truth right so if she can speak the truth she can receive truth so when jesus said jesus said woman you have said truth right because maybe he always knows the truth yeah he said you have said truth he said you have had five and the one you got not your husband how did he begin to go and reveal our condition and set him free because he sees something in her that spoke the truth right amen he didn't see that in the pharisees right he said you are the liar and your father's alive but because he knew that they couldn't speak truth holly didn't have no true feeling so he said your father is a liar you got a testimony you love me you got to testify you serve me but you're already fall from me right exactly right until we come back so he says here when i come shall i find faith he was living for one day and god is concerned about one day right he's concerned about faith because without faith nobody leaves this earth right nobody leave the earth without faith all right because it's impossible to please god without revelation faith right amen so you know the bible said when he come shall he find faith on the earth so what do you he didn't say what he would look he just i was looking for how holy you look that comes along with it your might conform to that but people deliver and have a dress code and not have faith right right amen hey be good people can live holy they can look holy and still not have faith shout out by the faith all right man tell us somebody right they got the same revolution of faith that i live by amen somebody that walked by the same revelation of faith that i won't buy anyway you said brother jordan you can't walk by the same faith that jesus walked by it ain't for one faith and if you got famous the same thing because paul said the life that i now knew i don't live by my life but i live by the faith from the son of god say revelation in jesus up have christ so he was concerned about faith yeah and the story goes when jesus come on earth manifested in the emanuel which is interpreted god with us that's right god came down kepler's skin welcome us right honey and welcome on his own people and they could not generate enough faith to accept what he really was right right he never found the faith he was looking for in his own peoples right the faith that he found was in gentiles that's right you know let's go to state memphis you said you used scripture yet because i'm about to become a new book right my shields opened made my mind real right so say matthew eight same same thing they look at jesus he was looking for faith and he never found nobody with this type of faith he finally come across a man that had the same revelation he had right right let us look at say matthew 8 verse 5. the bible says when jesus had entered into capernaum that came unto him a such a satanist proceeding him saying lord what you didn't notice here he came to him the sixth verse i want you to notice how he approached him his approach was with the word right he did not approach him in son of david because jesus would have rebuked him instantly right yeah because jesus wouldn't send the david to the gentiles right and then so he said lord he report he approached him in his redemptive name how do you approach you in a redemptive name i am the lord thy god they heal him all that he's either i'm the lord jehovah i am the lord raphael and i only read the title that gold in the name of the lord he said lord all right he approached him with the right title yes hallelujah if you notice in this title he never turned nobody away because it was a redemption amen hallelujah shall hear you so he said he said lord my son relies at home sick of a sick of apology greenlee told me in other words this guy didn't just have a toothache right he had a demon but he had a demon problem right something that was told me to him to irritate him something something that that something that you know there's something on the inside of you he couldn't just shake off he had a demon problem right now and what that this young man said and he come to him the seventh verse i want you to watch jesus as he speak to this young man jesus said unto him i will come and heal him right why do you think jesus said this because jesus knew that none of them other brothers ever believed that he could uh have faith except he went to the house and brought his body down yeah all right right that's right they had to touch something to believe right but if you have to test something to believe you ain't got proper faith right because faith is the evidence of things not even seen right so everybody be funny so know what you think you say why you said you got attention why do you think michael said lord if you would have been here my brother would have died right because they looking for jesus body to be there except or instead of accepting his word his word i seek my word and my yeah right touch the him of his glory for me i could be made whole a by the way get up here and pray for me i can be made whole i mean by people you don't need that body to be healthy take the word let me preach on this pulpit say marty already told me the word i am held by the power of the holy spirit amen some people want something to judge yeah so jesus had never been approached in the word by somebody that had the same faith right so jesus he'll go to this man first off jesus said i'm gonna let me go to your house yeah this man turning jesus down yeah the lord the lord is the king of king the lydia yeah you gotta be kidding jesus sitting right at my table yeah hallelujah hello man he he sat right in my chair jesus said that a lot of people tabled and they didn't get healed right right how did you say his body being at your table don't mean that you got the proper faith to be healed right so this man is turning jesus down no you don't need to come to my house you're right come on i don't need your body yeah i need your word because he understood in the beginning what the word amen holy he said i don't need your body to come i need you for this that's behind your body all right amen and jesus said unto him i will come to hear you and the security answer to said lord i'm not worthy if i should come under my roof but what speak the word only i don't need nothing but a word from you right i don't need you to come to my house i don't need the world black brother i don't need for you to go fishing with you i don't need to go hunting with you all i need you to do is speak the word that's right amen then he says him and my servant shall be healed this man think was so positive he was he did not testify or hope so of maybe so i think he will he that he shall my covenant is not my covenant is in the word you speak i realize who you are and i understand the power and behind your word i have heard what you've done i appeared in my chosen one i have heard about you knowing this this man was not a disciple of jesus this man didn't go fishing with jesus this and my faith come back here i can't hear it about all this he realized this has got to be god this has got to be repented and you're only god to do those things that's right exactly he says him yeah he began to explain to jesus who i know who you is right yeah if you would break this down in spiritual terms if you could open up the scene what you had meeting on earth to omnipotence all right yeah great man all right right they got to be something supernatural for your faith the same thing something got to take place because a man it have perfect faith and one before god right come on something's gonna happen right man two omnipotence meant amen all right and this man take control of the conversation right this man didn't need nobody he knew and he said i am a man under authority he explained his position right right i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goes until another come and he come right and to my servant do this he does it he explained the power that was behind his word right right he explained that behind my word was the power of that state that was backing him up when i say to this man do what he do it right right amen when they tell me to do it i tell the next man to do it right here i understand this tell me about what he says right and the ten verses says when jesus heard it why jesus heard it because they come back here jesus went saying that he was listening let this man talk and the bible said when jesus heard it he knew it was perfect faith he knew that that was the revelation of perfect faith so nobody said he was not talking he was listening when this man was speaking and it moved him yeah and said unto them that father probably brother i said to you bloody brother i have nothing i said to you i am not found so what jesus and it was not our sensation it was not that shock it was about taking god in his word yeah take me up you 15 chapters say me if you're oblivious you're saying that let me see here let me begin let me find my place here in the 22nd verse and listen behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cried out to him said lord have mercy on me no lord you're saying have mercy on me oh lord thy son of david my daughter is grievingly vexed with a what not judgmental thing this demon was causing a major issue right and this woman had got tired of dealing with this baby right she got tired of the time what it was doing she's not telling her i'm going to probe jesus right and she no doubt she had hearing people calling himself today how you think she approached him that was she heard she did how this is when she came and she said not seven david and what's the 23rd verse but he hasn't heard or what people hate to be ignored all right but somebody didn't know you you normally get an attitude especially when you're speaking to somebody in the wreck and you talking to that person and you say something and they ignore you you normally get an attitude because we still mature yeah right all right what's wrong with that crown yeah can you hear me speak to it all right you know that's the way human reaction work yeah right let's do it jesus she's speaking to gina and he don't even have another word because the way she approached him was not for her right right she says him and he has heard not a word any disciples came in and we saw him saying send her away for she cries i does yeah now you know they was not grown they didn't have the holy ghost they were two churches but but did he say but he didn't he all right they actually sent her away jesus all right let me get rid of him he said but he hasn't said i am not sick but until the last sheet of the house of israel right then she came he said i'm not sitting there i am not sitting in lawsuits israel and then the mother said the twin river and worship him said lord help me and he answered and said it is not me to take your children bread and cast it to doubt right he heavily rebuked this woman right but you get changed faith what a dog healed the dog the lord thing one of the lowest creatures he's not identified and no sacrifice the bible said beware of dogs right yeah right all right spiritually speaking yeah right hot dog and she said true lord she acknowledged what he told her was the truth all right honey and then when he called it it's the truth we was undone we were shaking and everything we were lord and judge the dog that's true lord exactly that's not true true yep the dog keep the crown that that would fall from the master table and when jesus did jesus said unto her oh woman great is that thing right be it on your deed even as god willing and her daughter was made whole from that very hour because she understood revelation right faith move god amen now give me a few more minutes here let's wednesday night keep you all night don't get nervous you're fine so here it is we want to talk about mature faith faith that's growing yeah if you're not growing something wrong right right exactly if you're not growing if your faith is not coming closer to god something wrong so we know that mature faith now we're going on here because we got to see somebody bring an example of a true faith all right somebody live the example of faith that's growing right now right i looked in here i i was talking about dancing you know abraham was the perfect example of faith that grows right yeah honey he started off with a little mustard seed but at the end of the day it became a big tree right highly so his faith never stayed neutral right his faith growed right so abraham was called you've been with god called abraham he's able to get me up from that kendra's right and go to the land that i'll show you amen he told them to do this abraham was growing yeah amen just didn't get up and leave he carried his uncle with him a nephew with him yeah he get a daddy with it he didn't say he didn't want it to be abraham and his daddy he wanted to be able to help and him alone right him and his wife alone because she was under the same government so he wanted abraham to get up and leave but he didn't know because he'd be like i just take the rest of him along you know this is an individual wow it ain't about your mama it ain't about your daddy it's me oh lord amen and we know the story how it goes finally here god come down to tell abraham you're gonna have a son we understand that and abraham all right you know that was a good promise so now the point of it was abraham in his mind and sharing her mind thinking that we're gonna have the child it's gonna have to happen next year yeah yeah i cannot be the woman that he got in mind right i know i'm i'm almost past that and i know that i if it don't happen next year we're gonna have to come up with a solution yeah yeah yeah so she did hey god yeah yeah doesn't do it create your own so you can grow closer to god i'll give you something to keep you on your knee praying i'll keep you at the well and walk right right i'll keep you crying come lord jesus and got an ishmael right that's right you said sarah took this boy raising his own son yeah i did but the point over there told abraham yeah right you gonna have something god said it and we got to keep professing it keep hold on until it comes to passion one year two years three years maybe 12 years maybe 18 years next day 25 years later to abraham got to the point that he couldn't even help himself all right noah it was no way impossible scientifically impossible that said sarah will be able to have a baby and abraham to dry it up it was no hope that when god generally moved them all when it come to the end of the day when there ain't nothing else you could do but give up and say god you are in control i'm at the end of the road that's normally with god stepping right this was impossible scientifically was the medicine there was nothing to help abraham in the condition right right right because the birth of several women was dried up right that was good to dead people so god had to give a type of resurrection right so what did he do he took the clock and he reversed it yeah right so erin him had to back back though 25 years ago he might have went back a little further because he went back so far with the king saw sarah she was pretty beautiful yeah and he wanted my and he turned them back to young men nobody said they would turn anyway they would turn back i just didn't reduce the child anyway she would turn up again and they will help me tell you that was the revelation of this episode right honey the day of christ arrives right all right abraham the servant turned back how did something produce this child and when they return back here it was to bring a type of the bride he turned back he had to go get old and die he would turn back young he had plenty of churches after that right right those years between that he had a lot of children died this man kept multiplying right he had to be turned back to do this he would turn back but that was to give a type of bride we're going to be turned back and the dead christ should arrive right his mature reports abraham had to know how to have his civil circumstances sure so god revealed himself as el shaddaic revelation god when his name was changed he was growing in the majority right revelation 17. god never changed his name when he's named the change abraham was mature right how did he was growing into a mature son of god dude growing up right here everybody here abraham growing up that god turns around after abraham and tell abraham offer your only begotten son yeah and i looked at that as a guy couldn't have been abraham had abraham had ishmael too but abraham didn't have ishmael right abraham right but god changed his name he did away with his old book right according to romans 7 his old husband was put away in the silver forgiveness and god never saw you smitten right right god only saw a new birth right now god only saw where he come right how did god say he get away with his ishmael he did away with his ishmael nature and god said i said so now he's growing and maturing to hell himself and needing services so now they go to washington as it goes to church where they have grow up come a young boy maybe 12 years old so did god say off of this boy yeah now abraham faith knew how to handle any circumstances oh yeah because now this is a great tug for abraham to do they're going up here to worship after saying father i see the fire i see the night for words of sacrifice abraham made a mature show of god new description if god could change me back young if god could give me the son i thought i'm a dead i know that my god is able to raise this boy up out in the land of the ring we're going to go young and run worship and we will return because god said out of here in that seat i'm gonna call this generation right amen amen that's right right but his word was stolen his faith was so slow that abraham released this faith and created power stepped into existence let us look a lot he was nephew lot left the church come on me out right when he joined the two lord church abraham believed he went down there and when he separated from abraham he shouldn't have left my church if he wasn't the lady would have stayed here he would have made it we're leaving one church yeah amen and it's the body of jesus christ right but abraham just had the attitude that we had right abraham says here abraham said i love my nephew and i'm not letting go of you i'm not going to let circumstances influence my faith because we check we look at symptoms we look at things that people doing a lot of times and we make a decision but i don't see how they can be saved that one you need faith right because if you can see how they're gonna be saved everybody's being healed yeah but faith will be yours the human error faith will be young out of a mistake and faith look at the promise if you have faith for yourself take that same thing and hold over your little one all right abraham said i'm holding on for lot yeah right i know lot don't look good down there he got tied up in a worthy church he don't even believe the same way i do how do when you leave the message you don't believe the same way people do automatically scratch you off yeah i know a brother one time a message for a powerful guy he said a brother left his church went out in the world say come back and he said brother don't even come to my church he said your name is scratch off the book of life oh lord i'm the old god give me goodness lord actually come to the point that we make right we got the ability to tell god how to love i'm holding on yeah yeah so when the agent got ready to reveal abraham his secret tell everybody what do you need to say oh yeah abraham i'm going down to discourse talking tomorrow yeah yeah ain't never thought about it the spirit of reconciliation was moving on that's right honey i'm not letting go right right i'm not looking at the circumstance check out my children to go so far we say don't forget them don't you never say forgive me right take your faith and reach way over there i don't care how the service down look god said i can help end results of it in three minutes but let me finish this out so abraham said i'm holding on for lot he said lord if there be 20 righteousness yeah yeah would you spread the city lost all right if i've had 20 righteous on i smell the city yeah huh hold it hold it lord wait a minute all right if you find a kid down there with you right the lord said if i find a king i spread the city come out on the faith because abraham's hell no right amen absolutely all right that's your question you thought about this i wonder why abraham held going a lot like the best thing your kid you know you know you think you hear him lot doesn't backslid already he down in another place he didn't join another church yeah you know let the hypocrite go yeah but they never haven't let martin go right let's look at the end results if abraham had a dark in the sea for luck abraham with himself by not holding on by faith he wasn't denied it the whole limit that jesus will come to you know jesus had to cut the roof and roof come over here and that old man come catch it and jesse come david right right all i right this go ahead now go to the message because this is i find more people faithful than this age and this is my statement i have made these statements in my own self we talk about faith we talk about perfect faith all right amen what do perfect maturity brings you to right to perfect understanding of perfect revelation of forgiveness that's one of the powerful things to do right you said that's easy to try come on it's easy to try yeah we got to learn what true forgiveness is right forgiveness is that god give me a revelation not only to forgive but he gives you a revelation to forgive it and forgive you right that's right human beings can't forget all right you're right with the holy ghost amen all right all right let me take let me let this use this real quick before i go full maturity bring you to the full revelation of forgiveness right right right adam was a fool between me right sure i had never had to suck a baby ball he never had a neighbor but all right he growled up with teeth man and he was a full grown man god gave me full grown authority i want you to do the earth i want you to keep it in line with the words if it get out of life you should do it put it by your life with the word right adam had full authority right and he broke that authority right not happening right exactly the bible say he was guilty of the transgression not adam adam knew what he was doing right let's look at the story a forward mature son of man for mature son of god walking there was supreme authority in his hand whatever you say on earth yeah i wish he would have spoke the devil that existed so i went ahead and got bald headed man my teeth wouldn't have never fell out we all would have been born perfect yeah but since adam didn't react as he should at that moment because he was in the condition we're here now yeah yeah all right but if there's a threat see if there's somebody saying i get it oh wow i'm gonna hear that word it sounded good when i was saying 30 and still time 50 start slightly different but here it is god gives him that he goes out and completely completely more herself yeah about wrong relationship right now adam could have not took her back right one for the church but he said she he should not have to go back right because she was already devoured right right yeah adam looked at his wife and adam says i love her and i'm gonna forgive her yeah regardless of the consequences right i'll be glad with the message yeah with that way adam looked him close and he said i love her she's bald in my mouth she's brushing my flesh all right all right yeah i know what it's gonna cost if i walk out and get her i'm going to sell all my sons and daughters in the because of sin and death right when adam did that adam left no way back no right right when he walked out and took into himself he took the whole human race and sold us into death that was you know right right how did he even know what we didn't know what he did here we wouldn't have been in time if he would have done that right but without him done that he crossed the council right because he loved him but when jesus looked down and so adam yeah yeah he loved his son he said no i love adam he's born about he's worried about work he's spirit of my spirit all right all right amen god couldn't destroy adam and remain god because he created the good news of god right so when they restrainted god to come down and pay a sacrifice so me and you when i could go to hell he came down and went to hell in our maturity bring you to their revelation not only could god forgive but god can forgive that's right so regardless when he said offer your only begotten son as and you say well ishmael with abraham's son but god can see it right romans 4 god never saw ishmael yeah god saw one son right because god put abraham all life in the sin of forgiveness god can remember what he'd done from that point right hey look at that so this is my statement because we all want to face this sometime of noon we're going to read a 100 adoption book pay 47 because i made these statements before and this has been the statement he said i went after brother not long ago that went astray a young man said to me let the rest to go i have made you friends and let him go we don't let nobody go we hold on that ain't up to us to let him go that's up to god right so he says here and he said i said as long as i got as long as as long as i got hey no i said if i ever get to a place that my heart does not go with my brother it's time for me to go to the altar because i fell from grace all right well how many people's done backstage he said i said i go as long as i got breath in my body i catch him somewhere along the line yes sir i caught him and brought him back because i had a faith he said i'm not gonna let go right right i don't care what the consequences are i'm claiming my grandchildren i'm claiming my children i don't care what it looks like and i'm bringing this still closed over the years i traveled the most uh tropic over the years by god grace last 26 years been preaching the gospel when i find the most of all all of it it's so sad that i find people year after year that come up for the holy ghost and i go back to nature and they're coming up for the same thing right i said something is wrong right right right they come up in their prayers and i pray for them i brought sam a prayer for them brother david daniel back to prayer for them and then we shout all those services i got it i got it this time did you come back next year they didn't know i don't understand how you can have the holy ghost right then and don't have it a year later right right something is wrong with your revelation right man so i begin i begin to look at this thing i find it hard for people to stay safe but i was saying whether you want me and not not ain't saying that right you and i began to look and i found out the reason the bible said i like one thing in 1st john 3 21 say if my heart could give us not we have confidence for god so we have if our heart is condemned then we got we are ruled by a spiritual condemnation the condemnation is the spirit that hinders spiritual growth oh yeah in other words if you got condemnation something wrong right because paul you know it in that way we find here and i begin to say what's wrong what brings on condemnation i want you to listen close what brings his own condemnation why people get so beat down so condemned condemnation becomes the superior doubt in their mind yeah i'm so condemned yeah i'm so beat down why is it wild if i didn't have no bad luck i wouldn't have nothing at all condemnation yeah and i'm looking here i i got to be announced and it was in philippians 3 and 3 when it said have no confidence in the flesh right that's right too many people and too busy trying to get this right but they get the heart right right right that's right and why you got people looking around i'm a little better than him hey yeah we more hold it there i tricked it and that's what you find out here in your own flesh is your own enemy right right i knew you found out you can't live right and you can't do what you thought you could do you know you beat down again right you're right back at the same order trying to get the holy ghost because you were looking at you not looking at the land right how do you guard it if god was in timber you don't put your covenant into yourself he would have put a mediator between god and man right amen he wanted you to get your heart and your faithful christ because if you don't look to him you'll never have the scripture to live right all right all right amen amen but he's gonna have no confidence in the flesh all right and too many people still trying to perfect the flood that's why we got all this legalism and random messages all this man right here and i ain't never done this i ain't never drunk i ain't never done it people you were born into sin shame in the new jesus it don't matter what you ain't done we all need grace yes we got this we don't put it on a level i ain't done have no covenant in the flesh i mean according to romans 7 that teaches us it teaches us and tell us if there is no good thing that's dwelling in my flesh all right all right that's right so condemnation is when you start putting your companies in you right and not in christ right right remember you gotta have your faith in what god done for you right all right not what you do for you right because if you could have did it you wouldn't need him to come you know that's right so now you say my brother jewel i got a problem i'm always a deal i got a problem i got condemnation in my life life and i i believe that it ain't no way to get around to condemnation i'm full of condemnation then you will miss the mark all right amen he said that how you doing because the contemplation control to you something is wrong with your spiritual growth that's right i am how do you know let me read the romans man 8. right man look at romans 8 real quick my clothes i'm not ready to parachute that's right hold on one minute condemnation watching romans 8 verse 1 the condemnation has got you beat down and you say that's the way i am then you are saying that god has got power to move this fight right paul said there is death for now know what no condemnation to woo all right deal i'm putting myself in there which are in christ jesus who walked not after the what but i didn't know what we got so that paul said there is now no the problem is one word people don't understand with no meaning right yeah yeah all right you actually better withdraw me i got a grandson yeah then jeremiah he be doing something wrong and i said jeremiah did i tell you no not to do that and i said do you know what know me more he look at me and say yes sir i swear to me don't do it no more what no condemnation mean the knowledge but we ain't got the revelation to what it is right right that's why the church is so beat down and people so we get and people don't have no testimony because they ain't come to the knowledge right what is really the experience and knowledge what it is right i got another aggression then you're right and uh my wife would clean it my wife i went to oven to sell cleanses up so she had no and my little grandson he's about two years old he walks up to the stove and he says grandma it's hot she said yes it's hot i said no no don't touch it so now he gets the revelation and knowledge of what heart feels like yeah he you got the knowledge he was hot yeah but he never had an experience with what hot is right so he said grandma was hot she said don't touch it that's a no-no so when she was looking yeah he sneaked him and he touched that back not only do he got a knowledge he got his own personal revelation because his body almost breakdanced right 67 adoption bro this is the thing i'm hitting the market people we got to get our faith all right right right we're going to find ourselves in this edge people's falling away people's giving up for the son of god kick you up right now all right brother doctor blood paid 67 to the close he said now what does master teach to paul the first thing he knocked out is all the idea of falling away golden way is the idea right it's the idea that you put in your mind i'm not good enough to make a rapture yeah it's the idea that you put yourself you cut yourself short i said i'm a son of god i'm not gonna be there i got too many problems i got this brother i got that brother that is a idea yeah yeah i ain't gonna be good enough who told you that yeah but i'm gonna get myself how long we did how many years did it take you to figure out that you weren't gonna be good enough yeah that's right so god give a good looking at yourself and look at christ right amen if i could ever accept christ in my birthday and he come in my heart it ain't that i've been good enough he will make me good enough to be in the tragedy i will never be good enough you will never be good enough to even take your beauty right right that says the second christ he one day you say did they get you back at christmas go to church on wednesday sunday they probably two day three days all right yeah man this is the book that's not addressed to your evangelistic teacher but listen we do not we do not touch this on the field i bring this to the church paul is dreading it to the saints those that are called and reserved and filled and set aside and already and all in the holy ghost already in decaying the land yeah so now you say this is not addressed to a court of believers right because when you deal with call them believers you begin to say what are you going to be saying god got you saying hallelujah you are about to say hello i don't care what you do you know what to call the body and say well it don't matter if i drink yeah yeah ain't nobody right here god i want to tell you what you better read the rest of romans right it don't say to stay neutral it said to be conformed into the image of the living god so you got to change somewhere right let's homosexuality and what his philosophy was if i'm a son of god i'm going to be saved anyway no if you're a son of god you're going to hey you cannot preach this to call the people right because they're looking for a way well if you're a son of god you're going to be there if you are a son shutting down you're not heard from your thing happening you don't like the things of the world right in the world and you are changing to the image of the living room and so here i am to worship i'm doing something see you

more hallelujah when you love somebody you don't want to hurt them right but when i got the holy ghost and i fell in love with god and fell in love with my wife i couldn't do that i got the holy ghost
