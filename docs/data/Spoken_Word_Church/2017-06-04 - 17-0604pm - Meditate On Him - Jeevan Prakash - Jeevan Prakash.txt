hallelujah in the message called blind but this is the message almost three hours we take in India three hours three pages three hours in India so I don't think three hours today so when I'm here in this country I'm very careful about the timing 45 minutes one hour so here you know blind bartimaeus the prophet of God preached in Lima 1957 here he says blind bartimaeus setting by gate perhaps in the sunshine of the direct rays of the palestinian sun shining on him by the wall blind bottom is you know that the prophet of God you know told us a lot of good things about him you know oh my he was walking from home huh to the highway and sitting there whole day he was not worried about the sun is shining a hot Sun huh maybe it is 80 degrees or 70 or 90 degrees or 100 degrees 100 in Palestine it's hot weather believe me you know I went to Dubai Sarge and Abu Dhabi you know for 20 days there is a message churches there you know and I couldn't survive there I couldn't survive there it's hot hotter than India I have a spiritual Sunday in Dubai you know he used to take care of our orphans old widows you know and when he was here in India then you know not open the doors for him to go to the Y and there he and his wife you know they are working for the university you know government University of Dubai you know and he told me dad please don't come this time come always in October November December so that's that's a little cold there in orders but in Islam for May and June and all these April May and you it's hot you know so I couldn't survive there it's hot but he we see here the blind Bartimaeus he was helpless he need to take care of his wife and daughter that's what the Prophet said you know and every day you know I don't know what to go into that you know but every day he was walking and he was sitting on the highway near the wall huh that's what the Prophet said here you know and so he was meditating upon the Lord maybe sweating you know sweat you know ah maybe his dress his shirt and pant you know maybe whatever his dress you know it was sweating you know it was you know and even though he was praising the Lord he was meditating upon the Lord it's very important if we can meditate upon the Lord always let God help us praise the name of the Lord hmm let's think that he was setting and meditating he was sitting there on the highway he was sitting there on the road huh begging you know and you know to feed his wife and daughter there's no way because he was a blind from his mother's womb hmm in those days you know and and the Palestine you know those countries you know it was it was it is poor countries as if if you see now maybe because of the oil you know they are rich you know but in the older days you know it was different you know the way to find God is to meditate upon God think of God think of God not only on Sundays not only on Wednesdays not on your Christmas Day not only near Thursday not only our Good Friday or Easter Sunday think of God of this hmm that's the secret you know the way to find God is to meditate upon God think of God David spoke of it how we would bind the laws on his bed posts and how we would meditate therein day and night David was sitting on the bed or sitting on the chair and and not you know telling his captain's telling this so you know soldiers you know go there do this do this do this then

place beautiful line you know and what what what a a beautiful road and they were all tucked some other things you know but they were talking about Lord Jesus and that time he stepped right out of the bush and walked with them right meditate on him my precious brothers and sister meditate on him trace the name of the Lord hallelujah hmm and if our minds would be more taken up on God and on the

praise the name of the Lord he's saving you from Lord of troubles Oh bye hmm that it takes the meditation on the Lord to bring him in your presence huh that is right always it's while we think on these things that Christ appears wherever you think of Christ he appears is there is there when you get up in the morning you know when you get up in the morning from your sleep he's waiting before

should pray nobody should oh my dad was very terrible he said I can't I can't stay without praising my god not even a minute not even you know and he was he was he was he opened the windows and praying God you know three times a day and his enemies his enemies were watching him and they went and and complained to the king huh anyhow King was kind to Daniel but he couldn't do anything because he already signed the decree hmm oh my Daniel was put in the lion's den ah but there he was trusting God he was meditating upon God maybe Ezz he was afraid if it is in his in his body because he's he

the name of the Lord hmm meditate upon the Lord praise his wonderful name hallelujah thank you Jesus so I believe that this reason people doesn't have the victorious life in their hearts they should

think about the worldly things I believe that the reason people doesn't have the victory in their hearts that they should have because of that thoughts are on the other things let the meditation of my

world true religion true meaning through salvation this is we're just going in anybody have any needs before we go into the communion and the foot washing just let it be now honoring any thing that you that to the sister wants us to pray with the little boy if I prayed with him downstairs but they want us to pray with him because he's been injured by some people that hurt his body so let's just pray him that pray for his mother he's having troubles - okay father week is wearing is on yes-mo undefined your strategy contingency Lord we pray for that we must see argument God we believe in your

thank you said if you shake your word healed I should cease and deliver distribution yes ma'am so we thank you in Jesus if anyone else Thanks so let's go into our scripture in Corinthians and we do before we can do after so let's just have a moment of silent prayer that we just wait on the Lord before we go into this and we're that way you can get rid of your any problems you have you know I want all my hands to be clear and if you have any thoughts or not ask God to forgive you see then just let him to take care of that and get it all out of the way if we do that and we just believe it so let's pray before the Lord and wait just a moment other we just think you that we have an opportunity today to be able to know and understand the reality of the communion and the things that we do we just asked you to come on the scene now and just bless each one and Lord make us all worthy to be partakers of this that we Lord we call it a ritual but it's not because it was set in order by you Lord we love you and we thank you just bless each and every one of us cleanse us as a whole group of people who sanctifies all together in you and make us worthy in Jesus name 1st Corinthians 11 for having received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you but the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body but this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any hung man hunger let him eat at home as you come not together under condemnation the rest when I said in order when I come it's a very solemn time to come to the communion we don't believe as a lot of people take it and leave it the priest has the power to change it and make it to literal blood or make it's a literal body you know we don't believe in that that would be contrary to the scripture because it would not be Jesus Christ doing it see that claim is ooh oh yeah we we have that power book I just don't see that because the communion if we really took it correctly commune means to fellowship it literally means to fellowship to get together we soul no it's to bread in the wine that's just the symbolic that goes there that we do but we know that the that the bread is not the body we know the wine is not the blood but we do know that it's the state of mind of the individual that's thinking about what is taking place because the Lord Jesus that was his last act was to give him the bread and give him the wine and any pie stone all right any in that he was explaining to them not that they were to do that essence time but it was a what they should think about who was taking their place think about it in the communion who took your place it would make us worthy of this Bible said he took the bread and blessed it father we thank you for this Fred's been made for this purpose for that the Lord we just thank you that we understand the truth because we know it's not your body the Lord is a symbol and what about a symbol and you lord it's a it's a loving understanding of what you've done for each one of us you gave your body in our place you gave your life to come and live in each one of us we ask you now that you would just think about a bread and the protectors that we may all be together is wanting you in Jesus name see it was a broken body that's why we don't just do like a lot we don't just stay order to bread it and keep it and put it up or to be at least more concerned than that to understand these things see this this bread was made today it will be burned before morning we won't keep it in house communion again I'm not throwing no stone but win it bad this we used to order at least keeping the freezer and just freeze it and keep it you know you know no I got but it's not to be that supposed to be ever done that's right man I felt every diet right it wasn't do it is bell every day said it's not that and then it is supposed to be on leaven it's not opposed to be just some Oh wafer if somebody's made you can order them you can order it you can get the little bread and you can get the little cups you can get everything you can do all kind of things down but that's not what it needs to be done it needs to be more sincere think about these things but what it means and what he done right into pious dish that we could protect like I said then we don't try to hold it over we burn it before the day ends because you don't try to hold it you know what happened in the in the wilderness and they had that manner it was great but when they tried to hold it over keep it to another day it would rot so we don't do that we do it in the correct order hey under Nanjing nice but we thank you for this wine we know that it's not your blood we know that for certainty and we know we made it in this Thai refer to be used but it is a symbol of your blood it was given for each and every one of us the Lord of symbol is a great thing because we will eat this little piece of bread and will drag this little bit of wine and tomorrow that will be blood cells yes maybe in our bodies for us to little instances and we thank you for that we just asked you to sanctify the wine and the protectors if we maybe do the recording you into sister come morning now walk by the river I'll rest knee the ever green tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning Dyer's glory for me sometimes I despised and rejected and I questioned Oh fall under how long then I take one more loo at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to come morning hour by the river I'll rest knee the evergreen trees I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning nerve lorry overly it's really something to know true Bible says you shall know the truth the truth will make you free what about the world has tied up with rituals and ideas and that's not throwing off on them did you go to one place today and you have the Communion and the priest would give you the bread you eat the bread he drinks the wine because he's your Holy Ghost that's what do you say you go to another place and it would be done this way another place has be done that way some people would have scream and holler at you say we take wine they so know we take grape juice well take some grape juice and set it out in the cook leave it sitting down a while and you'll find out it'll run the wine gets better with age see then your your grape juice wouldn't be a top of the blood of Jesus Christ because it wouldn't fit like I said we make the bread it's made it it's unleavened bread it's made pacifically for one time units for this service and you know to be born burned because we don't try to hold nothing over and keep anything we try to do what the Word of God says the truth sets us free and that's wonderful to thank God for what we see and what we're doing you go back in there and you just get to reading some of that Old Testament and you'll find that there was different things left and there was a thing Jesus wasn't contrary no neither did he had anything new when he done the breaking of the bread and the giving of the wine if you go back study the Old Testament it was reserved for those things there was a thing to happen way covered it years ago for us there was a thing there in the scripture that's left when Jesus took it he didn't start a new thing he really brought into being what they were saying it's like when those used meat you know what they do they leave us here you know why because they leave it for Elijah because they believe he's going to come say all of those things were not just you know it's the Word of God yeah that's all protect again amen you can be a seated for a moment you like it ready you'd like to turn in your scriptures to the foot washing there's like another onesie some people do this and some do that we just try to follow the word it's in the word to be done why don't we do it why don't we fulfill the word this is the letter so the best that we know to do and understand John 13 and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto Him Lord just I wash my feet see that's what a lot of people would say today well you know when I wash feet we don't have to do these things well Jesus done you all just brought it over and explained the communion John is explaining the foot washing right and then if he's going to do it why can't we see when he comes to Simon Peter Peter said to the Lord Lord does not wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what I dude I know it's not now but I shall know your laughter Peter saith unto him I shall never wash my feet look at him jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me he said well that was only a spiritual washing agreed but if you have this spiritual washing I guarantee you're going to have the physical you won't argue about washing somebody's feet if you get to spiritual washing of your soul right and everything laying in order to right Simon Peter said to him Lord see once he said it if I don't wash you well no part with silent Peter saith unto Him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head the two dirtiest things it could think of right jesus said unto him he that is wash neither's not saved towards his feet but it's clean every wit and you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him darfur said he you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and taken his garments and was sat down again he said unto them no you what I have done to you you call me a master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet / have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things I like that last part because people would say does it really matter does it really matter about washing feet and time I like that last part what does it say happy REE if you do well don't take away my joy you're just going to what you want to okay let's stand together and be dismissed the sisters will go downstairs without the foot washing thank father we thank you for all this been said and done here today for our brother that's relative basically unto us and we believe it we thank you and we ask you to be with him as he traveled home Lord going about preaching ministry for you we ask you to just bless each and every one of us as we Lord go through this foot washing time and then we're going home time and we'll just give a safe journey to everybody may we all reach our journey's and in good health and love for you but sanctify each and every one of us and forgive our sins and Lord as we would be servants because you was a servant enough even though you were God of all yet you would get down and wash the feet of the people and even wash Judas's feet that would be the one that would be to turn you in yet you would do those things we ask you to just have your way got each one we love you in Jesus name in him you just means sisters to go downstairs
