[20:56] and we can see him this evening even but
[20:59] here's the difference between the way we
[21:01] think we should be able to see him and
[21:02] the way we see him is if you close your
[21:05] eyes and look with the eyes of your soul
[21:08] you'll be able to see him God bless you
[21:10] thank you
[21:11] musicians it's a privilege to be in the
[21:14] house of the Lord with you yes it is a
[21:16] Tuesday night forgive me for disrupting
[21:19] your week but every once in a
[21:21] while there I guess there has to be a
[21:24] disruption amen an interruption of
[21:27] nature I think brother ROM called it but
[21:29] it's a pleasure as always to be here
[21:30] with you and and um you're you're just a
[21:34] part I know of the family of God and
[21:36] we're a part of the family of God so
[21:38] you're just an extended family all right
[21:40] or we're the extension of the family
[21:42] whatever you'd like to say but since
[21:44] it's Tuesday night and I realize that
[21:46] people have to work and they've been
[21:47] working and there's children that go to
[21:49] school I want to get right into the word
[21:51] of God if that's okay and uh we'll give
[21:53] it all we got for 45 minutes amen now
[21:56] what you're going to get is a lot of
[21:57] nuggets
[21:59] you polish them yeah that's right
[22:01] because I don't have time tonight to do
[22:03] that but I'm going to give you as much
[22:04] as I can I've been preaching uh at home
[22:08] uh and like most pastors really we
[22:11] preach in series and that series is from
[22:14] Genesis 1 yeah to the end of Revelation
[22:17] all right but the good thing about God
[22:19] is the Genesis was the beginning but
[22:21] there is no end to Revelation so if you
[22:24] would uh if you have your Bibles and you
[22:26] like to turn it's Proverbs 23 and: 7 uh
[22:30] familiar scripture I just thought I'd
[22:32] use it to to get you in your
[22:35] seats and it pertains to where we're
[22:37] going to be going
[22:40] tonight Proverbs 23:7 just the first
[22:43] part of the verse for as he thinketh in
[22:46] his heart so is he father we thank you
[22:50] this evening Lord for the reading of
[22:51] your word father that would be
[22:53] sufficient right there to bring to bring
[22:56] the universe into existence Lord Lord
[22:58] one word from you father is all it takes
[23:01] father and that's the way it would work
[23:03] Lord but tonight we're here father we
[23:06] want to settle ourselves down lord and
[23:08] we want to put our spiritual thinking
[23:10] caps on as the prophet told us Lord and
[23:12] and maybe fasten that seat belt Lord for
[23:14] a short ride we love you and we thank
[23:17] you Father and we'll be careful to
[23:18] always give you all the honor and the
[23:20] glory and the
[23:22] praise because of what you've done for
[23:24] us Lord in Jesus Christ's name pray amen
[23:29] God bless you may be seated now my voice
[23:32] might sound a little scratchy but you
[23:34] know coming from Arizona in that real
[23:35] dry climate and I don't come from the
[23:37] hot part of Arizona as most of you know
[23:39] we come from the cold part of Arizona
[23:41] it's a small place but it's cold and uh
[23:44] but still dry yes sir and whatever you
[23:46] got in the air around here just got my
[23:48] throat scratchy I don't really care I
[23:50] want to get into the word of God so so
[23:52] we we we've got this portion of
[23:53] scripture here everybody knows and of
[23:55] course we would paraphrase it as the
[23:57] prophet did for as a man thinketh in his
[23:59] heart so is he is that right we we
[24:02] understand that now I would like you to
[24:03] turn to uh Colossians if you
[24:09] would uh let's see if I got that right
[24:11] NOP NOP no NOP hang on hang on no no we
[24:15] done Proverbs already okay it's a
[24:17] Philippians chapter
[24:19] 2 amen amen it's a Tuesday
[24:25] night and every Journey for me is a long
[24:30] Journey long that's right
[24:33] brother amen I I shall I tell him my
[24:37] father's last name is
[24:38] Long my mother's last name was short
[24:43] y that's that's a
[24:46] fact that's why they didn't get
[24:50] along but God saw me that's it I do come
[24:56] from a broken family
[24:58] they didn't get along cuz they were
[24:59] Irish and they like to drink but through
[25:02] all that through all that God saw
[25:08] me I'm so thankful I tell you I'm so
[25:12] thankful I'm so
[25:15] thankful are you
[25:17] ready did I say Philippians 2 verse 5
[25:21] everybody know this knows these
[25:23] scriptures let this
[25:26] mind be in you
[25:28] which was also in Christ
[25:32] Jesus now if you're going to now
[25:35] listen this is a proposal did you know
[25:38] that right he's saying let this mind be
[25:42] in you so now it is a
[25:45] choice he's he's proposing to you to let
[25:48] this mind be in you now how do we know
[25:51] if we have that mind well that mind has
[25:54] particular
[25:56] characteristics first of of all it
[25:58] allows
[26:01] you to be in the form of
[26:05] God but not to think it's robbery to be
[26:09] equal with God now that doesn't mean
[26:12] you're going to be God that's
[26:14] right but you wouldn't think it was
[26:17] robbery for the Lord to come down and
[26:20] tell you that you came from him and
[26:23] you're going to go back to
[26:25] him CU brothers and sisters the whole
[26:28] the whole world is in chaos right now
[26:31] there is an identity crisis going on
[26:35] right everybody is trying to identify
[26:38] with what they think and what they
[26:39] believe and who they
[26:42] are I want to be identified with
[26:49] God so I want this
[26:53] mind and this mind has characteristics
[26:56] and attributes
[26:58] and they are identified in verse seven
[27:00] but made himself of no reputation so
[27:02] right away if you're going to let the
[27:04] mind of Christ be in you you are not
[27:07] striving for a
[27:08] reputation
[27:10] oh it seems like everybody wants to be
[27:14] reputed for
[27:16] something I want to be reputed for
[27:18] nothing amen cuz God takes nothing and
[27:22] make something out of it okay so that I
[27:26] want this mind and I want to let it be
[27:31] in me as much as you want to let it be
[27:35] in
[27:36] you so there are some characteristic
[27:40] requirements there's things you look for
[27:43] things that you want to identify amen
[27:45] sir by having the mind of Christ amen
[27:50] all right on
[27:52] brother he took upon him the form of a
[27:55] servant yes he did
[27:58] that knocks a lot of folks out amen they
[28:01] want to be served they're not interested
[28:04] in serving if you're not interested in
[28:06] serving you have not allowed yourself
[28:09] yet to receive the proposal of let this
[28:12] m amen being you right it's real simple
[28:17] it's not complicated all right and was
[28:21] made in the likeness of men and being
[28:23] found in fashion as a
[28:26] man he humbled himself oh another
[28:29] requirement there it is another
[28:31] characteristic you see it's not the law
[28:33] of God we're talking about it's the mind
[28:35] of
[28:36] Christ and if you want to let the mind
[28:39] of Christ be in you then these
[28:41] characteristics are going to be the
[28:43] basis for
[28:45] it humbled himself oh my come on right
[28:51] and became obedient unto death even the
[28:54] death of the Cross now I read those two
[28:57] script scriptures again I'm going to
[28:59] cover as much territory as I can but I
[29:02] want you to get
[29:04] this if you can't or you don't or you
[29:07] won't ponder it think about it meditate
[29:11] on it now when I was when I was
[29:14] ministering um on on a series about
[29:17] Abraham which I probably touched on here
[29:19] the last time I was here I began to
[29:21] think about Abraham and how that Abraham
[29:24] was different but then the prophet of
[29:26] God would tell us that Abraham was just
[29:27] an ordinary man he was a man just like
[29:30] or just like you and
[29:32] me just just a guy off the street who
[29:36] who who had a job probably didn't like
[29:40] it cuz it was
[29:43] work brother Bram tells us he was just a
[29:45] common guy would go out and you know
[29:47] pick vegetables and had his little plot
[29:49] and and he was just eting out a living
[29:51] now he came from a very think about this
[29:54] he came from a very uh uh successful
[29:58] area it was a very it was a very big
[30:01] area of wealth so probably Abraham
[30:04] didn't
[30:05] care about the the the things that
[30:08] everybody else cared
[30:10] about you know he had access to it but
[30:13] he wasn't interested in it he was an
[30:15] oddball as we would say he was a
[30:19] nut Lord but he was threaded right he
[30:23] was threaded right he was a nut but he
[30:25] was threaded right wasn't m
[30:27] n wasn't SAE Lord it was the word of God
[30:32] that was his thread amen now in this I
[30:36] started to think about how God was
[30:40] brothers and sisters
[30:44] look who doesn't want to be a child of
[30:48] God Amen well there are people who don't
[30:51] but we're here cuz we want to
[30:54] be right and it's easy to see
[31:00] that World War I is at hand now I say
[31:04] that cuz you see it in the news but has
[31:07] anybody ever noticed something about the
[31:09] news they don't want to admit that there
[31:12] is a God and that this is his word
[31:15] that's why they want to destroy Israel
[31:17] because God's word says Israel is my
[31:19] nation I don't care what what what she
[31:21] does I don't care how she acts I mean
[31:23] she's going to
[31:24] [Music]
[31:26] pay see mine mine amen believe that
[31:29] brother and I want you to notice that
[31:30] the media does not use
[31:33] Armageddon cuz that would give
[31:35] credibility to the word of God no this
[31:38] is World War I they say
[31:42] Amen we've been fighting in this battle
[31:45] since the day we
[31:47] stepped into the armor of God that's
[31:50] right if you only realize that there's a
[31:53] world going on around us that we we we
[31:57] can't see taste feel smell or
[32:03] hear now I I couldn't help but notice
[32:05] that brother Wade has a a print out on
[32:08] his desk of a Triune
[32:12] being and and I'm I I've been preaching
[32:15] on this for weeks yeah okay see I I gave
[32:19] you away your secret
[32:23] okay well let me set you up brother
[32:27] come on so let this mind be in you and
[32:31] then we see I I begin to see
[32:35] something so I'm not a
[32:37] theologian I'm a guy that's interested
[32:40] in God's word I'm interested in in in
[32:43] and in what God wants of us uh how he
[32:47] would like us to carry it out of course
[32:49] we have lots of
[32:51] baggage I would like to get rid of the
[32:53] baggage I I want I I want it to be a
[32:56] clean break amen I want to go all the
[32:59] way I know you do too but I'll use
[33:01] myself as an example so I don't
[33:03] embarrass anybody but I looked up the
[33:04] word mind come on man now let this mind
[33:08] be in you now the mind is is is is
[33:12] peculiar to its definition listen now
[33:16] the mind is a spirit in the dictionary
[33:20] you can get the same dictionary Mariam
[33:21] Webster whatever it is Spirit if the
[33:23] mind is a spirit or
[33:25] Force used to direct guide or give
[33:30] directions to one's thoughts oh soon as
[33:32] I read that brother wait I'm going to
[33:33] tell you he got me yeah because then I
[33:35] saw by definition the mind and the
[33:37] thoughts are separate right amen
[33:41] abolutely the mind is the conduit for
[33:43] the thoughts and if you want the
[33:46] thoughts of God you'll have to have the
[33:48] mind of Christ cuz he won't put his
[33:51] thoughts in anything else it's got to
[33:55] come down through that ch Channel now
[33:57] everybody listen now the access to God's
[34:00] thoughts
[34:02] are right
[34:07] here if voices are traveling through
[34:09] this room if pictures are traveling
[34:12] through this room
[34:14] right so are the thoughts they're right
[34:17] here amen right now amen and we all have
[34:21] access to the thoughts of God but it
[34:25] must be the mind of Christ now you do a
[34:31] little studying and you're going to find
[34:33] out that there that that that there
[34:35] there's a mind of
[34:38] God and here I am preaching on the mind
[34:41] of Christ why because all that God was
[34:46] he poured into Christ and the reason he
[34:49] could do it is because Christ had the
[34:51] right
[34:54] mind so we need to get our minds right
[34:58] now there's a problem with that brother
[35:00] Wade in that we seem to have two minds
[35:03] yes come
[35:05] on we have our
[35:07] brains and we have our heart what you
[35:10] say the brains that's just a mush yes
[35:13] right right believe me that's all it is
[35:15] amen and the heart is just the muscle y
[35:19] that's what it is but we found out
[35:23] there's a cavity inside the heart real
[35:25] small about the size of a
[35:30] pee that's
[35:33] available the prophet of God told us in
[35:35] his day that they found out that there's
[35:37] not listen close there's not even a
[35:39] blood cell in
[35:45] there well what's in
[35:48] there God voted for
[35:53] you Satan voted against you
[35:57] I'm going to tell you what's in there
[36:00] your
[36:02] vote and the reason there's not a blood
[36:04] cell in there is so that it cannot be
[36:07] contaminated until you make the choice
[36:10] right then it's either the blood cell of
[36:14] God or the blood cell of the
[36:18] enemy now you're on your journey and
[36:22] that's what started the thoughts of God
[36:24] I want to ask you a question what is
[36:25] more important be careful before you
[36:27] answer it's not a trick
[36:29] question but I want I want it to sink in
[36:33] what's more important the
[36:36] blood that is the carrier of the life or
[36:40] the life it carries that's right
[36:43] amen let that soak in a little bit the
[36:47] blood but it's it's it's got a purpose
[36:50] the blood in type is like the mind it's
[36:54] the conduit it's the carrier it's the
[36:56] vehic IC Le for the life now we know in
[37:00] the Old Testament you put the blood on
[37:02] the doorpost and the lentil so that it
[37:04] could be identified that a life had been
[37:09] given see but the life once the blood
[37:12] was placed on the doorpost and little
[37:16] left there's no life in there I love my
[37:21] I'll get an
[37:25] avocado because an avocado has a big
[37:27] seed that's why I like to use him as an
[37:29] example okay you can see that seed if I
[37:32] put it right there on the
[37:33] pulpit we're a Triune
[37:36] being amen but listen careful we were
[37:40] made in the image and after the likeness
[37:42] of then God's trying
[37:47] being think about it we were made in the
[37:49] image and the likeness of God if we were
[37:52] made in the image and the likeness of
[37:53] God then then then then God must
[37:57] we we must look like
[37:59] God but only in our Tri Unity remember
[38:04] when God made us Man In His Image it was
[38:07] not a visible tangible flesh man it was
[38:12] a spirit because God is a spirit so it
[38:15] was a spirit
[38:17] man catch that but that Spirit man was
[38:21] Triune amen you say well no it was
[38:23] invisible see we're trying to look
[38:27] with these eyes to see God I mean I'm
[38:30] going to get right into the meat of it
[38:32] if I can I'll let you out here in 5
[38:36] minutes we're spending an inordinate
[38:40] amount of time and it'll become a waste
[38:42] of time if we constantly are trying to
[38:46] find ourselves in God In the Flesh right
[38:51] amen he is a spirit right
[38:54] amen so then it's going to take a spirit
[38:57] man to be able to identify with the
[39:00] spirit
[39:02] God not the flesh man so now we get into
[39:05] predestination oh you don't understand
[39:08] brother maybe I don't but I know who
[39:13] does this body of Flesh this guy you're
[39:17] looking at is not me
[39:21] n I'm I'm quoting the prophet I already
[39:23] know that the people I'm looking at it's
[39:25] not you
[39:27] well we spend a awful lot of time on who
[39:31] we
[39:34] aren't we take care of it we nurture it
[39:36] we we clothe it we feed it and we should
[39:39] why because it is listen close a vehicle
[39:43] yeah I know this sounds crazy I'm not
[39:46] telling you to wash your
[39:48] car brother Bram spent a lot of time
[39:53] keeping his stuff up not because he was
[39:57] OCD it was because he had a revelation
[40:00] that what God gave him required a
[40:04] certain responsibility can you imagine
[40:07] Adam the man put here Genesis 2:7 to
[40:10] till the soil and and and and tend the
[40:13] garden I get to tomorrow yeah yeah but
[40:17] look at the weeds yeah yeah I'll get to
[40:21] tomorrow listen careful before the fall
[40:24] I don't think there was any weeds
[40:29] but the seed was
[40:33] there the seed was there but not the
[40:39] weed
[40:40] itself so as long as Adam kept God's
[40:44] word that weed seed would never come
[40:49] up and Adam kept God's word but he had a
[40:54] other
[40:55] half
[40:58] did do you not think that God
[41:02] knew
[41:04] exactly what was going to
[41:07] happen I guarantee you if he's the God
[41:11] we believe he is he
[41:15] knows
[41:16] everything amen I do have something here
[41:19] on that if it's okay Brothers I'm sorry
[41:22] you didn't get
[41:24] this listen
[41:29] but we got a
[41:31] kingdom the falling apart of the
[41:34] world 1216 to 62 Jeffersonville and but
[41:37] we got a kingdom and in this Kingdom it
[41:40] has eternal life amen praise the Lord
[41:43] okay yeah not
[41:47] membership but eternal life am and it is
[41:51] governed by an eternal King amen an
[41:54] eternal Kingdom full of eternal life
[41:57] amen controlled by an eternal King to an
[42:02] eternal people
[42:05] amen come on that's us if you believe
[42:09] it's you it's you you fill that space in
[42:13] that heart with the germ blood cell of
[42:17] God and it's your kingdom
[42:21] too a kingdom is no good without
[42:24] participants absolutely right
[42:27] right I don't think you could call it a
[42:30] king if it was the King of Nothing
[42:37] no listen
[42:41] careful I'm not getting off my message
[42:43] but I I know where I'm
[42:45] going so I ain't gonna keep you here
[42:50] long to an eternal people that were
[42:52] predestinated listen careful before the
[42:55] foundation of of the world brothers and
[42:57] sisters that's not the body you live in
[43:00] this is a body of time
[43:02] am so there must be another
[43:06] you who is in another
[43:11] place at another
[43:14] time
[43:16] right now see predestination that's why
[43:18] brother Bram said it's a touchy word for
[43:20] the church because he knew that we were
[43:23] in a body an element a time frame a
[43:26] creature that that could only uh you
[43:29] know understand by the parameters and
[43:32] the and and the and the fences and the
[43:34] and the holes in the
[43:38] fence they're still trying to figure out
[43:40] what's in them black holes yeah you see
[43:43] they can see them but they can't see
[43:46] through
[43:47] them
[43:49] okay he said for those to an eternal
[43:53] people that were predestinated before
[43:54] the foundation of the world for those
[43:56] those who he fornew he
[43:59] called and those who he called he
[44:03] justified and those who he's Justified
[44:06] he has glorified Hebrews 11 he says
[44:08] that's right now it depends on what
[44:11] you're looking for amen amen you see
[44:15] brothers and sisters a long time ago I
[44:16] stopped looking for a connection between
[44:19] this Fallen man and God there's a man in
[44:24] here who can turn on the light
[44:27] there's a man in
[44:30] here who turns water to wine there's a
[44:34] man in here who gives sight to the
[44:37] blind I'm looking for him cuz I ask
[44:40] myself well where is he I believe he's
[44:41] in there what what's the problem right
[44:46] it's still in the
[44:49] form of a thought right it needs a
[44:53] conduit it needs a vehicle
[44:56] it needs the right kind of mind
[45:01] to that's what Jesus had that you and
[45:06] I are working towards but not by works
[45:09] now it's a battle that's what we're in
[45:12] we're in a battle and it is the greatest
[45:16] battle ever fought amen which has become
[45:20] the greatest battle ever thought right
[45:23] amen notice the time we live and excuse
[45:28] me does anybody know what AI
[45:32] is what is
[45:34] AI thank you but in my Bible it's a
[45:37] place in the Book of
[45:44] Joshua it's a
[45:47] battle an artificial intelligence
[45:50] unfortunately is what was
[45:54] guiding
[45:59] the person yeah who caused all the
[46:03] problems for Joshua and listen innocent
[46:08] people lost their
[46:12] lives in the Battle of
[46:14] AI I want you to listen careful now I
[46:17] have a whole message on that but I just
[46:19] want to put this in there you just look
[46:21] up artificial and then intelligence and
[46:23] you'll find out where the trouble is
[46:28] that's all Satan's
[46:29] got he does not have the intelligence of
[46:33] God so of course anything outside of
[46:35] that would be
[46:37] artificial you with me
[46:40] bogus it would be an
[46:42] impersonation of intelligence it would
[46:44] be bogus
[46:47] intelligence if you read your Bible
[46:50] you'll find out where AI comes
[46:54] in listen
[46:58] aen did not steal anything from
[47:04] AI That's not in your
[47:07] Bible he took from the previous Battle
[47:10] of
[47:12] Jericho because if you look in your
[47:14] Bible you'll find out that's where don't
[47:16] take nothing and and and and don't touch
[47:19] the accursed
[47:21] thing so what's my point please don't
[47:25] w't bring anything over from the
[47:29] previous battle or it will become
[47:33] artificial intelligence and it will cost
[47:36] you your life brothers and sisters and
[47:40] we're there now think about it ai ai ai
[47:43] we are to me it's anticipating
[47:46] intelligence if you ask me that's
[47:49] because because it doesn't seem like
[47:50] hardly anybody has
[47:54] any you know you you know what I'm
[47:56] saying it's like what can't they see
[47:58] that that that that that that's that's I
[48:01] mean can I give an example again I'm not
[48:04] but Okay so we've got this battle in
[48:06] Israel and and and
[48:08] Hamas I'm not talking about the
[48:11] Palestinians talk about a terrorist
[48:12] group attacks
[48:15] Israel and then people come out and say
[48:17] destroy Israel because Hamas is there's
[48:21] practicing genocide Hamas is not a
[48:25] nation no Hamas is a group of people who
[48:29] have decided to try to destroy Israel
[48:32] it's backwards they're trying genocide
[48:35] on Israel Israel's just protecting
[48:38] themselves from the from the people who
[48:40] are trying to destroy Israel think about
[48:43] it and but but oh oh they're they're
[48:46] trying to genocide the Palestinians no
[48:48] they're not
[48:50] no you and I know that we should it's so
[48:54] simple so where is is this Intelligence
[48:56] coming
[48:58] from AI
[49:03] amen and of course there's a price to
[49:06] pay it wasn't Joshua's
[49:09] fault it wasn't the warriors's fault who
[49:12] died in battle in AI it wasn't the
[49:15] warriors's fault who carried out God's
[49:18] word and went to battle it was
[49:22] somebody who decided that they would
[49:25] disobey God's word and sneak something
[49:28] into the camp amen kind of sounds like a
[49:32] word to the church with to me in Christ
[49:35] This Is The Mystery of God revealed kind
[49:37] of sneak in and fellowship and all
[49:40] everything's good everybody nobody knew
[49:42] brother that that aching was
[49:45] aching until innocent people began to
[49:50] die Joshua had a word from the Lord he
[49:52] said hold it all it right there
[49:56] stuff the battle I imagine that the
[49:58] people they were fighting going hey
[50:03] chickens Joshua knew if we're going to
[50:06] win another battle right if we're not
[50:09] going to lose another man we got to root
[50:11] this thing out we got to find out what's
[50:14] going on now he didn't know yet but then
[50:16] he was a prophet so God began to deal
[50:19] with him as a matter of fact let me tell
[50:21] you about Joshua he was a type of the
[50:25] Holy Spirit today and the Holy Spirit
[50:29] will use his ministry to root out and
[50:32] tear down destroy and run off every aen
[50:38] yeah ouch amen I'm just giving you the
[50:42] Bible I happen to believe it amen right
[50:46] amen it is hot in here isn't it is that
[50:50] me or the
[50:51] temperature okay thank
[50:54] you full of of eternal life controlled
[50:56] by an eternal King by his Eternal Word
[51:01] to a predestinated Eternal people amen
[51:05] that is why it always was always will be
[51:10] never had a beginning or an end in the
[51:13] mind of God when it was with God
[51:16] eternally and the purpose of God will be
[51:18] carried
[51:21] out so if we get into a a an INT ual
[51:26] discussion on predestination as I'm
[51:28] using for an
[51:30] example we'll lose every time because
[51:34] the human mind cannot make the
[51:37] connections because it's not connected
[51:39] to the human mind it's connected to the
[51:42] spirit of God which existed before the
[51:44] foundation of the world where the lamb
[51:46] was slain in the mind of God Amen yeah
[51:50] and then there was a
[51:52] book what was the book representative of
[51:56] the thoughts of God were put down on
[52:00] paper as the mind of God and it carried
[52:04] out right want you to see this for your
[52:08] thoughts and your mind are two different
[52:10] things that's why we have a battle going
[52:13] on inside of us there's two Spirits
[52:16] guess what they'll be so
[52:19] close how close are they they're in you
[52:22] right now amen and we are taking down
[52:26] the Enemy by taking over the territory
[52:30] that Lucifer thought he
[52:34] won but see he doesn't know the thoughts
[52:37] of God he's trying to manipulate the
[52:39] Mind amen he can't touch the thoughts of
[52:42] God but God has released to you and I in
[52:45] the day we live in the
[52:51] ability Christ is the mystery of God
[52:53] revealed and it all finish
[52:58] everybody knows these quotes but they
[53:01] are so
[53:02] delicious especially when you begin to
[53:06] come down to the level where you dying
[53:09] out to yourself and then God's thoughts
[53:13] begin the new resource in you right now
[53:18] God's secret mystery he had before the
[53:21] world began yes sir amen back in the
[53:26] back part of God's mind he was keeping
[53:29] it he was not letting it release it was
[53:32] in the conduit but it wasn't
[53:36] released it's like having a six
[53:40] shooter and there's one bullet back
[53:44] there that you sa for
[53:47] last you got
[53:49] five I'm out from out west so you long
[53:53] gun guys only get one shot
[53:56] guys in the west have two six shooters
[53:59] they don't have to be a good
[54:00] shot they just have to pull the trigger
[54:02] that's right just basically aim yeah
[54:07] okay he had before the rule began now
[54:09] back in the back part of God's mind
[54:11] there was something listen that he was
[54:13] trying and was going to achieve now what
[54:15] blew me away brother Wade is when I read
[54:17] the word trying God's trying this is God
[54:20] we're talking about he brought the whole
[54:21] universe into existence he he's
[54:23] omnipotent he's omnicient he's he's
[54:26] ones he knows everything and he's going
[54:29] to try to do something of course he's
[54:32] going to do it y right but I want you to
[54:34] understand something about God that I
[54:36] never realized until recently he's going
[54:38] through the same battles that you and I
[54:41] are because he set it up that way you
[54:43] see he became us so we could become him
[54:46] now when I say
[54:48] us we're all thinking this guy here
[54:54] no let us make man in our image he
[55:00] became us so we could become him this
[55:04] thing right here is nothing but an old
[55:06] beat up car I noticed you got a new one
[55:09] but you drive it long enough it's going
[55:11] to break 10 year warranty yes I'm wait
[55:15] until the batteries go out I know it but
[55:18] I want everybody to understand the
[55:20] example look at our bodies oh you you
[55:22] you young people in here I I remember
[55:24] when I was 18
[55:26] 192 look
[55:28] out I lost a few fights but I got into a
[55:31] lot of
[55:33] them CU I was a smart alec now I want
[55:36] you to know I got saved from that amen
[55:39] when somebody comes across brother with
[55:41] something and then they say you know we
[55:42] go I got saved from that I don't do that
[55:45] anymore because I was from the world I
[55:47] wasn't from the church so I could when I
[55:49] I could spot a worldly Spirit a thousand
[55:51] miles away why cuz I got Sav from that
[55:53] yeah right that's I don't I I don't go
[55:55] there no more now somebody that was
[55:58] raised in the
[55:59] church you just hear my son Ronnie he'll
[56:01] tell you all about it yeah he'll tell
[56:04] you yeah on the front Pew you know Dad's
[56:06] the pastor blah blah blah blah and he
[56:08] found out one day by looking in the
[56:10] mirror you scoundrel you you dirty dog
[56:13] all this time you thought just because
[56:15] your dad was saved and preached the
[56:18] message and was a pastor of the church
[56:19] that you had it going on
[56:22] yeah who was that down in there who is
[56:25] it inside of you brother B say that's
[56:27] not you that comes from somewhere else
[56:32] and that's what I'm preaching on I'm
[56:34] preaching on the mind of God Amen but
[56:37] the mind of God is the conduit that
[56:39] God's thoughts Channel Through why do
[56:41] you think he brought the pillar of fire
[56:42] into existence the pillar of fire is a
[56:46] conduit how do I know that because when
[56:48] that Pillar of Fire shows up
[56:50] occasionally an angel steps out of it
[56:52] you know he's six foot tall 200 lbs
[56:54] right right yeah he's not smiling no
[56:57] he's
[56:58] not because he's
[57:01] serious I I don't think it's because he
[57:03] can't be
[57:06] happy I think it's because God didn't
[57:08] make him that
[57:10] way God made him to be serious did you
[57:13] know that there's a part of us that
[57:15] wants you and I to be so serious about
[57:18] God's word I'm not talking about
[57:20] becoming some kind of religious nut yeah
[57:23] you know some some person that everybody
[57:25] goes oh there go I'm talking about a
[57:28] person that people go there's a real
[57:30] Christian right there I tell you what
[57:32] I've I've ruffled that fella or that
[57:34] girl's feathers and I I made fun of her
[57:36] or him for doing this and that and they
[57:38] just I'm praying for you yeah amen see
[57:41] that's that's now we're getting to the
[57:44] mind of
[57:46] Christ oh no we want exact Revenge right
[57:51] away God said I'll take care of it
[57:56] didn't he see see now we're putting on a
[57:58] different mind we we realize that there
[58:00] is going to be Revenge but God will take
[58:02] care of it how is he going to take care
[58:04] of it by presenting those people with
[58:07] the same opportunity that you were
[58:09] presented and whether they accept it or
[58:11] reject it that's why we never know who
[58:13] is and who's not right now you say well
[58:17] I'm I'm I've been working on this person
[58:19] for 40 Years brother Brandon when he
[58:20] went beyond the curtain of time met a
[58:22] lady who was over 90
[58:26] now when she got there she was 18 19
[58:28] years old in the epitome of Youth and
[58:30] brother brandom didn't even recognize
[58:31] her don't you recognize her no I don't
[58:32] recognize her she was over 90 years old
[58:34] when she gave her heart to the Lord in
[58:35] one of your
[58:37] services yeah amen so all that time
[58:42] there was somebody else in there it just
[58:45] took a time and a season and the right
[58:49] word and the right Ministry to
[58:51] say guy's talking to me does he know me
[58:53] did you tell him about me yeah right see
[58:56] because automatically that's what we
[58:58] fall into y we do because we're trying
[59:01] to make a connection with the flesh when
[59:04] our connection is the soul amen the
[59:07] problem with the fall is that Lucifer
[59:11] was allowed to interrupt the spirit
[59:15] amen he won access to the Mind notice
[59:19] I'm pointing at my head but really my
[59:21] mind is is a
[59:23] spirit it's just that we're identifying
[59:26] it here and the prophet of God did
[59:28] too see it's got to come into your
[59:31] intellect
[59:33] first and then you make the decision by
[59:36] what's down in the heart for as a man
[59:38] thinketh in his heart so is he so you're
[59:41] thinking here and you're thinking here
[59:42] come on don't tell me that there's not a
[59:44] person in here that hasn't laid down in
[59:46] bed at
[59:48] night and an argument
[59:52] ensued with yourself
[59:57] I mean it could be over anything I just
[59:59] want you to understand that there's it
[1:00:01] seems like there's two of us now in
[1:00:05] closing I want you to see
[1:00:08] something God set it up so that he would
[1:00:12] himself go through the same process
[1:00:15] because he'd never asked us to do
[1:00:17] anything that he wouldn't do himself
[1:00:20] first watch now you say you're talking
[1:00:23] about God
[1:00:25] this is the god I'm talking
[1:00:27] about God created the heavens and the
[1:00:31] Earth and God
[1:00:33] said creation Universe
[1:00:39] galaxies and he made
[1:00:42] man
[1:00:46] rested things got awfully
[1:00:50] squirely they got so out of
[1:00:53] hand
[1:00:57] that his
[1:00:58] daughter allowed her
[1:01:00] intellect to
[1:01:03] interfere with God's
[1:01:07] thought now God's thought didn't stay
[1:01:09] there it didn't get contaminated it did
[1:01:11] not get uh hybrid no it can't it can't
[1:01:16] work through a
[1:01:19] contaminated
[1:01:21] pipe it's got to be clean and S ified
[1:01:25] just and and that's what sanctification
[1:01:27] is don't you want God working through
[1:01:29] you it's not a bunch of dos and don'ts
[1:01:32] it's you getting your spirit into a
[1:01:35] position where God says okay now go a
[1:01:39] little further do this you know
[1:01:42] suggestions do this do that don't do
[1:01:44] this don't do that you see we got God
[1:01:46] all
[1:01:47] wrong we think God's got a baseball bad
[1:01:50] I noticed you had one in there brother
[1:01:51] Wade but I won't bring it out no don't
[1:01:53] bring it out we we think God's got a
[1:01:55] baseball bat and he's one he's just
[1:01:57] right there at the plate waiting no one
[1:01:59] thing and whack that's the devil got us
[1:02:01] thinking
[1:02:03] that anybody ever think about
[1:02:07] this what is God a spirit that's Bible
[1:02:12] how does God appear a light that's Bible
[1:02:16] but who
[1:02:18] is God God is
[1:02:22] love see that's the part you can't
[1:02:27] see and you can't buy it that's why the
[1:02:31] prophet of God said go down to the
[1:02:32] drugstore and buy me a couple of you
[1:02:33] know couple of quarters worth of Love
[1:02:36] I'd like to have it you can't do
[1:02:38] it it's the thoughts that's what that's
[1:02:42] who God is he's love he doesn't want
[1:02:46] anybody to fail he doesn't want anybody
[1:02:49] to fall he doesn't want anybody to be
[1:02:52] lost we're making that decision amen he
[1:02:54] made his free moral aliance he said I've
[1:02:56] done this what are you going to do right
[1:02:59] I've done this what are you going to do
[1:03:02] I've done this what are you going to do
[1:03:04] well if we're going to allow God to work
[1:03:08] through us then we must let this
[1:03:12] mind which was in Christ be in
[1:03:22] us I'm looking at clocking you're
[1:03:31] good there was something that he was
[1:03:33] trying and was going to achieve and he
[1:03:36] had leten now a motive in doing it down
[1:03:40] a little further so in his great
[1:03:43] mind he he he wanted these attributes to
[1:03:48] be
[1:03:50] expressed and in him was love amen in
[1:03:54] him was to be father in him was to be
[1:03:57] son in him was to be a savior in him was
[1:04:00] to be a Healer and all these great
[1:04:02] attributes that we see already expressed
[1:04:05] they were in God Amen now we all have
[1:04:08] heard this and we all know that but
[1:04:12] without me turning to it if you went to
[1:04:14] First John 5: 7 and 8 you'd see that the
[1:04:18] father and the word are
[1:04:20] one he's a Triune being but it's not
[1:04:24] three people it's not three separate
[1:04:26] Gods it's it's and I I've said it so
[1:04:29] many times but I feel led to say it
[1:04:31] again I'm a father I'm a son and I'm me
[1:04:34] yeah
[1:04:35] right brother
[1:04:37] Boyd brother
[1:04:40] sir I'm still
[1:04:43] one you take a knife and cut me in half
[1:04:45] it's still me
[1:04:48] right Body Spirit and soul steal me am
[1:04:52] steal you
[1:04:54] right brothers and sisters it shouldn't
[1:04:57] be hard for us we're made in the image
[1:04:59] and after the likeness of God so then
[1:05:00] God also is Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:05:04] amen but guess what the really good part
[1:05:07] is all that the father was he poured
[1:05:09] into the son so that makes them 2third
[1:05:13] of
[1:05:16] one and all that the son was because the
[1:05:19] father was always already in there he
[1:05:20] poured into
[1:05:22] Christ Christ is the Holy Spirit that's
[1:05:26] available to you and me am all that God
[1:05:29] was is available to you and me what was
[1:05:32] God he was a spirit see I want you to I
[1:05:34] want to keep going over that so you'll
[1:05:37] just think about it we're trying to make
[1:05:40] an attachment we're trying to figure out
[1:05:43] God by our intellect by science by
[1:05:46] education by what we can see taste feel
[1:05:49] smell here about what we can Reason by
[1:05:50] our memory by our
[1:05:53] affection
[1:05:56] the connection is down in
[1:05:59] here and if and and as a man thinketh so
[1:06:03] is
[1:06:04] he if we don't
[1:06:08] think
[1:06:10] properly so that he can come
[1:06:13] in past all that disruption and those
[1:06:16] Gates that open and closed and get
[1:06:19] plugged up y our eyes think about it
[1:06:24] that's why I said if your eye offends me
[1:06:26] you pluck it out I don't think he
[1:06:28] literally wanted you to pluck out your
[1:06:30] eye I think he wanted you to close
[1:06:34] it he close it to those things that that
[1:06:38] draw you
[1:06:39] away well you say brother I ain't got
[1:06:42] time that's all we
[1:06:44] got I realize it's a short amount of
[1:06:47] time in the day we live in but it
[1:06:49] doesn't take but listen careful a
[1:06:52] twinkling of an eye
[1:06:55] Amen to change everything a twinkling of
[1:07:00] an eye that's the Bible amen let me
[1:07:03] finish I'm going to go over to the next
[1:07:05] page Brothers let me put my glasses
[1:07:09] on I don't know if the paragraphs will
[1:07:11] coincide with this old book but
[1:07:13] paragraph 105 says now God had a purpose
[1:07:16] and a hidden Mystery so there's two
[1:07:18] things a purpose and a hidden Mystery
[1:07:21] amen and that's what I want to speak on
[1:07:24] to the church this morning the hidden
[1:07:25] Mystery of God that he had in his mind
[1:07:29] before the world ever began and H and
[1:07:32] how that it's unfolded itself right down
[1:07:35] to this present hour that we're living
[1:07:38] in okay amen paragraph 106 he kept it a
[1:07:43] secret nobody knowed nothing about it
[1:07:46] even the angels didn't understand see he
[1:07:48] didn't reveal it that's the reason under
[1:07:50] our seventh mystery when the seventh
[1:07:52] seal was open there was silence well
[1:07:54] listen what what do you think what do
[1:07:56] you think that
[1:08:01] means who's not thinking in the room
[1:08:04] well the person that's sleeping back
[1:08:05] there but they're dreaming
[1:08:08] yeah listen who's not thinking in the
[1:08:12] room who's not using their mind how loud
[1:08:15] is
[1:08:18] it see because God is allowing You and I
[1:08:22] by the opening of that seal
[1:08:25] to get back into his thoughts and I'll
[1:08:28] close with this I can keep going but I'm
[1:08:30] gonna close
[1:08:32] listen William
[1:08:35] Shakespeare maybe the most well-known
[1:08:39] greatest most prolific playright ever
[1:08:43] known he must be everybody copies him
[1:08:45] yeah but he wants to play the part of
[1:08:47] Romeo Juliet or aell or whoever it is
[1:08:52] yeah in all of the history that I've
[1:08:55] studied about William Shakespeare I only
[1:08:57] looked it up for one reason
[1:09:01] now he
[1:09:03] never ever
[1:09:06] played one of the characters he wrote
[1:09:11] about and all of his playwrights came
[1:09:14] from his thoughts through his mind out
[1:09:18] to the end of his hand kind of like our
[1:09:21] Bible and and he began to write what he
[1:09:24] saw in his mind think about it I mean
[1:09:26] you young people how about JK Rowling
[1:09:29] maybe that would be fast forward from
[1:09:31] from Shakespeare she never played one
[1:09:35] part and and and and she's not that but
[1:09:39] something came out from her thoughts to
[1:09:42] her mind and she began to put it all
[1:09:45] down I mean where did Harry Potter come
[1:09:47] from yeah
[1:09:50] right now if you really can I can I can
[1:09:54] I say in the first seal in this act
[1:10:00] tonight that's that's a quote you you
[1:10:02] understand I got it up there but
[1:10:07] amen there's only one group of people on
[1:10:11] the
[1:10:12] planet outside of Jesus Christ that
[1:10:16] don't have to play someone else's
[1:10:21] part because if you were in and you
[1:10:24] wanted to know let's say if you were a
[1:10:26] girl and you were going to play the part
[1:10:28] of Juliet if you were a guy and you
[1:10:31] wanted to play the part of Romeo there's
[1:10:33] only one place where you could really
[1:10:35] get the inside scoop on the character
[1:10:40] and what they really represented in his
[1:10:43] writings and that was sit down with
[1:10:44] Shakespeare hey William listen buddy uh
[1:10:47] I'm going to play in and I I kind of
[1:10:49] want to you know I want to pull on you a
[1:10:51] little bit here come on
[1:10:54] did you get that I want to pull on you a
[1:10:55] little bit
[1:10:57] here that's part of the third pull we're
[1:10:59] pulling on him the Believers are pulling
[1:11:02] on him why because they want to know
[1:11:04] exactly how to be who God wants them to
[1:11:09] be so in order to do that you'll have to
[1:11:11] get into the mind and the mind is the
[1:11:14] passageway to the
[1:11:16] thoughts
[1:11:20] amen I want to know him amen
[1:11:25] you know
[1:11:26] why they all find
[1:11:30] me if you want to know him you'll find
[1:11:32] you and to me
[1:11:34] yeah that's what the message of the hour
[1:11:38] represents right it's not a battle
[1:11:41] axe it's not a
[1:11:46] toothpick it's not something some guy
[1:11:49] said I don't believe William Brandon was
[1:11:52] God right any more than I believe you
[1:11:56] are he was a representative of God being
[1:12:00] used by God to portray what was in the
[1:12:05] original thoughts of God and truthfully
[1:12:08] brother Brandon was being used as the
[1:12:11] mind of
[1:12:13] God but he realized that the mind of
[1:12:15] Christ was necessary in the hour we live
[1:12:18] in in order to receive
[1:12:22] all of the thoughts of God without
[1:12:26] anything being held back that's why I'm
[1:12:29] reading this to you right okay how long
[1:12:32] have I been up here would somebody
[1:12:34] please tell me Terrence you keep track
[1:12:35] tell
[1:12:36] me no
[1:12:40] 45 okay I I understand that's why I
[1:12:44] asked them because I knew I'd get an
[1:12:45] answer just like I'd
[1:12:50] give brothers and sisters there's so
[1:12:52] much more
[1:12:55] I mean I I'm not the only person that's
[1:12:57] God has called to try to do everything
[1:13:01] in his power to express it to you but
[1:13:03] you have
[1:13:05] access you have access to the same but
[1:13:07] but we have to put away our old
[1:13:10] selves you're listen young people you're
[1:13:14] dying don't tell me that you're dying
[1:13:17] right I was young like you once but
[1:13:19] you're dying it's just going slower
[1:13:22] right now the food you eat is rebuilding
[1:13:25] yourselves to make you feel young and
[1:13:27] vibrant but let me tell you something
[1:13:30] you stick around here long
[1:13:33] enough see because I want it to be
[1:13:36] real don't waste your
[1:13:39] youth that's my only regret is that I
[1:13:43] God called me at about 21 and 3/4 years
[1:13:46] old I wish he'd had called me at two
[1:13:50] yeah seriously amen what why because the
[1:13:54] scar
[1:13:55] tissue is
[1:13:57] immense right let me tell you the most
[1:14:00] powerful weapon that Lucifer's
[1:14:03] got is your
[1:14:05] memory because see he called when he got
[1:14:08] to Eve he
[1:14:11] said and God said he was pulling on what
[1:14:16] she
[1:14:17] knew about what God
[1:14:20] Said but she didn't read enough
[1:14:24] she didn't pray enough she relied too
[1:14:27] much on her outer senses and when he
[1:14:30] said God has said surely thou shout man
[1:14:33] there's some shouting go it should be a
[1:14:34] Pentecostal meting but not
[1:14:37] oh oh can't accept that because in my
[1:14:41] memory I remember that's not what God
[1:14:44] Said God said it this way and brother
[1:14:47] bam told us when those five gates work
[1:14:50] for the word of God that's right brother
[1:14:53] you got it going on but as soon as one
[1:14:57] of those Gates begins to work against
[1:15:01] God's word stop right
[1:15:02] there let your free moral agency let
[1:15:05] your self-will rise up and say listen
[1:15:07] here partner now you're talking to
[1:15:10] yourself listen here

[1:15:15] think we're
[1:15:16] nuts but look at the world Amen they
[1:15:20] think they's somebody else I don't
[1:15:21] understand how anybody puts any
[1:15:23] credibility in Hollywood not one actor
[1:15:26] actress why because they're playing
[1:15:28] somebody
[1:15:31] else God's letting you and me have the
[1:15:35] opportunity to play ourselves please

[1:15:44] word it's the
[1:15:47] best it's the best here let me cut to
[1:15:50] the chase I'm going to read you two
[1:15:51] paragraphs while you're standing and

[1:15:55] listen to this part now right here he
[1:15:57] says uh this Brothers is uh paragraph
[1:15:59] 209 and then comes the revelation of the
[1:16:01] mystery remember he had a
[1:16:04] purpose one of them was a hidden Mystery
[1:16:07] then comes the revelation of the mystery
[1:16:08] to reveal what it's all been
[1:16:13] about where these little doctrines like
[1:16:15] Luther brought catechism and everything
[1:16:17] else and Wesley brought this that and
[1:16:18] the other and these other things and
