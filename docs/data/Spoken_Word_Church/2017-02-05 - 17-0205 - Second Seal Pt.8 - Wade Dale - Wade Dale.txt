========================================

what'd I just say I didn't listen that's what I figured that's a good one and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it was a noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see I saw him be held a white horse and he that sat on him had a bowl and the crown was given unto him went forth conquering and to conquer now remember that was the first seal that was the white horse rider that was that white righteous church and then we see though the symbolics that we have to take the revelation of those seals is the seven Thunders that John didn't write is that are we getting out yes she said boy that's not in there okay well if if somebody check on it Bob who just come in well no oh okay um if you want mine just go straight in there until he gets there and if he doesn't get there then I'll deal with that later when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast they come and see so we're the first seal was we saw white righteous church we saw um all these things that happened in the natural form right but then we come and brought the layer of the onion peel back again and we peeled a little more of the onion off and felt that it had a spiritual application for you and I right right and that's something that we got to catch because the Written Letter has not changed one person yet okay so we're looking at the between the lines what God is saying to us and we know that the prophet of God spent that last three and a half years of his message trying to explain the seals because the seals you can't preach the seals in six six nine seven nines eight nines it had to be a development of time all the way through to bring the message out all right because remember even when we get in the seventh seal he said it opened in a threefold Marin they didn't all open on the same day that's right right and there was one unknown which we know that when he preached Christ the mystery God revealed that he brought all the seals together and showed Christ a mystery of God it said he said revealed so if it's revealed it's revealed right yes okay so we know that it was revealed through the ministry of William Branham not just one sermon or two or three or four all right and you say well do you throw away 47 no 47 to 63 is the foundation of the house you're building 47 to 1963 was a work of restoration we talked about it last night that was a work of restoration brother Brown didn't come to Branson you Holy Ghost he didn't even tell us how to live right he wasn't the first one to tell us how to live right the Bible already told us how to live right what we had done is man had just put their hand over it and took their own revelation of it so man had closed the book back so we see now that the book in Revelations 10 7 that the mighty Angel comes down with the book open all right yeah so he opened the book and he revealed what the seven sealed not just not just in I say eight sermons because remember he preached the questions and answers um and truly that that's not a mistake um brother Dale's preached it many times and I've attempted it a few times that there's always an interval between six and seven right you have six seals and then you have an interval you have six you have six Church ages and then there's an interval that's Pentecostal age that we were talking about there's an interval in there that always came himself then you got six trumpets then there's a Chapter whole chapter inserted in between that so we see that the same thing happened now he's between the sixth and the seventh seal brother round stopped on the sixth sale had questions and answers the next morning then he preached the seventh seal that night so there's always a gap or an interval to want to I think it's to catch everything up to bring everything up and kind of do a summation of the six because it's really only six seals right because Christ is the seven he preached six seals in Matthew 24 he didn't preached seven the seventh was standing there if they would have known that son of man who he was then they would have known that was The Headstone but they didn't know they knew he was the Cornerstone because he said he was you know the Bible of course when I say he he wrote the Bible okay so the Bible said that amen for winning it opened now the second seal we've been on it come and see another horse that was red power was giving him a settlement to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and they've given him a great story all right so now we've showed the work of what the odds he was given a sword or a word the red was blood and then Sanctified and we wrote body in there because we are to be Sanctified daily in our walk with God now we're going to read some about sanctification in the Bible so excuse me the second seal to me shows the first deal shows one true Lamb of God the second seal and even right up to the fourth seal shows us how our Redemption comes because remember the Rapture takes place on the fourth seal all right everybody got there after it takes place on the fourth still why there's no more there's no more uh line Ox Manor Eagle there's no more horse riders there's no more uh there's honestly there's no more holding up for the Gentiles that's right once the door of the Gentile church is closed there's not nothing going to be saved so them four horse riders that help us out the wine Ops man and Eagle is the Holy Ghost for your age and it's going to go because brother Ryan will tell you in the fifth sealed he said we know that the Raptor takes place in the force Hill because we don't see any horse riders anymore we don't see any beasts anymore so therefore the church had to take a Rapture you say well what's five six and seven if you don't get five six and seven you don't go out and four minutes that's a little confusing but you think about it if you don't get five six and seven to me five six and seven is the Apex are the uh the the change of the body the the culmination and we'll look at that because you got to break them back into one two three and four because we all got a break down here that's right okay but the Rapture take place on the four seal people go Haywire but we're that's why we're here so we can all learn together and when brother Brown does say that you don't you know war in your mind you say well five six and sevens to the Jews listen if we don't get the seventh seal broke here on the earth we're gonna take a body change because the seventh seal himself is the one that took a body change right right so if we have the son of man ministry that's what I'm trying to tell you you know the last few Sundays that son of man Ministry is if it if it's here I'm asking you that I know it is but if that Sunland Ministry is here it's got to act the same way it acted when the flesh man was standing here on Earth got to if not then we go back to the church ages to where well is it this or is there two or is it three or is it baptism and father son or is it this or if that or or now come up to the message where we see now the message is breaking the word apart the people in the so-called message breaking the word apart right right um number one they killed the influence of the messenger so the whole message is wrong my brother that was talking about last night if you can discredit brother around being out there when they when the cloud came versus what they wrote in Life Magazine then your number one calling him a liar number two you're saying that that never happened right the day was never met by any angel or met by any thing and that he's just making up this story yeah well I said it it it's uh it's it's [Music] I just don't understand but but you won't under you won't understand you want to understand if you don't have logo okay that's right there's some things you won't be able to see but we've come to a development now to where everything's got to be faster everything's accelerated we're learning more we should be to the fact of where when brother Dale comes out today and brings out what he's going to bring out we should be able to now whether we see it or not or understand it right at the moment that's okay but you see where that has to happen there's things has to happen to go in place right amen so um just like I said when I when I preached out about 1977 um we got to look at a marker because I was thinking last night because some had said well okay go past 20 swings it's going to go past 2026. do you know that time still continues until until the lights are on judgment so if we say if 2026 or 27 when the world's destroyed right the the millenniums ushered in it's going to be 30 26 Before Time ends so time's going to continue on out but there are there's a place to where that's why that that I think that God says okay I'm going to let this thing run but I'm going to pick a bribe remember he comes as a thief in the night I'm gonna put I'm going to pick a bride up right out of that and let it just continue on and brother Brown said they'll even keep going to church thinking they're getting the Holy Ghost thinking the words being preached to them now that's message people too that's right right yeah so there must be something real secret about it I mean because everybody in the Bronx look at everybody sorry everybody in the message is looking for a Rapture that's right soon you know denominations can put it off and I know sometimes we have that thought of putting it off it ain't gonna happen in my time but uh I think we're supposed to call for it I thought Israel called for um a redeemer to get them out of Israel I don't think they were going well I think we'll just be another 34 years I kind of like it here no but you know what we do like it here and that's why we do have a problem with dates and times and season yes that's right and and we get unsettled but why should we be unsettled this is not our home this is not where we're supposed to this is not the condition that we're supposed to be in so what's inside of us should be yearning for something else right that's just my whole and listen we're all humans that's right sorry we're all humans we we don't want to leave the comfort of our home or leave the comfort of our car leave the comfort of our job but one day folks brother Brown said your job will mean nothing that's right that's nothing that's right and I've been reading and I'm going to bring it out now brother now's going to preach this afternoon because of I really appreciate what he's bringing about the the dates and what's coming up that that's proven by the 6 000 years and the 3 000 years is give to the Jews so I told him listen I didn't allow him to preach he's allowing me to preach on the afternoon I just give it back to him for a while I wanted him to finish it so he wouldn't have to review so much next Sunday yeah because you in seven days you'll miss yeah and brother now so gracious to go back and review well well we're going to get a double barrel today of him so but I've been reading in the scripture where Jesus said I didn't come to bring peace that's right he said I come to bring division between mother and father sister brother mother-in-law sister-in-law he brought it all the way down and he said if you don't take up your cross and follow me he said you're not of me that's right you think Jesus was some soft-spoken I don't think so Liars your father's different than mine he told that one man he said go tell that fox yeah talking about Harry Harry they told him to be they told him to beware of Herod because he was he was you know kind of he was he pulled a quick deal and that's what Jesus said hey look at that little fox I ain't worried about him I ain't worried about him right but that's what we've come under now this is what we've come under where where we see that every message is important everything's important um the sales are important um the the 1970 weeks all that is really a foundation yes to raise us up into this I think the most glorious message in in the world because no one listen when we excuse me when we get up there to the other side John saw this and wrote it but he didn't understand it no one you understand what I'm saying no one on this Earth except the last day bride of Jesus Christ and William Branham understands the seal no one that's right no one fully understood it exactly right but what a great thing now we can understand it if we if brother Brown said the rapping Faith lives in the books and cakes and we got to get in them and uh let it be part of our life yes is that all right so that's our commission our commission is to take a body change not to give it to another not to give it to another age that's right there is no other age that's right we're either going down or up no continuation down or up one of them all right there's no I think I'll just stay neutral no yeah like Jesus said he said yeah the kingdom of God's taken by force you got to take it it's yours he said the kingdom of God if you'll really read in the Bible Matthew Mark Luke and John the daily life of Jesus you'll see how they had a problem with him being the son of man because they did not understand they knew that there was Jehovah God that was so pure that nobody can understand that he was so high that he would come down in a cloud and he'd have to speak through uh you know Moses or something you know and there was a large separation so Jesus comes down here and he just acts like the rest of them really they called him a wine beaver a glutton he must like to eat and drink wine right that you know he said you call me that and then they called him belzebub so did I am I saying he lived a horrible life no he lived this life that we're supposed to live but he was the most UN misunderstood person that ever was on the face of this Earth so we should be the most misunderstood people on the face of the Earth how do we can live a good life and live a good full Christian Life but yet be the son of man made manifest in the end time amen all right without the without the um the the great signs and wonders in one person right and one person it's not gonna be in one person anymore so it's going to be individually to just make it through this age you and I are going to have to have that same Ministry inside of us to get through because that's what got Jesus Through amen and got him through the through the world now the world wasn't near as bad then as it is now that's right I mean all the demons were after Jesus because there wasn't no other Holy Ghost people so then we go after but now you got all this multiplication of God and and you know Satan's trying his best to get it back down you know to get it back down again but he's not going to be able to because we do take a Rapture that's why I want you to see today we do take a Rapture in the four seal so there is something going to happen to a group of people that's right they're going to lift off this Earth but we're not going to lift off this Earth without some One Two Three or ten or a hundred people gonna have to stand one day and say this is them that's right because I want to show you something about sanctification just in this form that we haven't seen that we have scriptures we haven't read so we know that that we see that in the church ages the first three Ages was the first seal right the lion the lion of the tribe of Judah the boldness of God all the there was no denomination in this age right they were forming once right remember it was the same then it become a deed then it became a doctor amen then it becomes incarnate in the person all right so the same way here we see that this was you know they didn't teach three gods or water baptism father son Holy Ghost only till 606 A.D at the 19 Council did they start converting people that's why they had a hard time this age is the ox age of Colombia they were killed because they were called they were Christians just to be a Christian brother Brown said you knew you were going to automatically die right kind of horrible but that's the way it was okay because they pulled away from the Catholic church but the Catholic Church became so much in power they killed 68 million Jews or 16 million Jews 68 million Protestants and that same devil killed 6.8 million Jews in the Holocaust so it's the same one but that's where you get your red blood and what was what was God doing he was sanctifying a group of people okay all right because I believe the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved all right now that won't work in this age to the fullness you hear when I say it to the fullness that won't work in this age because being justified will not put you in the body now but see but but God has moved up right the word's been opened more well the forward's been opened we just got to get we just got to quit closing the book God keeps opening it we keep closing it okay so the second seal now let's read John 17 and watch what Jesus said John 17 17. [Applause] sanctify them through thy truth what is truth that word okay that's what I'm going to preach on next Sunday is it's not that but it's going to be show us the father that was his whole deal of being on the Earth was to show the father not show himself right so that's what me see that's when we when we interject you in it or you when you point your point your fingers yourself when you interject you in it you're not showing the father right right so that's what he done he came to do thy will father if it be thy will let this cup pass for me but nevertheless thou will be done see Mary even said the same thing Mary yielded and said thy will be done in other words what you said that's what's going to happen how simple is that but she accepted it with no there was no stipulation in there okay sanctify them through that truth that word is true now that word sanctify in the strong means to make holy to purify or consecrate to venerate or Hollow be holy be holy sanctify all right to render or acknowledge or to be venerable or hallow to separate from profane things and dedicate to God consecrate things to God dedicate people to God to purify cleanse externally now we know that externally you can't clean yourself up enough [Music] um so you got to do what she says to purify internally by renewing of the Soul so that the outside person can be clean right I I want to really get on that one day that that we always point to this but really are we pointing to this this flesh we know it came born in sin shape and iniquity had to come here that way yes because of the fall but is it really dirty as far as God says dirty I thought we was going to live in a flesh body for eternity right right I thought that's what we're going to live in that's what I was talking about Sunday about the glorified body when John when when when Jesus reeks down and touched John down uh alapapolis and he was preaching he touched John with his right hand he touched him with a glorified body in other words I've got a glorified body and I'm going to give you glorified body it's just not going to come till the church ages are over but I'm going to give you one in other words he didn't have a problem listen yeah I don't think he got that Sunday he didn't have a problem touching that flesh man of John okay he didn't go over there and go now John you're dirty that's right the Bible said he took his right hand and laid it on John he didn't have a problem with connecting to the flesh our problem and I'll read it next Sunday Jesus said our problem is not what goes in where art comes out it's what proceeds from here out that's right so what is it your vocal cords don't say one thing unless your soul and spirit tells what it tell you what to do your body don't do once your body does not sin everybody says no we sin in our bodies let's not well if we thought that for 50 something years and it hadn't worked let's start thinking other ways you don't sin with your body okay your body is just an uh a capsule that you're sowing your spirits in that's right is that right right your body don't sin unless what's inside of it tells it what to do that's right so who's doing this in it that's right that's Spirit realm that Spirit realm is the hardest thing to get Hey Brother the hardest thing to get rid of and you can't get rid of it you got to clean it up because watch he said you sanctify From the Inside Out go ahead yes sir no I was going to say that you can take that in the physical for example um anything that you might have on your skin for example acne let's just say acne acne is not an issue of the outside of of the skin itself it's actually something from from within right and that's what doctors would say you know right anything that comes out on the outside is just showing that something's wrong inside right therefore do something inside in order for the skin to stop showing whatever right you can take that that way too you know in the spiritual you know but if the soul is right is wrong the outside is going to be wrong yeah you're gonna have swords and that's why leprosy is a type of sin a top you know it's not it's not sin in itself right right but it is a it signifies because it comes from the body comes from whatever happens to the person that has leprosy yes so I I don't want us to say well well I'm sinless but Paul's already told us that we're already raptured sitting in Heavenly places in our soul right now if you get a cut on your hand does it heal back up yes the problem our problem is is when God cursed the ground everything we eat that comes out of the ground is what's cursed so our soul didn't come out of the ground our spirit didn't come out of the ground no all right our body came out of the ground right that's the problem is that we live under a sand curve but are we Sinners because we're in flesh bodies I don't think so we're not Sinners because we're in flesh bodies we're Sinners because the inside person is not being cleaned or Sanctified that's right that's one day we're going to stand on people and we're going to realize what's already inside of us if you're born again and you have these virtues working in your life and The Headstone is revealed to you you're just as Eternal as God is and God's just going to change your body brother Brown said what what is this great chain all you gotta just a change so he said just change so we're looking for something I think that's that's already there we're looking for something out there that's going to get this thing better we know this thing's dying we know it stinks we know it if we don't take care of it it will Rock and it is still rotting but these seals to me instead of just showing that I'm Sanctified on the inside I've got to start believing and confessing because remember Jesus never never he never in all four chapters he never said oh this wretched body that I live in no yeah yeah did he no no he knew he was brought subject to the to the to the sin of the world because he knew he was getting older right I mean he was in his 30s and looked 50. there's no denying that but he never once oh Father I'm sorry that you had to put me in this human body oh Lord why did you put me in Father why'd you he never said that he never denied why he was there but he never belittled his flesh because that's what they're asking me we'll read it next Sunday they said oh what's this and this and this he said why are you worried about what you're eating oh I know what it is because the Pharisees and we don't get anywhere today the Pharisees come to him and said your disciples eat without washing their hands right they're eaten with unclean ham Jesus said it ain't what's on the outside right you see it he said there's what's on the inside that's right that's right it comes out he said in other words he didn't go now y'all disciples y'all go bring this wash your hands that's right no he never said that he just belittled the Pharisees for looking at the little things and you know and they went through one day and ate the corn on the Sabbath day they didn't go Harvest it they walked through the field and picked it and ate it that's what I'm saying this way if you look from this way back that way you go well he was profaning the Sabbath but he wasn't there is no law that you can't eat on the Sabbath you just can't go out and harvest it on the Sabbath and they weren't harvesting they were eating and as they were walking through the field right you remember back in Ruth and Boaz the Bible's perfect amen they always left the corner of the fields right remember that's what Ruth was doing she was leaning in the corner they would cut their field and they cut it in a circle but they'd leave those corners for the poor and the people coming through the Wayfair The Stranger coming through they leave and that's what somebody had done they had left the cornfield when the corners not cut and they were going through eating the corn because they were hungry Jesus said have you not read that David actually went in the temple that's right he went in it now he didn't go in in the holy of holies he went in that second Court though and ate the shoe bread that was in the bowl him and his Warriors yes yes and I bet they didn't wash their hands either no but Jesus was telling him says well are you straining tonight and swallow a camel you know you're right right so what I'm saying is is I believe this the message of the hour we'll listen we'll never deny that this thing we live in is dying we know it is but now if your soul was born again it's not it never did die never have I never will die that's right never will get older never will sin never will say anything wrong it's in that Spirit realm of what we go to work with right memory reason conscious affection you write them five down and look at them every day and you say there's my enemy that's right yeah it's my memory my conscience of who I am and the and the devil telling me who I am that's right reasoning imagination there's no imagination in God that's right and then the love or or or that that we know that that's not the love of God love God's in the soul is your faith or doubt that's right right brother Brian said you love with your spirit that's what he's saying right but we got to take that spirit that we love with that we you say oh I love this I love to eat I love it most unused word in the world because true agape love is is the love of God and nothing else feel your love is what we have for our family and our children and our life and all that for the for the natural world and and I believe that was set up because of the of the dimensions when God separated himself in Genesis 3 15 he said I'll put him into your division dimension between me and you but I'm going to make a way because I'm going to come through all them come down here as a baby and I'm going to come back as the woman's seed and I'm going to bring you right back here in that Redemption Redemption is not replacement it's not going back to another Garden it's going right back position all right so let's just start thinking that don't and listen fine line though you can't walk around and say I'm so perfect I can't do anything wrong or we're in the Millennium and all that stuff that people are preaching now let's let's don't do that I know that I'm a sinner saved by grace but if I'm saved I ain't necessary no more right right [Music] we're going to see that our problem is not in our flesh My Flesh has no problem at all it just holds everything it's inside that inside of me is what I got to work on that's true that thing that starts running around in my brain call my reasoning yeah right my consciousness of things sure we're supposed to be Sanctified but watch let's read this right here Ephesians 5 let's go to verse 19 right here and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also may be might be Sanctified what through the truth so the truth is the only thing now listen let's stop right there the truth has nothing to do with your body your body is false already it's contrary right yes it's contrary because it came the wrong way right but through the truth of what's inside I just believe one day it's going to be one day we're gonna just say the prince of this world is coming has nothing nothing in me oh sure you say well I had this bad dog come on if Jesus listen if Jesus was so human that brother Brown said he was tempted then what how is the temptation it's not from this this fulfills the Temptation you understand this fulfills the Temptation that's right what is the Temptation your memory Jesus was tempted with women so the tempter would come but he didn't entertain that thought that's right that's our problem we entertain that thought if you just say don't worry about that let's don't worry about that all right let's go let's go to Ephesians 5 26. I want to see this fish is good right here everybody all right don't don't say brother Dale bro Wade tells you that you can do anything in the world in your flesh you know no but I'm telling you that whatever you do ain't your flesh that's right why were we given this body we solve it right you don't hear my soul knocking on there but my soul's inside of there telling me to do that that's true right right okay we'll we'll understand something maybe one thing today that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by what the word now watch that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without let me see blemish now that's down here it's going to be real easy to do that there it's true somebody got to do it here before we go there that's right or like we were talking about Sunday you look what's on our shoulders we got to bring all that sixth Dimension here every person that died with the baptism my holy ghost from Paul's day or not from Paul but from the day of Pentecost not Azusa Street Pentecost 80 30 Pentecost from 80 30 Pentecost to the day we take a change that sixth Dimension has got to empty into this Dimension that's right and somebody has got to have the power to bring them here that's right and we're still going to listen that's why I'm telling you we still going to be in flesh bodies reads Ephesians downstairs descend from heaven will shout course and Archangel truffle God the dead in Christ shall rise first so they're going to rise all in spirits no no glory of my body that's right and then we which are alive and remain shall be changed that's right break it brother right there is the whole thing we just got too many blemishes by the way oh lordy come on that's what the devil told you that's what she want men to love their wives because their own bodies he that loves his wife loves himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes it cherishes it even as a word amen board does the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bone slash and Bone Flash and Bone he has no problem saying flesh and Bone all right because he's talking about true right here he's bringing it to a husband and wife and and feel your love but that's not feel your love right that's agape love amen right there this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church he's gonna cross his in flesh now and he's going to have a flesh church amen amen so I may have to go by the grave or for purification somebody's going to stand here and say this body that I'm standing in has no hold on me none all right we're going to read some next Sunday where Jesus even talks about now he doesn't say all power Heaven on Earth is given unto me he doesn't say that until he gets to the after his glorification and after his a body changing after his resurrection but you'll see he says something here on Earth that's really profound and I got it there at the house when we will read it next Sunday Lord with him all right Hebrews 13 12 we always read Hebrews 13 8. let's read Hebrews 13 12. see what God says basketball 12 13. I love this app let's start verse 12. wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate now remember he was taken out to Golgotha he wasn't he wasn't killed in the city of Jerusalem they took him out all right excuse me now what did he do he Sanctified the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continue that is the fruit of what our lips flesh giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well placed then you keep reading obeying them to have a rule over you but he's talking about Jesus Christ by his own blood Sanctified a group of people already remember it was it was done at Calvary but we just got to believe it right I mean listen what is our what is our greatest fear except that you're not born again what's our greatest fear that we'll do something in our flesh you will never do anything in your flesh that you don't want to do inside sure you'll be motivated but you the one that pulled the trigger he may put the gun in your hand or he may tell you everything's sweet and happy I'm talking about the devil everything's great but you got to say remember one brother around him says you sin as a Christian Satan can't come and make you sin you have to go out that's right that's what he's saying and that's profound because you have to go out to do the Senate what go out from here out that's right not go out where you gotta I'm in the room now I gotta go out no he means from here right out right from here through the filter of the spirit into the Flesh and then the flesh does what the spirit tells it to do the flesh can do nothing except what the spirit tells it today that's right yes sever somebody's spine that body ain't gonna ever do anything but you know what if he's not a Christian he's just as dirty right come on he's just if he's not a Christian if he's not born again and installed he's done for that's right right you still all the man never sinned in his life he never touched nobody he never done anything because he's paralyzed what am I telling you he's got all those things in his soul in his Spirit that's dealing with whether the body can work or not that's true is that all right that's right we got to live in this thing people but my greatest enemy is what goes on in my head not what goes on in my hands yes because I don't want that to come down manifest here yeah that's right amen because that same devil still comes but he has it's like it's like Jesus said he said the prince of this world come to ask nothing to me he comes he didn't say he won't leave he won't you know bother you he said he'll come that's right but I thought when the when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God's supposed to want to raise up a standard yeah and that standard is inside of you not your well I didn't do that because I just didn't touch it oh come on mm-hmm what did the Pharisees what did Jesus tell Pharisees he said if you don't touch a girl you say you've not committed adultery with it he said but I say unto you whatever you think in your heart you've already went to bed with her in other words you've already done what you so what's the flesh got let's go listen brother Dale today he's got something powerful for him well he does everything
