[35:21] in you and abound they make you that ye
[35:25] shall neither be barren nor unfruitful
[35:27] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[35:30] Christ I mean you may be seated the Lord
[35:34] at his blessing to the reading of the
[35:36] word brother Tony and him doesn't have
[35:50] any arrangements yet so we will get to
[35:54] that when the arrangements were made
[35:56] okay
[35:57] now I've been speaking on trying to get
[36:04] us to the position to where we could
[36:07] follow in the the lineup of
[36:10] understanding the stature of a perfect
[36:13] man all right and doing that we're
[36:16] trying to date to move a little bit into
[36:18] it and you know if you get bored of me
[36:21] speaking about these things evidently
[36:24] they're not as invaluable as valuable to
[36:27] you as they are to me so because that's
[36:31] the thing that that I want to make sure
[36:34] or that we all understand but now I'm
[36:38] not saying this and or no reflections or
[36:40] nothing's nothing to me because you'll
[36:42] hear me say things sometimes that you
[36:46] wonder why I say them but I'm just plain
[36:48] and I'm just blunt so that's the best
[36:51] way to be and that way you don't
[36:53] misunderstand me see there was a
[36:55] doctrine back years ago on second Peter
[36:59] of the stature of a perfect man and the
[37:02] doctrine was that you did not have these
[37:05] virtues you could not get these virtues
[37:09] until
[37:10] you know you would not be born again
[37:13] until you reach the height of the statue
[37:15] of a perfect man and receives a
[37:18] headstone well I've never been able to
[37:21] follow that I'm serious
[37:25] I don't argue with nobody back oh they
[37:28] know been native arguing it's not gonna
[37:29] solve any time will I bless God I got my
[37:32] point across well then you know you know
[37:35] what you're doing you got your point
[37:36] across what good is it you know what but
[37:41] there weren't that doctrine went among
[37:43] the people of the message and is still
[37:45] prevalent especially in the overseas
[37:50] feel that these things are still being
[37:54] taught and they've put out a lot of
[37:55] different points on it but I've tried to
[37:59] make my stand at that time to the same
[38:01] that I do now I believe what the Prophet
[38:05] taught us you know because that's the
[38:09] only way that we had to know what things
[38:12] are is by the prophets message that he
[38:16] has brought unto us and then that way
[38:19] you know we come to a place of having
[38:22] understanding and we've spent a couple
[38:26] of messages talking about one especially
[38:28] on how that we Peter is saying to these
[38:34] people here that I have this faith and
[38:39] I'm addressing this to people that has
[38:42] that faith so whatever faith Peter had
[38:46] he's addressing the message to the
[38:49] people that have that same faith so then
[38:52] you say well we don't have the faith of
[38:54] the Apostles well why not you know why
[38:58] not why can't we say we have the faith
[39:01] of the Apostles all right now Heights
[39:04] and growth and development adoptions and
[39:07] things like that or different things our
[39:10] way of progressiveness but everybody
[39:14] must be born again there's no way of
[39:18] bypassing any of these things all right
[39:22] and I
[39:23] tried to get you to see and we'll we'll
[39:26] make it this away this morning to where
[39:28] you see where I'm heading
[39:30] I believe that Peter and Paul brother
[39:33] branham said preach the same thing now
[39:37] if you take Paul and read him he covers
[39:39] a lot of thoughts in pre destinations
[39:42] and uncovering the Romans you know of
[39:46] the adoptions and things and he covers
[39:50] it in that line whereas Peter covers it
[39:53] in this growth development or the
[39:55] stature are what we need to have to
[39:59] bring these things into manifestation
[40:02] what I believe that I believe that Paul
[40:05] and Peter preached the same thing I
[40:07] believe brother Branham preached what
[40:08] they did you know I believe he brought
[40:12] to us the understanding that Paul and
[40:16] Peter was bringing are trying to bring
[40:19] back guard alright and in doing that
[40:22] then I believe that to be and I believe
[40:25] then true that by the Prophet bringing
[40:28] that message to us you know all right
[40:31] then we can move on in the Lord and it
[40:35] will we'll finalize in the finishing up
[40:38] with these things one day in the rapture
[40:40] all right and believing then the
[40:43] fivefold ministry is according to what
[40:46] the Bible says and the Prophet said it's
[40:49] for the perfecting of the saints or
[40:50] bringing these virtues into the body of
[40:53] Christ I believe that and that that puts
[40:56] it to her that we have a five fold
[40:59] ministry as the Prophet said these young
[41:00] men take this and sweep it on to the
[41:04] coming of the Lord
[41:05] all right now I've heard a your lot of
[41:11] you listen to a lot of things on him but
[41:13] I don't but some people every once in a
[41:15] while send me a tape and I listen and
[41:17] things and I heard one man on a tape car
[41:20] and he was emphatically declaring that
[41:24] he believed in the fivefold ministry and
[41:27] he believed it cause he was part of the
[41:30] fivefold ministry all right
[41:32] yes oh well that's good then but then I
[41:35] played another time
[41:36] with a sign man preaching another time
[41:39] and he said brother Branham was the
[41:42] fivefold ministry well now I don't know
[41:47] which one he's saying to be right I'm
[41:50] just telling you you need to listen to
[41:52] what you're listening to you might find
[41:55] out if you listen a little while you
[41:56] might find out these people are saying a
[41:59] lot of things you don't understand but
[42:00] that ain't gonna do it because it
[42:02] doesn't matter to me it wouldn't matter
[42:05] to me if every minister in this message
[42:08] declared that we had to only play the
[42:11] types of the Prophet you know in the
[42:14] services that wouldn't change me that
[42:19] wouldn't change me none whatsoever post
[42:20] on I believe in the fivefold ministry
[42:22] but I believe now this is what I do
[42:26] believe you know I believe brother
[42:29] Branham could fulfill any office in the
[42:33] film industry I believe that because of
[42:36] the position he was in and what he was
[42:39] doing and he done those things he done
[42:41] everything he said it was even a deacon
[42:43] he said he was he was everything and he
[42:46] could do those things
[42:47] I believe that all right but then after
[42:51] his passing on now it's delivered to the
[42:53] ministry to where the minister is to
[42:56] take that and only preach what he
[42:58] preached all right so then that gets
[43:01] into the category with a lot of things
[43:02] going on today that you don't agree with
[43:05] you know but that's all right what does
[43:07] it matter what does it make any
[43:09] difference who police want whether later
[43:12] that you know they believe this they
[43:14] believe what do you believe and I think
[43:18] we were to just stand on what we believe
[43:20] and say that that's it you know good or
[43:23] bad as far as is doing and I believe
[43:27] then that there is to be in this last
[43:30] days of finishing up of all things all
[43:33] right then we'll read that this morning
[43:35] when we get down to it of what the
[43:37] Prophet said but I want you to think
[43:40] about what we were talking about that
[43:44] Peter said of those of like precious
[43:47] faith
[43:50] in other words he said I've got it we
[43:51] read it from the profit I've got this
[43:53] faith and I'm addressing this to those
[43:56] that have this fight well now that's
[43:58] what's your prophet say it well I don't
[44:01] believe so I don't care what you believe
[44:03] I'm you ask me say brother what do you
[44:05] think this is what the Prophet says it
[44:07] so that solves it with me I don't have
[44:10] any ain't gonna argue with you about it
[44:12] but you ask me I will just tell you what
[44:14] do you think we have the faith of the
[44:16] father's I believe in the Bride of
[44:18] Christ somewhere around the world is the
[44:19] faith of the father because according to
[44:22] the Bible and according to the Prophet
[44:26] it has never been to a position to where
[44:29] that God ever left the earth there has
[44:33] always been God dwelling among mankind
[44:36] and no matter what you would say about
[44:39] what I don't think this is isn't it
[44:41] that ain't got none do it Hebrews 13:8
[44:43] said he's the same yesterday today and
[44:45] forever so then he said he ever was here
[44:48] he's still here
[44:49] alright now that's Bible that's what I
[44:53] was telling my wife the other day I
[44:54] don't understand people you know I
[44:56] thought the Bible said you know and I
[45:00] thought that was what it was supposed to
[45:01] be I thought that was what is far well
[45:04] how come as quick as you see these
[45:06] people backslide you know quick as you
[45:09] see them turn against the message what
[45:11] do they do they start cutting the hair
[45:14] painting the face and wearing the wrong
[45:16] clothes and going to the world men and
[45:18] women why do you do that the Bible tells
[45:24] us not to do that well I had a prophet
[45:28] he the probably left me a word he met
[45:30] you love he told you what the Bible says
[45:33] the Bible wide it is it shows there's
[45:36] something wrong with the interior part
[45:39] of the being that is making the things
[45:42] and they're just going and showing they
[45:44] should they ought to walk out a long
[45:46] time before then but they stayed with it
[45:49] to to where as long as it was working
[45:51] and then they got their own things and
[45:53] then how they ought to end the Prophet
[45:55] was wrong here the Prophet was wrong
[45:56] dark you know this will well all right I
[45:59] think I'd have to do with Loula Georgia
[46:02] and he's got nothing to do with what I
[46:03] believe cuz I believe the message
[46:07] because that's what I want you to think
[46:09] about today Paul and Peter said the same
[46:14] thing brother Branham said to sign time
[46:17] Paul and Peter said would you agree all
[46:21] right now the fivefold ministry is
[46:23] supposed to say the same thing the
[46:25] Prophet said now I agree with one thing
[46:28] that there's a lot of people that called
[46:30] herself thoughtful ministry I'm not
[46:33] gonna put them in any category of trying
[46:35] to say they're following what the
[46:37] Prophet said now I'm with you now
[46:40] whether we don't still go throw stones
[46:42] cause remember either throw he that
[46:45] lives in glass house but he that lives
[46:48] in glass house don't throw stones that's
[46:50] a pretty good way of doing it all right
[46:52] but see Peter was saying I have this
[46:57] faith and I'm delivering this to people
[47:01] that have this same faith
[47:03] all right now that solves the problem
[47:06] then you said well is there ever there
[47:09] has never been an age now listen there
[47:14] has never been an age that God was not
[47:17] in that age right come on now there's
[47:23] never been an age that God wouldn't in
[47:24] that age there's never been an age that
[47:27] it was not the Holy Ghost in each
[47:29] searching there's never been an age that
[47:31] there wasn't a group of people that had
[47:34] the Neuwirth I'm talking about after
[47:37] calvary i have to receive an old ago
[47:39] coming down it's never been an age it's
[47:41] always been the baptism with Holy Ghost
[47:43] in their age and those of like precious
[47:46] faith right so they had the same faith
[47:52] Peter had now not the growth development
[47:54] that's the thing we'll have to get
[47:56] through not the growth development of
[47:59] what Peter in them was doing but the
[48:02] same faith the same new birth I listened
[48:06] over a couple of times to the last
[48:07] messages and I was driving hard and I'm
[48:10] driving hard now if you have the new
[48:13] birth if you have the bad
[48:16] when the Holy Ghost this day you have
[48:18] the same life precious faith that Peter
[48:21] was talking about if not what do you
[48:24] have you know what do you have if you
[48:30] don't have it well I just don't see it
[48:32] I think I do it it's hard for me to
[48:36] stand here now I'm serious it's hard for
[48:38] me to stand here and look back at the
[48:40] dark ages and see those people dying
[48:42] like crazy but yet realizing that was
[48:46] the Holy Spirit in those people that was
[48:49] doing that right that was God in those
[48:55] people and they were dying to where we
[48:58] could come forth right but they were
[49:03] waiting on us that's brother Leticia's
[49:05] quit our Wednesday night I enjoy this
[49:07] message and you know but the point I
[49:09] wanted him to continue on was the fact
[49:12] that you you talk about you know
[49:15] EJ's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:18] DJ's got the pity you know they're great
[49:23] hood well why would anybody be upset
[49:27] about any other age getting more than
[49:29] that God now we got the new bird I'm
[49:31] serious this is this is my point I'm
[49:33] sorry
[49:35] well here we have all of us have the
[49:38] baptism and hole goes in these Church
[49:39] age
[49:40] well what if God give one Church edge a
[49:42] little more than the other because of
[49:44] the situation's of the way they existed
[49:47] or whatever are the harder times or the
[49:49] thing what would I be upset
[49:54] you mean I just get in you understand
[49:58] that sorry now I'm gonna preach this
[50:00] anyway yeah I just get in the body I get
[50:04] the new birth I get my penny I get my
[50:07] pay why don't I be upset with somebody
[50:11] getting more what would make me get
[50:17] upset because that brother Kali would
[50:20] get two pennies you know her
[50:23] whatever it was what would I say to that
[50:26] I thank God that he gave in there
[50:29] I mean I thank God down through the ages
[50:32] that we look at those things and you
[50:33] look at it the way the Prophet bring
[50:36] those ages coming down was marvelous to
[50:38] me to always mean so marvelous to think
[50:41] of how God could come on the scene and
[50:43] each one of those ages and do the things
[50:45] he done I'm just saying plain language
[50:53] if anybody is not happy with a penny
[50:57] they get then they didn't get a penny
[51:01] you did not get the baptism of the Holy
[51:04] Ghost if you're not satisfied with what
[51:06] you got well I think we ought to have
[51:10] more words what what would be the reason
[51:13] why would you not want everybody else to
[51:15] have more than you've got right why
[51:22] would you not want people to have more
[51:24] than what you like we're talking buddy
[51:26] you know in eternal life and in in do it
[51:29] why would not we be so happy that that
[51:31] gets me I've just charged my soul out to
[51:34] think about people that they get upset
[51:37] because well I don't want we know God's
[51:39] been better to them people are he he
[51:41] wouldn't over here he wouldn't know with
[51:42] our listen Church those spirits and
[51:50] things better get gone because they are
[51:53] not of God right why wouldn't we be
[51:58] happy for somebody else to make it for
[52:03] me to see that you made it and I miss it
[52:08] that's no problem I told you about it I
[52:12] had a dream just tell the dream is a
[52:14] dream I had a dream one time and I've
[52:15] seen all of you make it and I turned
[52:17] around and went back you know what I was
[52:21] happy I didn't go away crying and
[52:26] pouting and because that's just the way
[52:30] I am I want you to be there I want you
[52:35] to have everything you can have God
[52:38] pours it all on you and don't give me
[52:40] nothing but the
[52:41] I got the eternal life right that's
[52:46] that's just me I'm sorry all right but
[52:50] listen see those of like precious faith
[52:54] the same new birth in each age every age
[52:59] had the new birth that is the light
[53:02] precious faith then we start we brought
[53:05] it on up a little bit further in second
[53:07] theater to the divine nature that's what
[53:11] we're talking about an afternoon sir
[53:12] the divine nature of God the whole
[53:17] entire period is the divine nature of
[53:20] God
[53:23] it starts at faith that's the divine
[53:25] nature that gives us a very nature the
[53:28] very life of Almighty God His divine
[53:32] nature given into our hearts to make us
[53:36] his children when we don't deserve any
[53:39] of it but he gave these days and each
[53:44] time down through their part of his
[53:46] divine nature building the pyramid as it
[53:50] comes forth and goes on into all right
[53:53] the divine nature well I just don't see
[53:58] it well see that's you know a lot of
[54:02] people get up in the morning I guess and
[54:03] they say well I tell you what I don't
[54:08] see the Sun coming up with this you know
[54:13] you think it's gonna stop now I've
[54:17] always tried to explain this one time
[54:19] faith faith can bring light into being
[54:26] but unbelieving don't put light out I've
[54:31] always tried to explain that that's a
[54:33] carnal way of saying it but it's true
[54:34] darkness your unbelief is not gonna put
[54:37] out God you can pout in your novela
[54:41] mouth all you want that ain't gonna
[54:43] change God but your faith can increase
[54:50] as you see God living
[54:54] this is the day that we should be
[54:57] thinking about the greatest of all as
[55:00] you and I have year come to a place to
[55:03] work that we're facing stepping over
[55:08] into eternity well they said that all
[55:12] alone I've heard that and the first come
[55:14] into message well you still gonna hear
[55:18] today cause it's true
[55:20] somebody's gonna walk off this earth in
[55:22] a change of the body well you know while
[55:26] we're gonna do cause God said it that's
[55:30] the ninth time God said it was gonna be
[55:32] that way that's gonna be that away our
[55:34] on belief ain't gonna do it our own
[55:35] beliefs ain't you ain't gonna keep the
[55:37] Sun from coming up it's going to I've
[55:40] set out after all you want to sit I
[55:42] don't believe this coming up it's gonna
[55:44] come on up
[55:47] so this don't waste your time okay now
[55:50] back in that part trying to get it to us
[55:53] to a position to where we could
[55:56] understand I want to emphasize this over
[55:59] and over to us because of what I'm
[56:01] saying the doc turn was back there that
[56:05] we only have this some kind of a of work
[56:10] of God among us and and things that was
[56:13] called many different things but the the
[56:17] new birth is the new birth well we did
[56:21] you you know you claim that as the new
[56:22] burden people now the Prophet said it
[56:26] it's not what me and you say it's what
[56:29] the prophet said and the Prophet said
[56:31] what the what Peter said and Peter said
[56:34] what Paul said and Paul said what God
[56:37] said so now I feel pretty good way of
[56:40] lining it up you know so as long as we
[56:43] say what he's saying let's see what is
[56:46] it in the church a book where it says
[56:48] that the the fivefold ministry they
[56:52] don't they don't know how is it stated
[56:55] they don't in other words they don't
[56:57] honor the Word of God and believe God's
[56:59] Word to her even I mean I believe that I
[57:04] see that I see it among the
[57:07] the day in our that we're living so you
[57:09] know that as that's going on but just
[57:11] remember to one thing if we can see the
[57:14] devil working why can't we realize what
[57:17] God is doing why is the devil doing that
[57:24] they had to come up into the message and
[57:28] see the message in the point of their
[57:30] natural things before they could fall
[57:33] away you can't fall off of the house do
[57:35] you get upon it well see then that's the
[57:39] point of what I'm trying to get us to
[57:41] follow into that so now I want to make
[57:43] sure you follow that with a lineup like
[57:46] this those of like precious faith all
[57:52] right now go ahead and pull up number
[57:56] one so we read these other day in parts
[58:01] of them and all but I want to make sure
[58:03] he said having escaped the corruption of
[58:06] the world having escaped that the lust
[58:09] and the corruption of the world you're
[58:10] above that now who's just talking to
[58:15] those of like precious faith and the
[58:19] lust of the corruption of the world
[58:20] you're above that now now that's the
[58:22] type of person that he's talking to the
[58:25] person that has escaped these things see
[58:27] the corruption of the world you realize
[58:30] the new birth what it has done for you
[58:33] in that soul that you have within you is
[58:38] eternal life the very life of Almighty
[58:44] God living within us we can't die
[58:52] we've already died we died to ourselves
[58:55] and accepting Jesus Christ as our Savior
[59:00] why should we worry about things no
[59:05] there's no no problem that wrote it on
[59:07] that well this is what we'll get back to
[59:11] in a little bit now he has given us the
[59:16] outline here what
[59:19] to do he's giving us the outline of what
[59:24] to do
[59:24] Peters give it to us add to your faith
[59:27] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[59:29] caught in this really kind of charity
[59:33] know how to do it as I said we're all
[59:37] trying to come closer to God that's why
[59:40] I chose this message this morning the
[59:42] church knowing the people are traveling
[59:43] the different thing oh well what's he
[59:45] saying Peter is giving us an outline of
[59:50] how to come closer to God what you see
[59:58] we we we still put it well I just don't
[1:00:01] see it what does that mean God's not
[1:00:03] doing it is your tab of unbelief going
[1:00:09] to stop god I just don't I just don't
[1:00:14] see it I don't see the faith of heart
[1:00:18] I've tried to explain a lot of things to
[1:00:20] people and I know I get in trouble
[1:00:21] trying to explain but I do it to do it
[1:00:24] for the heping of you and I'll just keep
[1:00:26] on do anything you know I wonder what
[1:00:31] would happen if you took the book of
[1:00:33] Acts the people in the book of Acts and
[1:00:35] put us them in our day
[1:00:40] do you realize Jesus only faced the
[1:00:42] Sadducees Pharisees and the Herodians a
[1:00:45] couple of little groups right you
[1:00:49] realize that first church only faced two
[1:00:51] or three doctrinal issues and thoughts
[1:00:55] and you bring that down here to where we
[1:00:59] are right you don't never think about
[1:01:08] that said Lord how would it be with that
[1:01:10] church bringing it down Oh they've just
[1:01:12] me that they do do mm-hmm
[1:01:17] they'd be fighting like everything I
[1:01:21] like what one man said one time you know
[1:01:23] he's talking about Sid if he's talking
[1:01:25] about if Paul will hear he'd do this if
[1:01:27] Paul was here he'd do that if Paul was
[1:01:30] here and his brother was and said if
[1:01:31] Paul was here he'd how
[1:01:33] the best car he'd have a big Cadillac
[1:01:34] he'd have a big church he'd have a big
[1:01:37] this and big that you know I'm always
[1:01:42] sarcastic I know what I'm sorry but I
[1:01:45] said it like this when he finally hushed
[1:01:48] for a little bit I said if Paul was here
[1:01:50] he'd be in jail before midnight that's
[1:01:54] the best way to say he'd be in jail just
[1:01:57] a little bit huh
[1:01:59] but listen Church listen to what your
[1:02:04] prophet is saying do we believe in moon
[1:02:06] down to number two and start on the
[1:02:08] earth did my whole subject is based upon
[1:02:14] faith right you don't know he's saying
[1:02:18] that I have obtained this faith and I'm
[1:02:20] addressing this to them that have has
[1:02:23] obtaining the like precious faith I want
[1:02:26] it's not to the outside world it's to
[1:02:30] the church see those that are in Christ
[1:02:32] now how much clearer could it be how
[1:02:36] much plainer could it be what the
[1:02:38] Prophet is saying right okay yeah then
[1:02:45] think about it think about what he's
[1:02:49] saying the world we would escape that
[1:02:54] now he's addressing this to the church
[1:02:59] that's why we're here this morning is to
[1:03:02] find out what is the way what is God's
[1:03:05] requirements there's not a person in
[1:03:08] here that loves God but wants to wants
[1:03:11] to be come more like Christ
[1:03:14] now it's laid out here what every
[1:03:19] Christian laid out to me how to be more
[1:03:21] like Christ the statue of a perfect man
[1:03:24] is laying out how to be cooked more like
[1:03:27] Christ right it's bringing us to that
[1:03:34] position he says Peter is outlining
[1:03:41] something there for us that how to get
[1:03:46] there
[1:03:48] Peter's laying out how to get to the
[1:03:51] Statue of perfect man he's not laying
[1:03:57] out how to get born again he's
[1:04:00] addressing it to people that are born
[1:04:01] again this is addressed to the church
[1:04:06] those that are in Christ Jesus and on
[1:04:08] the way you'll be in Christ Jesus is
[1:04:09] what baptized by the baptism with the
[1:04:13] Holy Ghost into the body of Christ

[1:05:10] were telling how to become into the

[1:05:23] the Bible telling us add to your faith
[1:05:25] virtue or not attempt replacing them

[1:05:30] signs I brother Branham is saying the
[1:05:32] same thing

[1:06:57] made this for 40 years and listen to the
[1:07:00] point you get fed up with me saying
[1:07:01] thing forty years is what I've been
[1:07:03] saying
[1:07:03] do you realize without God sending a
[1:07:10] prophet were you and I would be you
[1:07:20] don't never think like that God what
[1:07:22] would it be in if you hadn't sent a
[1:07:24] prophet you realize there was nobody in
[1:07:30] organized religion teaching and never
[1:07:32] still and not doing it now teaching the
[1:07:34] statue of a perfect man I don't like to
[1:07:40] make things hard but I make them pretty
[1:07:42] hard do you realize there's an
[1:07:46] organization out there that 2nd Peter is
[1:07:54] laid out on the floor in that
[1:07:58] organization and is teaching you to how
[1:08:02] to come up the stature of a perfect man
[1:08:07] you got a ride out over here so
[1:08:11] it's called a staircase lecture you mean
[1:08:15] they know more about God than their true
[1:08:20] church well they're using it to show the
[1:08:27] stacks or the growth development then
[1:08:30] you got to go through degrees so now
[1:08:32] you'll know who what we're talking about
[1:08:33] okay without this being outlandish if
[1:08:37] you don't know who that was it's amazing
[1:08:38] Masonic Lodge Masonic Lodge we'll lay it
[1:08:40] out on there I've never been there but
[1:08:42] I've been told it and not just by one
[1:08:44] but by meaning you know what takes place
[1:08:47] in those places code I've always been
[1:08:48] honored by you know I never had no
[1:08:52] trouble with nobody called I'm going
[1:08:53] through awful nothing I never told the
[1:08:57] brothers here to get out of it but now
[1:09:03] listen and that's why I'm here this
[1:09:08] morning is try to teach this little
[1:09:10] church and myself how that we can become
[1:09:14] the dwelling place of the Living God
[1:09:18] okay then what go ahead to number six I
[1:09:24] want to get these to where you'll know
[1:09:26] that what I'm saying at least I'm trying
[1:09:28] to say what the prophets say it then you
[1:09:32] can make up your choice about what you
[1:09:34] believe huh look what he talked about
[1:09:38] we're not building an organization when
[1:09:40] I here this morning to build an
[1:09:41] organization Christ never sent me to
[1:09:43] build organization Christ sent me to
[1:09:45] build individuals to the stature of
[1:09:47] Jesus Christ that they might be the
[1:09:50] powerhouse and the dwelling place of the
[1:09:52] Spirit by His Word
[1:09:56] God sent that you see you know you don't
[1:10:04] listen to me when I'm trying to explain
[1:10:06] something now Peter was one really
[1:10:11] original right
[1:10:15] and he is teaching what Jesus taught him
[1:10:19] three and a half years right three and
[1:10:24] I've years I'll keep emphasizing that or
[1:10:26] you'll think about it they were in their
[1:10:28] teaching ministry to get them ready for
[1:10:31] the baptism of the holy ghost three and
[1:10:34] 1/2 years
[1:10:37] here comes the Apostle Paul Paul has
[1:10:43] nobody to teach him that's what he said
[1:10:45] said no man taught me this time why
[1:10:52] because he was a prophet I've tried to
[1:10:55] get you to see what a prophet means a
[1:10:58] prophet means a way or an opportunity to
[1:11:03] be able to get into the presence of God
[1:11:06] right hey I lost my muse you remember in
[1:11:11] the Bible well go here and do that hey I
[1:11:14] love so much stole my car right a
[1:11:19] prophet means an ability or an
[1:11:21] opportunity to enter into the presence
[1:11:24] of God you never thought about that of a
[1:11:27] prophet
[1:11:28] well here's Paul who taught Paul he went
[1:11:32] to the backside of the desert spent he
[1:11:34] said 15 one time another time he says
[1:11:36] three years or three and a higher
[1:11:38] studying the Word of God come out
[1:11:40] preaching the same thing Peter did who
[1:11:44] talked brother branham letter Brendan
[1:11:49] went to the backside of the desert just
[1:11:50] like Paul did and when we wrote around
[1:11:53] him come out from there he was teaching
[1:11:55] identically what Paul was teaching and
[1:11:57] teaching identically what Peter was
[1:11:59] teaching right see God took him to by
[1:12:04] himself and told him and gaining the
[1:12:09] uppity one because it was a promise to
[1:12:11] you and me Malachi 4 is a promise behold
[1:12:17] I send you Elijah the prophet it was a
[1:12:21] promise for him to send that that's the
[1:12:25] Word of God to be fulfilled
[1:12:30] right so then that's what he's doing
[1:12:36] that's what I'm trying to tell you
[1:12:38] Pross sent me to build individuals okay
[1:12:41] going to the next I've tried to get this
[1:12:47] message all of these is from the statue
[1:12:49] of perfect man in case you don't look
[1:12:51] down the river like I've tried to get
[1:12:53] this message over at the Tabernacle to
[1:12:55] see that these men each member of the
[1:12:58] tabernacle becomes this it's hard to do
[1:13:01] I've tried to have patience
[1:13:03] this is 33 years 33 years the man has
[1:13:09] tried to get the Branham tabernacle
[1:13:14] seeing the Word of God right now bring
[1:13:20] it on down to us by way of tapes and
[1:13:22] ministries inside right by way of the
[1:13:25] Prophet 33 years now that's something I
[1:13:32] need what about a man standing our day
[1:13:34] in and day out and he said Here I am he
[1:13:36] said I pour my heart out he said I
[1:13:38] preached here he said I'll go out and I
[1:13:40] come back and he said I find a women
[1:13:42] worse than it was when I left how do you
[1:13:45] think he felt
[1:13:52] how do you think he felt brother Ida
[1:13:57] wouldn't just speaking on women he'd go
[1:14:05] out and see it and come back and find
[1:14:06] those people in Wuerffel shape him
[1:14:10] trying to do everything he couldn't get
[1:14:12] it to him okay well let's go one more
[1:14:15] then we'll switch horses in the middle
[1:14:18] of the stream we in just a minute now
[1:14:20] now look what he says from the stature
[1:14:22] of a perfect man lust for money lust for
[1:14:27] big things lust for popularity these
[1:14:30] things are dead to the believer we don't
[1:14:32] care a 10 or a cottage washing up here
[1:14:36] live or die sinker drowned this is a
[1:14:39] thing that I'm interested in in the
[1:14:41] kingdom of God whether I maintain my
[1:14:43] home whether I maintain my family where
[1:14:46] I maintain whatever it is let me
[1:14:48] maintain Christ our hopeful glory beyond
[1:14:52] me up Oh Lord
[1:14:53] I listen to it into this let Christ be
[1:15:02] my head that working through me on my
[1:15:07] foundation my faith is in him let virtue
[1:15:11] knowledge temperance patient called it
[1:15:13] brotherly kindness working me all the
[1:15:15] Lord is my prayer I don't care live or
[1:15:18] die sink or swim
[1:15:22] that's all he desired to do was to teach
[1:15:27] us the statue of a perfect man
[1:15:33] now how to come to that we've already
[1:15:36] preached it so there's no worry I was
[1:15:41] laying her there they're not thinking
[1:15:42] ever their home thinking about what God
[1:15:45] has done for us because I'm serious and
[1:15:48] you heard me say this and I'll say it
[1:15:50] again so just go ahead then brother mold
[1:15:52] finished in 1971 or two right in their
[1:15:56] preaching on stature of a perfect lamb I
[1:16:01] asked him a simple question I said okay
[1:16:04] now we know what we need how do we get
[1:16:06] it he was serious because I serious then
[1:16:11] he said I don't know I said I don't
[1:16:15] either a lot of difference in having a
[1:16:21] knowledge of something or even knowing
[1:16:23] that you need something are to be able
[1:16:25] to say you've got what you need a lot of
[1:16:28] difference in it he was serious to
[1:16:30] answer it it was about 82 when God
[1:16:35] revealed to me what it would take I
[1:16:40] still believe that more and more today
[1:16:42] and I'll get to it when I get there how
[1:16:46] do we get these virtues well I just need
[1:16:50] Virgil I just have it now your profit if
[1:16:52] you read the message you heard him say
[1:16:54] but that's not the way to get it well I
[1:16:59] got how faith that's how well I
[1:17:03] did study the magic I'll get it um but
[1:17:11] listen now where does he go now I've
[1:17:20] read all of this from there back to try
[1:17:24] to declare and understand two people
[1:17:26] that knew that would listen on the
[1:17:29] internet or whatever you hear it to
[1:17:31] understand that we believe God promised
[1:17:34] to send Elijah the Prophet and Elijah
[1:17:38] the Prophet would come and bring the
[1:17:40] word unto us and he would have to come
[1:17:43] into the earth as a human being and grow
[1:17:46] in grace and knowledge of his own and
[1:17:48] keep bringing it more and more and more
[1:17:50] it's like I was showing the other day
[1:17:52] that brother Branham said I didn't know
[1:17:56] this would fit in here on this second
[1:17:58] Peter in other word until I was up in
[1:18:00] the woods the other day with Charlie and
[1:18:02] them and God showed me this when he's
[1:18:06] been teaching it all along you go back
[1:18:09] to the earth to the fifties and steady
[1:18:12] the message he was always trying to
[1:18:15] teach the growth development in Jesus
[1:18:17] Christ
[1:18:17] that's what caught me so much to realize
[1:18:20] that here's a man that had these things
[1:18:24] but yet always looking for more of God
[1:18:28] not satisfied with just being here and
[1:18:31] being there no but he comes out
[1:18:36] declaring build me up Lord fill me in
[1:18:43] other words with these things that I may
[1:18:45] teach others now here's what we're going
[1:18:49] to have a little chitter chatter for a
[1:18:52] minute okay but am I going I'm gonna
[1:18:56] read it and then you can decide what you
[1:18:58] want to okay
[1:19:01] look what he says let that work in me
[1:19:05] let Christ virtues and on his flow out
[1:19:07] that I might be able to teach those now
[1:19:14] he declares who's he's gonna teach but
[1:19:17] do we believe it come on for God has
[1:19:25] said in the church apostles prophets
[1:19:27] teachers pastors and evangelists all for
[1:19:31] the perfecting and bring in all these
[1:19:34] virtues into it for the perfecting
[1:19:42] perfection of the coming of the Son of
[1:19:45] God
[1:19:47] now he's declared what is to take place
[1:19:50] Lord fill me up build me up that I may
[1:19:53] teach others now he's taking the next
[1:19:55] stage of what that I may teach others
[1:20:02] that I may teach the fivefold ministry
[1:20:04] that they may bring these things now
[1:20:10] there's worth it if the brother that I
[1:20:12] heard to say it when he said brother
[1:20:13] Branham was the fivefold ministry no I
[1:20:17] told you what I believe he could fulfill
[1:20:19] every office of the fivefold ministry
[1:20:20] yes siree he could take each office and
[1:20:25] deliver and use that office and work in
[1:20:27] it because he was a prophet sent from
[1:20:29] God
[1:20:31] what he said now these young men will
[1:20:35] take it home and sweep it on to the
[1:20:38] coming of the Lord
[1:20:41] the fie foam industry the hey church I'm
[1:20:45] serious it's can be we need to get
[1:20:48] something straight get it straight and
[1:20:50] then just let down here so well this is
[1:20:52] it this is the straight thing right
[1:20:58] placing it in total order that the
[1:21:04] Prophet was to come to teach others how
[1:21:09] to get working what I am then he sees
[1:21:14] and he brings forth the fivefold
[1:21:15] ministry is that not according to
[1:21:17] Ephesians is it not according to
[1:21:21] Ephesians go ahead brother pull up the
[1:21:27] seasons you got down is that not
[1:21:29] according to what it says yes he that
[1:21:33] descended is the same awful that I've
[1:21:35] seen it up above all heavens that he
[1:21:37] might fill all things he gave some
[1:21:39] apostles some prophets and he talking
[1:21:41] about gifts right coming down some
[1:21:44] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[1:21:46] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:21:49] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:21:51] the body of Christ okay now I'm gonna
[1:21:57] lay it a little deeper in a second so
[1:21:59] you better start frowning or smiling one
[1:22:01] of the two okay
[1:22:02] you're real feisty on that let's just
[1:22:04] lay it out now if you don't believe in
[1:22:06] the fivefold ministry what you're doing
[1:22:07] here what are you using the fivefold
[1:22:14] ministry is just a hope just in case
[1:22:16] this fails over here let me be over here
[1:22:19] that won't work
[1:22:20] what do you believe in the fivefold
[1:22:22] ministry but I told you over and over
[1:22:26] told you want to go
[1:22:27] I don't believe with all the fivefold
[1:22:29] ministry that's Nexus to me at the
[1:22:31] fivefold ministry I have no problems
[1:22:35] with that I'm not talking about those
[1:22:38] with false doctrines and thunders and
[1:22:41] virtues and souls and all kind of
[1:22:44] River Jordans and no holy ghost and all
[1:22:46] of that coming down
[1:22:47] I spent how many services back about
[1:22:50] three years ago that I covered each one
[1:22:52] of those doctrines and why I do not
[1:22:55] believe them took a whole service like I
[1:22:59] don't believe in the two Lords I don't
[1:23:01] believe in the two sold I don't believe
[1:23:03] in the seventh under virtual messages I
[1:23:05] don't I believe what brother Branham
[1:23:07] said well I've been honest enough well I
[1:23:11] thought man they're gonna get me on this
[1:23:13] one
[1:23:13] one man sent back a note and said you
[1:23:17] don't understand brother so-and-so that
[1:23:20] was the only comment that I had after I
[1:23:24] forgot how many services covering each
[1:23:27] doctrinal issue and showing why I don't
[1:23:31] believe it because I won't be the pastor
[1:23:34] I'm gonna make it plain right I believe
[1:23:39] in a fivefold ministry right but I don't
[1:23:44] believe in a onefold
[1:23:46] and I don't mean brother Branham will
[1:23:49] put that above okay brother Branham was
[1:23:51] outside the fivefold ministry in the
[1:23:52] base he could fulfil it was in the
[1:23:54] office but he comes outside the fivefold
[1:23:56] ministry to teach those that are in the
[1:23:57] fivefold ministry that's all I've ever
[1:23:59] said to you not putting him outside know
[1:24:03] where we're putting it to the right
[1:24:06] order he's the one that brought the
[1:24:09] message we're supposed to take his
[1:24:12] message and declare it to the people and
[1:24:15] teach it the same way he did and look
[1:24:20] for the same things he looked for right
[1:24:25] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:24:27] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:24:29] the body of Christ till we all come in
[1:24:31] the unity of the faith and the knowledge
[1:24:33] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[1:24:36] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:24:38] fullness of Christ that we henceforth be
[1:24:41] no more children tossed to and fro and
[1:24:43] curd about with every wind of doctrine
[1:24:45] by the sleight of men and cunning
[1:24:47] craftiness whereby they lie in wait to
[1:24:49] deceive but speaking the truth in love
[1:24:51] may grow up into him in all things which
[1:24:54] is the head even Christ
[1:24:57] I believe in the FIFO ministry and then
[1:25:07] there's no part so saying well well
[1:25:10] brother so-and-so don't believe it
[1:25:11] without ain't gonna do it Sam yeah I'm
[1:25:13] not so and so that's it's been if you
[1:25:14] don't talk to God itself I think the one
[1:25:18] but I just ask you a simple question
[1:25:20] what are you doing listening if you
[1:25:22] don't believe in the five for ministry
[1:25:23] and the heaven help don't make it well
[1:25:26] just in case these other things that
[1:25:29] I've got don't work out let me have this
[1:25:33] right here this would be straight and
[1:25:36] honest and say this is where we're
[1:25:38] staying
[1:25:40] all right and see then that puts it into
[1:25:44] that place place to her that we can lay
[1:25:48] it down and just say this is it you say
[1:25:53] to me brother day what do you believe I
[1:25:54] believe the Word of God and I believe
[1:26:00] God has declared it and brought it unto
[1:26:02] us
[1:26:02] he wrote it delivered it brought it into
[1:26:06] our being gave us the wonderful
[1:26:08] opportunity of books and etc you know
[1:26:11] the printings and the thing to where we
[1:26:13] could read it he got it brought over in
[1:26:15] two different languages you know King
[1:26:17] James Version zet cetera to word that we
[1:26:20] could be able to read it and study it he
[1:26:23] has given us everything that was to be
[1:26:27] and he promised to send a prophet in the
[1:26:30] last day and he said it right
[1:26:35] he said the prophet of God among us to
[1:26:38] bring the message the Prophet had to go
[1:26:41] back and put his in the Bible he said
[1:26:43] there's we're not adding to they said to
[1:26:47] and said when your ability said you
[1:26:49] could write or what 23rd chapter of
[1:26:50] Revelation he said they were trying to
[1:26:52] trap him but then he turned it back to
[1:26:55] the honest to the point he said you
[1:26:57] can't add to the Word of God that if you
[1:27:01] do you add two plagues to your own self
[1:27:07] look what it's so dangerous to say
[1:27:09] well brother branham was a false prophet
[1:27:13] you know well what are you saying when
[1:27:16] you say and he's not right with God what
[1:27:21] you see Church to believe what the
[1:27:24] prophet has brought us is wonderful but
[1:27:31] that takes a FIFO ministry to carry it
[1:27:34] home there's any problem with that
[1:27:37] I mean that's the Word of God and that's
[1:27:41] the prophet yeah but I just don't sit
[1:27:44] what that's where the trouble is I have
[1:27:49] seen we want our own ways and that's
[1:27:55] where we hear what we want to Richard
[1:27:57] now talking about this yesterday coming
[1:27:58] up the road you know really you hear
[1:28:00] what you want to hear they don't matter
[1:28:03] what's there do you hear what you want
[1:28:04] to hear right now that may be sound
[1:28:06] crazy but it's true they don't matter
[1:28:09] what say it you get what you believe
[1:28:12] like I said about the brother that said
[1:28:13] he believed in the fivefold ministry
[1:28:15] most people do what Arthur brother he
[1:28:17] blame the fivefold ministry yeah he
[1:28:19] believes it his one out and he believes
[1:28:21] in it did you say he don't believe in it
[1:28:23] said now he believes in it within the
[1:28:25] next get another message it says brother
[1:28:29] Branham was the fivefold ministry well
[1:28:34] somebody needs get straight that's all I
[1:28:41] say it not trying to make anything to
[1:28:45] word it would do but try my best to
[1:28:48] explain to you what the Bible is talking
[1:28:52] about why don't we get down to what the
[1:28:56] word is saying it's like I said want to
[1:28:58] go you mean I would backslide go back
[1:29:00] out in the world first thing you know

[1:30:27] right you can't lose it if you ever had
[1:30:31] it and you came back slide if you ain't
[1:30:36] been some work to backslide from take it

[1:30:45] well praise God knowing there's somebody
[1:30:47] right we can get with God to get
[1:30:53] straight well you're not gonna condemn
[1:30:57] us all sinners to hell why why when
[1:31:05] we're all brethren said we backside Daly
[1:31:07] is that what he said oh but that was he
[1:31:14] meant to say you backside he knowed how
[1:31:18] to talk
[1:31:21] he said we that's what always were so
[1:31:27] marvelous with me to read him and hear
[1:31:29] him say those things that he put herself
[1:31:32] right in this category
[1:31:34] with everybody he never boosted his self
[1:31:37] away up above
[1:31:38] even though ever ride in the world was
[1:31:41] to be there because of what God done
[1:31:45] every rider in the world was to boost
[1:31:47] him up but he never boosted itself up he
[1:31:52] always boosted the people up that's a
[1:31:57] true Christian he had that grace that
[1:32:00] her brother was talking about Wednesday
[1:32:01] night see if you know how Grace you
[1:32:03] can't give out grace right you can't
[1:32:07] give out grace if you don't have grace
[1:32:11] you don't know what grace is how can you
[1:32:13] give grace to anybody else but come on
[1:32:19] church I'm trying to get you to just to
[1:32:22] see the truth of what we're talking
[1:32:23] about God wrote in his word with the
[1:32:27] Apostle Peter Paul would come along
[1:32:29] riding his writings and they're all
[1:32:31] saying the same thing different wording
[1:32:35] different mannerisms different styles
[1:32:37] different things to say different things
[1:32:40] to deal with
[1:32:40] yes but the same faith
[1:32:44] now you remember life Sunday when I
[1:32:46] thought I went over and over over and
[1:32:47] over one faith one Lord one baptism not
[1:32:53] many face no not a faith it's be faith
[1:33:01] right see then let's put our whole life
[1:33:05] on the one thing and see for ourselves
[1:33:07] what it's all about God has given us the
[1:33:11] opportunity to have a great day in a
[1:33:15] time to live you realize that sometimes
[1:33:18] it would be better if we were totally
[1:33:20] persecuted now I can quote brother
[1:33:23] Branham so come on the run said the
[1:33:25] church does better under persecution now
[1:33:28] you know yourself you do better when
[1:33:30] things are going wrong somebody to get a
[1:33:32] that's our problem that's my problem
[1:33:33] right now ain't nobody want to argue
[1:33:35] with okay are you gonna argue it but I'm
[1:33:44] sure gonna contend for the faith
[1:33:47] right why can't we be what we are and
[1:33:53] just be Christians in this and the last
[1:33:58] side all of the things of doctrines of
[1:34:00] man's ideas and come forth with the Word
[1:34:03] of God
[1:34:05] come on musicians come on I'm just
[1:34:09] trying my best to get you to see
[1:34:11] something
[1:34:11] and if it hurts your feelings I'm sorry
[1:34:15] but I'm not sorry we're bringing out in
[1:34:19] the open any thoughts this is contrary
[1:34:21] to the Word of God I'm not because
[1:34:26] that's that's what I'm here for
[1:34:28] that's the things that we're - and
[1:34:30] that's what I've said to you now I made
[1:34:32] it plain two or three times one more
[1:34:35] Paul and Peter said the same thing the
[1:34:40] Prophet said in the same time the
[1:34:47] fivefold ministry is to say the same
[1:34:49] thing if you don't change the fivefold
[1:34:51] ministry is that plain enough is that
[1:34:57] and and brother Branham even made it's
[1:34:59] older than frantically one time he says
[1:35:00] it asked him honestly what was the
[1:35:02] question will the bride have a will rot
[1:35:06] have a ministry they know who knows what
[1:35:09] he said I know one back her shaking head
[1:35:12] two or three you know what said will the
[1:35:15] bride have a ministry sure she consists
[1:35:20] of apostles prophets evangelists pastors
[1:35:23] and teachers they were asking him about
[1:35:29] a ministry and he's explaining the
[1:35:31] ministry come on that's the quote will
[1:35:34] the bride have a ministry he did say yes
[1:35:36] it's gonna be great things hear great
[1:35:38] things out darkness to be Doudna he said
[1:35:40] she the bride consists of apostles
[1:35:44] prophets evangelists pastors and
[1:35:46] teachers that's the ministry
[1:35:54] that's why I've always said wouldn't it
[1:35:56] be something for coming to ask you to
[1:35:57] run for president and I'm a pastor of a
[1:36:01] church and asked me to run for president
[1:36:05] will that be the biggest disgrace well
