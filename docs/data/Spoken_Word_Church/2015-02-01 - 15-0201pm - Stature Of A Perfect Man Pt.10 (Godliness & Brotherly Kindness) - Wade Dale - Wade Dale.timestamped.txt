[13:58] them that have obtained like Precious
[14:00] Faith with us through the righteousness
[14:02] of God and our Savior Jesus
[14:05] Christ you can make yourself part of
[14:07] that or you cannot make yourself part of
[14:09] that all right to them that have
[14:10] obtained like Precious Faith all right
[14:13] that didn't mean that Peter got a faith

[14:34] godliness through the knowledge of him
[14:36] that has called us to glory and virtue
[14:38] whereby are given I like that that's why
[14:41] I ital made that word a different color
[14:44] given they're given to us exceeding
[14:45] great and precious promises that by
[14:47] these you might be partakers of the
[14:49] divine nature having escaped the
[14:51] corruption that is in the world through
[14:53] lust that's what we're talking about
[14:54] this morning turning going away then God
[14:57] will take that away and bes besides this
[14:59] giving all diligence add to your faith
[15:01] virtue and to Virtue knowledge to
[15:02] knowledge Temperance Temperance patience
[15:05] to patience godliness to godlin
[15:06] brotherly kindness into brotherly
[15:08] kindness charity for if these things be
[15:11] in you and abound they make you that you
[15:14] shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[15:16] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[15:17] Christ that new birth turns you in a
[15:20] Direction but these virtues make you if
[15:22] you if you develop if they develop in
[15:25] you
[15:26] as as true Holy Ghost virtu isues
[15:29] they're going to turn hey how do you
[15:30] think we're going to get this thing
[15:31] under control there's no way to get this
[15:33] under control under present conditions
[15:36] under just faith alone faith alone won't
[15:39] do it faith alone will save you give you
[15:41] the new birth and put you in the kingdom
[15:43] of God right but does it make you a full
[15:47] um Christian that God can use no not to
[15:50] the degree he wants to use you all right
[15:53] but you have the opportunity as we read
[15:56] the quote brother Brown says it's just
[15:57] how high your faith is for if things be
[15:59] in you and abound they make you in other
[16:01] words they turn your whole attitude that
[16:03] you should neither be Barren nor
[16:05] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[16:06] Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these
[16:08] things is blind and cannot see a far off
[16:12] there's a lot of people has a problem
[16:13] with Revelation like we're talking about
[16:14] this morning they have a problem with
[16:15] the Revelation well they're born again
[16:17] but they can't see a far off right and
[16:19] have forgotten that he was purged from
[16:21] his old sins wherefore the rather
[16:23] Brethren give diligence to make your
[16:26] calling and election sure for if you do
[16:28] these things you shall never fall Lord
[16:31] add his Blessing to the reading of his
[16:33] word you can be seated you shall never
[16:36] fall I
[16:38] um at at the end of service last Sunday
[16:41] you know we sang that song It Is Well
[16:43] with My Soul I just want to make a
[16:44] comment on that have you ever looked up
[16:46] the story behind that because it it's
[16:48] really a striking uh story that we sang
[16:52] there and it kind of lifted everybody up
[16:54] a little bit and um being lifting up I
[16:58] uh s sister um milka said have you ever
[17:00] read the story about the man that
[17:02] actually pinned it Is Well with My Soul
[17:05] well his name is Horatio
[17:07] spafford all right these hymns were
[17:09] written I got this off of off of
[17:11] Wikipedia the hymn was written after a
[17:12] traumatic event in spafford's life
[17:14] because if you listen to this for a
[17:15] minute you'll never forget the lyrics of
[17:18] this song and what this man was going
[17:20] through when he wrote this verse These
[17:22] verses the first was the 1871 Great
[17:25] Chicago Fire which ruined him
[17:26] financially he was a success uccessful
[17:28] lawyer he had owned real estate and the
[17:31] 1871 Chicago Fire um wiped him out all
[17:36] right his business interests were
[17:37] further hit by the economic downturn in
[17:40] 1873 at which time he had planned to
[17:42] travel to Europe with his family on the
[17:44] SS V de hav in a late change of plans he
[17:48] sent the family ahead while he was
[17:50] delayed on business concern business
[17:52] concerning zoning problems following the
[17:54] Great Chicago Fire while crossing the
[17:57] Atlantic the ship sank
[18:00] rapidly after colliding with another sea
[18:02] vessel and all four of spafford's
[18:05] daughters
[18:06] died lost four
[18:09] daughters think about that he lost $
[18:12] four do four daughters and his wife was
[18:15] the only Survivor she continued on to
[18:18] England well he was coming but the the
[18:20] story behind all this and I want you to
[18:22] see is this man was a was a devout
[18:26] Christian he was a student of Dwight
[18:29] Moody and irisi he was actually going to
[18:31] Europe to see Dwight Moody so he was a
[18:34] devout Christian man and watched what
[18:36] happened here though his daughters died
[18:38] his wife Anna survived and sent him the
[18:40] now famous telegram saved
[18:46] alone shortly afterwards as spafford
[18:49] traveled to meet his grieving wife now
[18:51] think about that that's it wasn't like
[18:52] they got on a plane and went over there
[18:54] it took him a month to get there to get
[18:56] from Chicago to the port in New York and
[18:59] then on a vessel over to to England so
[19:01] she had to wait on him but afterwards
[19:04] shortly afterwards as spafford travel to
[19:06] meet his grieving wife he was inspired
[19:09] to write these words as his ship passed
[19:11] near where his daughters died that's
[19:15] right and he wrote this
[19:19] verse when peace like a
[19:21] river attended my way when Sorrows like
[19:25] Seas Billows
[19:27] roll whatever my
[19:31] lot thou Hast taught me to know it is
[19:35] well it Is Well with My Soul a man that
[19:39] lost four
[19:41] daughters lost all of his
[19:44] earnings look like the guy should have
[19:46] just give up he pins one of the greatest
[19:49] songs greatest Christian songs ever
[19:51] written so you'll never sing that song
[19:54] again without realizing that man the
[19:56] sorrow he was going through when he
[19:57] wrote that that
[19:59] song and then he continues on and he
[20:01] doesn't even go back to Chicago because
[20:03] you know what they
[20:04] said the people in Chicago said there
[20:07] must be something wrong with you because
[20:09] God has laid all these plagues on you so
[20:12] he went to Jerusalem and he died in
[20:14] Jerusalem on his 69th birthday and never
[20:18] went back to the United States because
[20:20] they told him that he had must he was a
[20:22] secret Center and he must have done
[20:23] something wrong it's why God was laying
[20:25] all these plagues on him no I believe
[20:28] it was for that
[20:30] song it was for that song that now has
[20:32] meaning when Sorrows like be sees bows
[20:35] Ro whatever my light thou H has taught
[20:37] me to Know It Is Well with My Soul amen
[20:41] the Lord does some things for us right
[20:44] and we don't understand them but you'll
[20:47] understand them in by and by he probably
[20:51] died thought thinking he was a
[20:53] failure because a man named Paul Bliss
[20:55] is the one that actually put the uh
[20:57] music to the to the song and then it's
[21:00] been sang All Over The World by
[21:02] different people so I I I enjoy the song
[21:04] but I enjoy it more now that knowing
[21:07] that a man was was in such sorrow and
[21:10] tragedy till he could pin one of the
[21:12] greatest songs in the world so all right
[21:15] let's get started this morning of course
[21:17] we backed up a little bit but that's
[21:20] okay but we started with justification
[21:22] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:24] is a new birth all right we remember
[21:27] that we were looking in Ephesians
[21:30] 4:
[21:32] 11 we're going to read
[21:34] it next one
[21:43] down Bob just jumped right over
[21:48] Zach you didn't hear him hit the wall
[21:50] back
[21:51] then no just
[21:54] kidding cuz we're going to roll through
[21:56] this pretty quick and I had a few points
[21:58] I wanted to make he gave some I want you
[22:00] to see this though this is this is how
[22:02] we're going to get it so there's no
[22:03] other way I don't you know just beat it
[22:05] in your brain this is how you're going
[22:07] to get it and he gave some Apostles some
[22:09] prophets some evangelists some pastors
[22:11] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[22:14] saints three things for the work of the
[22:16] ministry wish we had time to minister on
[22:18] all three of those because it's
[22:19] perfecting of the Saints work of the
[22:20] ministry and edifying of the body all
[22:23] right till we all come and it's look it
[22:26] didn't separate this group this group's
[22:28] in this right okay for the edifying of
[22:31] the body so that just dumps everybody
[22:33] into that one into that one uh office as
[22:37] we're all Christians till we all come to
[22:39] the unity of faith and of the knowledge
[22:40] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[22:42] unto the measure of the stature of the
[22:45] fullness of Christ amen now let's go to
[22:47] the quote that I want to read quote
[22:49] number one that we've been reading
[22:51] before but I want you to really get this
[22:53] because it is it's it's it's your you
[22:55] must be born again and when you're born
[22:57] again you can't be bornn again without
[22:59] having faith that's right so you see on
[23:01] my chart here I got the very Foundation
[23:03] faith is the foundation of all of it
[23:06] down scroll it down to the to the top
[23:08] there brother Z you're possessed of one
[23:11] that dominates your life just depends on
[23:13] how much Faith you have is how high you
[23:15] can rise all right and I want you you
[23:18] say well keep reading it over again I
[23:19] want you to
[23:22] realize that it's up to you that's right
[23:25] and if you're born again you already
[23:26] have the faith
[23:28] right you just got to exercise it you
[23:31] got to get it out there got to be a way
[23:33] like like with virtue when we were
[23:35] reading that we're not going to read the
[23:36] quote remember brother BR said I got to
[23:37] have an outlet there's got to be an
[23:39] outlet to get that virtue out cuz it's
[23:42] an outward expression of an inward work
[23:44] right same way with you know like water
[23:46] baptism water baptism doesn't save you
[23:48] but it's an outward expression of an
[23:52] inward work now what is the inward work
[23:55] right Peter said repent that's the
[23:58] inward work Peter said repent you can
[24:02] bury them you can baptize them 100 th000
[24:06] times unless they've repented that does
[24:08] them no good that's right just makes
[24:10] them actually two more F twofold more
[24:12] child of hell if you don't teach them
[24:14] right right cuz they'll think their
[24:16] baptism is what save them and it's not
[24:18] it's an outward expression these virtues
[24:20] are all an outward expression of an
[24:23] inward work that God is in there doing
[24:25] the work not you all right
[24:28] all right but look but remember faith
[24:30] alone won't do it you got to have faith
[24:32] but it's how high you can rise after you
[24:34] get that Faith all right you get that
[24:37] faith and then you got to rise up higher
[24:40] than just faith alone because faith
[24:42] alone won't do it all right and you got
[24:45] to have a substance Faith the faith that
[24:48] we
[24:49] have the faith that we have at the new
[24:51] birth is a substance Faith right brother
[24:54] Dale preached on that you're not too
[24:55] long ago on substance Faith but but the
[24:58] substance of that faith I believe is
[25:00] these virtues because you can't have
[25:02] it's like Brother D always said I'm born
[25:04] again I'm born again but when I get my
[25:07] body
[25:08] changed that's when I amen that's when
[25:11] I'll be born again because you still got
[25:15] this guy that you know came from those
[25:18] two people right
[25:19] there amen but when we're changed in the
[25:22] moment in twinking of an ey we'll have
[25:24] one like he has will be him made
[25:27] manifest we are that inside right but as
[25:32] we are down here on Earth that's what we
[25:34] have got to have to get this body
[25:37] changed
[25:39] right one more time if we don't have
[25:41] this brothers and sisters anybody on the
[25:44] internet whereever if we don't have
[25:45] these virtues in our life there's no way
[25:48] we can take a body change because
[25:50] there's always going to be a hindrance
[25:51] this is going to be a hindrance what
[25:53] those virtues are doing is they're
[25:55] they're moving that hindrance out of the
[25:56] way amen like said giving you a giving
[25:59] you a virtue Faith which is a strong
[26:01] faith not just Faith gives you a strong
[26:02] faith give you some Faith with power all
[26:05] right we acts
[26:07] 18 going up to acts 1 18 and we'll or go
[26:10] to
[26:11] Virtue because virtue faith is what we
[26:13] have to have next I think he had it
[26:15] already up there a minute ago which is
[26:16] that's that's okay there you go got to
[26:18] have that virtue of Faith which is what
[26:20] strength our strong faith and then in
[26:23] Acts 1 and8 Jesus tells us he says hey
[26:26] I'm going to give you power after right
[26:30] I'm going to give you power after that
[26:32] the Holy Ghost has come on you the Holy
[26:34] Ghost comes then you get the power all
[26:37] right as sister Anna kamani was was said
[26:40] she had always wondered about how they
[26:42] you know how they stacked up there well
[26:44] that's the only way they can or God
[26:46] would have put them a different way
[26:48] right you got to have faith then you got
[26:50] have a strong faith then to add to that
[26:52] strong faith you got to have some
[26:53] knowledge and before you can have
[26:55] Temperance you definitely got to have
[26:57] knowledge right all right or knowledge
[27:00] Faith but you shall receive power or
[27:03] virtue after that the Holy Ghost has
[27:05] come upon you and you shall be witnesses
[27:07] to me in both Jerusalem and all Judea
[27:09] Samaria and the uttermost parts of the
[27:11] earth so that's talking about us we must
[27:13] have power after that the Holy Ghost
[27:15] comes remember you don't have
[27:18] power before the Holy Ghost comes right
[27:21] you have no power at all all right the
[27:24] only thing you have I was going to bring
[27:26] it out this morning I'll bring it out
[27:27] now the only Power you have before you
[27:30] get born again is to bring yourself to a
[27:33] place where God can work on you right
[27:35] remember justification justification
[27:37] that CHS off your past sins you still
[27:39] got the same devil in you but you're
[27:41] putting him in a different environment
[27:43] right that he's really uncomfortable
[27:47] with and I like that cuz it makes him
[27:51] nervous cuz remember if you say I want
[27:53] to get born again or if you say I want
[27:56] to change my life or I want to you know
[27:58] I want to give my heart to the Lord now
[28:00] you can do that but 6 months later
[28:03] you're doing the same thing yeah you got
[28:06] to go back right all right you got to go
[28:09] back cuz something happened in there
[28:12] that or something didn't happen actually
[28:14] you got to come back and say hey I
[28:16] wasn't really sincere amen I wasn't
[28:20] really sincere if you have sincere
[28:23] justification that means that it's going
[28:25] to take you all the way to the New Birth
[28:27] amen those who is Justified he is
[28:29] already glorified all right so it's a
[28:32] journey but whose responsibility is it
[28:34] it's yours right if you're going to lean
[28:36] back over here and go back toward that
[28:37] group that you were with that means that
[28:40] your justification was not one that's
[28:42] going to carry you on to sanctification
[28:44] it's going to carry you on to the
[28:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost you just found
[28:48] Jesus in jail
[28:51] yeah I mean that's what really I mean
[28:53] you know and I believe God does chop off
[28:55] people's past sins you're right yes by
[28:57] said he's just to forgive you all you
[29:00] got to do is ask believe on the Lord
[29:02] Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved if
[29:04] you died right then you going to heaven
[29:05] but you're not going to be a part of
[29:06] this right right amen but now if you do
[29:11] that and then 6 months later you're
[29:12] still doing the same thing I'd be
[29:14] careful right you understand cuz it's a
[29:17] same thing with these virtues if this is
[29:19] not helping you you need to go back to
[29:21] the beginning now lay me down to sleep
[29:24] yeah most of you know what I'm talking
[29:26] about right right brother B said that
[29:28] that guy that was dying the priest said
[29:31] where you need to go back and find God
[29:33] where you left him and he started saying
[29:34] now lay me down to sleep what happened
[29:36] was he left him when he was a little
[29:37] child so you got to go back listen
[29:40] remember God will be right here right
[29:43] he'll be right here waiting on you if
[29:44] that's where you got to come back to
[29:46] he'll be right here waiting on you you
[29:47] just come right back to that spot and
[29:49] say God I'm sorry it wasn't really
[29:52] honest I really didn't want to be
[29:54] forgiven and that's really what you got
[29:55] to say yeah I want to be forgiven
[29:57] because they got caught right most of
[30:00] the time that's what that is but really
[30:02] for Godly sorrow leadeth to repentance
[30:05] then if you if you're really sorrow for
[30:07] what sorrowful for what you do he will
[30:09] forgive that then you got to walk and
[30:11] continue on same thing with these
[30:13] vertues he said well I got the new birth
[30:16] okay you're a baby we don't want you to
[30:18] stay babies we want you to have some
[30:20] some strength where like
[30:24] Peter walking in the gate beautiful he
[30:27] didn't have to have a church crowd
[30:30] around him he didn't have to have the
[30:32] atmosphere of of you know 14 or 15
[30:34] deacons or or you know Elders of the
[30:37] church around him and building him up no
[30:38] it just him and another guy was with it
[30:40] they were just walking down the road
[30:41] right right he didn't have to go get it
[30:44] it was already there all right and what
[30:47] did he do is he just displayed that to
[30:49] that man at the gate beautiful all right
[30:52] so that's what we as Christians because
[30:56] we don't want to stay babies we don't
[30:57] want to be we've got to start there
[31:00] right but let's don't end up there right
[31:04] cuz you born a baby and you you're an
[31:10] adult Jesus was a man right and he's
[31:13] expecting us to be a man amen the
[31:15] virtues were working in a man's life all
[31:18] right now we read acts one now we've
[31:21] come to knowledge faith and let's look
[31:23] at the U continue with the definition of
[31:25] knowledge faith
[31:28] brother Zach knowledge signifies in
[31:31] general in general intelligence
[31:34] understanding the general knowledge of
[31:35] Christian religion but now remember let
[31:38] me stop for a second I want to really
[31:40] emphasize this just because you read the
[31:43] Bible and you got you know 14 stars for
[31:45] reading the Bible 14 times that means
[31:48] nothing to God
[31:50] right right if the most illiterate
[31:53] person can receive the new birth brother
[31:55] Louise that guy can't read
[31:57] right so it must be that God he listens
[32:01] God brings something to him and it what
[32:04] it affects it comes in here and then the
[32:06] effect is down here right cuz he really
[32:09] can't read like brother J for he
[32:11] couldn't read he said God you got to
[32:12] teach me to read if you want me to read
[32:14] your Bible that's what you got to do you
[32:15] got to teach me to read and he did all
[32:17] right but look so it's not a it's it
[32:20] starts with a general knowledge of
[32:21] Christian religion sure that's why you
[32:23] got to study Show Yourself approved I'd
[32:27] rather study two scriptures and know
[32:29] what they are than to read a whole
[32:30] chapter and be reading it like a
[32:32] newspaper like a buck cuz we all know
[32:35] the stories of Noah and and Moses and
[32:38] that's just good stories all right we
[32:40] want a deeper more perfect and enlarg
[32:43] knowledge of this religion such as
[32:45] belongs to the more advanced that's why
[32:47] you got to be more advanced up the
[32:51] pyramid more advanced especially of
[32:54] things lawful and unlawful for
[32:55] Christians moral wisdom
[32:57] such as seen in right living so it
[33:00] continues on with right living all the
[33:02] way even up into knowledge now let's go
[33:06] to Temperance and Temperance faith is
[33:08] the one that we that I really think
[33:10] Temperance see us right there in the
[33:11] middle we're not far from the top and
[33:14] you got
[33:15] Temperance right there's the right
[33:17] there's the key right
[33:20] there a virtue of one who Masters his
[33:23] desire and passions especially his
[33:25] sensual appetites and that doesn't have
[33:27] to mean sexual that means anything
[33:29] sensual that's not according to God's
[33:31] word cuz you know he we use that word
[33:34] love all the time I love to hunt I love
[33:36] to fish
[33:38] well what are you talking about what's
[33:41] love right I'm sorry it's not a love
[33:45] that's right it's not a goppy love it's
[33:47] FAL love and actually that's not even
[33:48] filo love you're just using it as a word
[33:51] right right yeah that's the thank you we
[33:55] can stop right there mastering
[33:57] controlling curving restraining
[34:00] controlling oneself temperate and
[34:04] continent that's the person when you get
[34:06] up there to Temperance I'm telling you
[34:07] that Temperance and patience is right in
[34:09] there together but that is control that
[34:12] is a controlled faith that we must have
[34:16] you can't go any further cuz remember
[34:19] once you that's why I was telling them
[34:20] downstairs once you get to Temperance
[34:23] the next thing is your trial right yes
[34:27] patience remember the try remember
[34:30] patience Faith there's no way to get
[34:33] patience but by trials now if Temperance
[34:35] was up here sister anakani and patience
[34:37] was down
[34:39] here you might blow up right here if
[34:41] Temperance is above it but if you've got
[34:43] that self-control in
[34:46] place right the trials are going to come
[34:50] that's right right right the trying of
[34:52] your faith much more precious than gold
[34:55] it's going to give the you
[34:59] patience there's no way to patience but
[35:01] by trials cuz everything we read every
[35:03] everyone that we read this morning of
[35:06] patience faith is something to do with
[35:08] God trying you right easy to have
[35:12] patience if you're sitting in the
[35:14] doctor's office and 2 minutes after you
[35:16] sit down they take you
[35:19] in then you well I know that's
[35:24] impossible sorry
[35:27] but if you're there for two hours how
[35:30] you going to do how you going to feel 2
[35:32] minutes versus two hours the trying of
[35:35] your faith is what's going to do it so
[35:37] let's go to the definition of patience
[35:40] and then we'll get to Godliness and your
[35:43] patience possess your souls look
[35:45] steadfastness look how much
[35:48] more compacted the scripture says there
[35:51] that we that in Ephesians that we have
[35:52] everything's compacted everything's got
[35:54] to start being squeezed in here because
[35:56] look
[35:57] honestly you need a whole lot of faith
[36:00] as you get further up it's pushing in
[36:04] pushing in it's pressing it's pressing
[36:07] it's squeezing you what up right all
[36:10] right not out up right all right
[36:12] steadfastness constancy endurance in the
[36:16] New Testament the characteristics of a
[36:18] man who is not swerve from his
[36:19] deliberate purpose and his loyalty to
[36:22] Faith and piety by even the greatest
[36:25] trials and suffering
[36:27] patiently and
[36:29] steadfastly steadfast waiting for
[36:31] enduring sustaining and
[36:34] perseverance we've waited 50s something
[36:37] years to come to a place that brother
[36:40] brandom was at in 1965 right 63 actually
[36:45] God has waited on us and been patient
[36:48] right for us to come to a place that's
[36:49] why brother B I believe he said the
[36:51] first thing we got to do is have
[36:53] patience with God right then have
[36:55] patience with everybody else else all
[36:57] right let's go to James 1:24 and then
[36:59] we'll start on
[37:00] godliness here in just a second my
[37:02] brethren count it all joy when you fall
[37:05] into many
[37:07] Temptations H count it Joy when you
[37:11] start going through a trial just start
[37:14] saying I got that joy joy joy joy down
[37:18] in my heart huh knowing this that's the
[37:22] trying of your faith amen worketh what
[37:27] one thing for sure if you're going
[37:30] through a
[37:31] trial and you're having problems with it
[37:34] God saying you don't have enough
[37:35] patience yeah right cuz remember if
[37:38] you're a son he's absolutely he's he's
[37:41] that tutor he's the one that's moving
[37:43] you over and showing you this and giving
[37:45] you this way but he's not a do old
[37:48] granddaddy now right he's not one that's
[37:50] going to clear all this out of the way
[37:51] no you're going to go through trials but
[37:54] it's what you do at the end of that
[37:55] trial right right that's right right
[37:58] brother Bram said it's not what you
[38:00] overcome it's how you overcome it all
[38:02] right so the how is how you overcome it
[38:05] with patience let patience have her
[38:08] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[38:11] entire wanting nothing all right have
[38:14] patience have patience with
[38:17] god
[38:19] listen we've
[38:21] waited a long
[38:25] time for body
[38:28] change sight and
[38:30] time is God's two worst enemies right
[38:33] because you and I are what what is sight
[38:36] sight and time time is patience right
[38:39] right
[38:41] patience and what what we see I thought
[38:46] we're supposed to believe to see not see
[38:48] to believe amen so how many of you seen
[38:51] a body
[38:54] change how many of you saw Jesus down on
[38:56] the
[38:58] cross how many of you saw Jesus Take
[39:03] Stripes how many of you have seen that
[39:06] so how do you know it's true that's
[39:10] right how do you know it's
[39:12] true something in your heart takes you
[39:16] back to that time that it happened now
[39:20] if that don't take you back you don't
[39:21] have that in here there's that virtue
[39:23] that virtue is taking you back to that
[39:25] and I'm drawing strength from something
[39:27] I can't even see
[39:29] right oh I see symbols I see pictures I
[39:32] see a cross right but do you see how
[39:35] much we actually do live by faith right
[39:39] we walk by faith not by sight
[39:43] right same thing with patience the
[39:46] trying of your faith worketh patience so
[39:49] God's going to try your
[39:51] faith for you to believe something you
[39:53] can't even see you have to believe
[39:56] believe that your children are already
[39:59] already saved Sanctified and filled with
[40:00] the Holy Ghost right amen husband wife
[40:06] whatever and you say well it's not
[40:10] happen have some patience right are you
[40:14] dead yet are they dead
[40:18] yet always a chance
[40:20] people but when you turn and let sight
[40:23] and time take over that's what our
[40:25] problem's been you see these people
[40:26] leaving the message they never had if
[40:29] they didn't if they did not have that
[40:31] substance faith when and get born again
[40:34] there's nothing for them to look to
[40:37] right but with that substance Faith
[40:39] inside that's what God brings us he
[40:41] brings us that substance Faith hey
[40:43] that's what was hanging on the cross
[40:45] right so he projects it now down to us
[40:50] and we got to believe it by faith right
[40:52] if you don't have that then you can be
[40:55] why you can be you have no Foundation
[40:56] ation you can be moved here you can be
[40:58] moved there you can get this you know
[41:00] you can get this Doctrine you get this
[41:01] you say brother R was wrong he was right
[41:03] and all these things you see what's
[41:05] happening the statue of perfect man is
[41:07] so ill taught nobody really knows how to
[41:09] get into it number one and how to go up
[41:13] it because nobody's teaching it right
[41:15] and really they're
[41:19] not all right now let's go to the next
[41:22] one which is
[41:25] godliness
[41:27] now we must have now what godliness
[41:29] Faith don't lose your faith but your
[41:32] faith has to become so
[41:34] Godly and I found something here I've
[41:36] been you know brother brandham really
[41:38] doesn't spend a lot of time on the
[41:40] Statue of a perfect man with godliness
[41:42] right he doesn't it's only just a few
[41:44] paragraphs that he spends on godliness
[41:46] if you've read the book but remember the
[41:48] whole thing is godliness but watch what
[41:50] he does watch what he brings in I'll
[41:52] read the quote in a minute and I think
[41:54] it's something that'll help you kind of
[41:56] like the control of temperance this is
[41:58] something that God showed me to what
[42:00] godliness is and it shows you whether
[42:02] you got it or not cuz see we're supposed
[42:03] to be like God when we get born again
[42:05] right right we're supposed to start
[42:07] acting like God when we're born again
[42:09] well why is this here if we're supposed
[42:11] to act it down here there's something
[42:13] about this and I'll read it to you in
[42:15] just a second but let's go to 1 Timothy
[42:19] 3:16 this is all this is where we were
[42:21] going to start some this morning but
[42:23] this is where we we'll uh hit God and
[42:26] brotherly kindness and without
[42:29] controversy so there's no controversy
[42:32] right great is the mystery of godliness
[42:35] right God was manifest In the Flesh
[42:38] justified in the spirit seen of angels
[42:40] preached unto the Gentiles believed on
[42:42] in the world and received up into glory
[42:45] amen now how many believe that amen
[42:48] without controversy then we must not
[42:50] have any controversy that that's what
[42:53] that
[42:54] is that that was was God that did that
[42:57] right and it's a mystery because the
[43:00] mystery comes in us right God's a
[43:02] mystery to the world but we're a Myster
[43:04] of the world because we're God here
[43:05] manifested on the earth now watch this
[43:07] go to 1 Timothy 4 Timothy talks a lot
[43:10] about this or Paul does but refuse
[43:13] profane and old wies fables and exercise
[43:16] thyself rather unto godliness there's
[43:18] that word again exercise for bodily
[43:21] exercise profiteth little which it does
[43:24] a little but godliness is profitable
[43:27] unto all things right all right having
[43:31] promise of the life that now
[43:34] is and of that which is to come now what
[43:36] were we talking about there in in U in
[43:39] second Peter it says we're talking about
[43:40] life and godliness all right so this is
[43:43] life and
[43:45] godliness what you're doing is you're
[43:47] bringing the life that we're should have
[43:49] lived had they not going to fall you're
[43:50] bringing it back here right you got that
[43:54] that's what we're bringing back is the
[43:56] life that we should have Liv all right
[43:58] cuz remember that Genesis 126 man never
[44:00] fail that Genesis 126 man never had to
[44:03] say God forgive me of my sins right
[44:05] that's right so if we get back to
[44:08] thaten that's when the body change
[44:10] happen
[44:12] people this is a faithful saying and
[44:15] worthy of all acceptation
[44:18] right but godliness is profitable Uno
[44:21] all things having promise of the life
[44:24] that is now and of that which is to come
[44:26] right all right now let's go to the
[44:29] definition of
[44:35] godliness after oh I'm sorry let's go to
[44:38] 1 Timothy
[44:39] 6 I messed you up didn't I 1 Timothy 66
[44:44] but godliness with contentment is great
[44:47] gain I want you to think about that
[44:49] godliness with contentment in other
[44:51] words be content what settle patience
[44:55] temperance
[44:57] you see how that stacking on top of each
[44:58] other yeah godliness with contentment is
[45:01] great gain for we brought nothing into
[45:04] this world and is certain that we carry
[45:06] nothing out so all that you know we and
[45:09] it's fine I and I I really think we
[45:11] ought to be successful in life I think I
[45:13] don't think we ought to be just you know
[45:15] brain dead but I don't think that we
[45:18] should build our hopes
[45:19] on this world but on getting to that
[45:23] bringing that other world in
[45:24] manifestation cuz it's going to be way
[45:26] better than this godliness with
[45:29] contentment is great game I want you to
[45:30] listen to that and hold it now let's
[45:33] define what godliness
[45:36] is strong concordance is this is all it
[45:39] says about it reverent respect piety
[45:44] towards God now look at that word
[45:48] there
[45:50] right let's take that word let's read
[45:54] quote number 12
[45:56] this is from the statue of perfect man
[45:58] brother Brown says but if you got
[45:59] genuine Faith then put genuine virtue to
[46:02] it then genuine knowledge then genuine
[46:04] Temperance genuine patience see you're
[46:05] moving right on up the line fifthly add
[46:08] godliness oh my godliness to be added
[46:10] what does godliness mean I looked in
[46:12] four or five dictionaries and couldn't
[46:14] even find what it meant finally I was
[46:16] down at brother Jeff there and we found
[46:17] it in a dictionary godliness means to be
[46:20] like God oh my after you got faith
[46:22] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[46:23] then be like God you say I can't do it
[46:27] brother brandom oh yes you can right
[46:30] that's right then he's talking about
[46:32] read now what he reads is is he reads
[46:34] Matthew
[46:35] 5:48 be therefore perfect right but then
[46:38] he comes and reads keep scrolling up
[46:40] we're going to read this and then he
[46:41] actually goes to Ephesians and reads
[46:43] what we've been reading where the
[46:44] apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[46:46] evangelists is for the perfecting of the
[46:48] Saints you get way up here now before
[46:50] you're asked to do that all these things
[46:52] has to be added first then when you get
[46:55] up here here he's asking that you now to
[46:58] be perfect godliness Sons and Daughters
[47:00] of God how many things I could say along
[47:03] that line and he turns to Ephesians 4
[47:05] and he reads that scroll on up this is a
[47:07] I think this is a pretty long quote but
[47:09] he reads the same thing I read talking
[47:11] about the apostles prophets pastors
[47:12] teaching evangelist for the perfecting
[47:14] of the Saints who are the Saints the
[47:16] Sanctified ones amen the one started
[47:19] from down here right right so you got to
[47:23] be born again you got to be a saint
[47:24] before you can be a saint Sanctified one
[47:27] right then he talks about the perfecting
[47:29] of the Saints and going up perfect takes
[47:33] godliness you have to add to your faith
[47:36] godliness see he Ain left Faith so
[47:38] that's godliness Faith see you start off
[47:41] down here with virtue then you go to
[47:42] knowledge then you go to Temperance then
[47:44] you go to patience now you're on
[47:46] godliness then he talks about to be like
[47:48] Jesus keep scrolling
[47:51] up Godly always looking for one thing I
[47:56] always do that which pleases the father
[48:00] right always do that which pleases the
[48:03] father see yes sir always that's
[48:05] godliness see right all right so what
[48:08] we're doing now
[48:09] is we're looking at something cuz you
[48:12] know there's another form of
[48:16] godliness second Timothy tells you
[48:19] there's a form of they have a form of
[48:20] godliness but denying the power thereof
[48:23] a form of godliness not godliness a form
[48:25] of godliness but look what he's saying
[48:27] is always looking for one thing I always
[48:29] do that which pleases the father and I
[48:31] came to I was looking through a little
[48:33] more few more quotes and looking I
[48:35] thought Lord what what is something that
[48:37] we can do to make it we're supposed to
[48:40] be Godly here but why did you put
[48:42] godliness right here right before
[48:43] brotherly
[48:45] kindness here's what came to me take it
[48:49] for a grain of salt or you can take it
[48:50] from the Lord but godliness to me is a
[48:54] respect for the the gifts of
[48:58] God or the person that is gifted right
[49:01] right see you've come all the way up
[49:03] here this far you got all these virtues
[49:06] but there has to be something and
[49:08] because it it does it shows that
[49:10] godliness is a respect you must have a
[49:12] respect for the gifts of God once you
[49:15] get that far because look the next thing
[49:18] is what brotherly kindness right if you
[49:21] don't have you got to have respect for
[49:22] the gift of God first then you going to
[49:24] have to have respect for the
[49:26] Brethren got it see how they're stacking
[49:29] on top of each other respect for God
[49:32] remember have patience with God first
[49:35] have respect for God's word or God's
[49:37] gifts first then you're going to come to
[49:39] brotherly kindness and brotherly
[49:41] kindness is one that's going to you it's
[49:43] going to knock us off a little bit
[49:46] maybe brotherly
[49:48] kindness is tough but remember brotherly
[49:52] kind
[49:53] kindliness is right right at where God
[49:57] is getting ready to absolutely make you
[50:01] an instrument that he wants to use Glory
[50:04] right right but we got to get that one
[50:06] little thing out of the way called
[50:08] brotherly kindness so godliness faith is
[50:11] a respect for the gifts of God all the
[50:14] gifts of God we respect all you say well
[50:16] no it's not you say well that's speaking
[50:19] in tongues why does everybody go to that
[50:21] one those are the last ones yeah the
[50:23] gifts of God is what wisdom faith and
[50:26] all those spiritual gifts we come there
[50:28] and we see that now we need that kind of
[50:31] godliness to take us up one more part
[50:35] higher we must have respect
[50:39] yeah respect for each other is what's
[50:42] coming up but respect for God respect
[50:46] for the gifts of God and know where
[50:48] they're placed and you know what know
[50:50] how to use them because what did Jesus
[50:52] do I always do that which pleases my
[50:56] father right so did Jesus do anything
[51:00] that didn't please the father if he
[51:01] didn't the scriptures wrong right you
[51:03] say well he did this he did
[51:06] that I always do that which pleases the
[51:10] father
[51:12] amen did Jesus have respect yeah I think
[51:14] he did he had respect to the father
[51:16] didn't he right didn't he right he put
[51:20] all the honor on the father right right
[51:23] he had respect that's the godliness un I
[51:25] going to have to have is what it's not
[51:27] up here where you say I got godliness
[51:30] you got to come to me I like what
[51:32] brother Chris is not here but he's in
[51:34] the back and I'm sure he won't mind me
[51:35] saying he walked out there and he said
[51:37] I'm sure you're telling I'm sure glad
[51:38] you're telling these people how to treat
[51:44] me think about that a little while he
[51:47] was laughing and I know what he was
[51:49] talking about he was talking about
[51:50] himself he said I'm sure glad you
[51:51] telling these people how to treat
[51:54] me but really I mean and really you got
[51:56] to be that way you can't say well I get
[51:58] up here and you go well I've got all
[52:00] these great
[52:01] gifts see that would be no respect there
[52:05] right you everybody understand what I'm
[52:06] saying there'd be no respect there
[52:08] there'd be no godliness I could have all
[52:10] these other virtues and not have the
[52:12] godliness about myself to know that to
[52:14] respect that I know where that gift come
[52:16] from right I know where the gift in
[52:18] Brother Rich Marlo all you everybody
[52:20] everybody's gifted right but you got to
[52:22] have respect for that gift when you come
[52:25] to right there because you know what you
[52:26] fixing get real close to that person
[52:29] yeah right right you know Temperance is
[52:31] something you got to work
[52:33] on patience is something you got to work
[52:37] on brotherly kindness is really
[52:39] something you got to work
[52:41] on but you working on it with somebody
[52:46] else and it's brotherly
[52:49] kindness see you can have patience and
[52:51] have patience with the world you can
[52:52] have Temperance and have Temperance you
[52:54] know with the world but brotherly
[52:56] kindness that's you and your brother
[52:58] amen so it's bringing it right into the
[53:00] family and we're seeing that sure it's
[53:02] all in the family but but godliness is a
[53:04] respect for the gifts of God so remember
[53:07] that I believe that's what brother Bram
[53:08] was trying to say is having respect of
[53:11] where it came
[53:13] from how it got to you and how you're
[53:15] using it remember power without
[53:18] character to me that's a character
[53:20] godliness is a character that we need to
[53:23] show respect for the of God and then of
[53:26] course 2 Timothy 3: 4-7 I just threw
[53:29] that in there because it's a different
[53:30] kind of godliness it's a form of
[53:32] godliness right you can't listen the
[53:34] form of godliness is right here you
[53:36] can't even get in the body having a form
[53:38] of godliness that's religion religion is
[53:41] a form of
[53:43] godliness cuz they want to act like I
[53:45] said many times you know they they get
[53:47] religious around you right traitors he
[53:50] high- minded lovers of pleasure more
[53:52] than lovers of God having a form of
[53:55] godliness but denying the what power
[53:58] thereof in other words not showing
[54:01] respect for the gifts amen not showing
[54:04] respect for the gift they're denying the
[54:07] power they're actually they're denying
[54:09] where it come
[54:10] from from such turn away and it tells
[54:13] you what to do so let's go now to
[54:15] brotherly kindness
[54:20] Faith next one next chart brotherly
[54:23] kindness faith we going we coming right
[54:25] up here to the top all right bless
[54:28] you brotherly
[54:32] kindness all right we going to we're
[54:35] going to read a few quotes here but
[54:37] brotherly
[54:39] kindness Romans 12 let love be without
[54:43] dis
[54:44] stimulation upour that which is evil
[54:47] cleave to that which is good be kind
[54:50] affectioned one to another with
[54:52] Brotherly Love cuz remember brotherly
[54:53] love and kind brotherly kindness is the
[54:55] same thing yeah all right brother love
[54:56] brother kindness is the same thing in
[54:58] honor preferring one another what I tell
[55:01] you about godliness respect to the gifts
[55:04] now you're going to start respecting the
[55:06] person right oh it's easier to respect
[55:09] the gift sometimes it's not easy to
[55:11] respect the person so that's what we're
[55:13] getting to though you got to do it
[55:15] that's the last Point let me make this
[55:18] point look that's the last point before
[55:20] God puts that
[55:22] seal right right what is the Holy Spirit
[55:25] the holy spirit's a what a seal right
[55:27] right the Holy Spirit we're sealed right
[55:29] here until the day of our Redemption
[55:31] absolutely in our soul but when we get
[55:33] to right here God's going to put another
[55:35] stamp on you it's not another Holy Ghost
[55:37] but it's going to be a stamp that the
[55:38] world's going to be able to see I hope
[55:41] right but Romans 12: 9-10 let love be
[55:44] without ass stimulation you read that
[55:45] now let's go to 1 Thessalonians 4 he
[55:49] therefore that despises despises not man
[55:52] but
[55:54] God
[55:55] all right so now if we despise a person
[55:59] if that person has God in them and he's
[56:01] at at godliness we despise that person
[56:04] we got a
[56:05] problem we got a problem with God
[56:08] right because you're not despising the
[56:10] man but God right who hath also given
[56:14] unto us his holy spirit but that
[56:17] touching brotherly love you need not
[56:19] that I write unto you for ye yourselves
[56:21] are taught of God to love one another
[56:24] this shouldn't be a hard one but it's
[56:26] the hardest one it's right up there at
[56:28] the top all right for you yourselves are
[56:30] taught of God to love one another so
[56:32] we're supposed to do that so now let's
[56:35] go to the
[56:37] definition of Brotherly kindness which
[56:40] you know what that is it's Philadelphia
[56:41] that's what that
[56:43] means Brotherly Love brotherly kindness
[56:45] love of the Brethren love of brothers or
[56:47] sisters brotherly love and the New
[56:49] Testament the love which Christians
[56:51] cherish for each other as Brethren now
[56:54] the problem that we have is the problem
[56:56] and we'll read it here in just a minute
[56:58] from Brother brandom the problem we have
[57:00] is is we say well if brother Dale loves
[57:02] us L loves us I love him yeah that's the
[57:06] way we want to be yeah right that's the
[57:08] way we want to be we we don't want to be
[57:10] the one that portrays the love first we
[57:12] want him to love us and then it'll be
[57:14] easier for us to love him or anybody I
[57:17] put anybody in that place it's really
[57:20] you know if Jesus said the two greatest
[57:22] Commandments and we read them was the
[57:24] the Lord your God is one and love your
[57:26] neighbor as you love yourself now look I
[57:28] got two neighbors that are
[57:34] gay pick that one
[57:37] up I've got to love them as much as I
[57:40] love me regardless of what they
[57:42] do CU there's no
[57:45] stipulation but remember through this
[57:47] whole thing it's got to be an overcoming
[57:49] it'd be real
[57:51] easy if brother Al and sister Anna lived
[57:53] on one side of me and brother how and
[57:55] sister already lived on the other side
[57:57] and you know Mom and Daddy live on down
[57:59] here and Anna and Richard and Terence
[58:00] and Lis you know but they're sticking
[58:02] right beside
[58:04] me is something that you got to deal
[58:06] with but it'd be easy if we had a
[58:09] commune with all of us that live there
[58:12] we all live there we all praise the Lord
[58:13] and we all did that's too
[58:16] easy that's too
[58:18] easy you know put a Richard Marlo in
[58:20] your yard and see what
[58:23] happens
[58:25] boy if he was just a lot nicer I'd be a
[58:27] lot nicer to him that's not what this
[58:30] is this is what love of brothers and
[58:36] sisters not the love they give you it's
[58:39] the love you project to them all right
[58:42] and I'm being serious cuz look this is
[58:44] this is to me this is the hinge point if
[58:46] we get through
[58:50] this that's the whole thing I believe
[58:52] that's what's stopping I know it's
[58:53] what's stopping me and I'll just admit
[58:55] it I you got to have brotherly kindness
[58:58] and you give it you know we give all
[58:59] kind of examples but the the greatest
[59:01] example is that you love that you got to
[59:03] love that neighbor unconditionally
[59:05] doesn't matter if he loves you doesn't
[59:06] matter if he's a Christian doesn't
[59:10] matter let's look what see what brother
[59:12] Brown says quote number
[59:15] 13 that's another one another U part of
[59:20] a uh definition but let's read this look
[59:23] 6ly let's add the Bible said add
[59:25] Brotherly Love brotherly kindness now
[59:27] that's a good one right here the six
[59:29] seventh all right adding brotherly
[59:30] kindness all right when we get to that
[59:33] brotherly kindness put yourself in his
[59:35] place on the matter now you say my
[59:39] brother sinned against me said Peter
[59:41] shall I forgive him he said seven times
[59:43] a
[59:44] day Jesus said 70 times seven which
[59:48] those of us that don't can't add can't
[59:50] Cipher that's 490
[59:53] times a day yeah yeah that's not a
[59:57] weekly or a yearly quot that's a day
[1:00:00] brotherly kindness now you see if a
[1:00:02] brother is All Out Of Tune don't be
[1:00:04] impatient with him see see that's where
[1:00:06] it comes down to patience see no see be
[1:00:08] kind to him go anyway someone said not
[1:00:10] long ago how can you believe these
[1:00:12] things the way you do and still go to
[1:00:14] the Assemblies of God and the want
[1:00:15] that's all the
[1:00:16] rest then put see brotherly kindness see
[1:00:19] see hoping someday see patient with him
[1:00:22] see temperent enduring
[1:00:25] he's going through this whole list
[1:00:26] knowledge to understand what he believes
[1:00:30] remember it's in his heart that's what
[1:00:33] is virtue in yourself to let it go out
[1:00:36] with kindness meekness to him having
[1:00:39] faith that someday God will bring him in
[1:00:41] now he used every one of those virtues
[1:00:43] right there right stacked them right on
[1:00:45] top of each other just like we've been
[1:00:46] doing you wonder where we get this from
[1:00:49] right he got it first brotherly kindness
[1:00:52] the seventh Thing 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7
[1:00:55] brother R Taps on the chalkboard seven
[1:00:57] things now you're coming next thing then
[1:00:58] at charity which is love that's the
[1:01:00] capping Stone and then we're going to
[1:01:02] get to that maybe when we get back from
[1:01:04] brother Joe greens not this Sunday but
[1:01:07] the next all right let's go to number
[1:01:10] 14 let's read this one here now you
[1:01:13] might say look I sure don't like brother
[1:01:15] Neville I sure don't like brother Jones
[1:01:17] I don't like brother so and so and
[1:01:18] something like that but just let
[1:01:20] something happen to him brother your
[1:01:21] heart's broke he just nearly killed you
[1:01:23] say we can obtain brotherly kindness and
[1:01:26] feeling for one another see but to
[1:01:28] maintain in a group of people now look
[1:01:31] he's making a point here I want you to
[1:01:33] stop he's making a point we can obtain
[1:01:36] brotherly kindness and feeling for for
[1:01:38] for one for another if it's one for one
[1:01:41] right here right but when you get a
[1:01:43] group of people that don't like that guy
[1:01:46] yeah see right here but to maintain in a
[1:01:49] group of people where's Benjamin where's
[1:01:53] Michael
[1:01:56] we can obtain that why do you care for
[1:01:58] that brother because you broke bread
[1:02:00] with him here at the altar as you will
[1:02:01] tonight we're actually going to break
[1:02:02] bread tonight we're taking communion you
[1:02:04] fellowship with him you shook his hand
[1:02:06] you worship with him he's your brother
[1:02:08] and he might do something in the flesh
[1:02:11] that you would disagree with because you
[1:02:12] just kind of stay what you ought and do
[1:02:15] but shun him a little bit Yeah but in
[1:02:17] the bottom of your heart if something
[1:02:18] happened to that brother it would just
[1:02:20] nearly kill you or that sister now if we
[1:02:24] have such a hatred toward people that we
[1:02:26] want to see something bad happen to
[1:02:28] people we're in trouble right you need
[1:02:31] to go back down to justification you're
[1:02:33] on that shoots and Ladder game where you
[1:02:36] think you're going to be almost at the
[1:02:38] Aaron in that right Aaron play Shoots
[1:02:40] and Ladders last night Shoots and
[1:02:43] Ladders you get right up there to almost
[1:02:44] at the top and there's a big old ladder
[1:02:46] that goes all the way down to the bottom
[1:02:49] how many of you played that raise your
[1:02:50] hand you rest of you are secret
[1:02:53] centers
[1:02:56] but you slide all the way down to the
[1:02:59] bottom what is bro dick it's a board
[1:03:03] game and it has ladders that when you
[1:03:06] hit it you can climb up and you go to
[1:03:07] another it's like a journey and then if
[1:03:09] you get up to a certain spot and you hit
[1:03:11] that point there's a ladder and you have
[1:03:13] to slide all the way down and start all
[1:03:15] over again playing with dice and stuff
[1:03:17] like that
[1:03:23] so
[1:03:25] well you made a statement I want that
[1:03:28] cover I never you want be on secret
[1:03:30] Center did
[1:03:32] you but a lot of us played I mean it's a
[1:03:35] popular game right for those of us that
[1:03:37] lived out in the country We we played
[1:03:40] with uh played with those kind of games
[1:03:42] those those were neat and that was good
[1:03:44] times you know there was no television
[1:03:46] program we didn't have to worry about
[1:03:48] that we grew up without a TV so we
[1:03:49] played board
[1:03:50] games so but anyway shoot some ladders
[1:03:53] that's the way it is with this look he
[1:03:54] said you come up this far and then you
[1:03:57] know all the way down to the bottom if
[1:03:59] you can't love listen now and this is
[1:04:02] the point I want to
[1:04:04] make there's people that humanly you
[1:04:07] don't like to be
[1:04:09] around right okay right brother brandom
[1:04:12] even said and I wasn't going to bring
[1:04:13] the quote cuz I don't want to deal too
[1:04:14] much on that side of it he said there's
[1:04:16] Christians that you can't stand to be in
[1:04:17] the room with yeah because of the Clash
[1:04:20] of your Natures but like he said right
[1:04:23] here if something happens to that
[1:04:26] brother right first thing you say you
[1:04:28] don't say first thing you should say is
[1:04:30] God have mercy you know but instead of
[1:04:32] going well he deserved that no you know
[1:04:35] that's like this I I don't didn't mean
[1:04:37] to bring it out but just like this this
[1:04:39] aao
[1:04:40] spafford all them secret all them people
[1:04:43] back in Chicago was saying hey he must
[1:04:45] have done something wrong right he was a
[1:04:47] sinner he done something wrong God
[1:04:49] punished him for doing all that no he
[1:04:51] was right there in the will of God right
[1:04:54] to write that song that I believe will
[1:04:56] be sung for eternity we'll sing these
[1:04:58] songs for an
[1:04:59] eternity because I believe it's a it's
[1:05:01] part of the growth
[1:05:04] process of the man and they were saying
[1:05:07] that it was something that God done to
[1:05:09] him right you have to be careful
[1:05:12] brotherly kindness you have to be real
[1:05:14] careful with in all sincerity that is
[1:05:17] the place where we all need a lot of
[1:05:20] help
[1:05:22] amen first thing if some does something
[1:05:24] to you what's the first thing you want
[1:05:25] to do get back at them yeah first thing
[1:05:29] you want to do I want to get back at
[1:05:31] them I want to do something that he has
[1:05:32] made me uncomfortable that beard on
[1:05:35] brother klie is bugging the Hound out of
[1:05:40] me do I looks like
[1:05:43] Uncle I don't think I've ever seen him
[1:05:45] with a beard so it's aggravating me I'm
[1:05:49] I'm tired of it brother stop
[1:05:53] it
[1:05:54] get over I'll get over
[1:05:57] it brotherly kindness that shouldn't
[1:06:00] have anything to do with anything you
[1:06:02] understand what I'm saying it's like uh
[1:06:04] uh sister Anna kamani she's kind of my
[1:06:06] she's kind of my Rudder every once in a
[1:06:08] while she's and she's very smart
[1:06:10] intellectual she said brother Wade
[1:06:12] that's not the first sermon brother
[1:06:13] Brandon preached was Faith you don't
[1:06:15] know that that's the first sermon he
[1:06:16] preached and I don't know if that's the
[1:06:17] first sermon he preached but it's the
[1:06:19] first sermon on tape that he preached so
[1:06:21] I need to make it so I need to make it I
[1:06:23] need to make make it right she's
[1:06:25] crawling under the seat now but I need
[1:06:28] to really I do I need I hey I get that
[1:06:30] from all of you and I appreciate that I
[1:06:32] I I hope that that brother Dale all of
[1:06:35] us ministers are so approachable that
[1:06:37] you can come and say hey that's
[1:06:39] not that just wasn't exactly right what
[1:06:42] you should have done or or you like her
[1:06:44] you know she said you need to explain
[1:06:45] that cuz you don't know the fast the
[1:06:46] first sermon and that's the truth and I
[1:06:48] appreciate that you know what that
[1:06:51] didn't make me not like her that's right
[1:06:53] that makes me you know love her more as
[1:06:55] a sister to know that somebody's
[1:06:57] listening because somebody on the
[1:06:59] Internet or somebody that's just come
[1:07:00] here the first time they if they search
[1:07:02] through the the uh you know look through
[1:07:05] and they say well that was not the first
[1:07:07] sermon he preached he started preaching
[1:07:08] in 1920 something and here it is 1940
[1:07:11] something that's not the first it's
[1:07:12] confusion we need to stop the confusion
[1:07:14] and I'm sorry because I caused that it
[1:07:16] was the first sermon we know that
[1:07:18] brother Brandon put on tape for us to
[1:07:20] listen to was faith is the substance so
[1:07:23] I thank you for that not to embarrass
[1:07:25] you at all I know it didn't your face is
[1:07:28] not
[1:07:32] red where you at
[1:07:36] Michael but brotherly kindness listen
[1:07:38] like I said it's really easy though for
[1:07:40] us to love each other really should be
[1:07:41] easy for Christians to love each other
[1:07:44] it really should but sometimes it's not
[1:07:47] just like that now if I would have been
[1:07:49] some people being a preacher and some
[1:07:53] woman
[1:07:54] tell me that I did something wrong and
[1:07:58] says you need to correct it oh her head
[1:08:02] would have hit the floor and rolled all
[1:08:03] the way to the back some preachers
[1:08:06] couldn't have stood it till they got in
[1:08:07] the pull pit and did that amen seen it
[1:08:10] happen before many times we have to be
[1:08:13] careful we have people come in here and
[1:08:15] I've seen ministers at Fellowship
[1:08:16] meetings a girl woman comes in and sits
[1:08:18] down in the front row and her hair is
[1:08:20] real short first sermon she's ever been
[1:08:22] to now how's brotherly kind is going to
[1:08:24] be projected when he stands right here
[1:08:25] and goes cutting your hairs of the devil
[1:08:28] and you
[1:08:33] know you're right that ain't a lot of
[1:08:36] any of that that's
[1:08:38] right definitely
[1:08:40] knowledge probably even the Holy Ghost
[1:08:44] cuz
[1:08:45] look brotherly kindness is preferring
[1:08:48] your brother before yourself Jesus did
[1:08:51] not die for hisself right
[1:08:55] he died for me and
[1:08:57] you he didn't have to die he was God
[1:09:01] Almighty he didn't have to come down
[1:09:03] here and do this but he wanted
[1:09:06] to because you know why he wanted he's
[1:09:09] so
[1:09:10] unselfish he owned all these virtues
[1:09:13] before there ever was one Adam right
[1:09:16] like brother D's been preaching for
[1:09:18] anything he was those virtues but he did
[1:09:22] not want to be alone with those virtues
[1:09:25] right because
[1:09:27] look how you going to have any of them
[1:09:29] without having somebody to project it to
[1:09:32] that's right that's so he's got a family
[1:09:34] now he's got sons and daughters that he
[1:09:36] projects this to and expects us to live
[1:09:39] it if we believe that that's what he
[1:09:42] came for was to give us these what gifts
[1:09:46] these virtues are gifts that God's give
[1:09:49] us so let's use them as we comeing on up
[1:09:51] a little bit further man you're right
[1:09:53] here brotherly kindness you you know you
[1:09:55] get all these things working in your
[1:09:56] life you uh have respect for God's gift
[1:10:00] and then you got to have respect for the
[1:10:02] person all right let's look at
[1:10:06] number quote number
[1:10:09] 15 we'll be finished here in just a
[1:10:11] second I'll let you chew on this till we
[1:10:13] start back over in a couple weeks look
[1:10:16] if Pentecost was God's Vine This is I
[1:10:18] will restore this is not in the Statue
[1:10:19] of perfect man
[1:10:21] book how this is the one that's going
[1:10:24] this is one yall see if you can swallow
[1:10:27] if Pentecost was God's Vine which was
[1:10:28] the new Vine that has grown up then
[1:10:30] these four destroyers has been the one
[1:10:33] that eat the vine down now you remember
[1:10:35] the Palmer worm Locust caterpillar all
[1:10:38] that all right that's what he's talking
[1:10:39] about now let's find out what Pentecost
[1:10:42] had now not 1906 let me explain that not
[1:10:46] 1906 Pentecost but the true Pentecost
[1:10:49] the one that started right down here in
[1:10:50] the first church age all right there in
[1:10:53] in and right after the death of Jesus
[1:10:55] and coming back on the day of Pentecost
[1:10:57] all right find out the Destroyer who
[1:10:59] they are well what did it now the first
[1:11:01] thing that Pentecost produced was
[1:11:04] brotherly love that's
[1:11:06] right it tore down the middle wall of
[1:11:09] petitions and made a Brotherhood cuz you
[1:11:11] see what Pentecost done in 1906 it
[1:11:13] totally reversed that right they started
[1:11:16] putting walls up they started putting
[1:11:18] petitions up brother Bown said you've
[1:11:20] you've cabbage down you've stopped here
[1:11:22] well the first Pentecost not so they are
[1:11:24] not a total pattern of the first
[1:11:26] Pentecost all right it tore down the
[1:11:28] middle wall of petitions and made a
[1:11:30] Brotherhood to such a way they had
[1:11:33] everything in common in the Bible Days A
[1:11:36] brotherhood
[1:11:38] right that's right this is where
[1:11:41] downstairs it got a little bit
[1:11:45] touchy I told y'all today to bring make
[1:11:48] sure you brought your cash did you bring
[1:11:50] all your cash did you bring your
[1:11:52] checkbook title to your house and all
[1:11:54] your
[1:11:55] cars no you're supposed to give them all
[1:11:58] to brother Dale and me brother Terrence
[1:12:01] brother Louise brother Lise quit
[1:12:07] smiling that's what they did in the
[1:12:08] first church
[1:12:10] age that's what brother brandham said
[1:12:13] was to such a way they had everything in
[1:12:16] common you remember brother Paul spoke
[1:12:19] of Brotherhood and he gave all the gifts
[1:12:20] of the Pentecostal church and he said
[1:12:22] First Corinthians Lord speak with tongue
[1:12:23] and Angels not have charity but what do
[1:12:25] he
[1:12:26] do they brought all the money in they
[1:12:30] trusted now how about trusting a brother
[1:12:33] how about trusting Peter who can't even
[1:12:36] write yeah so he can't make an invoice
[1:12:40] but they just piled everything in and
[1:12:42] they gave as was needed in the first
[1:12:44] church age that was brotherly
[1:12:47] love that's what he said right right boy
[1:12:51] it's good and quiet
[1:12:57] but
[1:12:59] remember ananas and Safara was part of
[1:13:02] that group right now what did they
[1:13:05] do they sold all their goods listen this
[1:13:08] is what they done they sold all their
[1:13:10] goods they did what the disciples said
[1:13:14] they sold all their goods but when they
[1:13:16] walked in before Peter Peter said is
[1:13:18] this all they said yes or he did said
[1:13:22] yes this is
[1:13:25] all Peter discerned that if he got
[1:13:29] $20,000 he only brought 10 into the pot
[1:13:31] he kept 10 for
[1:13:34] himself and what happened to him he fell
[1:13:37] dead right there Peter said you've not
[1:13:39] lied to me you've lied to the Holy
[1:13:43] Ghost so now what I'm telling you today
[1:13:46] is you don't have to bring your money
[1:13:47] and your cash and all that we don't need
[1:13:49] it but I want you to start bringing all
[1:13:53] to these Services right sir bring
[1:13:55] everything you got every title deed to
[1:13:59] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:14:02] everything you got you bring to this
[1:14:04] service right amen and don't leave it at
[1:14:07] that door right you bring it right here
[1:14:11] that's right I don't want your money
[1:14:12] brother don't want your money we don't
[1:14:13] need it but that's what they did though
[1:14:16] that was brotherly kindness you know
[1:14:18] what they did they trusted those
[1:14:20] Brethren so much till they did here I
[1:14:23] just I just sold my house I just sold
[1:14:25] all my cattle and here's the money you
[1:14:28] do with it what God tells you to do with
[1:14:30] it right that's how much they trusted
[1:14:33] not just the gift of God anymore they
[1:14:35] trust the people with the gift right you
[1:14:37] see how this are stacking on top of each
[1:14:39] other you got to respect the
[1:14:42] gift but you got to respect where it
[1:14:45] come from right they respected them so
[1:14:47] much now this is right before the
[1:14:50] headstone now remember they didn't get
[1:14:52] that
[1:14:55] the first church age didn't get they
[1:14:56] have no they didn't get the headstone
[1:14:57] they didn't get Christ in his fullness
[1:14:59] but they got so
[1:15:01] close till they gave everything they had
[1:15:04] because remember what when Jesus hung on
[1:15:05] the cross did he hold something
[1:15:08] back he gave all he gave everything he
[1:15:12] had for me and you so why can't we in
[1:15:16] turn turn around and give it all back to
[1:15:18] him everything we do all the work that
[1:15:21] we do whether it be natural whether it
[1:15:24] be spiritual whether it be anyway let's
[1:15:26] roll it up again right
[1:15:27] here Jesus said this will all men know
[1:15:31] that you're my disciples when you have
[1:15:34] love one for the other Pentecost had it
[1:15:39] right I'm speaking Pentecost meaning the
[1:15:41] first group of Apostles and the
[1:15:42] disciples they had that Brotherly Love
[1:15:46] they wasn't
[1:15:48] greedy they sold everything they had and
[1:15:52] for the further for the the furthering
[1:15:54] of the church the only way you going to
[1:15:56] get make this church
[1:15:58] profitable is come here do what God Said
[1:16:02] and you know what God's going to have to
[1:16:04] give you a blessing he's going to have
[1:16:05] to cuz he said I'll give you a blessing
[1:16:07] that you can't contain amen all right
[1:16:10] they sold everything they had for the
[1:16:12] furthering of the church they were so
[1:16:14] together till even when one heard of the
[1:16:16] other one died they said let's go and
[1:16:18] die with him such a
[1:16:22] Feeling
[1:16:23] can you say that about yourself
[1:16:26] amen can you see brother Donnie or or
[1:16:29] brother Joe or anybody in a situation I
[1:16:31] I told Brother how and I meant it from
[1:16:33] the bottom of my heart I said if I could
[1:16:35] take that away from you and give it to
[1:16:37] me I'd take
[1:16:38] it that's where you got to be that's
[1:16:41] where you got to be now let's don't be
[1:16:44] foolish and say God take the cancer off
[1:16:46] of this when to give you know don't
[1:16:47] let's don't be foolish right but if a
[1:16:49] man's sick what's brother Brown say the
[1:16:52] little girl the little the little woman
[1:16:54] that was sitting on the row that had a
[1:16:57] sick
[1:16:58] baby a mother came around laid hands on
[1:17:02] her and he said that's where the baby
[1:17:04] got her healing exactly why that lady
[1:17:07] entered into brotherly love because you
[1:17:10] know what if a sister's having a
[1:17:14] problem I can't relate to that right
[1:17:17] right but if a brother has a problem I
[1:17:20] can relate to that and enter into that
[1:17:22] problem so you sisters are have just as
[1:17:25] much of responsibility to enter in if if
[1:17:28] one sister's having problem or two
[1:17:29] sisters having problem enter into that
[1:17:31] don't separate yourself from it enter
[1:17:34] into it and I meant that with brother
[1:17:35] how many you know you look at people and
[1:17:37] you say man if I could just take that
[1:17:39] away from him right just give it to me
[1:17:41] I'll take it that's what Jesus said
[1:17:44] wasn't he right right cast your burdens
[1:17:47] on me I'm not making me Jesus but we're
[1:17:49] supposed to act like him right right
[1:17:52] that's why brother Dale has has problems
[1:17:53] in his
[1:17:55] body I told him the other day I said
[1:17:57] you're just like brother Jess you do
[1:17:58] everything I'm going to say it you do
[1:18:00] everything you don't have no delegation
[1:18:02] skills you don't tell people to go do
[1:18:04] this do this do this you do it all
[1:18:06] yourself brother Jess treml was the same
[1:18:08] way 75 years old he had a
[1:18:12] stroke your body listen your body is the
[1:18:16] Temple of the Holy Ghost but your body
[1:18:17] is still under sin your body is still
[1:18:20] under sin and has the effects of it
[1:18:22] listen
[1:18:23] we're all getting
[1:18:24] older this is falling out
[1:18:28] okay I told him other day I said I don't
[1:18:30] know how in the world you preach three
[1:18:31] sermons work two jobs and built my house
[1:18:33] and terence's house and Anna's house I
[1:18:35] don't know how he did it after two
[1:18:37] Services doing this I'm dead dog tired
[1:18:40] why cuz it's a strain it's a strain look
[1:18:43] at brother brandom he was 56 years old
[1:18:45] I'm 55 he was 56 when he died he looked
[1:18:48] about 70 he was old why Jesus he was 30
[1:18:53] years old they thought he was 50 why
[1:18:55] because the
[1:18:58] man had brotherly kindness he took
[1:19:02] on he took on the sins of the world
[1:19:04] Jesus did and then us we must bear each
[1:19:07] other's burden and we
[1:19:09] should I don't want brother how to be
[1:19:11] sick he's been sick for weeks I don't
[1:19:13] want no more of that right and I don't
[1:19:15] have to physically take that on but you
[1:19:17] know what it's like brother Dale did
[1:19:18] that day he took a quarter and said here
[1:19:20] let me buy your headache right well that
[1:19:22] wasn't Wizardry that was faith that was
[1:19:25] putting confidence in somebody say here
[1:19:28] I want to take that from you that's the
[1:19:30] same way we're brotherly kindness we
[1:19:32] must now bind together not be all
[1:19:34] lovey-dovey because you know what the
[1:19:35] world and and people that have a um that
[1:19:39] doesn't have the new birth they take it
[1:19:40] to like you're talking about cuz
[1:19:43] remember brother Bram said agapy
[1:19:45] love then fil your love then what lust
[1:19:49] then it just keeps going it keeps
[1:19:51] deteriorating all the way down all right
[1:19:53] OS and all that stuff cuz what they're
[1:19:55] doing is our in our being we're supposed
[1:19:58] to love a Creator a god something we're
[1:20:01] supposed to love something cuz that's
[1:20:03] what we're supposed to love right and
[1:20:06] what happens with Satan is is he brings
[1:20:08] it over this way and brings it into OS
[1:20:11] fil your love and all those things over
[1:20:13] here God has got agop love and it never
[1:20:15] moves it stays right here it's constant
[1:20:18] it stays right there yeah exactly that's
[1:20:20] who he is that's the head stone that
[1:20:23] we're missing right that hopefully that
[1:20:26] we can get into but I like this right
[1:20:29] here where this is some people go
[1:20:30] berserk but I like that right there
[1:20:32] right where it says holy spirit we'll
[1:20:34] we'll get into that in a couple of
[1:20:36] Sundays let's stand but brotherly
[1:20:38] kindness put yourself in that person's
[1:20:43] position before you start judging right
[1:20:46] or anything all
[1:20:49] right I hope that kind of helped you a
[1:20:51] little bit further on into godliness God
[1:20:54] but remember
[1:20:57] godliness godliness is a respect for the
[1:21:00] gifts of God right all right then when
[1:21:03] you go up a little bit higher if that
[1:21:05] listen if your
[1:21:08] filter says that brother Dale has a gift
[1:21:12] of God then you must respect the gift of
[1:21:15] God but you must respect the person to
[1:21:17] go along with it right
[1:21:20] right cuz look how bad they got with
[1:21:22] Brown they said oh we respect the
[1:21:25] gift when it was working with a
[1:21:28] discernment but when he's
[1:21:30] preaching how messed up can that be
[1:21:33] right I mean how messed up can that be
[1:21:36] God can't keep his word straight now
[1:21:38] those people had a different attitude
[1:21:41] than they should have had if they would
[1:21:43] have brotherly kindness say old Dr
[1:21:45] Bosworth he had brotherly kindness he
[1:21:48] said oh brother brandom you need to get
[1:21:49] on the field you need to get out there
[1:21:51] before everybody you know before brother
[1:21:52] Bosworth died he's telling brother bam
[1:21:55] all these things he needed to do well
[1:21:57] now he could have been like the rest of
[1:21:58] them and said well now you know you're
[1:21:59] don't go out there doing any preaching
[1:22:01] no he said get on the field get out
[1:22:03] there before the fanaticism gets out
[1:22:05] there so we must
[1:22:08] find the
[1:22:09] gifts where they're coming from respect
[1:22:12] them and then respect of our
[1:22:16] brothers brotherly
[1:22:20] kindness kind of hard to do yeah Jesus
[1:22:23] said love your neighbor as you love
[1:22:26] yourself right think about that think
[1:22:30] about that we're fixing to take
[1:22:32] communion and we need to we need to
[1:22:35] really as we're taking communion realize
[1:22:39] that as Sons and Daughters of
[1:22:42] God it's a it's a requirement it's it's
[1:22:45] something that we we're supposed to do
[1:22:47] as Christians we're supposed to take
[1:22:48] communion but now if you're not a
[1:22:50] Christian then you're not supposed to to
[1:22:52] take communion cuz if you do then then
[1:22:55] you're you're harming yourself now
[1:22:57] what's a Christian Christlike right
[1:23:00] that's someone born again all right and
[1:23:02] if you don't then you see all these
[1:23:04] things and and you see brother was going
[1:23:07] to read it in just a minute you're going
[1:23:08] to see that there's things that there's
[1:23:10] blessings and there's cursings right all
[1:23:12] right so as we take communion it should
[1:23:15] be the Born Again believer or brother
[1:23:17] bam even said those believing
[1:23:20] unto but now not just because you want
[1:23:23] to drink some wine and eat some bread
[1:23:25] right that's why communion with the
[1:23:28] brotherly kindness that's why they all
[1:23:30] had everything in common there was not
[1:23:32] one I love that where St Martin he
[1:23:35] wasn't satisfied until he went through
[1:23:37] his whole congregation and they all got
[1:23:39] born again well see then when you take
[1:23:41] communion every you don't do this you
[1:23:43] don't you know you're sitting there
[1:23:44] taking communion sit there taking
[1:23:46] communion and you kind of go see if
[1:23:49] brother Dick's taking
[1:23:51] it see if F one's taking I see some of
[1:23:54] y'all do
[1:23:56] that what have they done
[1:23:59] yeah that's not brotherly kindness you
[1:24:03] better worry about
[1:24:04] you
[1:24:06] right and you know if a if a if a a
[1:24:09] stranger comes in and takes communion
[1:24:12] what are you going to do it's open
[1:24:13] communion you don't know what that
[1:24:15] person's done or or what right exactly
[1:24:18] it's your choice to take it I'm just
[1:24:20] telling you that if you take it though
[1:24:22] and you live a like brother Claud said
[1:24:23] you take it and you live a hound dog
[1:24:25] life you going to get what a hound dog
[1:24:27] gets sometimes he gets shot and run over
[1:24:30] that's what he says so just realize that
[1:24:32] it's it's a it's a sacred thing it's
[1:24:35] just for the Believers right there was
[1:24:37] no unbelievers in that Upper Room when
[1:24:39] 120 received the Holy Ghost they were in
[1:24:42] communion one with the other 120 people
[1:24:45] that's why brother Brown said if the
[1:24:47] Church of Ephesus was a powerful Church
[1:24:49] all 12 people were born again yeah and
[1:24:52] they were they had these virtues working
[1:24:54] in their life give me a church like that
[1:24:57] I don't need 500 or 300 or 100 give me
[1:25:01] 12 people that will believe the word of
[1:25:04] God live it be it I I'll take that any
[1:25:07] day L we okay you love the Lord before
[1:25:10] we take communion let's pray I want to
[1:25:12] pray we'll pray for us and then we'll
[1:25:13] take uh take communion let's bow our
[1:25:16] heads Heavenly Father we pray Lord that

[1:25:21] to you Lord
[1:25:22] that we've said it from the bottom of
[1:25:24] our heart that we believe that if we
[1:25:26] don't live these virtues that we're
[1:25:28] we're living way below our
[1:25:30] Privileges and Lord we want to project
[1:25:33] that virtue and knowledge Temperance
[1:25:35] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:25:37] project it to the people so that they'll
[1:25:39] see it and they'll see Christ Living in
[1:25:41] a human being cuz the only part of you
[1:25:44] that the Earth's going to ever see Lord
[1:25:47] on this side of
[1:25:48] judgment is us the people walk walking
[1:25:52] through the streets of Satan's Eden the
[1:25:55] worst most Dark Hour ever on the face of
