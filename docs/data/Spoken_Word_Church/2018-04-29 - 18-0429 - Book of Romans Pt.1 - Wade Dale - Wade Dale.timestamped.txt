[0:00] all right what I asked what would never
[0:01] start taking online reservations dollar
[0:08] charge if you come in today this is
[0:09] where you see it what if they don't come
[0:11] then they get charged but they get
[0:13] charged still get final no Magnum seats
[0:22] we used to sitting down hollyhocks good
[0:27] well brother I'm not in it last yeah
[0:35] yeah they're horrible the other horrible
[0:38] they're not good we're long I know
[0:40] that's why shouldn't say it was we're
[0:44] getting to be back in the house a little
[0:46] more good to be back in the saddle we
[0:50] are we are going to by the guidance of
[0:53] the Lord we're going to start through
[0:55] the book of Romans
[0:56] so just Bible study we might bring in
[0:59] someone what the prophets in I apologize
[1:02] that my hook her up her thing don't hook
[1:05] her up to menu iPad that Anderson and
[1:09] then bought me but Richards on the phone
[1:11] now ordered me an adapter so we'll have
[1:14] it on the screen next thing and we will
[1:17] be able to look at some of these words
[1:18] out because I want to look I've been
[1:19] looking through the Bible and looking at
[1:24] the commentaries of what other people
[1:26] wrote which is fine you can do that and
[1:29] we may bring in some other translations
[1:33] or really not interpretations but you
[1:36] know read a little bit more where we can
[1:39] understand it but the book of Romans is
[1:42] a issue the longest book to Paul wrote
[1:46] so he really spent a long time writing
[1:48] because I'm gonna give you a little
[1:50] history because the Roman it makes you
[1:52] understand see I understood better what
[1:55] I was reading even when I was I would go
[1:58] to I think it's a Bible talk or the guy
[2:01] has a real good eye he he doesn't give
[2:03] any doctrine he just gives you what Paul
[2:05] did where he was that when he did it cuz
[2:08] really
[2:08] Paul had never been to Rome when he
[2:10] wrote for the Romans he was incorrect he
[2:13] within contrast when he wrote this
[2:14] letter mmm so he had not made it to Rome
[2:17] yet but he knew there was people in Rome
[2:19] that was Christians so he was talking to
[2:23] him and he was getting ready to go wrong
[2:24] now so he's never been there before so
[2:28] he's talking to these people that are in
[2:29] Rome from Corinthians so you're going to
[2:32] see a little bit of Corrections mixed in
[2:36] because remember Corinthians is one book
[2:38] of Correction the Corinthians were I
[2:41] mean let's just be plain we had a guy
[2:44] sleeping with his mother-in-law and with
[2:45] his stepmom and we're not sleeping but
[2:48] got married and they all kind of messed
[2:50] up stuff from Paul gothic and even in
[2:52] Corinthians that he were original couple
[2:54] of Sundays Oh liars
[2:56] you know transgressors and all that he
[2:59] had a big list he's successful some of
[3:00] you well he had a minute congregation so
[3:03] what he done was is he least sent us a
[3:07] message what he done he is is he took
[3:11] and wrote these letters to the Romans
[3:14] and send them to him before he come so
[3:17] this guy will have a good commentary
[3:18] because I want you to look at go to you
[3:21] Bible women now if you've got a Scofield
[3:22] Bible you can read this footnote but
[3:24] that's okay we won't do it today but
[3:26] it's real strange that the Lord brought
[3:29] us into the book of Romans because the
[3:31] book of Romans is in three parts chapter
[3:35] one through chapter middle chapter 5
[3:38] Paul is speaking of justification it
[3:42] ties in pretty good with what we're
[3:43] doing upstairs in chapter 5 12 through
[3:48] chapter 8 39 deals with sanctification
[3:52] and then 9 through 11 deals with the
[3:56] children of Israel are then being reborn
[3:59] really the book of Romans now as we read
[4:03] this book of Romans remember what Paul
[4:05] did Paul went to the Old Testament and
[4:09] got the revelation to write all of his
[4:12] books
[4:14] one of the commentators said this is the
[4:16] way it was positioned because it's not
[4:19] the first epistle
[4:21] it's about the fourth or fifth or maybe
[4:24] even six but it's in the order in the
[4:27] Bible right after the book of Acts is
[4:29] the first book so right after the book
[4:31] of Acts here comes the book of Romans so
[4:34] the book of Romans is an exposition of
[4:36] the Old Testament so Paul what he's
[4:38] doing is he's cooking the old taking the
[4:39] Old Testament brought it in and in his
[4:42] letters because remember these are the
[4:45] physical letters that Paul writes to
[4:47] people okay he wrote letters like
[4:50] putting the mailings into but once they
[4:53] picked it up and read it the inspiration
[4:56] of God said that's going into the Bible
[4:59] that's how all this come come to being
[5:01] is is they were letters written palm
[5:04] down right next to me and you but it's
[5:06] absolutely the Eternal Word of God so it
[5:08] is does alright but that book of Romans
[5:11] is a total exposition of the Old
[5:13] Testament so as we go through this you
[5:15] need to keep this in your mind because
[5:16] what helps me more than anything
[5:20] I never liked somebody to tell me well
[5:25] this is just the way it is I can't stand
[5:29] that so I left home I don't like
[5:40] somebody said this is the way it is well
[5:42] what well I should I know
[5:45] there's something behind this so that's
[5:48] the same way with the book of Romans
[5:49] their book aramas yes the Bible yeah but
[5:52] there's something behind this book that
[5:55] we by the inspiration of the Lord should
[5:57] understand not just well this is Romans
[5:59] 1 remember because remember there was no
[6:01] chapters right God had the scribes into
[6:07] whatever 14th century or whenever it was
[6:09] had them put these chapters because you
[6:12] watch Paul Paul takes a thought and he
[6:14] continues right on and you would think
[6:16] hey we don't need footage after - it's
[6:18] just a continuation because that Larry
[6:20] never had chapter it was a full rhythm
[6:23] and this was the longest letter that
[6:25] Paul wrote of
[6:26] gospel says you're in way over here
[6:29] Romans like 16 so this is the longest
[6:32] book he wrote the longest letter that he
[6:35] wrote to the people and it's just it's a
[6:38] wonderful book I'm glad they put it
[6:40] right after the book of Acts though the
[6:42] Holy Ghost fell now you see the book of
[6:44] Romans were where Paul has taken the Old
[6:47] Testament and bringing it into the new
[6:49] he did that same thing with the book of
[6:52] Hebrews but I want us to understand now
[6:54] as we recall what he is writing remember
[6:58] the Holy Ghost wrote this one Paul but
[7:02] that was Paul Paul wrote it in Polish
[7:05] and that he it begins here at Paul a
[7:07] servant of Jesus Christ called to be an
[7:10] apostle separated unto the gospel of God
[7:13] so he knew he was a separated person
[7:15] he's telling you he wrote this but he's
[7:18] writing this to you and I and the
[7:21] generation that's one level about the
[7:23] Word of God you know it doesn't matter
[7:24] the the world continues on 10 more years
[7:27] 20 more years this is still going to be
[7:30] coming to that generation of people so
[7:33] to me that that's to me that's the onion
[7:35] peel the layers that you just keep
[7:37] pulling a little thin layers back and
[7:39] you can see into the Word of God so
[7:41] let's read this now and go verse by
[7:44] verse and like I said not you so much
[7:47] let's look at this to apply to our life
[7:50] when we get into the book of Hebrews
[7:52] brother branham's mentioned Romans a
[7:55] good bit but he really you know remember
[7:57] he he went into the chapter of Hebrews
[7:59] and did a series on so we'll use a
[8:02] little of that but I want us to see it I
[8:04] want us to be able to see these things
[8:05] okay
[8:06] I want us to be able to know why God
[8:09] wrote the book of Romans to me and you
[8:11] not to the Romans not to call but to me
[8:19] because I always go back to that quote
[8:21] brother Brown says faced final resting
[8:24] places in the Word of God if you can't
[8:27] take it back and look at it in the Bible
[8:30] because remember even blessing Martin
[8:35] Luther
[8:36] Martin Luther love the book Romans if
[8:39] you'll read his writings I read them a
[8:41] little bit last night or yesterday the
[8:43] book of Romans Martin Luther loved the
[8:46] book of Romans and you're going to find
[8:47] that why because the just shall live by
[8:50] faith Paul uses several times in this in
[8:53] this chapter so Martin Luther really
[8:56] loved the book of Romans and I haven't
[8:58] read his commentary yet but he does have
[8:59] a commentary on the book of Romans and
[9:01] I'm gonna read it and just show that you
[9:04] know this is not just you got to look at
[9:09] the Bible and that's why I'm with the
[9:11] seals that become a brand-new book
[9:12] because you look at the Bible and you
[9:15] look on the surface and you see God's
[9:18] talking to you but now God's not talking
[9:20] to you just in baby form justification
[9:22] he has got a higher form of
[9:24] justification and then I like what
[9:25] brother Ernie says a true revelation of
[9:29] justification that's for the part of you
[9:32] that didn't do it that's where
[9:33] everybody's the problem with the people
[9:35] is it's remember brother Brown said you
[9:38] can't misplace the word of God okay
[9:42] can't-miss place you put it in its wrong
[9:45] place so what people are doing now even
[9:47] in the message oh I always was eternal
[9:49] that come with this eternal seat just
[9:51] wait a minute that will be revealed to
[9:53] you later but you can't take away I was
[9:56] thinking yesterday I worked in the bee
[9:59] yard from like 9 o'clock to 8 o'clock
[10:01] last night
[10:02] and had a lot of time thing but you
[10:05] can't take you take this like the book
[10:09] of Romans and you look at it and you
[10:13] read it but remember Martin Luther rated
[10:17] - he read it with Martin Luther's
[10:19] revelation right wet John Wesley
[10:25] obviously read the book of Romans in the
[10:27] sanctification party is but now as we
[10:30] have the sales opened up we see a true
[10:34] revelation and justification I always
[10:36] want eternal I was I was in the mind of
[10:40] God actually I was this
[10:43] okay then I became the word made flesh
[10:47] when I got born again
[10:49] I was made flesh from mom and daddy
[10:53] human flesh carne like the president was
[10:55] saying the other night meat that's in in
[10:58] Spanish carne is made and that's what he
[11:00] was saying she would just mean that this
[11:01] is all this is in meat right
[11:04] alright but that one from the eternal
[11:06] was in the Word of God you were in the
[11:07] Word of God listen God had Paul write
[11:10] this because you were gonna be here God
[11:15] had Matthew right there so you could be
[11:17] in there John forgot so loved the world
[11:20] he gave me only begotten Son who never
[11:21] believed in him shall not perish but
[11:23] have eternal life and that was written
[11:24] for everybody this born again they put
[11:27] their name in that one scripture I think
[11:29] okay so that's the way we're going to
[11:31] read this book of Romans I want you to
[11:34] read it and and remember one thing
[11:37] that's what I think that's what I can't
[11:39] get about these people you cuz you you
[11:42] remember what you used to do yes right
[11:48] we remember the things we used to do
[11:49] they work darling right so I can't take
[11:54] away salvation you gotta leave salvation
[11:56] where it is this whole book is a book of
[11:59] redemption which redemption I was
[12:01] thinking last night Redemption means
[12:05] something that lost you did something
[12:11] got lost you got lost so you were in a
[12:14] lost condition yes right now because you
[12:20] were in the mind of God you could be
[12:22] reading that's the clover the ground
[12:24] only you know only the ones that are
[12:26] born again are even thought of in
[12:29] Redemption because redemption to me is
[12:32] is what we're standing here now heading
[12:34] toward to change the body that's full
[12:36] redemption in the Bible I'm sure you got
[12:38] baby for redemption where people were
[12:39] renamed they come to just
[12:41] vacation they died they waked a thousand
[12:43] years they come up with the judgment and
[12:45] they have to be judged by the words and
[12:47] they believed on the Lord Jesus Christ
[12:49] and thou shalt be saved
[12:50] alright alright but they see that's not
[12:53] good enough for us right we know better
[12:55] more light has my brother they'll say
[12:58] more like that bug that eat that thing
[13:00] down has been exposed we know who that
[13:02] bug is right but that life in them roots
[13:07] come up and then you and I earn we come
[13:10] to Wesley come through Luca Luca Wesley
[13:13] penticoff now here where the word is
[13:16] that that same one that was put in the
[13:18] ground is right at the end of the stalk
[13:19] now this is us worth not to shock
[13:23] we're that seed that's inside there all
[13:26] right so that's what we come to we can't
[13:28] look back and say we're to shoot right
[13:30] now we came from to shoot okay when I
[13:34] got born again I started as to shoes
[13:35] because I want to just do justification
[13:37] sanctification baptism all to go and
[13:39] then the quick you come to life because
[13:41] the life's in the sea the life's not a
[13:43] stock anymore it life's not enough you
[13:46] watch corn you take corn watch it grow
[13:48] gets real grain but when the ears come
[13:50] out stop dies first
[13:52] all right then all of a sudden the seed
[13:54] drives up and then you can plant it you
[13:56] don't plant stop stop dead don't plan to
[14:00] leave leave your bed the seeds once got
[14:02] laughing so that life came up through
[14:04] there went out into the lamb down to
[14:06] that acorn or whatever you want to call
[14:08] it and the lobster night corn it's not
[14:10] even Leon's not in the tree for that
[14:13] acorn you understand one always dies so
[14:17] that's what we're at now we're not we're
[14:19] not doing away you can't just you can't
[14:22] just all of a sudden won't carry I'm
[14:24] turn and see a an ear of corn laying on
[14:28] the ground he just popped up by the
[14:30] ground no it's got to come through two
[14:32] shoes then the stock in the tassel
[14:36] within the corn all right
[14:38] you don't just walk up there and plant
[14:39] one city you can walk out there and you
[14:40] start seeing here's the corn later on
[14:42] the ground
[14:42] no I think to live but anyway it's same
[14:45] way with the Word of God
[14:47] it doesn't start where you just get
[14:49] everything dump don't get one done yes
[14:51] man right
[14:52] it comes in layers it comes in layers
[14:55] but you know what you got to believe
[14:57] every layer this way yes I mean I've
[15:01] said before you know we are believing
[15:03] something that we don't know happen
[15:05] that's right
[15:06] did you know Jesus died do you know he
[15:09] rose do you know I mean did you go
[15:12] physically witness that no you have to
[15:15] have faith that that's what happened and
[15:16] that's why I'm telling you that because
[15:17] you got to read Romans and have faith
[15:19] causes health faith faith faith faith
[15:22] one coach technically Paul didn't see
[15:26] Jesus die
[15:28] thank Lee never saw Jesus raised from
[15:30] the day right he had to meet God it's
[15:36] like I said before I I want to ask these
[15:38] people that says that you know we have
[15:40] these eternal seed in us Paul couldn't
[15:43] be persecuted see if he will see at that
[15:46] time a man
[15:48] okay Brian persecute Brian Christians
[15:50] can't persecute Christians and he calls
[15:52] him to blaspheme and it's written in the
[15:54] word so we don't have to we don't have
[15:56] to get a well maybe he said no he wrote
[15:58] that he did he calls him the black thing
[16:01] he held a code of the Pharisees when
[16:04] Stephen was stoned amen well Paul had a
[16:07] purpose
[16:08] Paul had a seed of representation but
[16:10] that Holy Ghost wasn't inside of him
[16:12] right and I want to ask these people to
[16:15] well I'm going while I'm on my soapbox
[16:17] there I'm going to I want to know where
[16:23] if you always was and you just come to
[16:25] this realization
[16:26] what about justification what about
[16:28] sanctification what does the Holy Ghost
[16:30] do well I want to understand because
[16:32] brother I'll always give the three steps
[16:36] so see I'm just going to be ignorant
[16:39] enough to that okay
[16:41] then they're preaching eager to that and
[16:44] come back to this I know that Paul
[16:47] preached justification sanctification
[16:48] baptism Peter preached jessica's
[16:51] if each person preached justice that can
[16:54] hold up so as long as we stay their name
[16:56] brother Brown like said on future home
[16:58] back to the Single Double
[16:59] he said I talked to three processes the
[17:02] grace I don't see reading fit three
[17:03] processes grace in if you just woke up
[17:05] one day and see it's just like I said
[17:07] about the what they were saying is is
[17:09] one day you just woke up out in the
[17:10] field and you worry record laying on the
[17:12] ground no tissue stopped I sold corn to
[17:16] shoot it's like Daddy said that's
[17:19] thinking
[17:20] when he said that doesn't matter who's
[17:25] on this earth at this moment right today
[17:28] doesn't matter rich poor young old
[17:31] doesn't matter we all were birth the
[17:34] same way naturally naturally we all were
[17:38] birth the same way we came from an act
[17:41] from a mama and a daddy you know the
[17:44] rest of the story so there's no
[17:46] difference in us as human beings so
[17:49] that's the same way with a new birth
[17:51] when you get the new birth it's got to
[17:53] be the same evening it's gotta be the
[17:56] same sure you may have a reaction me
[17:57] most I'm talking about though you gotta
[17:59] go to justification sanctification burn
[18:01] out that old nature and put god's nature
[18:04] in now to me that fits the bible from
[18:08] like the old man says from keyword akira
[18:10] right and even the killer is holy all
[18:14] right that's what he said you know it's
[18:16] right I just I I just won't if you'll go
[18:19] through that though cuz you know what
[18:21] happens you watch this because we're
[18:23] gonna see it in Romans you watch the hey
[18:24] Teddy and how minded people that said I
[18:27] always was he turning they jumped way
[18:29] over here they are they leave the
[18:32] message they going to fall sir dog more
[18:35] false doctrine they have affairs
[18:38] there's a lot of things happen to these
[18:40] people that preach this I was this great
[18:43] seed when I was born my baby you know I
[18:47] didn't need all this other stuff but if
[18:50] you'll stay right here and simple
[18:53] justification sanctification about
[18:55] didn't hold of you will
[18:57] you know why because God can't go
[19:01] against his word that's right so if he
[19:02] does you can stand there and call him a
[19:04] liar the thing but see they came they
[19:07] can do that because they're gonna
[19:09] realize one day - hey I should went to
[19:11] justification okay right but if we go
[19:15] through those three processes you cannot
[19:17] go wrong so Paul right here after the
[19:19] book of Acts with the Holy Ghost falling
[19:21] on the day of Pentecost through the book
[19:24] of Acts here's Paul working all right
[19:26] you got that Paul's working even in -
[19:30] it's since 1862 but the book of Romans
[19:33] had written in 86 T so he rode it during
[19:36] the commentary of the book of Acts
[19:38] because the Holy Ghost fell when the
[19:40] Holy Ghost fell the Holy Ghost fell Paul
[19:43] didn't say Lord who art thou but wait a
[19:50] minute I've always been he come no he
[19:53] said throughout our Lord he said I'm
[19:55] Jesus who you persecuted this was in
[19:57] them Christian people and Paul had to go
[19:59] find somebody that had the Holy Ghost
[20:01] right don't lay hands on him you get to
[20:03] hold a gun man I just want to I want to
[20:06] I just don't understand I want to stay
[20:08] with the simplicity of the extreme works
[20:10] of grace even we see them in the higher
[20:12] form of the seals that is still the same
[20:16] justified freely and then I show the
[20:20] rider of the Apostles Paul we got to get
[20:22] this commentator then we're gonna read
[20:24] just a few a few verses that alright I
[20:26] want you to pray that God speak to you
[20:29] through these through the scripture yes
[20:32] I I want to change my thought process
[20:37] here I told you that if I ever let's put
[20:41] somewhere in and couldn't get anything
[20:43] one book I always said it would be the
[20:45] future home right I disagree give me the
[20:48] Bible give me the bottle
[20:52] give me the Bob I know that's that's
[20:55] good but giving about collisions word of
[20:57] God from giver to hear it and I can sit
[21:00] and read it and we ought to be able to
[21:02] preach and not say brother Brown said
[21:05] because you know what he has is though
[21:08] what he brought was is a knowledge let
[21:11] me put it this way he brought a perfect
[21:14] understanding of the Bible so we don't
[21:17] question right what's going on
[21:20] like other commentators we we God spoke
[21:23] through him to us God spoke directly
[21:27] through him just like a four inch
[21:30] conduit pipe just click on the inside
[21:32] buddy come right into brother Robert
[21:33] right out his mouth and it fell on a
[21:35] bunch of believers but now what we got
[21:37] to do is we can't be Mockingbird that's
[21:40] right we can't be monkey murdered well I
[21:43] heard a preacher one time telling me he
[21:45] was brought he was a Mockingbird for
[21:47] brother around I said okay buddy and by
[21:49] the way he preached that's pretty much
[21:50] exactly correct would you die get it for
[21:54] you style parody yes okay yes it is
[22:07] parrot parrot yeah I can't do it nope
[22:10] he gives you a voice he give you
[22:12] understanding no we had to listen to the
[22:14] voice no doubt but God is gonna always
[22:17] speak to you through the work now if we
[22:20] have a question in the word he sent us a
[22:22] prophet to bring it and line it by her
[22:25] so that's what he did with Paul Paul
[22:28] went to the Old Testament remember you
[22:31] got to look at them and I'm just gonna
[22:33] give you a basis for this you got to
[22:35] remember put yourself I like to put
[22:37] myself in the day that these people
[22:39] wrote this because you got to remember
[22:43] same way with brother Branham when he
[22:45] first started his ministry he had bad
[22:47] it's Methodist Pentecostal terian he has
[22:51] a just class scope of denomination
[22:56] sitting and he had to preach to each one
[23:00] of them so I said one time listen stand
[23:03] up and address the third personal
[23:04] Trinity we what addressing his third
[23:05] person he was addressing their third
[23:07] person right right he couldn't be saying
[23:10] let's address the third person of the
[23:12] Trinity and him never been friends very
[23:13] never in his life right so he was
[23:16] preaching to them just like Paul I
[23:19] watched a movie about Paul's long time
[23:21] ago and they did a real good job but I
[23:25] want to watch this new one and see if he
[23:27] does the same thing but Paul remember he
[23:30] was a Jew but he was a scholar and he
[23:32] knew how to handle people when he went
[23:35] in and walked in the car around he
[23:37] didn't have a baseball back and start
[23:39] knocking their idols down the movie
[23:43] shows Paul walking into into the city of
[23:45] Corinth and they've got their idols and
[23:47] well Paul starts playing with the kids
[23:50] he's on the playground the kids her plan
[23:52] he's playing he plays a little rock
[23:54] games and he started doing that then he
[23:56] starts talking to the Perry a lot better
[23:59] you can get you can get more out of
[24:01] honey you know you catch more honey than
[24:03] you can with with vinegar so he walks in
[24:06] and he gets comfortable because remember
[24:08] the Corinthian people they were Idol
[24:10] worshipers they were whoremongers they
[24:11] did what they wanted to do so Paul
[24:14] didn't come in and start knocking stuff
[24:16] over he started playing with kids and
[24:18] you see him you know he'd sit down talk
[24:20] to the parents you know for the kind of
[24:21] ease his way in same way where the
[24:23] Romans could remember when we start
[24:25] reading this you got to remember the
[24:26] book of Romans where is the seat of
[24:29] Satan you shall know what's in the end
[24:33] time well it started back there so Paul
[24:37] is going into a group of people that
[24:41] still is living under the Old Testament
[24:44] yeah Old Testament Scrolls they live by
[24:46] that Torah they live by the prophets
[24:48] they live by this now he sees a
[24:51] conversion because remember the book of
[24:55] Acts started on what 80 30 there the
[24:57] Pentecost
[24:58] so for 60 years now you got a discount
[25:03] Paul persecuted
[25:05] persecuting the people for one thing for
[25:07] several years he persecuted the
[25:08] Christians then he became a convert so
[25:12] you got eighty sixty when he wrote this
[25:13] he's like 30 years in them in his walk
[25:17] with God so he's but he still looking at
[25:22] these Jews because he's going to cover
[25:23] circumcision uncircumcision he's gonna
[25:26] cover clean idols and you know he's
[25:29] gonna cover all day he's gonna cover the
[25:31] Holy of Holies he's gonna cover the
[25:33] sacrifices so once he covers that you
[25:35] got to remember you said well we don't
[25:37] do that anymore you know we got idols
[25:39] and all that stuff please please we just
[25:40] don't have them
[25:41] please don't have them like they have
[25:43] them when they send them up pray to them
[25:44] no no we have all of our different items
[25:47] that we help they take up our time
[25:48] because an idol worshiper something to
[25:50] worship and an item it's set before you
[25:54] know that's why we have to have faith in
[25:56] something we don't sing we got to have
[26:00] faith right most people and you'll see I
[26:04] think maybe in Paul in Romans or Hebrews
[26:06] he talks about things not made from the
[26:09] earth and right and all that stuff so
[26:12] let's just read a few verses here tackle
[26:17] one so Paul is speaking now from car ant
[26:22] to the Romans and remember this is going
[26:25] to be sectioned off from Romans one that
[26:30] we're going to read now into Romans five
[26:32] so maybe you can read Romans one through
[26:35] five that is speaking of justification
[26:39] and even you can pick it up in your
[26:41] Schofield Schofield even over on rent
[26:43] Romans 5:12 speaks of sanctification so
[26:49] we'll get into that and I like to read
[26:51] the other commentaries I don't like to
[26:52] just you know take one program did he
[26:57] read all kinds of
[26:58] of commentaries from different people
[27:01] but see if I have a question I know I
[27:03] don't go to DOM sooner but nothing
[27:07] against those men but I don't go to them
[27:09] because they're not vindicated to me I
[27:11] didn't say the one vindicated there not
[27:13] been kid to me the property guard
[27:15] indicated to me so I go back to and
[27:17] listen to what he said and what he said
[27:19] you still gotta run through your filter
[27:22] goes remember he's speaking to worldwide
[27:25] group but now remember see God starts
[27:28] whittling this away that's why in 1963
[27:30] he says I call you bride he starts
[27:32] talking to the bride he don't talk to
[27:34] the denomination so he said he saw that
[27:36] they were doing even though he preached
[27:40] to me even though he went to a man had
[27:42] all kind of brotherly love
[27:43] he'd go preach them people and knowing
[27:44] that hated him but just because game or
[27:47] are or whatever that other guy's name is
[27:50] the Christian businessmen guy they hated
[27:53] brother Ram ulis and many people tell
[27:55] you they didn't like him but because of
[27:56] car wheels
[27:57] just because brother Williams having
[27:59] someone's influence he'd get brother
[28:01] brown man to preach them glass who he's
[28:03] preaching to them 300 preachers in
[28:05] Chicago it was a men sterile Association
[28:07] through the Christian businessmen he
[28:09] spoke to him and 300 of them didn't
[28:11] believe a word he say it right right cuz
[28:14] it ain't the Lord said they're gonna
[28:16] challenge you on that you know right so
[28:18] so what'd you win anyway same way were
[28:20] Paul Paul you'll see Paul get stoned
[28:24] never lay him down for them all the way
[28:27] uh a bigger kind of ledge to get out of
[28:30] a city one time right cuz one you know
[28:33] he was going against their religion so
[28:37] all right chapter 1 Paul a servant of
[28:41] Jesus Christ
[28:42] so he's positioning himself alright
[28:45] called to be an apostle that's my
[28:48] question are you called you called to do
[28:50] something alright
[28:52] I know many a call if you're chosen but
[28:55] if you have a calling you need to use
[28:57] that call it because Paul's using theirs
[28:59] right what separated unto the gospel of
[29:02] God now remember the gospel had been
[29:05] robbed yet they went a stitch a Bible
[29:10] written in 80/60
[29:11] he was riding this way look was riding
[29:14] it yes they were riding it at the moment
[29:17] so the gospel of God wasn't a written
[29:20] piece of parchment the gospel was power
[29:23] demonstration of the Holy Ghost through
[29:25] people right
[29:27] I mean people pay attention you have a
[29:32] Internet to go back own or go back
[29:34] listen could you cliff do half of the
[29:36] service you know you know they've got
[29:38] what they got sitting there listening to
[29:42] a preacher and you know I don't think
[29:44] they had tablets or anything new they
[29:46] have to remember coming was a power God
[29:49] in salvation they knew had changed them
[29:51] alright now I want you to watch this now
[29:55] let's watch this one thing brother
[29:57] they'll brought this down a long time
[29:59] ago look at this watch Paul's writing
[30:02] it's a word called interpolate or
[30:05] interpolating interpolating
[30:08] interpolating is not that his
[30:10] interpreting what he's doing is every
[30:12] time you see parentheses look to chapter
[30:14] verse 2 what he's doing is is he makes a
[30:17] statement Paul makes a statement then
[30:22] he's going to not interpret what he said
[30:24] but he's going to add a little more so
[30:27] you can understand what did you say
[30:30] their way okay with that everything you
[30:33] look in parentheses what happened there
[30:35] is Paul is writing watch Paul's sermon
[30:37] let me read it like it should be oh well
[30:40] let me read it like without the princi
[30:42] excuse me Paul sermon Jesus Christ
[30:44] called to be an apostle separate into
[30:46] the gospel of God concerning his son
[30:47] Jesus Christ our Lord which was made the
[30:49] seed of David see you can miss something
[30:51] right there the interpolates in verse 2
[30:54] see the parentheses yes what now let's
[30:59] really like said Paul a servant of Jesus
[31:00] Christ called to be an apostle separated
[31:02] of the gospel of God that's a comma
[31:05] now he's going to tell you why he just
[31:07] said what he did which he had promised
[31:11] afore by his prophets in the Holy
[31:13] Scripture goes back to the Old Testament
[31:16] got that so the gospel of God he's
[31:20] talking about sure it's the gospel is
[31:23] preached
[31:23] but Paul saying my foundation is what
[31:26] the apostles and prophets spoke that's
[31:29] why he's interpolating he's telling you
[31:30] it's not just the gospel of God it's the
[31:34] gospel of God which he had promised
[31:36] afore by his prophets and that is
[31:40] because Scofield Bible that by his
[31:42] interpreted it's true
[31:43] which he had promised a form through his
[31:46] prophets in the Holy Scripture
[31:49] all right so that's the Old Testament of
[31:51] the Holy Scripture were even was not
[31:52] written at that time all right
[31:54] see there's a comma that sees you see
[31:57] that commas not period so he didn't
[31:59] finish the thought he's continuing the
[32:00] thought and you watch Paul we'll go
[32:02] through here in a minute he might go for
[32:05] verses and it being princely but what he
[32:08] did when he done what he's telling you
[32:10] he's explaining why he said what he said
[32:13] and it makes it more plain to us you
[32:17] know what I believe I believe Paul's
[32:18] writing this and God said you better say
[32:20] this right here to get the people to
[32:24] understand better you better save this
[32:25] right here okay all right Paul sorry
[32:29] Jesus Christ called me an apostle
[32:30] separated unto the gospel of gun which
[32:33] he had promised afore by his prophets in
[32:34] the Holy Scripture all right concerning
[32:37] his son Jesus Christ now that's the
[32:40] whole Old Testaments full of Jesus
[32:42] Christ
[32:43] the prophets are telling us that Jesus
[32:45] Christ is coming right yes which was
[32:48] made of the seed of David according to
[32:50] the flesh now remember he had no fleshly
[32:54] part but when God was in the Old
[32:57] Testament he had to deal with flesh
[32:59] right the Bible that come he couldn't
[33:03] get into the soul of man he dealt
[33:05] through the flesh of man you got it
[33:08] slice when he's saying he said
[33:10] concerning his son Jesus Christ our Lord
[33:12] which was made of the seed of David
[33:15] according to the flesh but when he told
[33:16] David under inspiration by the prophets
[33:18] he said David in other words this is
[33:22] going to come from your lineage because
[33:24] I really love you David so I'm gonna
[33:27] have a son when Solomon at the time but
[33:31] you see you gotta have your hairdo
[33:33] meaning right his son was Solomon and
[33:36] a very good job until the very end of
[33:38] his life right right let's see that's
[33:42] why I didn't you people don't ask them I
[33:45] see if someone would add Holy Ghost in
[33:47] his soul he'd never let two women turn
[33:50] him into idolatry right David wouldn't
[33:53] him Uriah killed for Bathsheba you see
[33:55] what I'm saying something
[33:56] there's the flesh part in the Old
[33:58] Testament you got to keep that look if
[34:01] God couldn't give an assault turn the
[34:02] man right cause the blood of bulls and
[34:05] goats covered what he did yes sure they
[34:07] were justified they were they weren't
[34:09] you know God didn't see it which was
[34:12] made of the seed of David according to
[34:14] the flesh
[34:15] now that is from David not to Solomon
[34:21] but from David's rust because he said
[34:25] David you'll always have this one on the
[34:28] front so it had to be a natural vintage
[34:31] and you can read in Luke wait is it Luke
[34:34] and Matthew I believe look at the
[34:37] landing it brings it right down to the
[34:41] cry Jesus Christ they're minutes okay
[34:42] but remember ahead stop at Joseph in the
[34:47] reality farm because Joseph had no see I
[34:50] mean Jesus had no single Joseph okay but
[34:54] according to the flesh think now look
[34:56] here we are again we may not ever get
[34:58] through this chapter but that's okay you
[35:00] look at Paul Paul is speaking to a group
[35:03] of people and he's telling them look the
[35:06] Old Testament was a fleshly thing does
[35:09] he don't the law now what he's gonna do
[35:12] you watch him in Romans though a little
[35:14] bit further down he starts bringing them
[35:16] through the law brings them right back
[35:18] out to grace see Paul II just start
[35:21] blessed on this is where it is and
[35:22] you're gonna have to bleep know he's
[35:24] he's I know you don't know the old text
[35:27] unless what he's saying to this group of
[35:28] people I know you don't know the Old
[35:30] Testament right right okay and the Old
[35:34] Testament was a fleshly lineage but now
[35:37] I'm fixing to later on and I'm gonna
[35:39] give you will read it north one cuz what
[35:41] just right here for four he's according
[35:44] to the flesh you got all this coming
[35:46] down to Jesus
[35:46] now Paul knows for a no shadow of a
[35:50] doubt that Jesus was not born Joseph are
[35:53] no human lineage it's a problem Paul
[35:58] knows Jesus was virgin born God produced
[36:01] a chemist and this journal right but he
[36:04] says right here he's talking to that
[36:06] group of people said look now according
[36:07] to the flesh David's going to have a
[36:09] sign that'll be on the throne because
[36:11] remember Christ didn't come here to sit
[36:14] on the throne of David when he was here
[36:16] in flesh
[36:17] that's promised in the morning so it's
[36:21] not here promised him the Millennium
[36:23] it's real sit on the throne of David
[36:25] ruling to 12 from there's a gap of
[36:27] Gentile dispensation that Christ didn't
[36:30] come here to settle them from physically
[36:32] right right right he never wanted to he
[36:38] would touch flesh but he wanted to get
[36:40] inside there people come he said when I
[36:43] leave and I come back I'm coming in you
[36:45] know I'm gonna be with you but I'm gonna
[36:46] be in here I'm gonna be around you don't
[36:48] know be in here all right so that was
[36:51] the part that calms look looking for
[36:54] here watch verse 4 and declared to be
[36:57] the Son of God with power according to
[37:02] the spirit of holiness what by his
[37:05] resurrection all right so now he's took
[37:09] you from the outside to the inside
[37:10] because if the Flex didn't resurrect
[37:13] yourself hey is that all right the flesh
[37:16] of Jesus laid in that tomb for two days
[37:20] dead cold getting ready to corrupt
[37:26] didn't crush get ready to correct dead
[37:28] cells were dead organs were dead brain
[37:31] was dead so there had to be something
[37:35] because what Paul's saying he says all
[37:38] right now all you in the Old Testament
[37:39] your sacrifices they died but you never
[37:42] saw him come back they didn't kill the
[37:45] lamb in the next day the lamb was back
[37:46] alive again no they were dead but now
[37:49] right here by the resurrect
[37:52] from the dead right there buddy he
[37:53] sparked it to a group of people that
[37:55] it's not these sacrifices sure there's a
[37:59] fleshly lineage but you got to get away
[38:01] from that and come back to the lineage
[38:03] of that man that resurrected because
[38:06] like I said Jesus is flesh body never
[38:08] resurrected itself in itself I don't
[38:12] have of something the quickening power
[38:14] of the prophets say the quickening power
[38:15] what the same quicken afire you got you
[38:18] call what we're in Romans he's going to
[38:20] say the same spirit that raised up Jesus
[38:21] from the dead erase and quicken your
[38:23] mortal body so he's going to continue
[38:26] installing all right with this one more
[38:29] scripture Newell I don't want I want us
[38:31] to get done pretty quick here
[38:33] all right concerning his son Jesus
[38:35] Christ our Lord which was made of the
[38:38] seed of David according to the flesh and
[38:40] declared to be the Son of God with power
[38:43] according to the spirit of holiness by
[38:46] the resurrection from the dead by whom
[38:49] we have received Grace know what the
[38:52] wedding dress in the Old Testament yes
[38:54] there was but according to the people
[38:56] that saw it there was no grace do you
[38:58] either put this blame on that and when
[39:00] that lamb died you got forgiven and this
[39:02] lamb here and that Turtledove and you
[39:04] don't say one thing yes now watch here
[39:05] by whom we have received Grace and
[39:08] Apostleship for obedience to the faith
[39:11] among all nations what for his name
[39:14] Jesus Christ
[39:15] all right among whom are ye also now he
[39:20] said he was called up in verse 1 yes
[39:23] called to be an apostle yes separated
[39:25] there are all Paul you got to be here
[39:27] no listen to a sermon among whom are you
[39:30] eat also the call of Jesus Christ all
[39:35] right do all that here in Rome beloved
[39:37] of God called to be Saints grace to you
[39:40] and peace from God our Father and the
[39:41] Lord Jesus Christ now we're gonna take
[39:44] that word and and put even and you'll
[39:46] understand anyone
[39:47] Terry that grace be unto you peace from
[39:51] God our Father even the Lord Jesus
[39:52] Christ first I thank my God through
[39:55] Jesus Christ for you all that your faith
[39:58] is spoken of throughout the whole world
[40:00] will stop right there in the heat
[40:01] there was a faith that the Romans had
[40:03] that no way outs had now that's kind of
[40:05] hard to believe cuz they're sitting over
[40:06] there in Rome but youth they had to have
[40:09] more faith because listen I was thinking
[40:11] last night look at the Roman Empire I
[40:16] mean they conquered the world and they
[40:18] weren't nice people right they came up
[40:21] with all this crucifixion and all these
[40:23] things of torture came from Rome the
[40:26] Romans so they're sitting in Rome being
[40:30] Christians and living the life kind of
[40:33] like the fourth church age were those
[40:36] Christians were living in the dark ages
[40:39] right giving their life for the gospel
[40:42] and here was Rome again took over but
[40:45] she agreed in the Bible on the for
[40:46] church age where they you know I in
[40:48] other words I'm not forgot you
[40:50] you got to enough faith to get through
[40:52] so that's why said the Bible now even
[40:54] reading the book of Romans I'm fat all
[40:56] first single second sealed third seal
[40:58] for Kiko okay so that's what I want you
