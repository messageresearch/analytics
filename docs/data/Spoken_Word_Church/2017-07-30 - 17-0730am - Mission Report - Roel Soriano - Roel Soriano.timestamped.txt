[6:07] amen we don't want to see a man this
[6:11] morning
[6:12] you want a same mr. brick you each and
[6:19] every one of you of lesson morning in
[6:22] the name of the Lord Jesus I greet you
[6:25] from my church in tight tie the
[6:28] Philippines which we call the Church of
[6:30] the overcomer and I am very thankful
[6:33] that the Lord has given me this
[6:36] opportunity to be able to minister again
[6:38] to this congregation I'm really thankful
[6:42] for the connection that he has made you
[6:45] know between our church my ministry and
[6:47] this ministry in Lula Georgia I want you
[6:54] to know that this church has been
[6:56] helping me in our missionary endeavors
[7:01] in the Philippines and I think before I
[7:06] go to the preaching of the word I just
[7:09] wish to share reduce some things that
[7:12] are taking place in our country as far
[7:14] as outreach is concerned you can be
[7:18] seated for just a little while before
[7:30] coming over here month before coming
[7:34] over here we made a trip to some ballast
[7:41] it's about four hours north of Manila
[7:45] and from a town called botolan we had to
[7:56] rent a we call it they call it the
[8:00] weapon carrier it's a war vehicle
[8:02] because because nothing else can make it
[8:09] to the road conditions as you can see in
[8:13] the presentation
[8:18] 12 some 12 years ago I baptized a
[8:24] tribesman along with the 70 other
[8:30] Negritos we call him and they belong to
[8:33] the eight tribes the itit rides and they
[8:38] look like little applicants you know
[8:41] only smaller the same skin same
[8:45] appearance curly hair good and they're
[8:48] like our aubergines the Filipino
[8:52] aubergines and so I baptized this
[8:58] brother along with the others and then
[9:01] because of I was so busy you know with
[9:04] outreach and with ministry I did not
[9:08] actually do any Paulo op work on these
[9:10] people Mississippi it's kind of hard to
[9:12] go to where they are but last month out
[9:19] of the blue this brother showed up in my
[9:22] church with three workers and I found
[9:27] out that he had become a minister a
[9:29] pastor from a Korean sponsored church
[9:33] something like a Presbyterian Church the
[9:37] planet if I'm not mistaken but the the
[9:40] things that we heard 12 years ago when
[9:44] we presented a message to them he said I
[9:47] helped them in my heart I've treasured
[9:49] the words in my heart you know and the
[9:52] matter what I heard from this other of
[9:54] denominational preachers and theologians
[9:57] that that taught us in the ministry
[10:01] I took a hold of what I heard twelve
[10:05] years ago because I believe it was a
[10:08] truth and they came to my church one
[10:12] thing to know more and so they stayed
[10:14] there for about for about a week and I
[10:19] taught them more more of the word more
[10:21] where the Prophet said and so this
[10:28] brother has been praying for a
[10:31] Church that can be started in their old
[10:35] community back in 1991 among kena to bow
[10:40] erupted and it's supposed to be the
[10:42] second biggest eruption in this century
[10:45] and when it erupted there was we were
[10:50] four hours away in Manila but there was
[10:53] about an inch of ice for in our roof
[10:57] so that's how how outspread the
[11:06] explosion and and asphalt reached as far
[11:09] as Indonesia in Malaysia and so these
[11:14] people these people used to live at the
[11:17] foot of the volcano and they will
[11:20] deflect this place because of the
[11:22] eruption and the government tried to
[11:25] resettle them and gave them about 50
[11:29] square meters about 500 square foot of
[11:32] property for family and they they find
[11:36] it hard to survive on that because the
[11:39] mountain people they live on the land
[11:41] they hunt and they farm and they just
[11:45] couldn't survive on a little plot like
[11:47] that so after about 20 years they went
[11:52] back to where the eruption took place
[11:55] you know right at the foot of the
[11:56] volcano and started planning and to
[12:00] their surprise the the soil became very
[12:03] fair tile that the the plants the the
[12:09] trees and the things that they planted
[12:13] actually grew rapidly which made them
[12:16] decide to go back to this community and
[12:19] right now there's 200 families that have
[12:24] come back and are resettling in this
[12:27] community and this brother but appalled
[12:31] the leader I found out that he's one of
[12:34] the elder elder of the community is
[12:39] highly respected amongst these 200
[12:42] families and
[12:45] is said he if you don't mind I would
[12:48] like to invite you to come to our place
[12:51] to that to that community so you can see
[12:55] the situation and because I believe
[12:58] there's a possibility that we can build
[13:00] a church there and kiss the people a
[13:02] message let's see some of those slides
[13:08] here this is this is about a pole right
[13:13] here
[13:14] what's second to the left so he was the
[13:19] one that brought the other minister to
[13:22] train in our church hmm next slide
[13:27] please
[13:28] and so this was the night before we were
[13:31] planning our the launch for us to go to
[13:36] go to that community and talk to the
[13:38] people there and maybe hold a service
[13:41] and present Jesus Christ to the people
[13:43] next this was a type of vehicle that the
[13:49] can can travel the area there's there's
[13:54] no other vehicle they can do it so we
[13:56] had to rent this daco for about maybe
[13:59] $200 for the whole day so we can use it
[14:04] for the whole day next and we carried
[14:11] some supplies to bring to those people
[14:14] because they they have nothing over
[14:16] there next as you can see it was raining
[14:21] and these are brothers from our church
[14:24] in in in Thai tag that helped me out
[14:27] there's about a dozen of them that came
[14:29] with me next
[14:33] either way they were soaked soaking wet
[14:36] because of the rain next day that's the
[14:43] and then it's the Sun started to shine
[14:48] now they're bearing the heat of the Sun
[14:50] after the rain next now this is one of
[14:56] the houses that has been built there
[14:59] always
[14:59] there's probably about two dozen houses
[15:03] like this in the area because they were
[15:06] given them something like to a KERS for
[15:10] family at the foot of the mountain you
[15:15] can see the amount in a two bow on the
[15:19] background right there you know the
[15:23] houses are made of grass you know that's
[15:27] roof next and this was a spot that they
[15:33] donated to us so we can build a church
[15:35] right there so this is the very first
[15:38] church that will be built in this new
[15:40] community praise the Lord for that yes
[15:43] hallelujah next and these are demand
[15:50] these are the leaders of this community
[15:54] called baboon sea lemon baboon solanum
[15:58] is in English it means the place of the
[16:02] new birth thanks now this one is a woman
[16:10] preacher no but she gladly received us
[16:14] and puts up to cooperate when we build a
[16:18] church there you know we were sharing
[16:21] the message to her and so far she has
[16:23] accepted everything that she heard face
[16:27] alone next these are the newly settled 8
[16:33] of villagers 200 of them by the end of
[16:37] the year they expect a thousand families
[16:39] to move in though it got next and that's
[16:45] another house few houses has been
[16:50] erected in the village next these are
[16:57] the eighth of children that have to walk
[17:00] two hours to school the nearest school
[17:04] is two hours away next another one of
[17:10] the houses
[17:12] see these they don't have floors that's
[17:16] just a sand floor the whole thing is
[17:19] like a sand field we call it to the
[17:21] heart field that's the mud flow coming
[17:24] from the volcano next as you can see no
[17:31] other vehicle can go through like if you
[17:35] miss the if you miss the once a day trip
[17:38] of the weapon carrier you have to take
[17:40] this the the water buffalo cart to take
[17:49] about eight hours to cover the area next
[17:53] or this is the common just a common mode
[18:02] of transportation in the provinces we
[18:05] call it the sky lab that's the whole
[18:09] family in one scooter next or this this
[18:17] is a three-wheeled vehicle it is very
[18:20] common in a country next as you can see
[18:26] this is a deserted place there's nothing
[18:29] in it no supplies no stores no schools
[18:34] no medical clinics no doctors whatsoever
[18:38] you know they live a tough life over
[18:42] here next now this was where the this
[18:51] building was where the sisters cooked
[18:53] food for 200 families that attended the
[18:56] evangelistic service it's a beautiful
[19:01] place as you can see thanks now they
[19:06] have to carry this steel ramp to keep
[19:11] the truck to keep our trap from stalling
[19:13] in the sandal hartfield we had to cross
[19:17] the river a dozen times to reach our
[19:19] destination next
[19:24] as the beautiful mount up in to book
[19:28] next and these are then agreed Negrito
[19:33] villagers intently listening to the
[19:37] Gospel as it's being preached so the
[19:41] Lord has supernaturally opened the door
[19:44] to this community so we can build a
[19:47] church over there when I go back we will
[19:49] start digging a well and building a
[19:52] church because there's no problem
[19:53] building concrete blocks in the area
[19:56] there's a lot of sand from the volcano
[19:59] so we just have to supply them a cement
[20:03] and some iron and galvanized sheet for
[20:07] roofing and I believe we can start a
[20:10] good sized Church there in this
[20:12] community so you just remember us in
[20:14] your prayer Aladin
[20:26] okay we now go to the message proper and
[20:35] my message is taken from attacks in
[20:41] Zechariah chapter 4 verse 1 to 10 thank
[20:48] you for standing up in respect to the
[20:51] Word of God I entitle this message the
[20:57] might and power of Zerubbabel the might
[21:01] and power of Zerubbabel and the subtitle
[21:06] is the coming of the headstone Zechariah
[21:11] chapter 4 verse 1 to 10 and the angel
[21:15] that talked with me
[21:16] came again and waked me as a man that is
[21:23] wakened out of his sleep and said unto
[21:27] me what see us thou and I said I have
[21:31] looked and behold a candlestick of all
[21:34] gold with a bowl upon the top of it and
[21:38] his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes
[21:42] to the seven lamps which are upon the
[21:45] top there off and to all the trees by it
[21:49] one upon the right side of the bowl and
[21:52] other upon the left side there off and
[21:56] so I answered and spake to the angel
[21:58] that talked with me saying what are
[22:06] these you see Zechariah could not
[22:08] understand the vision so he was asking
[22:12] the angel what was this my lord and then
[22:16] the angel that talked with me answered
[22:18] and said unto me knowest thou not was
[22:21] this me and I said no my lord and then
[22:26] he answered and spake unto me saying
[22:28] this is the word of the Lord and to
[22:31] zerubabbel saying not by might nor by
[22:36] power but by my spirit saith the Lord of
[22:39] hosts
[22:40] who art thou or great mountain before
[22:44] zerubabbel thou shalt become a plane and
[22:48] he shall bring forth the headstone there
[22:51] off with shouting saying grace grace
[22:54] unto it let us pray
[22:57] how many father we thank you again for
[22:59] this blessed opportunity to be able to
[23:02] talk about your word and to serve your
[23:08] people and be an encouragement to them I
[23:10] pray father that you send your anointing
[23:13] right now and cost me to say something
[23:16] that would really encourage the people
[23:18] and cause them to go on Lord as we
[23:22] strive Lord to which that state of
[23:26] perfection that you are requiring in the
[23:28] church just be with us Lord we present
[23:33] all the needs to you as we are a needy
[23:35] people this morning we just believe that
[23:38] you're able to reach out to meet each
[23:42] and every one of them we thank you and
[23:46] praise you in the name of Jesus Christ
[23:48] we pray I mean be be seated now sakurai
[23:57] administered during the time when Israel
[24:02] went back to Judah after being held
[24:08] captive for seventy years plus we all
[24:11] know they were held captive for seventy
[24:13] years in Babylon and of course Nehemiah
[24:24] built the city but there was a need to
[24:29] restore the temple and Zerubbabel was
[24:36] commissioned to build a temple of the
[24:40] Lord because it was completely
[24:44] demolished by the Babylonians and the
[24:51] Israelites being
[24:54] godly nation wanted to having been
[24:58] resettled in Judah they wanted to
[25:00] rebuild the temple and so the local
[25:11] residents of Judah after they left you
[25:15] know when they were still in Babylon huh
[25:18] they wanted to help out you can read
[25:21] this in Zechariah chapter 3 they wanted
[25:25] to help build the temple they wanted
[25:28] they were proposing a ecumenical
[25:31] construction project
[25:34] you know the religions coming together
[25:36] and helped build the temple again
[25:39] because it was once a significant temple
[25:42] fame was the whole world the Jewish
[25:45] temple that Solomon built but you see
[25:49] they refused not because of pride but
[25:54] because they didn't want people that
[25:59] built temples and altars for pagan gods
[26:03] to be helping in the construction in the
[26:06] temple they wanted to be built by true
[26:09] believers they they didn't want any
[26:13] denominational hand in it and but then
[26:19] the people pestered them and used their
[26:22] political influence and wrote to the
[26:25] king and warned the king that these
[26:28] people are they once of rebelled against
[26:33] the kingdom and they were telling the
[26:37] king that they told the king in their
[26:40] letter that should the temple be rebuilt
[26:44] that they would certainly be in
[26:46] resurrection in insurrection again these
[26:49] people are rebels and so and and it and
[26:53] it discouraged the people somewhat
[26:57] discouraged the people and after our
[27:00] building the foundation of the temple
[27:04] fifteen years passed
[27:07] and nothing was done to build the temple
[27:10] and it was laying there desolate just
[27:14] the foundation and because the people
[27:19] with discouraged and they actually
[27:22] deserted the project and started
[27:25] building their own houses
[27:50] use me
[28:04] and you could resist in the book of
[28:07] Haggai chapter one huh
[28:11] I think verses 3 and 4 down to the tenth
[28:17] verse let me just read it for you
[28:21] then came the word of the Lord by haggai
[28:24] the prophet saying it is time for you to
[28:27] dwell in your sealed houses or houses
[28:31] with feeling paneled houses and this
[28:36] house lies in waste I mean the Prophet
[28:42] Haggai was preaching to the people of
[28:44] Israel because they pursuit the building
[28:46] of the temple and started building their
[28:48] nice houses hallelujah
[28:51] now therefore thus saith the Lord of
[28:55] hosts consider your ways you have so
[28:58] much and bringing little heat but you
[29:03] have enough you have not enough you
[29:06] drink but you have not killed the drink
[29:09] you clothe but there is not there is
[29:12] none warm and he that earn it we just
[29:15] earned it wages to put it into bag with
[29:18] holes this thus said the Lord of hosts
[29:23] consider your ways go up to the mountain
[29:26] and bring wood and build this house and
[29:30] I will take pleasure in it and I will be
[29:33] glorified said the Lord you look for
[29:36] marks and lo it came too little and when
[29:40] you brought it home I did blow upon it
[29:43] why said the Lord because my my house
[29:46] lay in waste
[29:48] I mean pasture high pasture hey guy was
[29:55] upset with the people because you know
[30:01] the people say why would I give to the
[30:03] Lord why would I give to the church why
[30:06] would I contribute to the build
[30:09] construction of the church when I have a
[30:12] lot of meats myself I have many bills to
[30:16] pay
[30:17] not realizing that the need of God to be
[30:22] worshipped is more important than any of
[30:25] your needs hey guys there that's the
[30:30] reason God is not blessing you because
[30:34] you're putting your needs first before
[30:39] the need of the Lord to be worshipped
[30:41] we have many needs but I believe I
[30:45] believe first and foremost
[30:49] God's need to be worshipped should be
[30:53] met speak first the kingdom of God and
[30:57] His righteousness and all these things
[31:00] that you can think of that you need ah
[31:03] hallelujah can ever think of will be
[31:05] added and to you hallelujah
[31:10] I believe that you know my heart now
[31:14] when Zechariah was shown this vision of
[31:18] the seven golden candle stick you know
[31:22] it's no different from the seven golden
[31:24] candle stick of Revelation chapter one
[31:27] verse 12 that was shown to John you see
[31:32] the it's a lamp stand and for a lamp
[31:42] stand to burn and be able to give light
[31:45] or shine the light it needs oil
[31:51] and Zechariah was being shown that on
[31:56] both side of the lamps and stand order
[31:59] candlestick of course we know that the
[32:03] candlestick represent the church ages
[32:05] it's the church hallelujah well in order
[32:10] for the church to give light it has to
[32:12] have oil and we see here the second ayah
[32:17] saw the the two olive oil or olive tree
[32:21] it's like a direct supply sustaining the
[32:27] supply of oil to the
[32:31] standby huh are you listening this is if
[32:35] this is God supplying the Holy Spirit to
[32:40] the church hallelujah because without
[32:43] the Holy Spirit the lamp scent will
[32:46] never burn the peep the world will never
[32:50] see the light of God the light of the
[32:53] world without the oil so who the only
[32:59] the only priest represent the steady
[33:05] supply and I believe that's what we need
[33:10] a steady supply of oil amen not just a
[33:15] deep at a time you know when you're down
[33:20] when you're feeling down and you need to
[33:23] be revived you're asking for oil you're
[33:25] asking for God to give you a revival no
[33:29] we need a sustaining source we need the
[33:34] the Holy Spirit of God every single
[33:37] moment of our life hallelujah hallelujah
[33:41] now people say that the two olive lived
[33:47] all the trees were Zechariah and Haggai
[33:52] because they were the two prophets that
[33:55] minister during this period of time
[33:57] encouraging the people preaching to the
[34:00] people to come and work together to be
[34:03] able to restore the temple of the Lord
[34:07] and start worshipping God in Jerusalem
[34:09] again in spite of the situation of the
[34:15] in spite of the problems that were
[34:17] facing it was very very turbulent times
[34:20] that they were facing but Zechariah and
[34:23] Haggai they were very faithful in
[34:25] teaching the word to them encouraging
[34:27] them so some theologians think that the
[34:31] two olive trees were Haggai and
[34:35] Zechariah but then again some preachers
[34:40] think that these are not Haggai and
[34:43] Zechariah
[34:45] but these are zerubabbel
[34:49] and Joshua the high priest and
[34:54] Zerubbabel was assigned as the governor
[34:57] of Judah at that time he was over the
[35:00] people and he was the ruler of the
[35:02] people and he took the initiative to
[35:07] lead the people in building the are
[35:10] building the Temple of the Lord
[35:13] hallelujah and so they're saying it must
[35:17] be saruba Bell and Joshua now we'll go
[35:22] back to this a little bit but it wasn't
[35:25] those not Haggai and and zechariah 'not
[35:31] zerubabbel
[35:32] and joshua we read in the book of
[35:37] revelations chapter 11 the true
[35:42] interpretation let me just find it here
[35:55] yeah revelation revelation verse 11
[35:59] chapter 11 verse 3 and 4 I think that
[36:04] that's the fourth slide ok
[36:14] the Bible says and I will give power
[36:16] unto my two witnesses we all know that
[36:20] this is Moses and Elijah right the two
[36:23] witnesses and they shall prophesy a
[36:25] thousand two hundred and threescore days
[36:28] three and half years clothed in
[36:31] sackcloth and and we read next these are
[36:39] the two only trees and the two
[36:42] candlesticks standing before God the god
[36:46] of the earth hallelujah
[36:49] so the theologians got it wrong the
[36:53] Bible is always right you don't have to
[36:57] interpret God's Word God has a way of
[37:01] interpreting his own word hallelujah in
[37:07] Zechariah chapter four verse eight to
[37:09] ten he can go back to the slags brother
[37:13] I think and it's in the fifth slide
[37:27] Zechariah chapter chapter four verse
[37:33] eight to ten moreover the word of the
[37:37] Lord came unto me saying the hands of
[37:39] Zerubbabel laid the foundation of this
[37:41] house and his hand shall also finish it
[37:45] and thou shalt know that the Lord of
[37:48] Hosts has sent me unto you and who has
[37:53] despised the day of small things for
[37:56] they shall rejoice and see the plummet
[37:58] in the hands of just arewho in tho with
[38:01] those seven and they are the eyes of the
[38:04] Lord which one to and fro through the
[38:08] whole earth now here with the zerubabbel
[38:12] holding the plummet in his hand you know
[38:16] of the chief engineer or the chief
[38:19] builder holds the plummet because the
[38:23] plummet is the what you call that in our
[38:26] present language
[38:28] is a plumb bob it's a plumb bob it keep
[38:32] it keeps things straight hallelujah it
[38:36] keeps the other structures structural
[38:40] members in its right place hallelujah so
[38:43] we see that the river bill was the main
[38:45] man he was commissioned to lay the
[38:49] foundation and he laid the foundation
[38:52] and for 15 years nothing happened and
[38:55] then Haggai encouraged the people if he
[39:00] will just immense step in faith
[39:04] that's when Zechariah was given the
[39:07] vision of the golden candlestick and
[39:11] Zechariah asked the question what does
[39:14] this mean it's not by might nor by power
[39:20] don't you look for the people who would
[39:22] like to cooperate don't you look for
[39:25] number and the might of the people
[39:28] hallelujah don't you look to King
[39:30] Diaries or King Silas or our tech senses
[39:33] to give you the authority in order to
[39:36] finish this temple it's not by might nor
[39:39] by power of any man it's by my spirit
[39:43] says the Lord hallelujah the temple of
[39:47] the Lord will be built because of the
[39:51] power of God hallelujah because of the
[39:54] power of the Holy Ghost did not the
[39:58] Bible say unless the Lord builds the
[40:01] house its builders is the laborers build
[40:07] it in vain hallelujah let's look at the
[40:16] words of Haggai chapter 1 verse 4 to 8
[40:27] and then came the word of the Lord
[40:30] by haggai the prophet saying it is time
[40:34] for you oh yay to dwell in your sealed
[40:38] house and this his house lying in a way
[40:42] this was a guy trying to encourage the
[40:44] people I think we're ready already ready
[40:46] now therefore does said the Lord of
[40:49] Hosts consider your ways you have so
[40:51] much and bring little heat but you
[40:53] cannot you have not enough you drink but
[40:56] you have not filled your drink you have
[40:58] coated but there's no warm and then you
[41:01] have you earn it rages and ernit wages
[41:04] but put him into a bag with whole
[41:07] hallelujah thus said the Lord God of
[41:10] hosts consider your ways go up to the
[41:13] mountains and bring wood in other words
[41:15] help contribute to the building of the
[41:20] temple isn't that what God is doing
[41:23] today I believe the Sega Raya was shown
[41:28] not the building of the second Zechariah
[41:34] was shown the building of the Church of
[41:38] Christ he was shown the completion of
[41:43] the Bride of Christ hallelujah he was
[41:46] shown our day hallelujah thank you Jesus
[42:04] now in Revelation chapter one verse
[42:06] eight see the foundation has been laid
[42:11] and it says here I am the Alpha and the
[42:17] Omega the beginning and the ending said
[42:21] the Lord which is and which was and
[42:24] which is to come the Almighty the Jesus
[42:29] is saying I am the beginning and I am
[42:31] the ending
[42:32] I am the foundation and I am the
[42:36] headstone
[42:37] I am the capstone in first Queen can
[42:41] shelter three verse 11 it says for our
[42:43] foundation can no man lay than that
[42:47] which is laid which is the Lord Jesus
[42:50] Christ the foundation of the church is
[42:53] the Lord Jesus Christ efficient chapter
[42:58] 4 verse 15 says but speaking the truth
[43:00] in love that we may grow up unto him
[43:03] into all things which is the head even
[43:06] Christ Christian growth is geared
[43:11] towards reaching the stature of Christ
[43:14] the stature of a perfect man there's no
[43:17] perfect minimalist there's only one
[43:19] perfect man and that's Christ hallelujah
[43:23] so he's the head is the headstone he's
[43:26] the capstone is the foundation and is
[43:30] the capstone hallelujah Haggai chapter 2
[43:36] verse 23
[43:37] on that day it says the Lord of Hosts I
[43:39] will take use the rouble son of CF VL my
[43:43] servant and wear you like a signet ring
[43:47] for it is you whom I have chosen this is
[43:52] the word of the Lord
[43:54] now the Rubel has been chosen of the
[43:58] Lord huh as a signet ring and a seal in
[44:03] the Hebrew translation the signet ring
[44:06] and the seal mean the same thing
[44:09] hallelujah because the King he wears a
[44:14] ring and with it he steals all
[44:18] documents all the orders that come from
[44:20] him and once it is sealed it becomes
[44:23] official hallelujah huh
[44:26] so the Robo Bell was the one well I was
[44:32] thinking maybe because silver Bell is in
[44:36] the Linga in in lineage of David King
[44:39] David hallelujah
[44:41] but you see I have a different way of
[44:44] looking at it the word silver Bell
[44:47] actually means one that is born in Babel
[44:53] one that is born in Babylon confusion
[44:58] weren't we all but there was another
[45:04] another man that was constantly with
[45:08] Zerubbabel as they were building the
[45:11] temple and that man was Joshua the high
[45:17] priest
[45:20] komai this is wonderful Joshua and
[45:24] Zerubbabel and Bevin said Joshua means
[45:30] Jehovah and the name Jesus actually
[45:36] means Jehovah is Savior hallelujah
[45:41] the rubber Bell could not do it alone he
[45:46] needed Joshua
[45:49] hallelujah that's why if you read the
[45:52] book of Zechariah in the book of Haggai
[45:54] it's sometimes confusing because
[45:58] sometimes it looks like saruba velak
[46:03] being called the branch but other times
[46:09] Joshua it's being called the branch now
[46:14] wish you switch hallelujah I I believe
[46:18] there's a reason for it
[46:23] let's talk about the branch the branch
[46:26] is an Old Testament term that refers to
[46:28] the Messiah
[46:30] in Isaiah chapter 4 verse 2 it says in
[46:35] that day shall the branch of the Lord be
[46:38] beautiful and glorious and the fruit of
[46:42] the earth shall be excellent and comely
[46:45] for them that are escaped of Israel
[46:48] talking about the coming Messiah the
[46:50] Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah
[46:53] but here in Zechariah chapter 6 we read
[46:57] who that the angel was instructing
[47:04] Zechariah to take silver and gold and
[47:07] make crowns and set them upon the head
[47:10] of Joshua not survivable but Joshua the
[47:15] high priest the son of josedech the high
[47:17] priest and speak unto him saying that
[47:20] speak speak at the Lord of Hosts say
[47:23] behold the man whose name is the branch
[47:25] oh my I thought serum Abell was the
[47:29] branch but now here Joshua is called the
[47:34] branch and he shall grow up unto this
[47:37] place and he shall build the temple of
[47:40] the Lord even he shall build a temple of
[47:43] the Lord and he shall bear the glory and
[47:45] shall sit and rule upon his throne and
[47:48] he shall be a priest upon his throne and
[47:51] the counsel of peace shall be between
[47:54] them both my two persons are involved
[48:00] here in building the temple who are they
[48:04] the revival and Joshua the riverboats
[48:08] called the banks Joshua is called the
[48:11] branch Oh - a mystery here hallelujah
[48:17] now I believe just what represents Jesus
[48:22] the Holy Ghost and the rubyville
[48:25] represents the bride born in Babylon
[48:34] where did we all come from we came from
[48:37] confusion
[48:39] but we were called by this message into
[48:42] this blessed truth hallelujah and what
[48:47] is God doing God is building another
[48:49] temple this time it's a spiritual temple
[48:54] not a physical temple we read in the
[48:58] Bible where the glory of the second
[49:01] temple was glorious more glorious than
[49:04] the first but if you look at it
[49:07] historically you know the pomp and the
[49:14] greatness and the beauty of the second
[49:18] temple that was built was nothing in
[49:21] comparison to the first temple it was so
[49:25] small it was so simple compared to the
[49:28] first temple but why did the Bible say
[49:32] the glory of the second temple was more
[49:35] the second house was more glorious than
[49:37] the first you know why because the son
[49:42] of man Jesus Christ came came to that
[49:46] second temple not the first but the
[49:50] second temple God manifested in the
[49:52] flesh and he came in preached at that
[49:55] second temple hallelujah despised more
[49:58] glorious than the first oh my hallelujah
[50:06] thank you Lord Jesus
[50:13] Matthew chapter 21 verse 42 to 44 jesus
[50:18] said unto them did you never read in the
[50:21] scriptures the stone which the builders
[50:24] rejected the same is become the head of
[50:28] the corner this is the Lord's doing it
[50:33] it's not by might nor by power but by
[50:38] the spirit saith the Lord this is the
[50:40] Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our
[50:44] eyes therefore say I unto you the
[50:47] kingdom of God shall be taken from you
[50:49] and given to a nation bringing forth the
[50:54] fruits thereof are we the nation and
[50:59] whosoever shall fall on this stone shall
[51:01] be broken but whomsoever it shall fall
[51:04] will be will be ground to powder we are
[51:08] the nation of God hallelujah not the
[51:11] denomination but God is building a
[51:16] nation hallelujah amen
[51:20] Zechariah chapter 3 verse 8 we read here
[51:25] now o Joshua the high priest thou and
[51:29] thy fellows that sit before thee for
[51:32] they are men wonder that for behold I
[51:36] will bring forth my servant the branch
[51:39] for behold a stone that I have laid
[51:41] before Joshua upon one stone shall seven
[51:45] eyes shall be seven eyes from the hope
[51:48] behold I will engrave the graving
[51:50] thereof said the Lord of hosts
[51:52] and I will remove the iniquity of that
[51:55] land in one day in that day said the
[51:58] Lord of hosts ye shall shall every man
[52:01] be his neighbour under the vine and
[52:04] under the fig tree the fig tree has
[52:07] always been Israel meaning God is
[52:11] setting up chapter setting up a kingdom
[52:13] a worldwide Kingdom and every nation on
[52:17] earth will be sitting under under this
[52:19] fig tree alleluia but when said in 6
[52:25] fold purpose of Gabriel
[52:27] visit Daniel and there shall come forth
[52:31] a rod out of the stem of Jesse a branch
[52:38] that shall grow out of his roots and
[52:42] bedroom said who was that
[52:44] Christ even the branch is Christ there's
[52:49] no question about it out of his roots in
[52:56] adoption number four better than said
[53:00] this the whole heaven is named Jesus the
[53:05] whole church is named Jesus
[53:07] everything is named Jesus for it's the
[53:11] only name that God ever had
[53:15] he's called Jehovah Jehovah Jireh these
[53:19] are titles the Lord's provided sacrifice
[53:23] Jehovah Rapha the Lord that he'll be
[53:26] Jehovah the lord's banner Yoba manassas
[53:30] and Jehovah different Jehovah's he's
[53:33] called the Morningstar
[53:34] is called the father is the son is
[53:37] called the Holy Ghost is called the
[53:38] Alpha is called the Omega and he's
[53:41] called the beginning and is called the
[53:42] ending and then he is called the branch
[53:45] oh my oh
[53:49] he's called all kinds of titles but he
[53:51] only have one name and that's the Lord
[53:55] Jesus Christ and then he said it again
[53:59] planting the vine and were two planet
[54:01] the life of Christ is the branch the
[54:06] branch is not Branham Tabernacle I'd
[54:10] like to say it again the branch is not
[54:14] Branham Tabernacle branch is not William
[54:19] Branham the branch is whosoever will be
[54:24] plucked up out of your unbelief and
[54:26] planted and to him
[54:30] I thought he said it was Christ but
[54:38] there's a change here the branch is
[54:40] whosoever will be plucked out of your
[54:43] unbelief and planted into him
[54:48] he's talking about thee he's talking
[54:52] about you talking about the rubber Bell
[54:57] one that has been born in Babylon
[55:00] hallelujah but has been set free because
[55:04] of the word of truth that they've heard
[55:07] hallelujah
[55:08] not by might nor by power but by the
[55:13] holy spirit says the Lord oh my
[55:19] Joba jar everyone said this now to touch
[55:24] me it wouldn't make any difference
[55:28] I'm a man but to touch him then he's the
[55:34] Holy Spirit that's in there then he
[55:38] reacts back and uses human lips because
[55:43] he is divine we are the branches he does
[55:50] he doesn't bear fruit he only energizes
[55:56] the branch of Omaha I like that he is
[56:02] the vine we are the branches and the
[56:04] bank don't bear fruit
[56:06] it's the branches that bear fruit but
[56:12] where do we get the power the energy to
[56:15] be able to bear fruit from the source
[56:20] from the olive tree the main supplier of
[56:25] oil hallelujah that's Christ but if Adam
[56:32] expounded on Zechariah chapter 3 verse 8
[56:35] and 9 we read it a while ago but let's
[56:37] see how what Berman says about it in the
[56:42] message the beach between the seven
[56:45] churches ages and the seals he quoted
[56:49] Zechariah chapter three verse 8 and 9
[56:52] first he said here now all Joshua the
[56:56] high priest thou and thy fellows that
[56:58] sit with thee for they are men wonder
[57:01] dad for behold I will bring forth my
[57:04] servant the branch and then vermin said
[57:07] Christ for behold the stone that I will
[57:11] lay before Joshua upon stone one stone
[57:15] shall be seven eyes and seven eyes
[57:18] behold I will engrave the graving 's
[57:21] there on set the Lord of Hosts I will
[57:24] remove the iniquity of the land in one
[57:27] day Zechariah was saying on this
[57:32] foundational stone are seven eyes and
[57:36] then better bana said this the seven
[57:38] eyes he said I Smith see seeing means
[57:45] prophets seers this land had seven horns
[57:51] and on its horn had an i7 eyes what is
[57:58] it are you ready everyone said Christ
[58:03] and his bride hallelujah this is Christ
[58:08] and his bride I'm talking about Christ
[58:12] alone but Christ and his bride this is
[58:15] not just do the ruble alone is Jerusalem
[58:18] and Joshua together they're called the
[58:23] branch
[58:24] oh my don't you love him Christ and his
[58:30] bride he said seven Church ages out of
[58:36] there was seven prophets that went forth
[58:39] seven seers eyes so the last one must be
[58:45] a seer
[58:46] I believe that Bill Omaha bourbon not on
[58:50] the puppet two times as I said a seer
[58:55] hallelujah
[58:56] you see William Branham connects the rap
[59:00] foundation to the Lamb of God Revelation
[59:04] chapter 5 verse 6 it says and I beheld
[59:07] and lo in the midst of the tone and out
[59:11] of the four beasts and in the midst of
[59:13] the elders stood a lamb as it has been
[59:18] slain having what seven horns and seven
[59:22] eyes which are the seven spirits of God
[59:27] sent forth into all the earth from man
[59:32] hallelujah seven spirits but really is
[59:36] not saying that God is seven spirits
[59:39] hallelujah but these are seven portions
[59:43] of one Holy Spirit sent forth in every
[59:48] Church age into all the world hallelujah
[59:52] praise God in this church age we have
[59:57] all seven measures in this church age we
[1:00:03] have the fullness Alleluia
[1:00:07] so you see the connection now huh now
[1:00:12] let's talk about the vine and the
[1:00:13] branches the message investment but
[1:00:17] urban service the world is one thing to
[1:00:20] see Christ Jesus said I am the vine ye
[1:00:25] are the branches and the branch bears
[1:00:29] record of the vine because it draws his
[1:00:31] energy in life from the vine well the
[1:00:35] first time the first bands that came
[1:00:38] from this vine they wrote a book of Acts
[1:00:41] behind advance we see the way the Holy
[1:00:45] Spirit acted in that first church and
[1:00:48] that church of Pentecost and and when he
[1:00:52] when we believe that it's the original
[1:00:54] vine if the original vine ever puts
[1:00:57] forth another branch they will write
[1:01:00] another book of Acts behind it because
[1:01:03] it's the same life that is in the vine
[1:01:07] now you read the book of Acts again and
[1:01:10] it's see if there's an ending to it
[1:01:13] there's no definite ending to the book
[1:01:15] of Acts why because it is being written
[1:01:19] again hallelujah John 15 verse 5 I am
[1:01:31] the vine ye are the branches he that
[1:01:34] abideth in me and I in him the same
[1:01:36] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[1:01:40] you can do nothing you can build your
[1:01:47] spiritual life however you want to but
[1:01:51] jesus said without me you can do nothing
[1:01:55] we talked about this the three stages of
[1:01:58] grace the three steps of grace
[1:02:02] justification sanctification baptisms
[1:02:05] only goes and then we went into adoption
[1:02:07] but if you think of it without Christ
[1:02:11] you can never be justified without the
[1:02:16] power of the Holy Ghost you can never be
[1:02:19] sanctified without the power of the Holy
[1:02:23] Ghost you can never receive the baptism
[1:02:25] of the Holy Spirit without me you can do
[1:02:30] nothing
[1:02:34] revelations 1:20 the mystery of the
[1:02:36] Seven Stars which thou sawest in my
[1:02:38] right hand and the Seven golden
[1:02:40] candlesticks the seven stars are the
[1:02:42] angels of the seven churches Ages or the
[1:02:46] seven churches and the seven
[1:02:48] candlesticks which thou sawest are the
[1:02:50] seven
[1:02:53] so we now understand the vision that was
[1:02:57] shown Sakurai amen
[1:03:01] without oil the lampstand can never give
[1:03:05] forth light without me the Lord said you
[1:03:10] can do nothing you know all pastors they
[1:03:14] want to do the best that they can to you
[1:03:19] know pitch the word and straighten the
[1:03:22] lives of the people hallelujah but in
[1:03:26] reality without God we could do nothing
[1:03:29] it's God that does the job hallelujah
[1:03:33] he's the Builder of the house the
[1:03:37] uniting the uniting time and sign that
[1:03:42] sound good but what have they done the
[1:03:47] Builder of the house was in there in a
[1:03:51] form of a lowly Galilean carpenter and
[1:03:55] they turned him down when God had
[1:03:59] vindicated him of being his messenger of
[1:04:01] the hour the branch he said and they
[1:04:05] turned him down they turned the branch
[1:04:09] down hallelujah and how he'll we be
[1:04:16] known God has provided a lamb I'm
[1:04:19] quoting this and how he will how will he
[1:04:22] be known how will we know him by his
[1:04:29] nature of adversary what he does his
[1:04:33] works he said I am the vine you are the
[1:04:36] branches now the branch bears the fruit
[1:04:39] not divine the vine just energizes the
[1:04:43] branch and if the branch ever bring
[1:04:45] forth a big sort of branch it it has
[1:04:49] grapes on it and the next vine comes out
[1:04:52] and the branch out of the vine will have
[1:04:55] grapes on it if the first church that
[1:04:58] have come out all of the back of the
[1:05:00] vine was a Pentecostal church with all
[1:05:03] the gifts if that ever really
[1:05:05] puts out another bands that will write
[1:05:08] another book of that behind it and that
[1:05:11] is what they had in the days of the
[1:05:15] Apostles and the Apostolic age never
[1:05:18] ended I believe that 100% you never did
[1:05:22] end hallelujah so now we understand why
[1:05:35] the spiritual temple surpasses the glory
[1:05:41] of the first and the second temple why
[1:05:46] because in John 14:27 a you shall know
[1:05:51] that I am in my father and ye are in me
[1:05:56] and I in you what does this mean perfect
[1:06:01] oneness kiss the word you are the word
[1:06:08] hallelujah amen
[1:06:12] why is it so glorious hallelujah the
[1:06:17] first temple the Shekinah glory came
[1:06:20] into it the second temple God that was
[1:06:25] made manifest in the flesh pricks into
[1:06:28] it what about the spiritual temple the
[1:06:31] bride of Jesus Christ even the
[1:06:35] bridegroom became one with a bride or
[1:06:38] Jesus side that's why it's so glorious
[1:06:40] hallelujah this is the culmination of it
[1:06:45] all Revelation chapter 21 verse 2 and
[1:06:49] for 2 to 4 and I John saw the holy city
[1:06:55] the New Jerusalem coming down from God
[1:07:00] out of heaven you know that's the bride
[1:07:03] amen
[1:07:05] that Mount the mountain that pushes out
[1:07:08] of the earth is our physical habitation
[1:07:12] amen but the inhabitants God saw them in
[1:07:15] Revelation 21 is that
[1:07:19] I John saw the holy city the New
[1:07:21] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:07:24] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:07:28] her husband and I heard a great voice
[1:07:31] out of heaven saying behold what does it
[1:07:34] say the tabernacle of God is with men
[1:07:38] and he will dwell with them and they
[1:07:42] shall be his people talk about oneness
[1:07:44] and God himself shall be with them and
[1:07:48] be their God and God shall wipe away
[1:07:50] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[1:07:53] no more death neither sorrow nor crying
[1:07:57] neither shall any more there shall be
[1:08:01] more pain for the former things are
[1:08:04] passed away oh my lord hallelujah the
[1:08:17] second temple was more glorious and yet
[1:08:20] it too was destroyed 70 80 it was
[1:08:25] destroyed and burnt down by the Romans
[1:08:28] and the veil was rent but you know what
[1:08:34] the priest did is sewed the veil back
[1:08:37] together again and the people continued
[1:08:41] to worship God and it was called vain
[1:08:45] worship for ten thirty seven more years
[1:08:48] they worshiped God in that temple and
[1:08:52] God left already left the temple on the
[1:08:56] day of the day Christ died on the cross
[1:08:59] hallelujah God left the temple the mercy
[1:09:04] seat is not in that holy holy holy of
[1:09:07] Holy's anymore the mercy seat is hanging
[1:09:10] on the cross Alleluia and the mercy seat
[1:09:13] today is in the heart of the baby
[1:09:15] oh my glory to God no tada hallelujah
[1:09:24] I got some more slides here let me
[1:09:28] finish you don't mind
[1:09:30] the voice of design urban said now if
[1:09:34] the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God who
[1:09:38] I have proven by the Bible promised that
[1:09:42] he would return in the last days and
[1:09:43] reveal his self in the fullness of his
[1:09:46] spirit is that a promise this is the
[1:09:50] head coming to the body just like the
[1:09:53] church coming up like it comes from a
[1:09:58] human being all the way from the feet
[1:10:02] comes up through the thighs up to the
[1:10:05] head and the head is the head of the
[1:10:11] body and the body has come up ever since
[1:10:16] the first church come right on up in
[1:10:20] this in the reformations has come up
[1:10:24] till now it's gone through justification
[1:10:28] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:30] now it's the head Christ coming to the
[1:10:35] body the body of Christ he's the one who
[1:10:39] knows my hand don't know how to act just
[1:10:44] by my head but he's the one who knows
[1:10:47] that's the reason he is the word and the
[1:10:54] head has now come to the body therefore
[1:10:58] the body can do nothing from what the
[1:11:01] head dictates hallelujah
[1:11:04] everyone said I am NOT the word I am a
[1:11:08] man but you see he uses this body
[1:11:12] because he died to sanctify this body I
[1:11:17] say amen to that
[1:11:18] that he might use it in start talking
[1:11:22] about just his body he's talking about
[1:11:25] the body of Christ is talking about the
[1:11:29] bride of Jesus guys it's something about
[1:11:31] you and me hallelujah that he might use
[1:11:34] it and and give a gift just like pulling
[1:11:38] it out of gear then the Holy Spirit
[1:11:41] takes over
[1:11:45] that's why we become one unit to the
[1:11:48] holy spirit how can we ever come against
[1:11:53] the will of the holy spirit if we have
[1:11:56] one unit with him hallelujah we become
[1:12:01] the word the Bible says not to be
[1:12:06] equally yoked together with unbelievers
[1:12:09] now if the Bible commands that then
[1:12:14] Jesus has to feel fulfilled that himself
[1:12:16] he cannot marry anything outside of the
[1:12:20] world he cannot marry a denominational
[1:12:25] Church hallelujah he can only marry the
[1:12:30] word he can only be one with the word
[1:12:34] Jesus had perfect faith perfect faith he
[1:12:39] said it he had it and it come because he
[1:12:44] was the word and you become the word you
[1:12:50] become the word as you received the word
[1:12:53] so much I like that I like that I
[1:12:58] received the word dear you become the
[1:13:03] word as she received the word if you
[1:13:07] abide in me and my words in you my words
[1:13:09] with this word abides in you then ask
[1:13:12] what you will and it will be done for
[1:13:15] you see if you say to this mountain be
[1:13:18] moved and don't doubt but believing but
[1:13:21] that what you've said then you shall
[1:13:24] have what you said when you pray believe
[1:13:27] that you receive what you ask for and
[1:13:29] you shall have it it will be given unto
[1:13:32] you
[1:13:34] time-space nothing ever will ever change
[1:13:38] it you know it's done it's already over
[1:13:44] with that's why we sing that song it's
[1:13:48] already done Alleluia the word coming to
[1:13:54] the body Jehovah Jireh said but remember
[1:13:58] the last thing is this divine presence
[1:14:02] the word itself he is the word the head
[1:14:08] the word it's coming to the body see and
[1:14:13] that word in Hebrews the fourth chapter
[1:14:17] said the Word of God is sharper more
[1:14:20] powerful than any two-edged sword and is
[1:14:23] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[1:14:25] of the heart
[1:14:26] now take that scripture and run it right
[1:14:29] back from the beginning of the prophets
[1:14:32] run it right on down through Jesus
[1:14:34] Christ and see if that isn't the same
[1:14:36] thing the same thing that is known as
[1:14:39] the Messiah now it's not some man that's
[1:14:44] the Messiah it's the Holy Spirit is the
[1:14:49] Messiah Christ and the Holy Spirit is
[1:14:54] the same thing so here it is here now
[1:14:59] working in the flesh getting the body
[1:15:03] ready for the rupturing base believe it
[1:15:06] friends and then he said these final
[1:15:11] words the trial we started discerning
[1:15:16] some people and then after discerning
[1:15:23] their names and their illnesses and
[1:15:26] pronouncing them them healed he said
[1:15:29] this I challenge you to believe that
[1:15:33] Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of
[1:15:37] a son of man in human flesh through the
[1:15:42] bride's body is that accept his call not
[1:15:48] by might nor by power but by my spirit
