========================================

other way no I'm sorry I get it straight from my banner I don't call anybody wonder say they have died from you today okay what that game has that recessive gene pointing I want more I quit school go to reset yeah alright now we're gonna finish up today and what we're going to do is is go over a few points and then you can go back review Bob is still working on the chart I hope it don't think as long as it took me to bring this chart he's he's finding tunity it's fine to me alright fine tuned charts up and defined terms the chart he's not putting the media file and then he's gonna send it to all your email addresses so you can pull it up and look at it yourself at home and you can you know Rebecca did you get anything more about them the Bob's gonna he's fine tuned and he's gonna stay tuned everybody mail address see we pulled it off of the computer the other day and it's so small you have to you have to expand it in sections and read it and then then downsize that go over here expand it read it because if you put the whole chart on this right here it'd be limp word would be ten times smaller than that you know you're at the Pennsy in someone that's why we're back is gonna try to she's got one of those machines that work that does not yep that does the that does stuff like that you know there's a way to do it that you see back consider this big you know and then he'll uh trying the label brother you know because whatever Jake is right hanging on the wall so right right now I want to get out one thing there's been brother Rhino minutes in this whole entire ministry he drew three charts that are very prominent and the message all right number ones interchanges all right you go to her textbook open it to the front it shows the seven churches and the messenger beach age when he's begun when it ended and then remembered though the Holy Ghost came back afterwards and drew the chart on the back wall showing that the chart was correct so it never has to be filled with or moved or changed because the doctrine of William Bratton right so then the second chart didn't add is the one behind your back over there and this one which is the stack of a bourbon man and their habit change this one ever change the doctrine now many people have changed his doctrine for us okay so we didn't really speak much of the chart except using it but I'm going to read you some quotes here that brother Graham said about the chart cuz he drew this chart and see man has put the Holy Spirit here and here and you can't get it to you can appear and this is this and this is that but brethren I would never say that I was wrong and I had to change the chart I believe when the man drew a chart that means that is a perpetual almost like the Bible the Bible was written they found the scroll they just they didn't interpret what he said they just translated off of that page right onto your Bible okay so there was no interpretation between that now once he got on the page man has had many interpretations today man is gonna open this Bible in about 3,000 different denominations and preach the same preached three thousand different messages out same book same way was a message so I believe brother round then he threw the chart for the day and seventy weeks and for those of you that are listening in that are watching it now watch I don't know if it's you or so made in other parts of the country but they watched a bunch up to a point must have got bored and didn't that's gift about five and now they start to watch them all over again you know back over again so but on you that missed it this chart was drawn by Rebecca Branham you'll remember brother battle makes a comment about it in the seventy weeks of Daniel I don't know not be said that you know he said Becky this looks like a woman but it'll do for now so and then brother George Smith verified that this is what Rebecca group and come off of a memo graph piece of paper the she transferred it to because look at this type that's that old typewriter back in the 60s okay you know typing and she drew it out just like brother I'm good right here so I want to go to the 70th week Nathaniel Coe this is where he started using the chart in the 70th week of Daniel 1961 they'll be able to sit open up riding spray it spray alright open up our eyes and ears of understanding today and as I endeavoured to bring forth this great question and clear it into people's mind well about that clear it into people's money Louise you're looking you're looking fresh I feel fresh you okay alright no if you don't bring you that unfresh missing yeah alright thanks for all the prayers okay now I'm gonna talk about you looking fresh good things you know I don't like you but I miss entrusting why not say hi so let me go back just for say brother Graham big three charge he do the church ages and the angel verified he drew the Statue of a perfect man never had a change of the man history has many doctrines of the statue of a perfect man right but now brother ground never change chart so now we're coming to the nineteen seventy weeks which is the third chart that he drew this chart actual piece of paper they're not this actual piece of paper but what's on it was memo graph through the years from what sister Rebecca brown copied off the chalkboard or the blackboard remember they didn't have these in chalkboard you deal with chalk and to draw it out so Becky drew this the chart only on the blackboard after Brad on Tabernacle the night that he preached this message the 70th week of Daniel that was verified by brother George Smith okay Rebecca this is what she given it says here chart of Daniel seventy weeks as drawn by brother William Brown so this is the chart we've been using the brother round ever in his life changed this one either he brought three charts now that's I'm looking for it but I can't find it does anybody have the ones that I gave out that he drew on a napkin at a restaurant several days afterwards and it's the exact same chart and brother Branham signed it I guess now this was given to us by brother Keith Brown said his his dad brother Homer Brown got this wrong brother and it says he's wrong my brother William Brown for a brother that was out a restaurant with brother on them in 1961 right it's same identical charge so brother had never changed and never said because listen if you draw something down and visualize what if brother round would have preached the seven sages and then when the seals open God said no there's eight brother Brown what the had go went back and said look do away with this chart are add this to it because they've been added revelation I don't believe that's true in any of these charts because it's that's that's the law thank you a perfect man seven church ages and the Daniel seventy weeks chart but I'm going to read you some quotes about what he says about your chart so it's this is the mouth of two or three witnesses two witnesses program drew the same turning in later in a restaurant and they copied it off on a sheet of paper they to use somebody say it was a napkin but that's okay number may know what example loneliness the same as this one if it was never without a problem but it's the same thank chart alright drawn by William Brown this is where program druid itself so he drew it right out of memory back off with when he had on a blackboard which was this one that sister Rebecca drew while he was preaching this sermon right here all right so who's for this is the Treaty of this year I need some company to that but we're out of coffee I've got copies of the others but it don't have copies of that one so I need to make some copies of that so now brother Brown tells for the 70th week of Daniel he's praying to the Lord opened up our ears of understanding today as I endeavor to bring forth this great question and clear it into people's minds he doesn't he sound confused no he'll tell me now I have it written out here Lord upon paper and also drawn upon this blackboard this chart but totally insufficient to explain now we call on you the great master who wrote the word who inspired it who gave it to the prophet Daniel and we pray that you'll send the inspiration this morning in these last days that he said the book would be closed until this time that you will open our understanding and there'd be a soft bedded faith and a heart that will let the word take hold and life and bring forth the trees of righteousness in our life that it's intended to do okay he says they man these starts the sermon all right now watch he's coming up to its tournament oh what a lesson I said to my wife the other day I wonder if the people are really getting it now I want you to get it don't sound like he's a little foggy with this does it I want you to get it if you have to stay here all day long just stay and now we won't forget it see we want to know that it's true and if you can just only see it and I'll ask maybe and then after I'm gonna leave the chart hanging here and you can draw it out afterwards coming here this afternoon whenever you want to and draw out the chart and so forth it'll help you to understand that sound like something I can for you to do that's the reason I put it there so that you would understand it okay so we went back to the chart and he reviews back over and we went through all the books last Sunday now in it about they've been one week left after the rapture now if we read in the Bible they've got 57 same message that there are 70 weeks determined upon the people and that has nothing to do with the church seventy weeks has nothing to do with Church church age especially looking right here at the gap if you notice here on the chart I've got the church ages in between those seventy weeks not sixty nine and a half huh okay some brother down from Georgia daughter fours overhead we went to the Turk agency but Sunbrella through this chart but remember the Holy Spirit through the chart on the back of the wall all right so brother biden confirmed god confirmed the devils correct all right now he's explaining through a paragraph 99 now remember he was cut off on the sides you cease to deal with them and they did not go any further than they were scattered by the roman empire that was in AD 70 all right I destroyed the temple then if you notice on my chart here we'd refer back to the chart I want you to get this now don't you notice where I got the cross the hold on this is an explanation that people don't get they're saying that that the when Jesus died here at Calvary where this cross is on the chart that that was their thing there's only three and a half years left but the Bible says after 62 weeks shall Messiah be cut off notice where I got the cross that's where they rejected but the time extended a little further from that thirty forty fourth you're doing right here or left over and that's where what Titus destroyed the Jerusalem in AD 70 all right 40 years later but what a t-33 or he'd be 37 years later he died maybe 30 40 years later tie this the Roman general destroyed everyone scatter the people to all the world see Titus 40 years later oh my god that see I ain't referring back to this chart all right no yes explaining the 80 30 1933 difference well if you'll look even look Schofield Schofield uses pusher which puts Jesus at 80 30 but if you look at the cuff you guys go fill the Bible if you look at the top he even says a t-33 so there's a discrepancy when Jesus was born but we know that Jesus was born before BC making him 33 years old in 1830 the times going down that's correct BC 4 3 2 1 not a 0 go back to 1 and that makes 33 brotherbrother that he was 33 years old and then remember all the 1830s sometimes brother Brown will say a t-33 slip of the tongue he might be hiding it from somebody I don't know but you can't make that number fit but you can make a t30 fit every time if I got that every time you can make a t30 fit but you can't make a t-33 fit now he's thinking 1933 is when he got the vision Jesus was 30 30 he said well why did he say that if he was so perfect he was still a man and God listen Jesus said to eat my flesh and drink my blood and walked off now he explained that is we in a South he didn't explain it he explained earlier well sure brother branham was a human man and that Holy Spirit had to go through that filter to speak so when he's in a t-33 he's thinking Jesus being 33 he's thinking 1933 because remember he gets over that he says from 33 to 77 that's when those visions came in 1933 so I'm telling you you've got to go back to the facts back is 80 30 is where everything fits the closest 33 it's off by years okay and even right here look brother ramble on his chart row 80 30 so if Jesus was born for PC but Bob's got it on his chart he even puts the numeration out because you can't have a zero year if he was born in 4bc they they know he was born between 4 & 6 BC because Herod died somewhere in there yeah right parrot gave the decree to kill all the children that were 2 years old and either so right in there for BC somewhere and that's where Jesus was born okay then in 80 30 he was crucified Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday there's a quote in here I'm not gonna read it for them I'm reading about the church but call the nineteen seventy weeks Jesus realism threw them on white donkey they pull the second 8030 and with crucified several days later need a ride and Duncan lifts three more you know that was when they settled down to the king in one week are less than a week later he was dead at that Friday if you're gonna pass over right and that's another thing that this police have brought me some things that we did in 2009 we did a lot of this with the charge and with the Jewish time and the calendars remember one thing because see if you say well Friday they had to get him off the cross before 6 o'clock Passover started 6 o'clock the day before yes the upper room remember they went to the upper room and then he was killed the Passover start because they were going for the Passover meal the Passover meal to us was on Thursday but their Friday starts at 6 o'clock on Thursday the evening in the morning of the first day you know all Jewish people start a new day at 6 o'clock 6 p.m. ok when we come to see 2 o'clock this afternoon till I sit still society till midnight thanks to the Jews at 6 o'clock that's there well they had their Sabbath yesterday but that is our if we were Sabbatarians we would hold our Sabbath at 6 o'clock this afternoon we wouldn't do anything until 6 o'clock might be afternoon see so you have to because of that coming up you've thought about that though Jesus had a Passover meal but it was on Thursday he had two Passover meal on Friday evening he either had been killed on Saturday hey I found that yeah absolutely so it's six o'clock on Thursday details at the sample of look we got the Passover meal coming at 6 o'clock he eats the Passover dinner says this is my flesh this is my blood which I've given to you he goes through the evening of the Garden of Eden comes down to the next day he's at pilots hall they crucified between 3 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon remember I'm sitting on the cross they had to get him down before 6 o'clock because that was a high Sabbath coming up a hot abbath coming up yeah which was the leaven bread started on next day they had to get him off the cross so they'd have to leave him on cross for a whole day and in that humidity it had been horrible but they took him down before 6 o'clock very simple very simple but you got to pay attention we think going in our 24 hour day you got to thinking over there for when I say we're dying of seven new weeks you don't think in a Jewish time period Jewish time Jewish months Jewish years do it calendars everything got to be doing listen they don't care what what day we have over here they go by their day that's never affected the Jews since the beginning of time they melted well with the Gentiles I think will change you make the do come change don't wait juvenile change in God changing right I mean really starts from juniper so anyways I just want to say it the Bible / though he was killed in 1830 the boss says after 62 weeks the Messiah was cut off so we prove that there was right here seven weeks and sixty-two weeks after 62 weeks the reason brother Brown a marked April the 2nd that's when the sixty-two weeks stop so after 62 weeks Messiah was cut off why would he say that April the 2nd 1830 he was marking the time just like we're marking towns now the brother Randall was looking in that whatever encyclopedia and all that he was looking in he marked that time period after 62 weeks my silos cut off now look and of course you know that's what the preacher in the message did Oh after 62 weeks so it was three and a half years listen I'm gonna go to Walmart after I leave Church I spring quick but I'm going upstairs after we finish here when this Bible study is finished we're going upstairs how long it's gonna take it's two minutes but it's accurate it's accurate after 62 weeks of Messiah be cut off and that's exactly what right here all right there on my chart is to know up now ministry from Luke them to land of Pentecost in little bitty minority that's reasons a lot homo still down the stage there on the calendar on the chart is to Pentecostal ages from others are you don't hear not picked off the denomination because they've done just act like a layout of sins they are allowed as they are lay on the scene they did like a nick 11 but the true church see we're going in here here snow was coming down hit the image we're going rapture we shorted on another chart that we had right there I got that now watch he's talking my book the next service he has which is two days later it's called the house he's referring back to that same chart he didn't get a new revelation or tell about a tow-truck them and here's what happened the raptured Saints as you notice on the chart Sunday by him he's referring back to that chart that he grew two days earlier he must have been preaching on cue tonight because this is August the 8th and he preached the seventh week of Daniel on august 2 6 I think he preaches got house in Macon I think so but it does show it on here they will actually travel for two days maybe and priest being away he's referring back to the chart everybody got that okay whole thing so I believe that this chart is very true he wants you to he didn't just say well I'm going to draw this now change it no I think this is this is the way that the bank in two weeks is supposed to be it's just exactly the way that right so now I said ten o'clock would stop it being quite anybody any questions so far any questions comment go to them go one more thing and then we'll be finished because we're going to go back into this six fold purpose once we get into the to the seal then all right because we didn't really cover everything we kind of went through it but everybody got their chart of this if you don't I got several more working by now you got this we studied this just a little while if you don't have them there's several up here for you to get but the key to the whole thing is they stick for purpose because the six whole purpose happens and the last 17th week because let me ask you let me ask the question was Israel's transgression applied at calorie what brother Brown said brother Ramsey died for everybody did you start him down we accepted him but it will be applied see he finished look he finished everybody's transgression he ended everybody staying at Calvary but my question the other day was to those in Alabama I said look Jesus died once for all took the keys of death and helped heal his destroyed death is destroyed come on some people still die unbelief we got to get this word right once we get this word right then it will be applied we haven't applied to our soul right now by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then please make sure you've got the Holy Ghost in your goal let's know it's time to put playing all right don't stop Peter people paddling around a little bit get the word born you ever have a form that's right when brother Brian preached the rapture message he went to that songs where talks about hide me and not pavilion to a lot of people that's the strangest scripture ever used for a rapture message but you gotta think about what that's saying hide me in your pavilion let me go into your pavilion because outside for me and we're gone we're dead we got to hide in his pearly nice crowd okay so the Bible says that there are six things that gotta be done finish the transgression make an end of sin reconciliation for iniquity bringing emulation righteousness fill up the vision and prophecy not the most holy that has to happen inside of the 70 weeks of Daniel yeah now God started the redemption of mankind in the garden actually before the garden we know he was laying in the loo listen let's get down here let's get in this three dimensions right here where we're at okay cuz it was a landfill and four foundational world well why do we have to struggle we got something to doing this these dimensions right here and I'm working on sermon over dimensions and I think you'll really like it because uh that's what happens when God in the Garden of Eden he withdrew his cell remember he could come down in the cool of the day and walk with Adam face to face see God coming through also having dimension did not bother him a bit he owns them all he owned the hook he set him up he owned them all so he can walk through along but by the word he is limited I'll put enmity which is what Satan did put enmity between God and man that God put enmity what is enmity division he put a division that's why in hell has just looked over at Abraham and said there's a great gulf fixed when it's fixed that means you can't move in other words there was no way for Lazarus to go back I mean the rich young ruler sorry to go back toward Lazar there was a great gulf fixed what God fixed that Gulf now God can come down in this dimension but he closed up these three dimensions for a purpose now he can come down in spirit form but he cannot come down human flesh form yes sure why you say Jesus that was a human flesh that was born on earth not a glorified body I'm gonna make this thing man and I think I can back it up God had a flash the whole time God had fleshed the whole time just when he had to come out of that first three dimensions which is life life matter our length height and depth he won't go back into that because that's where sin is that's where it happened it didn't happen in the first day in the fourth dimension of the fifth dimension though those were all set up for things afterwards all right that's why the fourth dimension man the fourth dimension look it's just ruling through here right now roaring through there we can pick up anything all kind of stuff you pick up but it's closed off and only a little while can an angel come in or something happen because if we were able to look into another dimension we would see angel let me give you another little key them to chew on until I do the sermon you don't get a revelation in this dimension all right that's you don't get a revelation in this dimension this is life light matter this is living your daily life this is doing your daily duty this is you and your wife your family and your kids you don't get a revelation in estimation it has to come from another dimension into this now when we get that revelation that portal is going to open and we can go out this one in the other that dimension is in here okay oh man now we got your dancin we go away but I got a quote and I don't know where read it I really did I wanna read it I've been but I was thinking about Jesus and I want you to listen to this and I was not even looking for this I was studying on something that I read through some quotes but I hadn't put it with notes do I have to find it again I think I told you then brother Brown said the quote he said when Jesus was on Calvary god shut off the major so he could die God shut off the vision I've never read that before going Jesus on no Calvary God shut off its vision that's why he said my God my God my hands now over second man right so anyway when we say that people have to make up you never been right before or ever why do you think when he preached in tomato they'll run their run Oh from the back of the church to the front now get right up in your face that if we did that I told Louise I don't do that in one day three you making that happen and I thought that was coming to get me to take me out here comes two of them come out late with the center aisle and they come down that center alley for once so anyway there's more to dimensions than just being in a dimension these are these dimensions are here for a purpose everyone out of 4/5 saying it all up to the seventh dimension but you don't get a revelation in this dimension that revelation you get come from a seventh dimension it comes from the dimension that God thing because same thing give you revelation and you your personal self cannot give your self a revelation that's man's idea that turns these charts in all these different ideas but if we can get that portal open from the seventh dimension perfection and bring it to here and get the revelation then that's what revelation is gonna take us back there know that a false doctrine has to come to me from the fourth dimension demons travel and the fourth dimension and I'm studying you ought to read some of this stuff I mean you're talking about over something else because you go into what's that Stephen Hawking and all these people that are like way out somewhere they've done they know what dimensions are you know they'll twist them around and turn around but the most of your commentary will tell you that there is a fourth dimension that is calm but there's the fourth dimension as you continue to the fourth dimension this it goes chaos to hell now program said demons traveling fourth dimension but let me tell you something when you're talking on the phone to a believer you're talking in the fourth dimension so there's come then you keep going down further and further because I've always believed there's dimensions inside of dimension because when program went to the sixth dimension he didn't seek all right and Paul's group comes remember he asked a question he said did Paul make it went out he was looking at Paul he no Paul man so he's Church age their own dimension inside of that six dimension has to be and you know why because you know what they need to be kept separate until all things come back new because they with the understanding you know with tall people when in as Paul's group brother Brennan you know all the people that brother Joe was preaching on the right we're resting on that well that was brother Browns group that come under his ministry the millions just gonna be under his ministry he saw them the NC poultry Iranians Martin all of us anyway get off on that all right finish the transgression make an interstate a reconciliation for iniquity I guess that's all right I think there's level 10 dimensions and there's there's you can't say dimensions inside dimension what you can because there's some wall some wall inside web dimension that's why said the fourth dimension starts out calm and works its way to chaos and then works its way to hell it just keeps going down come on ously if you're listening to a tape online brother brown voices coming through the fourth winter if you listen to brother Vail or any of these brothers if you're listening to them online right and there's no hard connection it's kind of do that way is that right yeah what huh all that then you're listening in the fourth dimension it's coming throughout the fourth dimension it's not coming out all the god it's not coming but it's using the fourth dimension because ruin listen look forget it we gotta get faced with that change yeah I'll research later we'll talk about it I've already talked today about a little bit so anyway gonna look first read first three big since they dimension first three of the six vote purpose every bit of this was offense to Calgary but wasn't applied obviously it wasn't applied got blind in their eyes until what until a Gentile bride to be brought in right so then what's going to happen in that seventy weeks of Daniel he's gonna finish the transmission make an understand my reconciliation for iniquity how three to profits okay now if the aid if those damn Sam Louise ends as most people in the message believe then it ends right here where's you have three because six seals are six-fold redemption finishes finished six on purpose finishes their redemption the six seals finishes our redemption a man ma'am alright we get seal one two three four five six because it because there's early nineteen redemption in seven Christ is seven see this brother Graham says snake seals finishes redemption right so six full purpose finishes Israel's Redemption but you gotta add the land and the city in this one see this is God's Temple Mount amen but the Jews have to have a little temple because God promised that the Son of David will sit on a throne you can spiritual out there if you want there but the Bible said he come sit on the throne and judge the twelve tribes of Israel well he's going to be there winning his wife right right that puts us in here too but you got you can't bring in everlasting righteousness you can't do all six in that three and a half year period to me that's just common sense right you can't bring in everlasting righteousness fill up the vision and prophecy and on the most holy and then destroy everything and about water again and then you got to start all over again no.2 may have just don't fit but if you'll do it like this that fit after the Battle of Armageddon that Jubilee year bring in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy what why do you gonna need to be made known anymore we're done we're finished we at that time the bride listen to me the bride at that time has no dimension listen people whom we get that glorified body and we move over and let this world get burned off what limitations doing that none you give it more defined body you're just as Jesus Christ amen cuz the Bible said were heirs and doing heirs with Jesus Christ if he gets the glorified body they can walk through the wall and still eat and enjoy himself we get a body they can walk through a wall those new dimensions fly in dimension bank for all right the only there's only one limitation in the Millennial Satan is still here but he's family okay but he will be destroyed at the end of that thousand years but now to me and you once we get a glorified body Saints destroy it anyway he's not even he's not even in the picture he can never come back into the picture that's why they st. can move through these dimensions - he speaks like God he's like I didn't say what Gotti glad God he can travel through I don't believe in going to six dimension but surely even going five surely he's had four and he is definitely in one term in 13 his name so he saying to move through these dimensions - but he can't come in his own body cuz he right I'm combining he has to work through somebody we got a guy who's got his own body but then God told us one day we'll have a body like his glorious mother yeah that connects us back puts the the the DNA picture back together that we didn't talk about the floor but that six for purpose has to end the seventy weeks of them seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to finish the transgression make an end of sin by reconciliation for iniquity bring in everlasting rocks and still at the beach the property of normal totally know therefore and understand so what happened that one scripture the whole advance anyway seventy weeks are determined to do these six things and these six things have to happen inside of dang seventy week take your parentheses start it started 445 BC and then end it right here has to happen we read those quotes last Sunday some of them seem to be contrasted seem to be country but there's no way the brother Brennan can break scripture cannot good he's talking about the Ministry of Jesus Christ there's only in a seven-year ministry of Jesus Christ three and a half years there three and a half years here so in the last part of that 70th week he's talking about them the same he brings in my side my side my side on my side on my side my side Jesus Jesus dealers right but to me it's very simple but he say hidden mystery I'm telling you it is a mystery it has to come from the dimension that he started from the mind God had come okay so and I believe that you know as far as I'm concerned we've tried to bring it the best way we could and to give you both you know I'll just give you my angle this accessory is not supported by this out then well it is - anyway any more any question means they should not be a question in your honor I think we've combed this one as much Edwin Coleman okay and you know what don't fuss and argue with people if I start arguing about names at least everybody on ok you think about one preacher said it's a sham care you don't come back sitting under the table some I want to know how you react but it causes a lot of contention but you know what the words made to be preached it's not neat they're not made to be hid under a bushel that's why I brought out in 1977 the land in and and you know that's preaching the way you doing I don't let no that stuff bother me nobody don't don't listen that's okay that really come in right now go by the man you know you Jesus does not come down one day and like you said he said you don't have to preside father mother sister brother both of us all what you're doing don't be a fanatic listen don't be a fanatic when we get closer if it does happen in plane I think a fence will show us what's coming you hear me events will follow what word we
