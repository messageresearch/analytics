[2:08] father we thank you for your grace and
[2:10] your love unto us
[2:12] thank you for our great opportunity to
[2:14] be able to stand and say
[2:16] he is risen
[2:18] because i know within our
[2:20] heart that it's not just he has and some
[2:23] thought or idea that we talk about
[2:26] some place in time or history or
[2:28] something that we speak about but it's a
[2:31] personal experience within our own very
[2:33] hearts and lives
[2:35] that you're living inside of each one of
[2:37] us
[2:38] and that's a wonderful thing when you
[2:41] sent a message back to the disciples it
[2:43] says tell them he is risen
[2:45] you knew what you were going to do and
[2:47] what was going to take place and you
[2:48] were right there with them and you've
[2:50] been here with us all of these years all
[2:52] of these
[2:53] for 2 000 years preaching a message on
[2:56] the resurrected lord jesus christ
[2:59] now we're coming down to the end time to
[3:01] see it
[3:02] and to realize that lord all of these
[3:04] things are taking place in the last days
[3:06] is the signs and the wonders and the
[3:08] things that are supposed to be here to
[3:11] see you manifest yourself among us
[3:14] and we ask you to just bless each one
[3:17] open the eyes of our understanding to
[3:19] thy word as we speak this morning and
[3:21] have your way in jesus name
[3:24] amen
[3:26] we've been on ephesians for a while
[3:28] we're trying to pick up the thoughts
[3:31] of predestination
[3:34] made plain and i don't know how much
[3:36] more we're going to continue our
[3:37] thoughts
[3:38] but we just keep picking up the
[3:40] scriptures and going on with it so we go
[3:42] to ephesians
[3:44] 1 and verse 3.
[3:46] blessed be the god and father of our
[3:48] lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[3:50] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[3:52] places in christ according as he has
[3:55] chosen us in him
[3:57] before the foundation of the world that
[3:59] we should be holding without blame
[4:01] before him in love
[4:03] having predestinated us unto the
[4:06] adoption of children by
[4:08] jesus christ to himself according to the
[4:10] good pleasure of his will
[4:12] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[4:16] wherein he hath made us accepted into
[4:19] beloved
[4:20] in whom you have redemption through his
[4:22] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[4:25] to the riches of his grace
[4:28] wherein he has abounded toward us in all
[4:30] wisdom and prudence
[4:32] having made known unto us the mystery of
[4:36] his will what is the mystery of his will
[4:38] now to adopt us what is his will his
[4:41] will is his word
[4:43] so his word is going to tell us all
[4:45] about these things if we'll study it and
[4:48] keep going with it all right
[4:50] having made known unto us the mystery of
[4:52] his will or according to his good
[4:54] pleasure which he hath purposed in
[4:56] himself
[4:57] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[4:59] of times he might
[5:01] gather together in one all things in
[5:04] christ both which are in heaven and
[5:06] which are on earth even in him and whom
[5:09] also now what in whom also we have
[5:12] obtained an inheritance
[5:15] all right
[5:16] see there had to be a death burial
[5:18] resurrection and thing to have an
[5:20] inheritance
[5:22] we had no inheritance whatsoever
[5:26] as gentiles there's nothing that was in
[5:29] the word promised
[5:30] even the scripture says that adoption
[5:32] was pertaining to israel
[5:36] we didn't have no promises we didn't
[5:37] have no inheritance but he came to bring
[5:40] the inheritance to us
[5:42] to where that we could have eternal life
[5:44] all right
[5:46] having made known unto us the mystery of
[5:47] his will according to his good pleasure
[5:49] which he hath purpose in himself that in
[5:51] the dispensation
[5:53] of the fullness of time he might gather
[5:55] together and want all things in christ
[5:57] both which are in heaven and which are
[6:00] on earth even in him
[6:02] in whom also we have obtained an
[6:04] inheritance being predestinated
[6:07] according to the purpose
[6:09] of him who worketh all things after the
[6:11] counsel of his own will that we should
[6:14] be to
[6:15] that we should be to the praise of his
[6:19] glory who first trusted in christ all
[6:21] right go to
[6:22] galatians 4
[6:27] and we'll start verse 1.
[6:29] and i say that the heir as long as he is
[6:32] a child differs nothing from a servant
[6:35] though he be lord of all now that's
[6:38] that's a marvelous scripture
[6:42] right
[6:43] think about what it's saying
[6:45] that the air this person you know the
[6:48] children
[6:50] as long as he's a child
[6:54] he differs nothing
[6:56] from a servant though he be lord of all
[7:02] something's got to take place right
[7:05] but it's under tutors and governors
[7:08] until the time appointed of the father
[7:11] even so we when we were
[7:13] children were in bondage under the
[7:15] elements of the world
[7:19] but when the fullness of the time was
[7:21] come
[7:22] god sent forth his son
[7:24] made of a woman made under the law to
[7:27] redeem them that were under the law
[7:29] that we might receive
[7:31] the adoption of sons
[7:34] and because you are sons
[7:36] god hath sent forth
[7:38] the spirit
[7:39] of his son into your hearts cry crying
[7:42] abby father
[7:44] wherefore thou are no more a servant
[7:49] but a son
[7:50] and if a son then an heir of god
[7:54] through christ
[7:57] i got written in my
[7:59] part here
[8:01] the christ
[8:04] the christ because when you see anything
[8:05] in the scripture and it says thee before
[8:08] emphasize that and think on it the
[8:11] the
[8:12] the christ because that's what we're
[8:14] talking about father we thank you we ask
[8:16] you just now bless us together in your
[8:17] love in jesus name amen you may be
[8:20] seated
[8:23] i've always noticed that throughout the
[8:25] scriptures
[8:26] that when you
[8:28] when you find that thee it's simple it's
[8:30] emphasizing
[8:32] something very important at that part
[8:35] so that's where we're going to see our
[8:37] inheritance
[8:39] and how it comes to us all right
[8:42] but think about it now what have we been
[8:44] talking about i don't want to spend too
[8:45] much time on it
[8:47] but we you know we we do the best we can
[8:49] of trying to to express
[8:52] uh what we see about the message and
[8:54] then move on
[8:56] into
[8:57] other things
[8:58] but we've been talking about how that
[9:00] your predestination is made plain
[9:04] throughout the scriptures
[9:06] and all because that was what it was
[9:08] doing predestination was a great thought
[9:10] a great understanding to the apostle
[9:12] paul
[9:14] it might not have had much emphasis and
[9:16] i don't mean that they didn't think that
[9:18] much of it
[9:19] but say the apostles a lot of them
[9:21] didn't have
[9:22] understanding paul picked up these
[9:24] things
[9:26] and began to bring them you know to
[9:28] through the ephesians to the galatians
[9:30] to the romans
[9:31] uh each one bringing forth
[9:34] an understanding of what the scripture
[9:36] is talking about
[9:39] all right what's it talking about
[9:42] adoption
[9:45] is a marvelous thing to think of and we
[9:47] should keep it in our thoughts and i
[9:49] won't spend with just a second
[9:50] but in the bible times you had what was
[9:53] called the adoption
[9:55] and a man would have a child born into
[9:57] the family
[9:59] and that child would be a child
[10:02] all right
[10:03] but now as long as that child remained
[10:05] as we read here from galatians
[10:07] long as he remained just a child
[10:10] he never got his inheritance right he
[10:13] would only have the earnest
[10:16] but now remember the earnest of your
[10:19] salvation is the baptism of the holy
[10:21] ghost
[10:22] is that true now the earnest of your
[10:25] inheritance is the baptism of the holy
[10:27] ghost so don't degrade that point or
[10:30] think there's something wrong with it
[10:32] when we make a statement like and say
[10:34] that here comes the great apostles but
[10:36] yet paul is the greatest of all of them
[10:39] to bring the word
[10:40] you know for those the days and the
[10:43] biggest portion of the writing of the
[10:44] bible was to the apostle paul
[10:47] all right
[10:48] and he spoke of the earnest
[10:50] of our inheritance
[10:53] he spoke of predestination he spoke of
[10:55] those things uh you know that we we
[10:58] needed those tutors and governors and
[11:00] things to be able to raise us and bring
[11:02] us to the right place and and to be able
[11:05] to see what christ is trying to reveal
[11:07] to you and i
[11:08] but it's marvelous to understand the
[11:10] word and think about it see and i'm
[11:13] saying it now with the best love that i
[11:15] can
[11:16] uh
[11:17] without throwing off on anybody but i
[11:19] remember when we were back in the
[11:20] baptist and et cetera
[11:22] we talked about adoption
[11:25] we talked about inheritances we talked
[11:28] about uh the things of the bible and
[11:31] sure we had a an understanding to a
[11:33] degree
[11:34] of things that was going to take place
[11:37] and like brother brown says you you
[11:38] better leave them baptist alone because
[11:40] they they're they get settled in that
[11:43] word well see that's where he said now
[11:45] like if baptist said he'd know who it
[11:47] was he'd know his father and he'd know
[11:50] how much inheritance he had
[11:52] but yet
[11:53] he wasn't able to bring it on forth your
[11:55] pentecostals
[11:57] they could see what they was to a degree
[11:59] and bring it up to a degree and bring it
[12:01] into the new birth right around and said
[12:03] they come to the new birth but said they
[12:05] that's where they messed up they stopped
[12:07] and they said well uh you know
[12:10] we
[12:11] we've got what we have we've got this
[12:14] we're greater than the baptist they're
[12:16] over the artist they're just reading the
[12:18] word they're just reading the word you
[12:20] know and the letter of the word and
[12:22] we've got the glory and the shoutings
[12:24] and the and the things
[12:26] and all like that and the prophet said
[12:27] they cabbage down on that
[12:30] in other words they stopped
[12:32] when they come into the new birth
[12:35] well we can't afford to stop and the
[12:37] prophets was was trying to explain to
[12:40] the pentecostals he preached message
[12:43] after message directed it and exactly to
[12:46] the pentecostals because like i said now
[12:48] that i'm not throwing off with the
[12:50] baptist methodists and things like that
[12:52] they couldn't talk about the baptism of
[12:54] the holy ghost they would talk about it
[12:56] as just believing
[12:59] and just stuff like well that was good
[13:00] all of that and there's a lot of
[13:02] salvation there but still
[13:04] your pentecostals picked it up in the
[13:07] new birth and begin to express it
[13:10] but yet they couldn't understand well
[13:12] here comes the prophet picking it up
[13:13] bringing the scriptures and showing how
[13:16] that that child
[13:17] born into the family it's a child of god
[13:20] you get the baptism of the holy ghost
[13:22] you have eternal life
[13:25] in your soul you have eternal life
[13:27] all right you get justification
[13:29] sanctification
[13:31] that might just be an earnest of your
[13:33] inheritance
[13:35] until a time would come but when you
[13:37] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[13:39] see then it becomes the new birth within
[13:41] you
[13:43] and that was why the zeus street was
[13:45] such a marvelous situation to bring it
[13:47] forth that the people understood that
[13:49] new birth was the power of god the
[13:51] moving of god the gifts and the signs
[13:54] and the wonders and all that was
[13:56] wonderful
[13:57] well yet they stopped
[13:59] why because at that time then look what
[14:02] i'm saying follow me see under luther
[14:05] wesley et cetera justification
[14:08] sanctification
[14:10] that would be an earnest of the
[14:11] inheritance
[14:13] all right
[14:15] an earnest of it part payment
[14:18] all right then when the baptism of the
[14:20] holy ghost came to azusa street
[14:25] and they cabbage down on it it became an
[14:27] earnest to them the baptism of the holy
[14:29] ghost became an earnest to the
[14:31] pentecostal people because it was the
[14:33] baptism of the holy ghost it was the new
[14:36] birth
[14:37] but yet it wasn't all
[14:41] because there was more to come
[14:43] peter would say a a child sincere
[14:46] miracle you know desiring the sincere
[14:47] milk of the word that you may grow there
[14:49] by
[14:50] those apostles like peter paul and him
[14:53] they knew greater understanding peter
[14:55] preached the stature of a perfect man
[14:58] see why that paul never picked that up i
[15:00] don't understand but it's the same thing
[15:03] the statue of a perfect man with peter
[15:05] bringing it add to your faith virtue
[15:06] knowledge temperature it's the new birth
[15:10] and then growing up in the grace and
[15:11] knowledge and coming out to to the tudor
[15:14] being the holy ghost and
[15:16] it's the same message
[15:18] but paul would preach it as one way and
[15:21] peter another but not a different
[15:23] meaning now
[15:24] it was the same message brought in
[15:26] different ways
[15:28] and paul and peter never
[15:30] never differed in doctrine
[15:33] sure they might have had problems but
[15:35] they didn't differ and doctrine your
[15:36] prophet said why because the baptism of
[15:39] the holy ghost
[15:43] starts your new birth at faith
[15:46] and just starts it well that is my new
[15:48] birth i got the new birth when i was
[15:50] born again amen but
[15:52] you know what
[15:55] it was a child one day he was born from
[15:57] your mother and come forth into the
[15:58] world but what if you just stop right
[16:00] there
[16:03] what if you just stopped at that
[16:04] situation
[16:06] no see
[16:07] then what you have today i've always
[16:09] tried to say this in the right way
[16:11] listen
[16:12] what you have today
[16:14] is marvelous if you believe it and
[16:16] accept it and want it present tense
[16:19] because see if it is then tomorrow
[16:23] hasn't got here yet but when tomorrow
[16:25] comes what you had today is just in
[16:27] earnest
[16:30] do you understand that it's just an
[16:31] earnest
[16:33] what you had
[16:34] what you had you moved on to something
[16:37] else something more marvelous
[16:40] to an understanding of god's word
[16:43] and that way you can see that peter and
[16:45] pauline was preaching the same thing
[16:47] paul preached it peter preached it as
[16:49] the virtues and things you know statue
[16:51] of perfect man paul preached it as the
[16:54] tutor the governors and the things and
[16:56] all like that and teached it as an
[16:58] adoption message
[17:00] and it's the same
[17:02] message but it's a growth development of
[17:05] the same message
[17:07] as it just continues on
[17:09] growing greater and greater and see then
[17:12] here comes the prophet
[17:14] with the message to the zeus street
[17:17] people not that he was a uh you know a
[17:20] pentecostal anything like that i'm just
[17:22] saying it to the weight he comes to
[17:23] bring the message there and then go on
[17:26] because see they stopped
[17:28] oh we've got it what do you mean brother
[17:30] branham we need this we know we've got
[17:32] the gifts we've got the signs we've got
[17:34] the wonders and they had it right
[17:38] that's right
[17:40] big man stood right here one day and
[17:41] said then pentecostal said they didn't
[17:43] have nothing
[17:45] well
[17:47] i told him before then that they did
[17:51] of course that didn't change him
[17:53] because you see he was he was the top
[17:55] guy you know
[17:56] and i was a peanut you know trying to
[17:58] talk to him but it was true what i said
[18:03] because the baptism of the holy ghost is
[18:05] your new birth
[18:07] but in relationship to what we're going
[18:09] out of here it's only an earnest
[18:13] see we've got to go somebody has got to
[18:15] go to a change of the body
[18:19] and that is involved in adoption
[18:22] the change of these bodies is involved
[18:25] into that adoption and the stature of
[18:27] perfect man brings a person individual
[18:29] up through there growing in grace and
[18:31] knowledge
[18:32] which is the holy ghost being the tutors
[18:34] and governors
[18:36] that would teach us those things
[18:38] well look at what i'm talking about see
[18:40] you you've got the apostle paul bringing
[18:42] a great message
[18:45] but he wasn't the only one that brought
[18:46] a great message
[18:48] peter brought a great message he brought
[18:50] the same message in just a different
[18:52] turn or way or thought or whatever a
[18:55] concept or that you could understand it
[18:59] because see to take what peter's doing
[19:01] without the rest of the word you would
[19:03] know about the governors and tutors and
[19:05] the things that would start you would
[19:07] know the adoption because peter didn't
[19:09] cover adoption
[19:11] in the wording of adoption you know in
[19:13] other words he didn't call it that he
[19:16] would call it growing in grace and
[19:17] knowledge
[19:20] i mean
[19:21] he would call it sincere milk of the
[19:23] word that we may grow there by see they
[19:25] had each one had a different way of
[19:26] expressing their thought but it was the
[19:29] same thought
[19:32] it's the same point of
[19:35] doing and having it coming to
[19:36] predestination
[19:39] what
[19:40] destiny determined beforehand
[19:44] well
[19:45] all right peter just tells you how to
[19:47] climb that pyramid
[19:52] see then
[19:53] it's not to just say one is greater than
[19:55] the other
[19:57] but yet they are cause look at it then i
[19:59] don't mind putting it this way see then
[20:00] when the prophet came in the last days
[20:04] he brought it to the apex the heights
[20:06] the growth development the thing to tell
[20:08] us about these things we wouldn't have
[20:11] known about peter and the statue of
[20:12] perfect man had the prophet not preached
[20:14] it
[20:17] he goes back there in it read it statue
[20:19] of a perfect man he said i've been
[20:20] preaching on this for 30-something years
[20:23] 30-something years he'd been preaching
[20:25] on the stature of a perfect man
[20:28] right
[20:30] to try to get the people to see
[20:34] what god is expecting out of you and me
[20:37] and it's not hard because that's what i
[20:39] say
[20:41] when you look at something and you think
[20:43] it's a hard thing well just keep
[20:44] studying
[20:47] because you may run into it like i said
[20:49] you read in paul
[20:50] and he talks of governors and tutors and
[20:53] things well we don't know nothing about
[20:55] governors and tutors because we're not
[20:58] the old testament people we're not
[20:59] english people like that or the start of
[21:01] it we're not the ones that begun the
[21:03] adoptions and things we're the gentiles
[21:06] which is grafted in and and no right of
[21:09] inheritance whatsoever for me and you as
[21:12] gentiles
[21:16] we didn't have anything
[21:18] it was to the jews
[21:21] well see then here comes peter to bring
[21:24] the message who'd he bring the message
[21:25] to
[21:27] isn't it odd the way it happened
[21:29] peter brought the message to the
[21:31] gentiles
[21:32] come on
[21:37] peter went and brought the message to
[21:39] the gentiles
[21:41] but he couldn't get them to see totally
[21:44] what it was all about maybe just using
[21:46] words
[21:47] so paul picks it up
[21:51] and he calls it
[21:53] adoption
[21:57] he calls it growing you know bringing it
[22:00] to that position
[22:01] of adoption
[22:03] all right then now we have to go back
[22:05] and see we've studied those things like
[22:06] i said we could read in the baptist we
[22:08] could read about adoption i read about
[22:10] it and could could tell you about it
[22:12] before i come into the message part of
[22:15] the adoption that to to understand i
[22:18] didn't know that it was connected
[22:20] totally into the redemption of the body
[22:23] because that was just a little bit part
[22:25] that was withholding from us but we did
[22:27] house some things
[22:30] each church age has had a word to bring
[22:33] forth
[22:35] each church age each group of people has
[22:38] a predestination
[22:40] because what is it what comes
[22:42] predestinated from god the word or seed
[22:47] the seed the word comes predestinated
[22:49] eternally in other words it's bound to
[22:51] how it's going to happen it has to
[22:53] happen it is going to take place and it
[22:56] will
[22:59] because that's what god said
[23:02] all right see we we study the bible and
[23:05] a lot of times we we we baptized all of
[23:08] the things that we've read in the
[23:10] scriptures
[23:11] and then here comes the prophet going
[23:13] right back to that word
[23:16] and taking you and i through all of
[23:18] these great
[23:19] uh avenues of adoption and all of those
[23:22] years there especially from the say the
[23:24] mid-40s or on up maybe to close to 50
[23:27] you'll hear him when he when we first
[23:29] started getting the the tapes and
[23:31] different things he starts talking about
[23:33] adoption
[23:36] and then he lays in
[23:38] something that is beautiful and
[23:39] marvelous
[23:41] he picks up malachi 4.
[23:44] sure he understood paul and peter
[23:47] and all of
[23:48] them understood those things and began
[23:51] to preach about him
[23:53] all right
[23:55] about the gifts and the different things
[23:57] but then he began to talk about malachi
[23:59] 4.
[24:02] that something was to take place
[24:05] what the message was to come
[24:08] to tie together all the loose ends
[24:11] all right so you had loose ends in your
[24:13] your adoptions you had loose ends in
[24:16] your statue of a perfect man what i mean
[24:18] by that is you had it to the point that
[24:20] the the people couldn't understand it
[24:23] they could understand the natural story
[24:25] that's what i said we understood the
[24:27] natural story we taught the adoption
[24:30] anybody can just say adoption you can
[24:32] get in there and just start reading the
[24:33] scriptures you'll find the scripture
[24:36] immediately said the adoption is not to
[24:38] the gentiles it's to the jews
[24:41] then you can go into peter and you know
[24:43] with bringing it then you can go in with
[24:44] paul bringing it and you just you just
[24:46] keep going on and on and on
[24:49] once you get the key
[24:52] well see the prophet had to bring the
[24:53] key
[24:55] see
[24:57] he brought the key
[25:01] but see the people
[25:04] no i'm
[25:05] i know people think i'm hard but
[25:08] i also remember not only what we taught
[25:10] in the baptist i remember the early part
[25:12] of this coming into this
[25:15] end time message
[25:18] like i told you one brother said one
[25:20] time he said that statue of a perfect
[25:22] man is deep i said that that uh adoption
[25:24] said that's just very
[25:26] simple it's the same thing
[25:32] it's the same point it's the same uh
[25:34] point to get to it's the same thing to
[25:35] talk about
[25:37] but see to him he could see it one way
[25:39] all right that's that's baptist i'm
[25:40] throwing that putting the point that's
[25:42] that we could see adoption
[25:45] we could see that there had to be this
[25:47] it had to be that and we could talk
[25:48] about what happened in adoption and
[25:51] really if you'll go all the way back in
[25:52] your adoption you'll find out that
[25:54] you're romans and a lot of them was
[25:56] picking up on adoption
[25:59] and they wasn't even born again
[26:00] christians not even talking about that
[26:03] they they had the the things in their
[26:07] their own languages and ways that they
[26:09] were teaching adoption
[26:12] because what was adoption
[26:14] when the child that is born into the
[26:17] family
[26:18] he is a child at birth
[26:22] but he is not in full inheritance
[26:26] he just got the earnest of an
[26:28] inheritance
[26:30] even though he's born into the family
[26:32] and that's what paul in galatians
[26:34] reading is reading that and today with
[26:35] see paul is talking about these under
[26:38] governors and tutors
[26:40] he's an heir he's no different he's not
[26:42] no he ain't got no money he ain't got no
[26:45] death ain't got nothing that he's out
[26:46] there working with the rest of them
[26:52] no no you say well i see that's where
[26:53] you go wrong you say oh no them them
[26:55] kids they just babies they just you know
[26:57] they just no you're talking about i'm
[26:59] talking about when a kid become a child
[27:02] of a age
[27:03] it was put out there
[27:05] and given a tutor
[27:07] and when that child become the right age
[27:10] under that tutor he was adopted into the
[27:12] family
[27:13] the very family that he was born into
[27:18] and see that's the point of the of the
[27:21] peter james john all of them all of
[27:23] their teachings and that was to take
[27:26] that earnest
[27:28] new birth
[27:29] because every church age had a new
[27:31] mirror that's what i said to you over
[27:32] and over luther had the new birth
[27:36] wesley had the new birth they had a new
[27:38] birth of the age of the time they were
[27:39] there but it was eternal life in their
[27:41] soul
[27:44] but when it comes in comparison to what
[27:46] the next age is it becomes an earnest
[27:49] right
[27:52] luther had it it was running great but
[27:54] here comes wesley once wesley had
[27:56] brought the message of sanctification
[27:58] then what luther had would be just an
[28:00] earnest or talking about it or trying to
[28:04] show it then the same thing would happen
[28:06] to the
[28:07] pentecostals
[28:10] when they come in with the baptism of
[28:12] the holy ghost luther and wesley's
[28:14] message become an earnest yes
[28:19] but yet that earnest is the baptism of
[28:21] the holy ghost and that's what the
[28:22] prophet you you read all of the the
[28:24] quotes i've got for you here do whatever
[28:27] if you'll read it if you'll just get
[28:28] those messages on adoption
[28:30] they're wonderful to hear ye him's
[28:32] messages and things i used to read those
[28:35] and study those and just just enjoyed
[28:37] the things of what he was telling about
[28:39] it because he told it in a language that
[28:42] i could understand
[28:45] he said the holy ghost would come back
[28:47] some some and sometimes and have to say
[28:49] to the father said i made your son sick
[28:55] i've done this i've done that
[29:00] we said he's turned out acting just like
[29:02] you
[29:04] that's right but you know what if that
[29:06] child never did come up to act like the
[29:08] father he never was adopted into their
[29:10] family
[29:12] he stayed in the family
[29:14] he lived in the family he lived in the
[29:16] house he was in the big house you know
[29:19] he was up there with mom and daddy
[29:23] but yet he didn't have the authority
[29:27] the authority was what god wants to
[29:29] instill into his children and bring us
[29:32] to that position are you understanding
[29:37] see then as those things begin to take
[29:39] place
[29:40] a growth development is seen in the
[29:43] teachings of the
[29:44] of the disciples because that's what the
[29:47] scripture says what is it ephesians uh
[29:50] where it talks about
[29:52] he gave some apostles some prophets some
[29:54] evangelist some pastor for the
[29:55] perfecting of the science
[30:00] but you see here we come along
[30:03] we read brother branham
[30:05] i said we i'm talking about
[30:07] back in the 70s 60s and 70s
[30:12] people started talking a little bit you
[30:14] could mention adoption people just going
[30:15] haywire
[30:18] don't tell me i need anything i got the
[30:20] baptismal life i got everything when i
[30:22] believe
[30:24] he said yeah but that's just bad this
[30:25] doctrine
[30:29] but i got everything you can't tell me i
[30:31] ain't got everything i got all this
[30:34] like one brother said he said if you
[30:36] teach the statue of a perfect man like
[30:37] brother branham said you're going to
[30:38] turn the pyramid upside down
[30:42] so you see you'd try to put holy ghost
[30:44] down here for a birth and going up
[30:49] see destroying the message the prophet
[30:52] was bringing
[30:56] because they thought they knew so much
[30:58] about it
[30:59] you could mention those things and they
[31:01] just
[31:04] that's why i'm honest to say and not
[31:07] bragging nor complaining
[31:09] i just never was very popular
[31:12] because i'm sorry i just tried to be
[31:14] what i am
[31:15] i tried to teach what i believe the
[31:17] prophet said
[31:20] and tried from the from the best that i
[31:22] could in a in a line to to be a good
[31:26] brother in christ to try to help
[31:28] everybody and it just turned against him
[31:31] well that didn't hurt my feelings
[31:35] it hurt me to think about
[31:37] that people would not accept god's word
[31:41] that's what hurt
[31:44] that hurt to think about all the days
[31:47] hours like i said there are a minute ago
[31:49] when the prophet said in the statute of
[31:51] perfect man he said 30 something years
[31:55] to bring this
[31:58] how do you think he felt
[32:01] like waves somewhere somebody was the
[32:02] other day one of the ministers about how
[32:04] do you think he felt when it comes to
[32:06] the seals and he said now
[32:08] i want questions and answers on the
[32:09] seals
[32:11] he said now don't put it on anything
[32:12] else
[32:14] because we're this is what we're
[32:15] studying here said put it on the seals
[32:18] and have questions and answers
[32:23] he had one question
[32:26] fully relating to the seals another one
[32:28] close to it
[32:29] and the rest of them was women should
[32:31] they wear pantyhose or what else
[32:35] how about water baptism brother branham
[32:37] doesn't it say father son and holy ghost
[32:42] how do you think he felt
[32:46] you know if he was a school teacher and
[32:49] they put these kids in front of you and
[32:51] and you tried your best to get them to
[32:52] see what you're talking about and you
[32:54] looked there and they would just deal it
[32:56] out and you know they're not getting it
[32:57] that hurts don't
[32:59] because you've done all you can do
[33:03] that prophet not he would
[33:05] i'm sure he would go to bed at night
[33:07] crying because
[33:11] he knew they wouldn't get what he's
[33:12] talking about
[33:14] so he finally winds up on this what is
[33:16] the questions and answers read the
[33:18] letter the sixth seal he said it's gone
[33:20] from you
[33:24] and said there's no way for you to know
[33:25] it right now
[33:28] he said right around the coming of the
[33:29] lord
[33:32] but he said how do you think he felt
[33:35] did he preach all them years
[33:38] and what he was trying to bring the
[33:40] people couldn't see
[33:43] he said it's gone from you
[33:48] in other words it's not for you
[33:54] so what's happened
[33:55] god had to let 50 years pass
[34:01] and let most of the old ones
[34:05] you and me are in the class of old ones
[34:08] so don't think i'm throwing on anybody
[34:10] else i'm throwing it on me and you
[34:13] right
[34:14] we're in the class of the old ones now
[34:18] but look at the old ones that have died
[34:20] off of the message
[34:25] then how do you think i felt back there
[34:26] when i made that statement
[34:29] that the lord showed me that the biggest
[34:30] portion of people this message was going
[34:32] to die and go by the grave
[34:36] because they could not come to the
[34:37] statue of a perfect man
[34:39] or the faith that would be needed
[34:42] you think that made me feel good
[34:44] that makes my heart
[34:47] because i've spent 50 years trying to
[34:49] get you to see that
[34:55] 50 years trying to get you to see it
[34:59] but see what see the things that the
[35:01] prophet has brought us
[35:04] to see his message and what he's saying
[35:10] how would you like it that way
[35:15] but you see that's part of what we're
[35:17] supposed to be
[35:18] i have no problems i'm not down and out
[35:20] about it
[35:22] i rejoice in the fact of one thing
[35:25] i believe god has at least put the word
[35:29] here in this little building
[35:32] within your reach anyway
[35:36] i believe that
[35:38] and that don't make me big no nothing
[35:41] because it ain't never made nothing
[35:45] but when i tried my best to get you to
[35:47] see jesus christ
[35:50] what has it always been now anybody who
[35:52] wants to say this word they can do it
[35:54] what have i always taught you present
[35:56] tense
[35:59] i always taught you
[36:01] moses at the burning bush
[36:04] i am
[36:07] that i am
[36:09] that means ever present for eternity
[36:12] right
[36:14] so you see why did even just little
[36:15] things like i said when i started when
[36:17] it says there in
[36:19] the
[36:20] scripture in matthew you know he is
[36:22] risen
[36:24] not he has risen and some day will raise
[36:28] he is raised
[36:30] right now
[36:33] that's why i'm not down and out about
[36:35] the point or anything i'm trying my best
[36:38] to get us to go on
[36:41] to see who we are and what we're doing
[36:45] and to see why that paul would cover it
[36:47] like that that an error is an heir but
[36:49] yet if he don't come on to adoption and
[36:52] get into the adopted end of the family
[36:55] he stays that error that form you know
[36:57] that form until he dies but he never
[37:00] becomes into maturity
[37:11] he just remains a child
[37:17] but see at church i don't want to remind
[37:18] a child i want to i want to at least
[37:20] grow up enough to be able to say
[37:24] i believe the word
[37:27] but listen what have we been trying to
[37:29] say in this part predestination
[37:35] predestination made simple or plain
[37:39] we took the series before of of the
[37:41] baptism of the holy ghost the godhead
[37:43] and thing as to be simple and plain
[37:47] and brought out at declaring that i
[37:49] declared in 1969 in athens georgia
[37:52] declared that the baptism that the the
[37:55] church would the bride would be the
[37:56] baptist in the baptism of the holy ghost
[37:58] would be in the bride in the end time to
[38:00] be the fullness of the godhead bodily
[38:03] because that's what your prophet said
[38:06] i ain't had to change that i believe it
[38:08] i still believe it
[38:10] i'm still looking forward to that but i
[38:13] want you to see your part
[38:18] to bring out to you one of the things
[38:20] that that how many of you heard things
[38:22] out like this see the prophet said to
[38:24] the bride
[38:26] he said god is not complete without the
[38:28] bride
[38:31] turn on your internets and find me one
[38:33] one man out there it's making that
[38:35] statement no they ain't gonna make that
[38:37] statement about god like that
[38:41] because they think you're making too
[38:42] much out of the bride i'm not making
[38:44] enough out of the bride
[38:48] the bride and god are one husband and
[38:51] wife supposed to be one
[38:55] all right
[38:56] which you see
[39:01] predestination
[39:04] means a destiny is determined
[39:09] in what has been the life two or three
[39:10] messages i didn't even pick up any more
[39:12] notes and they just stayed with the same
[39:14] notes to try to get you to see because
[39:16] this is what i'm trying to get you to
[39:18] see
[39:19] in the bride of jesus christ there is a
[39:22] position
[39:23] will be reached by someone
[39:27] that will be the adoption in the form of
[39:30] the completion of adoption even to the
[39:33] fact of the body being redeemed
[39:36] amen
[39:40] somebody's going to do that somebody's
[39:42] going to stand here and say
[39:44] i'm redeemed
[39:47] you know what god's going to step on the
[39:48] scene and make it manifest
[39:50] but if we don't come to that
[39:55] what have i always tried to get you to
[39:56] see you know you can't be healed if you
[39:58] don't confess it because god can't
[40:00] override your free moral agency
[40:04] let me put it this way it ain't that he
[40:06] can't because that can't puts a big old
[40:08] word up there and you swallow it again
[40:11] he will not
[40:13] override your free moral agency let's
[40:16] put it that way
[40:18] he will not override it and heal you
[40:21] so what do you do you say buy his
[40:23] stripes i'm healed now he can step on
[40:25] the scene and make that manifest
[40:30] he cannot save you
[40:33] or won't save you
[40:35] if you don't confess because that's what
[40:37] paul is saying in the scripture well
[40:39] with the mouth which one one of them
[40:41] said it in the script but with the mouth
[40:43] the confession is made you know and with
[40:45] the heart you believe
[40:48] all right
[40:50] and see trying to get you to see that
[40:52] the adoption shows
[40:55] that we are the only people
[40:59] we the end time bride
[41:01] is the only people that will ever come
[41:03] to the position to where that they could
[41:06] walk off of this earth in a rapture
[41:11] lutheran wesleyan pentecost and all sure
[41:14] all of those ages had the baptism of the
[41:16] holy ghost for their age and time they
[41:18] had the new birth they had eternal life
[41:21] they will be there in the resurrection
[41:23] and things like that but they they
[41:26] you can't just say
[41:28] you know now i'll be there no
[41:31] it's going to take something to walk off
[41:34] of this earth
[41:38] the prophet said it what'd they say when
[41:41] the bride
[41:42] begins to say
[41:44] i and my father are one and these other
[41:47] things
[41:50] he said to shuck will pull away
[41:55] well
[41:58] he said well we we've heard that brother
[42:00] dale we've said that for years
[42:03] it's never been said from the heart
[42:05] because if it's said from the heart
[42:06] it'll work
[42:08] salvation like i'm saying you can't be
[42:10] healed until you're confessing but when
[42:12] you're confessing you're confessing from
[42:14] the heart not confessing from the mouth
[42:17] the new birth is not for you to confess
[42:19] with your mouth
[42:21] and just believe it from your heart it's
[42:23] for you to confess your from your mouth
[42:25] what is revealed in your heart
[42:28] what is alive in you
[42:34] then you can say i and my father won
[42:39] he said when the bride realizes who she
[42:41] is
[42:42] and what she's here for
[42:48] well i don't see nobody but then what
[42:50] are you doing
[42:53] if you're grown up enough that you can't
[42:55] see it i mean you you know if you if
[42:58] you're up enough in god to where you
[43:00] can't see nothing happening then you
[43:03] must be above the rest of us so come on
[43:05] i'll give you the pulpit
[43:13] because i want to get out of here
[43:16] i don't want to have to go by the grave
[43:18] i'm 80 years old be 81 in just a few
[43:20] days
[43:25] but see i want to get out of here
[43:31] i'm not afraid of what's going on out
[43:33] here
[43:37] yeah i don't i don't have any fear
[43:39] whatsoever about what satan can do
[43:42] because i know he can't do nothing that
[43:44] god won't allow him
[43:48] well i just don't see it well open your
[43:51] eyes
[43:57] i've tried to explain it do you
[43:58] understand what i just said if you can
[44:00] say you can't see it then you must be
[44:03] above those that are trying their best
[44:05] to at least be a little bit right
[44:12] so quit hollering and complaining about
[44:14] everybody else and start manifesting it
[44:17] yourself
[44:25] it's not to just say well
[44:27] we just don't know
[44:30] i've been down too long with that
[44:32] i stood back there in the 70s when these
[44:34] things was going on and tried my best to
[44:36] help people to see the word of god
[44:40] i've been preaching brother moat preach
[44:41] the statue of perfect man 1971.
[44:50] we ain't been playing around
[44:53] we've been talking about the word of god
[44:59] we've got the tapes to prove it
[45:01] we preached on the 70 weeks of daniel
[45:03] when everybody else was so scared they
[45:05] wouldn't even pick a book up
[45:07] they wouldn't even read the book
[45:09] we went to a minister's meeting on the
[45:11] daniel 70 weeks a minister's meeting on
[45:14] the daniel 70 weeks that they called
[45:16] invited us to come me and wade went
[45:19] and some of these others went because we
[45:21] had to hook it up to get an internet
[45:22] system
[45:26] but you know
[45:28] there was probably 30 there i'm just
[45:30] given a number
[45:33] about 20 of them didn't even have a
[45:34] daniel 70 week's book
[45:41] well i've never read it down yourself
[45:43] why
[45:47] oh i'm afraid i might don't be afraid
[45:49] you all ready
[45:54] you're admitting it by the fact that you
[45:55] won't read it and study it
[46:00] i don't know i'm hard i know that but
[46:02] this is going out on the internet too
[46:05] they can listen if they want to and
[46:06] declare what they want to out of it to
[46:07] be good or bad right i'm just making it
[46:10] plain as i can make it
[46:16] i don't understand the seals you ever
[46:18] read the book
[46:20] no i i just never have felt like i could
[46:22] read it i'm waiting on somebody to
[46:26] oh
[46:29] see you
[46:30] prove what you're doing
[46:32] you're waiting on somebody
[46:35] to do something
[46:38] well
[46:43] the church listen to what i'm talking
[46:44] about
[46:46] we say we can't understand brother
[46:47] brown's message
[46:49] if we understood the bible we could
[46:55] and he spent 30 40 years preaching
[46:57] straight out of the scriptures to get us
[46:59] to understand the bible
[47:02] then the seals broke then the things
[47:04] began to unveil
[47:13] you see
[47:15] what are we waiting on
[47:17] at least let's declare it as here and
[47:20] begin to move into it that god can do it
[47:23] come on how many times you want me to
[47:24] say it you can't be healed unless you
[47:27] faith say you're healed you can't be
[47:29] saved unless you first say you're saved
[47:34] you've got to confess it
[47:38] well then there's no way if you'd
[47:39] understand the seals if you ain't never
[47:40] read the book
[47:42] now that's something
[47:44] well i'm afraid i might get confused now
[47:47] glory
[47:48] you're afraid you're gonna get confused
[47:50] honey you already confused
[47:53] we was born confused
[47:57] the only thing that'll take us out of
[47:59] the confusion is this message
[48:06] now let me put it this way this message
[48:08] revealed
[48:12] i made a statement the other day about
[48:13] it and people just look at you and say i
[48:15] have never went to a service and sat
[48:17] down and listened to anyone that i
[48:19] didn't get something from it
[48:24] i don't care whether i believe what the
[48:26] pro the man was saying or not
[48:29] i'm gonna get something because my heart
[48:31] is hungry
[48:34] there's a desire in my heart to
[48:36] understand
[48:39] well i ain't going to listen brother
[48:40] so-and-so he's already confused now
[48:42] you're just as confused as he is if you
[48:44] if you're afraid of the fact of
[48:45] listening to him
[48:48] you're afraid
[48:52] me and brother mo we just get kind of
[48:54] tickled at each other because you know
[48:55] somebody come along and say with a
[48:56] brother so-and-so over here but he's off
[48:58] the message we'd both look at each other
[49:00] so what we're going to be doing this
[49:02] weekend
[49:03] that's four we started pastoring and
[49:06] running a church
[49:10] we we looked at each other and just you
[49:12] know
[49:13] because he knew what i was doing and i
[49:14] knew what he was doing we're going to be
[49:16] setting in that church
[49:19] because we wasn't going to be taking
[49:21] what everybody else said
[49:24] we were going to go here for herself and
[49:27] you know what we found out a lot of
[49:28] times that the ones that have said they
[49:31] were off would want more off than the
[49:33] ones that we went to here
[49:39] of course you don't want people don't
[49:40] want that
[49:43] but come on church
[49:48] this is the age that is predestinated
[49:50] unto adoption
[49:56] this is our destiny
[49:58] that was the life's message right
[50:01] this is our destiny our
[50:03] it's determined
[50:05] that a word is going to be here in the
[50:07] end time a seed word
[50:12] what did brother ronald say that the
[50:14] bride is to be delivered
[50:16] of a new birth from according to malachi
[50:18] 4.
[50:20] oh
[50:22] well i didn't know he said that well go
[50:24] read the book get your computer and look
[50:27] it up
[50:28] i ain't got time
[50:31] that's what a brother moat said one day
[50:33] he said something about stature of a
[50:34] prairie man he said this brother he's
[50:37] talking to and the brother said
[50:39] i just ain't got time brother said well
[50:41] i only preached about 60-something
[50:43] sermons
[50:44] and he looked at him he said i ain't got
[50:46] time to listen to all them sermons he
[50:47] said york too you ain't got nothing yet
[50:52] that's what he said back to you ain't
[50:54] got nothing yet
[50:56] you ought to have time to go listen
[50:59] well i didn't think he was being
[51:00] sarcastic
[51:02] i didn't think he was being hateful a
[51:04] smart aleck or whatever i think the
[51:06] other guy was being the smart athlete
[51:08] because the other guy was saying we
[51:09] don't understand
[51:14] we just believe we we we're
[51:17] we're waiting on something okay
[51:21] what is my way of saying waiting on
[51:23] somebody
[51:24] whether you're waiting on brother
[51:26] branham to return or whether you're
[51:27] waiting on whatever
[51:29] what is my way of explaining that
[51:32] you can't
[51:34] it don't do you no good to wait at the
[51:37] bus depot
[51:39] for the airplane to come along
[51:42] what are you saying at least get into
[51:45] our port
[51:48] at least get in the message
[51:51] and read it and study it
[52:03] unto adoption is the subtitle part that
[52:06] we've been we're covering today
[52:08] unto what the prophet say unto unto the
[52:10] water fountain going through the door
[52:12] unto it means something that you're in a
[52:14] travel journey of doing
[52:16] unto
[52:18] all right what have we been in all of
[52:19] these years
[52:23] i'm doing all these years
[52:25] what have we been in all these years
[52:30] because of brother dale you're just an
[52:32] intellect
[52:33] well you know i from my understanding of
[52:36] the word intellect
[52:38] it doesn't necessarily have to be smart
[52:43] you know it just means that you have the
[52:46] ability well you know what i've always
[52:48] tried to explain on that i might not be
[52:50] smart enough to tell you something
[52:53] but i am smart enough to find out where
[52:56] it's in the book
[52:59] right does that hurt your feelings yeah
[53:02] it hurts your feelings you don't like it
[53:04] because you ain't going to get into
[53:05] books and study you're going to read
[53:07] with all these other things
[53:09] won't you do like my brother's a
[53:10] methodist minister why don't you get you
[53:12] a playboy magazine rack put it in your
[53:14] house where you can read them
[53:16] instead of studying the message
[53:20] you send me no brother yeah my brother's
[53:23] got that
[53:26] but i've heard him preach messages that
[53:27] will make the most of the ministry of
[53:29] this message ashamed of his direction
[53:31] and his point of what he's trying to
[53:32] bring
[53:38] you mean you'd go listen to it yeah
[53:41] like i said
[53:42] he can out preach a lot of the preachers
[53:44] in his message
[53:46] now don't back up
[53:49] i ain't over there today it's just up
[53:51] the road up here
[53:54] but listen church what am i trying to
[53:56] get
[53:57] unto adoption this is the age get this
[54:01] one thing of nothing else out of the
[54:03] message
[54:04] this is an age that ever ever age there
[54:06] were seven church ages right
[54:09] each church age had a word to be brought
[54:11] forth for that age
[54:13] all right
[54:14] see that means we've got the word to be
[54:16] brought forth what to be delivered of a
[54:17] new birth from according to malachi 4.
[54:21] right
[54:23] i mean that's one of the things that
[54:24] just thought but i'm getting you to a
[54:26] point of thinking about what i'm talking
[54:28] about
[54:28] this is the age
[54:30] that the adoption is to come point to
[54:33] where that we're not just being babies
[54:36] playing around we're not just saying i'm
[54:38] born again i'm in the family glory
[54:41] hallelujah i'm i'm in the family i've
[54:44] been in the family i've been born again
[54:45] 40 years i've been praise god
[54:51] but what about your inheritance
[54:58] the way your prophet was explaining it
[55:00] if you want to go through it
[55:03] that's just an
[55:04] earnest for us to have the understanding
[55:07] of the bible of the apostles and the
[55:09] thing that's an earnest
[55:12] of the finality that the prophet brought
[55:16] an earnest
[55:17] a part payment
[55:21] those pentecostals had the new birth he
[55:24] never denied that you can't do that you
[55:26] can't do it like i said that brother
[55:27] standing here and he was down there a
[55:28] little at the gills with and said them
[55:30] pentecost didn't have nothing i told him
[55:32] i said according to the prophet they had
[55:33] the new birth
[55:37] well that didn't change him he come
[55:39] right here and preached it that night
[55:40] and said
[55:42] pentecostals was
[55:45] didn't have
[55:46] nothing brother branham you show me one
[55:49] place where brother run them ever said
[55:50] the pentecostal didn't have nothing i'll
[55:52] show you a whole lot of message where he
[55:55] said them people had to do the street
[55:58] was the genuine baptism of the holy
[56:01] ghost
[56:02] the new birth into the body of jesus
[56:05] christ
[56:07] right
[56:08] that's why people ain't going to say
[56:09] nothing to me about it because they know
[56:10] it that's why i don't get it back off
[56:11] the internet
[56:12] because they know what at least what i
[56:14] said is right
[56:17] but i'm not doing it to try to be smart
[56:18] i'm doing it to try to get me and you to
[56:20] wake up
[56:24] oh you're just being nasty you been
[56:25] there
[56:26] no
[56:28] i was praying yesterday and
[56:30] today especially
[56:34] and the lord showed me something and i
[56:36] said
[56:37] lord
[56:40] i ain't gonna try to explain that i
[56:42] already have and it went wrong trying to
[56:44] explain it
[56:46] i've tried to explain
[56:49] that the biggest portion of people would
[56:50] die and go by the grave
[56:52] genuine born again
[56:57] children of god
[57:03] i've never said nobody wouldn't
[57:07] right because they didn't agree with me
[57:09] or my thoughts or ideas i'm just asking
[57:12] you to consider that
[57:15] it was said 40 years ago
[57:18] if we don't get out here pretty quick
[57:19] we're going to have to be doing to the
[57:21] nursing home
[57:24] and i'm not a joking
[57:29] i mean you think you're going to live a
[57:30] long time
[57:36] brother dale he talks like that he just
[57:38] expected to die no i ain't expecting to
[57:40] die that's one thing that i ain't
[57:42] expecting to do i may be in the nursing
[57:44] home i may be in a lot of things but i'm
[57:46] not expecting to die
[57:49] i've fought for
[57:50] 50 years
[57:53] this coming
[57:54] fourth of july
[57:58] will be 50 years
[58:00] this church has been in operation
[58:03] odd that it's fallen on the 4th of july
[58:06] that we started on the fourth of july
[58:10] on a sunday
[58:12] it's come back now
[58:14] until that fourth of july this coming is
[58:16] going to be our 50th
[58:20] that's a jubilee
[58:25] that's a jubilee
[58:27] that's a joyous time a joyous festivity
[58:34] what do you think about it
[58:39] see i know for sure that we're doing one
[58:41] thing for certain we're going to up or
[58:42] down one pretty quick right we're too
[58:45] old come on
[58:47] come on don't play
[58:48] i'm not playing games to try to throw
[58:50] stones at anybody whatever a lot of the
[58:53] people that's in this building is over
[58:54] 50 years old
[58:58] and it's kind of like we're talking
[58:59] about outside out there
[59:01] you know we used to when we had a car
[59:03] you know we used to buy a brand new car
[59:05] and we'd drive at 40 000 miles and we
[59:08] started getting ready to trade it in
[59:11] right
[59:14] am i right
[59:15] we started getting ready to get rid of
[59:17] that thing because it was wore out
[59:21] right
[59:23] but you know somebody just happened to
[59:25] push the foot feed
[59:27] and this price that 40 50 000 mile
[59:29] bracket and it just went on and they got
[59:31] to a hundred thousand mile now they got
[59:33] the two hundred thousand mile another
[59:35] 300 400
[59:38] there's people driving cars around it's
[59:39] got 500 000 miles on them
[59:46] well
[59:47] well it's gonna quit one of these days
[59:50] well so what
[59:54] are you gonna quit
[59:58] no i'm gonna fight it out as much as i
[1:00:00] can
[1:00:00] and stay with it as much as long as i
[1:00:02] can
[1:00:04] and i ain't going to worry about the
[1:00:05] rest
[1:00:07] but in my fight now there's one thing
[1:00:09] for certain i'm going to try my best to
[1:00:11] get me and you to realize where we're at
[1:00:15] right here
[1:00:18] at the end time
[1:00:19] [Applause]
[1:00:23] right
[1:00:25] all of these things coming upon us
[1:00:28] but yet if we've been in
[1:00:31] enough to understand
[1:00:34] you know to most of the people all of
[1:00:35] these plagues that have come upon us
[1:00:37] it's done put us in the tribulation
[1:00:39] period well that ain't so that's right
[1:00:42] i don't care who teaches it
[1:00:45] it's not so
[1:00:49] why because tribulation is the wrath of
[1:00:52] god poured out we're not under any form
[1:00:54] of tribulation that the wrath of god is
[1:00:56] poured out we're under tribulation of
[1:00:58] tribulation that worketh patience are a
[1:01:01] pre-tribulation the prophet covered it
[1:01:03] in the seal book
[1:01:07] we're not in the basis of a wrath of god
[1:01:10] in the wrath of god means there is no
[1:01:12] mercy
[1:01:16] i'm going to ask you but how many of you
[1:01:18] took an aspirin or pain field today
[1:01:20] a lot of you did
[1:01:22] ain't no gun against it i'm not talking
[1:01:24] about that i'm talking about one thing
[1:01:25] what about when it comes a time when you
[1:01:27] can just down a whole bottle of pain
[1:01:29] pills and it won't stop no pain
[1:01:32] what about a time coming the bible
[1:01:34] speaks of it to where the
[1:01:36] animals or birds and things are just eat
[1:01:38] your flesh off of you
[1:01:40] while you're still alive
[1:01:43] and they ain't nothing you can pray to
[1:01:47] the only thing you can find them praying
[1:01:49] there is praying that the rocks and
[1:01:50] things fall upon them and hide them from
[1:01:52] the wrath of god
[1:01:54] that's the only praying that can be done
[1:01:59] but you see then i'm not worried about
[1:02:01] that part i'm just trying to get you to
[1:02:03] get away from thinking about those silly
[1:02:04] like things and get down to the bases of
[1:02:06] where to know to realize where we are
[1:02:08] and what we're doing
[1:02:12] come on i don't mind you saying it
[1:02:13] because i know what people say well
[1:02:15] we've heard this before
[1:02:18] yep and if you come next time i preach
[1:02:21] you'll hear it again
[1:02:27] because i believe it's the truth
[1:02:30] i believe we're in the end time
[1:02:33] how much longer of time wise we got that
[1:02:35] ain't got nothing to do with it ain't
[1:02:36] never had nothing to do with it
[1:02:39] but yet i have to admit one thing
[1:02:42] that still lays there that you can't
[1:02:43] argue about in 1974
[1:02:46] i proved by the prophet's message in the
[1:02:48] bible we could pass the year 2026
[1:02:51] and not break the message nor the
[1:02:53] prophet's message no way
[1:02:56] but how many people wants to look at
[1:02:58] that oh they had dates of 77 73 and a
[1:03:01] half and all like 80s and 88s and all
[1:03:05] all right
[1:03:07] i didn't try to get that to be anything
[1:03:09] to say that we could do it i was wanting
[1:03:10] the lord to come i want him to come
[1:03:12] right now
[1:03:13] i don't want him to wait until 78
[1:03:16] 2026.
[1:03:19] but i just proved the point
[1:03:23] that we were spending our time trying to
[1:03:25] run about of this that or the other and
[1:03:27] god had already shown where he could
[1:03:29] where it could go to
[1:03:33] your prophet stand there and he'd say
[1:03:34] like this he said it could be two or
[1:03:36] three years
[1:03:37] one time he said more than one i guess
[1:03:39] but i know one time he said i said it
[1:03:41] could be a hundred years
[1:03:43] and that was probably somewhere around
[1:03:45] 1960.
[1:03:48] he said it could be a hundred years
[1:03:51] i'm not concerned about that
[1:03:53] what i'm concerned with is what about me
[1:03:55] and you
[1:03:58] but yet we know everything else
[1:04:04] it's never been an age like this age
[1:04:06] when the internet just runs everything
[1:04:11] they don't have to have a mark of the
[1:04:12] beast you got it
[1:04:19] you've got it in your pocket where you
[1:04:21] right now called a telephone
[1:04:23] [Music]
[1:04:24] that they can handle you anytime they
[1:04:26] want to
[1:04:27] they can call you anytime they want to
[1:04:30] and they can
[1:04:31] pick you up anytime they want to
[1:04:34] right where you're sitting they can drop
[1:04:36] right out here and walk in and say we
[1:04:37] want you
[1:04:38] we want you
[1:04:45] i don't i'm not afraid of that
[1:04:50] i've never been afraid of being so that
[1:04:53] they could come in and get us and
[1:04:54] everything that's not that's not the
[1:04:56] fear of a christian the fear of a
[1:04:58] christian and god am i serving you right
[1:05:03] lord am i serving you
[1:05:05] am i following you no matter what
[1:05:07] everybody else says
[1:05:14] but what about it
[1:05:20] unto adoption
[1:05:24] this age is going to come to the
[1:05:27] adoption
[1:05:29] that has never been there
[1:05:31] now that's what i'm talking about
[1:05:33] there's never been a people that was
[1:05:36] fully manifesting adoption
[1:05:39] the only let me say this well people
[1:05:41] jesus raised from the dead
[1:05:44] he raised
[1:05:46] a natural body into a glorified
[1:05:48] condition right but ain't nobody else
[1:05:51] been able to reach immortality that's
[1:05:53] what the bible says
[1:05:55] but him
[1:05:57] but you know what if we can get him here
[1:06:00] enough in you and i
[1:06:02] then
[1:06:03] mortal can be turned to immortality
[1:06:10] right
[1:06:13] then you don't have to worry about it
[1:06:19] i gave you most of these anybody that
[1:06:20] wants them here welcome to it
[1:06:23] your adoption is not
[1:06:26] your new birth
[1:06:31] you get the new birth by the baptism of
[1:06:32] the holy ghost
[1:06:34] and you grow into adoption
[1:06:40] your adoption is your
[1:06:43] placing
[1:06:46] putting you into family
[1:06:52] adoption is not your
[1:06:55] birth your adoption is your placing
[1:07:00] let's see if i can find that because i
[1:07:01] mentioned it the other day and i noticed
[1:07:03] it when i flopped over you know what
[1:07:04] brother branham says that that god even
[1:07:07] put it there
[1:07:08] in the holy ghost speaking and said i
[1:07:10] killed the people
[1:07:23] the same son that was born into the
[1:07:25] family
[1:07:26] had to be placed in the family
[1:07:29] or had to be the law of adoption as paul
[1:07:31] speaking of ephesians 1 5 predestinated
[1:07:35] to be the adoption of children by jesus
[1:07:38] christ
[1:07:40] the same thing that happened to jesus
[1:07:42] christ on the mount of transfiguration
[1:07:44] when he said this is my beloved son hear
[1:07:46] ye him
[1:07:47] see
[1:07:49] the pentecostals
[1:07:51] found the new birth
[1:07:55] but it didn't go on
[1:08:02] the church ought to be in adoption right
[1:08:04] now
[1:08:06] now bring it into the full favors of god
[1:08:11] we're up and ups we're ups and downs
[1:08:16] ins and outs and ups and downs and ins
[1:08:19] and out until god can't trust us with
[1:08:22] nothing
[1:08:28] am i reading it
[1:08:30] pentecostals
[1:08:32] missed
[1:08:35] because you're to remind you were a son
[1:08:37] when you was born into the family but
[1:08:39] yet they missed the adoption i'm reading
[1:08:42] these scanning off some of you have
[1:08:43] these you can have them
[1:08:48] what about it
[1:08:49] god has predestinated us unto adoption
[1:08:53] of sons
[1:08:59] if that son never did come to be the
[1:09:02] right kind of a son
[1:09:04] he never became come heir
[1:09:07] but he was the right but if he was the
[1:09:09] right son
[1:09:10] and the son that would obey his father
[1:09:12] then
[1:09:14] he become heirs
[1:09:18] he was adopted like jesus on mount of
[1:09:21] transfiguration
[1:09:27] just looking at a few things
[1:09:32] welcome for all of these
[1:09:35] i give them to you
[1:09:37] he says you're predestinated unto
[1:09:38] adoption before the foundation of the
[1:09:40] world
[1:09:45] you're predestinated unto adoption
[1:09:47] before the foundation of the world
[1:09:51] before the world ever begun
[1:09:54] so what are we worried about why don't
[1:09:55] we get into studying the message
[1:09:58] but he says you only have the earnest
[1:10:00] now notice we're predestinated with the
[1:10:02] lamb the holy spirit is our seal the
[1:10:05] earnest means more is yet to come
[1:10:09] we only have the earnest of it now the
[1:10:11] earnest is just the down payment
[1:10:14] so no one else can touch it it's the
[1:10:17] earnest of our adoption the holy spirit
[1:10:20] is now the earnest of god in our hearts
[1:10:22] sealed the adoption of sons waiting us
[1:10:25] at the end of the road sons and
[1:10:28] daughters of god
[1:10:32] waiting
[1:10:33] for the redemption of our body
[1:10:39] we have the earnest that god is with us
[1:10:42] we have the earnest that god has not
[1:10:44] forsaken us
[1:10:46] that we are his and he is ours because
[1:10:48] we in our bodies
[1:10:50] we now tabernacle the holy spirit of god
[1:10:53] that cries
[1:10:54] out abba father and there's nothing can
[1:10:57] ever take that away
[1:10:59] we are anchored in christ
[1:11:04] now i'm looking at something that can't
[1:11:06] be taken away
[1:11:08] my eternal life cannot be removed
[1:11:12] my position of coming to adoption cannot
[1:11:15] be removed by no devil or anybody you
[1:11:18] think i'm afraid of any of those things
[1:11:21] we're waiting for the fullness of
[1:11:23] adoption
[1:11:24] this will take place when at the first
[1:11:27] resurrection
[1:11:31] it's going to take place at the first
[1:11:33] resurrection
[1:11:37] he made man that little god he made man
[1:11:40] a god a god in his domain
[1:11:44] the world is waiting for the
[1:11:45] manifestation that's from the true sons
[1:11:47] of god
[1:11:48] field sons speak the word and see it
[1:11:51] create
[1:11:56] god's waiting god's wanting to place his
[1:11:58] church sons and daughters of god
[1:12:01] i like that because
[1:12:03] see i said something there the other day
[1:12:05] and i said well i hope it don't hurt
[1:12:06] your feelings sisters because
[1:12:08] it is not covered in the bible of
[1:12:10] adoption of daughters
[1:12:12] it's only covered in the bible form of
[1:12:14] adoption of sons
[1:12:17] but yet your prophet knew when it turned
[1:12:18] into a new testament dispensation that's
[1:12:20] why he could say that
[1:12:23] sons and daughters
[1:12:25] he puts you right back in right where
[1:12:27] you're supposed to be sons and daughters
[1:12:29] of god not just sons of god
[1:12:32] well we're the sons of god boy yeah
[1:12:34] that's what you're you're doing
[1:12:37] you think cancer or something
[1:12:42] the bible says there's coming a time
[1:12:45] when men will rot right in their flesh
[1:12:49] and the buzzards will eat off of the
[1:12:51] carcasses before
[1:12:52] they even die
[1:12:54] cancer is a toothache to what's coming
[1:12:57] but remember
[1:12:59] that horrible thing was forbidden in
[1:13:01] that day to touch those who had the seal
[1:13:04] of god
[1:13:10] i'm going to
[1:13:12] end with this last little poem
[1:13:16] you know some say well this viruses that
[1:13:18] we've just had and all of these things
[1:13:22] that so-and-so teaches that nobody's
[1:13:24] supposed to get it
[1:13:26] if their bride
[1:13:30] if you were under the persecution of the
[1:13:32] tribulation of god's wrath being poured
[1:13:34] out i would agree with you
[1:13:37] you see why did i don't agree with that
[1:13:40] you see why did i stand where i stand
[1:13:43] that we are not under the tribulation
[1:13:46] or the wrath of god that is poured out
[1:13:51] we are under the
[1:13:53] tribulation that work with patience
[1:13:56] we're under the pre-tribulation time
[1:13:58] we're not under the tribulation of god's
[1:14:01] wrath poured out because there's no
[1:14:02] mercy for that
[1:14:06] that's why just you why don't you go
[1:14:07] back to the message when somebody makes
[1:14:09] a statement well brother so-and-so said
[1:14:11] it
[1:14:16] am i right
[1:14:18] did it enter into any of your thoughts
[1:14:20] or anything as you go forth it's saying
[1:14:22] well brother so-and-so said that uh
[1:14:26] we weren't supposed to get none of these
[1:14:27] things
[1:14:32] well i've had people to tell me that
[1:14:33] back in the 70s that we weren't supposed
[1:14:35] to get sick and i said well you know
[1:14:36] it's kind of odd that the lord jesus got
[1:14:38] sick
[1:14:40] i said i just i just don't understand
[1:14:42] that
[1:14:46] but you see church i've tried to study
[1:14:48] the message to be able to have the
[1:14:50] answers
[1:14:51] to you that would have the questions
[1:14:54] and not just how well we don't know
[1:14:57] we're just we're doing the best we can
[1:14:59] do brother dale why you want us to do
[1:15:05] i want you to read and study
[1:15:08] i want you to be ready i want you to be
[1:15:09] ready because you read and studied i
[1:15:11] want you to know the word of god i want
[1:15:13] you to know what the prophet is taught i
[1:15:15] want us all to know where and to see
[1:15:17] what to expect or what to take place
[1:15:27] but you see
[1:15:29] back there the 40s
[1:15:31] your prophet was bringing the truth
[1:15:34] he hit the 50s it started
[1:15:36] increasing it hit the 60s he started
[1:15:39] increasing
[1:15:40] 70s
[1:15:45] now there's where you think when it
[1:15:46] ended with the prophet when he went off
[1:15:48] the scene in the 60s
[1:15:50] no
[1:15:53] it just got started
[1:15:57] it's just starting now
[1:15:59] to those who can recognize who they are
[1:16:01] and what they're doing
[1:16:05] and i'd like to see something
[1:16:07] well
[1:16:08] why don't you start practicing
[1:16:11] right
[1:16:12] right
[1:16:14] why don't you start practicing
[1:16:18] why don't you start calling on god
[1:16:24] it's not meant for all of us to call on
[1:16:25] god it's meant for you to call on god
[1:16:26] for what you have neato
[1:16:29] then we call we help we pray god sure
[1:16:37] what you see we can't even understand it
[1:16:39] was listen one night's not where brother
[1:16:41] random was talking and he said um
[1:16:46] something about you know
[1:16:48] have you been to the doctor
[1:16:51] well see here's a
[1:16:52] a
[1:16:53] prophet asking you have you been to the
[1:16:55] doctor and says
[1:16:58] you don't have no right to go before god
[1:17:00] if you don't go to the doctor first
[1:17:05] oh
[1:17:09] now it seems like he's really putting it
[1:17:11] back in the doctor
[1:17:13] i believe he's just trying to put it in
[1:17:15] our faith
[1:17:17] because we don't have enough faith
[1:17:21] i'm just as plain as language can be if
[1:17:23] you don't have enough faith for it to
[1:17:25] work then the best thing to do is go to
[1:17:26] doctrine
[1:17:29] i mean if you're sick and you're feeling
[1:17:30] bad the best thing to do is go doctor
[1:17:34] all right that should be your first time
[1:17:36] well i ain't depending on no doctrine
[1:17:38] depending on god well i think that's why
[1:17:40] the prophet put it that way
[1:17:47] feller a woman one asked him about a
[1:17:49] thing and he said
[1:17:51] one day and he said it like this i can't
[1:17:52] remember exactly but it's pretty close
[1:17:55] but he said
[1:17:56] it was a stomach problem he said won't
[1:17:58] you go down here on the corner so
[1:18:00] there's a doctor down there that
[1:18:02] specializes in
[1:18:04] them stomach operation
[1:18:08] why didn't your prophets pick it right
[1:18:10] there
[1:18:13] well you know what god don't do
[1:18:15] everything we think he ought to do
[1:18:21] sometimes it might be putting us to the
[1:18:23] test come on you position
[1:18:25] sometimes it might be putting us to a
[1:18:27] test
[1:18:28] but do you see the day that we're living
[1:18:30] i want to get that part in there because
[1:18:33] it just keeps coming back coming back
[1:18:34] the day that we're living or time
[1:18:37] then we can move on into some things the
[1:18:39] prophet has taught right
[1:18:45] we can get into a fivefold ministry that
[1:18:48] is
[1:18:48] an office
[1:18:55] now five fold
[1:18:57] well brother branham said it
[1:19:00] i don't mind it if i say it with him do
[1:19:02] you
[1:19:06] he says there's a nine gifts that's in
[1:19:09] the body he said
[1:19:11] you can have one of them and lose it
[1:19:12] they can go back and forth you can use
[1:19:14] this one time but he said there's five
[1:19:17] ministries
[1:19:19] that are
[1:19:20] offices that are predestinated
[1:19:28] but do we believe that
[1:19:31] because may i quote the rest of what
[1:19:32] he's saying he says our problem is we
[1:19:35] don't
[1:19:36] trust
[1:19:38] the people
[1:19:40] that are praying for us
[1:19:46] it's kind of like somebody told one time
[1:19:47] said that they they prayed for this lady
[1:19:50] or something said dad wants to come back
[1:19:51] over a man or somebody watch it come
[1:19:53] back over here
[1:19:55] do you believe god heard you
[1:19:58] well
[1:20:00] maybe that's the way it is
[1:20:03] but we need to have confidence
[1:20:06] in our brothers and sisters when we ask
[1:20:07] for prayer we need to have confidence
[1:20:10] that god will hear us
[1:20:17] that may be your pointless stance
[1:20:19] what we got brother
[1:20:22] yeah i like that song she sang later
[1:20:23] this morning
[1:20:24] that was good
[1:20:26] keep singing
[1:20:28] from bethlehem
[1:20:30] [Music]
[1:20:34] came
[1:20:35] forth a stranger
[1:20:39] on earth
[1:20:42] [Music]
[1:20:55] you love me
[1:20:58] [Music]
[1:21:09] step out
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:24] down into a body
[1:21:28] and became god
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:32] manifest
[1:21:35] upon the earth
[1:21:38] see what he wants me and you to do is
[1:21:40] step out
[1:21:42] and let him do that again
[1:21:44] but in us
[1:21:46] [Applause]
[1:21:48] he won't actually believe it
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:55] we know our brother's having some
[1:21:56] problems and let's just believe with him
[1:21:59] because
[1:22:02] god's word is true
[1:22:05] we've seen so many things happen with a
[1:22:07] prayer cloth
[1:22:09] just give somebody a prayer claw and say
[1:22:11] just take this
[1:22:14] just pin it to the head of your bed
[1:22:15] because you're going to be there most of
[1:22:17] the time
[1:22:19] go back and talk to danny about
[1:22:22] one time he was in the hospital and
[1:22:25] we took him a prayer claw got one to him
[1:22:27] somewhere i forgot even how it happened
[1:22:29] but
[1:22:31] he still got that prayer cloth
[1:22:33] underneath his watch
[1:22:36] the band of his watch
[1:22:40] well
[1:22:42] that's something good to do
[1:22:44] i got him in my billfold
[1:22:47] i've never been broke
[1:22:50] [Music]
[1:22:53] i got them in my billfold i keep them
[1:22:55] there
[1:22:56] always teach the kids hey put back some
[1:22:58] money in what we call the rat hole you
[1:23:00] know just a place to put it
[1:23:02] and keep it there
[1:23:06] a prayer cloth
[1:23:07] with what money you got and see how it
[1:23:09] works
[1:23:13] put everything in him
[1:23:16] and believe it
[1:23:18] father
[1:23:20] we know our brother has a problem
[1:23:22] he's facing a lot of troubles and
[1:23:24] if you don't step on the scene then he's
[1:23:27] not going to be able to work and things
[1:23:31] but we believe you
[1:23:32] and we thank you
[1:23:34] that by your stripes he's healed
[1:23:38] and we commit everything to you lord
[1:23:41] we go forth now confessing
