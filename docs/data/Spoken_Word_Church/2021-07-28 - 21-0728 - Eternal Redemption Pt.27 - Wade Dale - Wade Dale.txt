carolina i talked to brother joe green yesterday and they're not going to have any as far as he knows any foreign brothers brother donnie reagan and brother ron spencer will be doing the services at the church it will not be at the school it will be at the church all right so just remember that and also i want to thank all the ladies and the men and everybody that had something to do yesterday with sister maggie's funeral it was beautiful and well done and um had plenty of food and sister gwen and brother joe really did appreciate it so just keep praying for the family for the loss of loved one and also amy and jeffrey and the and the different ones pray for them um brother luis you'll be preaching august the 11th i want to go ahead and get that get that out of the way also uh we really thank everybody for participating in the youth service this past saturday brother richard hyatt did a good job he really felt uh at home with all of us so he's a real good brother and uh just pray for their church up there in in russellville kentucky all right also we're going to this sunday we're going to have communion and foot washing we talked about that okay we i know we talked about it before but we're going to go ahead and start having foot washing again so we'll have communion and foot washing this coming sunday everybody with me okay community foot washing this coming sunday good to get back to that that's one ordinance we have not done for a while so we'll get back to it so the lord bless you if you would turn to hebrews 9. we'll continue with the plan of eternal redemption we will get to the two prophets today brother donnie for sure because i cut out a lot i hate deleting quotes i just i don't like doing that i like deleting quotes but i had to delete some to get to get to where we're going so hebrews9 and and and really you know and when we look at this plan of redemption from here forward when we leave in revelations 4 1 when the bride leaves you know i want y'all to understand something and you know that but some of the new ones don't there's a difference between the bride and the church the bride is a chosen vessel the bride is his sons and daughters the church is a is the church nominal or you call a remnant if you wish they're the ones that come part the way in but don't come all the way in they're taught you know like you know you heard brother branham they're teaching on baptism of holy ghost justification sanctification and then the baptism of the holy ghost puts you in the body of christ a lot of people are just taught that they need to shake a hand uh try to turn over a new leaf and then they get told all these life things that they need to do you know it's kind of like a kind of like a a chicken soup for the soul you know that i don't think chicken soup got anything to do with the soul right that doesn't feed me i want something to feed my soul the word of god feeds my soul the correct word of god now you can have the word of god but the correct word of god is what feeds your soul so tonight as we look even in book of revelations we see that because of the mystery that we have that's unfolded to me and you in the end time we can understand and see the bride and we can see the church all right and you've got to separate them if you don't like brother brown said that one man said well brother brown said it looks like the bride's up in heaven the bride's on earth the bride's over here he said you just don't have the bride down right you got to have the bride down right because the bride remember is a secret catching away the bride is all has been in the lounge book of life before the foundation of the world never to be erased in any shape or form or fashion that genesis 1 26 ma'am amen then you have a foolish virgin that comes part of the way and then you have the ones of the cup of water in my name and all those different things and they're the ones that are left for the tribulation period and we'll get into that in just a minute so let's buy our heads before we get started i think we got everything covered sure enough pray for sister gwen brother joe they really for 13 years she she harbored you know i mean she stayed there with that with her mom and now her mom's gone so uh let's just keep him in prayers dear heavenly father we thank you for this day that you give us this night in the middle of the week that we can just rejuvenate ourselves a little bit from all the carers of the world and just for a little while sit back and lord talk about you father we pray there should be ones that are sick the ones that the the ones that came in the real serious one there brother yancey's or sister ladonna we pray that you would just go to her right now lord and take that away from her lord and maybe may she be off that ventilator and lord she'll give you another testimony as just said that she was a real faith based lady believer so lord i pray that you'd touch her lord she stood for you now please lord stand for her we pray that you should be your brother tom earnest and all the different ones lord brother jewel called yesterday he's out of the hospital so he's doing better but we pray that you just continue to bless him and be with him be with a little bride around the world lord be with the ones even in our congregation lord that are not here tonight we pray that you touch them father in their body and give them something spiritually lord as they go through their journey we ask these things in jesus name amen brother jewell is out of the hospital i meant to mention and he's he's going through some more speech therapy because his speech is a little bit slurred from the mini stroke that he had but they haven't they're working on his he got two valves that are leaking in his heart and there's blood in his heart so you have to just be careful with that and they're trying to do it put the pacemaker in so hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming high priests of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us and that's what we've been on for 27 sermons here now amos 3 7 surely the lord god will do nothing he's not going to do anything but what he reveals is to the to the prophets first because the prophet is the mouthpiece of god now we know there are false prophets but you've got to discern the right and the wrong amen the line hath roared who will not fear the lord god hath spoken who can but prophesy then revelations 11 3 and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy 1 203 score days that's 1260 days clothed in sackcloth you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word and because that 1260 days see that's where it took another prophet because man has wondered what in the world is 1260 days because it doesn't coincide with our 365 days of the year but but the prophet of god being a prophet god spoke to him and said that's a prophetic calendar before the flood before the answer to the luvian flood that the world was standing upright and there was 360 days it wobbles now so there's 365 in a fourth day but under regular time it was 360 days all right and remember that when we go into the millennium it's going to be 360 days it's going to be a thousand years not like our calendar years all right so in hebrews 9 11 he obtained eternal redemption let's go to revelations 1 verse 20 just the background just a moment because there had to be seven stars and we know the seven stars are the angels of the church seven churches so there were seven angels or messengers from god we saw that last week which they saw us are the seven churches so there's seven stars seven angels that are going to be sent to a group of people to create i said create the body of christ because that's what he's doing you create they become a new creation so they created the body of christ out of denomination and out of all the different things there's a bride being called out in every age not being in an age but they're called out of the age because the age if you read in revelations we read it in revelations one you see there's good stuff and there's bad stuff to each one of these church ages there's good and bad good and bad good and bad but when you come to the last church age none of it's good it's all bad why because we've we have actually put god outside the door he's the only church ages where he's knocking is trying to get back in his own church get back in his own building that's why i said you got to know there's a bride because the bride didn't push him out the church pushed him out all right so he's knocking on the church door knock the bride door because the bride has always been inside with god in the holy of holies everybody got that amen so now we see that we needed a prophet to come matthew 17 verse 10 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that he lies must first come and jesus answered and said unto them he lies truly shall first come and what restore all things in other words like we were talking about the the court of the gospel of jesus christ was perfect it was eternal it was complete and then man got involved and started taking the scissors of their own ideas and started cutting this one out and cutting that one out and turning the page where it says acts 2 38 and and not matthew 28 19 which is we know it's saying the exact same thing but man didn't know that man's ideas put him totally separate and what created denominations you look now you uh we saw dad's brother yesterday that was a methodist preacher and i was going to try to ask him what are they going to do when they they're going to have their vote here i think next year or the end of this year whether to allow homosexuals to be preachers and that they say it's going to actually create another methodist church you can't create another denomination they're good grief they've got enough of them already but what is it going to do their ideas are going to split them there'll be a new methodist church and there'll be an old methodist church the old methodist church is going to not let the homosexuals preaching the pulpit and the new ones the new thinkers are going to allow that to happen all right well we know nothing against those kind of people the bible condemns them i don't have to amen the bible condemns unclean living i don't have to do that all right i'll shake their hand and say god bless you but i'm not going to enter into their junk or let them be able to do anything like the methodist church wants to allow them into fellowship but what is it going to do so what's my point my point is somewhere down the line that happened in another denomination and another doctrine like dad's always said the baptist church was the baptist church and then they split because one said predestination was this and one said predestination was that just off of one little thing you've now got free will baptist and first baptist and third baptist and 10th baptist and you got all these progressive and then you got the ones that are contemporary and you see what i mean god can't be that confused folks so god had to send a prophet to bring it all back together and listen he didn't just bring him he bring he brought him here under vindication and like i said before whatever you want to think about his life god spoke to me through that man amen god spoke to me through that man you're gonna have to decide where they spoke to you through that man amen and he helped me put the word together and he's waiting on us to fulfill what he's already said because you know what sometimes we might have loose ends because we don't have the full revelation yet but when he opened when those seals became open then he said the bible became a brand new book not a book became a brand new book the bible became a brand new book why he said now i call you bride he could take the bride and put them over here on this side and you can run it right down the scriptures and you're not confused you know who goes in the rapture you know who don't go in the rapture the bride goes in the rapture in the first resurrection everybody else stays dead for a thousand years foolish virgin people that are justified and sanctified but not the holy ghost filled people they go in the rapture that is the bride of jesus christ not to do with 144 000 we're gone when the 144 thousand are called the reason they're not getting the baptism of the holy ghost is because me and you are still here amen we're holding off two things the resurrection and god going to the jews everybody's want god going to the jews god going to jews what's he going to do we better get what we going to do first what we're going to do to get out of here because we got to get out of the way because he's still got his hand over their eyes because of me and you so it doesn't matter listen and and i don't berate people but you read these people send me emails and they're in the message and they're talking about israel go over to israel and we need to go why we got to take care of this gentile age first remember brother branham had that zeal oh my if i could go out there in the plains of of mamrie or wherever he said he was going to go and he said i'll show them the resurrection sign he said and they'll believe it and they would have but it would have broke all the scriptures in the bible because he was a gentile prophet not a jewish prophet but what it was it was a man feeling the pull of israel because god's not going to forget israel we're going to see here in just a minute that all this building up me and you is to get that daniel 70 weeks and put it back together because it separated because of me and you he was cut off but not for himself who was he cut off for gentiles the bride not the church the bride amen so now eli shall first come and restore all things we know that the prophet of god preached every how many years he preached 30 something years and we have tapes from 47 to 65 we look and we see the lies truly shall first come and restore all things and we know that he did that so let's go to malachi 4 read it again behold i will send you so in other words god's got to send you elijah the prophet he's got to send you somebody to turn your heart back you have to decide whether it's william branham john so-and-so or john doe or who our sister so-and-so right because god's going to put all these things in your way to see what you'll do about it all right and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children we know that was john the baptist because the old pentecost i mean the old testament fathers to the new testament age or children and the heart of the children the pentecost in 1906 to the faith of the fathers because remember the prophet of god had to come just like elias and restore all things so he had to restore worship you see that he was answering questions i've been trying to go back to the con ordering doctrine series the two read books go back through them every once in a while it'll give you what church order it'll put everything right in the word you need to be there'll be no questions he puts it in the bible and he brings us a clarity on how to run the church because the church just got run by this one and got run by that one and brother dale them went to a church a long time ago where you just sit there you know there's no preachers that's right you visited too they just sit there until the unction strikes somebody and they get up and start preaching then this one sits down and another unction and somebody else jumps up and starts preaching well that ain't the way it is what a bunch of confusion but it's a church it's a denomination i don't know what they call herself but they were there and saw it and we know that the prophet of god said the spirit of the prophet subject to the prophet just like he said about speaking in tongues you can control that because you're not supposed to speak in tongues while the preacher is up here preaching doesn't matter listen it may come from god see that's the hard part it may come from god strike you but you've got to hold it until there's an order all right i don't know why i got into that but we all start speaking in tongues we'll promise you they'll be in order we'll be number one we'll be shocked like you wouldn't believe i'm talking about me too but there's an order listen see it's already set for us though we don't have to wonder who's going what book we got to read do we need to read dobson or we need to read this or no we need to get the conduct order and doctrine book out if you believe the prophet coming the end time to restore all things and he was brother adam was the prophet then i put my faith on that i really don't put my faith on william branham i put my faith on god sent william branham talk to me see and once you do that it smooths everything out you put everybody in their place and everybody's got their position you don't elevate him above anybody we don't elevate him above jesus christ and we know that but he was the messenger to bring us what god's already said there is not another one whatever's going to happen from this day forward is going to happen to the jews when it comes to prophets to make the two prophets that are going to israel which we'll try to get to tonight donny all right so let's re all right so if he's going to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse so god's made you a promise he's going to put someone in front of you that's going to take you away from that curse why when we go in the rapture that's when the curse falls the real curse this is not tribulation this is just a little bit of this is just nothing compared to what's going to happen when when we leave this place and there's not any control you say no we don't have control but you know what the world is controlled by the bride you mark my word everything that happens in the world is because somebody's coming to a place in the bride that god saw that they come to and then this is going to be here to combat it because remember satan's not original satan can't bring something first in the spiritual world satan cannot bring something first god has to bring it first god brings revelation god's god brings the word and then satan comes behind it and perverts it all right so if we'll keep that in order we'll understand that so now we know that that number let's read number one we've read this before that we look at malachi 4 and then we also read revelations 10 7 says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery the mystery one mystery of god shall be finished you say brother is there just one mystery yes there's only one mystery to me it's a mystery of you that's the whole mystery the mysterious part that god is going to have a people a bride in the most violent age the most dark age the most confused age he's going to have a bride that he's going to not only take out of this world and nobody's going to know it they're going to take the whole church with them the whole bride's going to go with them there's got to be a resurrection coming this bride there's got to be a resurrection coming this hour that's why i'm i'm harping on that so much we can't have a rapture without a resurrection first and death has got to be destroyed to me that's the revelation that we're going to talk about here in just a minute because no other church age is required to beat death no other church age every church age going to go down to the ground another one's gonna come up gonna go down to the ground another one's gonna come up in the seventh church age there are no more church ages so my mandate and your mandate is to have a voice of the resurrection and we already got the resurrection signed by in a temporary form when brother branham stood and could tell people what they were doing last week next year whatever they'd done 10 years ago he could see it and be 100 accurate that's not a man that's god using a man amen never was wrong right so according to malachi 4 revelations 10 7 is going to do two things this messenger according to mount california turned the hearts of the children of the fathers he took the pentecostal babies that were standing in that meeting you saw him answering some of those or asking brother brown some of these questions they were asking him how to place this how to place that and bring them what back to the revelation that paul had irenaeus had and martin had because they had the true revelation in the first three church ages all right but then there's a mysterious r will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seventh seal and that's i know some are new and those words sound tough and hard but if i can understand it y'all can too okay i mean really if i can understand it y'all can all right because i'm about as hard as as the next guy he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seventh seal so there are seven seals in the bible everybody got that there's not it's not written where where brother brown had to write them again now they were already there the thunders are already there john was beginning to write them and god said don't write them seal them back up in other words i'm going to reveal them in the end time it's not timing john john was down here in the first church age there was a lot to do there was a lot of scripture to fulfill that john couldn't fulfill all right so now let's go to number two and i think we're going to get into this maybe when i finish this series i told you we're going to look at the characteristics of the son of man i believe we need to look at the characteristics of the son of man which we know it's a statue of perfect man but we want to see what jesus how he treated people how he treated the church how he treated the future bride remember there wasn't a bride on the earth at the time because he had his body his physical body was on earth that was the son of man that was his flesh body the body of god was standing on earth right and he can't have two bodies what he was he doing he was prophesying himself that there was gonna bride gonna come when he come back on the day of pentecost which he took his body up and then come back on the day of pentecost and went into 120 and made them little jesus this little bride running around on the earth so now look now he's been revealed to the church ages to the church ages as the son of god remember jesus said i'll come back i'll they're going to send the comforter in my father's name now wait a minute father's name father's not a name so what's the name of the father and who came back on the day of pentecost amen good you ought to be talking about in sunday school because what's the name of the father not jehovah that's a title he only had one name the lord jesus christ i and my father are three no i and my father are one and his name is jesus all heaven there's not another name so in other words you would think as a human that the father's name would be greater than the son's name right so the bible tells me though that all of heaven is named what jesus christ so there's not another name whereby men might be saved so there's not a coming up with a father's name that's different from jesus christ see that's what we it took a profit to bring us that and and then there's so much clarity though you can see it all in the scripture you can see it all in the word of god how that there's only one god and and and thank god that the the two witnesses don't have to deal with the trinity they're not going to be trinitarians they're going to go over there and you know what they're going to do they're going to start preaching and somebody's going to stand up and say hero israel your god is free no they're going to go to the first commandment hero israel thy lord is one and they're going to say finally y'all sent us all them trinitarians remember brother brown i met that jewish guy he said you can't cut god up in three pieces and send him to a jew the jews know listen when the messiah comes he's going to be god now did we know that we do now though we do now though so now he's going to be in the church ages through as the son of god now what is the son of god that's the holy ghost it can't be the son of man now watch the son of man god in human flesh god in his human flesh when he walked on the earth on the shores of galilee and all that matthew mark luke and john when he walked all the commentary that was god walking in human flesh on earth never called himself the son of god he said who do the man say i the son of man am. all right so he was trying to get him to see who the son of man was but he knew they couldn't stand not not stand but they you know it's like eating something you know you keep eating and keep eating and you get so full it may be the best meal in the world like i mean like cantaloupe and gravy man that's good oh and some tomato to go with it y'all ain't never lived until you had that but went but you know what i'm gonna eat so much of it and the church ages could only take so much so god give them a revelation of the son of god because peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus turned around and didn't rebuke him he said okay peter that's what i'll build my church on it's a revelation that i am coming back on the day of pentecost as the spirit of god the holy ghost and i am going to enter in a group of people and they're going to be sons and daughters of god that was their revelation and even god winked at their ignorance when they were become when they become trinitarians because luther was a trinitarian wesley was a trinitarian a lot of those great old ones were trinitarians but god winked at their ignorance because what uh i want to quote where brother reynolds tell and imagine divorce he says because of misinterpreted theology we see we've come to this place every what place you want to say i say anyplace that you're outside the will of god misinterpreted theology is what took you there right boyd said under methodist church misinterpreted theology made him believe that there was a trinity and he needed to be sprinkled instead of baptized and all these other things that all y'all went through were louise catholic right different ones you believe what somebody told you but you know what god winked at that because you were doing the best you could do under that condition but now under conditions that we are now we know better and you know what it makes it more clear it gives us more clarity to the word of god we don't have to go is it is it church on earth or there's a church in heaven there's somebody on earth what no we're going to see that in just a minute now it's been revealed to the church ages to the church ages the son of god god being a spirit the holy spirit he revealed himself in the church ages in the congregation as the holy spirit among the people now cut the rest of that off because that's what i want to speak on later on but not now about this son of man because we get the sign of the son of man which is luke 17 30. as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of light so shall it be in the coming of the son of man which is god back in power and human flesh listen it's not to say that god wasn't in human flesh in those believers but it was a portion their portion they got their portion but when you and i come to this age and the mystery is supposed to be what mystery it's a mystery that you can interpret the word right you because you got to run it through your filter that's right you can't just listen we're not parakeets of william branham that's just saying what somebody else said and i know we quote him we quote him to give clarity because no one could say it listen if he was the prophet in the end time and he was the one who was going to speak to us let him speak he can say it better than i can because that's god talking to us amen and it should be god talking to you now all right let's go number three so we'll talk about the son of man a little bit later to give a little more clarity to that but see to me that's the mystery is that the son of man can be back on earth and you don't see jesus walking in human flesh that's the mystery it's me and you with the full revelation walking in human flesh because listen the son of man took a body change his body went from mortal to immortal he was in a tomb dead completely dead totally dead and now he's alive and the tomb is empty amen so why are we looking for another body if god can change his he can change mine amen if he can that's why i look to that i look to that and because what denomination says no we're going to throw this one away and get us a new one the great mystery is is this was born in sin and it's going to be changed that's right just like jesus body because he said we'll have a body like unto his glorious body as it was in the days of sodom so shall be in the coming of the son of man look at that angel there to the church elect now what's he talking about he's talking about the type of abraham was met by whom melchizedek there in uh i think it was uh genesis 18 somewhere in there 19 he was met by a man in human flesh and he called him lord he knew who that man was see then met him a year or two later i mean before that when he gave him communion when he came back from the slaughter of the king so he knew who that guy was but there was two other angels with him though in this scenario that you see well what happened look at that angel there to the church elect god stayed and talked to abraham because the two other prophets went where they went to sodom right the two angels two preachers went to sodom to what blind their eyes brother brown said a modern billy graham and oral roberts they didn't have the full word they had the word they had the word for their time people were saved under their ministry because they listen lot was saved because of them two angels lot and his family got out of that place they were in right that's the church nominal though that's not the elect the elect stayed on the hill with god abraham was the elect type of us because what happened next he took a body change so he could conceive and have that promised child he and sarah both so jesus said it was the days of sodom so shall be in the coming of the son of man look at that angel down there to the church elect to what he done look at jesus what he's done in his generation look down here in this generation what he's doing now and he's going to bring it in they'll receive a sign but they won't believe it now the prophet of god for years he had prayer lines he had discernment he would tell visions he would tell prophecy he preached the word of god and they loved him just like they loved jesus when he was feeding the 5 000 and healing the sick but when he started preaching his they turned him down now that's they received the sign the sign was just like uh sorry moses started saying no moses was given remember god come to moses and said moses i'm gonna give you some some signs here and i want you to produce these signs to the people and she sure did destroy the whole country because of those signs and then he sends the same thing he sends an angel to brother branham and he says i've been here sent from the from the throne of god to give you a message to give you a commission you'll pray for the sick you'll pray for kings you'll pray for um kings potentates and all the different people and he's like man i'm a kentucky guy he actually was sitting in a cave in a hole when the angel met him right that's why the angel came in the room he was sitting in that cave up there somewhere up in the mountains in kentucky or in indiana or kentucky and he was sitting there praying and this angel just walks into the room you know and tells him what his commission is and you know what he said nothing will stand in your way not even cancer he said you get the people to believe you and he said nothing will stand in your way not even cancer and we saw that nothing stood in that man's way but boy look at it now though people are standing in the way of everything but you know what they didn't receive the real sign the real sign is not me standing up here and telling all y'all you your past and what you're thinking now thank god and all these other things right it's preaching the word of god under the same inspiration and the same revelation that he come to because remember he come to a place in the second part of his ministry he said not in the years of preparation that was a sign to turn you what does the sign do it points you in the right direction if you'll follow it there's some of you in here argue with a sign a stop sign get over it because your sign is sending you in a direction and that's the direction you need to go but they'll receive a sign but they won't believe it oh they love brother branham when he was healing the sick and raising the dead and you know what he done he poured hundreds of thousands of people into their churches because they went message churches everywhere he'd get them saved and born again now what'd he say he said you go back to your church and he said let your light shine there was nothing else he could do but send them back to the church so they didn't receive a sign no he was just a good man he was just a good man during his time but you know the pentecostal said oh said when he started preaching his message he messed up no they messed up because they didn't move on with him they cabbage down on the gifts which is great the healing and the signs and the wonders listen that's wonderful but that wasn't what he was sent for he was sent to take a bride that was going to destroy death by the resurrection sign he said what you see in part he said one day you're going to see in its fullness now if that was part what are we looking at if that was part millions of people healed hundreds of thousands of discernment not one of them wrong that's right even talent told that one girl he was gonna you know she was blind started praying for her and he he said he took her to his bosom and he he said took her back said oh i forgot to ask what color eyes do you want that was god but see that's not going to save you that's not going to make you believe this message but it's a sign to you that there was a resurrection fixing to happen in a group of people the greatest healing that we're going to get is not that god's going to heal you of your ailment my biggest ailment is sin count all them other things you won't do what's keeping us here is unbelief brother branham what sin smoking drinking cussing ran around he said nope the number one sin is unbelief so now that we know that let's get rid of the unbelief because i'll promise you there will be signs and wonders carrying this thing up too brother braham said when the door of the gentile church is closed he said god will do in a year what theologists tried to do in 2000 years he said but it's happening now why it was happening in his ministry and listen he didn't shut the book and go home he handed it to john john or john took it from the from the angel he didn't take it from brother branham but it came just the same an evil and adulterous generation will seek after a sign and they'll have it it'll be given to them as jonah was in the belly of the well i missed oh three days a night so the son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights we know that's the resurrection look but the resurrection will be the sign and the resurrection the sign is given to the church in this last day you see there was a lot of great men back in the church ages a lot of great men that had a lot of miracles but they didn't have the miracles they could stand and tell a hundred people night after night where they were what color shoes they had on what house number they lived at and was exactly accurate every time that was our sign but now are we going to get are we going to get blinded by the light of that are we going to become the light of that because if you become the light of that you can't get blinded if you're looking at something and it's really bright you're going to get blinded but if you become the light you'll never get blinded so that's why we had to move into this next part of the of the ministry and i'm trying to get this to us because until we get into this next part of the ministry there's no two witnesses going to israel read between the lines two witnesses are not going over there do we get out of here so the angel of the holy spirit in the meeting showing the same thing doing the same thing across the nation proving that jesus christ is raised from the dead just the same yesterday today and forever that's the generation that will receive it listen that's our generation that's us there's not another generation sorry there will not be another 40 years on this earth i'll promise you well they may be ain't going to be here i'm talking about we're going to be in heaven i ain't talking about being dead but as we read before this whole thing's based on resurrection so we've got to have a resurrection and a rapture before the two witnesses come and then you know what they preach 1260 days and then they have a rapture all right so let's go to the next one there based on resurrection resurrection the state of having passed completely through death and having risen from death to be in a resurrection is different than to be alive why because the bible says alive and remain shall not forever hinder those of the seed we're going to read that in a minute to be alive is the original state without having passed through death that's why paul said we which are alive and remain because we don't go through death to be in resurrection is to have passed through death and been raised up i thought jesus did all that for us so why do we have to do that that's the question we need to ask ourselves why do we have to go to funerals now we're not supposed to according to according to the end time message we're supposed to destroy death not by putting on some superhuman shirt or or or some kind of something no it's by the word of god how did jesus defeat the devil how did god himself defeat the devil by the word he didn't throw him no sign he didn't throw him no uh create something no he said it is written it is written it is written revelations 20 verse 4 said i saw thrones and they that sounded on them judgment was given upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god see look i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their forehead now that's the people that are still here the bride's the only one do you hear me the bride is the only one that does not take the mark of the beast the foolish virgin and the church they receive that mark of the beast because listen the mark of the beast is where in the forehead in the fate you're thinking not 666 stamped on your forehead it's what you're thinking he's getting you to think another revelation or another denomination or another twist on the word of god but these did not this is the first resurrection these people overcame the beast and they lived and reigned with christ for a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection that's the one we're looking for first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power listen you come up in the first resurrection you don't die again but now some of them are going to come up in the second resurrection and they're going to die again they're actually going to be annihilated they're going to go out of existence if you don't have the that gives me chills but they shall be priest of god and of christ and shall reign with him one thousand years all right first thessalonians 4 13. we read this yesterday but i wouldn't i have you ignorant now look it's okay to be ignorant but it's not okay to stay ignorant being ignorant of something is just it's not it's not a dummy you just don't know what's going on in that one position i'm ignorant when it comes to electricity and and computers and how car runs that doesn't make me a dummy i know some things but if i were to go to school learn how to do electricity i would not be ignorant of that same way with the word of god some say well i don't understand this so i don't that's not an excuse not in this end time it's not an excuse to say well i don't understand this so i'll just put that over that way no everything remember the all the ropes got to be tied back together all right but i want to have you ignorant brother and concerning them with your sleeve we got the two witnesses yet okay that you start not even as others which have no hope look have no hope i went to funerals where the people that were buried had no hope unless at the very end they came to a center salvation because of the life that they lived and then what do you do you just hope well see there's people that we've buried that i don't hope i'll ever see them again i know i'm going to see them again why because the life they lived and the word of god that they lived under in and the and the like i said yesterday the name that you carry with you all right for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so then which are sleeping jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive there's that alive see we're not going through that we're going to be alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are sleep that's what we're doing now we're preventing them for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout now listen like i said before if you read that you go well something's gonna maybe there's one day this something's gonna just go hey no we've already had the shout out according to the message we've already had the shout out that shout turned us away from that old thinking that we had and turned us to the real thinking not a new thinking listen this might be new to us but it's not new to god okay for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout what was revelations 10. the mighty angel came down from heaven with an open book in his hand and how why did he do that there was a people here to receive it listen god doesn't do anything without somebody here to receive it it doesn't matter if it's just going to be five people or two people or one person for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout a message the voice of the archangel what is that the resurrection message and with the trump of god not to to do to do no we know what that trumpet says when it sounds right and it's not going to be a to do to do it's going to be a voice it's going to be a voice and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up remember there is no such thing as a rapture in the bible but we know that's what that is because remember the word rapture is ecstasy the rapture is a is a pinnacle or a height of something that you reach so we've got to get the dead out of the ground first and buddy once we see that it's going to cause a rapture the greatest ecstasy you'll ever see in your life will be for somebody that you know to walk back into this church and sit down because what can stop you then nothing nothing can stop you then then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord look wherefore comfort one another with these words what is the trump of god it's a revelation that death can be destroyed in a human being this die to me that's the great mystery that satan can't even understand because see he knows the day you were born right he know you were born in sin he knew because listen he was the one that that made eve do what she did remember got her to do what she did and guess what that's the way we've all come now let's go to first corinthians 15 51 behold i show you a mystery no paul said behold i'm going to show you a mystery in other words i'm not going to hide it i'm going to show it to you behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye there's that trump again at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and we know what that trumpet says and the dead shall be raised incorruptible now look let me ask you a question right now you're living under that right i'm sorry as pretty as you are you're corruption don't pass out okay i shouldn't use that sound but we all are we were born in sin we were born in corruption jesus's body was corrupting jesus it was dying it hadn't corrupt didn't corrupt in the grave but it was dying right look watch and the dead shall be raised i said look at this yes it shall be raised increa oh no just a little while ago raised incorruptible now where are they laying down in the grave in corruption their body there's a lot of saints that were that died in the first church age you probably can't even find their body dust ashes but god knows where they are my heavens if he created it he ought to know where he's at it doesn't matter if it went through a drain and all down into the ocean he knows where it's at because remember the bible says the body's going to come out of the sea and they're going to come out of this place and they're going to come out of that place but look if we were this this should have said according to what everybody believes except the true believers and the dead shall be raised in a new body because you can't put this word in here unless it was here to begin with that's just something you understand what i mean okay so it had to be corruptable but now it's raised incorruptible so whatever that corruptable is god's going to raise it by the power of transformation by the power of change he's going to make it incorruptible same way with mortal this mortal today you're mortal all of you but jesus reached immortality he had a mortal body and if and if it was just to get a new one that one would have been left in the tomb and you can't read the bible with something left in the tomb because it had to be raised incorruptible so to me that proves now we know when you say new body we'll cover that maybe later on listen i'm not going to look 61 years old i'm not going to have wrinkles in gray hair right it is going to be a new body but it's not going to be another body it's going to be this body made new because one time it was corruptable by what mama and daddy brought but by the power of the holy ghost and even if we have to lay it down into the ground it's going to be raised incorruptible to me that's real simple but most other 99 of the people and most in the message don't think there's enough power of god i don't guess to change pulse it changed this vile body my it started to change when you got the new birth i won't get on that anymore we got to get to the two witnesses for this corruptable must put on incorruption so this corruptible is going to put on incorruption not get another one put on in corruption and this mortal must put on immortality now look behold i show you a mystery now remember according to revelations 10 7 the mystery of god should be finished right that's what he said this bible so it says right here paul says behold i show you a mystery so somebody has got to get to revelation of that mystery not the mystery of the new birth not the mystery of not being but one god the mystery of water baptism that should already be there but we should be at a higher plane to where we see the mystery is and i wrote myself a note somebody will get the revelation of that mystery because you can't say this if somebody didn't resurrect incorruptable and somebody's gonna have to be alive according to the other scripture alive and remain to call them out of the ground you say brother wait this is a fairy tale no it's very real it may be a fairy tale to you it may be a fairy tale to the world but it's not a fairy tale to me it's the truth and it will happen listen you can't stop it from happening all your unbelief cannot heap up and stop it from happening because the whole world is against this and they're not going to stop it from happening amen so now let's go to revelations 4 1. and after this i look behold the door was opened in heaven somebody caught that mystery and the first voice which i heard was as it were what now there's another trumpet talking with me now what did john type he typed the bride not the church john type the bride not the church he tapped the bride so the bride he i heard was it where a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i'm going to pull you up that door you say well you're misquoting it i don't think so come up hither come up hither i'm going to draw you through that door you can't listen john didn't say i looked and there was a door on earth and i just walked right in it no there was a door in heaven heavenly places not way up there in heaven it was a place john couldn't get to on earth it had to open in heaven and a voice had to call me and you up out of that what prophet god said one time out of dead denomination that's and that don't mean baptism or methods that means our denomination come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit i was changing the moment in twinkling immediately i was in the spirit behold a throne was set in heaven and one there's that one guy again there's that one god sitting on the throne now let's we'll get to matthew 17 but let me make a comment here because catching away is what rapture we just talked about that rapture's not even in the bible it's catching away but it is the rapture is a culmination of all the bible what happens in the bible there will be a rapture or a pinnacle or an ecstasy that man has never never reached before now jesus did because he went in the resurrection i mean he went over in his rapture so now listen this catching away though if john typed the bride then see this is not to the this is not to the church that's right it's not to the church why are y'all so sleepy maybe you need to take something take a holy ghost pill before you walk in the door i know that hurts your feelings but i'm sorry you don't fall asleep when you're watching gun smoke gun smoke who watches gun smoke anymore you know what gun smoke is she's like but listen the catching away though is not for the foolish virgin or 90 of the world 99 of the world that's why it's a secret that's why and then the more secret is is that the denominational world says well if we miss the first one we'll get the second one you know that left behind or whatever that was the movie i mean that was made by the antichrist it wasn't it wasn't showing the antichrist in the end it was made by the antichrist because i promise you the bible says you missed the first resurrection you're going to die twice right which the second death has no hold amen so i don't know how in the world you can miss one and not get well anyway and get saved during that time because even the foolish virgin listen the foolish virgin can't get saved full of the holy ghost you understand what i mean well this virgin came to get the holy ghost during the tribulation period nobody can get listen when we go in a rapture the gentile age is over there's no other nations is going to be saved it's going to be two witnesses that go to jerusalem and they take out 144 thousand twelve thousand out of each tribe and that's it so let's go to matthew 17 verse one and after six days jesus taking peter james and john his brother and brings him up to a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun as raiment was white as light and behold they appeared to them moses and elias or elijah talking with him now how in the world they know that's moses and elijah they want no youtube or there wasn't no facebook or or facetime they got a revelation that if jesus was standing there with two men it had to be moses and elijah because elijah's got to come back because that shows the second coming of christ because who's writing this matthew's writing this he wasn't even there he wasn't up on the mountain it was peter james and john peter james and john and jesus all right so there's your two witnesses now let's go to revelation 11 3. i told you we'd get there and i will give power unto my two witnesses now what is power dunamis they're going to get the holy ghost after we leave because if we get the holy ghost before we leave they go in the rapture so you got to be careful with that because there are two witnesses that go over there so they get the holy ghost somewhere and i will give power to my two witnesses because i and it's not in there but it's but you think that i mean as soon as our rapture takes place as soon as we go to the marriage supper i don't think the very next second they're going to start preaching it's going to develop they're going to preach 1260 days that's the promise of preaching 1260 days all right and they shall prophesy or preach a thousand 203 square days clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them fire listen they're not going to be a fire breathing dragon what what they say is going to come to pass they have authority but you know who we're going to have to have that same authority to get out of here it's just going to move from here over to there and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devour their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed in other words what they needed to them they're going to meet right back these have power to shut heaven that it rained on in the days of their prophecy now who did that who did that when they were here elijah remember he said it won't rain for three and a half years and have power over water to turn to blood who did that moses the nile river turned to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will and when they shall have finished their testimony in other words during this time they're preaching the word of god they're going to call out 144 000 and they're going to get born again now they're not going to be bribed because remember the bride's already gone the church is going through tribulation not the bride bride's gone church in 144 thousand is going to i mean i'm sorry the foolish version are going to go through the tribulation period god's going to be speaking to these 144 thousand they are going to what receive that message because we're going to read it here in just a minute and when they shall have finished their testimony and the beasts that ascended out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them now who is this beast the pope the man of sin who's not going to be able to work and incarnate a man until god incarnates us and takes us out of here amen god's got to incarnate us first when satan sees god incarnate us he's going to know how to do it and he's going to go over there and do it and then he's going to do we'll read in just a minute daniel 12 verse 7 and i heard the man clothed in london which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand of the heaven now look revelations 10 7 there was a man put one foot on land and one foot on sea and said time shall be no longer that's gentiles our time will be over at that time but israel is given 1260 days or three and one half years right who is daniel daniel's a jew so they're getting their jewish prophecy like i said before the book of daniel is the book of revelations to the jew and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever that shall be for a time times and a dividing of time one two three and a half years got that time times and uh half three and a half years and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished and i heard but understood not and i said oh my lord what shall be the end of these things remember daniel is wanting to know what's going to happen to his people and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end many shall be purified and made white and tried that's the bride but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand look but the wise the wise shall understand listen i don't have it there but in revelations 18 verse 23 all nations will be deceived by the beast all nations all people will be deceived by this one beast he's going to have so much power and so much authority to but look the wise will understand me and you listen me and you won't have to deal with that guy we're gonna be gone but the church is gonna have to deal with him the foolish virgin these hundred forty four thousand let's go one more and then we'll close it's not eight thirty yet daniel 9 24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to do six things to finish the transgression make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity now that first three part is what the 144 000 are going to receive the two prophets are going to preach jesus christ and it's going to do away with their sin just like me and you do away with their transgression finish it brother brown said the the the transgression is when they put him on the cross let his blood be on us and our children and to make reconciliation for iniquity they should have known better that was their messiah he came exactly the way their bible in the old testament said he would come now look and then to bring in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy and we know what the prophet of god said about that the north to most holy would be us the most anointed people riding back into the millennium and we'll get to that when we cover daniel 70 weeks maybe later on so let's read the 70th week of daniel i want to get to this right here and then we'll then we'll stop questions and answers 1953 then when the church is taken up and he's given us an order of what's going to happen then when the church is taken up now see it says church but you got to remember that's bride right that's not the church the church doesn't show up until after the thousand years is over with everybody got that you all okay can you say it man where i can hear it amen okay moses i'm getting hard of hearing in my old days i didn't think y'all said anything but moses and elijah look appears in revelation 11 and preaches jesus christ now they've been preached jesus christ for 2000 years and god still had their hand over their eyes but something pulled the hand off of their eyes when we went in a rapture it pulled a wall off their eyes or the hand and the holy spirit took from the gentiles look and the rapture comes from the church now that's bride we know that because the bride goes up in the first resurrection that was proven all right and the jews that's left here will be preached for three and a half years because he said they're 70 weeks and the messiah be cut off between them then he's taken away the gentiles will be given a place then they get three more years and a half to be preached to of jesus christ let's go to zechariah 12 verse 10 said and i will pour out upon the house of david upon the inhabitants of jerusalem now what what was david he's a jew david's a jew all right and watch the inhabitants of jerusalem jews the spirit of grace and of supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced now who's that talking about jesus christ there's only one man that's been pierced like that and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn and that day there will be a great morning in jerusalem as the morning of hedorahmen in the valley of mcgidden they officially go back to the battle of armageddon here in just a little while so they get familiar with that valley but they mourn and in zechariah 13 6 and one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thine hands see jesus is not going to appear as if he hadn't appeared to be in you but i know he's got nail prints in his hand but he's going to do through the two witnesses preaching jesus christ they're going to say where are these wounds and what are these wounds then he shall say those which i was wounded in the house of my friends then like i said they're going to mourn and they're going to turn their face and they're going to say we're we're finished we're done he's going to kill us he's going to do away with us remember when joseph perfect type of christ joseph had brought his brothers right they had supposedly killed him however how many years ago that was thrown him in a ditch right so joseph goes to egypt gets elevated to the right hand of pharaoh right he gets to speak in another language and he's probably hit his face or got a different tan and they don't know who he is but he was joseph all the see it was jesus all the time that's who we got revealed to us but then what he's going to do is he's going to call his brethren who is his brethren the tribes of israel remember all of his brothers are the 12 tribes of israel right so they're going to call he's going to call them and they're going to be in the in his presence through two witnesses and then what does the bible say he then he reveals itself to his brethren and what does his brethren say oh we've had it now here's this great man that rules all of egypt remember the bible said the only thing he wasn't was pharaoh pharaoh told him said whatever you do is your business and just i'm still pharaoh all right right so here's joseph and here's his brethren and they're standing around him and he reveals himself and they say oh man we're dead we supposedly killed the one that's getting ready we hope is going to save us right and he said don't worry he said god did this to preserve life remember there were seven years of famine there were seven years of good seven years of famine he said god did this to preserve life through seven church ages he held there couldn't see the mystery couldn't see joseph joseph was always there right nothing changed except him revealing himself he started speaking in their language and took his took his hat off or whatever he had on you know and he said i'm joseph and instead of them running up and grabbing him remember because he had to go run and grab benjamin they said we're dead and that's the same thing's going to happen when the two witnesses show those people that jesus christ was their savior and they put him on cross they said we're dead now where'd you get these wounds he said those which was wounded which i was wounded in the house of my friends so after the rapture of the church god's going to go to israel and he's going to reveal himself to israel and israel is going to mourn but they're not going to mourn for long because when they get to real revelation and they keep hearing that three and a half year message by those two prophets and they see the signs now you've got to be careful they see the signs they listen the jews want a sign right gentiles never needed a sign never needed a sign centurion says whatever you say you know i come to my house lady that was the bread crumbs and all the different things like that and he said i never have found faith in israel but what was the first thing jarius did come in here and put your hand lay your hands on my daughter israel needs somebody to assign where gentiles don't need a sign gentiles don't need that's what i said about laying on our hands that's good but that's not a gentile way gentile way is that centurion i have power you have power i have power for a hundred people and i tell them where to go what he was telling jesus was he said i know you got power over a hundred demons or everything whatever i know you got power you just speak and then i'll just go to the house but the jews had to wait on him they had to wait on the sign they had to wait on him to go around remember he remember he had to run them out of the house because of their unbelief he had to run them out of the house to awaken that girl so but but now god's so gracious though musicians come on god's so gracious so he's going to deal with that just like the way they like it he's going to send them two prophets that absolutely almost destroy the world just by what they say every sign every wonder fire proceedeth out of their mouth what they say will come to pass and the jews are going to say oh we've missed it let's stand our feet but i hope you see because the next section we go into is going to be with the jews and what happens because there's a man of sin comes in he sits in the temple of god showing himself to be as god takes over the world because we're not here the whole world's been taken over by him and listen if you don't have the new birth today you've got the same spirit that's going to be over there the spirit of antichrist i'm sorry but i mean you don't have to stay that way remember you can be ignorant but you can't don't have to stay that way there's a god that can take that away from you there's a god that can take that man of sin out of your life and you'll go in that first resurrection the first rapture let's sing a song 204 what a day it will be if you have a need there is shall come no more clouds in the sky no more tears to dim the eyes all is [Music] listen you gotta believe that day is gonna happen and

and a half years with him while he's dealing with the jews so we'll see him through that promised land what a day glorious day that will be there'll be no sorrow there won't have to go to a funeral [Music] but this is not a fairy tale folks this is the truth this is the truth it's never been spoken before this is the truth that god wanted us to see so he sent us a prophet but he gave us a five-fold ministry to break it down to the people so that you can understand and i can understand what's going on will be oh what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see when i look upon his face
