think about that [Music] we all have no think about that [Music] God's grace [Music] we can't fathom that can we because we're already thinking about going to work tomorrow gotta get up got awesome chicken tonight but not when that day happens nope brother Hal Thomas is not worried about what's going to happen tomorrow there is no tomorrow over there all there is is is I believe that you know brother Brown said that he would he'd send somebody down to the river to help you over because you've never been there you've never done that before you you a little bit you got a little bit tense maybe uh Crossing from this this world into the next World and we don't know that we don't know how that works but we had a prophet that went across and told us he said somebody'll come meet you at the river that you know make you comfortable it's comfortable to know when you somebody you're in trouble and somebody comes to help you that that they get you know I mean strangers help you that's okay but if you get somebody show up that you know it's way more comforting way more comforting somebody that you know will come meet you to try to get you through that get you across that River over into the other dimension but that's that's what I believe that that brother Howe Thomas did last Sunday afternoon somebody helped him across and Ain't No Going Back across that River either ain't no coming back this way uh we're going Saints you're going to come over here but it's not going to be because we're going to die we might have to die to ourselves but it's not because we're going to die physically and then all of a sudden there's something just going to happen no there'll be somebody that will stay here we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those who are asleep amen you love the Lord good to be back in the house of the Lord just remember these announcements brother Ryan has been uh so gracious to to lay them out here for us and uh remember also if you have any questions coming up for the Bible study or the questions and answers I've already got I think three for Saturday if you got any more send them to me on Whatsapp or you can send them to me personally questions that you may have for next week the doors will be open at five for us to have a prayer service between five and six and then from six to eight we will have Bible study or questions and answers downstairs just come be with us and enjoy yourself and then Brother David gadman will be with us that Saturday and he'll be at Bible study because they're coming in about midday Saturday so they'll be with us Saturday night and they'll be with us two services on Sunday uh then brother George Quinn will be the next week next weekend and then there's a little Gap and then October 29th brother Vernon will be here one service and we'll have our fall festival we'll get all that stuff together so remember those things also November the 12th will be our Thanksgiving dinner it's already the end of the year December the 10th will be our Christmas get together as a church down at Hidden Acres so just remember those dates coming up I think that's it thank you thank you again also for the for yesterday for all your support and for all the food that was brought we still got food left over if there's any left over after service please take it home with you because we don't want to have to put it somewhere else all right take it home with you somebody take it and eat it use it don't leave it in the fridge all right well but we've been blessed we were blessed with uh with a lot of food and people to serve it and uh at that time not enough people to eat it but we do have now so we sure do appreciate that and thank the uh sisters for for going the extra mile and helping out so let's buy our heads Heavenly Father Lord you know what's in our heart to get to the people today Lord I pray that it will come out smooth Lord that they will understand Lord and by the Holy Spirit may you slow us down keep us steady Lord keep us all awake and tentative today Lord and as we've all eat a lot during between Services father I pray that you just rejuvenate us Lord let us hear from you father as we were as we were actually hearing from the Lord himself as as you would come and Speak Lord and may they be Lord energized to to make it through next week and and to make it through life Lord I pray that you'd be with each one forgive us of our mistakes and faults Lord to many many things that we do against you Lord we we we're so sorry we're still human but Lord we're heading towards something and Lord I believe that we're we can get there because the Bible told us we could get there Paul said run this race and I'm going to run it to finish Lord to fight the good fight do what we need to do to get out of here Lord I pray that you should bless the Thomas family again Lord fill that Gap up be with all the ones Lord that sick and not hear be the ones that are sin sick Lord the many ones that we've that we've we're missing in service Lord I pray that you would touch their heart and bring back to you Lord just father just be with us in the further middle service touch each one in Jesus name amen in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God now this word we're going to talk about in just a second this word is this when we say the word of God bless you when we say don't do that again in about 30 minutes no if you do that without heart attacks on the building no it's okay I'm gonna get one of those horns and go why she just did it for me what's your face red for anyway this word that we're talking about here it's a person all right it's a person everybody with me with that this is not just words on a page black and white all right this is a person the word was made flesh all right and was it imperfect nope it was not imperfect it was a perfect word that was made flesh and that perfect word that was inside that flesh now I didn't say the flesh was perfect all right not yet but what was inside that flesh was perfect and it spoke what perfect word it spoke perfect word everybody with me because we're going to get to that in just a minute and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can be seated Lord as blessing of the reading of the word I want you to really listen to that do you believe that Jesus Christ was the word of God Amen we believe that that word was a perfect word yes and we believe he spoke that word 2 000 years ago he spoke that very word that's going to redeem us heal us all the all the Redemptive plan everything's going on was in that three and a half year Ministry of Jesus Christ never was that he had to say oh I'm sorry I said that I didn't mean that I meant this so it was plainly written in the Bible but as being black and white letters it's going to lay there we're going to read it but we're going to have to take that off that page and put it into flesh now that's exactly what God did from the Old Testament come on he took the Torah what he told Moses Moses Moses described it wrote it Isaiah Jeremiah they all wrote it and put it in Scrolls right natural Scrolls now when they unscrolled out and read it in in the in the the time of Caiaphas and different ones about the time of Jesus it was what they had read for years and years and years but it really didn't do anything oh yeah it helped them but it become a ritual right God even says it's a stink in my nostrils all these sacrifices and everything you do and just you know frivolously but one day whatever they were reading was born birthed into this world by the word that was spoken it became flesh and then it was not silent of course you know we always called the 29 years of Jesus's life was the silent years because it really wasn't nothing much written but my when he started speaking it only took him three and a half years to give us all the sermons all the religion the religion that we have in that three and a half year message and then then God depended on listen to this God depended on four men to write it down put it right back on paper again some men will take it off some men will leave it on I say man I say preachers you me are we reading dead letter I thought that word was made flesh in you so whatever was written by Matthew Martin Luke and John and all the other prophets in the New Testament it's laying there just like it was in the Old Testament what are we going to do about it it's got to come off of those pages again and be not born as a baby but born inside of you by the new birth everybody with me that's why the new birth is so important it's why you can't understand this guy this guy this man this person this Jesus Christ he was speaking by what by the Holy Ghost not by person not by an individual person Jesus was an individual person but he was God there wasn't any room for the devil there except in his flesh he kept pounding on his flesh all the time but he couldn't get to that man that was inside and when that man would speak he spoke from what from what was inside of him but he spoke from exactly he said I only say that what what the father gives me that's what I say if we could just preach like that if we could just preach what the father gives us you'd be received some good some bad because remember he wasn't very popular when he spoke what the father said amen it's my brother Branham when he started preaching what the father told him to preach he wasn't very popular man all right you won't be either John 3 verse 3 says Jesus answered and said now this is the word speaking I say unto you except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God he's compelling you to enter into a place that he's in to understand who he is all right because nobody understood listen No One during that three and a half year Ministry of Jesus listen even when he was 13 his mother and father didn't really know who he was because his mother denied him your father your father and I are sinking after you she said me and Joseph brother Brown said she denied the Virgin birth and she was the very one that did it she was an active participant of that and still brother Brown said let down the bar by her Humanity but she didn't understand who he was not not directly do we is that word being made flesh and me and you now here's the word himself again speaking John is writing the commentary he hears what Jesus said he's putting it on a piece of paper that Jesus says I have yet things to say to you but cannot bear you can't bear them now in other words what you don't have the Holy Ghost you're not going to understand me they didn't understand it much anyway he said how be it when he the person the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into some truth Lord I need to make that bigger it says all I can't stand when people even nowadays they say well well we can't all be perfect we can't all be right you know we can't all have this I mean you can't yeah you can yes you can if you'll get yourself out of the way and let the father start speaking he will not preach error God cannot there is no error anywhere in his person he don't even know where he knows of it he knows people are in error but he's not in error so why can't we get into him look at the Apostle Paul Apostle Paul was close he had the mind of God to write 80 percent of the of the New Testament putting it in paper and pen so that you and I well I mean it's even an eternal word of God none of that's going to go away the Bible's not going to go away it's going to be lived like it's supposed to have been but when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself like it was talking about last Sunday he's not going to speak of himself he now is saying bride bride bride you got to get it you're going to get it through the bride she is him we had to have a Prophet come and tell us she is him the scripture that speaks of the bridegroom also speaks of the Bride yes we had to have a problem to tell us that because Wesley didn't Luther didn't thank you Calvin Penny they never said that they never said now I call you Brian either I mean they understood that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved live a good Christian Life right but to going up into the spirit of God to where you can walk in pure truth and not have error it wasn't for them we'll get to that in just a minute but look but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak the bride The Voice the final voice and the final age is in the bride sure it's Jesus Christ sure it's our husband sure is our bride groom but he's speaking to us he decided that yes we didn't we didn't make that up we couldn't it had to come from somebody that knew what he was talking about that I'm going to have a bride a gentile bride in the end time that's going to take the words off of that page and gonna make them live yes foreign [Applause] and he will show you things to come listen brother Brown said he said what there's no more prevailing power than a revelation why because it has to come from God Satan will not give you a revelation he might give you part truth listen the greatest lie ever told 99 true am I right you shall not surely die one word God said You shall surely die if you eat of that tree Satan said You shall not surely surely die oh my come on one word off Revelation 19 6 and I heard his word the voice of a great multitude listen I love the Bible because the Bible to me let me see if I can get this right like I was thinking about the Bible sure brother Ram said it you know it's multi-layered it's to the bride to the center but it's written to Christians all right bottom line the Bible's written a Christian okay so it's for us to hear and to see but it also looks it says right here excuse me we're wondering in this time or in any other time if we're Worthy or if we're going to make it or if this is really true that we're going to be a mature group of people well God just waits till the very I'm gonna get to Genesis 1 because that's when he told us we were perfect 126 he told us we were perfect now he goes all the way to Revelations 19. and proves it he calls you his wife and you have made yourself ready that's what I was trying to say here we go all right I get it right what God does is he tells you who you are he tells you who you are tells you that he told Israel You're The Chosen your God you're mine I can't forget you I may have to divorce you but I'm gonna go way over here in Revelations what is it 7 or 11 and I'm gonna send you two Prophets a promise over him they didn't look like much of a promise we're divorced he's put us away we're not even his anymore go all the way over to Revelations when he sends those two prophets to get 144 000. then thank God he sends a prophet and tell hey there's going to be a fifth still Jew God's not going to forget you so what God does is he gives us our promises lets us go through trials and tribulations because remember the two books that Satan hates worse is what Genesis Revelations why in Genesis obviously it tells us in Genesis 1 26 we're perfect we're God we're God's children we're supposed to subdue the Earth have dominion over it it don't look too good in between all right but we get over here on the other end of it let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is coming his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted Genesis 1 26 it was granted but it had to be what it had to be put away for a little while so he could be savior healer Redeemer restorer there could be a Matthew Martin Luke and John there could be an Isaiah that could be all these different things and then pop up over here and say hey you're perfect that group that I was talking about over here you made yourself ready and to hurt was granted that she should be a raid and finally in and clean and white for the final Linen in his righteousness of saints brother Brown talks about and you must be born again we're talking about this morning you're still what you were until you're born again now we were talking about the soul this morning we'll talk a little bit more about it but you are who you are you're that's your soul your soul is who you are your soul listen brother around thank God for a prophet that told us he said look there's no there's no way that God can take your soul out and put it in somebody else I don't believe in pre-existence of Souls all right so what was Genesis 1 26 it was a pre-existence of souls but not individually from God away from God we weren't walking around with God we were walking around in his mind we were walking around in his mind in his thinking in the Eternal part and the Eternal part not the section of what he thought of but to Eternal part that's why brother Donnie that if we see Genesis 1 26 then Revelation is 19 shouldn't be a surprise right so it doesn't change you all these other things the only thing that changes you is what in your soul by the burning of the word that's just plain it takes your nature nothing doesn't kill you now remember brother Graham said I don't believe in pre-existence all right so we weren't all oh you know people do it all you know you see people they go oh brother I just feel we was back there together oh yeah you gotta do that I'm not making fun but that ain't right if it ain't right it's wrong okay we were not back there shaking hands and walking around looking at each other brother what were we before we were nothing only in the mind of God were you something so no we weren't walking around because see that's the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls real quick everybody understand or don't understand I'm fixing to give you a real quick but Mormons believe we're all walking around in heaven somewhere a long time ago whatever years and years and we were all just like this sitting around by me we were sitting around with robes and we were talking and in other words Satan got a group of people to believe this and Jesus got a group of people to believe this and and the father was in the middle and the father he wanted Jesus's plan was better than Satan's plan so Satan got mad took his people and went to Earth then what we got to do is we got to come down here and go into flesh and represent God and then go back to Heaven again that's really complicated to me okay we were nothing you have no memory of coming from the womb or before all right some of y'all may have good memories you did not remember the day you were born but I promise you you did remember the day your second birth happened you better remember that day your second birth happened the second one so brother random what were we we were nothing all right so he didn't believe in the Mormon Doctrine phrase this is the souls or transmigration do you ever you know what transmigration is it's like God God's not really happy with me being in this one so he's gonna me and Michael gonna swap me either buddy maybe our age but so there's so all right point is when you're born a baby God breathes into your nostrils the Breath of Life then you become a living soul that Soul stays with you it is inside of you for your whole lifetime and Beyond well I feel I got this you better only feel one thing that your soul has been changed by the new birth that your soul has been burnt out amen not killed because if you can't God if God kills your soul your dad then you would come up another person we're not that way no let's keep it straight your soul when you were born to make a what a choice yes whatever your choice is that's what continues with you through your life till you come to the day that you pass away and when you pass away that Soul goes somewhere it's not drifting around it's not laying in the grave it's some some denominations believe called Soul sleeping that when you die you just lay in the grave and there your soul lays just dormant like you know like God did the last witch he light switches on when he was a born baby and then when you die the light switch goes off and everything stays in the grave I don't believe that one either I don't even like that one who would like that to be your religion I'm I'm claustrophobic I don't want to get woke up right in the middle of six foot and under we think it's silly but these people base their adoptions on that that's how Satan is in a port Getting In a Pulpit he's so tantalizing like the one says well anything contrary to the word of God the devil is the one that conjured up all right anything all this that we're talking about anything that's been besides the word of God that's been thought of is of the devil nice thinking this more this afternoon you know we we talk about casting out devils all right we'll get back to our subject maybe I'll tell you this before I forget it we talk about casting out Devils right say you have a devil devil on you for sleeping tell you I told him I was going to come back here but you know we cast out Devils we speak we we pray over them and if you gotta say whatever all right XYZ um brother Brown talks about epilepsy a lot he tells you to close your eyes I mean he's so serious about that he said that demon is so wants to get into something he said you better not lift your eyes up when that thing gets cast out but you know what think about this those are all lesser demons when you get to New Birth it ain't a lesser demon that goes out of you it's the Devil Himself it's the Devil Himself it's not a it's not a secondary demon or a little imp or something or no it's the real man himself the devil keep his eyes in your soul brother Brown said face her doubt right there's only two powers so when you get the new birth that's why it's so important you can be you can be haunted by other smaller demons but the devil is the one you want out of your soul everybody with me on that so when you get the new birth the head honcho leaves you the one that gives you all I mean he's going to still trouble you but he will not be able to take your soul and tell you the hell no way God's grabbed that thing and he's got it he's got it just like this right here and listen what God puts in his hand remember he said I'll not lose one I'll not lose one but now the devil just soon you'll be lost the rest of your life right so think about that then you burnt that's what it is it's going you're going straight to the head honcho both of them all right you're going straight to the head two demons I mean the demon in God you're going two people now buy with me because Antichrist spirit will come into the church to file it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless I want to ask you a question today has you done that to you he's not worried about these walls anymore he's worried about your church your Tabernacle make it lukewarm formal powerless it's a pulpits where it started no wonder it's a damnation of the country when Satan got into Pulpit it's the truth failing the preached unadulterated word of God and the word of God look will produce exactly what he said it would do it's what I said if it's on the page it's got to come off the page but when it comes off that page when that Bible when that word of God comes off that page it's got to produce Jesus Christ it can't produce nothing else but Jesus Christ we try to explain it all the way then we come to the first seal and we see that God through the prophet he's in the first seal he's getting ready to break the seal getting ready to break all the seals says look broken to whom not Christ but to the church and then I believe he conscious he pauses a minute notice now oh oh my that just makes me tremble I I hope that you the church truly understands see what I mean you people then he catches it he said now I'm going to call you bride that you'll understand that you'll be able to separate Church from bride foolish virgin from bride all right listen so there's our formidable opponent now look that opponent's been driven out of your soul by the new birth but he is an opponent he's still going to fight he's going to fight you in your spirit Realm the rest of your life but we have Satan's answer because brother Brown says look there's been bride churches churches Brides churches Brides brides but there's got to come one there's one that's going to be the perfect Church in the end time I don't mean perfect church building I mean The Perfect Bride everybody with me there has to come a real bride not that they're false but they're real bride in other words they're dressed exactly correct The Headstone is able to come down and not be offset turn to one side fit straight on it listen you better start believing that because that's our requirement in this age come to until we come to that place until we find that place was it good dude to polish the hubs all right let's go right here I wonder Ephesians 4 grieve not the holy spirit of God will buy you our sealed until the day of redemption that's what we do all the time we do we grieve him look he says let all bitterness and wrath as well the Bible was talking about this morning bitterness wrath anger clamor evil speaking be put away from you with all malice in other words that's what'll make him go into on the limb out there all right but you can't one to another tender hearty forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you but that's in the enemy Gates the holy spirit is timid just real timid just any little Interruption bothers him I pulled up some quotes a few minutes ago and there was so many I couldn't bring them I just put in sit still brother Branham said sit still stop moving around everybody's wanting to move and everybody's wanting to do all the he said sit still what did I say on the backside of that column right there hmm didn't what brother Brown say when you've done all he to do he said what stand be still stand there Moses stand there and watch the glory of God now look Hebrews 4 12 this is I wanted to read this morning I forgot to put it in here now watch for the word of God now here we go back to what I just said about the word of God the word of God is perfect the word of God is complete the word of God does not have anything out of cater anything out of water it's eternal but remember down Through the Ages it got eroded Through Time by preachers saying the word of God is this trinitarian Doctrine the word of God is this different baptism the word of God is just believe in the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved thus in your birth amen that's not what the word says so we had to have a Prophet come in the end time with the perfect word of God to give us the Divine and perfect interpretation of the word of God so that we can look at Hebrews 4 12 and see where it comes from and what happens when it comes because when the word of God comes it's quick powerful sharper than two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and Spirits so that was a prophet coming in time said hey your soul that's what's important hey he said hey that Soul that's the real you hey that soul is what God's working on today not Spirit Soul he divided and then he said you got a spirit there's memory reason conscious affects and Imagination Adam Johnson marrow proving to you that you're three different groups Body Spirit so all right and discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so let's look at the soul again let's put it in a little Genesis 1 26 here Genesis 1 26 is what that's the soul of God that's the soul of God everybody with me the way we're supposed to have come brother Michael we were supposed to have come like we're going to be am I missing anything we were supposed to come the way we're going to end up all right true Genesis 1 26 had there not been a fall we'd we would have all come here and given a body that body be made Eternal in a change okay everybody with me all right and then we would have had then God would have been not complete right he could have never healed anything because nothing there was the hill he surely couldn't redeem us because we're unredeemable if we're if we're God God didn't need Redemption we need Redemption that's why we got lost that's why they call it a fall we fell from this right and God knew that brother Brown said God knew when he put that in flesh it would fall all right but that was not the marring that was the marring of the Masterpiece but not the doing away with it it actually made the Masterpiece because then God could be I'm Gonna Save I'm gonna redeem I'm going to heal I'm gonna give you the desire of your heart you can move a mountain if you need it moved right so the salt these were all in God's mind we were there in that lump sum of of theophany God not a second person that's not a psychic person Genesis 1 26 is not a second person of God it's an extension of the one God it's God in another form everybody with me all right so here's that soul but remember when when Adam and Eve did what they did when her womb natural was polluted it not it polluted her spiritual womb her womb right everybody with me so God God said I can't come that way now all right so I'm going to withhold brother around says the book what is that book is she it's you and me it's the family of God the Eternal section all right everybody with me that in that book that brother Brown said said that God had to take it back from Adam Adam was going to have the ability and then remember there's no words in here now because the Bible had been written but but your name is your name is in this book we know it's a Bible we know it's in God's mind but it wasn't written like this it was in the mind of God and he was handing it to Adam said hey that couldn't happen because the womb got polluted so brother Brown said God took the book back and he held on to it and all during this time he still got the book Hey listen ho God can't change so he didn't change this book he just delayed the time for it to come into existence so he could be a Healer Redeemer ah Jehovah all the compound names it was in him but if he were to produce this book it would have never been it would have just been Perfection just like what we're going to yeah just like what we're going to an eternity in a human body eating drinking fellowshipping but listen if God would have just done that over here there would have been no Isaiah that have been no Abraham there had been no Malachi to stand one day and say behold I send you Elijah the prophet that would have been none of that it would have just been us that had been no foolish virgin come on it had been no foolish virgin because that wasn't in this part this is the Eternal section they're going to be given eternal life right this is not these people are not given eternal life they are eternal life right now it's time for y'all to go to sleep I figured it hit about what time is it now three o'clock about time about 30 minutes after I started so anyway check yourself just for a minute so this is this is all God All Souls are mine so he's he's releasing Abel Kane not from here though no no no he's releasing him from here them from here I'm going to have an Isaiah I'm gonna have a Jeremiah I'm also going to have a Balaam I'm also going to have a cane but not in this book this book's special this book is sealed by Seven Seals sealed up nobody can understand but I'm going to have an Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel because see they've got to what speak the word so that he could come in flesh and brother Robert said he stepped out on the prophecy of all those Prophets so it's plans perfect but to get us From Here to Eternity there had to be a redeemer come and he had to come according to the word of God because he was the word of God I just read that to you and that word was made flesh it was spoken by Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel and and sorry if I forget any of y'all little prophets all down through here and I am because it's the whole Bible is what is the is the word of God okay all right but you got your minor problems and your major problems but anyway Moses and all that see even Moses listen Moses is not a born-again believer he never receives a new birth Isaiah never receives a new birth right they received an anointing they were in the mind of God and God said I'm going to use them and they're going to turn to me and let me use their voice defeat what I want to get to the people so in them yielding themselves to me I'm gonna make them eternal because Isaiah will be there Jeremiah will be there Abraham will be there but listen they will not be bride they're not part of this book now listen they're in this book but I'm talking about this book we're locked on about over here the book of the redeemed the book of the Bride yes because today by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got that in your soul yes Isaiah Dutton listen the blood of bulls and goats only covered sin it's still piled up but when you come to Calvary he puts one hand that way and one hand that way he takes them all in forgives them of their sin and then says I'm going to have a ride let go of these names in this book because these are the ones that got lost over here making any sense so this is withheld this is special listen I love Louise with all my heart but he's I know but you're not a Dale sorry I know that's hard sometimes to even be one but um when I open when I open my oh Lord when I open my family album Luis is not in here my family album personal The Dales the Family Bible right because he wasn't born from my lineage right but now listen what about God has a lineage okay he has people that he's permitted to come on the Earth but they're not part of his lineage this is his lineage because what is what is the lineage of me and Terence and Anna and all the ones down to that it's from my dad dale dale blood Dale genetics God blood God genetics God family but now he's gonna have an ombud body but when will it be the family of God because see that's what the importance of the opening of the seals are that I ain't going to get to today is to be able to see because remember brother Brown said what did he do when the book opened in Revelation 5 he said John was crying at one time this book was closed sealed remember it was really a scroll not a bug but scroll see it was Seven Seals no way anybody can know what was in it but when uh but when it came into the hand of the orig from the original owner into Jesus Christ's hand now listen the scripture that speaks of the bridegroom speaks also with abroad him standing in Revelations 5 was me and you inside of him standing there that's why brother Brown [Music] 's because John got born again you get his book and you get it open and you get to reading it you read your name in here you read yourself You're such bad things in here from you God don't have them in this book prove that Revelations 19 I understand you made yourself ready somehow so Genesis 1 26 that's the soul of God but God said All Souls are mine but not to Genesis 1 26 man that's him this is him remember it's not unless you're part of him this is him all right made manifest in a many-membered bride okay but now in his mind like I said before he has to be able to bring a soul that was part of his mind part of the seeing of everything like Balaam uh Judas all the different ones all the different ones that are the bad part we say the bad part Cain he saw those two he just didn't preserve them in a book because they weren't part of not saying you're Judas no but they weren't in the family album okay didn't find them nowhere but when the Books open over here and I remember it doesn't change from there to here God can't add in that one now listen in the other Book of Life your name can be taken out judas's name was written in the book but it was taken out your name never moved your name stayed around where it was at now listen brother but I'm sure your name goes on the book is the believer of sanctification that's to you on Earth we're talking about the new in glory that's why I believe and I don't have a quote for it but I believe well I do Paul said we're living in Heavenly places right your soul by the new birth you're in another dimension your Soul's just in another dimension because it's not even of this world it's not even supposed to been in this world by the new birth and you're not supposed to be here but you are to do what to sleep I mean to give glory to God preach holy water here we go ready I'm glad I'm hoping my mom was not watching that got on the ground I really hope she is Genesis 1 26 man though that's a special group of people God has allowed souls to come on Earth and he's the only one who can give life so he gives life but remember when you come over to the New Testament though he said hey don't worry about the guy that can kill your body there's only one person see Satan can't even destroy your soul that's how much power he don't have he don't have power to do anything except make you sleepy and all them other things he does but he has no power to destroy your soul you destroy him yourself listen blame nobody on the dead judgment it's not going to be Satan standing beside you it's going to be you and you're gonna have to give an account that's why we have an advocate here on the Earth we don't have to go to the lifetime judgment we have one right here today standing right here saying father forgiving yes the real him didn't do that wait a minute Glory you ought to wake up that's it that's why I'm that ad but remember this Genesis 1 26 didn't need an advocate got it but you need one over here because you're in a fallen condition in your spirit realm is still being beat up by the devil but that's all like I said God you know Jesus is not standing here being your Advocate saying now I don't know why he did that um but would you please no he knows exactly it didn't happen in your soul that's why a sinner sins from their soul thank God for a prophet that told us Christians have sins but it's not in the soul it's not something to determine whether you go to the white Throne or not it determines how you get through the day he determines how you grow up in that Satan does not listen Satan doesn't want Jesus on this Earth again he can't defeat him the first time he's not going to be able to defeat him this time in a bride in a many-membered body not just one and a mini-membered body a bunch of little Jesus is running around here born by what the word yes poured by the word of God the perfect word of God second Peter 1 verse two say grace and peace I'm not getting where I want to go Grace and peace be multiplying the use of the knowledge of God of Jesus our lord now remember this is First Peter starting this is your new birth according as is what divine power he is not not Peter's he is Jesus right divine power I'm going to read what that word divine means in a minute hath given unto us all things that pertaining to life in godliness to the knowledge of him that's called us to go and virtue whereby are you given to us exceeding great and pressures promises listen we didn't need those promises over here there was no need of any of that over here you know what I'm kind of glad we had a fall three because we know about Redemption now see there's Angels standing over here that are still in the same place they were standing over here they're standing today they don't know anything about Redemption they don't know anything about fall they don't know about being healed they don't know about being redeemed and that that God's given us Revelation and more Revelation they don't know anything about that but we as humans do because of a fall because of the Fall we come here able to get on our knees and say God I'm so sorry forgive me of what I just thought or or his brother Bob was talking about forgive me for speaking against a brother or for or for thinking bad thoughts against the brother we got to quit that now we do it let me get on out a minute we do that Bob you started there we gotta love her brother yeah the Bible says love them as you love yourself pray for those who despitefully use you try that sometime do good to those that hate you try that sometime the Bible said it keeps coals of fire on her head if you do in other words it Heats everything back on them when you don't get mad listen Satan loves to provoke you to see if you your reaction and if you don't provoke back like Jesus you know Jesus Satan's standing there talking to Jesus said hey man if you're if you're if you're I know you can turn these stones into bread and man you look hungry you haven't ate for 40 days Satan in his old stupid mind he said he's going to take me up on that and I'm gonna own him now the Lord just said no no Satan don't provoke God the whole thing was don't provoke I'm not don't you're trying to provoke me I'm just gonna tell you what the word says in other words I'm not going to jump back in and start fighting with you I'm not fighting with the Devil everybody with me yeah we fight demons all the time you understand what I mean but I'm not gonna fight him when he says you're this that and the other and I know I'm not let that real man speak that real man inside of you that real sister too and I'm getting the sisters that's all of us let that thing speak inside of you let it out we're about giving us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the Divine and other partakers all right now listen we didn't lose we we just didn't come here with that divine nature no but but but we didn't come down to a place where God said I forgot him I want to write him in no you were already there he was hearing your s through the blood huh remember brother Brown said one second and God in front of God like we are he said we'll be out of here we'll be gone he hears your voice through the blood he said that's my kid I'll promise you if Zoe eurago was down at the stadium at the Braves game 50 000 people and she got in trouble and started screaming Christine and Luis wouldn't know exactly who that was so don't be worried will you get in trouble in front of seven billion people God's going to hear your voice above all the clamor and all the all the screaming you just say Lord I need you you know what he does he goes hey my kid's talking need y'all to be quiet think how much power being in the family of God is being in the family of God just being born again gives you a lot now watch this that you might be protective of the divine nature of having escaped the corruption lives in the world through lust now look at this word divine the word divine actually means fails which is God or the godhead of Christ aren't we part of all that spoken of the only and true God whatever can in any respect be likened to God that's the divine nature of God Romans 8 14 says if you have not you have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry I have a father so when you receive the new birth you know that all it does is just calls your name out of the family album so that means that you know Who You Are all right amen because remember you're shut off you're alienated from knowing anything about that that's why you can't go back and say me and Donnie was back before the world and we were shaking hands and we were listen when all that shouting for joy and all that and job that was in the mind of God that wasn't people running around okay everybody with me on that I know some of you went back and said well what about that well that's not people running around it was in the mind of God there's a spot and that thought was projected today Joe where were you he actually asked Joe where he was he knows where we are where were you he didn't ask me that he knew where I was I'm in this book he knows every name and all that's doing now is is it's revealing you on Earth that's what you was back there everybody with me on that I'm a son and daughter of God I have the promises I have the divine nature I have eternal life I have passed judgment if I have to go by the grave so what my name's still in the book God didn't have to shift how Thomas's name around in the book no he just said hang on man buddy he said the rest of them they got to get ready and when they get ready we'll come back we're all going to come back together actually yeah they'll be all right maybe I'll woke you up a little bit and if children then heirs Heirs of God now what is the heirs you're an error of God and Jordan heirs with Christ because he's the one that was holding the book also the Father and Jesus is not the same person he just got a name down here same guy okay there's not there's not a father here and a different person down there that came out from there no you're not even another person that came out from God when he said let us make man in our own image even when brother random would say that that when the logos says something stepped out to speak it was just God stepping forward and speaking wasn't leaving somebody behind where there's two or three Spirits running around no it's the same spirit of God in the same person of God and he spoke your name at the new birth and he didn't have to go into another book to find it he came straight from him all the father has what given me will come and uh what not lose one of them praise the Lord wherefore lay inside all malice and all guile hypocrisies envies and evil speaking that's newborn babes as they were talking this morning this is kind of where we stopped at as newborn babies desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be that what you have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming us into a living Stone we're heading to the stretch of a perfect man disallowed of men not everybody is going to be a child of God not everybody is going to come to The Headstone or come to adoption it's your choice though it's your choice to whom coming us into a living Stone disallowed of men and precious all right now look this is at your new birth now because we got to get this checkbook because that checkbook's gonna appear back over here in your adoption but it's going to have a little bit different a little bit different terminology when a man is born again the spirit of God brother Brian 1955. God gives him a checkbook that'll last him all through life's journey and at the bottom of each check has got Jesus's name signed to it because he's the one that redeemed you right and he has all the power to back it up you don't yeah because you might not write a check just exactly right come on power without character it's a bounce check Jesus's name signed to it and you just fill in what you need it's yours already paid for now surely you're not afraid that it won't be cashed if you're afraid if you're afraid just hold that book in your pocket he said but no if you're born again he gives you that checkbook and you know for a fact that Jesus is your Redeemer your healer and all these different things you just write the check you don't worry about that name down there because you know who that is and he has all power in Heaven and Earth backing him up but at that point though he's not able to give you the checkbook and you sign it not yet but you're in the same line all right out there it's the same my mama would give any of y'all well never mind she wouldn't give us one either a check with our her name written at the bottom of it but we're family she should then she has but you understand what I mean if you're not in the family why would he write you a check why would he write you a check why would he hand you a checkbook but the ones in the family though he gives them a checkbook with his name already signed Bank Of Heaven whatever you need because you're in the family of God your name's been called you have received the new birth you've received that piece of Genesis 1 26 that God saw over here you you have received that piece of right because remember look we can't be silly we're not the fullness of the godhead bodily in our own self but listen God's soul is who somebody say God soul is God all right if we're part of the soul of God we're just another extension or another attribute but it's still God because there's only one form of eternal life and that's God so you're then you're not a second person you're the person of God in another form called bride and that's what he wants he let's look just for a second well ain't gotten a Spirit Room yep but let's talk for just for a second that's all right we'll finish up a Wednesday night let's go to the spirit your soul if you're born it's it's it's complete your soul but listen sin is so awful in the sight of God so he will allow you as a free moral agent to press that thing suppress it I mean why if we're all born again why are we all still sick why are we dying why don't we because we're not believing who we are we're not believing who that real person inside of us is even though you may have it we're not getting it maybe we're not getting it all but I pray to God that we can because we've been given the word of God to rightly divide what your soul does for you what your spirit realm does for you and what your flesh does for you right I don't believe anybody else any other time I'm not talking about me I'm talking about this when brother I'm come he sends us the perfect word of God and it rightly divides the soul from the spirit from the body tells us over here that Soul faith will die that's it middle round five senses out of Rim five senses and how they work Peter understands understood a little bit of it because he talks about the divine nature of God so you receive the new birth and in second Peter he says in verse five he says and besides this huh we've read it many times before read it almost 100 times but look is that a more now clear to you your new birth is in your soul it will impact your spirit realm if you'll let it because listen your soul only feeds on what the word of God it will not feed on error it will not feed on part word that's why the pure word had to come in the end time to energize your soul that when your soul gets ready to speak there's not something there it says that's not true a man that's why it was so important for Malachi to speak and for for something to materialize out of Malachi a prophet with the spirit of Elijah they can put all this stuff back together he can pull it apart and put it back together so Peter says and besides this besides this divine nature besides even though you get the new birth even though you get eternal life in your soul besides this giving all diligence add amen I thought you couldn't add to God you can't add to God but you can add to you because you're still a human sorry you still have a memories and conscious imagination and that's where the Battleground is the greatest battle ever fault is not in your soul you're either one or the other and if you've got one in fact you got that old Chief demon out then you're good yes but that's not all Peter's saying hey I was there today at Pentecost something came down inside of me and just burnt everything out all that all that old fisherman junk and cussing and spewing and stewing and cutting people's ears off and telling Jesus I'll never deny you don't you wash my feet um then he said then he then he got Peter and he said hey I want you to preach this preach this to my people because 2 000 years from the time you write it somebody's gonna need it and no what it's for ever and know how to get it maybe they didn't know back in the in the in the church ages but this time for the full word to be made manifest time for the opening of the seals to open up to show us that we do need Faith versions of Godless brother kindness not just humanly but we need God's virtues besides this giving all diligence add to your new birth knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity Ephesians 4 verse 14. the women henceforth be no more children all right now we're not children anymore we've come out we've we've got born again now we're working on the spirit realm of us which is our playground all right that's Devil's Playground everybody with me if it's not yours pray for me my memories what's killing me my reasoning is what's killing me and all those other ones imagination and carried about look that way his fourth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about what is he telling in Ephesians he's talking to a mature group he's saying we got you you got to come out of that being babies you got to get away from it being babies I I can die for you and Patch you and give you a a pacifier every once in a while but you gotta come out of that you gotta start eating some strong meat what was Paul saying you got to start understanding what I'm telling you and not wondering about with it then we hit forth be no more children toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slide of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ pulling that thing's pulling you up that statue of perfect man first Peter 2 verse 1 says ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by God to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone look a Chief Cornerstone he's not talking about that because that's been rejected the head the son of man Ministry but he started down here building on the day of Pentecost as the Cornerstone all right to build up a house what when we when you put a foundation down what do you do you build something on it but it's got to be a sure Foundation which it is I say the word of God is a sure Foundation a cheat I lay a Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him look shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient all right the stone which the builders disallowed in other words they didn't allow that to come back they didn't allow Jesus Christ to come back in the son of man Ministry they the preachers hello somebody the same is made the head of the corner so God's going to have his group of people and a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the what at the word being disobedient now listen if you're born again your soul today you cannot be disobedient to God he can't be disobedient with himself so where is it it's in your spirit realm where you have the issues Satan can still play there stumble at the word being disobedient because what is it when we get into adoption what is adoption if you've got three children three boys the ones that are what the ones that are disobedient are not adopted the ones that are obedient are adopted so what does it come down to me and you disobeying the word of God or obeying the word of God all right we're into also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in times past were not a people in the mind of God you are the people of God of the children of God but he sure didn't look like it when you were doing your XYZ out in the world hello somebody which in times past were not a people but are now the people of God what a place what a position which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy I like that scripture First Peter 1 verse 22 we'll stop right here won't go any further see you have look now look here we go this we we're talking we talked about the soul now we're in the spirit realm got it all right Shake stuff just for a minute seeing you have purified your souls Souls that don't mean you got two Souls that means talking about everybody okay not that you got two three Souls you got one Soul either born again or not we don't we have to go over that again I don't think so see seeing you have purified your souls and obeyed how do you purify your soul and obeying the truth [Music] see that you love one another with pure heart fervently being born again now listen you have to watch that because remember you can't if you're born again in your soul you can't be born again again foreign you're perfect that soul is at Genesis 1 26 person no less but it's encapsulator or caught in time it's caught in the fall that's how horrible this fall was that we were talking about but being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by what by the word of God which liveth and biteeth forever Hebrews 5 verse 10. called of God and high priest after the order of Melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you are dull of hearing for when for the time you ought to be teachers now he's admonishing the people you shouldn't be teachers by now I'm just telling you what Paul said oh he's just talking about them what he's talking about us you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not strong meat in other words you backed up somewhere went back to drinking milk again you should be eating meat for everyone that uses milk it's white unskillful or may I put in their disobedient huh listen God's not going to adopt a child drinking milk he's only going to adopt somebody that's fully mature that eats meat I mean the meat of the word of God not just simple Doctrine everybody with me all right or you become such as having need of milk and not strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good from evil we'll get to this Wednesday night accordions here has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world oh wait a minute Paul wants to call the Revelation about Genesis 1 26. chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world Paul was a prophet remember he could see things it's like giving Clarity to write what he did and for us to be able even 2 000 years ago from there to now be able to understand what he said and it'd be clear that they weren't going through the same identical thing according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that look we should be holy and Without Blame him before him in love having predestinated looked down the line saw us come to maturity and predetermine that by his foreknowledge having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself in other words he's going to have an adopted group of people and they can't be in the sixth dimension they're already sealed away they're gone on whatever wherever each one of them were that's where they were and that's where they're going to stay right but to come to adoption means being where you can speak and write your own check that's not over there that's here there's provision made God saw he predestinated by what by four four knowledge what he saw he saw a group of people come to that yes us because if you're passed on you can't come to adoption you might could come to adoption but you're going on you're not here where you can keep going on everybody with me having predestinated us into the adoption of children now You Gotta Be You Gotta Be a child to be a doctor you got to come into the family but then you got to grow brother Brown talks about you know the Holy Ghost he goes and he he goes and he watches the child and he goes back to the father and he says hey this guy's a chip off your own of the old block or looks just like you and actors like it where he says man this guy's a rascal you sit on the front row that's what you get I mean predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to wear to himself see because we could in adoption you become so much the father to your name's good as on a checkbook and says this in other words all power and Heaven and Earth been given unto who you in adoption not just being a baby not just be no eat meat the meat of the word the seals what we're fixing to get into we're fixing to get into the seals again the seals is what literally opened this book to all of us showed us all the Mysteries and those Mysteries was about me and you according to the good pleasure of his will my brother rounds right here we'll stop let's go ahead and stand our feet now what is adoption let me get this now I don't know whether I won't have time to get through this but I'll hit it we'll have time to hit it Wednesday night then if there's a question you can ask a little later your adoption is not your birth all right your birth is at Genesis 1 26 man being put into flesh the old you burn out God coming in Vulcanizing himself to you the real you and then the real you shows whether it be of the devil or of God the real you is going to show your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing now we'll talk about that maybe Wednesday night or a little bit later because when we say placing by the way what do you mean You Know Who You Are you know why you're here you know where you're going you know why God speaks to you the way he does and not the other person because everybody's not coming to adoption not everybody is you're not going to be able to use the full word of God to your benefit and the only person that stops you is you we were predestinated unto this adoption for the sons of the last day that's us even brother Branham I didn't get to it but I'll read it Wednesday night where brother Brown stood one day on The Sixth Seal he'd preached he'd preached the seals up to up to the sixth ceiling he had questions and answers before the settlements he'll open or not you all know I've recorded many many times I had it on here he said it's gone from you in other words you have the spirit of adoption listen to me real I'm not degrading those people they came in the time they're supposed to be he said brother Brown says look you have received Christianity I have to get around here because Michael's so big you have received Christianity right he didn't de-christianize them but he said what I'm talking about this week is not for you it's for a group of people to come now he didn't say that but that's exactly if it wasn't for them it's got to be for somebody okay the word of God's Not Gonna return void when he spoke those seals something had to happen he had to be adopted number one and then he brought it to a people and then God showed him hey all these people are not going to be adopted because they're still Pentecostal they're babies there was no message churches in 1963. brother Brown was the only one that really believed what he said I'm telling you you look and say and you asked both George Smith when brother Brown died brother Banks woods and all the ones that he had spoke of Highly on the tape they went right back into their denomination Junior Jackson a couple of them you know kind of caught a little bit of it well then they went off into all kinds of stuff but that wasn't nobody that really got the Capstone or headstone message brother Ryan was talking about except another group of people which is us I just contend it's us Folk it's us he was talking about I don't know if he saw your face or my face in in that Vision but he knew that the vision he had of the people sitting in his congregation was not going to come to adoption they were not going to get it but it's for another group of people which is US amen foreign and that takes us to adoption and we'll start talking about Wednesday night but praise God we're in listen you don't get put in a group that's a good group to be put in the group that's gonna get it the group that's going to see this thing to the very end the group that look not just see it but be involved there's going to be somebody that's going to be involved with this adoption that's able to write their own check and it be exactly what God Said exactly what God was thinking he loves us even though sometimes we don't think like him but I think he really has a shout and fit when we catch a revelation of what he's already said and we say that ain't nothing but the truth and he goes that's my kids ask my kids they've grown up they've got they they adults they get in there they're eating the meat this hour is the greatest hour the greatest hour of Christianity since Jesus walked on the face of the earth is right now because it's a many-membered group of people that understood what brother Brown and brought is walking in what he said and is learning what the real word of God is and what it says because there's a lot of people don't they don't know that amen let's bow our heads just for a moment dear Lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for the for the time and opportunity and the group of people that you give us to speak to father now pray that you just be with us now and furthermore this communion service that Lord we may come in with you Lord more and more father just bless us take care of us Lord we've seen sick healed Lord May today we see sick heal the Lord is taking communion may we see Devils being cast out as the as the communion is being taken and all the things that's bothering us Lord in life that you'll take those things away Lord as as we commune with you Lord and do a service one of The Commandments that you told the disciples to do until you come we're going to get ready to do two of them Lord and we pray this you'd bless it now and just be with us Lord and furthermore this time in Jesus name amen let's go ahead and go who's doing the communion and get it ready if you've got that pulled up brother Anderson um we'll read it off the screen and you can read it with me give them time to get to communion ready we really appreciate this brother Ryan now he's Deacon and we sure appreciate him and and uh the work he's doing and we appreciate all of you appreciate the word of God that we'll be able to uh to believe it not just like I said not just leave it on the page but become it let it live let it come out and live live among us amen anybody ready Paul says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it so take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is a new testament in my blood this New Year's office you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so letting me to that bread and drink of that cup for he that eat us and drinketh some worthily eat us and drink his damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many or weak and sickly among you I mean sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with this world wow wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home let you come not together into condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come you know Paul had come to a group of people in Corinth and they were just eating and drinking and having a party and it was just like you know having a feast and having a buffet and they were drinking wine and getting drunk and all these things and he said no don't do that hey should you go do that at home all right you don't do that at home you set aside a time that we're going to take communion to understand that it's the body and blood of the Lord all right so that's what Paul was telling him and say you know we had one Pastor our first Pastor he wasn't he said you don't supposed to eat after communion so we wouldn't go out and eat that Sunday I mean that's just that was his thought and it was okay but that's not what Paul was saying he was saying reverence the communion and then whatever you got to do go home and do it right he said in a restaurant I said in order when I come when he come back he said all this in order Paul did to the Corinthians he set him in order and told him this is what you're supposed to do you're supposed to take the bread that's not made with Unholy hands and take the wine that's not made with Unholy hands and he takes it and reverence my body which you know what represent the body of the Lord is is representing each other reversing each other we're the body of the Lord he has a physical body sure but it's up there or in another dimension I don't want to say up there it's in another dimension but you and I are his body on this Earth that's why we're going to tarry just for a moment clear everything out get everything clear now listen listen to me I've heard of people not taking communion because of some little something brother Brown said clear yourself out if you have to make it right you can't break it make it right right then you go and take communion that's what he said amen then you but you better go make that right because you know what you're going to eat a little damn Nation what that's what that means if you don't continue and do what you're supposed to do because this is this is to me this is sacred but we're humans we walk in here today and we got all kind of problems you may have spoke you know to your wife Crossways or sideways or your kids or something but clear that out today and say God I'm sorry I'm human I want to take this communion because I want to commemorate you dying for me and I want to commune closer to you so I'm going to make that right over here but you better go make it right all right but take that communion all right then go make it right are you eating drink damnation and it says maybe sometimes people even sleep because of it to Heavenly Father Lord this bread we know has been made with holy hands and father we pray that you would Sanctified Lord our bodies thank you for giving us this opportunity to do this Lord and be standing in front of your people Lord the chosen from the foundation of the world that's now being manifest in a group called The Bride thank you for that father and thank you for all this that we have in Jesus name amen and just to let you know I've got the grape smashed they're in nine gallon jars nine they're in no three three gallon jars and they're working so let's pray that that communion wine we can make it like brother Dale does used to a gallon of communion wine would last us for a long time but not anymore and I praise God for that I hope we have to make one a gallon every week or every month I mean that means you're taking communion and not passing it by but you know God just gave us a few ordinances to do take communion keep yourself clean take communion foot washing and baptized in my name that's kind of pretty much all he give us those ordinances he said here if you'll do these you're good now we know there's a lot of them to go to it but he told us those were important right those were important the important ones because if you don't if you don't take communion you're not doing what the word of the Lord says like I said with water baptism and and even with the washing feet he said you do this till I come to Heavenly Father thank you for this wine Lord it's been made probably a year or more ago but it's just as good now as it was then Lauren because the holy spirit is just as good now as it was many many years ago Lord I pray that as we take these to our lips Lord that it'll refresh us and it will help us to understand Lord that you're you're not just near us you're in US and you're here Lord to heal to save Lord we have seen people healed taking this communion Lord I pray that you'd bless it Lord as it goes to our bodies Lord and sanctifies Lord for this journey as we continue on as we touch this glass Lord we remember brother Dale the one that made this and Lord the years that he stood here and had this church in order with a communion of foot washing not having to buy wine from outside and and pray over it and sanctify but made it for his own congregation from his own hands him and Mom Lord I pray that you'd bless him now touch him as we take this communion Lord that you'll go to that hospital and that you'll touch his body Lord and his mind that he'll think straight Lord and that his body will come to come under subjection Lord and not be a little agitated with the nurses or with us or anyone else Lord I pray that you would touch him Lord he stood for you now we're standing for him Lord I pray that you'd bless him in Jesus name amen come morning I'll walk by the river our rest needs he ever Greentree I will carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on good morning I'll walk by the river what a refreshing time all right I'll rest in the evergreen tree how carry my cross through the midnight but come morning there's Glory for me rest will rest I mean even when we rest now as humans we're not resting our body's going 100 miles an hour and our brain's running a thousand miles an hour about tomorrow about the next day about this about that worried about the kids worried about this worried about that but when God tells us to rest he means it brother how is at rest last time I saw him he he you could see the burdens on his face but but even laying there in in the casket he almost looked Young the burdens and the cares were away from from whatever was you know burdening his his mind and and burdening him you know being a burden to the family and and you know that weight on him remember what he did didn't he brother boy he looked he looked really refreshed even laying in the casket I know they make them up but still you can you know um somebody was here not too long ago and said they knew a mortician and a mortician they don't call them morticians anymore I don't know what they call them but Funeral Directors but a funeral director told him one time said we can so when people bring bodies in he said we can really tell whether they're Christians or not he said if you're a Christian they're just they're just everything's peaceful he said but people that screaming crying you know horrible horrible deaths he said they're all contorted and their skin is all mashed together because they're fighting when you come to the end of your time you better hope one thing's for sure you know that you know that you know you know where you're going because it would be a horrible thing if you didn't thank you brother [Music] thank you hitting there a piece being a Christian I mean sure we have struggles and trials but that there's a Prince of Peace in there somewhere you need to let him out have peaceful yourself peaceful your brother peace with the Lord let's partake God bless you let's read the scripture while they're taking that up for the put the foot washing hmm I hope my I hope the one we make as good as that for sure that is good wine I mean but you know I honestly I see when I go to places and preach and used to a good bit more than now they always would have a a bottle of wine they bought from the store because they had no way to make it they didn't know anything about making it they would buy it from the store and it's got all kind of yeast and all kinds of preservatives in it that's nothing more to what I'm making the same way what Dad made on from the same recipe that's nothing but sugar and grapes that's it the sugar makes it work then you just keep straining the grapes and then whatever the whatever that chemical reaction is we opened some up last night me and Mom didn't open some of the jars up and you can see it working you see it start bubbling I wish the Holy Ghost would work like that maybe give you a little bubble maybe somebody would do this every once in a while act like you want to be here okay natural Times Are Spiritual why do we take wine instead of grape juice grape juice sours and goes bad and ain't no telling who made it but the church is what they do is they just tell me they pray over it they get the deacons and the preachers together and they pray over the wine that they have to buy because they don't have now dad has we have never in this church since 1975 that I know of ever had to buy anyone tell you know for we never had to buy never had to go out and buy any dad and mom's always made it and we appreciate that and you think well that that's just that's just being technical no it's supposed to be made by holy hands they're supposed to be the fruit of the vine all right not the grape juice all right it needs to be made with holy hands and then I think maybe that helps you a little bit more all right so let's go to the foot washing supper being ended the devil having now put it in the heart of Judas this carrot Solomon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he was come from God boy we ought to get that revelation after today we come from God and we're going back to God all right he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel or with he was girded then cometh heed to Simon Peter and Peter saying to him Lord here's Peter Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus said what I do thou knowest not now Peter you will know Hereafter and you will institute this everywhere you go you're going to wash feet go back I'm not finished reading that other one Jesus answered and said what I do that I know it's not now but Thou shalt know her after all right you'll know Hereafter Peter said Peter couldn't wait because we said no he ain't watching my feet Jesus said if I wash thee not see this is so powerful he said if I don't wash your feet you'll have no part with me okay Simon Peter says unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said unto him he that is washed and he is not saved to wash his feet but is clean ever with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you're not all clean so after he washed their feet and taken garment will sit down again he said unto them know you what I've done to you he's asked him a question you know what I'm doing to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example in other words an ordinance I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you wow very very I'm saying to you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things you should be real happy if you do them let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this time we have Lord I pray that you would sanctify us Lord Lord through this journey I hope we've said something Lord that'll help the people Lord even in Monday morning when the devils are out trying to disrupt children of God that that would just break back the sun come out and Lord you just shine on their life and give them a good week I pray that you'd bless us now and sanctify us Lord as we go and wash feet Lord this other continuation of an ordinance and that you would bless each one Lord that truly we're washing your feet because we're the body of Christ I pray that you'd bless each one now take care of us until we come back together Lord as one to you and wins tonight Lord and next Sunday move brother gadman Lord and bless him father in Bible study and all the things that we do Lord we we want to do them and
