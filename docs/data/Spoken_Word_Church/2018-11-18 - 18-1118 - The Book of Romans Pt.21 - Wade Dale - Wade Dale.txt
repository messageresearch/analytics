TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning see here okay don't tell you well I'll see some of you choose do not delay that and we'll see when you get back yum only with our minds leaving going somewhere so I think I'm gonna go then get the woods not some dealers you you jeering comin or not so young you know 66 to 27 they played to be tame and people out the stands right quarter alright so let's get started here so we were on new Romans 10 fade away I know but let's go back up to verse 17 and kind of lap over and see what we got to pick this up yup do something what Paul has told us and then when we start the next chapter it'll kind of be a lap over back to back to what we're talking about so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God all right remembers in the hearing it's not in the speeding is in the hearing think cometh by hearing okay but I say have they not heard yes barely their sound went into all the earth and though urghhh unto the ends of the world but I say did not Israel know first Moses says I will provoke you to jealousy by them there are no people and by a foolish nation I will anger you somebody but Isaiah all right say he says it's very bold and says I was found of them that sought me 9 I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me now what's he talking about here I was found by them they sought me not Gentiles Paul saying that God's because remember back the people who come back not all the intervals Israel and then he's returning I'm reading in the book of Acts now I'm going back through the New Testament reading the book of Acts where pulse is low we turn to the Gentiles why because Israel he was preaching in Jerusalem and that was thrown and him throwing him out gonna kill him so he said I'm going to Gentile all right which is what he was supposed to do anyway remember Peter opened the door but Paul went in and did the preaching Peter opened the door but following in and do the preaching because they Peter had the keys of the kingdom he can unlock and he unlocked the door to the Gentile but Paul went on in to preach to the Gentiles and I guess inside of itself that really hurt him because he was a Jew but he knew he had persecuted the Jews he was accused of the law you know making them blasphemy putting them to death and all those things he was praying and hoping that his people the Gentiles would come on in I mean the Jews would come on in but then he keeps seeing the door being closed again by the by the Jews so the Gentiles I was found of them that stopped me not the Gentile can't help didn't care about garden they had no promise the Jews had a promise all the way back he's talking like Moses but that what they went to them it was to the lost sheep of the house of Israel but Israel turn down went whoring God had to what God had to divorce her put her away so he can manage in top right I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me like saying nobody knew even a third a third of a third of a third of the people knew who Jesus was and then the Jews knew who was but never really knew who it was that's right but to Israel he said all day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people God do that but he's long-suffering he has grace he knew what was gonna happen that's what I was thinking the other day we heading down the road about 90 were asleep so I was thinking a little bit so I was thinking well I was driving but you know that's done you ever been of this why did he just stop it and walk it off no he had to let the plan of God go the way he saw it go because he wouldn't be gotten in and got in that way then he wouldn't be gone he'd be a dictator he started a that's why I believe in predestination do I do with foreknowledge and you have something to do with it you have actually everything to do with okay yes all day long now stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people Nate's talking about who here Gentiles is talking about the Jews here Israel oh that long that stretched forth my hand so now watch I say then this is probably in the left chapter 11 he's continuing his talk I say then hath God cast away his people god forbid now what Paul said he hasn't totally forsaken the Jews he's always going to have them there they're always going to be his people he can't let's just put it this way God can divorce Israel for whoring against him put her away but she's still there okay physically same way with any of us if you have a living spouse then you understand what I'm saying yeah the law of managing force is pretty plain but we do we know we do that grace okay and God that grace because you didn't just cast it now she'll never be wife again you can't take you out back once you've been defiled by somebody else you can't take her but we can't take her back his wife but he takes her back is what the nation of Israel the children of God according to Moses in the Old Testament everybody got that so Israel is not completely camps now I mean man if I was God and I heard Israel say let his blood be on us and our children I that be it I never think of them again okay right that's what I said we never come up with grace God come up with the word grace we did we don't have great we have to acquire grace we have to see grace at work and we do see it at work with us gun violence God and say hey if you're gonna do this you're going I'll just find me somebody else but Noah always tell them they'll be servants they'll be there will be millions of them ending and not in the new city but in the new earth there will be millions and millions of Jews okay from the Old Testament all right have God cast away his people god forbid for I also AM an Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin so he knew his land he was from the tribe of Benjamin God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew because remember not all Israel Israel not everybody in the Old Testament is gonna be in heaven that's right that's not an automatic process dog knows their what their heart he knows their heart and one their heart like David while looking graves I mean we're fixing to start on the fifth seal maybe not to you Steve but next week I'm not going to buy the whole piece because I got a working bunch for the post office so I'm going to be on that Sunday - but when we get a fifth seal you gonna see grace given to people that don't want it well mine we didn't want it we didn't want it and Israel turned it down right right so I mean you know grace is what brings them in and let his blood be on us in our job and now remember brother Brown said God God didn't forget that that's why they've been persecuted now for 2,000 years and during the Gentile time look at Israel if I wants to kill Israel the nation of Israel whatever mind wants them out of here but they sustain because what they're still God's people that's right my reason said I can't have become a Jew I appointed you I'm God's people God's one that told us that we were Jews and we could do this listening but there under the Old Testament because they don't believe Christ have done away with it's not going away with all but magnified it made an audible though I have not cast away his people which he foreknew like said look at David look at grace here's David know me and you take the rap sheet you don't want to write you this when somebody commits a crime or a crime alone you go and you pull his rap sheet it says in 1974 he did this in 1983 he stole a car nothing a that's a rap sheet David's rap sheet to me it's horrible horrible I mean he took his best friend I mean the guy that wouldn't even go to his wife he stayed right there at the gate just in case David needed him to go do something and then David sees his wife on the housetop taking a bath and he goes and has relations with her then he comes and tells the army the captain of the army I wonder what that captain thought about day because he knew what he was doing he said when the battle is hot everybody just pulled back and leave your eye out there well man that's murder that's premeditated murder he could get that was capital murder he could get the death penalty in this in this era that we're living in he get the death penalty that's right but he had a profit on the same and said David you're a man after my own heart God said and then Nathan comes in and says David you'll not die yes what we haven't had will probably come in to tell us the same thing because we are all murders analyzed from cheats and thieves and everything else maybe not naturally but spiritually it was that way and then we have a prophet come in and announce see if we ever see that there's our body change Nathan's didn't David that weren't the man but you're not gonna die if we take that those days that we're not gonna die but it's not an automatic process would you know what the scripture says they'll be lies rely John how do you make the intercession to guard against Israel saying Lord they have killed my prophets and digged down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life this is truly was that the other day but what says the answer have gone into him here's the live just saying Lord I'm the only one there's nobody else preaching it like I'm preaching it but once that dancer of God I have reserved to myself seven thousand minutes you don't know of who have not bowed the knee to the image of bail even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace was Paul saying if you'll remember I'm reading in the book of Acts now I'm telling you the apostles of Jesus met a group of people that were preaching in the name of Jesus in preaching that Jesus was the Christ that wasn't a part of their little group one will need to be so groupie there's other people preaching it may be apparent to you but there was a group coming you know what what did it was the Peter and one of them said Lord this while Jesus was still here said Lord what I'm gonna need to do he said don't fight against yourself leave them alone in other words in this one then you got somebody like you seeing that swear think of us comes in activist with the profit that you don't hear nothing about except a little a little bit in the book of Acts you hear about activist and he came in and prophesied but he was a prophet anyone's property gone until the Bible said in full holy oh yes all right so if sometimes we narrow we've some narrow-minded we my brother brown said was so narrow-minded we put a lead pencil between err between our nose and hip both eyes brother brown said that there's a quote I have it in my house and yet by grace there's a remnant according to the election of grace and it's by grace then it is no more of work now watch this is otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then is it not more grace otherwise work it's no more work all right so what because this is the contention that people have with James that you're saved by your work hmm okay then Paul saying if it's anything to do with works it's no great this man but then brother branham I believe him when he preached wisdom versus faith and then he preached works his faith Express so that's what really Paul's saying Paul saying look if you see grace it wasn't something you did right but once you get grace to me it's all that you do because if you don't it's greasy grace you just keep them no you don't keep on doing once you see grace like we're gonna talk about that fifth seal once you see grace and you see amazing grace then you you turn from whatever because what it is what's great grace is unmerited favor so you didn't merit anything to get to that position but once you get to that position you do have something to do with it cuz if you're not if you keep doing what you're doing that's crazy grace that's what we get into with all these people in the mess you you think they're so regulated that they can do whatever they won't do now because you know the random lamb or a Rams eighth day or it's just it's just less than the flesh is what it did and there is no grace that's greasy grapes I don't believe them greasy grace but I do believe in grace grace was extended to David grace was extended to the pastor Ramsey where the Lord took him home when he went out and started drinking beer you know God took him home to Nick Martin that was great right that was a grace of dog it did that that's why I said there is no way man could come up with grace there's no way man you and I are so judgmental and we're so we have opinion and non opinion and this we just can't see grace until we come to God I think you see grace and like I said it's not well it's the grace we can do Mary wanted no grace allows you to make mistakes but grace doesn't allow you to continue making that same mistake over and over again because like the brother Ramsey he was continuing to make that mistake in God dissing ours that's it I'm taking you home of course he did brother Ramsey a favor right I'm taking him on home right could have got work she's never done now watch Paul trying saying you got to watch who he's talking to these Tom's in the room when she's talking to Israel he's talking to the people in Jerusalem who have it's been works since Moses because they took that as a book through the book of works the 10 commandments thou shalt not thou shalt not thou shalt not and in Jesus comes along and said ok you didn't touch her but if you left it after in your line you committed adultery with her already or you're accused of committing adultery with her already in your heart and then you think God forgive me and there's grace but 10 years ago because we remember even Paul would walk into a synagogue and boy think about Paul walking into a synagogue the people he was there friends at one time he was back here with the Sanhedrin and back here with the Pharisees and Sadducees right all right now he's over here totally opposite the point he was before and they're over here going why do we have to listen to you you were over here one day and you were persecuting that's my Paul had to spend all this time showing his conversion yes remember he went to a Griffin went through the whole conversion he went through the conversion twice now that God made him on the road I read that in the book of I read of a black axe is really a good book because it's the Acts of the Apostles and that should be that should be the we always saw that faith of the fathers read the book like I told the church up there in Kentucky F it's really simple if you want to know the Acts of the Son of Man read Matthew Mark Luke and John and when the Son of Man will go to the Son of God in acts and read the book of Acts and that's now the faith of the father started that's the foundation of of the Gentile dispensation of God working the Son of God working through the church ages there's your book back so you got them right there this on a man in Matthew Mark Luke and John and you got the book of Acts and son of God starting to work in the people so it's really the faith of the father there's working in the people cuz really watch what happens in in acts magmar Luke and John tell the story of a life okay Jesus and all the disciples then he got the book of Acts it brings all those disciples together take Jesus out so some man's gone missing this this will help you that son of man is out well the son of God came back on a day that comes back on their Pentecost acts to into believers and then they start acting like Christians but now you get into Romans and all Corinthians what it is it's kind of everybody scattered then Romans Paul by the letters of this one Peters write the letter this one and it's really no more commentary of how they live is talking to he's talking to the Romans he goes with content and talks to the Corinthians and the Corinthians didn't get it the first time so he went back again that's why you got a first Corinthians in the second grade then you got Timothy and all those ones then you got John in the Book of Revelations you got he's not telling them he's sure he's telling but he's telling something didn't happen when Jesus was here and it didn't happen during the first part of the faith of the fathers so if you want to know what to pay some fathers is there she book look like we're gonna know what the Son of Man does read that but if you want to know how the church was built read Romans grant ends Timothy all those is how the church was built up and say and that's what calls talking about now if you'll if you'll separate that then you go to the very end of the book of revelations and see that's all future event so pick something coming you know something's coming here comes remember the church ages yeah it started back when Paul came but when when John when Jesus came to John on Patmos the first church age had just been started the other Church ages hadn't even started yet they didn't live it out so let's get back to our I thought what that Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election has obtained it and the rest were blinded oh I'm sorry go back any by grace then there's no more of work because it's not do's and don'ts like I said it's not a laundry list of the things that you did or didn't do now grace covers that but then by your works you show that grace has come by your works you show that grace has come you don't get grace for a future event you get grace for what you did are doing amen but then our works that you go over the book of James and then like said brother man preach works his faith expressed faith is your grace because remember what do you got to have faith in you gotta have faith in God that grace is all God not not not any human that graces of God so I have to have faith come that listen honestly come on how do we know that God forgets our sins oh yeah the problem tells us I'll tell us a lot of things but how do we really know God is forgive you of your past because you know what you still think about it all the time right all the time we thinking about it but that's in your outside realm or that middle realm that's not in your soul yes baby called if God resides there there's no memories and conscience patient imagination of anything you've done except be the Word made flesh right yeah hey man so then this part out here to me and we'll get into it maybe later on after the seal don't want to do home a little thing on the on the spirit realm but then that's where Satan works but that's where God works to the nth they interlock inside there that's what the great battle is but what we got to do is it great with me this intimacy this isn't working right so I've got to believe that God don't remember though I keep saying God forgive me face and he's off what are you talking about and you know what he's honest when he says that he don't know those fast then why because he's hidden that inside man he is that inside man he ain't in the inside man boy you're saying to people in Kentucky when I told them that most people in this message were we're Tunis but they agreed once I gave them the the analogy of will Jesus is over here and one over here that he's gonna do this and I I can't do that well where air is enjoying air so I think we we were gonna start believe have to believe it with that if he's in us he can do anything he did while he was manning here on earth plus create world and everything else there's one it's really saying I think also the fact that that's because it's the one in you that caused you to repent turn on that correct gives you the assurance that that God you know God is like I don't see it because it was him him through me you know that that right so sure but it burns all that out so you got it that's why we gotta believe we gotta have faith then that what's inside of us it's perfect right right it don't need girth it is good that's right it don't need great yo result no Jesus didn't need great right so if we get what he gets he didn't need grace Michael he's got all mighty body spirit and soul but grace comes to us to our memories and conscience facts and imagination and helps us because at one point in this fall yeah going at one point you would have done the same thing back in the world you and I have not felt anything to go ahead and bring out stuff for that Glenn's right but it then oh sudden that comes in you know that's God then well why brother Brown said that's your top up you go back to that top post you put that top folks down and you said hey Satan right here I gave this thing up you bring it back all you want but right here is where my top post okay so it's not about works then it's by grace but your works is your faith expressed I live it like like release is saying I live it because I see how awesome grace is then he has forgive me of everything and I see the awesomeness that God's trying to tell us even now who we are not what we're coming to but who we are already cuz that makes the tunas work we're doing this we're separate and say well Jesus is here and we're here no he's right here he's the same person [Music] was God and Jesus being two different people in there that's right but see that's out there the nominations see that in the message we know that's not right that's the deception we know that's not right but we still think we're let's do this in the message I'm not saying tune is out there if you caught by tunas out there you need the new birth right I'm talking about in the message we have come to this thinking is that Jesus is doing this and we're doing this no no it's let me a mass a message Tunis because we know better in the Trinity we know better being the one that's which is one life you finger could you know what if you got if you're a oneness then we're counted out because the bride is the last form of God they say Jesus is the life form of time that's really your one that's doctrine that Jesus was it and we're nothing else well by me being on this earth I have busted that theory out and then we don't we don't believe that we got three of them standing up there so when you come back to come back to them the message that we really are feeling that that we've not come to a place for where we make died yet or met Jesus yet because so I told them I've been can't I gotta tell you to two words will kill you but I preach you'll say something and you'll come to place and then in your mind you go but I what your victim just give a circumstance but I but on what God don't have a but I young town what I mean we go but I you know you try to continue what God put a period in sit look you're the chosen of God you're hearing your commission to take a body chain and you know what it's all of grace okay I can't work myself into a body chain but if I have if I see enough grace for the middle man Colette for you grace you need grace you don't need grace for you flash the flash was trash I'm getting it getting some of those quotes together where brother Ramsey were trapped into it we weren't we were trapped in this we came because of the same between item and even the beast and all those things that went on this is our track yes then he comes like I said before my favorite quote Jesus did not come to bring you your inheritance remember I read that to them too now give them over a lot to think about it then Kentucky but I read the quote brother Brown said Jesus didn't bring you your inheritance your inheritance was before the foundation of the world back up there in the mind of God creating the world that give us is 1:26 man if you had a beginning you're gonna have anything evening alright so we come to a place to where we always want eternal that part that's inside but then we got to work on the next guy the next guys knew we gotta work on not this guy not the metal guy that's it you work on that middle and that memory reason content specs and imagination we gotta go what that Israel have not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded so Israel was blinded according to who's written God had given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should have not seen him as they should not hear unto this day unto this day what Paul's talking about up to this day all right so we'll stop right there and we'll continue like I said will continue next next time they'll or glitter [Music]
