========================================

me Faith uh give you a little update on uh my procedure I had done what three weeks ago now uh after the procedure was done I'm in recovery and uh this guy he comes he pulls the curtain back introduces himself of course I don't remember his name and he starts telling me the possible options that I have putting stance in you know I'm like okay you know like brother Tom said got to go along with a program but uh anyway I'm laying there and uh after what I've been through to lay still 4 hours without moving is a very very hard thing to do and uh anyway I'm laying there and my son Jacob he went with me and he's sitting out there with me and we talking and 4 hours a long time to think you know you laying still well you got a lot to think about anyway yeah and uh laying still is harder than the procedure itself I'm laying there thinking well you know after everything this man has told me that's not what I asked for right that's not what I ask you to ask well I get home I tell Jo she said well okay they'll let us know so uh usually when there's something wrong they're going to call you and let you know all this is what we got to do when we got to do it right right and uh well about a week passed well first of all brother Dale call me how everything go well we didn't get what we necessarily asked for what does he say Keep On Believing every time what It Go Keep On Believing let's believe and he knows me I'm going to believe amen so Brother Dean calls I tell him uh basically the first thing comes out of his mouth is that lion stinking devil that is not that is not what we prayed about I said amen we didn't right so uh anyway Jo when she starts investigating she goes all out so she calls these people hey it's been a week why Haven we heard from you well we nothing really nothing to say we're going to mail you copy the report but he was told well she's told what his nurse Karen talk to Danny trust me this guy didn't look like no caring that come in and talk to me and anyway uh she tells me well Karen told you no Karen didn't are you sure yeah back and forth with that no she did not this guy pulled the curtain open tells me what we got to do are my options and is it hard to get off work and no well all right that's good well then we'll get in touch with you well nobody's got in touch with me until she gets in touch with them and they tell her doctor says it cannot get any better than what they what they plan so she called him back to let them know that Karen did not talk to Dan so anyway Here's the final word from uh Dr Daniel bar himself Angel gram looks good very stable no further treatment will repeat the angel gram once again in five years so when the devil throws you a curb you know a good hitter is going to stand up there if that if that curve ball hangs up there just right it's over it's over the fence and U that's right me Faith I believe and thank you for believing with me amen the Lord used the doctors yeah but we know who

to us amen yes sir praise the Lord so if you got your Bibles we going just take a little simple thought this evening appreciate Brother Sam and having us come down and fellowship with you and it's good to see everyone here and everything and uh I'm going to go right to the word of God uh so let us turn our Bibles to the book of Ephesians the fourth chapter you already got it up there and I'm going to read from it right there cuz it's a lot easier on my eyes one thing about when you get one thing about this is this will work real good yeah 53 man I tell you what I'm trying to keep them out to I got glasses I quit wearing them I said more wear them the more my eyes dependent on it so I said I'm going to quit wearing them because when I get old I want to be wearing them that thick yeah I better quit now cuz every time I went to the doctor they say you need to add a little more I said by the time I get 55 or 60 they're going to be like this I said no way I says I just stop it says he said there is one body and one Spirit right so if any Revelation produces more than one spirit is the wrong Revelation one Spirit even as ye are called in one ho of your calling one Lord I don't know where the two Lord idea come up from one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all that got to answer the question amen next uh the N Philippians third chapter and it use this it says here Philippians 3 3rd Chapter verse three we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit so we know it ain't but one Spirit right one God right and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh that's B oh Father I trust you right now Lord help me one more time to yeld my body my mind my spirit my soul to you God father I trust God right now you give us strength to finish this service father now father I commit myself to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated one moment thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this evening one Lord One Faith one baptism that's in you all that's with you all and through you all hallu I went to the scripture I'm going to take a title on One Faith to expose Satan with right in other way if you got a revelation and if you ain't if it ain't exposing Satan you got a wrong Revelation cuz Revelation was given to the bride to bring a power over the devil how to expose Satan and everyone his techniques so that what we want to talk about one Faith to expose the devil with and I begin to realize as I talking them thing because I begin to realize it take real Revelation to fight against the power of Darkness how we all try we all we talk about faith and I thought people talk about faith but when it come down to facing the devil with it they throw up their hand and surrender how they begin to say I'm not able to do this I cannot I can not uh it's too much for me to H but that I want you to ask your question how long did it take you to find out it was too much for you to H that why you had to depend on God how if he know that you can H it you wouldn't need to depend on him so we begin to look at these things and we begin to look at it so God we want to talk about faith now we realize the prophet taught levels of Faith right y when of you I'm going to read a quote out the out the Blasphemous name and he begin to talk about I think page 22 right now 23 it says then he begin to talk on blaspheming and he begin to talk about faith he said the and the biggest part of our faith is mental Faith mental faith faith that brought you here today that you got up this morning you was able to go and sit down at the table eat your food you didn't think about it you was able to get in your car and drive it to church you didn't think about it in other words you know you know we we got mental faith and he says here is this my water y thanks there this morning it wouldn't mou somebody drunk out of it no I wasn't I done been there and done that I told him I said we was one time I was in a country I said I was in Uganda and I we it was it was six of us in the motel when I got up in the morning I noticed everybody coming out the bathroom they doing I said wonder why they about wiping their mouth but I was laying in the bed looking when I got up my toothbrush were dripping that ANW the question I shouldn't have told my wife about she wouldn't kiss me for a year that's the way it go it's the truth in way that's right but hey you know brother say we got to be so close we can chew each other chair and go I just want chew it first amen you know it just that way now you know I mean we we by God grace but we know that one Faith one body one bride Hallelujah so here we have he said the biggest part of our faith is mental Faith right you must have you must you must have this mental faith in other word order even to operate in the laws of this the law itself you must have this man of faithly then he goes and says hearing the word bring bring us to a mental reconciliation of God but if this this come from above oh brother if it scrats this heart and then there is is a Godly spiritual of faith our men of faith become a spiritual faith and up on the foundation or Revelation I will build my church right GL and when that screen of Grace is pulled into that mental faith that give you got then up on wait then you got them upon this a spiritual Revelation I will build my church in other words he begin to take it to the level he said up on this spiritual Revelation is what the devil going to be defeated at H and other words we going to begin to realize here this mental faith that we got we got to do one thing with it you said what can I do with my Al faith I tell you what you need to do with it if we can all get it to drop 18 Ines if you could get if you can get yourself out the way just to get your mle faith to drop 18 inches it'll be a supernatural Faith so I get to look it up excuse me as I begin to look at this here I want to deal with well you know we we talk about mental faith we need to find it in the scripture how can we talk on mental faith Fai and not have scripture to produce M of faith hallu if there a ment of Faith there got to be a scripture to produce mental faith and there got to be scripture to produce Supernatural Faith so now I want to look at a mental faith in the book of in the book of First Corinthians 13 I want to look read the scripture 1 Corinthians 13 verse 2 look at this fa Paul talking about real this is a powerful favor he can pull that First Corinthians 13th chapter verse 2 if he can pull that up then I'll read that real quick but I want you to realize here that if we don't get to read it out the Bible Paul said it here he says and though I have the gift of Prophecy right and understand all Mysteries now a go right here now praise God he said pa me here that what ver I read verse two yeah verse two he said though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all mystery it's seen it though if we understand the mystery we got power over the devil that don't mean nothing to the devil that mean that you can read and grab for knowledge H that mean that I can come to the first six seal and not be born again Hallelujah understand all mry and all knowledge and though I have what all yeah yeah all faith that look good that all Faith you said if I got all Faith that's all I need he said do I have all Faith so that I can remove mountains and have not what I am nothing so he did P here all this right here is no good without charity and we know that Christ is Charity H and what so Paul let us understand without Christ I'm nothing that's right I don't care how much mle Faith you got you must be born again Hallelujah outside of being born again you have no power over the devil you have no power over circumstances you must have Supernatural Faith that's that's mental Faith he talk about let's just talk about let's just look at what Paul talk about supernatural Faith Galatians 2 and verse 20 the book of Galatians 2 and verse 20 he find that for us real quick I'm going to use that one too because here's two levels of faith I'm dealing with Paul talking about mental Faith here I got it I can move mountains I got faith though I can understand Mysteries I can have all this and I'm nothing so Paul had to bring us to the Revelation here H this is another realm of Faith Paul talking about right here if you notice here Paul talk about another realm of Faith how that other faith I can move Mountain I can understand all the mystery Hallelujah I can have prophecy I got all knowledge and I'm nothing but Paul come to Galatians 2 chapter at verse 20 he said I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live but then he goes and say no am minute I don't want to put i in it let me take myself out of him he said but not yet not I but Christ liveth in me that's what the power of Faith he said Christ live in me and the life which I now live in the what I live by the favor of w hallah by the favor of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Paul said this life right here this fi right here it will move the devil HL not just a mental conception not just a ment of Faith but Ain life of God living on the inside of me that's the fa I'm talking about of faith when the devil see you walking the devil know who you are H you don't even have to pray all your Shadow got to do is get around it h demons know the life right H the demon don't care demon don't care how religious you are oh yeah he said Satan and the rising of the sun he said Satan okay I'll write you all your Doctrine he said but if you miss that life if you miss that life he know that you would not come up in way because it going to take one Spirit One Faith to raise you out of the grave and that same faith that rais Christ from the dead if it dwell in your mortal body it will bring you out of the grave all right the begin look here let's take your ball begin here so we talking about mental faith and other way we talking about Revelation Faith Supernatural faith and know where we trying to find out how to tap into this real how because really and know where Satan is there too many people to beat down and they begin to look here brother what can I do I'm trying to build my faith I'm trying to work more I'm trying to study more how I'm trying to get how did brother say you can study too much he said people have a nervous breakdown trying to study H what you need to do and say Lord help me to give true Revelation help me to get born again so I can see Christ in the scripture H study ain't going to give you the Holy Ghost HJ but if you ever get born again H then he'll make the scripture live through you H that's what we trying to do so we begin to go here we got to deal with this thing because see we want to expose demons and God give you Revelation to give you power over Devils that mean power of depression power over high blood pressure power over sugar diabetes I'm saying power over the gates of the hell the Gates of Hell may come against you he said but the gates of hell like that brother was testifying up he said the gates of hell was coming against you but the Gates of Hell shall not be able to overcome true Revelation H true Revelation by the devil Hallelujah and in word we need a power that we can overcome the devil cuz the devil fights too revelation is Supernatural right do you realize Revelation is a supernatural a supernatural experience with God divine revelation from God is Supernatural but also Satan demon of towers of Doubt is Supernatural Hallelujah so you f Faith one me but you got Supernatural Demons of Doubt right so every time Faith go out doubt attack you oh yeah H what to try to try your faith see when you hold to the promise because only thing that's Supernatural is God's word and God's word must be reflect in heaven and on Earth the same way right you can't have one Revelation that's not in heaven if you got Revelation on Earth it must be reflected in heaven how we told Peter he said Peter he said I know who the man said I am he was dealing with Revelation Faith but Peter had this Faith right here H Faith a true Revelation faith that God gave Peter and the Gates of Hell will not taken out of him right even though Peter you said Peter denied Jesus he should have right Peter couldn't have him deny Jesus you understand the man done what Jesus told me he going to do how before the conqu you going to deny me how he didn't deny him by self will he denied because j a prophesy he would deny if Peter wouldn't deny him what Jesus said something that he don't know the beginning from the end he knew that Peter would deny how why because Jesus had to go to Calvary by himself he had to die for the sins of the world it was not Jesus and Peter it was Jesus Christ himself self he knew that there but the point of it is but this Revelation Peter had he wanted Peter to understand he said this Revelation Peter he said your Revelation here he said the Gates of Hell going to fight against you and the Gates of Hell going to be against you Peter all the time but Peter but I want to let you know one but the gangs of Hell shall not be able H I don't care what power this devil you I don't care how much doubt he TR your mind that Gates of Hell shall not be able to overcome you Peter by faith in Revelation you see what I'm saying the Gates of Hell could separate Peter cuz when they was challenged with a spirit of Doubt right they were challenge a demon of Doubt walked in jesus' Ministry why Jesus was walking with his disciple a demon of Doubt was walking too hallah a demon of Doubt was fighting just as much as Faith was fighting so the disciples they as they walking here before Jesus here they was they see these miracles of Jesus they see all these things right here and this demon of Doubt standing there and the Pharisees saw these things why you think when Nicodemus come Nicodemus said we know right H it was not that the devil didn't know he said we know that th man come from God for no man can do these Miracle except God be with but Jesus said don't you worry about miracles you worry about the life of God on the inside of you he never said one thing about the first pull or the second P he went to the Third pull the word he said to them you must be born again I I don't care how many Miracle you see except you born again only way the devil can't Prevail over you it's by the new birth so we begin to deal with these things here so Peter didn't walk with now I want you to notice here St John 6 chapter let me start right the 64th verse down to the 6769 uh St John me look at it here real quick St John the 6th chapter here they was walking right here and this demon of Doubt was just as strong in the midst of Jesus as their faith was they walked with his word and they seen these Great Signs they seen these great signs and wonders and you thought that because the people see Great Signs and W I like something I talked to a while back I was up at the brother brother Ronny cobs Ronnie uh cops no Gary cops excuse me and he was up there that's Charlie cop's son and me and him was fellowshipping together and he was telling me about these Miracles he saw with brother Brandon he said remember brother said those little young boys were getting up giving their seats to the older people that he was one of them young boys he was at that time he was 11 to 12 years old he was sitting there and he said brother Brandon come on and the young guy would get up and let the elderly held their seats and they'll stand there but by them doing that it gave them the opportunity to come and sit down on the around the wall right at the front and brother Gary told me said brother he said you talking about miror he said I seen things I seen people get out of wheelchairs he said I'm setting there Whoa man they can't be but he said brother out of all the Miracles I saw and all the signs and wonders I saw sat there he did not give me a new birth right he I had to go out and find God for myself and be born again by the spirit those miracles did not do one it didn't keep it from drinking it didn't keep him from acting like the world he had to come to a revelation I need to have Christ on the inside of me not just walking with me but on the inside of me Hallelujah so he goes and says these days and these guys right here watch this demon and doubt to follow this ministry let me see Jesus speaking here let me start 63rd verse St John 6 chapter 63rd verse he goes here because you remember I say have no confidence in the flesh so Jesus teaching them this in other words he trying to teach us the reason we can't get nothing from God cuz we we always think we helping it oh yeah if you can help God don't need your help he don't need you to try to help his promise he need you to get out of the way so he can do it promise how long your flesh in the way that was the hindering part how because we always feel like look what I done what you done got in the way H the soon the more you learn how to get out of the way the more you'll see God he said it is the spirit that Quicken the flesh propit what that's right that's right nothing from nothing what okay so we got that point there the flesh Prophet nothing but the words that I speak unto you they are what and what so power is in the word Not In the Flesh in the word the flesh ain't got nothing to do with it it's the word that's in control it's the power of faith in the word what move the devil then he goes and says here watch this demon of doubt that was following his Revival Jesus been the word he Discerning the spirit he see the dark clouds of Doubt over those guys so here he is he said there are some of you that believe not so there was another Supernatural presence in their midst there was another Supernatural move that was moving Fai was moving but also Satan was moving what was he doing he was creating doubt in their mind trying to create doubt in their faith how trying to make them walk away from the word and that what people do when the word come on the SE say come here they try to put doubt in How could a clow be there how can this happen it a I don't need to know how I need to believe that it happened exactly Glory yes sir Hallelujah and the Bible say and Jesus knew because the word always have power over the devil the devil's not pulling nothing over on Jesus Hallelujah he said and Jesus knew from the beginning what did from the beginning what beginning he knew from the attribute that Satan had in heaven he knew when he was on Earth he going to be doing the same thing putting doubt in him how he knew from the beginning who they were that believe not who shall betray him so Judas was not no mistress here he knew that the devil was walking in skin just like he was in skin and then he said here and he said and he said therefore I say unto you yeah therefore I say unto you that no man can come except it was given unto him of my father in other way if you wouldn't in him you come to him if I come from God I go back in God hallelujah he said no man can put himself in there you can't work your way in there you was already in there Hallelujah Jesus said and then he goes to here he said and then as he said these words look like that he was letting them know what was he doing he separating the she he he was separate the demon of Doubt with pulling those death that was not ordained to be in him they were going to soon show their colors they had seen ceiling they had seen them they have been there for the fishing low they seen the Revival and all of a sudden he come down to the word and then and from that time from that time right from that time right 666 from that time right from that time many of his disciples went back many of his disciples went back and walked no what with who if you don't walk with him then you walk in the darkness cuz he said walk in the light as he in the light and if you walking in the light you are forgiven and you cleansed from all UNR all if the light but if you ain't walking no more with him you have to be in darkness huah and what no more be eternally separated from God he scrapped their name of the book and then he Jesus said unto the 12 will you also go so now he testing a revelation cuz now when people normally walk away and people get upset in the church and all of a sudden the church is Le H oh hey everybody well everybody else going I ain't got nothing to do with everybody I don't come to church for everybody else I come to church for me and God hallelujah I come to hear the word hey don't matter what everybody else do I'm coming to hear the word of God hallelujah everybody know me follow the crowd right everybody else leaving so Jesus said all right I'm going to give you the opportunity to walk away like the rest of the crowd and then Jesus said unto the 12 will you also go you just hanging around for the same purpose you hanging around because you see me raised the dead healed the sick Hallelujah did you hang around because you seen the fish R I fed all you people that why you hanging around me no wor if you hang around me for that you might well go with the other crowd H then he Simon Peter being there he got stirred up H it was not the it was not it was not the gifts that was holding Peter it was the word hallah Peter he might have made a mistake but one thing he did he didn't Le the word amen and Peter and Sim Peter as said Lord one Lord y he come to he realiz his lordship he said Lord who shall we go not that has the words of what Glory so his heart was not set on sign his heart was not set on Miracle his heart was set on the word of life and he said who shall we go that has the words of eternal life and what that's what we come for we come to here not to see a show we come to hear the word of eternal life because we know that what got power over the devil right that's right and and he said and we believe in our sure that now the Christ the son of the Living God so Peter testifying he's testifying we believe and we are sure that th the Son of God I use this last and Jesus said wait a minute cuz when you bless something but say curses on somebody you better not go pray it off of them right right that why when I go to prayer for somebody I ask you made it right with God if I'm going to deal with a demon I want to make sure if you're not paying TI don't come over and ask me to pray for you right cuz I'm not going to pray that curse off of you cuz I didn't put it on you you put it on yourself hallah so don't come ask me to pray at all if you Cur because you don't pay TI don't ask me to pray it off of you you just deal with God you going to make it right with God stop pay your TI and offer it then God will bless you don't ask me to pray that devil off of you you're a thief so let me leave that little but the truth anyway and not apologize for because the word of God so here go Peter he praying and he pray he using he blessing them because that is what Abraham do his his compy is to bless them how so he said we are we believe and we are sure but Jesus knew that all of he knew that it was a devil in the midst of it and Jes I said have not I chosen you 12 y why he would not permit Peter to bless the devil right and God won't permit you to permit you to bless a devil cuz we didn't come to bless demon we come to cast them out how he would not permit Peter to put a blessing on Judah he had not I CH you one had not I chose you and one of you is a what devil a devil what he trying to tell you one of you is eternally separated from God right that what he was telling fa he know we go and we speak these in the Bible say he spoke of Judah is so he re not only did he call him a devil he revealed the name y right if you know not only did he called his name a devil he revealed who it was how did Judah he spoke up Judah is which was the mystery of Satan revealed how do show me we want to deal with a little bit more I'm not going to be here real long today God but I want you to just get a we just want to just hit on faith for a few minute because we we got people today just trying to get Faith and trying to get it the wrong way right right people want to see something if I can see something I can believe it if you can see something you don't need faith faith is not based on what you see faith based on what you believe how you how you know going to be a Rapture because something on the inside of me got a pull from the other real I can't explain the Rapture but I know there going to be a Rapture I can tell you there's a power that could been translating us from one place to the next I don't know what call them things in the world to drop off I don't know what call my desire to change I can't explain it all I know it dropped off that's a another Power pulling you didn't quit drinking and smoking and lay down drugs on your own but there was a power on the inside to the Rapture pulling you through it Hallelujah let let me you said we're trying you said but I need to find an answer we need an answer we need an answer Lord how do I get this Faith to work how do I get to a demon see I'm let's see Faith was given to keep you not you keep it right God didn't give you Faith to keep it cuz happens the time we get you know everybody get a little little film grow over your eye at times but that faith that was put there is to keep you from getting your name scratched off how why the devil can't do God put a faith of Revelation in you that the devil can't move your name right cuz he could we all probably in by now you said let me show you you said what you trying to say I'm talking about we not talking about in let your faith now we talking about this faith that Paul talked about the life that I now live is by the faith of the Son of God and God ain't never lost the battle right Hallelujah in other word so you say what it is do do demon the doubt fight Christians every day every day we had to fight the same Devils everybody else fight how Demons of doubt try to make us think why this a happening for me what what caused this to happen here so look at look at this thing right here here going to prophet of God he dealing with the thinging in the book of North and not how how that when his wife died his his wife died his baby died and they was they was go R the demon of Doubt attacked him right he was fighting a battle in the spirit realm the mental realm and the devil come to him with the scripture and he used he used it and he said to him you say God is a good god that what you've been preaching to the peoples he healed other peoples and he raised other people but he let your baby die he said he couldn't tell me was a wasn't a God cuz he doesn't experience too much of that but what he was doing telling me that God didn't care for him oh yeah how many times he go through a trial first mental thing the devil God must don't love me I'm going through the trial no that is not a sign that God don't love you that's a sign that God got cover is in you he know when he texed your Revelation that I don't care how hard it yet you will stand the test says here I'm talking about Revelation Faith now I'm talking about supernatural Faith so brother the devil fighting him in his mind this demon of Doubt Supernatural power telling him right you say he's a good God he let your baby die he let your wife die you say he good you pray for you how you stood for God now all of a sudden you he let you down you going you may you might want to throw in the towel you done made yourself people done talk about he just on and on beating him down and brother B say I was about to say right the demon of Doubt had tacked him so in power and mental realm that brother said I was about to say if God got to treat me the way I want sir he said but at the minute I got ready to say something from the inside of the inside rose up and said the Lord give it and the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the Lord that's that's real Faith that's what keeping us from day to day it ain't that we doing it ourselves that's right Lord help me to hold on no help Faith to hold on mey word what we need to prep more of you know let me use this real quick the guys was going down and cast that boy had a Dev D demon demon forming at the mouth the disciples challenge this devil Jesus gave them power Matthew 10 to do it right they got up on the fire line and this devil laugh at him yeah Hallelujah here they go tacking this demon Hallelujah in the name of Jesus devil say I ain't going nowhere y'all boys is a joke why did he do this because they was looking at themselves right they was looking at flush to do it and other words so you if you notice here they were looking at flush to do it now you remember Jesus himself he already told the discip he I have meat that you know nothing of so Jesus was had a secret real that he would be in when they were down there the McDonald burger taste good Jes be up on the mountain getting in contact with God he was on the mountain praying and breaking through here go the these guys over here they was all worked up this way and they thought they can go eat a big McDonald down and go then challenge the devil to devil ain't going nowhere you better get off man here they was here so how you know the St here so finally Jesus came down here Jesus come down here go the man so we brought these guys to your disciples and they could not even catch the devil out I heard about their reputation Jesus said I got my reputation on the line y'all boys don't made me look bad you old foolish generation of unbelief huah Jesus said and the word in and Jesus looked at him Jesus be and this man look at his oh God help my unbelief Hallelujah Lord we need to ask God to move our unbelief out of the way hle what Lord help me to get my unbelief to the side so here and Jesus stood there Jesus said deaf and dumb demon come out of the child amen disciples standing there looking at this hey buddy wait till he catch him I don't know why it didn't happen the Bible say Jesus walking and got him to the private and put him to hey wait a minute man you explain something to us we done we we haul it we we we done everything good we we shouted and everything that why we would leave right Jesus said cuz you got too much of you in the way you got too much of you in the way he said this guy right here don't come out when you eat McDonald and drinking a big coat he said this kind right here come out by fasting praying what get your body subject so God can use your spirit realm Jesus said get yourself out of the way so God will use you but this can't come out by FAS and praying amen we talking about we talking about let us use it from the prophet let you quot from the prophecy he said I'm just going to use a few things like I'm get r p you going to get nervous he says here in the in in in the in the message trial page 23 he begin to explain this gift the gift is not you trying to make it happen the gift is that you know you get out of the way so you know it will happen Hallelujah in other words so he goes here he goes here in in in in the message trial page 23 he said what is it it's a gift a give ain't to take to take a and use like a sword go and go punching and joging and pulling that is not a gift it is just getting yourself out of the way out of the way so that the Holy Spirit can work in a human body in other words get out of the way help God help me to get myself out of the way how brother Brandon never tried to put the human part into the Super Supernatural part he said he goes in here he's standing in the meat and he's getting ready to deal with the demon power and if you notice how the prophet deal with it he said he be talking you be said when he going to preach when he come he when he come he know that he couldn't do it until he come so now brother BR every man kind of different you know uh some some kind of some CH of start over you know and they and they start out getting slow the night you know you can see anointing move right even in a teacher yeah he know where he'll start off you think well he just talking out a while that talking becomes Supernatural you know you pulled into the Revelation whoa I didn't see that what it is it's a gift it don't it don't mean that you know everybody think a gift is when you run in the holl that's all right that's the way God made me but God ain't made everybody the same way that why I don't believe that nobody can take Brother D reing place I see so many preachers trying to be brother dy I said man try to be yourself right then God can use you you don't have to be nobody but what God Made You God made one of you he made one of me some people try to be brother and B I see them all oh I said man be what God made you you don't have to try to be nobody else that why God can use people everybody want to take somebody in play be what God made you and he said then God will bless you I don't have to try to be Nobody But Me Right Amen in other words he said but get yourself out of the way brother stand there and all of a sudden he's standing he's talking and all of a sudden it's like chaining gears you can tell when he chain gears he stepped then he said all right brother I see you now I then in other words he ain't like some of the guys I seen do it I was in a meeting one guy said sister you got cancer she said I do he said well you didn't know it he said jump for your heel and she I said man that's a tree I mean good grief I can go right here you got a headache and this and then there and you n that ain't what I'm talking about I'm talking about the word of God to go back right amen devil know what the devil cannot go back and tell devil don't go word in words the devil don't know your future hallah now here you go the word of God know your fure you know your he know your past where you come from and he know your future where you going to how so he's standing here he's standing there he said all right sister I see you riding a bike a dog was running you you you fa and you had a concussion you got up in this dis he said but I want to let you know he I see you over here you went to a doctor last week you standing and all how what he do now he done see where she come from he see what she ate now she standing there he said I want to let you know right now if you believe God you can walk out of here heal and they accept their healing why because the word deserve where they come from where they were and what they a and they accept God and it's gone well that same thing work the same way if you can accept the word the word I said my word and my word heal you and a man healing you it's your faith in the word can I believe the word can you accept the word you can have anything you ask Hallelujah he said get in other word do not try to to Glory he do not say glory to God I got a a gift you will never get it but if you just know to let yourself go it's just like pulling a girl changing yourself into into faith from unbelief into Faith right you said can I do that he said you good in other words in other words you know in other words I can't make it happen but God can he can change himself into just up from unbelief and jerk and another way and another way you like me you stay there you know you're in a real it's different being in a real with God and being in the human realm in the human realm you know I mean when a man when a man like SE when Samson had the anointing of God on him and got himself out the way God come down but that was in the when he got out of the way God come down and Ed the gift of Fai that he had in him but when s went that way he was just a man see that what people Miss brother Brandon they said well brother Brandon wasn't a man brother BR was a man and brother Brandon made opinions but that we that what we say brother say don't take the pin go back to what I'm saying in the word they asked brother Bron a question one time sister hum the one wrote him the the D brother Bron when Martin Luther King was brother and brother said I believe that you know the way the thing going Martin Luther King would lead the people to a Slaughter and everything and so sister hum got everybody going around the church that was thus said the Lord that was th said the Lord so sister H wrote and she wrote brother Bron said brother BR what that just said the Lord would your your opinion brother said Oh Sister him he said that was my opinion yeah he said I you know he's just looking at thing we all got we all look at things we see things happen and then sh he said ah he said I need to scrap that out he wrote on he said I write this on my hand so not I can say something when he got up that night he said that was my opinion and everything like that so he would let the people say he want the people to see I'm a man but when he stood there and D said the Lord come here you watch your he had chain good when he done that right so the differ deal sometime you know you you you'll get with me and I'm an outgoing person right if you around me you didn't know me prop say this guy is crazy but that just that I'm a human being I I enjoy seeing people happy right that's right you know I hate to be around people you know W you brother jeel I don't know what I'm do I think I'm going to die today I guess you will cuz I'm not going to die with you I had a guy one time I was in an airplane with a guy he was so in the Blues and he was so beat down by the devil he looked at me he said brother Jewel I said what's wrong with you brother he said I'm so depressed I'm fighting so much depression he going through a divorce and thing he said I believe the day that we going to crash in this plane he speaking to the wrong version of that I we planning on crashing in this plane I said you might going to crash I said about I ain't crashing in the plane today you wait till you fly by yourself then you get that Spirit on you that's right I got PR for sister last week sister Chambers uh uh the brother uh I forgot his name the preaching brother ER that's his name yeah that's his name yeah I tell day go God bless I tell my I went up a couple weeks ago to pray with sister Cha about a month ago she passed I just went down the funeral about a month ago I went up there and now we're going to pray for her and everything so I'm going to pray a pray like she's old lady she's eight or seven years old so I figured i' pray a good prayer you know they try to give her peace you know I know she getting red cross over and I started praying I said Lord take Lord give her faith when she cross over Jordan and I'm praying this kind of prayer and then she holler stop I said what you she said you praying for me to die I say what s I ain't ready to die yet in other words she let me know she wasn't going to her time well you know I mean that was that thing she bleed I mean I just try toplay a comfort you know she didn't want to hear a FR like that she said you pray me to die it did it broke my Chann of anointing though it did but I to say but we get ready to close here faith is though see what we take we build faith on the rim when everything is going good and that's the the majority of things that people do when they talk about faith they talk about you know the song talk about faith when you up on the mountain I wish I can keep that song on the mountain yeah I would never let it go to the valley off the Record scratch stay on the mountain don't let me go in the valley but if you don't go in the valley you'll never learn how to trust God you'll never learn how to help C is in God hallelujah there Ain nothing wrong with the song it's something wrong with the peoples everybody want to stay on the mountain oh boy this so pretty up real but down in the valley H down in the valley that's where the power comes that a source of power come Hallelujah in other words so I say you know a lot of time we go through faith and we talk about faith and and we talk about Lord I I've been calling on your name and you're not healing me and this and that we get to start we get to frustrating and talking and get anything you know we thought well he ain't going to hear me well he can't hear you with that kind of attitude right but faith is yes Revelation faith is right is what the Hebrew boys had how the Hebrew boys had the right kind of faith we know that my God is able H I want to let you know right now your God is able and you got to know that he's able every day that we know that he's able but I want let you know something else if he don't deliver us that don't change God if he don't bring us out of the fire that don't change our God I live for God and I die for God if I had to die I'm holding on to my faith that's Revelation your faith if he deliver or if he don't we more than able to do it Hallelujah so that fath was I'm not going to waver in my trial right because I'm having a trial if he heal me or if he don't I know He's Able Hallelujah and I'm going to keep testifying and I'm going to keep giving God glory sometime we think people that not getting healed that oh that person ain't got no faith they've been saying they want been talking about that thing for 20 years and they heal Hallelujah I just give up that what your that's a wrong attitude but that's real real Fai when you going through a trial you can keep testifying how do real faor when you going through your greatest child you still holding God up I know that my God is able don't let no devil I got trial in my life but I'm not giving in to the trial I'm giving glory to God praise God anyway real faith is you know sometime we look at our childres and they're going opposite and they're doing everything that you can think of and the devil fight you that demon of doubt your child ain't going to be there he's a devil he do that you what you looking at you looking at flesh you looking at the Flesh of the child you looking at all his mistakes you looking at everything that he doing wrong in the de and he done got you so depressed I don't even pray for the child no more that what the devil want you to say that what the devil want you to say but I want to let you know right now I'm not giving up H that mean that that mean I'm going to get right here and I'm going to keep knocking and I'm going to keep knocking and I'm going to keep knocking until God hear my pray I don't know how long it going to take I ain't giving up H Jesus said ask anything in my name and he didn't put a little liation on that he did not put a limitation on that I don't know how God going to save them I don't know how they going to get there that ain't for me to know but my problem is God say they'll be there Hallelujah claim them amen hallelujah you got pray over them don't you worry about how God going to do it it might be the last minute of his life and he might look up say Lord come into my heart as long as he make it that's all I'm concern about H that's the kind of Fai we need we give in too much we want we we don't hold on a confession long enough musicians come I'm going to use this last quote as they come brother Brandon use simple things to bring out power to express Faith he uses nature to express Faith he talking about nature and resurrection and then he goes here he goes in this message right here the restoration of the brid tree and he used this little s simple thought right here as I close with this you say I need Faith what do I need to do you need to learn how to let go right you know sometime the Holy Ghost want to get on people they can't let go I feel it boy I Just sh you should just did it nobody Ain going to knock you down for shouting and praising God that's that be the last thing Brother Sam going to do how if it's genuine worship it'll be inine in order Hallelujah one thing about the Holy Ghost don't get out of order I've seen the sister shout the other week shouted the power God hit her she fell dead in the floor and a dress stayed in order that's the Holy Ghost I seen one sister shouting one down and the dress fell down that's the wrong Spirit it might have been on Spirit only but it wasn't the Holy Ghost cuz the prophet God said the Holy Ghost don't get that order right Hallelujah you know in other words so in other words we just seen things happen under the real of God hallelujah in other words I was preaching that brother BR brother Brady got enough slack on the floor to slide a SL through it man I was sweating and I and I said why y'all yes sir got back up my wife said didn't even miss a lck even the people were like did he did he fall my wife said I don't know what he doing he laugh him to do anything but I was in the spirit so nothing body yeah you know what I'm talking about bro man you get on there you can see yourself you know but you don't want to get in the flesh brother homor say he got in the flesh so he was that brother Bray H the pull pit about that high say he run and he jump say mid her he thought uhoh you don't want to make that mistake and been there and done that I done been in the flesh too before one night I got so stirred up in the spirit I thought I going to run and cut a flip yeah I run down the aisles of that church I I hear something I said I said oh God not me and I I went up there and I start bagging back real slow so people didn't know what was going on trying to make myself believe it didn't happen to me but there was a vent behind the pull pit it did happen yes sir there a lot different between the spirit and the flesh Hallelujah spirit it's the truth I mean the truth in a way he said now I'm going to we want to learn how to use this law the law is Letting Go letting God you know I I mean if genuine shouting J praising it's If any man is putting that down the man need the Holy Ghost if a man say I don't believe the power of God is the same as it what if it don't prod do Mark 16 you got to write the answer God you going to have to answer to God at the day of judgment right exactly you don't need no preacher to pray for your baby if he's sick right all you need is the word my little
