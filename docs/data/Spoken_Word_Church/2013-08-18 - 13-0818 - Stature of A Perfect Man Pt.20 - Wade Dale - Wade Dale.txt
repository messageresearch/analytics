========================================

okay didn't have brother Danny with us from the Philippines he's going to be speaking for us today and we've had a delegation of of island of the Filipinos for a week or so so we uh enjoy them being around us because they're they're great people I always thought that we were talking together Friday night I told him that brother Toriano I thought he was always the serious one because he always got a serious look on his face and brother Danny he said brother if you see a Filipino with a serious look on his face what'd you say yes he's just kidding so he's just kidding no no we've had a blast my I've laughed Joel foreign all right well Hebrews 11. now we were we were beginning to discuss a few things last Sunday about by faith so faith is a revelation right so in the Statue of perfect man that's why we're taking so long with this Foundation of faith is because it is the very Foundation of Christianity you you must have faith in something that you've never seen in your life show me the new birth show me your new birth we as human beings we like to see things right okay but Hebrews 11 starts off telling you one thing's for sure faith is the substance of things that hope for the evidence of things you've never seen I mean we we see these things that uh there's a man that's in the Philippines that he uh um acts after crucifixion they actually nail nails in his hands but if they need them said yeah every year they may actually nail nails in his hands put him on a cross for a certain length of time well see that doesn't even prove to me that Jesus Christ was was crucified but I have to believe by faith that he was and then that faith that I have speaks back and says that's exactly correct and then the Bible was written for our admonition for us to learn and study and to see what God's already done for us he's already done it he does it he reveals it and then he makes it manifest so God done it before the foundation of the world he's revealing it to us now I was thinking about this morning um is that eating cereal I don't know why sometimes stuff comes from me eating cereal or riding the lawnmower so I don't know where it comes from but but you you look at people and you see that faith has to really come by hearing and then you have to rent that what's inside of you has the ring back to that right it has to ring back because she takes feel smelling here can be deceivable but watch the Providence of God you know we say we're in the day of the open book which is correct Christ came down through a prophet and opened the book to us well even in the closed book that's what I'm thinking about this morning even during the time of the closed book God took a bride right God took abroad even in the closed book we say the clothes even even Luther's little lion and Wesley's little light God was pleased with those people why because they believed Luther one day said that just shall live by what faith not by work not by Penance not by crawling on your hands and knees brother Danny sees that a lot over in the Philippines they do pennants and stuff like that because there's a lot of Catholics over there and then this this guy that hangs on the cross he may think he's going to heaven just because well he could be the biggest Senator than ever he's not born again he's not a child of God okay so he's just doing that as penance and then you see the people that beat themselves with the the like the Canon Tales you know Daddy was telling about blood blood splatter and everywhere that's not an act they actually do that well they think they're appeasing God well Luther walks out one day and says no the just are the people that are Justified have to live by faith not by that but now by the faith you have we'll show your works don't forget that remember Works without faith faith without works they work together but to have substance Faith which is the bottom of that pyramid that means that God has actually come to you in the New Birth and give you a part of himself actual substance it's like brother brother uh Soriano we'll talk about Wednesday night it's not just a spirit sure God is a spirit but he's in spirit form but he's in you and he's not like Casper the Friendly Ghost he has a form he's a man he's actually a person because he is the personality of almighty God because that right there is the personality of almighty God the statue of perfect man is the personality of God himself okay because when Jesus came on Earth he didn't act any different than the father why because he was the father made manifest in another form so what about you and I we think here's Jesus here's brother Branham and here's us well now Jesus was virgin born that sets him apart but now the same holy ghost that William Branham has the same holy ghost that I have I choose whether to let it work come on we're free moral agents brother Brown said the Holy Ghost is very timid why would a Prophet come and talk about the Holy Ghost as an actual person give me my personality you know all the other denominations that go well we hope that we live a good life and we hope that that we'll meet something later on in Life or right at our death or after our death we'll meet our our theophany well when God comes to you if Jesus if we bypass our theophany like he was talking about Wednesday night if we bypassed it and he came with it which was just what so so when brother Brown said his soul came back on the day of Pentecost in the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's the theophany in 120 people so that's theophany we're going to look for you know the Bible says we've got a body waiting in heaven well what is heaven well Graham said heaven was a word there is a literal place called heaven but you know what heaven will pass away Heaven and Earth will pass away we're going to live down here but if you have any questions you can just stop and this is just kind of open discussion you don't have a whole bunch no no everybody can have the same to the office sure that's why it would make you a son and daughter of God I act like a devil because I'm a Dale but parents and I have different traits because of our Humanity but inside if he disagrees with the word and I agree with the word then he and I are not of the same family it all comes back to the word right here this word is where your body is being built right right you glorified bodies being built around your born-again experience well where's your Born Again experience out there somewhere no it's right here I don't have a body come on I don't have a body hanging up somewhere in the closet that I'm going to I'm gonna step this theophany not with this this over into another dimension correct okay everybody understand what I'm saying this Glory my glorified body's coming later Jesus is the only one who's on the glorified body everybody understand that say amen amen Jesus is the only one right now with a glorified body he is the only one that has reached immortality which means one time he was Immortal and now he's immortal I don't care he will explain anything I can't explain it not going to it because the Bible says there's only one person reaps immortality that means he was Immortal he died he resurrected and became Immortal nobody else has been that way or the Bible is wrong okay so they are waiting in that sixth dimension in their theophany which is the Holy Ghost brother Brown said all these people browned he said no he said well what is this the angel told him said this is perfect love well there's only one common denominator remember they were black-headed redheaded women right but they all had one thing in common they had a new birth when they were alive here on the earth they had the new birth Dimension is that theophany of God that Genesis 1 26-27 and it's waiting on you and I to whip the Redemption of this body not another one right or that would be replacement this is redemption brother Brown said if I die go to the Grave he said my spirit goes to God who gave it Soul goes into the sixth Dimension at the Resurrection The Soul picks up the spirit comes back into that same body and resurrects now you're not going to go out here to the graveyard and you're not going to see Graves dug up it's a secret catching away but somehow you say somehow well Jesus walked through a wall in his glorified body and then a fish right it didn't fall through him he had substance that's the glorified condition we've not made that yet but we're sitting in Heavenly places what is Heavenly place in heaven it to me when the to me when the Bible talks about heaven I think about the word because I'm not in heaven I may be Heavenly places we're in Heavenly places at the Statue of a perfect man that's Heavenly places but then we grow in Grace and knowledge we got everything we need for our journey I talked so long I forgot you forgotten what she's going to ask you're my you're remembering the man raise your hand back up but does everybody understand that we're talking about a real thing here here everybody had a hope of eternal life when brother Brown came and that book opened I believe he saw eternal life right here because this is where we're gonna live we're not going somewhere else God saw the city coming down brother Brown said on a redeemed entire Earth this Earth like he doesn't annihilate you at the new birth he burns you over kills the old nature we don't believe in Two Souls where you got one here and one will be under and you get this one you get that note once off brother Brown said I don't believe in transmigration of Soul right which means my soul could go over in his body or my Soca Gore in another body see that does away with all that if you take the whole message the whole message if I died today and I fell on the ground you're not gonna have to open the door for my soul to get out it it goes over into another dimension because brother Brown said it's faster it's faster so if it's faster it steps over into another dimension this can't go because it's not glorified yet okay right but the Inside Man is if you're born again there's the theophany there's not one there's not a coat hanging up in a closet somewhere right that's what I'm saying about this statue of a person man this is real and required now it's not required in the millennium it's required now that somebody come to a place of adoption where God thinks just as much of you in your flesh as he did Jesus because Jesus in his flesh on Mount Transfiguration sure he was transfigured sure his body's shown and all these great things but when he come down down off of that mountain he was just as human as he was when he went up on the mountain right he suffered he died he had to eat he was hungry he got a little ill he was still a man but he was almighty God in that man all right so everybody understand where we're going with this because you go but you got to believe this this is why I'm hanging so much this is uh part 20. trying to build a foundation we've had 20 many services just trying to get people to believe in faith to believe that you're born again to believe that God will do what he said he will do because if brother Brown said the Holy Ghost was a gentleman then guess what you grieve him he's going to go out on a whim now he's not going to come out you understand this is all for our illustration purposes right brother Danny was an English teacher you make illustrations to get people to see things better and the illustration brother Brandon made wasn't that the Holy Ghost was going to come out of you and go set out on a back porch somewhere no you know what you've done you just hindered it from working remember we were talking about the pill you take that capsule of pill inside there and if you take that that pill and pull it apart and what's inside there is what helps you the outside is not going to do you any good the outside just made out of Glycerin or or whatever it is glycolor but it's going to dissolve put in the right environment put it in the right environment you got to swallow the pill you can't lay the pillow down on the ground and say well that's that's gonna do me good that's really going to do me good and two weeks later you're still sitting you're gonna say well why didn't you take the pill while the doctor said that it would help me well you gotta take it put it in the right environment let the thing dissolve and then what's inside can help you same way with the new birth we were born in sin shaping an iniquity espousing our mothers when I'm a liar a capsule of corruption a capsule of sin a capsule of unbelief a capsule that is anti-word so that makes you born Antichrist I don't care who you are except for Jesus Christ remember he was born right that's what he was trying to tell Nicodemus Nicodemus was going back to the natural sex act do I have to go back in my mother's womb right Jesus said no no you got to be born from a love you got to be born from my daddy that's where the seed of life comes from is my dad the Father which is in heaven right which we know with any but same way with you and I that's what we don't understand we we try to pray to a god out there and uh I think a lot of times preachers think God's hard of hearing because they scream a lot Jesus never screamed one time in his life I don't believe he has support Lazarus he screamed but only one time but you know why he said that for him so that everybody wouldn't come up remember brother Ram said he had to shout Lazarus or everybody would have resurrected right all right but remember that that supreme power in control is not somebody shaking you or forcing you to do something or or trying to scream it out of you remember the demon said something to Jesus one time and he said go I don't believe he screamed at him he just didn't go why he was in control will it when you become a Son of God if you'll watch brother Brandon brother Brown never screamed it to people you're in those prayer lines it was it was real soft and calm and he'd even talk to the devil and he'd talk to him in a regular tone of voice he said come out of this woman Satan now if you're in the name of Jesus Christ you know what the power behind that voice it didn't have to be 100 decibels High but the power behind it like brother Brown said about the little boy little man with the with the badge in the gun waiting 90 pounds stopping the you know 600 000 pounds or sixty thousand pound train what he wasn't a man that could do it it was the power behind the man that could do it and that's why I think that we're so I don't want to say this wrong but we're so um Slack when it comes to the power of God but it's because you and I do it it's not because God's not powerful that's great it's because you and I are not believing enough the pills laying out here somewhere it's not in here we'll do you some good but that right there that statue of a perfect man is the key to the whole thing of getting us out of here nobody in the history of time has ever put that statue of perfect man together like the prophet did Peter said add to your faith virtue and your virtue and all is not you know he was telling the people but look what brother Branham did he actually brought it into a life paralleled it with the church ages and then showed that that Faith you receive the new birth and then there's a holy spirit baptism up there above brotherly kindness that has to come into the believer not that you receive the new birth at the top of the pyramid no no no Faith down there at the bottom is your new birth right thank you I don't see it any other way remember I'm pretty sure another day on glorified again well that's what he did he glorified you at the river and then he's going to glorify you again in a mountain that's what he did with Jesus he glorified him on he said this is my son who's my wife please to dwell he didn't say here he and him at the river he didn't say that to you he didn't give you the car keys to the car no you got on a tricycle you had baby Faith but then as you grow up when you get up on that mountain when Jesus stood on that mountain he said here you him in other words this is a man you're going to hear it from or the woman that you're going to hear from me because you sisters that's the statue of a perfect m-a-n not man gender-wise that's mankind so we had a Prophet come and show us how to do these things gave us a step by step and I believe the whole process that brother Branham went through was to forget to turn this thing on was to so they'll be listening to us listening to a solid page and watching them swim so anyway funny how things come to you right in the middle of something that I didn't turn this thing on so I've been adjusting it for nothing but Faith version all is temperance what that does that builds on your Holy Ghost experience okay that's the building that reservable was supposed to do what sweep off the foundation and start building the building and that's what brother Branham did he brought us to a place to where we could go up the building and he described the Holy Ghost as a person a person that was very timid why is he very timid because if you don't let him in one of the doors of your heart he's not going to burst his way in that's right he's going to say okay whatever you want to do it's your choice because you know what one day when you say well God I didn't have a lot of patience when I was when I was coming up through there he said well I tried to give you some and you didn't want it go ahead somebody raise them in oh I think that's why God chose the Gentiles rather than the Jews wanted him he's not going to force himself that's right and they believe by faith like the Centurion he believed by faith Jews have to see something yes laying on a man is a Jewish tradition but the Bible does say lay hands on the sick and then shall recover Nate don't say lands on the sick and and shake them and scream at them until no it says just lay hands on sick and they shall recover that stumps a lot of people because we've come through Pentecost and all these different denominations it says you guys screaming shake them and you know Ravel them that's not it we got to get people to start believing that that that's not it you know brother Brown said every time you go to the altar you get weaker what is that every time you go to that offer you get weaker because that's not a gentile tradition that's a Jewish tradition sure it's like a member of the clock we're talking the other day there are some churches that believe in that totally that you should never come up to the front never have an awkward call no now we don't believe that here that's right but now there are some that will believe and not have to have that the Centurion but there are some people that will have to have hands laid on them every Sunday to get something off of them or get so what big deal I mean it's in the Bible you can't take it out that's right it says laying hands on the sickness y'all recovered so we still do it but it should be coming up the statue of a perfect man to where you don't go up there as much as you used to go up there okay now that's your growth development as a Christian when I was first born again I was in the altar of life I had a lot to get off of me I have a lot I had a lot I had a lot of changing to do and I needed some help to do it but now when God gives you the new birth and he sells you into a place you just accept it by faith and then you see the things work out in your life you don't have to go to the altar but as Christians though we need each other it's not you don't go out there on them on an island somewhere and say well I don't need anybody no we need each other's strength that's what we're going to talk about Lord willing when I get back maybe we'll we won't be able to read this but see that's virtue it's all I don't have virtue like Peter did why not why do you like to come here and Converse or have conversation about the word of God and even about things of life because we can help each other in the things of life why because somebody has virtue You Must Believe brother Danny's got virtue today so that's where you're going to get your strength you're not going to get it from nobody else but him today God's going to use him as a conduit and right down through that conduit right to you it's where the word's coming for you today right that's right same thing with with brother Dale we believe he has virtue or we wouldn't come here because he's got something we can draw from he's got a bank that's got plenty of money in it that we can draw from or plenty of word in it that we can drop it right or we'd go somewhere out if you got a default bang you walk up to him all the time you say hey I got this thousand dollar check well we can't cash it because we don't have no money in the bank why would you keep going there and that's the same way where the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is timid the Holy Ghost program said you agree because the Bible says breathing off the holy spirit of God for by yourself for your seal until the day of your Redemption you're born again you're seal got it yes well sometimes I think you know brother clock and I were talking the other night the prodigal son was a son he wasn't the first cousin he wasn't a worker out in the field he was a son in the family and he went done something wrong now you say well well if he no it proved he was a son because he came back look at Adam was the son of God and sold out the whole human race sin in his flesh he let his flesh take over and he's sending his flesh like brother Brown said about the the preacher that said I'm not going to preach anymore and told black guys go buying some beer and and brother Brown said six months later he was dead because God took his child home so he went to Mars name so there's things that we can get in this thing and this part here that we can have the Holy Ghost and our soul and do things wrong but as we grow in Grace and knowledge it should be shedding some of those things off that's one of your walk if you look and say well I don't know more than I did six months ago you've got a problem you've got a problem brother they don't have a problem I don't have a problem you've got a problem and if I don't know no more I have a problem right so don't blame it on everybody else it's our own problem even with the new birth we're going to have plenty of problems but as we go up that statue of a perfect man virtue is strength I need strength you need strength because remember this still this adamic nature it's very strong because it lives in this condition of this world it came in sin so it's contrary this is contrary to God right but what's inside of it is God that's the Paradox you you see what I'm saying but you control whether you get virtue you control whether you get knowledge Temperance place it's all well per second man that's something that you do God's already got it there but it's something you do to either let it out let's see who that it's one of the two either open the door and let him in or keep the door closed right but it's your choice let's go upstairs and let brother Danny get ready but brother Joe will be speaking next Sunday and then the Sunday after that we'll be back and hopefully we'll start a little bit through faith and then into virtue thank you amen amen or old me one of the things okay okay on that you're doing that brother away thank you glad you're here too enjoy thank you everybody foreign
