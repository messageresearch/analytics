seeing you in a while yes it's good to have you here with us again with your son praise the lord jesus amen you love the lord amen amen i'm not going to take too much time uh with preliminaries i want to go ahead directly to the word because i have a lot of content here and now when we go over this content it might seem like it may seem like seem like it's a lot and of course it it takes a while to get all this together and it probably doesn't even do it any any uh what's the word service or favor you know justice uh because it's it's a very expansive topic and it's just hard to cover this in just one wednesday night you know but we'll just do see how the lord leads us but uh i know brother wade he's been bringing out lately he's been bringing out about the dimensions and uh we he's been talking about hell of several several years maybe about a year and a half or two ago i was uh i was talking to a co-worker about about hell and how if in the nominal world is so uh it's so foreign to them to think that hell is not eternal and so but to us you know especially those who grew up in the message we have always heard that and but yet sometimes we can't even explain it we he we hear hell is is it is not eternal but we don't know where to find it in the scripture don't know where to find it in the in the message so uh i got i got to search and and i got to looking in the word and uh just the different i mean it just all ties in together so beautifully and so hopefully by the by the help of the lord tonight maybe the lord will help you see something tonight that you haven't seen before and how it how it ties in with eternal life i mean this is this all involves eternal life again the topic is why hell is not eternal it's a it's a topic that in in the nominal world you know they believe that it is and they strongly believe that especially trinitarian people when i was in the nominal world i thought that there was a eternal hell but let's see what the prophet says and the word says about this okay so let's just bow our heads and you pray for me amen our heavenly father we come before you lord jesus once again thanking you for your word thank you father for the opportunity to roll back the pages of your word lord god we know that you are the author of your word lord and you wrote the word father and you know father god that we need revelation in order to understand fully father god the treasures that are found therein lord so i pray lord jesus that you just reveal it to us father god and help us father god to receive something that would help us lord jesus in our christian walk be with brother ray father tonight lord god continue to strengthen him and touch his body lord jesus oh come down father god and just minister to him where he's at father and and just comfort sister kathy and the family as well during this time lord and in the days ahead father god all the other ones lord that that satan father god is just on a rampage father uh sister sister cleta and all the different ones lord we still continue to pray for them and just be with them lord and and just continue to strengthen their bodies father we just commit ourselves this time into your hands now we ask you these things in jesus christ's name amen amen praise the lord and the brothers they have that little power point so we're just going to do a teaching tonight and so you just bear with us amen praise the lord matthew chapter 25 jesus says and then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world i want you to take notice that when jesus is speaking here he's talking about at the time of the white throne judgment he's not he this is the time when when when you're either going to get in by works or or good works or not that's right that's if you don't get eternal life here on this side this is the only chance that you have and you're either going to get in by good works or if there's no good works you're just not going to get in so this is what jesus is talking about here verse 35 for i was in hunger then you gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee and hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took the end or naked and clothed thee or when shall we be sick or in prison and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you in as much as you have done it unto the unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me amen then shall he say unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was in hunger then you gave me not meat i was thirsty and you gave me no drink i was a stranger and you took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not then shall they also answer him saying lord when saul we thee and hungered or a thirst or a stranger naked or sick or imprisoned did not minister unto thee notice how both parties called him lord because in that day every knee shall bow and every tongue will confess that jesus christ is lord amen then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you and as much as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous look at the differentiation here but the righteous into life eternal amen amen praise the lord jesus so you may be seated amen praise god amen so so in looking at this topic um uh the next slide brothers uh you can see that uh i i took a screenshot here of of of a search i did on google and this this is just some of the books that that are out there on this topic apparently it is very it's a very popular topic people are interested in in hell people are interested in if is it real is it not real amen for you and me if if it's in the word it's real but for the secular world out there and for the nominal world out there who kind of does the psychological thing you know uh they have to you know write the books and kind of try to explain things and who knows some of it might be for money as well but it's a it's a topic that people are interested in amen uh it's among christians and non-christians now next slide hell is also known in the bible as as hades go ahead and click brother hades which is the greek word for for hell it is is is the word hades and uh and then also it's known in the bible that shell or shell next next just click again shall and it that is the hebrew word for for for for hell as well so it's mentioned in the bible in these three in these three forms amen now the next slide we're going to go go through through here quickly because it's got some things here go to you know another this is the meaning of of hell another world in which the dead continue to exist the nether realm of the devil and the demons which condemn people's up for everlasting punishment this is what the world believes you see uh a place or state of misery torment or wickedness amen a place or state of turmoil or destruction now personally and just get just get down to the point personally i believe hell is a place now brother wade he's been talking about this but it is a it is a dimension it's the realm of the lost amen and to and to me the way i see according to the to when you read the message it's almost as if a person is like it's a continuing falling and you can't ever get away from that in other words uh it's almost like for example maybe whatever the the thing that you dreaded the most in life is probably what's coming on you 24 7. non-stop let's just say sometimes kids are scared of these little cartoons and these little things that you know nowadays uh you know zoe sometimes and bella show me some some what is it a horn head or i i don't remember anyways but imagine some some lanky thing that's got two two big old sirens siren head and things like that just imagine that uh uh 24 7. nonstop just coming at you that's how that's i would think that i would say that's hell yeah man it's not necessarily see you know the devil you know with a pitchfork you know hitting you and you know in the back you know anything like that it's not anything like that that's just what's that's what the hollywood has presented and it's what they made us think as we grew up you see but hell is a place of torment and it's a constant i don't know who would want to be in a position like that i mean you put yourself in a place for example if you're having a nightmare and that just might be that just might be a few minutes imagine that nightmare consistently non-stop that's that's that's hell amen next slide now hades this is what hades means is the greek god of the underworld the underground abode of the dead in greek mythology and this is a this is a supposedly hades hades is always pictured with three as a three-headed beast of some sort now what do you think that they got the uh uh the the pitchfork idea that's where they got it from and sometimes they paint hades which is a greek god with three forks on the on the pitchfork or or it's just two so next slide and then shale which is the uh the the hebrew way of of looking at hell is the abode of the dead in the early hebrew thought so that's that's the definition of that next slide all right i put this in because i thought this was interesting did you know that in greek mythology hades is both the land of the dead and the god who rules there hades the god who the greeks also called pluto is the brother of zeus and poseidon this is zeus who ruled the skies and the seas zeus in greek in greek mythology he's like the he's like the the the he's god i mean that's god now where do you think that we increa in the earth when the early christians in catholicism they adopted christianity they got it when these things right they got it from greek mythology and roman roman uh uh beliefs and things like that so but it's interesting that in the greek mythology hades and zeus were brothers now satan in the bible it was the closest thing to to to god remember what i believe is in ezekiel that it talks about uh uh he says he he was beautiful made perfect in every way i mean every he was decorated beautifully so satan is not an ugly uh being he's not somebody with a pitchfork he is he's a beaut he's an angel of light he can transform himself as an angel of light that's why he's so deceiving amen he's the closest thing and so when he was talking to eve when he was talking to eve and telling her hey surely you will not surely die i mean because you know if you eat thereof you know you become as gods knowing right and evil not an eve not realizing that they were already gods amen and he was telling her that they'll become as gods you see so uh he's very deceptive but it's very interesting that in greek mythology that's what that was the belief as well so next slide see everything has a i always tell i always tell uh uh people everything has a root you know you watch a movie it's like brother trevor was talking the other day you know you watch a movie or you you listen to a song or you do something like that it has a root somebody got some something that idea has come from somewhere and it wasn't just something that just come it has a root from from somewhere so these ideas come from group a poll i'm just going through these real quick so that you can understand the the the the what people think of hell in in the time they were living in in 2014 they did a poll to christian or a lot of people in america about if they believed in hell 58 believed in hell in two 59 believed in hell in 2007 in 2014 58 believed in hell it went down and then down here in the air in the graves the ones who don't believe 30 percent in 2007 it went up to 34 in in 2014. and i'm sure it's higher now amen next slide uh this is the the belief of hell amongst religious groups um if you want this information you can come to me i'll be more than glad to give it to you i used to be a jehovah's witness so i know this is true seven percent of them only believe in hell because they they don't really they don't believe in hell they believe that when you die that's it you are completely annihilated you're completely destroyed and uh because they believe that the ones remaining are there 144 000 there will be here left on earth so um evangelical protestants 82 believe in hell 11 don't believe and they're supposed to be evangelical protestants the one supposed to believe the in the bible but yet there's people amongst the same christians that don't even believe in hell that read the same bible that you and i do that talks about it but yet don't believe in it uh uh historically black protestants there's 12 percent of them that don't even believe believe in hell so this is very interesting next slide now this is the generational cohort by belief in hell this is for example younger millennials who don't believe in hell is 16 the ones that believe is 13 um older millennials uh 16 don't believe the ones that do believe 14 but now watch generation x generation x on our next slide i'm going to show a chart of what these generations are generation x is the generation that's rein raised right now at this very moment for example my daughter bella uh zoe my daughters they're considered generation x 27 do not believe in hell this was in 2014 and i'm sure it's higher now so the belief in it it can con is constantly going lower and lower um even baby boomers are starting to to to doubt now saying it's just satan he's on a rampage right now amen next slide and so real quick the the ones that were born between 1928 to 1945 are are called the silent generations that would be you brother dale sister clito sister sister peggy hey man uh the ones born between 1946 1964 would be the baby boomers that would be you brother wade amen 1980 uh that's me we're considered generation x that's between 1965 to 1980. i was born in 1980 that's generation x this should be ages 39 to 54 millennials are born between 1981 to 1996. and then of course from 1997 to 2012 is generation z generation z so so that would be our younger children that's generation z which in the previous slide if you want to go back to that to that slide uh it's generation well it's generation x right here that would be that that's actually that's actually my generation so next slide next slide so if generation x is is not even uh uh believing in hell i can imagine you know generation z that's growing up right now that's what we got to pray for our children give keep them in the word saints do everything you can for them amen don't just let them just let them just just free roam and let the internet take care of them you you're supposed to take care of them amen you're supposed to put luck you know controls in what they watch and what they see and because it's it's going to it's going to uh indoctrinate them right you see and eventually they'll come out and they'll say hey i don't believe this anymore i don't you know don't be surprised if you didn't do your part right don't that's i'm just being wrong with you you know i i ca and you might have done your part but again it boils down to a thing that it has to be between them and god amen it's a it's a it's a relationship between them and god now let's go to the uh nitty gritty let's define the word uh eternal amen so the next slide and in the strong's concordance is the word ionos and that is uh means perpetual eternal forever lasting uh for everlasting uh next slide and this is from thayer's dictionary it means without beginning and end that which always been and always will be amen praise god we we all know that amen if you have god's life in you which is his eternal life if you have god's spirit dwelling in you amen by the new birth amen you have god's own life in you that means your soul amen didn't ever have again it never has an end amen because his spirit's dwelling in you amen uh without beginning amen without end never to cease now it says everlasting and in these definitions they used everlasting back and forth back and forth and that's how the bible uses it back and forth so you have to read it and know what it's talking about we're going to read some quotes here but the brother branham says something really good in the church age book about this uh next slide now let's read matthew 25 41 uh we just read it then shall he say unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels i want you to understand that's how the hell and in this case this is the lake of fire because this is after this is during the the white throne judgment all that was not prepared for you and i nope it was not prepared for humans it was not prepared for animals it was not it was prepared for satan and his angels and because it was prepared that means it has a beginning and if it has a beginning that means it's got to have an end right the only thing that doesn't have a beginning is god's eternal life or god himself amen and it doesn't have an end either because whatever doesn't have a beginning doesn't have an end whatever started has to end amen that's why i always say problems we go i'll go through problems but problems are not eternal thank god for that they have they have a beginning that means they got to have an end now it could be maybe 10 years down the road i don't could be a three seconds it could be 10 minutes i don't know but if it's a problem here on this life it's gonna have an end amen praise god so brother ray right now there's a problem going on he's he's he's got eternal life amen there's no there's no issue amen if the lord decides if it's time to his time to go amen he's better off than we are amen but it has an ending it has an ending every problem has an ending so let's not worry let's say lord oh you know yes it's tough it's hard we all go through problems right but y'all always keep in mind it's always helped me this has an end this has an end this this hasn't been amen so this so the the lake of fire was not prepared for you and me is prepared for satan and his angels matthew 25 46 and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal amen now notice how jesus is making this a distinction between the ones that go into everlasting punishment and the ones who have received life eternal amen see if they were to if the ones that were to go to life to everlasting punishment why didn't jesus use the same wording if they were to be there for eternity just like the righteous they're supposed to be you see he didn't use life eternal he could have said and they shall go into life eternal in life eternal punishment but he didn't say that he said the everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal he makes a distinction between two things so it's not the same thing now we're going to look at the word everlasting here in just a moment uh next so in verse 41 hell or in this case also the lake of fire was not prepared for man but for the devil and his angels next i think it's a nut some more that comes up yes in verse you like you like this animation in verse 46 jesus makes a clear distinction between the outcome of the unrighteous and the righteous you see there's there's a distinction there next just hit it again all right and the same greek word was used in that in that verse there has to be a clear distinction between both parties regarding their life listen to this otherwise both parties would end up with eternal life and the same reward this doesn't make sense doesn't make sense you you believe in eternal hell because you were told there was an eternal head but when you start looking digging down in the word amen you realize wait a second they can't be this way next next slide now this is the word everlasting amen the definition of the word everlasting lasting watch lasting or enduring through all time it could be because the word uses the bible uses interchangeably but you have to know what it's talking about because in the order of events of things you see continuing now watch continuing for a long time or indefinitely you see so it it it could be it could be for a long time the lake of fire is there for a long time but eventually the bible says that it's going to be destroyed it's going to be swallowed up you see amen um tediously persistent so and the oxford dictionary when you read that it says lasting forever or a very long time so it gives a space of time it doesn't say doesn't say just eternal amen there's a space of time amen again you have to go back to verse 46 that we just read in matthew 25 jesus clearly made a distinction between the ones that were the lost and the ones that received eternal life you see and they go to two different places if they have the same eternal life why not go to the same you place so next slide let's see what the prophet says and the message why am i why i'm against organized religion and there you excuse me for all the yellow and all that but you know hopefully it's getting your attention and there's no scripture that says there is an eternal hell because eternal never did begin neither does it ever end so the bible said hell was created for the devil and his angels so it it's it isn't eternal there was a time when it wasn't and there will be a time when it's not again but they may be punished in their through fire and brimstone and the pits of fire for eons of time all right but it finally will end because hell is not eternal hell is not hell it itself or it can't be eternal you see eternity belongs to a person amen eternity is a person man that's right therefore uh it can't be inside of a place you know and make that thing eternal you see it has to eternity has to dwell in you amen has to dwell in a person next brother branham continues here and if there was an eternal hell you'd have to have eternal life to live in an eternal hell and if it was eternal it always was and you always was in hell and you'll always be in hell now what brother branham is talking about there is those of you who have eternal life for example if you have eternal life and if hell was eternal then you'd always be part of that of hell right right but remember hell was created for satan and his angels it has a beginning god doesn't have a beginning amen are we are we understanding amen just kind of breaking down what the prophet's saying amen see there is no such a thing it doesn't make any sense but when you tell people this i mean it's just like they just don't get it and you you really come to a point where you really like lord if it's not a revelation people won't understand it exactly i mean you can just give them all the data and you can give them bullet points and you can just like explain to them but if it doesn't become alive in people's in people's life it'll just it'll just be like i don't get it i don't get it and they feel like they're being deceived and that you're in a cult i've had the same co-worker co-worker think that i'm i'm in a cult he's like man everything you're telling me just sounds like a cult what can you say there so you see eternal is never had a beginning or an end and there's only one form of eternal life and that is in god all right comes from the greek word zoe which means god's own life and when we are born again of the spirit of god we become eternal with god amen because we have part of his life which makes us sons and daughters to god then we have eternal life again brother branham states then we have eternal life we don't come here with eternal life amen we have to come to eternal life here in this life amen you have to make a choice that's why god gave us a free moral agency amen you see the ones that go to hell or the ones that died the loss they made their choice here their choice was not to serve god the gospel probably was presented to them and they rejected it at some point in time maybe even hitler came to that point i know hitler was involved a lot of things with the catholic church and things like that maybe at some point in time it was presented to him and maybe he didn't flat out reject it but in the in his actions he rejected it and that's what caused his fall maybe some of us we don't flat out say no i don't i don't i don't want the word i don't want to serve god i don't want to you may not say it but your actions display it and it'll show your choice as to where you're heading after this life right because we're all going to be heading somewhere you're somewhere and eventually once you get to that point you're going to have to depend on the white throne judgment then to get you in if you were good to mom and dad or if you were good to an uncle or some neighbor or something like that there was a that was part of the bride i don't want to get in on that i want to know for for sure now that i have the goods i don't want to wait until i get to the train station amen and and not have the ticket ready to go amen get the ticket now amen get ready now while the time is still while we're still in this time amen next amen brother brown continues saying here's questions and answers see the difference the wicked has everlasting punishment in other words it has it has an end to that but everlasting is a space of time now if it would have been the same it would have been written and these shall go away into everlasting punishment the other shall go away into everlasting life see or they shall go away into eternal punishment and the other one into eternal life talking about like the verse that we were just reading in matthew chapter 25 verse 46 see if there's an eternal punishment to be punished forever and ever then there's an eternal he's got eternal life the sinner has eternal life just like you next and the only one eternal life and that comes from god look everything without a beginning has no end everything with the beginning has an end see what i mean amen so just explaining to what we were talking about amen so you should be the happiest people on earth amen with with eternal life in your soul and that eternal life has got to be true it's got to translate into into eternal life for your body a redemption for your body going to manifest on the outside we're heading towards that at this very moment amen i believe that with all my heart and it'll come to its culmination amen john john chapter 10 verse 28 says and i this is jesus speaking and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish so who is the source of eternal life jesus christ who is god amen neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand amen once you're sealed in the kingdom of god there's nobody satan can't even take you out satan will try his best but he can never pluck you out of his out of his hand amen praise the lord next slide now john uh chapter 12 verse 25 again we're going through a lot of reading but just be patient with me amen and i'm just kind of trying to keep things in in order you know he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world in other words in this life that you're living in shall keep it unto life eternal amen i preached the message amen uh i think i titled it amen i want to be a loser do you yeah but this is somewhere this is what i want to lose i want to lose my life so that i can gain his amen lose everything that i am amen that's carnal everything that that that comes against the word of god that i may gain him amen it's what paul said romans chapter 6 verse 23 says for the wages of sin is death in other words let's just read it like this for the wages of unbelief is death because that's what sin is is unbelief in other words that's your reward it's death for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life amen the gift of god when you believe his word amen take it in and lord that's for me i accept it amen eternal life praise god watch through jesus christ our lord in the baptist church we quote this all the time but you know now brother dale has become more real to me when you understand the man about eternal life and in your soul and and and everything it just it's a good verse to kind of get people saved yeah right you see and they tell you this you know and you and it is it's it it's a good but then when you really read it and look at it and say lord thank god but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord and lord who who who have we believed in amen amen it's in our lord jesus christ amen next all right so these last verses that we were just reading tie with this verse now we're going down to revelations chapter 20 and the sea gave up verse 13 and the sea we're talking about the first death and second death now and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works this is what's going to happen just right before the the the white throne judgment amen verse 14 and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death amen after the judgment amen death and hell were cast into the lake of fire now so the lake of fire has to be something separate from hell it can't be hell but you see in the nominal world it's used interchangeably and people get confused they think that the lake of fire is hell and that hell is the lake of fire it's two is two different things hell is thrown into the lake of fire so is death hell and death is thrown into the lake of fire and not only that the unbeliever who didn't make it through the white throne judgment is also thrown in there not only that satan is also throwing their false prophet and all these different ones they're going to be thrown in there to what to be completely annihilated and whosoever was not found watching whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire now i would rather you know it's if i was a sinner you know an unbeliever i'd rather i'd rather have eternal life burning in hell but to be completely annihilated to exist no more that's actually worse that's worse than to be burning you know forever but you have eternal life doesn't make any sense there has to be a complete annihilation sure the fact that that hitler died and god be the judge but but but let's say hitler might be in a constant hell right now judas for example the bible says that he was the son of perdition in other words the son that was to be lost he's right now in a constant hell right now it could be right now that that that what he did the betrayal is constantly just being displayed in front of him and it's just a constant that's that's a hell right that's a torment but that torment has to cease because they will be thrown into the lake of fire if they don't get if they don't make it through the white throne judgment so is that that i hope that that's amen next slide all right so next i think we have some things all right so the first death it is go ahead it is the death that you die after your life leaves this earth now the bible doesn't mention first death but every time he talks about this death it just mentions death so it is the first death whenever we pass away from this life it is it is death it's the first death next go ahead brother the second death it is death that takes place in the lake of fire which is it's is not hell so we just established because hell is thrown into the lake of fire amen next slide are you still with me amen appreciate you all are listening so nicely i don't see anybody sleeping yet that's awesome it's great [Laughter] let me do more animations amen so the second death this second death is complete annihilation because death and hell go into this lake of fire as well complete annihilation now we're going to look at something here because all souls belong to god amen this is where death first death hell and all unrighteous will be completely destroyed never to ever exist again that's a scarier thought than any than even eternal hell amen to never see to cease to exist to never not even be in the mind of god you know in the mind of god not even to be in the in the mind of anybody ever again satan's coming to that point amen praise god next but he just wants to take everybody he can with him he knows these scriptures are there talking about him whether he believes him or not i mean i believe he does but he's he knows he's sealed to death hebrews 12 28 29 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear receiving a kingdom that is the uh holy spirit amen that's god's eternal life for our god is a consuming fire so as they say the buck stops with god everything amen he is the creator he did create amen and correct me if i'm wrong brother dale but he did create the lake of fire he did create these these places amen they but they're not eternal amen they're they're the stopping place for for the unrighteous and the stopping place for hell death and satan amen next because god is a just god he's got to punish evil amen he's got he's got to completely do away with unbelief amen ezekiel 18 4 be watch what god says here behold all souls are mine that includes the the even the sinner out there not just the christian even the sinner out there those souls belong to god amen and there's something i put here in just a moment uh that you'll see those souls they belong to god but don't necessarily mean that they're part of god you see what i'm saying the souls all souls belong to god let me say it again but don't necessarily are part of god amen once you receive eternal life in your soul you're part of that god you're part of the eternal life amen as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth watch it shall die not that it it may die or it may be no it shall die so enough let's read it like this the soul that unbelieves the word it shall die amen and what is die to completely annihilate that's what that word die in the in in that verse means to completely in other words to completely be eradicated to be to not exist anymore matthew 10 28 and fear not them which killed the body this is jesus speaking and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul in other words jesus saying don't fear man amen but fear god fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell amen and when you look that word destroy right here because you could you could think you know that that's where everything ends remember hell is thrown into the lake of fire but when you look at this word destroy right here it means to render useless mar separation so in hell you're completely separated amen in a constant torment in a constant torment amen amen so don't fear man don't fear what's going on right now fear god amen a lot of people fearing why everything is going on here on the outside and maybe the things that we experience on the outside and then we neglect our our spiritual our spiritual life we neglect praying we neglect reading amen i i i do it amen we neglect the things that will take us amen to a closer walk with him amen next all right so so if now watch this so if god is a consuming fire and all souls are his that means that he can do whatever he wants with man's souls right you get that they're all his he can do whatever he wants to do there are souls that will utterly and completely be destroyed by this lake of fire who he is the source of amen which god is the source of this is because of the choice that those souls made here on earth we have all have free moral agency we all choose if we want to serve god or we want to or we want to reject god amen amen all souls belong to god but all souls are not part of god what makes you part of god is the but his belief in his word amen you're receiving jesus christ amen receiving that word amen in your life and your soul next so if those souls hell and death are all eternal then that means god lives in hell and in death and in those souls that are to be destroyed we know he doesn't if either eternal that means god is part of death god is part of hell god is part of all these things but it doesn't make any sense all right we know this is not the case because light who god is the source of and darkness cannot dwell together amen and we know that light is god's own life amen god's own life next amen i believe uh this is second corinthians chapter six light and darkness cannot coexist be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers let me just stop here for just a moment and let me say something this is why the bible talks about not being unequally yoked together with unbelievers because their destination the destination of the unbeliever is death complete annihilation so why would a christian amen want to be yoked with somebody who doesn't even believe in life they don't even understand life maybe they've rejected life verbally by their actions maybe they just don't know but when they're not saved they're not born again why would you want to partake in that right that means that you are part of that death that dark you're a part of that darkness because light and darkness cannot coexist i i cannot when i was when i became a christian i could not continue with the friends that i used to have brother wade i'm sure the same you say the same thing with you you can continue with your drinking buddies i can continue with the people because we are not compatible anymore they talk about death i mean they're not talking about death but i mean that's that's what's coming out of their life that's what they're expressing but here i am i'm trying to express life and it's incompatible that's why a christian and a non-christian who are like boyfriend and girlfriend going out that means they're both of the same they believe the same thing if you're get going along with the with the person and and just hanging out and you just you you nothing bothers you amen that means you're part of the same mold i'm sorry to say but that's the truth now somebody might say well you know they finally will eventually come you know and become christians you don't know that right why would you want to play with something that's not even sure i want to play with something sure amen i want to play with with with light amen that that's that's that's eternal that's sure amen but why would i want to mess with something that's unsecure why would you want to go inside a vehicle maybe i'm talking to our young people why do you want to go inside a vehicle that you know amen the tires are kind of half loose you know and take a a a trip to uh alabama and and like you know you know that that car something's gonna happen but yet you still get in it we still get in it as adults we still get into situations that are rocky and unsecured but yet we still encourage encourage it we still fall into it got to be careful that's why the bible clearly says be not unequally yo together with unbelievers those that are heading to a certain destination but sometimes we just encourage it and we just we just and then we wonder why is my son or my daughter going the same route for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness what fellowship there's no righteous there's no i can't there's nothing for me to discuss with a with an unbelieving girl that i and i'm trying to be a servant a god as a christian with an unbelieving girl it doesn't i don't know what's what compatibility is there and what communion what communion hath light with darkness all right i am not saying this is the bible telling you this you get mad with the word if it hurts i hope it does and what concord hath christ with belial belial was a god that they used to worship back again or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel it doesn't make any sense that's why when you see for example you thought this is a christian going out with such and such in person you question it because it doesn't make any sense that means they're just somebody's pulling somebody else and most of the time it's the non-christian pulling the so-called christian next first john chapter 3 verse 15 whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer now watch going back to who who has this eternal life and who doesn't whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life that word eternal life there is zoe amen it has they don't have eternal life abiding in him a murderer doesn't have eternal life abiding in him right first john 5 11 to verse 12 and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life zoe and this life zoe is in his son it's not in anybody else it's not in any other program it's in christ amen and his son he that hath the son hath life zoe and he that hath not the son of god hath not life it's clear as day right amen you're part of god you have eternal life you're not part of god you don't have eternal life and and what is your destination it's death amen amen praise god next brother branham says you might wonder now when you can use that word eternal and not use it the way we have been taught that is easy when it applies to god it means to be without beginning or end and ever enduring and never ceasing and when you talk of eternal life you have that in mind which is the life of god this is the record that god has given us eternal life and that life is in the sun we just now read this that verse he that hath the son hath life now then only watch only sons of god have life eternal the kind that never had a beginning but always was that means they're not destined to a hell all right they're not destined to lake of fire why because that eternal life has already conquered all that that eternal life in you has conquered all that already amen praise god glory next brother batman says here you have something in you right now that is eternal without beginning or end it is the spirit of god it is part of god himself it is the life of god amen so how can that life exist in hell now if a sinner is going to go to hell and then suffer the same as you are going to heaven and enjoy heaven then he has the same kind of life you have already amen praise god so it can't be it can't be there's does it just doesn't make any sense that it that a sinner is enjoying eternal life the same eternal life that you and i have because eternal life comes from the same source and that's god amen next all right now revelations chapter 20 i'm going to go a little quicker here revelation chapter 20 satan has to be cast into the lake of fire and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire now this is not hell this is the lake of fire this is the second death okay and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever uh not now this is where they they ask you but look what it says there it says forever day day and night forever and ever right all right well let's keep reading this is forever and ever and this verse sounds like it it's for eternity but next in the same chapter in just a few verses down you read and the sea gave up the dead which were in it this is coming this is coming into the white throne judgment in other words this is that the the the resurrection amen that this is that resurrection of the uh and they're coming to be uh judged at the white throne judgment and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them right death and hell in other words the hell that they were in let's just say judas let's just say judas judas is in hell right now right in a constant torment now i don't believe it's a physical place i believe it's just a state a state that it's in he's in they will be delivered from that in other words they will be taken from that and be and be brought and they were and they were brought to this white throne judgment amen and they were judged every man according to their works at that point you're going to have to depend on on the works that you did in order to get eternal life again i don't want to play with something that's that's unstable i don't want to get an unstable vehicle amen i want to get in something solid i want to get something solid right now amen and death and watch in verse 14 and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire we already read this verse a while ago this is the second death now this is the that this is where also the dead will go to as well when if they don't get eternal life in the white throne judgment and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire amen that's the second death they had their first death they were they had their first death they went to hell now they've been now they're judged at the white throne judgment and if there don't make it there they're going to be annihilated completely that's the order of things amen aren't you glad that god is in your life amen amen the the believer is not destined to be at the white throne judgment to be judged they will be judging but not to be judged you and i are going to be part of that judging because watch the bible says in one place it says don't you know that you and i will be judging uh angels that's right amen and some of these cases that that for example you changed some some unbeliever might have helped changed your tire while you were a sister that didn't you know was not able to help herself as her tower went flat and an unbeliever came in they gave you that cup of water they helped you as a bride member you will be part in that judge you will be part of that to help give eternal life to that person and they didn't even know it they didn't even know next now let's compare revelations chapter 20 verse 10 to this verse um revelations 22 5 and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign forever and ever now in in the previous in the brother brother anderson or brother bob can you go back to two slides next previous you see where it talks about satan thrown the devil the seed thrown to the lake of fire tormented day and night forever and ever that same forever and ever is the same forever and ever and the verse that we just read amen let's just let's just look at something here just a moment next next amen they shall reign forever and ever amen next all right the phrase forever and ever next the phrase ever and ever sounds like it could just mean eternity and even in the greek it denotes that when you read it in the greek but it also means a space of time and see below this is the this is the actual word aeon and it's forever an unbroken age perpetuity of time eternity the world's universe or a period of time or age so so those are the two same that same word that same phrase is the same word in those two is those two verses in other words in chapter 20 verse 10 there's a period of time for satan to be in that lake of fire or in that amen that's where actually that's where he's completely destroyed amen this same phrase is used in both revelations 2010 and revelations 2013-15 that we just read amen next all right so what random says here in questions and answers now to get the word forever look at the look at the aeon did you notice here in the bible how many has ever heard it said and aeons and aeons and how many knows that aeon is a space of time why sure anybody knows that aeon is the space of time and they shall burn for aeons that spaces of time cast into the lake of fire and shall burn for aeons aeons means the spaces of time they may burn for a hundred million years in punishment but finally they have to come to an end to be extinct altogether you see so uh they they could burn in that lake of fire for for for aeons but they're not going to be burnt for eternity aeons and eternity is two separate things amen remember eternity comes from god amen see because everything that is not perfect is the perverted off of the off of the perfect and it had a beginning so it must have an end next but we who believe on the lord jesus christ has zoe god's own life in us and have eternal life not have life forever and ever the sinner has life forever and ever but we have eternal life amen so you see the difference between forever and ever and the eternal life is two different two different things get here where where he's at so that i make sure i'm all right okay so satan will also have his time in hell before being cast into the lake of fire in revelations chapter 20 verse 2 to 3 and he laid hold on the dragon the lord that old serpent which is the devil and satan bound him a thousand years this is during the millennial reign that we're to be here on earth satan will be bound in other words he will be in his hell he will be in his perpetual torment just like he's you know he has helped others be in that perpetual torment you know he'll be in his perpetual torment you know or in his in his torment but it's go it's got it's got a time limit it's going to expire in thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit now it's interesting to use his bottomless pit because that's what hell is it's a it's a constant feeling that you're i mean you're just falling and there's no end can you imagine that amen who's ever had a dream that you're falling and and that you just there's no ending there's no stopping to that it's terrible i've never had it but i heard it i heard it's bad it's terrible right but that's what hell is it's a bottomless pit and shut him up shut satan up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more so during that time there will be no effect from satan amen oh you will see no effects from satan the way the earth was supposed to be before sin came into place that's how the earth will be during that time amen the nation he will deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little seasoned amen so that's another topic for another day next all right how many has learned something amen amen [Applause] all right in summary i was when i was put in this slide right here i was i was like should i put a picture of hell there like no i'd rather put a picture of life put a picture of eternal life it means usually when you when you see uh you know the topic of hell you know and they they make it really interesting like smokey and and hell and a big old cave and satan horns and all kind of to try to bring the attention well oh this should bring the attention of the believer amen in summary god is the only source of eternal life all right that means there's no beginning and no end and that eternal life should be in you and me as believers right next there is no way that death hell and sinners will live eternally being punished it doesn't it doesn't make any sense because that means that they have to have the same eternal life that you have and god doesn't work that way and it doesn't it doesn't agree with the word amen death hell and sinners have a beginning therefore they have to have an end god who is eternal life never had a beginning and never will have an end right and that means that you don't have an end if god is in you amen next the sinner at this time is being is at this time is being tormented in hell right and even the future ones that will die without christ that's where they're heading to a bottomless pit right right now but that torment will have to cease according to revelations chapter 20 verse 13. we just clearly read amen it that they will they will it will cease because hell is going to be thrown into the lake of fire to be to be no more next satan is heading to the same place not to be tormented day and night throughout all eternity because that means brother branham said in one place that means he'd be your brother if satan is to be tormented as in hell forever with pitchforks and and and tormentary that means he has eternal life and we know satan can't have eternal life amen because that means he would be your brother we're brothers and sisters in the lord because we have we share the same eternal life we share the same father where it comes from amen that's why we're brothers and sisters but if satan is your brother i'm sorry amen amen tormented day and night and you know what saints nowadays that's what the world is playing with i don't know if you saw this latest video that came out the the other day this rap song by little nas i believe it is and and he came out uh it's it's incredible what they what they display now but he's actually having sex with the devil and uh and he this rapper he's a homosexual so you can you can keep in your mind what's going on in the video this is what happening what's happening or what they're trying to portray and so he comes out with a line of shoes of sneakers that have a nike logo on it which i believe nike didn't didn't say that they could produce those those those shoes but they apparently supposedly have some a drop of blood human blood or something like that within them or something and their their goal was to sell 666 pairs which i believe they did i don't know if they did in two minutes in two minutes they sold that this is how the world is so deceived they play with satan like it's like it's like it's nothing like it's a game like it's like it's a and uh and the world is heading towards this condition if they don't get right if god doesn't come in their life and satan is just back there laughing you know but he laughs just as much as people that disbelieve the word of god people people that con that go round and round with these doctrines and all these things like that he laughs just as even loud then he's already got the whole world he's got him bamboozled with shoes with blood on him human blood on it but the ones that supposedly believe this word and are leaving this word he's probably laughing at them even worse because he at least the demons they believe in god and tremble some of these people they they thought they believe in god and they don't even they they just throwing out their their life away amen the only thing you can do is pray for them that's that's all you can do there's nothing else you can do satan is heading to the same place not to be tormented day and night throughout all eternity but to also be annihilated for good amen amen thank god next by you having eternal life in your soul you have already conquered death hell satan and the second death none of these things can ever harm the believer amen praise god give the lord a copper praise if you're i'm thankful you have that power lying within you right now amen next and brother brown says here just to finish off i believe this is the last slide abram says here we all know that the second death is the lake of fire revelations 2014 and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death of course that means all those who were therein were cast into the lake of fire now then i want to bring out something here for you it no doubt will cause people to comment on my strange doctrine which is not his strange doctrine the bible declares it but see that's what you have to watch brother branham was pretty much alone proclaiming this in his day all denominations believed that there was an eternal hell and that sinners were right now being burning in hell eternally roasting in an everlasting eternal roasting and brother branham preached against this because it was a doctrine from hell from the pits of hell it was from satan but watch but i stand here on the authority of the word of god and deny that the unbeliever goes to an eternal hell and burns there eternally and you know what i stand with him amen because i i don't see it any other way i don't say it any other way amen that's that's uh that is uh that's that's the last slide brother so i hope that something was said this tonight that would help you and uh when you are seeing these images of hell coming across your screens and across your your youtube uh videos and just bombarding all our children you know it's um think of it where it comes from and take it more more seriously amen let's take that more seriously as parents amen do it in a wise manner amen but take it seriously amen because this fourth dimension is real fourth dimension i mean all these images of demons zombies and everything else and they're very slightly coming in and taking trying to steal our children's minds by making it cute making it like like smiley cats and all these kinds of things but there's a spirit behind those things that leads to to uh that come from the bottomless pit which is hell so i hope something has helped that was said that would help you amen stand to our feet praise the lord praise the lord if we got through the content you always think you're not going to get through it in time but amen but let's sing something brother on these things and uh just reflect back to that eternal life amen that god amen that you have in god amen we just thank god for that praise the lord what do we have lord jesus can satisfy your soul amen the world will try to satisfy [Music] is [Music] holy jesus satisfied it's all in him holy jesus [Music] make you [Music] jesus amen just think about it tonight as we sing that next verse if you don't know the lord tonight this is the don't wait till tomorrow don't wait till next week don't wait till amen make it right now make it right now see god

he will give you peace [Music] the heavenly father you've already purchased the lord [Music] and you [Music] once again [Music] make you he'll give you peace amen praise the lord i i don't find any other refuge or joy but in that in jesus amen he's the only thing that can really truly change your heart change your soul and if you haven't experienced it you have the opportunity to do so amen talk to a person that you trust amen it doesn't have to be me it doesn't have to be a brother dale but somebody that you believe is godly amen and say i want to know more amen amen you know in in in esther's case the other day she was talking to zach i mean how did you you how would you think that you would be part of of her getting the new birth see see we don't know who we can influence with our life amen so you just that's why we have to be salty amen at every at every every cause every way amen all hearts and minds clear i just want to make known really quick the money that that was picked by uh that the church gave to help uh build the uh the home for the family they received it a couple of weeks ago and they're giving me updates as to when they started a building i told them they don't have to do that just give me the finished uh the finished project and that when they do that send me pictures send me videos and i'll we'll show them to you all but they told me to tell you all that they're so thankful and that god bless you and uh really appreciate appreciate it they don't know what to do they don't know what to say they're just very appreciative and it really it really is going to help them and quite tremendously so we just thank god bro thank god for brother dale and and his heart amen to want to help out in that and each and every one of you who who individually helped as well to give amen god bless each and every one of you amen let's just go to the lord in prayer and let's be dismissed our heavenly father we thank you once again for the opportunity to serve
