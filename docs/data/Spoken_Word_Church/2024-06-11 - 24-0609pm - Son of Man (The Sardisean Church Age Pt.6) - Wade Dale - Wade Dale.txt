the fur of this service in Jesus name we pray pray amen God bless you let's see Revel see Revelations now we got it back to the white we got white screen now so Revelations 1:10 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest right in the book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia ephus Mna pergamus th Sardis Philadelphia latosa now what John toped the bride right so God told him to write this in the book and send it to the bride yes so he sent this to me and you this is ours this and you say well I wasn't in Ephesus or yeah you were the same Holy Spirit you got inside of you is the same one that's inside of those people in Ephesus smrna perus Tara it just that that was a different word not a different different word but a different part of the word that they fulfill versus what you're fulfilling but today we got to fulfill it all seven course meal you've heard many times before seven we've got all Seven Ages we've got all the all the accolades and all the all the bad stuff too so um you know God hates as he he hates this this last age he hates the people that are uh lukewarm that that are not as brother Ryan was saying that don't have a passion to uh to come to church anymore it's just like well if I get here one time then I'm all right I don't have to come back again but I don't know brother Claud always told me one time and I agree you preach to everybody on Sunday morning people come in they think they come to church you know just because they're going to church but you're really preaching to the real true ones that want to hear the second service so we going to hear something today CU you came back praise the Lord I glad you didn't come to see me but you didn't have to say Amen who said that sister Trudy the one that's got the head her head down and y'all laughed you should have rebuked her and you're laughing that's all right sister you just said what everybody else was thinking in their mind and I turned to see the voice that SP to me and behold I turned and saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of those candlesticks I saw one liken the son of man now look son of man that Revelation had not been given yet all right like Brother Richard was talking about Sunday that Revelation is only to the first age and the last age the son of man himself stood in the first part of the first age all right are the end of the Old Testament here we are standing at the end of the New Testament and that same son of man but he decided he was going to come as one person there but he decided down here he going to come in a many membered body all right in the fullness of the word and that's what we're that's why I love these last three ages and we'll read it not today but brother rown said these last three ages completes the birth see it starts with justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then what and then the word coming forth at the Eagle age at to end time taking us out of here so he was clothed with a garment down to the foot and GED about the PS with a golden girdle which is feminis let's read this and then we'll sit down to the angel of the church in Sardis write these things sayith he that have the seven spirits of God God wants to reiterate he still got these things in control all right he's still in control of all these things and the Seven Stars I know the works that thou has a name that thou livest and art dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God all right remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come as a thief in the night and thou shalt know not know what hour I will come upon thee remember all 10 virgins heard the voice to wake up all 10 right five did something different than the other five did though they all heard one voice we've all heard let's just put it this we've always we've all heard the voice of the seventh angel messenger but have he re have we really trimmed our lamp yes we have but have we really got the oil of the Holy Ghost to take us out of here that's something for you to think about cuz we'll talk about the outer Court in just a minute that's why I like these last three ages you can put it in the birth of of you and put it in the the birth of the of the world and all the different things so we'll look at in just a minute that's why brother B said the last three completes the birth it wasn't that they didn't listen one more time I'm not saying they did not have the new birth they had the new birth in every age every age had a dip in the Holy Ghost every age we're born again Christians going to be resurrected when we call them out of the Grave they're going to come right here and then we're going to go to Glory together and they're going to live in the city all seven Church ages but there was some that looked really bad and there was something that looked really good well this age is the worst it looked really really bad watch remember what brother R said about the if that second preview of The Bride had to come blind wretched miserable naked and don't know it but praise God he's brought us back to a place he said I will restore and he's restoring now he's continuing to restore he's bringing the word of God back I don't care if you don't see it that don't matter it's coming back it is back remember therefore how thou Hast received D and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life you know that we had a group that's blotted out of the book of life amen Judas Judas brother Bri his name was written on the book what not wasn't the Lamb's Book but it written in the Book of Life or Lamb's Book of Life but not the Eternal section but it was erased we don't want to go that far and get erased I don't like being erased I like me being erased but I don't I don't want to be erased in God I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father can you confess that you're a Believer can you confess today that you're part of this message of the hour you're part of the bride and that brother random was the prophet messenger that were supposed to listen to not somebody else he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches you can be seated the Lord His blessings to the reading of the word now as we were talking this morning we'll we'll skip through a bunch as we're almost to the we're at the fifth Church age and we'll go back when we do the seals and talk about a little bit more but if you'll see that Paul irenius Martin Columba if you'll see the darkness continuing to creep through and then Columba then Luther is a little more coming out out a little more coming out Wesley and then remember though in this last age it's gross Darkness brother brandom said I put a little bit of that light in there he said the angel blacked it all the way out all right so guess what that little part of light is me and you all right that's why I identify every people like there was a brother the other day was we were talking about the church in Daniel 70 weeks and he said all that some man's CH I said praise God that some man was William brand he was a prophet of the end time that's all right with me that that he drew that and then the angel backed it up by drawing it on the Black by drawing it on the wall behind the Tabernacle all right so we know that it's been what it's been Vindicated this message has been Vindicated that it's true all right I don't need I don't need somebody else to tell me that it's been Vindicated and if it's been Vindicated guess what it's the word of God for the day and hour that I'm living in yes technology I don't know so much I'm stuck wait a minute I got it so we know all those churches every church that's why when when we look at the end at the beginning of the all of time in Adam and Eve Eve was what Eve was submissive she was supposed to be under her head but she began to come out from under her head and she became as a spirit of a dominating female because she wanted to know what the beasts wanted with her rather than what the headship of God did all right so that that and that if that's what killed us then the headship of the church is what's got to bring us back getting back under that headship of Christ knowing who he is knowing what he wants his we are his potentials as brother Randon was telling us but that dominating female that church is dominated listen we don't want a church to dominate us we want our headship Christ to dominate us and not dominate us with with a fist of iron but with what nail scarred hands right all right but that's what killed all those Church ages the dominating female took over and dominated the whole thing the church especially in the fourth Church age when she took over and she said this is it and that became informed the Catholic church and you had to listen or you die or you had to conform or you died all right but she that liveth in pleasure now watch well I've read this 10 times but listen she that liveth in pleasure not she this liveth in darkness and and you know uh homeless and under a under a um a bridge no she's living in pleasure she thinks she's building the best churches she's building the best organization she's she's you know writing the best books and she's giving the best TV programs and she's given all her best but she's dead without the word of God why brother R said many times I'd rather have the word of God eat soda crackers and drink water can you say that really that you'd rather have the word of God than the meal you're getting ready to eat in a few minutes or an hour or so I didn't think so you're know amen opening the first two seals it looses a Ministry so if if God looses a Ministry then Satan looses one right by behind him all right everybody with me on that so the what he loosed what God loosed in that first church age Satan looked and said man they're good I'm G to have to really be sharp I can't just act like I've been acting before I got to be real sharp I got to get in that church and not just look at it I got to get in it I got to get involved in that church in that in the in the Church of God the Church of Christ not the Church of Christ denomination but the church that Christ set up on the day of Pentecost I got to be a part of that don't you think listen Satan didn't take a vacation when them 120 in the upper room receive the Holy Ghost he wasn't going off somewhere he was standing right there the problem was brother Kylie he couldn't get what they got he said I got need that I feel that power I can I just can't get a hold of it I hate that thing now so I'm going to get as close as I can to it and as if if God loes something I'm gonna lose something right behind him because remember Satan's not an originator right Satan perverts what's already been spoken so if God hadn't given us a real white righteous Church a real one that first church age was white they had no denomination behind it sure they had little sayings and that's what we'll get to a little bit there was a saying went out then it was a deed and then it was a Doctrine and then they crowned that Doctrine into a pope that's how it starts when one of my other favorite scriptures is in James where it says when lust is conceived it brings forth sin When sin is finished finished it brings forth death so you got four stages there we know we're all born in sin amen but when it's finished when when we become a part of that it becomes death right sure it's death to begin with but when lust is conceived it brings forth sin when sin's finished in other words you continue into it yes it brings forth death absolutely we're all born in sin we're all born dead but we don't have to continue in it we can come out of her my people as we're going to read here in just a few minutes Revelation 6 verse1 so God's going to the Lamb's going to stand and open a seal a white horse rider goes out but remember one of the four beasts the lion first thing he said was was come and see when what was the lion the lion was the spirit in the first three Church ages that was bold and it was pure and it was good and it was powerful and it roared through Three Ages but God sent a a lion out but Satan sends a horse out a white horse you watch him though he started out white went to black red black and pale he didn't start out black he's shrewd he's shrewd with me and you he's shrewd he's a bluffer he had a bow but no arrows and was Crown was given to him and he went forth conquering what did he do he conquered all those first three Church ages he conquered every one of those doctrines that were true he made a false one out of it or he took man and state and put or church and state and put them together and made instead of making mythology Greek mythology has been around for a long time Zeus and Thor and all the different things if you read up in the history man the Roman Catholic Church they just said hey everybody everybody likes that they love Diana remember they they stood for six some of y'all try that for God they stood six hours one day and said hail Diana hail di for 6 hours to a pagan God we can't sit for an hour and listen to God we ought to be ashamed why they had you know why cuz maybe sometime somewhere somebody got lucky and looked at Diana and and and God give them some money or something or not God but their God give him some money or or done something they want to put listen they want to put her up there if they went something went on hadn't went on each one of them if there that God put up there it's because somewhere in the line they got something from that God or something happened when that God was there or they wouldn't be the God right but we know it's all false and we know that the Catholic Church all they done was they said hey that's popular let's pull it in here and let's let's make it Paul Peter and all the different ones so he bluffed his way into the true church just a saying though had no power to it cuz he only had a bow he said well maybe maybe you know Jesus was was I think he had to go to the bathroom and the Bible said he cried he can't be God he's got to be another person see how simple that is but it's very simple to realize that the Bible in the Old Testament said behold oh Israel the Lord our God is one and that's it I don't need explaining anymore he's one God with many manifestations but they're like no he can't be that and be this or this and this and this let's put him in three three three personalities let's split him up that was a saying and you know what that saying did that saying was preached in church services until somebody caught that and it wasn't a revelation from God that's why I say Satan sits in this congregation just like y'all do amen and he don't sleep Revelation 6:3 and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast or what another Ministry another power right another Ministry was loosed cuz they they needed it to get through that dark Church age to get through that long Church age they needed an ox Spirit to work just a little bit back and forth work work work cuz it was a long Church age and they were going to all die and they went out another horse another Ministry that was red and power was giving him set there to take peace from the earth look what happened look at all the wars if you take from from about 600 AD to even to now look how many wars there's been how many hundreds of thousands of millions of people been killed because of wars that red horse is still riding folks it's still riding now that's what's taking peace from the your Earth yes right that's taking peace from your Earth you're letting that red horse Rider ride through your life get him out of there you don't need him anymore you don't need you don't need that kind of horse and there was given unto him a great sword or a great wor so now that that saying now has become a deed let's get together and let's start doing these things now let's go to the second seal when the slain risen lamb opened in the second cathot beast said come and see what that seal mystery is now we get it the lamb you remember has to open every seal we'll get to that later on when we get to the seals if you notice in the routine of where we just went through in other words every age the routine first was a lion the next was a ox you see and this Beast said come see now when the lamb opened to seal then what John went to sea so listen if John went to sea and he types A bride guess what we're supposed to be able to see the seals that open I the only time you're blind is because you blind yourself the only time you're blind is you let Satan put his hands in front of your eyes all right because the Bible tells us there was a group of people that saw what was going on and withstood that pressure withstood Satan to what happened let's see what he found out come see there's a mystery what was the mystery the mystery was that the world thought that Constantine was a wonderful guy he brought two things together and look how it flourished and and they got rid of them old people that that that believe different than they did yeah 68 million true Christians died though look at your look at your read your history I remember about studying about Constantine where church and state was brought together how it was a wonderful guy and he wanted to get everybody together he wanted everybody to be one well he was the worst thing that ever happened he was just like Jezebel and Ahab that's what brother rer said so a red horse goes out now notice that they should kill one another they should kill each other his bow had no arrows at first but his great sword did he done his killing later and changed from a white horse to a red horse the same exact Devil with a sword he's going forth with a sword in his hand or a word now listen that word hadn't stopped either that word developed into a doctrine that Doctrine developed into a pope sitting over there in Rome all right everybody with me waiting through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him you think we have little little spats when people don't agree with you it meant death in that age it's real death they killed you now do you understand it how many understand what that seal is now what it was the opening of the of the red horse rider going through the church age of the tharan church age and who did it the Catholic church but it was Satan sitting on the on the horse but he was doing it through the people this Rider and all his kingdom subjects that are slain down through the age that's draw all this Blood Of Martyrs of the Saints will be slain By The Sword of Jesus Christ when he comes we'll talk later on about the vs but the vs is what God the vows is a wrath of God you don't believe there's a wrath of God don't hang around but read your Bible don't hang around for the wrath of God to be poured out cuz I promise you he's an Angry God when you don't do what he say say all right that's why I want to be sealed away in him if you're sealed away in him and judged in him then you can't he can't judge yourself wrong amen he's a righteous judge but he can't judge yourself wrong but he can judge you wrong if you're not in him that's right right they took the sword of dogma and Antichrist and cut down the real true worshipper all down Through the Ages by the millions and when Christ comes with a sword in other words go over in the Book of Daniel he's going to stand and fight for is he's going to destroy this place and level it he will slay every enemy before him kill the enemy now first he had a bow no arrows he's got a mighty sword in his hand now he can do anything now so he jumps off his White Horse now he straddles a red horse blood blood red he really rides that one why for 900 years he rode that and he developed during that time he develop doctrines that people still go by now amen I mean that n see en couns so they wrote all that stuff down and that's what they go by the Apostles Creed that people read the the worship of Mary uh that Jesus wasn't God that he was a like substance and maybe a second person and and they really didn't know who the Holy Ghost was so they made it a third person listen it's more hard to explain the Trinity than it is just say God's one if you keep reading in history and I read about that one the man in N that was the one the book about NAA and naan counsil he said it was hard for them to explain that the theologians during the time didn't understand it they just took it as as Doctrine and they said oh must be a trinity he's three he's got three personalities they even had one picture of him one God with three heads on it one looking that way one looking that way one looking that way with one body and people accepted it though that's the whole thing if you accept the doctrine you become that Doctrine right amen listen I want the doctrine of Christ that way I can be Christ if I accept that Doctrine the real Doctrine the true Doctrine which we have in this end time then you are Christ and you are under his Doctrine listen brother Brown said a church without a Doctrine is not a church so we got a Doctrine this Doctrine in this church has been that the word is prevalent above all amen prevalent above everything the word of God and the truth of the word of God over everything the word of God is true it will stand true is true going to be true and will never [Applause] fail if I stand here long enough it'll be the same way we're going to put the word first the word of God is going to be taught you can you can like those preachers that jump up and down and shout and all that other stuff that's okay that's why they call special meetings and I appreciate them and I like them but the teaching of the word the teaching of the word is done how many of you been in a school room and the teacher teaching you and you're shouting and running all over the place no you sit and listen you sit and listen and then as brother Joe and I were talking a few minutes ago he said there's things that I heard you know 30 years ago in other words somebody say something else though and God was Park that right back it's like you maybe not even listen to it subliminally listen the Holy Ghost Inside of You never missed a lick put it in in U southern English he never listen the Holy Ghost is not doesn't have gaps in his mind he don't have dementia that's right he said he'd bring it back to your remembrance and teach you things to come so we may not get it today but tomorrow we may get it we may get it in two weeks we may get in the year amen that's why like a fivefold Ministry it comes out from five different angles five different angles of the same story though it's like Matthew Mark Luke and John was four commentaries of the same thing that's going on one saw two Blind Men the other saw one doesn't make the word wrong it just makes it at a different angle that you can see it so it started out it become a it was a saying and now it's going to be a deed in this fourth Church age the fifth Church age coming in it's going to be a Doctrine it's going to be something that they're going to do and it's going to be something they do in a church because a Doctrine without a church is not a church so a they have a Doctrine out there every Church there Baptists have a Doctrine methodists have a Doctrine we're fixing to leave here in a little while and go to a Methodist Church and come out of the United Methodist but there's a old football coach of mine is preaching there so he they asked us some of the old football players to come so we're going to go and listen to him speak at the U Methodist Church down in Homer and um or New Salem and and um you know what I wouldn't go to that denomination of Church you went to a denomination of horor church to yourself you come out of something amen so maybe we can go in there and get somebody out amen amen I'm not going to go in there and say oh I believe in a trinity now folks now if they ask me I'm say I believe in one God but they came out of that Methodist movement so they don't have pastors anymore the pastors that believed in that um you know all that women preachers and and homosexuals and all that they've left and they this this church has come out and separated their s you know what God honor that whether they're in that system or not he's going to honor them for not going into that system and be that United Methodist so now what they're doing is they're looking for preachers cuz all the preachers left cuz you know what because of money amen the United Methodist Church is huge they got a lot of money so they can pay the people that's the same thing a Catholic Church set up thousands of years ago we'll pay you better if you'll just say what we say Matthew 6 ver 23 if therefore the light that's in you be Darkness how great is that Darkness we read that this morning so let let's go to the sardian church AG just for a minute let's get into something right here because remember this church age Begins the age of of reformation all right now to reform somebody you send somebody kid to a reformed school it really don't do them any good until they get restored okay so a Reformation sure it's part way out but if you reform an alcoholic an alcoholic goes through a 12-step process but they always tell you we're going to teach you how to become formed but you're always an alcoholic you always going to not need to be around alcohol you always this and that and the other no no no you get the born you get the Born Again experience you get the new birth you've been restored that thing's gone sir you can set a 100 beers in front of you if you want to doesn't matter not going to hurt you but but so Reformation is then some of it came out some of it stayed in or the people that came out took some of it with them okay but not in this age m not in this age cuz it's required what full Revelation in this age so God said I Know Thy Works thou Hast a name that thou livest and our dead so they came out of that that they came out of that middle Church age and they started saying I'm Baptist I'm Methodist not Methodist but I'm this and I'm that and I'm this and it developed on up into Wesley you got the lutherans and then you got the Wesleyan and then the wesle of the methodists and you you got a name that you're living by but you're dead amen I just want to be bride bride is it m Jesus Christ amen Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain in other words you got a little hope you got a little strength use it that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God other words Luther brought out a denominational idea called the Trinity because he believed in the trinity but he didn't believe in justification like they did he believed in justification by faith not by Penance that you did so that one little work of God he was pleased with it just like I said this morning brother Brown said God was pleased with that all right they'll have some few names in stst which have not defiled their garments they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy so there's a worthy group in every age even in this bad old church age called leosa so now the combat Beast we're we're getting out of the the Ox age and we're coming into the age of man or intelligence where that you don't just work the ox works the ox works the ox works well now you come to the man age he makes a car or a tractor or where you don't have to plow with a mule you plow with a tractor all right so the intelligence of man but what came first the intelligence of God yes God is going to now start using man again not not that he didn't use them before but I'm talking about to restore cuz remember this is Reformation but it is the beginning of restoration I will restore I'll read it to you in just a minute all right so we see the age coming up we'll go back through that they were the escaped ones they were the first people that really broke away cuz Hey listen during that 900 years you said one thing against the Catholic Church you died but there was a group of people somewhere that met in houses met in caves met in different places that kept the word of God alive same way with us there's all kind of denominations on every on every corner but God's going to keep his word alive and I'm just going to say we're part of that word that broke with Papa Rome that actually flourished it didn't die you know why cuz God had a purpose amen no doubt caused the Jezebel propheus to consolidate and emphasize her doct of marry or mariology in deciding decided opposition to the Protestants who denied her any part whatsoever in the Plan of Salvation thank God they had a group of people said no Mary ain't God she ain't the mother of God she didn't have sin she's dead she had to go to Pentecost to get the Holy Ghost as Luther crystallized the doctrine of justification by faith they held to works there's always opposition Penance prayers and other unscriptural means and as the freed Christians glorified the son the Roman Catholics they glor what took the took the vision off the son and put it on the mother well that was nothing more than what I said before they put it on a dominating female spirit that Mary now is above Jesus cuz she's nicer or more nice yeah me too Lord have mercy you got that right but they believe that they do it all the time they pray to Mary they don't even pray to Jesus anymore they pray to Mary pop P literally exalted married the glorification in a resurrected body now that and if you'll read that Nia book he he calls it Bible Acts because it ain't in the Bible but it's extra part of the Bible That's Roman Catholics there's nowh that Mary was glorified and and had a resurrected body but the Catholic Church put it in the X part of the Bible that she did there's no foundation for a lot of this that's why they took the Bibles out of the people's hand that's why they took and put everything in Latin and says hey you just believe that priest you just believe that Pope don't let somebody study this thing out cuz you ain't going to find it in the Bible let's take this away what Nicko ISM take the power away from the people and put it in a pope yeah the doctrine is absolutely the Babylonia want of the son carrying the mother bodily and to Heaven Martin Luther was the man we saw what he did he had some problems but he was the church age messenger for that age and I love this letter because he wrote this letter to the pope this is like this is like writing it to God that they saw because they thought he was God they thought listen a Pope's infallible according to the Catholic church if he says start a war you start a war there is no question that's right if he says we're going to change Doctrine we're going to change Doctrine if he says we're going to do this we're going to stop War we're going to start War we're going to do this that's why when he stands up over there when we're gone he stands up over there incarnate he says I'm God and he shows signs and wonders to where the world's going to believe him yes believe him and the Holy Ghost is going to be nowhere to be found but it's a spirit that he takes so you think about a man that was brought up in the Catholic Church brought up in this system God gives him a revel ation and he comes out and he writes this to supposedly to his head guy or to God the first and chief article is this Jesus Christ Our Lord and God died for our sins and was raised again for our justification he alone is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world well right there see he's pulled apart yes sir cuz the Pope's one that's supposed to be one that forgives and okay he alone is the Lamb of God look he alone he wrote it specifically he alone is the Lamb of God takes away the son of the world and God has laid on him the iniquity of us all all have sinned and are Justified freely there's another one he pulled he pulled Roots out without their own works and merits by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ in his blood this is necessary to believe this cannot be otherwise acquired or grasped by any work law Merit or no venius therefore it is clear and certain that this faith alone justifies us alone now he's writing this to the Pope the Pope's reading it he's mad cuz somebody has bucked the system somebody has come out of the normal and and without the grace of God though all that Pope would had to say he did he they tried to kill Martin Luther but God wouldn't let him he had a message praise God he's not done with us until he's done with us and they send the FBI CIA Messiah whatever they want to send that's okay that's right but Martin Luther stood there and said the just shall live by faith and this right here watch nothing of this article can be yielded or surrendered in other words I'm not going to write you you're not going to write me one and scare me and then I'm going to write one back and recant this is it this is written in stone it's it can be it can be yielded or surrendered nothing of this article even though Heaven and Earth and everything else Falls how about that and we know what he wrote to the followers so let's get right here this where we ended this morning let's talk about the Reformation he was against works as a means of Salvation and baptism as a means of regeneration in other words now what's you doing the the now what do the Catholics tell you you take the baby I saw those when we were working with them into plant soon as they had a baby they had to get that baby um sprinkled baptized or he was going to hell so that was means of regeneration didn't matter if the kid grew up and became Adolf Hitler he was baptized by the Catholic church so that put him in heaven well that's not what water baptism does right but see that's the ex Bible That's the ex Bible part of the part outside the Bible that the Catholic Church wrote he taught the mediation of Christ apart from man as was the original and Pentecostal concept and we read read what he did let's just continue through here now now what stirred his heart by the Holy Ghost and which was the little green shoot that signified that truth watch was coming back to the church as it was known at Pentecost was the doctrine of justification salvation by grace apart from works and he realized he didn't just preach that we know he didn't but that was what that was what I believe that the people caught they caught that and they come out said hey I don't have to do Penance I don't have to do all this all I got to do is believe in Jesus Christ and there was a big group of people came out he will be forever known as the instrument in the hand of God who revived this truth he was the fifth messenger and his message was the just shall live by faith now he preached and knew and did preach that we are to go from Faith to Faith so in other words he did preach a progressive revelation but it was just under his ministry just live by faith all right he didn't have to know the seals or the plagues or the vials or he still drank beer and He Still Smoked the pipe but he was a great man in the word for the day and hour that he lived in all right and he's listen he's one of those stars that God held in his hand now that can't be unworthy if God held those seven men and Luther was one of them he was happily pleased in what Martin Luther did not the things Martin Luther failed in listen if he it same with us if he took all our failures we just might as well go to the house but he looks inside of you and he sees the desire of your heart yes if the desire in your heart's there it'll come out he was a reformer not a prophet so he was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth as would a man like Paul or brother brandham who was both a and Prophet everybody with me some are not go don't go to nod that's where Cain went the word does not call it a restoration but certainly calls it Reformation had it been a restoration that age would have been what what's brother R saying if it was a a Pentecostal age back to Restoration Martin Luther would have said the just shall live by faith the father son Holy Ghost baptism is wrong no ET etal hell or eternal hell is wrong Purgatory is wrong all this is wrong that's what brother vom did this is wrong this is wrong this is wrong we're coming back we're coming back to this even the Pentecostals in 1906 they were trinitarians that thing was so strong God had to wink at their ignorance he had to wink at all that had it been a restoration that age would have been another Pentecostal but it was not the best they could say was strengthen that way which remains that is ready to die there was something missing oh yeah my there was something missing this age had justification but it Miss sanctification what's he saying that was for John Wesley Martin Luther was the just shall live by faith and we'll read it in just a minute you got to put that in your journey these last three ages is your journey in your birth all right that was God original plan what was like it was at Pentecost they were Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost listen to me the reason for being justified and Sanctified is to the end that you might be baptized with the Holy Ghost that's the reason there is a church it's the temple of God filled with God even the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that was in Jesus while he was here on Earth causing him to do those Mighty Works came back on the day of Pentecost and I say today it's in you and I this age did not have those words or they had the written word but not the revealed word that was a Reformation period but fear not little flock God said what I will restore now pay attention to that remember it was an unfulfilled AG let's go down where it's right here it says I will restore we'll start start right there oh let's read this right here watch Revelations 18 and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory now think about Luther Luther is preaching his message he's bringing light back the True Light Of God he's bringing it back but Babylon didn't come out Babylon is in bad shape Babylon the greatest Fallen become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit what what started in nah it incarnates a group of people in the end time for all nations look they got drunk with the wrath of her fornication they loved it they love this Catholic thing Hey listen that's that's why the Mafia likeed the Catholic Church they could go and do indulgences or get forgiven for the murders they were going to commit three days from now right confess to the priest the priest do whatever he does and then he says okay you're you're you you don't have to worry about that your sins are forgiven and of course they paid him a little cash to go with that that confession of Booth had probably had a little square in it like that where it could slide the money in it had to be pretty high CU it was a lot of money for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth the kings of the Earth the Great Men that committed fornication with her and the merchants in the Earth are waxed Rich to the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people look come out of her my people my people was in there brother John my people God said you're in that system but I'm going to send you somebody that's going to shout loud enough to say come out of her sir and I'm going to give you a reason to come out I'm going to give you something to lie not something dead that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins reached all the way into heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you double listen if they killed 68 million God's going to kill twice that many listen to what I'm saying reward her even as she reward Ed you and double unto her double according to her Works God's going to destroy this whole world folks that's s billion people 8 billion now in the cup which she hath filled filled to her double how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart I sit a queen and I'm no Widow and shall shall see no sorrow therefore shall her plagues come in one day death mourning famine she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is a lord god what who judgeth the great so look in the Feast of the trumpets watch here's brother random explaining the ages and explaining now listen real quick Shake Yourself the Holy Spirit has been bound by the denominations all these 2,000 years all right we find out it has now notice the sabbaths seven sabbaths now what's he talking about seven Church ages seven sevens is 49 all right you didn't come all the way out on a 49 you came out as Brother Richard was talking about on a 50 last Sunday 50 is a jubilee that everything goes free listen Luther came out but didn't get all the way free Wesley came out but didn't get all the way free Pentecost came out and didn't get all the way free but Hallelujah this age comes out and we have a 50 Jubilee we go all free this guy right here goes Hallelujah this out of court goes with it they couldn't get all the way out what do you mean they couldn't get all the doctrines out of their self they had to bring some of the doctrine with them the Bible said there'll be a day that will be neither night or day what the evening time it shall be light all scripture Jesus said must be fulfilled is that right congregation says amen the proph said there will be a day that can't be called day and night but in the evening time it shall be light I'll promise you one thing the light in you today is not Darkness the light in you today is the light of God it's the light of what he wanted before the foundation of the world this is what he's been looking for this is the day he's been looking for this is the people he's been looking for he took this one to this one bred that one to that one to that one to that one to get you here to get you here I will restore John 12:23 this is the whole reason listen to me just for a minute this is the whole reason God brought Luther and Wesley and Pentecost on that side of that Dark Age this side see we're on this side of the Dark Age Now Jesus answered said the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified now watch verely verely I say unto you except a corner of wheat now he's talking about himself but scripture has dual meaning right everybody with me scripture has dual meaning except the corn of wheat fall in the ground and die it abideth alone if Jesus had not had died like he did or was killed he would have been alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit so it had to go in the ground at n it had to go into the ground the true seed and but remember it wasn't dead though you just couldn't see it it was covered by so much denominational Darkness but that seed was still there amen and God promised I'll restore whatever that seed that went in the ground is going to come back up yes sir Joel 2:23 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain what is rain a message it's a message it's coming down from God what a message is supposed to ref precious this is not refreshing he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month both together former rains of what planting rain what's the last one the Harvest rain all right and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil overflow and I will restore to you the years that the Locust had eaten the canker worm the caterpillar the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall just barely get by no that says you shall eat in plenty and look and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God why cuz you see that restoration coming back you see that seed that went in the ground it's now made to be mature and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you amen you yes and my people shall never be ashamed don't be ashamed to be called a Christian don't be ashamed to be different from the world it's God's way yes and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed now look at we see it says right here and I will restore to you all right now I looked in the um Bible that had 26 translations I got it from Dad's library now watch mofet said I will make up to you for the years that those animals ate I'm going to make it up to you bride you've been through all that you've got through the Dark Ages you've come under justification you've come under sanctification you've come through Pentecost but I'm going to make it up to you what all these the Locust a the Locust lopping swarming leaping devouring the huge host I sent among you I'm going to make up for that I'm going to pour it out I'm going to pour it out hard in the end time but there's only a small group of people going to get it The New American Bible says look I will repay you now look God said a few minutes ago in Revelations 18 I'm going to repay her did you not hear that I'm going to repay her all the years that she fornicated and did all those things against God and killed my people but praise God he's going to repay us for the years that we fought and fought and fought and fought we fought for this thing it's a fight it's not a picnic a battleship not a cruise ship I will repay you God promised I'm going to not just restore I'm going to repay you yes for the years which the Locust has eaten the grasshopper the devour and the cutter we know it's the same bug different stages my great Army which I sent among you Ezekiel 47:2 says then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward and led me about the way without into the utter gate by the way that lookth Eastward oh who's coming from the East God's coming from the East and behold there ran out waters on the right side and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth Eastward he measured a th cubics and he brought me through the water and the waters were to the ankle again he measured a th000 and brought me through the water in other words he went another thousand furlongs or another thousand feet can you say another church age or two again he measured a thousand and brought me through he brought me through Ezekiel son of man prophesy okay I am the son of man for the end time you are too we're the son of man for the end time he's not coming in any other flesh but our flesh you can swallow hard if you want to but that's exactly what God wants us to be so he brought me through the waters now to the loins oh we're getting in some deep water afterwards he measured another thousand in other words we went on in our journey sister Rebecca we went further into our journey and we're still in the water we're still in the water I don't want to go I went to swim I didn't go to Wade I am Wade I didn't go let's go back again praise the Lord afterwards he measured a thousand look at the progression he went on out further he took me out further oh praise God I didn't see that to just now he took me out further Ezekiel but yeah me who's Ezekiel talking to he talking to me and afterwards he measured a thousand and it was a river that I couldn't pass over for the waters were risen Waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over and he said unto me me yes son of man hast thou seen this nobody's ever seen this before then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river in other words he took me back I'm sorry that's what he said he took me back in my memory to remember the journey that I had and how God brought me to my ankles he brought me to my loins he brought me to what a river that you what swim in you believe that that's three stages in the four St age he takes me back by the word of God and tells me this is your journey this is what you got to go through but you notice did you notice something in that passage azekel didn't drown he swam he swam back the angel took him back so he can swim in other words by that time you know how daddy taught us how to swim he took us out in the Martin hole throw us in the middle of it and said swim back you either do that or die so there's something comes up inside of you that says paddle swing your arms don't breathe into the water and you made it back maybe that's what God needs to do with us throw us out in the middle of the swimming hole no he didn't though you know what he done he took Ezekiel to the ankles said hey get used to this he took it to the loins he said hey get used to this right then he said hey now you know how to swim in other words you're acclimated to what I brought you here for you and I have a purpose and if you want to stay in the ankles that's okay but you're not going to get all of God you're not going to get all of that blessing huj this is Brother brand I'm explaining to the lutherans of this age in the sardian church age somebody asked him said brother R said we want the Holy Ghost this is Lutheran do you think we've got it I said potentially you are believing unto it he said what do you mean potentially we are hungry for God we read a book on Pentecost and the gifts of the Spirit so some of us flew to California to see the author and when we got there he told us that though he had written the book he did not have the gifts now when we saw the operation of the gifts in your ministry we wanted to talk to you for you must know something about them now this brother's Seminary is out in the country and surrounded by many acres of Farmland on which the students can work and thereby pay their way through college if we live in this day in time the government's just going to take care of you he also has factories that go along with the farm to give added employment so using his field to illustrate my case I said once there was a man who went forth on his own ground to plant a field of corn he pulled up the stumps cleared off the rocks in other words prepared ground plowed and disc it and then planted his corn each morning he looked out across the field but one morning instead of bearing ground he saw myriads of little blades coming up he said praise God for my Field of Corn I then asked the man I said now did the man have corn the man said to him well in one way he did I said potentially yes that was you lutherans in the Reformation putting forth your blad see the corn began to grow now listen the life that was in the corn was in those two shoots whether it was just didn't look like it at all cuz they still had doctrines and different things wasn't like the wheat that went in the ground or the of the Corn the kernel but that life had to push and then through that life came a stalk that come up and it went all the way to tassel but remember you and I are not tassel you and I are full same corn that went in the ground right now watch the corn began to grow after it had rotted in the ground during the Dark Ages right so let's read here real quick what is justification and then we'll take communion justification is what that's the outer Court remember brother R explained the court the three courts that are in the Tabernacle in the wilderness there was an outer Court you went behind a veil there was an inner Court you went behind another veil was a holy of holies all right what was the outer Court the outer Court was called actually the court of the Gentiles cuz anybody could come in Mill around do the things you need to do cuz it was outside but now you had to be a special person though to get into the next level you had to be Sanctified all right and then to get into the holy of holies only one person okay but remember that one person had to start out here walk through walk through into the holy of holies all right everybody with me now what happened in the second Veil there was a cover over it everybody with me just a minute that second veil was veiled no the outer Court anybody could see it I'll read it to you in just a minute anybody could see it walk in it it was free to come any way you wanted to that's justification you're just to be there you've been invited you've walked into the court but now to be Sanctified when you go behind that Veil only a certain member of priesthood can go into that Veil and it was artificial light but if it rained one day you didn't get wet if it thundered and lightning you didn't get wet you were covered you were Sanctified everybody with me but then outou of court if it rained you got wet if you had a bad day you had a bad day then the holy of holies was nothing but the Ark of the Covenant and that was it that's the holy of holies that's where you and God are there as person by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said now we need to boldly enter into that Veil but we got to go through the outer Court let's listen to what brother rown says real quick a hidden life in Christ that is a real good there's about three sermons he preaches on a hidden life in Christ you ought to read them all or listen to them now that's a sign or a type of the people look the regenerated man who comes to Christ now watch gives his life in but never became get away into the Holy Spirit he lives a life that he knows he's eating Mana remember everybody ate Mana in the wilderness all right and that was a type of the what the Holy Ghost but how many made it to the promised land two out of two million all right more people did but that generation didn't make it there's many people now listen to me real quick there's many people today that's never went any further than the outer Court yet they're Christians uh by the millions you see that by the millions they enjoy Christ in an outward form they go to church with a consolation of knowing they belong to church some people don't even have that Revelation but they have never become hid away with him in the inner courts h same same message another thing we'll call your attention just before we close look at the light on the outside in the courts that was the firmament that L it up now remember this is Luther's age all right got it justification look at the light on the outside of the Court it was the firmament that Lit it up sunlight and so forth some days was cloudy some days the sun didn't shine at all some days it was dark now that's in the outer Court everybody remember outter Court inner Court holy of holies the outter Court Martin Luther justification you were just to be there but now remember if you stayed out there you didn't get Sanctified if you stayed out here I mean we have bad days and good days but that's on the outward person that inward person inside of you should be absolutely I'm Overjoyed with being a Christian not just going through and making it barely getting by you got to go in that next Veil cuz that's getting you closer to God the outer Court the inner Court which will be John Wesley all right then the holy of holies will be Pentecost or receiving the baptism of the ho ghost all right we'll get into that a little bit later when we get back to the next one but in the outer Court that's what Luther was the outer Court you know he could drink a beer and smoke a pipe he could he could believe in a trinitarian Doctrine but God winked at that ignorance and he said that's my man for the day that's my man that I need in that court for the time you and I have to go if you're a Christian today you got to go through that Court you got to believe that you've left whatever you did you've left behind yes sir but remember if you stay in that Court you're going to get it again you got to go into the next court in there where you're what got some cover so now let's read just real quick Revelation 6 ver5 now when he had opened the Third third seal now we're into the fifth Church age everybody with me for a minute all right when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast which was what the man lion ox man we got one more to go the eagle come and see and I beheld in L Black Horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in in his hand and I heard the voice in the midst of the four beast and I want you to realize something this is not a beast talking all right hold on and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see everybody with me all right now beheld in L black horse this is John he that s on him had a pair of balances and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beasts not one of the four this was Jesus Christ himself telling you this journey is getting ready to be now a fulfilled age not an unfulfilled age I'm going to give you power that I've never give you power before CU what does he say do a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and look and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine my Holy Ghost is going to make you get you through see thou hurt not the oil and the wine this was Jesus himself if you'll read in the church ages or in the seal book brother Brown I'm tell you that's what who that was I that's not a revelation I got it's already in Seal book he said that was a different voice he said that was the voice of Jesus Christ or the voice of the Lord what saying hey I'm going to get you through this you're going to make it don't hurt my oil and wine to the third seal now the lamb got the book in his hand breaking the seal broke the first one second and now he breaks the third one and as he breaks it the lamb breaks it the third seal the third Beast now who was the third Beast that was the man how many knows what the third Beast look like look like a man first one look a line second one a calf or an ox the third one look like a man as a man and he heard the living creatures the Beast living creatures like a man say to John come and see what it is the mystery that's been HIIT all down through the years of look of redemption he's fixing to bring back the full picture of redemption how we come from a sinner to a saint he's going to show that to us in the seals all down through the years of redemption since the foundation of the world it's been hid under this seal what's going to happen now come look what it is and so he opens it up a thunder blast and the lamb opens a seal now John walked up to see what it would be what' he see he seen a black horse and his rider had a balance or scales in his hand now that's the first thing he saw when the lamb announced it broke the to seal the other Beast see them other beasts are taking turns about announcing turns about lion ox man Eagle Eagle not come yet but the man is announcing now and John where he's standing maybe like this he walks over when the lamb opens it walks over and usually the Thunder strikes as we seen in the first seal what the Thunder is a Ministry it's something that's never before been been spoken it's spoken now usually the Thunder strikes as we see in the first seal and we watch and he watched just to see what takes place he's seen a man coming first on a white horse watch him ride down and through John sees him Plumb to the end he sees him come down his White Horse got a bow the rider he has no arrows and the next thing he sees he gets a crown rides on through then we find out then the lamb here he comes and he opens another one now here comes a red horse all right we've already been through this and this man has a sword in his hand he rides right on down through the scriptures see with a sword and was to kill and take peace from the earth now the lamb opens another seal another one of the living creatures like a man said come and see now he walks up to see what this is and when he does there comes a rider on a black horse now last night we find out that the same Rider that rode the White Horse on the red one and he's going to be on the black one so it's the same devil right all right the voice in the midst of the beast called out you see to come see what it was he was in this living creature and he saw this black horse and when the voice in the midst of the four beast called out a measure of wheat for pinning a measure of or barley for a penny but see thou hurt not the oil and the wine this writer let's discuss him if you notice the first out a riter who he was the second riter we found out who he was he was same man what happened he changed his ministry same devil but what happens see when God changes he doesn't change his word but he develops more remember ankles knees thins he's moving you through to higher Revelation well guess what Satan's right there behind he changed his ministry we found out he was an antichrist and he changed his position we found out that when he first just was a white horse he became a Doctrine now we're taking everyone right back to the scriptures all right now those four seal now remember now in the first age was line that was a line of trib of Judah Christ his own influence of life was taken in that age that's the first piece which means power that answered by human voice oh had to come to a human being the next age was the ox or the dark horse riders age now the reason this first age was a white age I've always heard people say that the writer white was the power of the church that went forth to conquer we find out he was given a crown what it was now remember everybody's explaining it but brother brandom comes back and says uh that's not the church that's the demon that's the devil all right now the second age was a red horse which was a dark age age or dark times the Dark Ages all right now the black horse rider that was the Antichrist but the one that was speaking in that age was represented as a man and that's the wisdom smart and shrewdness of a man let's go back to the fourth seal I'm going to sum it all up right here and then we'll take communion now brother rown comes and he puts every this together this is in the fourth seal now notice the last part of verse eight while we're closing power was given unto them who is them all right Antichrist called death and Hell Followed watch his four point scheme then we'll back up again in this age of sardian church age the Antichrist White Horse kills by spirit being Antichrist spiritual kill right he spiritually started killing the people by the doctrine but he's going to physically kill them in the in the fourth Church age all right number two red horse kills by sword iCal power when church and state United just like I told you before black horse Souls when he gave out his Doctrine and she did there with her fornications he weighed out the food sold them listen that black horse started in the Dark Ages we know they lapped over everybody with me real quick all right but what happened you say well black horse should have been in the Dark Ages like I said before God didn't ask you your opinion that black horse is when they started calling theirself Baptist and thinking they were bride Lutheran not him Luther but Lutheran and they call theirself bride that's the darkness that's if the light in you be Darkness how great is that darkness that black horse was telling the people you're good just pay the no venas just do the right thing food what is food food is Ministry food is stored up food brother R said eat this food well Satan said e this food right what they give for food for balance and the pennies and so forth and then the fourth we'll read him in in the last Church age a Pale Horse Eternal separation from God when lust is conceived it brings forth sin When sin is finished it brings forth Eternal separation from God anytime listen but listen listen listen real quick anytime in between that you can say you can stop and say God forgive me I Repent I don't want to go any further on that anymore but when lust is conceived it brings forth sin when sin's finished it brings forth death Eternal separation from god let's stay in God God forgive me if I'm in the outer Court please lead me into the inner Court let's stand let's get ready to take commune that fifth Church age was so important God poured out all this information from the prophet that said this is one of the most important men because if there had not been a Reformation there would have never been a restoration had to start somewhere sometime everybody with me all right so God was pleased to dwell in that little two shoots listen that's the same life it come out of the Corn it just wasn't mature but it was a corn plant it had life in it but it wasn't to full maturity we've come to now to where it's not even the tassel the tassel looked somewhat like the corn of wheat but brother brand says it's a protector but when you take and do this right here go in the field of wheat it looks like wheat growing that's not the wheat the wheat's inside of it we put it together and do like that and you've got wheat the chaff goes away that's what God done through First Church age he took it all the way through and he and they died in the Dark Ages but he said I will restore I'm going to bring it back not now what went in the ground the son of man went in the ground the revelation of the son Jesus was the son of man come on somebody somebody say Amen okay you fix it open your mouth and take communion you open your mouth and say Amen or owe me whichever one you want to do but that was Jesus Christ he got put in the ground that was the son of man right all right well he rose back up come on the day of Pentecost though as a spirit God the Son of God the flesh God is still somewhere up in another dimension is everybody with me this is the message so he walks through the church ages allows things like this to happen to prove that he's God and he's gracious he's got more grace than you and I got he's gracious to these people to let them not get by but for them to lit a piece of the word a piece of the word a piece of the word a piece of the word but remember whatever went in the ground if it got put in the ground it's got to come back up all right so it hit went in the ground in isah it in the ground in the Dark Ages all right that Revelation was gone but when you come back you got to go back to the corn what was it that was the son of man they put in the ground so it's got to be the son of man Revelation while we're here in the end time right back to the same he said I will restore or in other words I will repay you that's why this journey this journey is hard but look at the end results eternal life nothing on this Earth is eternal is that me and you nothing on the outside I was thinking yesterday you know how much trouble and trials we got and all the aches and pains and all the stuff the Bible says all things will be made new brother random even says one time he says all wrongs will be made right could you imagine walking through a day with no worries at all none not an ache not a pain there won't be no grunting in heaven when we get up we grunt oh we Danny we oh there won't be any of that think about you can't fathom that but that thing inside of you has already made it to that point that thing inside of you is already Eternal it doesn't GRT when it gets up it's 20 years old it doesn't even sleep now explain that to me I don't understand it but your your theophany your soul doesn't go to sleep to prove that is you have dreams and I don't know where all them goofy things I have come from but uh it comes from that subconscious somewhere but there's an inside down on the inside that may one night tell you at 2:00 in the morning pray for so and so wake you right up and sit you right up out of the bed and say pray for so and so so listen that ain't the devil the devil will never wake you up and ask you to pray for somebody I'll promise you that I you can be a sure that's not going to happen so if something happens in your life and you have to get up and something says pray for brother kerna you you better start praying pray for him cuz like I said the devil the devil will keep you back he'll put you in a he'll put you in a coma he keep you from getting up to pray God hates it when we pray I mean Satan hates it when we pray God loves it when we pray amen let's take communion let's excuse me let's read our scripture they get pulled up for me or I can get it about lost my voice 1 Corinthians 11 we come to a time that I know I talked to a man not long ago and and he said oh I don't take communion anymore he said he said the Lord's already come I said okay I said well he said he drink it with us in in his father's Kingdom and I thought this was the father's Kingdom and he said on the he said before that he said I'm not going to drink of this until I get to that place well is he walking around here today is he literally drinking no he's not here the brother said oh I said a death ordinance I said so is salvation so is water baptism so is this and so is that this whole thing's got to do with death but from death comes life and we do these ordinances because God I I told him I said brother if you can tell me where they got took out I can tell you where they got put in right there in Corinthians but tell me where God took them out that we're not supposed to do it we're supposed to come to this great you know he thought we were this great level up here that we didn't need it I need a cleansing those listen the the apostles it says in here sometimes they took communion daily they believed in it they believed in communion and they were there and they heard what he said they knew they needed it so do we for I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do you in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood we've been through that before the New Testament death of the testator he was getting ready to die and there was a New Covenant coming there was a new testament coming this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes well amen amen man I wanted somebody to die for me I needed somebody to die for me but not just a regular man brother John I need somebody to die that had eternal life that can come back inside of me and make me eternal wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord listen it's just people get lazy in the end time they think they're so high revelated they don't even have to come to church they don't have to have this I don't know where anywhere where God told us to when we become Christians to quit doing stuff that he told us to do amen he even told us I told the brother I said what about foot washing he said you don't have no part with me if you don't wash feet oh that's all just that's that's all uh you know they it's like the Bible says they counted of none effect they don't think it they need it I need it wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself we're going to stop a moment and we're we're going to take a moment of Silent prayer you examine yourself and you know what there's a there's a guy inside of you beside of you easy that that's going to say you're not worthy you you said something to your neighbor you wasn't supposed to you you talked about the preacher you that's the devil but if it is God say God forgive me I'm sorry for what I did I'll make it all right right and forget about the devil cuz he's going to keep coming at you it's like somebody told us one time said um if you have to wait till you can afford to have kids you'll never have kids right if you say I'm going to wait till this point well same way with taking communion if you're going to wait till you're good enough you'll never take it am but there is a way to get here to take it let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread he didn't say examine yourself and then no sorry can't do it he said and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body but for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world I see he separated us from that wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home in other words those Corinthians they were making a feast out of it they were getting drunk at the table saying this is the Lord's supper and we're eating you know beans and potatoes and corn and mutton and and lamb and all this stuff and we just getting drunk that's what they that was their interpretation of what Paul said well Paul had to come back and said no that's not it if you want to eat somewhere go eat at home this is not eating this is communing this is fellowshipping with God and if any man hungry let him meet at home that you come not into condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come Paul said he'd do that this do in remembrance of me let's take a moment a silent prayer get slate clean say God from this day forward I'm going to be better I'm going to do better I'm going to think better I'm going to act better I'm going to take this communion and I'm going to I'm going to say in My Heart Lord this is you that's going to have to help me do this and this symbol is a symbol that you told us to do brother Brown said he said what he said God loves you to do what quote the word to him so quote the word to him let's clean up act right act better and let's take communion thank you Lord bless this time that we're fixing to take you told us to do it Lord we're going to do it till you come in your physical form and then we'll do it at the wedding supper Lord and we'll continue on for as long as you want it to be father in Jesus name amen God said he took the bread and blessed it dear heavenly father Lord this bread has been made with holy hand it's not been held over it'll be burnt tonight Lord but we'll partake of it Lord and it'll become Lord part of us in just a few minutes Lord but Lord may we be more like you when this happens father that this is not turning your literal flesh as the Catholic Church didn't put the ACT Bible or that this is they turn it into the the literal body no this is a symbol and Lord the symbolics of it is that we'll take it and burn it won't hold it over Lord it'll be new revelation every day father just bless it in Jesus name amen about throw my voice out sorry you know man's got so convenient now I think on Amazon you can you can buy a cup of of grape juice with a little wafer sitting on top of it it's all kind of it's for those of you that press play um you can uh you can take communion if you want

well that must mean a literal person going supposed to be here I'll drink it with you in my father's Kingdom well praise God absolutely will but until he we got to do this until he comes in that form we need to do this as a commemoration do this and remember it to me you remember with this and he gave you the holy ghost or if he didn't please ask him for it and he'll give it to you all right we'll get ready for the uh for the foot washing you pull those scripture up for me our supper being ended the devil have now put in the heart of Judas this carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he was come from God and he went to God he rises from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel for with he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord does thou wash my feet question mark he's asking him Jesus said what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered and said if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said Lord not only my feet but also my my hands and my head Jesus said unto him he that is washed and Heth not saved wash his feet but is clean everywh and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all clean so after he' washed the feet so after he had washed their feet and had taken His Garment and was sat down again he said unto them I've give you a lesson know you what I've done to you now there was a lot of time in Jesus's life he would say hey don't worship me worship God remember there was many times he said don't worship me worship God but right here he knew it was all coming down to culmination into one man that Jesus Christ almighty God that he and the father was one he knew where he come from knew where he was going to he knew his purpose you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am so he got a he was bringing a revelation to them if th if I then though look if I then your Lord and Master wash your feet bless God you y'all y'all going to wash mine and I ain't washing no he didn't say that you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you what a supreme example Jesus is our example for everything verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he he that is sent now watch greater than he that sent him if you know these things happen are you if you do them let's bow our heads dear Lord Jesus thank you for this service you give us thank you for the congregation that you've given Lord to listen to the words Lord that may have been poorly given but I pray Lord that somewhere inside of that there'll be a revelation of of as brother Ernie says an updated Revelation that comes to this time we're talking about Lutheran and different ones in the church ages but Lord that same demon is alive but the same Jesus Christ is alive and well and he's in a group of people called The Bride Satan's going to do all he can to stop us but he can't do it he doesn't have it in him he doesn't have the Holy Ghost he doesn't have the Redeemer the Healer he doesn't have eternal life but father we do and Lord I pray that we'll take that and carry it to a world that's dying father and that we'll witness to someone Lord maybe this week and and and and take ourself into the Bible and into the prophet's message a little bit deeper and and listen to you talk to us through that Prophet Lord the voice of God for the age Lord I pray that You' be with us us now as we go to foot washing Lord just be with ones that are sick bless the ones that couldn't be here father just give us Revelation Lord and be with us Lord as we come back on Wednesday Lord Brother Aaron to be
