========================================

open the eyes of my heart right amen shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy amen holy holy holy holy holy amen and amen and amen and amen i want to see him don't you good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you like turn in your scriptures turn back where we've been reading in romans 7 and we'll continue our thoughts now remember to the brothers and things you see this evening we're supposed to meet for a little bit kind of find out what everybody's got to bring and what to do and and all to going to the father's day uh time that we're having this thursday friday and saturday and we pray that the lord bless if you want to come up and eat with us we always have plenty of food and things and you know even if you don't want to fish come on up and we can sit around by the campfire i don't generally do a lot of fishing anyway so there's always somebody there to talk to and just come up and be with us and we'll be talking about that this evening but just remember now to you with the children and all make sure that you bring them drinks snacks and things of what you want them to to eat and to drink and all and of course you know they always get out there and get to running and going so we make sure we've got plenty of water and things like that and we supply the the like tea and stuff like that and orange juice and all but just drinks that you want to want them to drink and and all to make sure you send them with them and snacks and things to do and we always try to do everything we can in the correct order we try to obey all the laws and things uh you know if there's any of you that would be 16 you've got to have a hunting i mean a fishing license so make sure everybody understands that don't come up and think you can't get them up there they don't have them attached to a tree you have to kind of get them here you know so you know do that and make sure you do and you know when we try to obey all the laws and and things and clean up and and do everything and we we do that it's a good job of of doing everybody helps and works and and all like that but just remember those things uh we help the children try to catch theirs but we don't catch their limit you know that's that's not according to the law you're not supposed to help somebody else get their limits you're supposed to catch your limit and that's when i go if i get one fish i don't want nobody else catching me seven more to give to me because that's against the law so we need to to make sure that we follow all the laws and the things and and obey all of that you know because we're trying to set an example in front of the children to where they would do but we you know we get out there and we flip over for them and hand them to rod and you know and let the kids pull them in and and and i do that i have more fun doing that than than i do even trying to catch one myself because when you see them little ones there's an excitement going on so you know we do all of that but make sure now one thing make sure that you send some extra clothes because the kids always get wet and it may be cool you know so make sure you send some extra clothes shoes or something and a little jacket or something because it gets cool at night they're in the mountains i mean make sure you you do that and you know we have a campfire but it generally gets cool sitting around and talking and doing and all like that so just make sure you do those things uh anything else you might want to bring your little light jacket that's waterproof or something because it may be raining something and all of this thing just remember that we'll be talking about it this afternoon and and doing it all right any other announcements uh brother richard went by to see i talked to him this morning brother wilson he went by to see brother bill younce and said he was doing better and really coming along good he still swelled up and things but still doing and that they were able to you know cap off the trach and he could talk some but they didn't want him to do much you know because they didn't want no problems but you know they're they're getting in at least working into some things and just keep praying for him and the lord would bless him and bring him on out of these things and and all like that anything else i always forget something heavenly father we thank you for this day and your love unto us we thank you for calvary thank you for loving us and caring for us and lord knowing that you are god and you change not then we can depend upon you to keep your word and then that way we can just stand up on the word and we can believe the word and and honor it and keep it and try to walk in you we ask you to bless each one remember the sick among us because you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we know that there's many needs here spiritual needs physical needs financial needs maybe lord we pray that you would just bless each one bless the the internet people the system as they're listening and lord may they understand that we're just trying to continue on in you and to walk in the light of your love we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and guide us in jesus name amen he'll go with romans 7 no you're not brethren for i speak to them that know the law have the law have dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband now he sees illustrating what he's just said that the law as long as you and i are alive we're under the law you can claim all you want to but if you're still alive you're under the law the world's still under the law today you can't get people to see that especially you know a denominational people are denominational ideas he was oh no the law ended at calvary we're not under law we're under grace no let's don't make it disgrace unless you're born again you're still under the law if you're born again then you're dead this is the best way to say it so then paul's showing it but nay's illustrating it see he's not just picking on women he's illustrating what he's saying how does the law have dominion over a man as long as he liveth now the illustrated scene for the one which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband see why because we're talking about the bride of christ not just a natural thing we've been through those things so then if while her husband liveth she'd be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brother and you also are become dead to the law by what the body of christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit under god for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead were in we were hell that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now i know we are putting quite a bit of time into the thoughts and things of what we're doing and you know i want to do that but you know sometimes when company comes in and different things happens you just have to kind of do the best you can and move on you know in the lord and that way it gives everybody a chance to understand but now we've been talking about we went through the marriage and divorce message going through and covering the different things and and all that the prophet had to say on it then we started into the message called the invisible union all right in that message then the prophet covers these things of how that we must die and all this and the other and but the thing that i'm wanting you to do is just keep reading that book until you begin to realize that you're looking at a man that is uh time running out because that was what he was saying you know he leaves out west he's heading back to jeffersonville and as he's coming back you know he's killed on the earth struck on the road guys the hospital later but yet he's running out of time and he's trying to pack in all he can so he goes and speaks there at the church and you know puts out a lot of things but what i'm wanting you to see is that there's a threefold revelation or he covers three things in the invisible union first the new birth all right secondly the marriage in divorce to the point that he could cover out there as being respectable to them you know and in their doings and then he covers law and grace all right so that's why we've been using it as a three-fold uh revelation and we've taken two messages already on the first fold and should take about 30 but trying to cut down to get you to understand because if you read that message you'll see the answer to a lot of questions if you'll just read the invisible union over and over and over you'll see a lot of answers that the prophet placed within there and how he was showing or illustrating you know and he said i'm not talking about you women he said whatever you are between you and god that's you he said i'm talking about christ in the church all right so when he's saying as i said when he covers romans 7 1 he shows that that as long as a man is alive he's under the law and that's what i said that's hard to get people to even consider or think about because we've been taught all of our life that the law ended at calvary you know well it did to those that are born again to those who get born again the law ended there because that's where he paid the price it was done but if it's not revealed to us we're still under law and when we get to it i'm just hitting these a little at the time to get you to thinking see you know we don't think about organized religion the way we should and i'm not against anybody i don't have any problems but just we will get to it more and more but see we we thought and man was doing the best he could in the day that he was doing it yet we come out of it with so little of a understanding until the prophet said well maybe we got it in here today he said they disassociated us from the word of god and you said no they was trying he knew that was talking to people right there that was trying but yet he was telling the truth see when we sang that little song god in three persons blessed trinity we don't realize all of our life that's been sung and you know how doctrines start most of the times they start with pictures because a picture captivates your mind it burns an imprint into your brain and in there they put the there's what is it called the madonna you know and they first started out by putting a little light over jesus then the next thing you know there's a little more that light begin to flicker over in pictures until they come over mary and we don't think that means anything but that's burnt into your brain he said but they didn't mean to do it now that was the devil doing that and we'll get down to more of that but what i want you to see is is one point that i've tried to make in the two services see we we jump up into marriage and divorce everybody wants to know about marriage and divorce they want to get set free you know they want to know what this is and what that is and what about marriage and divorce but if you're not born again what good is it that's right when brother branham said this is for the tabernacle only was he meaning that was just for the tabernacle sitting there in jeffersonville or was it as he said those who follow this message all right now you can only be a follower of the message if you're born again outside of that you're following rules and regulations and that's where the trouble is at see you're trying to perfect yourself doing this or not doing that and that's commendable great make a good neighbor but that don't mean you're saved see that's what we've been taught all over life though be good go to church you're going to heaven and that's what's killing us i want you know what i'm my mind you know where it's going so i gotta back up pull off of that get on back where we're at all right but you see if we don't see the new birth right if we don't have the new birth this message totally this bible and all the message is only rules and regulations or words on a page oh you're not saying that about prophet's message well you don't mind me saying about the bible but you just don't want me saying about the prophet see there's their denomination that's killed you first with that idea you're dead what you see it's rules and regulations that's the law paul wasn't under the letter of ten commandments he's talking about we've been over that a little bit we'll get over it more but to think about it unless we're born again see we can't even call him lord we have no right to speak to him whatsoever other than a repentance if we're lost and see then that way you say something and people think you're talking about somebody no i'm talking about me and you okay anybody out there on the internet system if you're listening what brother dale preaches here is to this church all right i refuse to answer your questions refuse to have anything to do with any internet system other than letting it out to the public if you want to listen that's up to you i see you go off and say brother dale said so and so make sure you say what i say because if not the blood's on you that's your business all right you want to listen and use it and help well amen but my wife used to say he said these preachers they don't understand said if they just listen to one sermon that brother dale preacher said they could get 40 messages off of it because he puts that many points into each one and they just listen and save them a lot of trouble because i give them the quotes you know but see they're not going to do it because that's just the way people are and they're doing you've got to listen to brother dale no no but you've got to listen to jesus christ now wherever he's at that's where you listen and that's where you give honor to that part and all like that because it's not what i say it's what the bible says you can take the prophet's message you can take the bible make it say what you want to but that's not what god said even though you've read it to the letter but it's got to be revealed amen the more and more as you see the hour approaching all right but see we think that the first thing we need is we we need to get this grace imagine divorce no you need to get born again because it's not to you do you understand going to make it any plainer that's right the ones who follow this message is supposed to be born again believers right not just a world following the message see we're not born again we're we're lost all right what does it matter what your body's done right right and the mess up you're in physically if your soul is not saved what does it matter well brother dale i i'm born again i proved it because i come in the message well the devil believes it too he come in the message now you got him in on it see that's where god allows things to happen to people brother around and said where they can be a sore thumb i guess because it's ordained deacon at 23 years of age studying the bible praying and seeking god come in this message and found out i wasn't born again everybody else comes into the message and the way they're doing it they find out they was born again i found out it wasn't well you know by doing that i could do something about it i started seeking god i know i was born again because i come in the mess all right that's that's your life that's you that's not me but i hate to be like that lady was that sealed her doom you know and then when she come up to the time she was dying she went on teaching sunday school doing these things you know when it come up to the time of her dying she's screaming out i'm lost that's right she blamed that preacher for blinding her well there's one thing about it you can't blame me for it you can't blame me for telling you you're okay because i don't have any okays for anybody i've got a bible and a prophet's message if it sets you free you're free but if you can't believe it it ain't for you well i believe part of what it that's remember i covered him actually don't i believe part of what he said well i'm sorry that's saying you believe part of the bible but you understand the point i'm trying to drive see what we need is the new birth what we need is to be born again and then we can comprehend or understand what the prophet is saying because until then you can't no man can call jesus the christ or the lord as the scripture said without it being the holy ghost that's first corinthians 12 3. see you're saying what somebody else says and what good is what somebody else said now you misunderstand that point all right but what good is what somebody else says right amen well i brush bless god the bible is what god said right but if it's not revealed to you and i i believe that right it can be questioned do you want the quotes from the prophet he said as long as it's laying in this book it can be questioned he said but when it comes out of the book in other words into your heart is a revelation it can never be questioned again that's right but you see church we want the grace of marriage and divorce because of bodily issues but if we're not born again what good does that do that's right remember marriage and divorce is not for the world that'll show you just what i saw for two services are taught you know we must be born again don't understand because if it's if it could be understood by everybody why would it prophet say it's not for everybody only for those who follow this message all right and see in doing that then we come down to the basis of looking at it and seeing that there's three stages in the journey you've got the new birth the marriage and divorce situation and then you've got the law and grace we can't you say well i ain't under the law see that's where you're jumping over here trying to understand what you see church in our journey we're going to see i keep putting this in because i want you to think about it each one of these stages of that journey new birth marriage and divorce law and grace it means a death to you and i because as long as we stay alive god cannot do nothing what do you think we've been here 40 something years after the prophet went off the scene come on well what we're doing waiting on the rest of the world out there now you sure got a bad mental problem come on because if it was waiting for the world to catch up god could send them all here tomorrow and we'd all be gone right but you see that's what we think if everybody can get to where i am we'd be ready to go you ain't never heard me say that way we see the invisible union shows us the the opportunity and explains to us our journey through life it's a wonderful message and it's showing us how that we must be born again then we can talk about marriage and divorce then we can even just at that time that we begin to understand that we can start comprehending the law and grace and what it means but remember each one is a death to the old husband well now let me put this in this way we say well brother dale how how is it that we could die to ourselves because that's what we're talking about you know we're not talking about blowing somebody's brains out and killing them well why can't we remember or think about that by the natural birth that we were and that's what we want to get to this morning more of you know what we were born dead why is it such a problem of dying well i don't want to die why is such a problem of understanding death when we're born dead but oh no no i've borne the seed in me i've got this seed in me i'd burn that seed in me and that seed all it needed was just to kill that old devil out of the way and i just come forth that's denominationalism that's catholicism to the core and yet we call them good brothers you know right but you see church the reason we've been around here all this time is because you and i hadn't got down to seriously about what's going on amen and hey we're all getting old you know i'm looking at wrinkles and hair missing and all kind of things you know you think we got another 50 years i wouldn't want to be one of these kids and think about living 50 more years not in this world right but you see church jesus said you must be born again that's right and as i tried to bring out back there the greatest religious leader that acclaimed him to be sin of god and that nobody could do the things that he done unless god be with him the teacher it says in the original from of nicodemus and yet he couldn't understand but yet we're so quick to say all you gotta do is believe now you think nicodemus wasn't a believer you see we don't think about that we just think about where we are and what we are and got our little petty ideas about ourselves and it don't matter what anybody else says because that's what the bible says that people come to the place during the old testament scripture that everybody done what they thought was right in their own eyes and i'm looking at it and i hope you're looking back at me see as long as we keep on with what we think in our minds and our doings we're going to keep on dying it says what i said we want to try to make marriage and divorce some great height you know the the if you're not born again you can't even start the journey then once we get this settled about marriage and divorce and our natural acts we still got to deal with law and grace well all i want to know is grace let's just tell me just tell me how great i am i can't tell most of you how great you are because you won't even come around to listen i've always done it i'm put this in i'll put it in again i'll put it in again if i stay around another 10 years every time i get down to the bases that i got something i want the people to see they start laying out missing services well you don't understand my case i understand your case that's the problem but i understand the bible but at least now we do have the internet where you can sit this afternoon and listen and criticize without having to look at me right you know it's kind of hard to look people in the eye when they're looking back at you yeah what are you looking at me like that for but listen church you say but i've got it already i know what it is do you i made a statement there the other week and i remember wondering how many remembered it i done it deliberately i only told my wife about it i made a statement and i left no loopholes for anybody with a marital situation then of course you get all upset at me because i bring it up but you get upset at me because of a marital situation you've done now that's first off that's carnal that's right that's no problem that's just carnal you blaming me for what you don't know i'm blaming you for bringing it up but one brother when he left that was what he said he said you just keep bringing things up well all i was doing then was announcing fellowship meetings you know every other week to you know what i was doing but it's all right but i made a statement in there that this afternoon i'm going to get down and really talk about it but when you take what brother branham says without a revelation on marriage in divorce then he comes in the indian comes to the invisible union and he said she can be forgiven it can't be justified remember that statement right now what are you going to do with that and remember she is the bride well according to that the bride can only be forgiven how many of you caught what i said or was even listening you realize how horrible that i could make this thing until none of us have a hoax whatsoever what good thing do you think made you with a hope right what good thing did we do that would make god love us sometimes i wonder even if brother branham understood what he was saying until later when it would unfold and he'd look back and it's oh god look what happened there i believe it unfolded to him don't you sure but we'll get back to that the lord willing this afternoon if we can get this out of the way but see jesus said you must be born again why why is it you must be born again evidently we was born wrong to start with right i mean that's sensible right from that terminologies and doings if jesus was to tell nicodemus you must be born again that meant nicodemus was born wrong now it didn't mean he was physically born wrong because his lineage was perfect or he wouldn't be the guy sitting where he was not only was it the high priest that could be killed but you see those guys sitting in the rims of where nicodemus was at they didn't have no marks paul come up our saying a pharisee of the pharisees a hebrew of the hebrews considering the law of blindness he said but he said i found myself lost what a thing that a man like that would say and yet we think that all it takes is let's just believe in brother dale all it does you just tell us how good we are i'm going to brother so-and-so he tells me well go to brother and so go on but you see the word is supposed to set us all free we don't believe the word then where we're going but now listen let's just read in this let the prophet i'm going to try to read pretty fast and then get back in and and pick up a thought may say a few things along the way but let's just think about what he had to say about you and i go ahead number one brother these will all be from the invisible union i think maybe one that lies but this is paragraph 206 and 207. life is a sacred thing to god it's recorded in a book god is the author of life do you believe that our natural life here we have is just a perversion now what good see that's that's why i can't stay off of those messages that way further because if you believe that you came here with eternal life as it's taught in the message by a lot of preachers then you don't need calvary well brother i've never heard no brothers today you're not listening are you listening now i hope to heaven you're listening better now than you was out there you didn't hear them preachers talk about i always was eternal i got this gene in me well see then jesus didn't need to die for us we should have understood that in the baptist church or wherever you come from before you come in this message i did i knew i must be saved i knew i was lost what about you he said our natural life is just a perversion it really should be the right life to begin with but it's perverted by what the natural birth the first life of your first union you were joined in at birth by nature a natural act a natural human being associated man and woman together associated together in sexual affair which brought you first your first life here and that's associated with sin and death how can you miss seeing the serpent seed now that's that's a good thought but remember where he's preaching in that like i said he's running out of time he's having to start preaching maybe he doesn't know that he's going to die on the road coming back but god is telling him pack it in he was doing every chance he could get look at the next one this is paragraph 2 12-13 now what is it what is our natural doing it was nature associated with death so there's nothing alive in the world everything's dead well i see people walking brother they'll they're not dead they're dead in sin and trespasses be better to be physically dead but what was it your first husband well i ain't never been married before he got by one husband that's why paul said he got to be dead to be married to christ well was it your first husband that had rule over you was your nature by natural birth natural you love the world because you are the world and part of the world is that needed explaining that right your desires was by nature to love the world which you are a part of you're a part of nature you believe that and that's your natural thing that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate you have to die to that first husband go and wrote it on that below you can't live with it you can't say well i'll divorce him and hang him up here till occasion you know what that means in the natural you know you divorce somebody but then you go back and run around with them every once in a while you associate with them you know you do that yeah well you don't think word associate according to how far you go right according how far you go you can't live with it you just say well i'll divorce him hang him up here until occasion no sir no writing or divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die every speculation has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature all right so you got to be born again right going to number three paragraph 221 222 is really the paragraph you read everything before and after and see if it doesn't match well you're separated from your first union by spiritual death now that's what we should have happened the new birth should have mean that her old husband is dead our adamic nature is that is that enough to understand we were born we'll get to it to see that ken folks to the devil in the book of ruth right then we had one closer kin if we want to type you and i were born in sin secondly iniquity spouse my mother's woman went forth a liar the prophet said on the hebrew series i'd hate to thank that a baby and born five minutes ago and i had to depend on something to go to heaven right you were separated from your first union by spiritual death so if we're not dead he's still alive now you know what he's meaning back over there where you don't divorce him you know to the in the spiritual i mean in the extent of our birth but see we well i'm born again it's okay for me to drink it's okay to my brother colleen was talking about that coffee or something they put that additives into it you know well it's okay we just take a little wine for the stomach's sake are you a woman if you're not you're gonna forget that it don't say for me to take a little whine for the stomach to say right now you're born again are remarried again look at the wordings brother brown and we use explaining the new birth and what are we we're dead to ourselves and remarried to the new spiritual union of not your natural life for the things of the world but of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you right god's predestination caught up with you right but what about this spiritual death now what is it to die spiritually it means that that you're too totally disassociated or life is disassociated from if you die right if you die you know you don't know what's going on here the bible even said the dead know nothing now but to be spiritual spiritual death means that we need to die to ourselves before we're born again you know that's the reason most people are not born again because they've been taught this taught that taught there's some rule of regulation and if you don't want to go over here you go over there you don't go here you go there you want to go here you go there you're going to find your church somewhere that'll accept your thoughts or you can accept their thoughts right now even in the message you can find it you know where it used to be pure and holy when we back there in the late 60s people was concerned about their lives and concerned about getting people saved then doctrine started coming out of finding out was already saved but you see if you think you're already saved you're dead that's as dead as any dead could be there's no hopes for anyone in that situation are you throwing off no i'm not i'm telling the truth what are you i'm talking to you if you think that then you're dead any blooder you're lost that's why i don't preach on hiring dressing clothes like all the other preachers because they think that's going to drive the women or this and mainly they want to drive the women you know they don't say much about the men the worst rules and regulations ever saved anybody if it is you didn't need jesus christ you mean a man like paul there's nothing they could put a mark on him yet he said i found what i thought was life to be death you know he had to doubt himself what about a man that spent all of his life and they don't nobody knows how old he was but see if he's 30 years old what are we curing i'd figure he's probably older than that because of his rank but what does it matter if he's 30 years old in 30 years he studied the law and found out the law was what was killing him he was studying the word of god and found out the word of god was telling him he's dead amen spiritual death means to die to our ideas our thoughts right but you listen church do you understand what the prophet is talking about our natural life was associated in death spiritual dead that's what i said we don't have to worry about dying we're already dead we just need to realize we're dead and then try to get the deader together the deader we can get until christ can come forth remember you can say i accept jesus christ and see that's what we do and we must but if he don't accept us we don't have anything right is that true now if he don't accept it well why don't he accept us there must be something wrong the reason he doesn't accept us exactly right right well it's certainly not wrong in him that's right but see it's what we've been taught is what's killing us you somebody teach these kids here you don't need to be saved well then somebody come along and try to talk to him about getting i don't need to be saved my daddy told me i didn't need to be sad my mama told me the pastor at the church told me i don't need to be saved will you think they're ever going to get saved come on spiritual death means that we must die to ourselves and be remarried we just read to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life we need the new birth you know let's see that's where we get old baptist you ever talk to a baptist about the trinity if i deny the father ought to know the son so i've got to believe there's three because if i deny one i'll deny the other one i'm trying to get you tonight i'm trying to get you to see the truth about it but you see you now how is it because this is my thought so we'll stay here if i don't finish it i don't worry about it i'll get on it this evening some more spiritual death how is it possible to have a spiritual death how you know what would be the possibility of even beginning that thoughts or or ideas of of receiving eternal life i just believe and i got it well okay if you got it but what is the possibility of being spiritually dead it would have to mean that we must die to our own selves our own thinking our own ways and doings let's see that's what everybody wants to do i want you to quit this quit that and do this and do that now brother branham said let's see if i'm paraphrasing it so if you'll miss it a little he said when they said what must we do to be born again he said we tell them what to quit and what to do he said that was not the question that was asked well you don't want us to do what no i want us to die then we don't have to worry about quitting or doing but he said the question was asked what must we do to be born again we tell them to quit do stop this that or the other we give them a book of rules and regulations what's the difference in that and coming up chris kissing the cross oh no you don't like it that bad do you what's the difference coming up bound down and kissing somebody's toe brother dale don't you think i need to quit this no we had a piano player she's passed on to glory she played our piano for 16 i think 16 years but you know probably about five or six of those years she was still smoking you let her play piano and her smoking yeah i'll let you in the door you want to argue any problems but you see you ain't getting on my platform any kind of things like that that's all right honorable and commendable if you're walking the straight line right you walk in a straight line you can talk about somebody else walking crooked right but if you walk in crooked and that's what a lot of us doing that's why they rant and rave about what's on the platform you see spiritual death is there any hopes for any of us is there any opportunity for anybody in the world he said with the prophet of god he really had a good life amen but he was born in sin shaping an iniquity spouse from the mother's womb went forth a liar he said lost and doomed and on his way to hell he said and it had to be born again he said that's right but see we're always trying to bypass the right way of doing something my wife will tell you in a hurry that when i do anything i generally do it the hard way but you know what i get it done and when i get it done what's the difference in how i got there as long as i get it done but see church that's just the way i have to deal in salvation it may be the hardest way the way that i preach and think you wouldn't understand me sitting this morning thinking lord i'm going to go today and i'm going to be the sweetest preachers ever been and i'm going to just tell them about the grace of jesus christ but you see that ain't going to save us you've heard that all your life maybe perverted way of bringing it by organizations and things but you've heard grace preached all of your life right come on did you everybody had a form of grace every church has a form of grace what did it do for you did it set you free or did the revelation of jesus christ set you free now which one which one is it is it just grace that we see in this grace and grace and grace or is it a revelation of jesus christ see then if it's revelation of jesus christ what we need is a revelation and have a revelation we must have a new birth you see church that's what everybody wants they want somebody they want to see these kind of forms or whatever forgive me but they want to say well wade's got a problem let's go cast it off of him let's do it i'm not against that now you go and do what you want to with what i say i illustrate that's right though that don't shake that demon out of him number one you got to realize he's got one right right if you don't realize he's got one it ain't gonna do you no good to shake him all over the place and ain't nobody here believes in emotions anymore in this man you're looking at but you show me in the bible where that was that's all i want show me in the bible where jesus done anything other than speak the word or preach the word to him come on i'm open folks but i won't see it i want to see where brother branham done anything other than preaching the gospel yes he was very emotional i believe in emotions i believe in life anywhere there's life there's going to be emotions amen but not screaming and hollering at devils is not going to drive them out you want a devil driven out of you sit down and listen to the word of god right i don't think brother donnie minds me telling it he was still smoking a little bit we let him get up here and play the banjo do things you see we've got a little book of rules that we don't want nobody else to know about so we won't tell nobody about it but we sit in our own little selves but where's there any possibility of any human being of ever coming to salvation well brother daley's got to believe on the lord jesus christ that's scripture but you know we leave out those things that he that believeth and is baptized we leave out being born again we live out a lot of scriptures on the things right and we just try to make our own little padded pitted ways you know but where's the possibility for anybody ever being saved well according to the prophet and the bible then a revelation is the only thing that can set us free right not a head knowledge or a thought but but revelation amen he that the son is set free what it's free indeed so then if we were lost and undone and we were and doomed and everything else then no matter what we could do or not do would have nothing to do with it it wouldn't change it so our total dependence is upon what he done you agree our total dependence of anything salvation marriage and divorce law and grace rapture anything is based on one thing whether or not he's real that's it right and whether or not he kept his word are you talking about laws never why blood you don't even understand about grace because i'm waiting for it amen but you don't understand the law the law was spiritual right is that what paul said but see how could we ever think about being dead enough that's why that message we put in there on the the soul is very valuable i've read around and said if he can just get that soul that nature or spirit to agree with him he said it'll die amen the goodness of god calleth thee to repentance it's not whether or not we get down and pray and cry and scream and seek after god right is whether god's seeking after us because it's the goodness of god that leads you to repentance not not how much you fast and pray and whatever you do but you you sound like salvation is just not for everybody it's for everybody that will believe it you say brother dale if any halts on me in my marital situation if you don't believe it there is none so you can't blame god because if you don't believe you can't be saved don't blame god see then the whole key is whether or not god is real whether or not he keep his word we know if he's real and he's god he's bound to have to keep his word right see and he said you must be born again then that's not a thought or an idea or concept that's the truth and to do that we've got to die our old husband has got to be dead like brother hanson said that time's a good point i hope you don't mind me quoting him he said it enough he said it's not all the wives that i'd have to be my problems how many husbands i've had you see church our first husband we just read that had rule over us was our natural nature that was our husband and to be reunited with jesus christ we must take another nature right amen and to take that nature is not putting that nature in you in your nature that's right it's going to be death to ourselves amen you see a lot of people are not honest in not knowing rules and regulations or whatever of churches and what they do they don't pay no attention i've told you many times about it when i was in the baptist church and a deacon well up looked up to 23 years of age so you know that was but you know the day i got baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ they didn't run me out of the church i knew i was contrary to the doctrine because anybody in the baptist church is baptized any other way than the father son holy ghost and you go join another church somewhere else don't make no difference once you go join and what you do you go join another church that baptized father son and holy ghost you go from a baptist to a methodist and you join that church and you get baptized again you come back to that baptist church you're going to get baptized again or you're not going to be a member of the baptist church see that's how much they believe in you well see i knew the day that i was baptized i knew that was the end of my time in the baptist church and it wasn't going to be that they were going to run me out i think a lot of times about like moses and i know you say well not compare yourself i'm not i'm just talking moses could have caused an insurrection down in egypt and took over he was the head of the army he could have called a coup and probably done a good job but that wasn't the way god wanted it see my family was over well over a third of that church my brother-in-law's family that was married into the family his family was over probably almost 50 percent of that church see i could have pulled some ranks and but i knew that wouldn't work so i walked out the door it wasn't the point of whether or not i was anything i knew i was contrary to the doctrine and to be contrary to the doctrine then i could not be there and stay there see every church teaches basically what i'm fixing to say that jesus christ come and died for our sins right but the problem is is when they teach you that jesus christ came and they don't teach you that that was almighty god so almighty god had to come down because that's what your prophet has to say what the bible says that god came but around says god saw us in that shape and said he knew something had to be done he said he came himself he didn't send a son another person or whatever said he came himself that's why the scripture said he that cometh to god must believe that he is and the rewarder of them that diligently seek him you're not believing he was or he's a thought or he's an idea or a concept or another person or whatever you got to believe that he is you never be saved without believing on the lord jesus christ he said well all him people wouldn't say brother if god accepted you back there under denominationalisms and trinities and things and gave you the new birth i'm not going to argue with you because that's between you and god right right but i'm just going to tell you it don't happen that way in every case all right see then i'd rather go through life how many statements are made of this i'd rather go through life seeking god find out one day i had him did he get there and find out i didn't have him because somebody told me something but you see it's up to god to make a way it's up to god to make a way that you and i could be saved but the one thing he can't do are you listening god cannot override your free moral agency he cannot make you be saved if you don't want to be he can't make you come to him and believe if you don't want to so we have something to do with believing don't we see that only lies for a certain part because that's the point let's make it a moment ago the prophet said it like this he said you've accepted jesus christ who said but has he accepted you you know over in the book of acts they were praying for him to receive the holy ghost right right in the book of acts who was it john and somebody which one or the other peter and john two in other words they were praying the people were praying for them to get the holy ghost couldn't get it on they called up and got elders they got us either john or peter or one of the two someone to come down and they came down and laid hands on them they received the holy ghost what was wrong good believers was there any difference in the two people was there any difference in the holy ghost in this man and the holy ghost in that man come on what was the difference why didn't the holy ghost come on them well it was in the secret way of those hands they had to have the special hands i believe whenever who got there said a few words and they did the holy ghost failed whether you believe that or not that's your business i don't care i'm just saying they've done something that it was not just some secret thing don't say it was cause it was in the body with this man that was down here trying to get them to get the holy ghost was in the body i know what your prophet says he said the seed was in the body i agree but the seed was in that other man is trying to get the holy ghost come on we're not talking about in the book of acts we're apollos and trying to i'm not talking about that get over in the bible and read it i'm talking about where they were trying to pray for them to get the holy ghost and couldn't get it for two years i sought god but a man one day made a statement he said brother dale i don't know what you're doing what you want him i said i don't either because ain't nothing i want except god he said i don't believe you're seeking some sign or some thing to happen i said no sir i just want to know he said will you remember one thing he said everybody thinks the holy ghost is this or holy ghost is that anointings and all that he said all of that you know about i said yes sir but he said you remember one thing god is a person amen he said in the new birth it's a birth of that person in you that was all it took that solved my problems because of what somebody said right see faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word brother dale we're not all you i agree with you i'm glad of that be a horrible world that everybody was to me but you see i'm just one person to do one thing i wanted god i wanted an answer and i wanted an assurance i wanted something i could stand on when the world would stand in my face i told you about the baptist preacher of me talking to him about water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and he said and i had told him that i wasn't born again he said who do you think you are trying to teach me he said i claim to be born again and said you admit you're not born again and said you're trying to teach me you're right but a few weeks later i run into the man there at work and i said your statements are no longer worth anything because now i have the experience right i didn't have no different words i had an experience luther taught the just shall live by faith claim salvation claim to believe in jesus christ preached him but one day the christ of the word came alive in his heart that's it has it done it to you and to do that you got to die amen yes but brother dale if i admit it i was lost look where i'd be in good shape if i deny the father i deny the son see you're trinitarian don't realize it you see i'm just straight and plain enough to want to know like i told the brother all of the reading i'd done and all of the tapes i listened to and i said i wasn't born again he said brother there's something wrong with you said you're reading the book today it's proved you was born again i said didn't prove it to me spiritual death that means we've got to get rid of everything and we'll read some more this afternoon where brother brown said every speck of him has got to be dead every speck of him he's got to be dead now i want to know about marriage and divorce that's what i want to know about i want to get free free from what if you're not free in the baptism of the holy ghost there is no marriage in divorce grace the new birth is first amen and foremost in our lives but the prophet said in the bla in birth plains it was hard to get them pharisees to realize they was lost where they'd seek god for salvation you see that's what's wrong with you and me sit and think that we're saved because we're in the message we believe the message we do what do you want me to do brother dale i want you to get bored again i want you to have an experience that nobody can take away from you no matter what anybody says you'll just stand there and look right at them and say thank you for being the way you are but i'm still staying where i stand you see i've told you about it i met god when i was 10 11 years old i seen him standing there but i never claimed that as a new birth i've seen an angel three times in my life i never claimed that to be a new birth but you can't argue with me about what i saw i'll take a lie detector's test anytime you want to about it but you see when i begin to hear that prophet talk about the birth of the word as that brother moak said god is alive he's real he's not just a thought he's a person but lord that's what i want see then you can't argue with me about that person because i've taught it down through here for 40 something years you can't argue about what i said about that god because i took it right out of the word to talk to you about him that i saw myself i can only tell you about my own life that's right martin luther couldn't talk about john wesley but neither did john wesley talk about martin luther sure he had him as a foundation but he said we got to go on now come on musicians and just end off cause i can't but you see church we want to talk about grace but if you're not born again you don't learn about grace you know words terminology's thoughts and what people say is understand you just know what somebody else has said about it but when you have an experience like old brother al said one time he said once you go up there and try to let brother dale try to talk you out of your healing or something you know but if i can talk you out of it ain't real right salvation is a person amen our old husband our old nature our old ways our old thoughts has got to die and that's the reason a lot of people are not born again because they're not going to do that they're not going to admit they're lost god can't help somebody that won't admit they're lost i've never been in the woods but one time and got lost and i wasn't afraid for myself that day is the reason i was there when you're lost you don't know which way you're going all your smartness all of your thoughts all of your river running this way your brain's running that away it won't work you'll start going around and around and the more you go around and around the deader you get just sat down that's what i done just backed up against the tree and sat down i said i'll just sit here little daylight comes but then after a while i got to thinking i couldn't do that somebody else was involved so i had to get out so i'd done the only sensible thing could be done where i was at i headed to the highest hill i could find and i hollered richard marlo found hollered back i made my way to him so you think you're not lost well my daddy is the pastor of this church i don't mean you're saved my husband no that don't mean you're saved it's whether or not you're born again go ahead just one one or two verses then we're going to eat together so we can take a little bit of time 124. anybody have a needle jesus keep me from all wrong oh i got a problem as i won't let me jesus you heard our brother age factor comes up and we start deteriorating that has nothing to do with you lord by your stripes her brother's healed we condemn this situation this problem we can believe you lord you can change a whole body to make your word be right in jesus name oh got a problem constipation it's given her a lot of troubles she said it when she actually tries to use the bathroom sometimes she'll start vomiting let's just believe you just put that on her bed okay lord jesus we love you father and you know how we love these little children and we can understand the pain the problems with the little ones lord could we just live lord the same one that paid the price for the big ones paid it for the little ones and by your stripes our little sister is healed and we believe you father we believe everything's gonna be all right we thank you for it satan in the name of jesus christ we challenge you not of us but the god that's within us upon you the word of god that says she's healed you keep telling us we're not but yet your word lord says we are and we believe you in jesus name anybody else let's see in the name of jesus christ we give these prayer claws our brother the place within his home to get rid of all of these allergies and things that are bothering sterling darth the doctor now lord we pray that you just bless him and take care of it just let your love be made manifest in jesus name anybody else the church we got to be born again if we're not born again we can't even start any journey whatsoever so your pride i take care of it i'd get rid of it but i'm not gonna admit i'm lost because if i did i'd be lost now show me that i want that in the scriptures and i want it in the prophet's message i know what he said about confessions i know he says we've got to confess it because we don't confess it god can't make it but where's an honest heart that he ever spoke of that was crying out to god and god would not hear that heart what is it it's because we won't get ourselves out of the way that just keeps burdening on me i'm sorry it just burdens on my heart to think about people that will not think about the fact that they could be lost they just everybody wants to think how saved they are and it's got to worthy and the kids don't even want to come to alder why because the parents don't want to come what about it ready cheers um for jesus you heard our sister lord she wants to know that she's saved but we could do a lot of things and ask a lot of points to do and she'd do anything we ask to be able to come to that place but there's just one thing that our sister needs to do and that's just yield herself to you lord and just believe it and just wait on you not to try to figure it out but just wait and let everything lord turn out to be the right we love you father we thank you we know that you're here to give us what our desires are lord we ask that in jesus name anybody else never stop seeking god you believe that prophet had god in his heart but he never stopped seeking god he was listening our life not i believe it was or not before he said lord i've done everything i can do to try to get them to believe what else can i do he said he laid before god until that gift would work in his life he said i've done everything i can do to get him to believe then he came out the next night and he said i believe america has turned down the gospel but that don't mean we have to turn it down because we're individuals told anybody else before we go none but amen and amen and amen and amen amen brother dean has a word you know sam i'd like to give a short testimony something happened to me tuesday thursday evening i had been talking to this brother for an hour and a half two hours about the mysteries of god brother in the message and uh i'm always very when i get through talking it breaks up i'm i'm always so desperate to god that i haven't said anything wrong you know and i i walked outside and uh and i was talking to almighty god and i said lord if i've said anything we're displeasing to you if i said anything wrong i was explaining the mysteries and i had my eyes closed if you all know the weather it was real cloudy and god is my witness i closed had my eyes closed and i felt this light bryce i've never seen my eyes was closed i've never seen anything this bright and it come down over my head i'm just talking what happened ain't got nothing i ain't got to do with nothing you know but god was concerned with me because i've been really studying the characteristics of god god's got a character and he's got characteristics and this is to be made of benefits in us exactly and it it just kept it just kept it enveloping me and uh i just it really kind of frightened me but i thought to start with when it started i said well the sun's come out you know it was late in the evening and uh when i opened my eyes it was just as cloudy as it ever was but i believe god showed me right then that what i was teaching was correct and he he was mindful this is just what if if we can grasp what has been preached to us and see it that it's the truth god always comes on the scene is us that don't recognize his characteristics god can be speaking through a man's lips and his deity speaking and like sarah said if how could this be see she doubted how can this be and that very thing is here today how could this be what the brother is saying how could it be you know how how could this happen see god said he would by the promise of god but brother sam that that actually happened whatever it means i don't know i've just taken it that god told me that that what i was what was happening i would i don't know what would have happened bro saying if i hadn't opened my eyes i i'm i'm just i've never seen and i've been in medals for for many many years but i've never seen nothing like this and i just i feel compelled to say it amen anybody else anything to say before we go we're going to eat together for nanny's birthday today she's reached her 71 she's got her whole year that she's enjoyed which is about what we promised so we're living on borrowed time and wonderful loving it and she's
