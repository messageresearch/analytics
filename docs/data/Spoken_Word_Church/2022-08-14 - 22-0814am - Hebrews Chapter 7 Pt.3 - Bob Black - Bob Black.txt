========================================

come expecting to receive we're on hebrews chapter 7 talking about looking at melchizedek let's just carry the lord in prayer lord we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word and we just ask your blessing as we as we study these things out and unpack the scripture lord jesus i pray god that you'll just open it to us lord in a way this goes beyond just teaching and laying things out lord that you'll speak to hearts lord and granted lord that you are just blessed by the way it is he's studying and preparing lord god and prepare our hearts lord to receive what you have in store for us today amen so hebrews chapter 7 says for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continuously continually now consider how great this man was and to whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils so as we study these things out that's what we want we want to understand is how greek this man was if we can get an understanding of who this man is will realize why while melchizedek paid ties to him and all of these things that paul is laying out well how is how could it be that levi would pay ties to to melchizedek while he was in abraham and and all of all of these things so we want to unpack this this scripture that abraham uh last time we were kind of looking at how that uh the journey of of abraham that he met melchizedek first in genesis chapter 14 when after the slaughter of the kings of cheddar armor and all the different kings that abraham went out to rescue lot and after after that battle was over then he sat down with melchizedek and and and melchizedek gave him communion you know it's always it's always after the after the battle's over when you when you have communion after you battle at battle things out and sanctification then god can begin to commune with you and and uh you can begin to understand that the word begins to open up to you so it says here brother brahman said and who is this melchizedek he said when abraham met him he was melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing so that journey that if we go back to that previous slide that the journey that abraham was on when he met melchizedek and then met him again later in genesis 18 that every every son of the faith is going to do that go through that same journey and every son of the faith is going to meet melchizedek how are you going to me what's the effect of meeting melchizedek you pay ties you recognize you recognize who you're meeting something begins to happen so so if we can understand how how great this man was and who this man is that will understand that our own story and the life that's unfolding here you know in genesis chapter 14 we looked at last time how how abraham uh communed with with melchizedek and you know communion is communion as a relationship and unfolding unfolding the revelation of who this man is and brother brahman said and who is this melchizedek when we start to look at who uh who exactly this this the nature of this of this person he said notice now his attribute the attribute was first god the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if you skip down to the bottom he said this then is the state he was in when he met abraham was called melchizedek so let's go back up to the top he said when when time began it was a word but before it was word it was attribute a thought now we're getting where melchizedek is that's this mysterious person his first being was spirit god supernatural all right the great eternal second he began to form himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body this then is the state he was in when he met abraham was called melchizedek he was in the form of theophany now we'll get to that and prove it in a few minutes the lord willing he was the word so now you've got this story you've got this picture of god unfolding himself so that we can understand him so that god can have fellowship with us unfolding himself in morphe revealing himself as he changes his mask down to where he's actually revealing himself in man so you take it and like john did all the way back to the beginning in the beginning was the word the expression the attribute of the fullness of god and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not so we've got that that picture i i did my best at trying to express something that really can only be picked it can only be understood by revelation but brother around like we explained last time that brother brown explained the the office of the father it's like a diamond or a a rainbow and a fountain all of those things that he tried to express that that within him were attributes and brother brown would explain what what's an attribute an attribute as a nature so in god was a nature of of redeemer or the nature of healer and when an attribute is expressed let's think that now if any of those attributes are expressed in you then you will have the same nature that that god wanted to express the same nature of god so it uh from god he wanted to express the nature that that attribute of a redeemer so he began to he began to to condescend to come down and express to express in something that we could understand that the word is called the word the logos now isn't it interesting that that expression of those attributes is called the word and we hear the word we're receiving the word you're actually as the as the gospel being preached that's what kind of the unfolding my point here as as we get to it as the word is being preached what's being preached is actually as you receive it you're actually receiving that thought that was in god before the foundation of the world you are becoming the word as you hear the word because you're receiving you're receiving that word that was in god before the foundation so brother ram said in the pillar of fire he said and now the bible teaches us that the logos went out of god or i might say all of the god becoming his first body form when the logos went out of god let's look at what it looked like no one has seen the father at any time no one nowhere never did and never will you're never going to see the father like like that like looking at it any time nowhere never did never will but then the logos that went out of him become like a little halo of light playing yonder like a little child before the doorstep of the father and now i can see him as he moves over here and he draws into his memory or his mind a picture of what the world should be now there's not a star or nothing i hear him say let there be and an atom broke beyond her and when it did the sun came into existence that began to whirl she burned for millions of years and millions and millions of years the first star that flew from the sun he watches it fall for a few million years and he stops it and then another one flies off and he lets it fall a few million years what's he doing writing his first bible the zodiac so you know i i got a picture if you if you haven't seen any of those pictures of the james webb telescope that just this they just this is one of those pictures that you can look way back into the eons and see see stars being formed and you know you think about that they start they didn't just come about just just happenstance but there was a god that spoke these things into existence so that's that that what i'm talking about is that that the logos the word the expression of the father is the one that came down and visited melchizedek he's the one that spoke these things into his existence and one day was manifested in the flesh of a little baby crying in a manger so that he could be manifest in your flesh brotherham said he said the logos this great fountain of spirit which had no beginning or no end this great spirit began to form in the creation and the logos that went out from it was the son of god it was the only visible form that the spirit had and it was a theophany which means a body and the body was like a man and it was the theophany of god that went out the human form that didn't have eyes like you see a better eye it didn't have ears like you hear but a far more hearing see it was a theophany that all this rainbow condescended into a theophany moses saw it when he passed through the rock like that he saw the back part said it looked like a man so what does a theophany look like it looks like a man with ten fingers and ten toes and a mouth that he could speak through and eyes but far better eyes far better seeing because it's a supernatural something supernatural not constrained by flesh so out of out of god no man has seen god at any time as john 1 1 says but the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him so god began to express himself by unfolding himself down john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god down down into genesis 1 26 that says god let us god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea now what's god doing he's he's got these attributes that he wants to express and so that he expresses himself in the attribute of the full the attribute of the fullness of the father was was the word and but yet in the word was all of these attributes the attributes of you and i that he wanted to express down through every church age he wanted to express some in ephesians at the ephesians age and smurling all down and so god knew each one that that would be manifest in every age so he had like uh it's like almost you say a scroll or or a book or as as brother keith reed was preaching uh last last weekend we'll say the abstract title d that you can go back if you can tie tie everything back to that original the original book the original abstract deed the thing that god wanted to express from the from the beginning then that makes everything right so brother ram said in in the believer's position in christ he said when god said man let when god made man said when god made man said let us make man in our own image let us give them plural let us get make man in our own image spirit man and give them dominion over the fishes of the sea and the cattles and so forth now back there before the foundation of the world god chose you and christ jesus to appear holy at the end time all the way from the foundation of the world and in hebrews chapter four he said was god a man certainly let us make man in our own image what was god a theophany a body and there man was made like that and put over the garden and god the theophany come down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem the man and questions and answers on hebrews number three he said when god created you in his image or created the man in his image and created the woman in the image of the man for the glory of the man he made you a theophany just like himself when he said let us to the creatures that he had made let us make man in our own image and our likeness of theophany what god is like unfurling himself unfolding himself is the words that brother ram used to explain that god's condescending moving moving down from from uh attribute from thought all the way down to where we could hold him and hug him and talk to him and fellowship with him which is what john chapter 17 is talking about when he says when jesus began to pray and he said as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou has sent i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou us me to do and now father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest me them me and they have kept thy word with god in morphing what's in morph and morphine is god changing his mask like like an actor in a play that he's got a mask going he's coming there's different acts in a play and he's and he's coming down to show to to to fulfill to play all the different parts now you look at this and you you we can see god coming down from thought attribute that great fountain to manifesting in a and a body at the logos the theophany when in those were attributes that he wanted to express so he expressed himself in flesh but now let's just let's just compare compare this now brother adam said we're not oneness and we're not trinitarian so somewhere in the middle of those you gotta have the right kind of truth so now let's just let's just kind of compare what does a oneness belief now now we believe that you know god unfolded from that attribute to logos to be manifested in flesh but now if you look at oneness theology they take take that picture that we just took and and and swipe away all of the the the logos part and the genesis 1 26 27 god unfurl unfolding himself into expression of of the the the attributes of you and i that would one day be manifest and and you're left with with this kind of picture i was looking at a a a website that was kind of outlining the one that's pentecostal viewpoint this is what they said you understand son to refer to both pre and post incarnation while we understand the term to only apply after the incarnation so the way they're looking at it is is is that god would take take the the look at the father is like the pillar of fire and you cannot use the word son until you get to jesus crying in a manger you understand son to refer to both pre and post incarnation while we understand the term to only apply after the incarnation coming into existence only because of the addition of humanity to god's previously unmitigated deity to describes the relationship between god transcendent between humanity and god limited in a human existence so what are the what are they missing they're missing the part of god unfolding himself which is what brother branham explained he said he said uh and the message lord show us the father and it suffices us he said they believed in the eternal sonship or there's three the the catholics the trinitarian viewpoint there's three actual individual being god the father an old man with a long white beard god the son a middle aged man and the holy ghost was a mascot boy light there's no such things there's only one god and i different agree with the organization of pentecost that calls the oneness like your finger is one that's wrong absolutely it's wrong jesus couldn't have been his own father and if god is a man then jesus was born sexual desire and not virgin birth that settles the whole thing so what are they struggling with you can't see the manifestation of god unfolding himself a loving father coming right down from the heavens unfolding himself coming down to live among human beings here on earth there you are god was in his son and now i've been unfolded to you also god is in his people so and you compare that with the trinitarian view and i'm i'm just trying to outline some of these things because i know some have asked to just kind of lead a basic framework for kind of what we believe and the trinitarian view is this picture is kind of what what the trinitarians all our websites and things show is that you know they've got the the diagram that shows the father is god and the son is god and the spirit is god but they're not they're not the same thing it's not the same but the father is not the son the father is not the spirit the father the spirit is not the son and it is looking at it not under failing to understand that it's one person all the time one personality you can see off the uh the website the catholic encyclopedia says the trinity is the term employed to signify the central doctrine of the christian religion the truth that in the unity of the godhead there are three persons the father the son and the holy spirit these three persons being truly distinct from one another but if you've got three persons then you got three per people arguing one another you got three opinions and you can never be you can never uh it would just be chaos if you got three different three different people and and then the scriptures are all all messed up how and what name would we be baptized in how do you how are you how would you be baptized in who do you pray to uh who are we talking to when we get on our knees which which one of these people so you see there's a there's a there's a a middle of the road to all things there's a balance between those two two two understandings between the oneness that that god is just is is just one like your finger and throwing away the unfolding of himself and on the other side that god is three different people so there's a balance right there in the middle if we can understand so brother adam said in the kinsmen redeemer he said i differ with billy graham on three individual persons in the godhead or any other trinitarian teacher on that i believe in a trinity of course now that shouldn't make us make our heads swim but not in that manner them being three persons not in that manner not like that that there's three different people they're one so there you've got the true understanding of matthew 28 19 it says go you therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost what's his name was answered in acts 2 38 his name is jesus christ because it's one person unfolding himself one per if it's because it's one person then the characteristics and the nature of the father manifested in the son manifested in you are all are all identical because the an attribute is the nature and his characteristics and his personality his personality manifested in brother branham and the life of irenaeus and martin and columba and all those and manifested in you will be exactly the same if you become the word if you become that word then it will be it will demonstrate exactly the same fruits exactly the same characteristics that was in christ brother brown said in the message of trial he said jesus come with three titles son of man son of david son of god all the same person that's just like the trinity father son holy ghost not three gods one person the three attributes of god now see just like i am three persons i am to my father a husband i'm to my daughter sitting here daddy and my grandson is sitting here at grandpa now my wife only has claims on me as her husband and my daughter here can't say husband because she's my child my grandson can't call me daddy he has no no claims on me as daddy he might call me that but it isn't so he is my grandson yet i'm the same person it's god unveiling himself bringing himself down so he can be he was above and a pillar of fire then he was manifested in his son jesus christ and now revealed to us by the holy ghost watch when he come now now don't forget though the question we're trying to answer is who how great was this man that came to abraham that this melchizedek how great who was this man it was god revealing himself and brother brown will say it and in morphy the difference between jesus and melchizedek was that jesus was the tabernacle that god dwelled in the flesh man and this man had no father no mother no beginning of days or ending of life but it was the self-same person it was melchizedek melchizedek and jesus and was one but jesus was the earthly body born and fashioned after sin what was that god and morphing himself coming down and brother bible said we find the word in morphe in greek which means the unseen was made visible he changed itself he come down and morphy means something that cannot be seen yet it's there and then it's changed and the eye can catch it that god is actually unfolding himself like i got a picture of a leaf unfolding himself and you know once it's finally unfolded you can see it it like unfurls to reveal itself and bill graham said in the testimony of jesus christ he said he's just unfolding himself from a sacred light above the people down into a holy body to redeem people then out into born-again believers the same god now that's the revelation of the godhead it's the same god all the time unfolding himself revealing himself god changed himself changed his changes his form brother said in the unveiling of god when the in morphe that means he changed himself he come down from something that could not be seen then it's changed and the eye can catch it like in brother and and who was this melchizedek he said when you got a sculpture you know somebody makes a sculpture they they they hide it with a mask over it when they they're slowly revealing it they take it they take the mask off and then they reveal what's underneath the the thing covering it and god promised in this day at the end of this laodicean church he would take the mask off the whole thing like what's happening with that little that leaf that's unfolding to reveal what was in god's thought before the foundation of the world god and morphe masked in the pillar of fire masked in a man called jesus in morphy in his church god above us god with us god in us the condescending of god so he said again and we would see jesus he said in the beginning god was a spirit and all the fountain of goodness and mercy and power and all the good things of love god was the center of that fountain and then the logos that went out of god in the beginning become what we call a theophany or supernatural body god is just not like the heir but he's in a body and in hebrews chapter four he said in the beginning was the same he was that great spirit found where all the trueness all the love all the peace everything that was pure was in this fountain it began to form a body a theophany the kind of body that we go to so we start talking about a theophany a body a word body a word body is actually what christ is sowing that's why the son of man is the only sower of the word is because the word the word is god is unfolding himself and as he's as he's so in the word you're becoming you you see you bypass that theophany you come here without that theophany but but the word is actually what's what's bringing you back to that but the board says in ephesians 2 12 at that time you were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise when you come into the world you are without christ but now in christ jesus you you who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ connected back to the word that the word is is made manifest in your members now the musicians can go ahead and come forward we're going to stop here and continue on that on that note on the next time and talk about how you what a theophany is and that there's one body one body that see in galatians 3 16 it says now to abraham and his seed where the promise is made he saith not into seeds as a meanie but as of one unto thy seed to thy seed which is christ and there you get into what that predestinated seed is the seed is christ the seed is always christ the seed the seed that you hear the the word that we're hearing is christ and we'll just stop right there god bless you [Applause]
