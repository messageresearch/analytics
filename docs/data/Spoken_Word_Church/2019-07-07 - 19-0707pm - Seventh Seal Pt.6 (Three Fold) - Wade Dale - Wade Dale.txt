got to was privileged to be at a hunting camp we're just guys there weren't any guys there but she saw how guys lived when there's no girls around so she cleaned the place up part of it anyway so a man a man good to be here good to be back good to be in the house with Lord good to have each and every one of you here you got your Bibles let's go ahead and turn to the Book of Revelations 8 verse 1 and we're gonna speak today on three poles we're talking about less Sonny will kind of catch a little bit of it this Sunday I want to try to get finished we've got next Sunday we got brother Jul here then the next Sunday I'll be in Arizona and the end of this month and August we've got all kinds of scheduling going on we've already got August almost full with brothers coming from foreign countries so we get to take a little break but I hope we can get finished with the seventh seal by then because I'd like to start on Daniel 70 weeks so we want to do it like we did downstairs and take it from a Jewish perspective because it is for the to the Jews it's not to us it is to the Jews we get a spiritual application of it but we've been over it I was looking back on the computer and we'd started doing doing the series in 2006 wow that's a long time ago so that identity since 1974 but we all kind of went through a cycle and then we went downstairs and did it two years ago we will we will Lord willing when we get finished here with the Seventh Seal we'll we'll start on Daniel seventy week so just keep us in your prayers and you know what to do pray the guard to give us a revelation of what's going on in the world we got earthquakes in divers places we got all these different things go we got a new election coming up we got a lot of things moving and shaking so 2019 is going to shape up to be a to be a year to remember I think I think we've grown in Revelation which to me that's the most important I don't care for California falls off them to the moon and I really don't care but as long as you've got a good revelation he'll hold you during the time of all this confusion that's going on everywhere else so god bless you remember each and every one to sake remember brother Boyd he's hurting a little bit today so we pray this to him Lord would bless him and and totally healing before the service is over with amen some nomads that's right this is the place to feel good you know this is the place to feel better here this is the place to come to if you feel bad you need them you need a new birth you know if you feel bad if you feel good then take that new birth and apply it to your body and let it let it yield to what's already inside of you all right so that's what we're we're looking for is for that inside man to take over mmm because by the new birth he's already there so we ain't gonna go get him or go find him he's already there so let's bow our heads and get started tell me Father we thank you Lord for this day we thank you for these wonderful people Lord they're the most special people in the face of the earth because they're your bride Lord they're the ones that had been chosen before the foundation of the world and you saw them sitting here hearing the word and how they would respond you knew all that before the foundation of the world so lord I pray that we'll all truly listen and hear from you today Lord and as Dwight Moody always says it says you'll fill those Lord who are not full of their self so let's get ourselves out of the way and let you come in and take over Lord you do the speaking you do the hearing you do the revealing father we got you just be with the ones that are sick the ones that are not here brother dick brother Colley brother Daugherty sister Johnny the ones that are not with us Lord we pray that you just touch their body the ones that are here Lord by the board certain ones that are going through different things here little situations of life because of the fall but Lord you said you would restore you said I will restore so Lord we pray that you'll do that today father just restore everything back Lord we pray Lord that you just be with us in our journey be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor Lord the prejudiced you just bless us now take care of us lead us and guide us by your love and jesus name we pray amen and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour Eirene John 19 when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost now Ephesians 4:30 and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption you may be seated in the Lord adds blessing to the reading of the word now I want to I want to go back to that Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of redemption now what brother Dale was preaching he's trying to get us all sealed once he gets us all sealed in then you've sealed Satan out but we still have a work to do in the spirit realm it moves out into the spirit realm you don't have to go through justification if you that's why the Bible says those who he's justified he's already glorified you don't have to go through that baby form of justification ever again because that person inside of you that comes and gives you the new birth they never seem to start with so there's no justification that you have to go through again as far as that's concerned but you do have to go through a justification in the next realm or the spirit realm because today what we're going to try to talk about is a three-fold manner that this seventh sea was opened up to the Prophet and I want to read you a few quotes and get you started but look at these threes everything's in three threefold minor three the sixth seal had had three different parts to it mmm your new birth has three different parts to it because three is what its perfection so God is perfected not God is perfected in threes your perfected in God in threes God doesn't need perfection hey man he's already perfect but for him to bring you to perfection he does it in three folds or three ways called justification sanctification in the baptism of Holy Ghost all right and for us to be able to understand him that's the way he's working and the way he works it never changes so we're talking about this morning a Bible study at once God does something he's got to do it the same way every time so the the problem we have with us humans is that we have so much change in our life that we think God changes God doesn't change you can depend on what he said in this word from now until eternity you just keep on going he's going to be the same yesterday today and forever there's your three fold same yesterday you got threes coming up so now we look and we know that that brother brown said that this seventh seal opened in a three-fold manner and before we get started let me read you the definition of fold fold is to lay one part over another all right you understand what I'm saying fold when you fold something you lay one part over the other all right we used to fold a map for those of us that are old enough to remember we used to have physical maps and we folded them all right now Google Maps doesn't do that anymore but now remember you've got to look at one thing as far as our computers go it is in layers already are in folds you got things running behind other things so you've got them in folks or what's happening is there's something going on and then there's something going on underneath same way with God we see that we see God moving and he might be moving brother Boyd in in justification he might be with brother Martin sanctification but it's all God and he's working in a fold of a way to where that he's getting what he needs he's getting what he needs everybody's getting what their need their needs are met but you know why they're met they're met because of your desire it all hinges on you God will never open your brain and pour it down he only goes by what you desire that's what I told him this morning I'm gonna tell you all sitting here today if you're not going to church as much as you were two years ago you need the new birth you are lost the Bible says and more as the day approaches what's wrong with that sly brother Dale says you tell the Holy Ghost field woman Holy Ghost Phil one won't wear a pair of pants well if you put on a pair of pants or if you cut your hair you don't have the Holy Ghost it's just real ABC if you don't have more desire to come here like last night in a Bible study fifty something people and I know there's things to do life and all but still what's your desire you got a lot of time to do the things of the world yeah you got about six days to do the things of the world give God a couple of days and I'll promise you some of your problems that you have will go away you got money problems you're not tithing if you know if you got problems in your spiritual life you must not be praying enough you must not be reading your Bible enough you must not be coming to church enough that's pretty simple pray and read your Bible brother Brown I mean you know we try to we bring these great things out and we see that we're on the Seventh Seal which is the greatest the greatest happening since the dawn of time is that God's got a group of people here that he's trying to show what he's already done now what he's going to do what he's already done and he's doing it in your life now if you'll let him do it you can stop dart at any time that's why I love what brother Bram said about the holy ghost said the holy ghost was the gentleman he will not kick your door down and go into a door that you shut in your life if you shut a door and don't want him to go in that room he will not go in that room now that what strange to me is he knows what's in that room he knows what your problem is but if you don't open the door he's not gonna go in there because of what your free moral agency you are a free moral agent you decide whether you keep on going or you decide whether you stop it's all up to you you can't blame God you can't blame nobody but yourself I don't blame nobody but me for the problems that I have because you know what I live with it and I probably are the one that caused most of it like 99.999999 9 there's a little anomaly in there everyone's want somebody may cause you a problem but usually it's your fault amen so feel if you'll do that and just keep it in that lathe and everything will be fine but what are we doing here now are we coming up to this time now we see earthquakes we see all these things different things that are coming on the world yet we're still not wanting it was still just we just don't come to church and don't you know we just don't study don't read don't what are we doing do you think just one day God's gonna just walk in here and just gonna pour water over all of us and we're just gonna get it that's not his way of doing things that's not his way just like we were talking about this morning God couldn't give Martin Luther what we have today it would have choked him that was afraid of a sentence it's Frater was was tough said she said well that just answers my question well well I mean you don't you know you don't take little William or any little babies back here we're gonna go eat at Cracker Barrel no not a Cracker Barrel nevermind Lord sorry no a lot what's wrong with that but anyway if we go take the little baby somewhere we say okay we're gonna go to Longhorns and we're gonna give him a steak well now he's a human he could take the steak but it probably would kill him cuz he would choke on it has no teeth and that's what you are with God when you're a but spirit babe in Christ God knows you don't have teeth God knows you need to be spoon-fed you need to have stuff chewed up and fed to your little piece at a time well that's the way it is same way with the with a natural birth brother Dale's trying to get us all born again amen and then we can eat little pieces until we get to a place to where I mean God forbid we've been in this message for 50 years and we can't eat meat you ought to be able to eat meat and it not choke you the 11th hour worker got paid the same amount of money for one hour of work as the people that worked in 11 hours till that levinthal worker comes in and he got the same wage why because God's doing a work he's really giving it to us he's giving it to us in abundance but he's chewing it up by fivefold ministry giving it out to the people or even in song and then all the different than going give yourself a hand clap because it's for you you know it's for you it's not not nothing special in our book I mean come on brother now spent 5060 years studying this message while we I say we me went out 20 years in the world wasted God's time right amen we've all wasted our time somewhere in times past well this you know what we're running out of time because a Seventh Seal is the end of time of all things it's coming up to a place to wear this thing you know you think wow grandma said it was coming fifty years ago and grandma's grandma said it was coming fifty years ago and grandmas grandma grandma said well Jesus is coming any moment well you what this is the moment I don't see any other thing that's gonna give us another 50 years or another five years maybe okay or another one year if God wants to do a work real quick he's going to do a work real quick but we need to see this in a simplified form to where when brother Graham talks to the Seventh Seal we say well it's so great people's made it this and they made it that they made it polygamy they made it and you all the false doctrines you just name them and that's what comes they said well that's the Seventh Seal and then you know you got you got some people that did think the seven seals not open and you got some people think so it is and then ain't and well we're gonna read some quotes here from me but let's look at number one I left just background a little bit just for a second number one says he breaks the seal reveals we've read these but we're going to keep reading them because it it ought to set your mind in order for what we're coming to hear he breaks the seals he breaks the seals okay reveals gives us his inheritance to his people now you know what the opening these seals are it's not to get you born again it's not please realize one thing's for sure more people are going to be born again that don't know one thing about a seal than they are that is if I understand that Paul Iranians Martin Columba Luther Wesley Pentecost and even in brother branham's day have not had the seals open just like you and I have had them open right okay so this is a specialist tell them downstairs this morning this is your a special group of people you're the only people friend Freda said why didn't he just give it all to Martin Luther I said because the one thing you you take your finger this is the reason that Martin Luther didn't get everything and went in a rapture this is the reason John Wesley did not get everything and take a rapture this is the reason that Pentecost did not take a rapture when they were so close to going into rapture it's because I mean you sitting right here today if you want to define your life it's that God's gonna finish everything through you that's what a Seventh Seal is if they made it everything external they made it this and this happening in this tent in a and this and this and I read you we're gonna read it again if it's not Christ in you the hope of glory there's nothing else left folks there's not another bright list and there's not another message we got to study thank God we don't have to study another 50 years for another man that's coming we don't have to this is it and it's gonna come to me or you or somebody I'm just dumb enough to think he's gonna do it through me and you - you need to say that yourself he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited now what did he inherit he inherited eternal life in his body that's what the seven seals are for they're not to get you born again they're to take that born again and make it an atom bomb I mean make it an atomic bomb not just a little Martin Luther head of little yeah a little button amen but he didn't have a word like we're talking about now he didn't have a prophet to come in the end time to tie up those loose ends and so that you know what when you tie the loose ends what are you tying up you're tying up a rope tying up loose ends what then it's going to be in continuity so this message it's coming in so so much continuity to where God's gonna have to come on this thing God's gonna have to come and honor what he said he was gonna do cuz we're gettin it we're getting lined up we're getting lined up with hair and dress and don't smoke and don't do this no no ain't get like you need to be passed out Paul says leaving again the principles of doctrine o'clock let's go on to perfection not laying again the foundation why don't we need another foundation brother that was trying to help you get morning in now if you're already boarding in you got the foundation build on it because everything you're gonna get is internal there is no external happening that's gonna get you born again there is no external happening that's going to cause the dad to come out of the ground it's going to be internal it's inside you right now if you're born again but instead of keeping it in himself he gives it back to the people that's his love for us number two breech one of these seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in these seals every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals in the seals cannot be broken until that time see the seals couldn't be broken under Luther's day couldn't be broken under wesley today couldn't be broken under pentecost today and it wasn't broke only to a prophet back in the sixties I'm just reading you what he said remember he said it's gone from you you're not supposed to get it that's why I said you and I are the only people aren't here to get it the pack stone have passed on it's us it's up to you and I to carry this thing on the whole ministry lays in these seals every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals in the seals cannot be broken until that time all right it's a book of redemption so what we're talking about is the book of redemption now look at number three it is the rising of the Sun this is where we were last Sunday Earth's two Sundays ago he is the one who opened those seals all right brother mom didn't open the seal he was there and God opened the seals through him he had to have a trumpet or a voice but Christ is the only one who can open those seals and then for the whole Word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was open not an ant Christ what is the opening of seals then revealing Christ so where we said where is Christ Christ is in you let's look at what that word means that word means anointed was the Messiah the son of God alright keep going to the next one which is Christo's alright the next one is I like that one 1b in doing Christians with the gifts of the Holy Spirit gifts there's nine spiritual gifts but the Keith was talking about it to us the other day well if you're born again you're in line for those spiritual gifts if you're not born again then you need to get born again then you're in line for those nine spiritual gifts for them to work in your life alright and as if the Jesus Christ it consecrating Jesus to the Masonic office then what brother Brown called us little messiahs so we got to see this connection we've disconnected ourselves man has disconnected ourselves with God God's never disconnected himself to us we have disconnected ourselves to God by thinking he's the second person or somebody else not what I'm fixing to read you let's go to the next one Colossians 1:26 we've read this a million times we're gonna read it again even the mystery which has been hit from ages from generation but now it's made manifest to who to help his Saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery amongst the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every men and all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus what without Christ in you you're not but with Christ in you that part of you is perfect can y'all Amen just a little bit louder okay well you can say on me if you want to but you name n if you wish all right let's go to the next to Matthew 24 except those days should be shortened there's been no flesh saved for the elects sake those days shall be shortened how about that that's a promise what because somebody's gonna say lo here is Christ believe it not but there sure arrives false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before he's telling you again wherefore if you shall say they now who died say last couple of Sundays who's they they are false people false preachers if they shall say unto you behold he is in filling the blank just fill in the blank go not forth behold his in the secret chambers oh man that sounds good being a secret chamber with God believe it not why because if he's in you you know where Christ is this is so elementary that you think y'all I know what y'all thought you thought well this seventh seal is gonna be some great thing we're just gonna take a rap it's no more than what we've just been talking about how can it be any different than what's in the Bible how can it be any different than your new birth how can be any different than your everyday life how can it be any different what it's just making you realize who you are and what you're doing here they ought to make a quote about that right friend for as the Lightning cometh out of the east and shines even to the west so shall also the coming of the Son of man now where is the coming of the Son of Man where is it at where is the coming of the Son of Man app in his bride nowhere else not in a place not that's what I mean it's not external it and we're looking at all these that well what about California so what so what big deal we know lisam plight brother Ernie Villanueva said we've read we've read tomorrow's news today we know there's gonna be California I'm going to the destruction and all these things but I'm not worried about it every day I mean if some kind of well we're humans after 9/11 church membership grew by a hundred percent why cuz they thought maybe this was the destruction of the beginning of the destruction of the world so we're all gonna start going to church and I'm sure other churches did too but you know what this church didn't you get solid in the word these things don't bother you you get solid in the message these little trivial things do not bother you they do not bother me when they had the earthquake the other day you know when I said brother Boyd I said it's because something's happening right here not something happening in the stars it's happening right here there's something going on in this earth right that's causing that to happen and I was thinking this morning you know this it's really kind of sad because you know thank well we talked about God and we had a prophet come and pronounce judgment and he pronounced judgment we know beyond a shadow of a doubt even if all the bride gets together in one place and prays California's gonna sink because they turned the word down California's going to sink so we can't change God's mind okay we can't if you put a George Washington Abraham Lincoln in every office in the United States ain't gonna change the politics you think what God can do God can only do what His Word says he cannot do any different than what His Word says so that judgment then is already there but it has zero to do with me but I have a lot to do with it because it's going to happen listen the resurrection is not just going to happen because it's gonna happen the resurrection is going to happen when you and I come to a place to where death is destroyed in your body death is destroyed in what you have already inside of you because remember death is destroyed already for a Christian some of you need a resurrection right now Freddy you're doing good though you that's okay that would keep you look if everybody will start Fanning it'll keep you awake if you don't then if you go to sleep then you know free to eat some fruit today with um honey on it and she said she'll be going to sleep bison I lie to keep you awake we sell honey Romans 10 verse 10 6 if listen I bring every one of you a jar if you stay awake I wouldn't care if you I told them I said the best thing to do is bring you a bowling ball with you the church next Sunday lean up hold it like this over your feet I'll guarantee you'll stay awake but if you do go to sleep one time you won't go sleep again we'll be praying for your toes could that be broke alright romans 10 look watch roman tenses but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh in this wise go see we got to put this in the Bible you have to put the Seventh Seal in the Bible brother Branham we're going to talk about in a minute where he talks about the threefold revelation but it's all in the Bible but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven you know the Bible said that twice didn't you that is to bring Christ down from above or shall descend into the deep that is to bring Christ again from the dead you see what we're doing everybody I'm telling you one more time we have as message believers we have looked at external happenings they are signpost but they're not the vehicle you are the vehicle there are signposts that will tell you danger ahead but listen like I said before there's nothing going to change what the Prophet said about the United States of America it's doomed but I don't want to be here during that doom I want to be out of here don't you but what says it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart so that is the Word of Faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with our mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved amen first Corinthians two verse 16 for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him Paul said but we have the mind of Christ to know to do what needs to be done when it needs to be done right you know why cuz he will give you what brother Brian told us he said we were supernatural people with supernatural insight prophetic people he gave us all these titles that we are not using he told us what we were going to be now back when he was preaching there was a lot of Pentecostal babies that had not grown up yet but now you and I are grown are growing up because we have the statue of a perfect man we have a good teaching ministry here to pick you up to tell you that there's more sure the Holy Ghost is the greatest thing and the greatest thing ever happened in your life but that's not it please don't take that new baby that you have and put it over in the corner and leave it there it will die feed it but we have the mind of Christ no you're not that you're bought you know I was thinking the other day brother Branham talked about counting down and about pressurization and how that we're pressurized for this do you know it I was thinking this morning when brother Dale was preaching and you take pressurization the pressure that we have on us today because we're facing either death resurrection or we're going through the tribulation we're facing that we're not facing well we're gonna throw it to Martin Luther while we're gonna throw it to John Wesley where we're this is it because I'm gonna read to you when we talk about the Seventh Seal now you're talking about the end of all things the end of everything is coming upon us right here in the front of our face but you and I have so much pressure you say well and we do have we do have a lot of natural pressure that we have from work and blah blah blah and things like that but the spiritual pressure is what's put on us do you realize even when brother Branham was talking about radio waves when he was talking about radio waves going through the building at that time there was only AM radio maybe some ham radio governmental radio you understand what I'm saying TV and that was that there was no cellphone there was no internet Wi-Fi none of that stuff going on in the airwaves you and I today going through this building subconsciously and supernaturally I was thinking about this yesterday subconsciously and supernaturally every day you're fighting demons that you can't even see because you know what coming through this building right now it's everything that's on that internet pornography whatever you want to say filth child all that bad stuff that you think is out there set a computer right here and you can pick it all up well you know what it is it's airwaves it's waves that's going through this building and you know what it's bombarding it's bombarding that's why I read that but we have the mind of Christ only the mind of Christ can deal with it other than that you look at the world and see how crazy they are you know ever cell phone conversation that's going on within about a hundred miles of here's going right through this building all the cursing and the adultery and you understand what I'm saying God has give us a shelter it's called the Holy Ghost it's called the mind of Christ he's given to me in you to what to make sure that that doesn't bother us we've been pressurized for this moment right here Martin Luther I'm sorry Martin Luther would probably go crazy in just a few moments of all the pressures and demons that we have to deal with on a daily basis but if you have the mind of Christ how can Satan get in your mind he can't oh he can try to punch it in a little at a time but folks when you're sitting reading your Bible all that's still going right through the building when you're praying to God you know what all them demons are still floating right through your as as much as we want to put the token over our house and I hope we all have it's not impenetrable to all that because your kids could be in the bedroom doing something that they shouldn't be on the phone why because that stuff's going right through your house in that fourth dimension that's why the Bible says he'll have to enlarge this gates what to pack in all this junk that's going through the through the airwaves that we don't see but you know what there's a God there's a God that will protect you there is a God that has already told you we have the mind of Christ we just got to let it out because even with all this going on we are going to take a body change we are going to not have to walk out into the graveyards and call the dead out of the ground no they're going to walk right among us but it's gonna come from your external nothing I mean from your internal nothing external nothing so don't worry about this and going what's gonna happen in doing this and what natin don't worry listen we're facing a lot of things in our own ranks don't deal don't worry about just make sure it doesn't affect you Amen you can't change the world but you can change you amen you can't change the world but you can change you know you're not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot god forbid what knowing you not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body in other words spirits demons whatever you want to call us what we're talking about say if he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit brother Dale is not teaching two or three different kinds of Holy Ghost it's one the spirit by one spirit are you baptized into this body and it doesn't matter I told the Sunday School this morning I delivering mail light beats my fingers that well I got a hangnail and I started to go and I started to quit work I was hurting but you know what yeah and you've got kids double sorry but no but it aggravated me why because it's part of my body and when I hit that thing on a mailbox I heard from my toes to my nose why well that's the same way with the body of Christ if we have a problem in the body you know why it hurts everybody we must all come and be joined unto the Lord is one spirit that's what we're looking at we're looking at that one not that you and I are gonna say the same thing but truly when somebody says something about the Word of God you ought to be able to say it man you ought to be able to respond to it you know Haddie Wright was standing probably washing her dishes this is how holy this whole thing is she was sending out washing her dishes and brother branham was setting it in her kitchen I believe or at a table and brother Branham was telling her an experience that he had had right right he was telling her an experience that he had had and she just looks over now she didn't pray she wasn't shy she wasn't probably even in a mood of worship she was watching dishes have you sisters ever gotten a spirit washing dishes I know it's probably but he wasn't a good one but anyway so she's what I'm telling you is that she's she's in her environment of her home and something is fixing to happen that had never happened before huh we think we gotta have all that she just looked over at brother branham and she said that ain't nothing but the truth and Buddy that opened a portal from God Almighty himself and he spoke to that prophet he said you tell her she has asked whatever she wants that ain't nothing but the truth try that sometime try that when brother Dale was preaching or somebody's preaching he said that ain't nothin but the truth and see what God would do for you he took a poor woman that didn't have enough money brother Branham said she could ask for all kind of money had a sister sitting in the wheelchair but she asked for something eternal she said the salvation of my two sons amen and God honored that right there try it sometime that ain't much truth what know you not that which adjoins a harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit all right let's go to Roman's oh the next one but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ being you the body is dead because of sin hmm but the Spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you that's pretty powerful but it's all done by class what do brother Brown say the 7c it was or the stills were revealing Christ not revealing whatever whatever you want to in there it's revealing Christ in you the hope of glory all right let's look at the Seventh Seal let's get into this just for a second we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things that's right the things written in the seventh sealed book sealed up of the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the world it every bit ends it is the end it is the end of the struggling world now remember it's not the end of the world God's not going to destroy this earth right he's just gonna change it it's the end of the struggling world it's the end of struggling nature it's the end of everything and there is the end of the trumpets at the end of the vial to see into the earth it's the end of time time runs out the Bible says so where in we know where it says that in Revelation 10 but you wonder I was telling I was telling myself the other day having an intelligent conversation I saw one time I ever do haven't told the conversation what was that it's the end of everything you you're looking at though number seven and I want to explain this to you because I think the Lord kind of just checked me on that you say it's the end of it look it's the end of the trumpets because remember when we the end of the end of time for us is when we take a body change but now remember that seventh seal goes all the way over to Israel I just want to throw that in that's it it sure it ends for our dispensation but remember when God in something that means he begins something else all right so what he's doing is he's ending the seventh seal is the end of all things the end of the earth but what it has to carry it to - it carries all the way to the future home he cares all because remember earth earth Redemption is still in the seven right and even in the millennium it's still in the seven the eighth day is the future home now you and I enter our eighth day here if you're born again you've already entered that eighth day amen so what's gonna happen is is your body's got to catch up to that everybody ok with that say Amen your body's got to catch up to that your souls already just it never can be any more eternal than it is right now but your body is suffering but it will be changed look man has tried to change your we try to change our body externally for years hair color facelift I want to be changed you know what if I can get changed internally I may be I may look as old as Freedom Roberts but if listen folks Frieden I go back a long way I'm so glad she's here I am so glad that she has that you know what she made a decision she made a decision and I doesn't matter that she's here I'm just glad that she's back listening and doing the things of God she was my first girlfriend if y'all didn't know that so yeah well I spent a long time but it's the end of everything I'm reading the rest of the quote so I'm with this family I like for people sister barber you okay I've never seen her laugh that much well Wow you need to take a break need some water she's hiding behind you after she's but no I like to see when family comes by your family I'm being honest you only all our family and when you know when you're not here I miss you and same here right you know when somebody says glad to have you back that means a lot we're glad to see you again you know why because there's a kindred spirit there it's not just it's not just you know you can tell a co-worker let's just be honest you can tell a co-worker oh it's good to have you back that's just you're just filling in space I mean really some of them employees you are really not glad to think anybody to work amen amen but I'm glad when y'all are going or we're gone or something and we come back in somebody shakes your hand or hold your neck and say glad to have you back you know why because it's two-spirit it's the same spirit talking to each other amen so just real and you know what that's the seventh seal the seventh seal is the end of all this other junk that's going on outside and it's bringing us to a place it's the end of everything they're not something at the end of the trumpets into the bowels see because God goes right on over to Israel the seventh seal is Christ right so Christ is going to go to the two through the two witness isn't going to bring out 144,000 people and then Christ is going to come back with a wife we were talking about that this morning God's not coming after a bride we've been bride down through 7 church ages he's coming back to get a wife because revelations 19 said his wife has two made herself ready he's coming to get him a tour by mature wife that was sure it's his bride you can say that that's okay but you know what I don't introduce tune and it's cute to say this is my bride no it's best to say this is my wife this is my husband this is my wife why because we've all matured Jim knows how Jim just knows how to handle me think y'all should say thank God because you know y'all else have to the man thank you praise the Lord but you know what God's the same way God only handles his wife he don't handle nobody else and she knows how it's supposed to know how to handle him you understand in all things because if we have the mind of Christ you have the mind of the bridegroom inside of you that's about that's what we were talking about the other day Adam and Eve listen before the fall Adam and Eve the Prophet weak we forget those quotes where he said they were coequal her name was not Eve her name was Adam she was him literally and that's what's changing us back to my atoms are not gonna be changed back to Samuel and Peggy Dale that's what they are now that's my problem now and getting older but when they change back to him that's when debt see that's one destined to be destroyed those people are gonna walk right through the wall walk right in here and say it's about time amen that's what I say brother boy bring it on whatever it is bring it on because we're coming to the end of something we're coming to the end of the struggling world we're coming to the end of the bowels into the earth the end of the plagues everything from the foundation of the world it's looking right here every prophet that has died and went before has looked and saw a little piece of the end time what the Old Testament prophecies of the old of the of the end time they didn't just see right up to Christ no they saw all the way the end Isaiah saw all the way to the future home right but you know what you say well that's just words no that's you comes without you it's not gonna happen that's why you're the word made flesh now it's the end of the church age it's the end of the seven seals it's the end of the trumpets into the vials it's the end of its even ends the ushering in of the Millennium that's on the seventh seal now you see that even ends the ushering in of the Millennium think about that now watch let's go to the next number seven let's talk about this what brother I'm saw mm-hmm well let's read this one first I'm sorry thank you I Sabina canyon he said this is the third fall I won't ask you a question same thing when you say third Pole deep what do you think about what do you think of hmm thank you better think of you you're the recipient of it you are the third pole because the third pole the prophet of God said is the opening of the word not a tent not of this not of that not all that issue remember what I said it's all gonna happen internally it's not gonna happen in anything external now there's gonna things happen external because of what happens internal just like the California and all these things I believe as we walk closer into the word that we're going to come to a place to where rebirth pains this place is ready to explode and it will not do it until we're ready amen there's three great things that go with it and one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today nice talking about the three fold opening of that seal there's one thing that I cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language and we'll talk about that maybe a couple of few Sundays from now but I was standing right there and look right straight at it and this is the third pole coming up now what is the third pole it's the opening of the word period it's do whatever you want to call it it's the opening of the word now that's what he said all right but I was standing there right it's the third pole coming up and the Holy Spirit of God oh my that's the reason all heaven was silent oh my eye just shows us from God for it fits exactly in the promises of God from the end of the message now notice now notice now for the end of time message we'll talk about the end of time message this seal after all he's revealed all I need to be able to read the rest of that he's revealed all the six seals now look this is where somebody says well the seventh seal is not open but it don't say nothing about the seventh and the end time seal when it starts now remember it's open in a three-fold manner he just said three things happen one was the day before one was that day and one he couldn't read right I just read that I'm just telling you what he said he's revealed all the six seals but it don't say nothing about the seventh why there's nothing to write on the board there's no in other words there's no nothing happening no action but there is something going on because remember it like I keep reading that scripture about Jesus gave up the ghost remember Jesus was dead the body was dead it's like the world said hey we've got him the devil said we got him there's nothing going on but look he was paying for me and you during that whole time he said I've acted like he was laying in the tomb cold dead he was down in hell he was into paradise took them up and redeemed me in you during that whole time of silence were they acted like there was nothing going on boy did he pull something over on Satan's eyes I still what he's doing now and the endtime seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible now that's why he told the people on the sixth seal he's has gone from you it's not for you you're not going to get it but you and I are not those people we are going to get it we are going to get it it's for us it was not for them it was for us we are at the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible how can it be a total secret and be anything external anything they didn't move for a half an hour in heaven brother brown said it would give away the secret they didn't move for a half an hour they did not move a my soul I'm just reading what he said they didn't move why because you know what he said he said it may give away the secret the secret let's talk about that secret here just right now that's number six this is the seventh seal no angel singing no praises no altar service no nothing there was silence hush deadly silence in heaven for a half hour Bella I ask you where's Bella remember I asked you to be still for 10 seconds she couldn't do it couldn't do it but they were asked to be silent and not moved for half an hour when the Seventh Seal mystery in the book of redemption was broke open now remember it looks like he said a minute ago that it wasn't broke but it's broke I know somebody had said something the other day about me and brother Dale didn't believe the Seventh Seal is open listen the very reason I'm standing here today is that the Seventh Seal is open the very reason you walked in this door today and sat down and listened to whoever you going to listen to reveals that the seal is open because the Seventh Seal is just like the other ones it's revealing Christ not a person now look to the world he is sealed to the world there's no way they can get this I'm just telling you what brother I'm saying I'll tell you what the Bible says it's a secret but now the secret remember brother Branham says the mystery has now been made history where has it been made history at in you that's where the mystery has been hid from the foundation of the world it's been Christ in you the hope of glory you say well that's just too simple that's why we've missed it for all these years it's been so simple we thought we thought it was tidal wave remember last night those of you that were here there was and we were just talking about something somebody said well there'll be tidal waves all the way to Kentucky he never said that he only spoke a tidal wave seven times and one of them is to Arizona and that's as far as it goes and he will say so I thought this title would I said I can make a tidal wave in my bathtub think about any other way you wanted to right so but you know what though it's what we're taught you know grandma died and walking on the streets to go with Jesus no she's not no she's not no she's not but we've been told that so many times till we just say that you go to a funeral home and the first thing they say oh mama she's walking on the streets to go with you now I mean not message believers but don't some people she's walking on the streets to go with Jesus right now no she's not but she's been told that so many times now we will be one day but we had a prophet come and told us and know they're in the sixth dimension under the altar can't get to Jesus at this moment so we have the truth folks we have the truth that's been give to us because what the seal has been broke the lamb breaks it now where today is the lamb inside of you that lamb is your Redeemer and he's your redemption so where is your redemption that in this not at the moment but that's what Christ in you I'm telling you Christ in you the hope of glory is the whole thing you know what they were awed by it I believe they didn't know there it was they just stopped now who's he don't might stop angels now let me ask you a question do angels know anything about redemption even the greatest angels that God ever made Satan himself knows nothing remember we sing that song the angels all will listen for they cannot join that song the John because their silence in heaven because redemption doesn't happen in heaven redemption happens right here so that's there for there was silence in heaven because they did not understand what was going on there's only one man that understands what's going on and that's the lamb and when he breaks the seal what do you do - what'd he do with it I just read it he hands it to who you he hands it to you redemption is not in that wall or in that pew it's sitting on that pew Redemption doesn't happen to anything but humans now all the other you said what about the world what about that it happens because you come to a place it happens because you come to a place all nature fell because of you now all nature is coming back because of you but you got to come to that place first now none of us know but I'm going to tell you in my my revelation be that's not it's not a problem with with us telling it in our revelation as long as it compares with the revelation of the Bible it can be a way Dell quote what's wrong with that if it's if it's according to the Bible it's according to the word I didn't really doesn't bother me but he's gonna that's okay for brother Brown to tell us of his revelation but it's the problem when we interject our own self I guess it is but now look you said I'm not prone to be a fanatic if I am I'm ignorant of it see I'm not giving to such now has nobody can say Illyria like he can to such hilarious look that up in the dictionary our carry owns and imaginary things I've said some things might be in kind of strange to some people but when God comes around behind it and vindicates it in other words they have to shut up if God vindicates it they have to shut up and says it's the truth and that's God's Word it may seem strange that way and now a certain as I'm standing on the platform door night I had the revelation that revealed this in a three-fold manner that's what we're talking about and running out of time that I will speak of you by God's help of a fold of it now and then let's go over there first here's a revelation to begin what I want to tell you what it is what happens is that those seven thunders that he heard thunder it was forbidden to write that's what the mystery is laying behind those seven consecutive thunders rolling out so it goes right back to the opening or to those Thunder sounding now we went through that hole part of the Thunder sounding and where does it sound brother Brown said the seven thunders sound on earth and who's here to receive it trees cars thank you y'all forgot that I am thing huh yeah so where's it going to happen it's gonna happen in you the seven thunders is what you're gonna hear not seven men listen not seven external yeah you're gonna have to hear it through your ears but you know what God speaks to you you don't have to have ears right a deaf person can hear from God so you don't have to have physical ears God can speak right into your mind and that's what he's doing now because if you listen to what I'm saying to you you might get confused if you listen to my physical words that I'm saying but if God ever speaks to you inside of the inside it's never wrong never wrong if something ever tells you that you're bad and you're awful and you're horrible is Satan it's not God now God may give you like I said me he may give you a little whack every once in a while but he's wanting to speak to what if you're his child he'll speak to you if you're his child he's obligated to speak to you mmm so this isn't a three-fold mystery all right now look brother Brown told us because we can break it down but I don't want to do it real quick but I'm gonna let brother branham break it down because he said if you don't get it in the seals go to what message Christ is the mystery of God revealed come back to this message he said Christ is the cross Christ and they all ever heard that before so let's go to Christ is a mystery God reveal let's go to number eight or number seven let's read this real quick okay he's talking right now what he's doing on the seventh seal he's going back talking about the sixth seal because the whole earth is to be purged he so much as it's sealed now do you notice on the opening of this seventh seal it's also in a three-fold mystery this one I have will speak and have spoke that it is the mystery of the seven thunders the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery it'll be right at the coming of Christ so I'm talking about right now he's talking about right now no other time but right now because Christ said no one knew when he would return everybody okay with that so now let's go to number eight brother Branham opens up talking about Christ as the mystery of God revealed on paragraph 140 first thing he starts he goes through all the preliminary tells you about different things going on this is where he begins now notice God's has had a three-fold purpose in this great mystery secret if I got that same am that's what he just said in the seventh seal it was opened in the threefold matter God in this great mystery secret that he had before the world began he's got a three-fold purpose in it and now what do you want to go upon this morning what we want to go upon this morning it's what is that three full purpose he didn't cover it so much in the seventh seal but he's fixing the cover here because he said if he didn't get in the seals come back to this message right here so we're coming back to this message right here now the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people now listen when you get born again god it's like brother Dale said brother Brown says that you got a little button okay you got a little part of God which is God doesn't matter if it's a molecule of God it's God all right and that makes you God hello all right but he gives you that the first thing was God wanted to reveal himself to the people now that's the same thing with you and I he wants to reveal himself to us not just get us born again that's one purpose but he wants to make us a living breathing instrumentality of God he wants to be able to use us in the way that he used Adam and Eve before the fall he said here this is your earth you take care of it the first thing was God one to reveal himself to his people he couldn't do it as great Jehovah God who covered all space time and eternity he could not he is too great to ever be revealed to people well if you stopped it right there then we're done but thank God he keeps speaking through the prophet he is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great beam that never did begin that after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space then out into the infinity into the eternity and a great creature that was all that and still is now remember what is the seven seals revealing Christ and where is Christ in you but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become the son of man because he had to be our brother son of God is not our brother son of God is God Creator God all right we done been to all this he had to become human flesh so that we could be heirs and joint heirs with him to start the plan of redemption one day this will excite you they didn't know what he was talking about many of them and you and I the same way when we first come in the message did you understand everything no but now do well the astilbe owe you more than you mourn you work you're not a baby you're not crawling you're walking on two feet and the only way that you could express it was to become a son of man that's the reason Jesus kept saying just on a man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it congregation says they men see he wanted to express his self the whole part of the opening of the seven selves folks is for God to express himself in people if it's the plan of redemption it's the plan of redemption for you and me this is so simple this is too simple because you're thinking this way up yonder this whole people in the message think the great Seventh Seal in the seven thunders is something way out yonder that I'm talking about your simple born-again life that is growing in Christ and the only way you can do that is come to church and you got to listen to God in human flesh talk to God in human flesh see that don't make didn't see then that don't make us no different than y'all it's God in human flesh talking to God in human flesh how in the world can we fail you can't fail when - I'm nepeta talk to each other we already been through that brother Graham said when to omnipotence meet well let's realize it and let's grow in it he wanted to express itself that was his one of his great three-fold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings oh what a mystery to reveal his self in Christ second to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in people first fall was what God wanted to reveal itself to his people because you can't understand God until he reveals himself to you first then you get the revelation and he does what he comes inside of you that he might live not with people live in people everybody got that say ma'am let's keep going paragraph 146 when I think of it I just see denominations pass off the scene and everything else just going see when I see God's great purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the Godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of Godhead bodily into a people if he was the fullness of the Godhead boggling he has now transferred that into me and you I'm just telling you what brother Brahm said and then to bring that fullness of Godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminence is the oversight the leading they all rights amen all right now let's read number nine we got we got communion today I'm communing pretty good right now you communing pretty good not now what's the threefold matter what's the threefold opening first to express himself completely God in Christ now what did he tell us on the seventh seal it opened in a three-fold manner he told us of one fold of it all God was reporting to Christ because what is the seals revealing Christ but in revealing Christ he's got to reveal where Christ is and his Christ in you the hope of glory second to have the preeminence in spy this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the premises to express himself through them and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its Riley position that fell by sin by the first item back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them fellowshipped with them amen so the end of time seal that's why I read that seventh seal he said it carries us into the Millennium what is the Millennium it's the beginning or a starting of Eden he's carrying us back to the Garden of Eden condition amen let me read that to you that okay they don't have this quotes but I'm gonna read it mm-hmm I pulled it up in back there Christ as a mystery God reveal if you can get paragraph 580 back there guys if you can because brother Ryan says see when we see all these great threefold revelation God in Christ Christ in the church the kingdom coming Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden of Eden and the representation of Christ and his bride and then the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise now what's the first kingdom he's got to restore the one you living in so that tells me there's a body change all right then the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise praise be to God let's read it again when we see all these things great three full revelation guarding Christ Christ in the church cuz see what brother Brian was telling us he said one fold open today or yesterday said one today and another one in an unknown language now watch he preached to us God in Christ but now at the seventh seal he gets a revelation that Christ the lamb and the Holy Ghost is the same person and where is that person act he goes to Christ the mystery of God and he preached Christ in the church Christ is the mystery of God revealed where in you Christ in the church he was waiting on a time he could preach Christ as a mystery of God reveal because he said now back up he says you're now the fullness of the Godhead bodily I don't think he could say that before he got a revelation when that seventh seal open that you are the fullness of the Godhead boggling which means not one person but collectively we make up the fullness of the Godhead bodily now Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden of Eden in the representation of Christ in this bride now this is my quote everybody look at me I don't have a quote for this to bite nothing up this is me okay that all right this is me when brother Brown saw the third part of that seventh seal open it was open in a mystery he said I couldn't read it it was in an unknown language right this is the way del Club it was me and you because he never seen any of you he never seen the body change come to fruition in a group of people so the third part of the seventh seal that he couldn't interpret is what he couldn't see he couldn't see Freda robbers chimdale richard roberts lewis you a go today he couldn't see that God didn't show him individuals he just knew a bride was gonna make it but it was in an unknown language because listen brother Brown knew a lot but there's a lot he didn't know remember brother Brown said God doesn't tell his prophets everything a man showing that when that third when that third part of that seventh seal opened it was in an unknown language and it never spoke of it again but he spoke up at all through the whole sermon that it was Christ in a group of people that he's not gonna know them individually because he's going on it's me and you because the you and I have got to be a part of this and for that third fold for the whole seventh seal to open you understand what I'm saying then if you can't say that then it's not open if all three folds don't open then the seven seals not open so all three has to open and he never spoke of he spoke of this he told us about Christ in the church and the kingdom coming Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden of Eden he didn't see you and I he didn't see Lula Church but he knew there was a somebody coming he just couldn't read it why would God show him that if he didn't want him to be a representation of something I'm just what I'm telling you that's just my viewpoint it may be the wrong as rain but let me read this next quote in the future home it will be paragraph 274 the future home 1964 brother branham said heavens and earth have met God and man is reconciled now who is that that's not all mankind that's the bride that has come to a Redemption of their body heaven and earth have met God and man is reconciled a restored Eden has begun see all the curse is gone now listen when you take a body change in this dimension in this church age in this time period all curses don't in you all curse is gone because what is the curse listen the curse has been lifted on your soul if you're born again the curse if you go through all this statue of a perfect man and you live close enough to God the curse is going away from your spirit because when you take a body change you got to deny you got to deny that you were born a human you were born to human but you got to deny because if you agree with that you're gonna die you've got to disagree with that and you know what I can stay here today and I can talk to you from now for another 15 or 20 minutes on this and it'll be in an unknown language if you don't get a revelation of your own self it will be gibberish it will be that third part of the seventh seal in an unknown language that nobody even the Prophet said he didn't know what it was it's a mystery of an individual coming to a body change that's just if I see if it's any other way I want somebody to tell me because let's read this last quote now we do have number 10 bring number 10 up and we'll be done and we'll get ready for communion sorry I've been letting this out an hour and 10 minutes I'm going hour 20 sorry number 10 listen live now watch this is still crossing mr. Gardner field this is the nth this is right what look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do what is the new birth then you'd say well brother branham what is in your birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you see not you joined the church you shook a hand you'd done something different you had a Creed you promised to live by code of rules how many times have we done that when we get in trouble hey man we're just human you know you sometimes it's not that you're repentant it's just you got caught that's why some people try to find Jesus in jail Hey they just got caught but not you and I listen when you and I have the new birth it's not getting caught no it's not getting caught no godly sorrow leads to repentance we don't live listen you're not gonna live by coda rule we don't we don't live by coda roof but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the revelation that the church was built upon not a Creed not a building but Christ in you so all God was he poured into Christ all Christ Porter in the church took her back to the Garden of Eden there's your three fold mystery of that seventh seal it's Christ the whole you hear that word Christ all God was reported to Christ oh Christ was your point in the church and you become Christ and takes you back to the Garden of Eden those remember God's not coming back after you he's coming back after himself it's okay if he comes back after himself and you have what balkanized are attached yourself to Christ then he's coming to get you - you're going with him hey ma'am with the three fold mystery brother Brown told us of the one he's revealing Christ the whole seven seals God in Christ reconciling the world to himself and then Christ in you the hope of glory what he preached in Christ the mystery of God revealed and that third part which was not revealed to him he said it was in a known language and he never spoke of it again I just believe folks that it's you and I we are the recipient of that mystery and what she's doing here somebody ought to bring that quote up one day really we have got to quit thinking that we're a separate person from Almighty God we gotta quit if we don't then it will be I'll be doing your funeral not your I know you are you feeling better see there told you you set up here where the fire falls man you get all that around here in that right I always thought you know let's stand to our feet wait I always thought if if you know if you had a church and usually everybody piles in the back I thought about having a church to where you you could take the pulpit and it was on a rail and you could stand here and then all of a sudden you could take that pulpit and run it back there to the back and turn them and make the seats turn around so that all the people in the back of being the front hmm fooling people but I believe the threefold mystery ends in you and me it doesn't end in brother Branham cuz he told us he saw something that he couldn't interpret so what couldn't he interpret he didn't see me in you lord I'm telling you I'm gonna make this statement and then gonna make it again all these people that won't brother branham to come back I don't I don't want him to come back not like they want him to come back he'd be so disappointed he would be like Jesus in the temple except it would like it a lot longer because he'd have to go around this country beating the devil out of people the way they've turned his message into what they've turned it into but thank God thank God we have got a revelation that is Christ in you not not what's going on up there above us that's what's going in on that church right over there but it's Christ in you what's going on in you is what's gonna take you out of here hey man what's going on in you and I is what's gonna take us out of here now we have to warn amen we have to warn about things that's going on but I'm telling you we will not take a body change because of what that church will be under did you're gonna take a body change by what's going on in your house in your life in what you're doing and the things that you see in the revelation I hope God gives you a wonderful revelation I don't I don't want to be listen I don't want to have that in an unknown language and stay in an unknown language I want it to be something I want it to be and if it's gonna be something that's going to be what Christ in you the hope of glory it's going to be that third part it's gonna take a body change and the dead of Christ gonna come out of the ground and guess what brother arms coming with them we're gonna be around here 30 40 days brother ray we're gonna be get to what we're gonna get to commune with those people I don't care if California falls off the face of the earth it will not harm me and a glorified body nothing will harm me so I'm not worried yes get body change let's get the resurrection let's get the body change and then it matter to me we could walk back in here at the Battle of Armageddon and we could have coffee and drink coffee and eat cake in the middle of that battle over there and it will not harm you that's what God's doing for us folks that's what God's already done for you we just got to realize that it's already here it's not a new book it's not a new tape it's not a new person it's not a new this it's not a new that it's what we already have make it make it known God making himself known in human flesh let's bow our heads Damle father lord we thank you for today we thank you for these people we've been with something for a long time Lord and we we see that Satan he's tried for a long time to try to separate us but lord I pray that we'd bind together properly God told us to bind together whatever we do just bind together in one and Lord if if it be your will father I pray that everybody in this building will when they walk out that door they'll have a supernatural charge anything going on in their life each person is an individual and there's individual things right now bothering every one of us because we're in this age that that's going to happen but father you told us to a prophet in the message countdown that you have pressurized you have saved us for the end you have pressurized this astronaut to leave this earth amen so I pray Lord that you would just bind us together clear all that junk out of our out of our mind and Lord and have our minds set on you Father because you sent your prophet and now it's left up to the people to believe what he's already said and make it live because that prophet preached Christ to us and now it's Christ in us as Paul said the hope of glory father give us this day our daily bread forgive us of our trespasses be with us Lord on the highways on the way home but before we leave Lord I pray that you would sanctify us for this communion that will take this communion with clear minds and clear hearts and that the things of the world would just pass away for a little while while we commune with you Lord and go through the foot Washington we pray that you just bless this time Lord forgive us of our sins in our many mistakes and our and our problems that we have against you Lord and just realize that as you being the center of the revelation the prophets said you have made us because you stood here one day and you said that that day you shall know it is I and you and you and me man what a revelation father give us this day our daily bread take care of each one that's sick here or we pray brother Colley brother dick for the Daugherty this Johnny the boys all the ones Lord it's got a an issue in their body I pray this you would just give them a supernatural charge Lord you you can change those atoms and reverse that process Lord of of that disease or anything that's going on Lord

done with the word and I pray this you just be with our pastor Lord keep him strong and healthy bless everyone that has anything to do to work Lord in the church we pray this you just be with them
