and and we believe in prayer CLA we believe in the power of God we believe it comes from the Bible we believe that Bible times are now and not back then it's the same God that was in Paul the same God's in me and you the same God in brother bandam the same God in brother Dale all right so we took the cloth off and we're going to preach over them and then we'll pray over them and then you come

here but uh if we don't the everybody's going to be scattered next weekend after the second service all right you can go downstairs and get a cold drink or something and go to the bathroom but we're going to have our meeting of the officers that we said we were going to have several months ago it's time for us to meet it will be and if you can't let me know all right brother Bob brother Louise brother Aaron Brother Dy Brother Gary brother Terrence brother Ryan Brother Anderson brother Joe Canada brother collie and brother Donnie that's our officers that we see at the moment and that's who we want to have a meeting with next Sunday afternoon after second service all right immediately following second service and we'll we won't be as long as the last one cuz we got some things done then so we're going to hone it down a little a little bit and get started on some things everybody just pray um that U the leadership of this church does the right thing all of us together and and that we are all on the same page we're all in the same ship we're not rowing in different directions all right and um it it makes for a good church makes for a good atmosphere to come and and preach in and a good atmosphere to Worship in amen just as a candle cannot burn Without fire man cannot live without a spiritual life what's a candle to do a candle is to be lit right that's what you use a candle for you light it that's what a spiritual life is for it's for you to light it and let it project and we're going to talk about that a little bit this this uh morning because we want to continue on this but we're going to talk about sanctification in the time of of uh John Wesley and then into our day that we're living in all right so if you got your Bibles you turn to the book of to the Book of Revelations 1 and we're like I said we're going to be a little slow if we have to continue this afternoon that'll be fine but I want the um visitors to to catch up a little bit and see kind of what we're talking about listen listen the Holy Ghost said he would lead you and guide you into all truth so believe in the Holy Ghost forget about the Devil he's going to be there all right he's there already talking to you you know so just let the Holy Ghost open the word up to you he's the only revealer of the word I can't do it these ministers can't do it but I promise you when we get to the end of this sermon you'll see why brother Bob did what he did today you'll see my brother klie read the same scripture I'm not going to read that scripture but you watch and see when we get to the very end what I'm going to speak about on sanctification it absolutely you could put all three of them together and it's just a symphony and we sure appreciate the Lord for that so let's bow our heads dear Lord Jesus thank you for this morning you've give us and for this group of people Lord the purchase of your blood and as the prophet was saying there he said oh give me a church full of the Holy Ghost give me a church that we can come in and and sit down and listen to you Lord and and have all the flu unstopped and and all the filters unplugged and we can hear Lord and we can react and say praise the Lord or glory to God or Hallelujah because it resonates inside of our soul there's something inside of us that's yearning for something besides this world and father I pray that you'd be with us now open the word to us Lord be with the ones that are here Lord that are visiting we pray that you'd bless them and and Lord I pray that you would touch each life that's we have many on vacation brother John durett just called there in Pigeon Forge brother Terrence and brother Zach they're over in Myrtle Beach and brother Ryan is in Kentucky so we have several people scattered around and I pray that you'd be with them Lord and bring them back safe father but the ones that are here Lord I pray that you would touch us father anoint us for the job that we have to do and the job is to preach and the job is to hear it's what the spirit says to the churches father just be with the ones that are sick we love you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1: 10 we've been on this for a while but I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega now remember that's the book ends that's the beginning Alpha and the ending Omega they're to be the same all right that's why there had to be a restoration between the two that was a falling away we'll get to it in a minute and then there's a restoration back to what to the full word of God in the end time all right so you're part of that you're the Omega bride all right you're the Omega bride you're the one that the whole thing is going to end up in Israel is waiting on you amen and me to fulfill our part as a gentile and then move on over to them all right so I say let's get going let's get it done and what thou seest right in the book and send it to the seven Church churches which are in Asia and that's the seven Church ages Ephesus SM these were real cities and the characteristics of these cities match what was in the Bible so it had to be a God thing it had to be God do it because he told then he told John to write it and send it to him send it to the church that was there don't send it to the city don't send it to the chief magistrate don't send it to the mayor right send it to the people that's going to listen to what's being said and I hope today we are the people that the Lord has give us an opportunity in this Omega age to learn and and to know where we're at and I know what we're doing here and to know why that we're here in the beginning why we're here to start with but write it to all these churches I'm not going to read them all we know we're in the lay ofy and age we are in that time slot but we've been caught out of the age every bride and every age has been caught up out of the age they get they do get the blessings but they do get the cursings all right and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks now we know that's the manora that's the seven candlesticks that are lit and we'll talk about that maybe this evening about the second the first Veil going into the holy place now not the holy of holies the holy of holies is the baptism of the Holy Ghost right but the holy place is the second one and that's sanctification okay now you ready and then the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about to B pap with a golden girdle so here is Jesus Christ standing there in Bride form being gir about here the paps covered breast which signifies female and that's the bride so it's Jesus Christ has what brothers he's in morphed and sisters imorph into me and you he's IM morphed into the bride I was reading brother Brown a day or two ago he said he said when she we said we always say oh she is him well do we really realize that that she is definitely him not a second person we got to see that you may be SE and I'll read the rest of this while you're sitting down I know you're tired but now we're on the Philadelphia and church Age and and for the sake of the brothers and sisters that that come in we'll we'll just kind of give an overview of what we've been speaking on but Revelations 3:7 says and the angel the Church of Philadelphia now remember there was an angel to every age right not three or four one God spoke to that person that PO that person grabbed the Revelation that was from God and he spoke it to the people he literally had the mind of God Amen if not he wouldn't wrote it in the Bible that's right these things sayith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy works like brother Bob was saying about Job God knew the whole deal about job before the foundation of the world but job didn't and I don't believe the devil knew what was going to happen at the end I don't believe he can see very far in the future if he does he'd be real scared but remember God doesn't give him Revelation he formulates his own whatever story cuz he's a liar everybody with me but he makes it so close till it sounds good look good Satan's seed is here it's not somewhere else we're you know if you're waiting for a pope to set over in Rome and become Satan incarnate you're fooled cuz you're not going to be here if you're a bride you're not going to be here let's get him out of this seat right here let's get him out of this part let's not let him be incarnate here that's right amen don't worry about over there well who's going to be the pope where you going to come from we know what brother R said about those things but remember we're gone yes so this irrelevant it's good to talk about but it's irrelevant that we're going to even see the guy become incarnate because you know what we're going to see the Incarnation of a bride of Jesus Christ he's going to be incarnated in a bride and that's what's going to bring the dead out of the ground that's what's going to bring the body change if when we see Christ already incarnate inside of me and you but we got to go through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the Holy Ghost himself the word of God coming and living inside of you not just anointing you you know I I know um most of you know what I'm talking about but but it's I won't call any names but we just went through a situation where a brother and sister of certain Church left the message and they're out doing just ungodly stuff but they cried when they sang they cried when you pray they cried when they hear the word of God they're so humble didn't have one o of the Holy Ghost in their soul or they wouldn't do what they were doing now I'm warning you I'm warning you just because you feel something just because you might have a little seniority over somebody else and you've been s in your favorite seat for 30 years if you ain't got the holy ghost in your soul you're lost period you are lost and you need the holy ghost in your soul Satan can anoint you every service he can anoint you absolutely he can anoint you somewhere else but as brother Bob and him are saying it's the life it's that consecration it's that it's that having Integrity yes to be able to whip the devil with that amen so just realize that I want you to realize that you see people and you see people like Tim Humes I'll call him brother preached 40 years huge church out denying the message now where was his holy ghost anointing it was on his Spirit realm or he would not turn the word down Abol the Holy Ghost can't turn the word down cuz that is the word of God and that's why you respond and say Amen sorry brother L I'm getting excited and he told me to kind of slow down a little bit so just okay I'll slow down brother God bless you at least at least they're honest if I get to going too fast go uh how you say inan espan slow down espan right slow down I'm learning I got one word for thou Hast a little little strength and Hast kept my word and Hast not denied my name behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee there's the mighty conqueror where's that Mighty conqueror though it's in those people in that Philadelphian age they conquered the world with the word of God they went it was an open door to all these different missionaries that Livingston and different ones that went out and and missionar the world and and got people to turn away from Satan and turn to God and they'll be there I think sometimes we think it's our forign no more no the world's going to be full when we get in that City the city's going to be full and that world's going to be full of Eternal people am and if you're an eternal person person and you're going to and you're living in eternity in heaven there's somewhere you got in contact with God here yes sir you oh what about well what about a cup of water in my name who' they give it to come on who did you get who did the water get brother Dy brother collie there's the connection you hold eternal life in your body today if you're bride yes and that cup of water is going to be to Jesus Christ not to these Brothers I just called their name no you giving it to him that's why we must give him our all that's why we're falling short of giving him our all come on somebody because thou H has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation what kept job from the hour of Temptation it sure wasn't his wife it sure wasn't his three best friends huh huh but when eliu showed up or that last one which portrayed Christ he said job stand up I'm fixing to tell you something that them other three has not told you on and then what did job do he got a revelation when Christ comes on the scene he clears everything up listen if somebody steps on a scene in your life and it causes confusion it is not God it is not God God is not the author author of confusion we may go through tough times we may go through ups and downs but but we still got God inside of us as brother Bob said it really everything that job went through was just part of his life right and that's what made job who he was that's why I said about a Christian a true Christian tragedy does not destroy you it compliments you actually it actually makes you stronger right right tragedy does not destroy if you fall apart and you quit church and you say God don't love me no more and the pastor hates me that ain't God that's the devil listen we have had I was I was preaching last Sunday we've had the seals opened yes but that thing now is closed inside of you the only thing you got to do is is let the part out that the people can see huh you got to keep that secret in your heart the problem with Satan was well I'm getting on a different subject here thank you brother Bob but the part that Satan couldn't stand was he couldn't get in job's Soul he couldn't get he could he could do everything around job but he didn't know what job was thinking in his soul now not just what concs in your head right it's what's down inside right that's still small voice oh oh thunder lightning blah blah blah but the still Small Voice is what we must Listen to We're going to have UPS we're going to have Downs we're going to have despair we're going to have good times and bad times but thank God the prophet said he said just because you got a cloudy day don't mean God hates you if you have a sunny day that he loves you listen God can't change his mind if he ever loved you in the beginning he can't unlove you that's why the tragedy in a Christian's life builds character and integrity and Satan don't know what to do with you when you go through that Satan does not have a clue what to do with you cuz he destroys people out there and he sees what they do they go to drugs alcohol XYZ right I'm going through a tough time we'll go to God that's what we as Christians do we go to God we don't hide under a well hide under your own chair your home you go to church I don't know where that come from but that didn't I didn't charge you anything for that all right so because thou has kept the word of my patience but listen this is an unsealing age yes it is cuz the seals are open but I read you that scripture and so did Brother collie read it amen grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed H so God puts it in there and he seals it back up where listen what did Brother Bram say he said if I tell it Satan can hear it now that's not a direct quote but that's close enough you'll find it he said but now if I keep it in my heart that's one thing Satan can't do folks to a Believer he cannot he cannot interpret what's in your all cuz he don't know do he know what to do with Jesus he did everything in the world and he didn't defeat him so where's that man at huh take your finger take your finger point hey point do this right here that's where Jesus is now right here he's not in heaven he's not over the sea he's not thee even in the heart heart heart soul not your everybody with me so that's the part Satan if you're born again that's why you have eternal life Satan can't get eternal life he's wanted it from the beginning that's why he's got such a chip on his shoulder against you and God he wanted eternal life he wanted to be able to create and he couldn't oh let me do no Satan just stay right oh no Lucifer stay right here that's why we need to stay in our position yes sir know your position stay in it and God's good with that brother R said direct quote there scrap peaps of ministers that goes out beyond the program of God and they r on side the road and that's what's happened to a lot of people but they ain't got a lot to do with the church age so let's just continue on here but here's the church ages and I hope you can see that but we went Paul irenius Martin Columba Luther we're now at John Wesley number six which is the Philadelphian age excuse me and remember the black of that is the Blackness of the age and then you see the white which is the holy ghost in the age are what the anointed word for their time amen everybody with me the anointed word for their time is the white amen okay it's the white this is the darkness of Satan this is false Doctrine right just like I said in in Tennessee I need to start preaching other places I get 50 views here when I preach and I got 200 and something when I preached up there so go figure and then if you put a real nice title on it like they did with Bobs he gets about 200 views too so it's ACC to what you do you know they going to look at me and say oh son of man number 185 okay we'll listen to that later but oh the one God in The Bride of Jesus Christ will listen to that one people are funny but anyway that's that's false Doctrine see how there's not much then it gets more more more a little bit less a little bit less and then remember in this age right here brother bram's the one that put that in there he said the last Church age was completely dark I put a little light in it which is who is that me and you it's me and you sir you know what that is right there that's Grace that's that God sent a prophet to be in you and that we accepted the message which is the true message which is the right message only only message thank you brother preach but remember all these we see the circles and we see what brother Ryan preach it all comes down to a woman right in the Garden of Eden the woman showed dominance over the man everybody with me all right and that's the way Satan got in and you know what that's the way he's going to carry his his all the way through he's going to get into church and be a dominating female and dominate any Doctrine as as somebody was speaking I guess with brother Bob about the dress of of our sisters that dominating spirit is so dominant to they don't want to be submissive anymore they don't want to wear the correct clothes anymore and don't tell them they need to wear the right clothes anymore don't tell me and that's what they did in the in the church ages man got behind the pull pit and said don't tell me XYZ whatever it is and that Doctrine formulated through the devil from a dominating Church female Church listen we are the Church of Jesus Christ but we are not dominating over our head we are under our headship which is Christ we are the Bride of Jesus Christ brother rown said we're not the church we're the bride and the bride that knows what she's doing is submissive to her mate she's submissive to her husband everybody with me okay so the dominating female or the church is where all the doctrines as we were talking about in Tennessee when when when we see the seals released it's always got to do with Doctrine it's always got to do with a message it's always got it comes from right here amen why did Brother random in marriage and divorce he didn't have to preach that sermon to tell us how to get married and how to get divorced the Bible tells us that all right is everybody with me he didn't have to do that it was already but it had been misinterpreted so many times yes sir so you can do this and you can do this and you can do this he said because he said we find ourself in this situation because of misinterpreted theology sir right here this is where theology comes from right and if we had a lot more neology we'd come back to theology that's wrong but he said because of that we're in this shape we're in but praise God about three sentences at the end of that service he said but I say to you he said don't do it no more go on as you are there's the grace there's the grace that we're looking for to know that God knew listen God knew we was going to get messed up up yes he did not brother Brown tell us that God knew if he put us in human flesh we would fall that's right and all that other stuff that goes with it so he used the fall still though by sex to get you here by permissive will absolutely right amen coming right back yes to the Garden of Eden the where we're supposed to be that's what we're doing we're eating our way back to that Garden listen God put the chasm there he's got to be the one that fills it in to get us back to that amen he said look right he said look he said he said I'm going to put a division or enmity between me and you you're not going to be able to talk to me anymore like you used to you're going to you're going to hear me through the teachings of this and the teaching of that teachings of Moses teachings of Abraham and all these different ones everybody with me amen but now there's a time right now though we've come back to this to where God is now speaking back again he's trying to get us cleaned up enough yes to talk to us everybody with me cuz God won't dwell in an unclean vessel that's right so the Earth opening of the first three seals loosed a Ministry there was a Ministry looed true and a Ministry loosed false amen cuz here stands a lamb with the book watch that book that book is eternal life that book is the Bible that book is truth and the man that wrote it had it in his hand and the man that possessed it had in his hand right but he said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes a white horse rider this ministry was loosed and so was that one cuz remember in every in every instance it's twins yes right every instance it's twins can and abble we proved that the other day Jesus and Judas and even right now you're going to have Christ and Antichrist right here in the end time one the epitomy of Christ the other the epitome of antichrist all right so it's coming to a head today yes sir yes amen open our eyes so the opening of the first three seals Loos the ministry so that Ministry was so strong though it was so powerful it was in the lion anointing l i o n the lion roared they had they didn't have a Baptist on every every corner or a Methodist or a Pentecostal or a bromite church on every corner they had the word of God they taught it right straight Jesus give it to them straight out of his mouth so guess what we're doing if that did it to them there it's going to do the same thing to me and you here that's why we had to have a prophet that was the mouthpiece of God that spoke to us by the word of God through the word of God With God telling them what to Happ and a lot of times it wasn't brother Brown speaking anyway but he promised he would restore and that's what we've been talking about from all the church ages back to here that there had to be a time that there was a group of people that had the pure word of God and then like I said before doctrines got loosed Ministries got Loos by the White Horse by the Red Horse by the by the Black Horse and by The Pale Horse there was Ministries Loos and and it remember it kept it started as a white righteous church so it what it would get the attention of the people oh it's white oh it seems right then what seemed Right started killing people right physically killing them then that Doctrine became incarnate in a pope and it started spiritually killing the people and that's what's happening now in this age they're spiritually dying because of false Doctrine that's right or the loosing of a Ministry that was not true but God promised praise God I will restore he didn't say you he said I'll restore he didn't say Satan's going to restore he said I will restore those years in other words I will pay those years back I will what redeem the time that all this got lost he's redeeming it now so the first three ages pure word of God the fourth Church age went into the ground remember it was just to be a Christian you were killed all right wasn't a whole lot of uh healings and and worldwide campaigns and not no you lived a Christian Life you were in that Ox age you B you you were a burden Bearer you just kept going and kept going and basically 68 million of them died amen so then the fourth Church age went in the ground as we were talking about but Jesus Promised here in in the Bible in John 12 he said Jesus answered and said the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified now remember who is the son of man God in human flesh everybody with me now according to a prophet and according to the different pieces in the Bible that same son of man is supposed to come back in the end time in a group of people yes sir now he promised it we didn't he promised it amen amen cuz remember Satan didn't know anything to do with Jesus he he he couldn't he couldn't stick his as brother B said he stuck the Stinger into his flesh and he died well the Stinger's gone now so Satan don't know how he didn't know how to deal with Jesus if he's still here again as the son of man that's why the ministry's got to be right that's why the doctrine's got to be right that's why everything's got to be online so Satan can't get his grubby hands on you and me and he won't when we take a body change when we take a body change he has not got any on you at all right now he has a hold on your flesh that's right cuz you are dying and he does have a hold partly on your brain because some of you are asleep not listening to what I'm saying and some some of you are cooking supper brother Brandon one time he he stopped he said he said now wait a minute sisters discernment he said wait a minute sisters I believe it spoken words R seed he said your beans won't burn I believe it spoke a word Original Seed he said all right now you your bean your your stuffer your food food won't burn now sister just hang on a minute he he picked that up cuz that's what you're thinking now you've got you know 75 80 people in here right now about 75 different maybe a few of y'all are paying attention but 75 you got all kind of different ideas going around the place well me too cuz I just had a thought right then wasn't good so very I saying to you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abide us alone God had to let that fourth age go in the ground and die to bring forth the true seed now not that they were false they were true seed but they had to go into the ground and die so the son of man can resurrect in the end time because remember who's he talking about he's talking about himself right here in this instant dual meaning now remember he talking about himself he's the corn of wheat that fell into the ground the son of man not the Son of God see Son of God can't die son of man this is God standing here in human flesh saying that the son of man is going to be glorified all right if he's going to be glorified who's he going to be glorified in you or a group of people coming that Satan don't know have anything to do with that's why he hates us he don't know what to do with us I say again if you got eternal life in your soul he listen he resided there one time sorry about that you were Satan's subject at one time you did what the devil wanted you to do he wanted you to do that's right well pray for me I was that way I'm just plain enough that I was lost and I was doing what lost things cuz you know what when you become a Christian you do Christian things so when you become stay lost you become you do lost things all right so now that we're all on the same level that corn of wheat Jesus Christ had to Die the son of man had to die but remember he resurrected yes that flesh that son of man but now remember he said look the world's not going to see me anymore all right see me right anymore but you'll see me yes sir cuz I'll be with you even in you yes sir what in you in your flesh till the end of the world and we're standing right here at the at the threshold look what's going on look what's going on in the world horrible horrible everywhere you look Hallelujah so except the corn of wheat fall on the ground and die that was those people in that fourth Church age they died by the million 68 million died during that time under rule of Christianity supposed to be now Untold billions as brother Brown said spiritually died because listen you can be sitting here today and be dead as a hammer oh yes sir you can sit here today and be Just As Dead As Dead can be amen but let's not be that way let's be alive you can only be alive in Christ you can't be alive in the devil you can't be alive in your own self you woohoo I'm alive no you're dead right as they say before they're fixing to take the people to the electric chair you're dead while you're walking dead man walking that's what we were but thank God Christ took our place sir he went in there and took our place for us he got executed for us to come back the seed that come the corn come back and not just coming back one he came back in multiple forms 120 3,000 hundreds of thousands millions of little jesuses that's what the word of God does we sit here at the end time now though we are coming to seed head time right you can't plant a stock you can't plant a leaf you can't plant a flower and it come up sure you can plant it it's not going to come up you can even plant PL hybrid seed in the ground and it might come up one time but it'll never reproduce itself that's what Satan's done he's planted a seed and planting that seed we're sitting here and serpent seed unless we're born again that's what brother random said born between Satan and Eve so that's where we were between Satan and Eve that kind of puts you in a precarious predicament but thank God for Grace thank God for the cross thank God for Calvary thank God for resurrection that corn came out of the ground and he said all power in heaven Earth been given unto me yes and I'm giving it to you go into the world come on preach the gospel baptize in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost my name he said praise God where was I so the fifth age was an age of reformation now remember that was Martin Luther he come out of the Catholic church but a lot of the Catholic Church came out with him there was still some Darkness there listen not in his soul though but it was so in his Spirit realm till he took some of that with him CU remember if you're born again like I said before if you're born again think about this your soul is perfect yes you can't put false Doctrine in your soul that's why we need to listen to our soul more than we listen to our spirit or listen to any other thing that's going on listen to that one inside of you and if that thing doesn't resonate with the word you got the wrong one you got the wrong person that's right Satan can't cast out Satan right everybody with me at fifth Church age it was a reforming age now what is a reformer a reformer is like somebody that's a drug addict that you take and put them in a reformed place or used to be when you were really bad they put you in a reformed school they tried to reform you they didn't try to change you yeah they tried to change you but they didn't try to change the right man you got to have a soul change to be different right soul change to be different like I said before you can be anointed on your spirit realm and still be black as sun in the inside somewhere that thing's going to pop his head up somewhere that something's going to happen in your life and you're going to go I may not have what I got what I thought I had we're going to get to that in just a few minutes then we'll we'll wait till the rest of it this afternoon because there's a lot here that I'm going to have to to uh cut out but now the sixth age is what we're talking about all right the first age was the sardian church age it was the age of justification everybody understand that justification chops off your your past sins it makes you just for the moment it makes you just for the moment all right chopped off your past sins and I was telling them in in Tennessee that most of y'all were there you know God created a place that he can't even go to did y'all think of that when I said that God created a place that he can't even go himself that's right he created a sea that's right he created a place in his mind come on that's so covered by the blood he can't go in there that's right remember the Bible says he put in the sea of God's forgetfulness and he'll never remember it again am so there's a place that you say my God can do everything there's one thing I know he can't do and praise God he can't accuse me of my past sins that ought to make you happy or either you hadn't been Justified yet that's right truly Justified truly not got caught or Found Jesus in jail but really find God and say God I'm done I'm finished I'm tired of being tired I'm tired of being a slave to the devil I want a new life well you don't get one right then folks I'm telling you cuz you're still rotten in sanctification you're still in that Spirit realm you have that same motivator that there has been before it's just that the you're God in some way I say in some way I know what way it's because of the sea of forgetfulness God forgets all that and where it used to be that you had your sins recorded and all were written down well all of a sudden you got a clean slate yes sir amen and brother B I'm going tell us that's where a lot of people get and they don't go no further amen the Baptist once saved always saved I believe that if you start acting like a Christian but if you get saved at 5 years old and you don't darken the door of a church for 45 or 50 years and you live like the devil no you're not going to heaven I believe once truly born again yes sir no doubt you'll never get unborn again how can you unbirth yourself naturally that's what Nicodemus he said do I have to go make myself a baby again and go back into you know reverse the process and go back into my mother's womb Jesus said Nicodemus you ought to know better but he didn't we know he didn't cuz what he was looking at the law he was looking at what the law said there was no redemption in the law that's why Paul said sure it's coming to that and they were redeemed when Christ died at Calvary but when you if you brother brandham said he said they put the sacrifice down they lay their hands on it if they were an adultery he said they got forgiven for the year past he said but they walked out with the same devil that they walked in with cuz the blood of bulls and goats only covers sin it didn't eradicate it but the blood of Jesus Christ it will eradicate your sins so justification is a one-step process to begin with we know there's other parts but to begin with by faith in what Christ did at the cross you got to believe that your sins are not marked somewhere the sins of your past nature it gone Romans 3:22 even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe there's no difference for all have sinned all right Paul what are you talking about for all everybody say all all have sinned those of you all that didn't you must not have sinned for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace and only through his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus not the law whom God has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare what we're declaring today he is righteous but now in turn him being righteous turned around and said so are you right that's right hu y'all don't believe that do you not believe that he said so are you he said Paul said you are the righteousness in Christ Jesus to declare his righteousness today when you sit here and say amen and you live a Christian Life you have declared his righteousness but it now becomes yours to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed now listen you can't come up today and be prayed for and say brother Wade I know I'm going to murder somebody tomorrow I want you to forgive me or I know I'm going to get mad at my boss I know that well probably you're right but I want to get forgiveness now you can't do that there is no there's nothing in there for that it's sins past that's right listen Grace is not what you're going to do it's not for what you're going to do it's for what you've already done all right everybody with me look through the forbearance of God is everybody with me today to declare now here's Paul to declare I say at this time his righteousness now watch that he might be just got to have one person that's just but he's the justifier of put your name in there which believeth in Jesus where is boasting then it is excluded by what law La of Works no but by the law of Faith therefore we conclude now here's Paul the great Paul he brings it all to one one one sentence therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law remember we went through that the law kills you because the law said you kill somebody we're going to kill you you have an adultery with my wife we're going to kill you you have this we're going to kill you everything was about kill killing well praise God there was a killing one time 2,000 years ago and he didn't have to take another one he's the only one and he's the one that died for me and you if we ever forget Calvary and forget what Jesus done for us God help us amen sometime we get so revelated in the message till we forget about Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the message his Redemption and his grace is what give us the opportunity to be here today amen right so now let's look for just a moment we'll get to sanctification this afternoon this is the you can't really see it but let me get to the next one I think you'll be able to see it can everybody see it okay better okay okay all right amen amen amen amen all right this is the world all right there's a gate somewhere there's a there's a gate you come in now look you walk into this court now you walk into this court that is a type of what justification everybody with me uh when it rains you get wet when it gets hot you get hot but in here is where you start sacrificing working your way to here right everybody with me this is where you're saying God chop off my past sins I want to put the lamb you lamb the Lamb of God on the Altar and say God I put my hands on you and I transfer everything I got on top of you cuz he said give it to me that's pretty powerful for one man to say give me your sins and there's Bill Seven 8 billion people in this world but if every person in this world like brother Dale said if every person in this world today declared and got the new birth God wouldn't be going wait a minute let sit down on this one no he'd be way be stronger that's what's going to be in that new city come on somebody that new city going to be nothing but Eternal people that's why it's going to be something you can't understand cuz we are not in it now all right so this is the outer court all right even they have a place I've been reading up on this and we may do it later on they have a place called The Women's court and it's a corner over here like this now that's in not this is one in the wilderness they took up and went but when they had Solomon's Temple it was a little different cuz it was in one place but don't worry about that but it is a part people can even this is called the court of the Gentiles Gentiles could walk in here right right all right so what am I saying justification it chops off your past sins but it doesn't do anything for the continuation of your life if you turn around and walk back out you're just as dead as you was when you walked in but if you continue walking I hope y get some of that brother you shout hard these people don't do that Hallelujah makes you happy doesn't it amen but the six Church age though we move up a little higher and we'll talk about it this afternoon it's called sanctification now what is sanctification sanctification is you've made it through here you've made it through this is the Laver and the ball and a sacrifice and you made it through there and you're heading in here now look once you start into here come on a lot of people can't go in there just a a common person can't walk in there and certain ones of this that's been defiled boy I read something I'm going to read it this afternoon and it always bothered me the same way like with brother brandham and even with the people with when Jesus was eating the corn remember he was eating the corn in the corners and the priest come out and said hey what are you doing all this he said did not even David eat the shoe bread that was separated for the priest you know the shoe Bread's in here and you know what I always thought I always thought I thought shoe bread was Mana it's not it ain't even close to Mana right it's something the preach well thank you brother you should have told me that a long time ago I'm sorry okay get with it brother I need help but the shoe bread was made by the priest made by human hands that's right but when you went into the holy of holies when we ever get there there was Mana in there that never that was L listen that Mana was made in God's Kitchen yes sir that Mana was produced by God himself and when he put it in there he put it in you cuz Mana is the top of the what Holy Ghost but when you get ready to walk into that next Veil and that Veil drops there's certain things in there we'll talk about this afternoon but I want to get to one thing as we start into sanctification you with me so the sixth age is the age that John Wesley how you want to say this moved up in God a little more right he was born again but there was things that he lacked remember the moravians and all the different ones that he that uh uh sometimes we think that sometimes we think that all these these Church age Messengers they just you know they're like no John Wesley didn't know he was not born again until he met somebody that was the moravians he met them and said I don't have what they got remember his brother Charles he come back and said hey Charles we ain't got one Charles you know he's a little bit ill child said brother you built your whole life on this and you're telling me you ain't born again he said that's exactly right that's what brother DS always said he said I pray that everybody in this building realizes they're not born again that God can do something to help you all right we'll get to this later on I want to get to something right here it was called love of the brethren we know all that has a little strength and it but it remember it was an unfulfilled age also because remember it was the outer Court inner Court you're not in the holy of holies yet but it is getting there is called the holy Place sanctification folks is called in your life the holy place is when you start learning to come to church you start learning to read your Bible you start learning the things about God and what he does in his ways and his attitude we're going to talk about that in just a second so John Wesley was the pastor or the messenger he died in 1791 so the church age continued on to 19 1906 and remember brother Joe's he's in the back but we were at that Methodist camp this weekend and and I showed him in the book cuz I'd read it before they have their own Himel methodists they have their own Himel and in the beginning of it it tells you exactly what to do step by step what songs to sing how to sing them sing them with Zeal it says I mean and Joe was over just taking pictures of it I said I told you it was in here tells you how to do everything why because that's why they're called methodists cuz it was a method of worship that that that even Martin Luther didn't do now Martin Luther tried to have worship Services apart from just somebody speaking in Latin and you listening to what he you can't understand what he says but then John Wesley comes out and says hey there's a method of worship here and you know what God was happy with that cuz even brother brandham Condor and Doctrine he said do this do this do this do this God don't change if he brought it to Martin Luther if he brought it to John Wesley he brought the same thing to brother Brown the only problem is they weren't prophets they CAU pieces of the mind of God right they didn't catch the whole Mind Of God listen when a man stands in a pull pit and he says let's go back into the back part of the mind of God yes that's a place the devil's never been John Wesley didn't get there Martin Luther didn't get there but brother Bram said let's he didn't say I he said let's go back what's he doing he's pulling us into it oh that was just for brother Brown no no no no no no that was for all of us he took us into the mind of God that's what the message is the message is a mind of God Amen everybody with me listen we'll get into sanctification this evening all right this afternoon if you don't come back you'll miss something well people want to know where God is he'll be here at 2 o' this afternoon the devil will too but greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in me all right now look Luther in the church age of bringing forth the bride seed was the same in spirit now watch but just one little grain of seed Luther stood out then what the two little shoots right justification by faith he was the very type of Hagar the stalk coming up Wesley was the type of Sarah the Philadelphia the age of love that brought forth the tassel that in Wesley's age there was more missionaries than any other age we've had the great missionary age of John Wesley but Pentecost represented Mary that's what we're going to get to there'll be a Pentecostal age after we get finished with this one this is the age of sanctification the one coming up is the age of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then what is the Lan age it's the age of the word of God coming back into Power the Omega Church coming back into Power it's matured so sanctification is what cleaned up and set assign for use or purpose all right everybody with me just for a minute we'll close remember the glass God picked the glass up he picked it up because he was justly gonna use it then it was really dirty so he started cleaning it out but remember justification is one act watch you hear one act oh I'm going to use that one act what's sanctification I got to open it I got to take it in the kitchen I got to put detergent in it and I got to scrub it out so it's a process all right sanctification is a process we're still going through it Paul said I Die daily so as a process sanctification means becoming more holy Through Time right like a child growing up into adulthood Christians become more Sanctified over time and that's the truth that's that's why this right here right it stages this means that Christians should expect to make progress hello grow and become more loving kind wake up because this is I'm talking to you yes more loving kind humble and self-controlled over their life Jesus said sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth now watch what brother R said my dear Methodist brother in Pilgrim Holiness and Nazarene the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from sanctification sanctification is the cleansing which is preparation of life that's right now not life preparation of life but when the Holy Ghost comes it is life preparation is cleaning the vessel the Holy Ghost is filling the vessel sanctification mean cleans and set aside for service the holy spirit is put into service you are the vessel that God's cleaned up how can I overcome brother R said look we notice when the unclean Spirit has gone from a man he walks in dry places that's exactly what the church has done Baptist Methodist those who believed in sanctification then Jesus said the unclean spirit that went out returns back to this church body huh and finds the house garnish swept clean living Pure Clean lives all right but then if that house isn't filled occupied then he comes in with seven other evil demons worse than he was and the last stage of this place is seven times worse as it was at the first they had been better to have stayed Lutheran than it would be to receive that light and fail to follow it I'm talking to you today so will the Pentecostal see you know what I mean the house is garnished returned back found the house not filled with the Holy Spirit now the state of the church is joined with the league of churches World Council of churches and it's a state now that connects it with Roman Catholicism and all the rest of it listen forget about this Trump Biden all this junk they're garbage they're all garbage you better watch Rome you better watch what the Catholic church is doing underneath you better wor what we ain't heard from Pope in a long time why he's formulating his plan and whoever's in the white house that's part of his plan you know why though that's part of God's plan though I put in Kings I take Kings out and now it's seven times worse than it was when it come out of Lutheranism that's where man takes it now real quick Christianity is not based on what people do to you think about that this is my last statement right here Christianity is not based on what people do to you and it's not based on a condition right everybody with me and right there is the first thing y'all going to say well they well they they what Christianity is not based on what they do to you hello you want me to prove it I'm going to prove it right here amen cuz I'm telling you we still got a lot of stuff we got to get rid of a lot of anger anxiety and all this stuff the way you treat people yes oh brother I've been this message 50 something years I I ain't got treat no people the way I you ain't born again you ain't got the love of God in you I'll promise you that cuz listen to what happened Jesus said this is not this is not a quote from the Prophet this is a quote from the prophet Jesus you have heard that it has been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy for all of you watching online pay attention but I say unto you love love your enemies if you look that word up love it's not filio Jesus is saying you've got to Agape your enemies oh but they well see that you ain't acting like a Christian yes sir bless them that curse you hm Hallelujah you're reading it do good to them that love you no do good to them that hate you I asked him up in Tennessee I said do you pray for your enemies they would but one person raised their hand I want to go ask today pray for them which despitefully use you right and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward do you have yeah oh they're my favorite I love them I I love I just love them I just love them I just love yeah right you let them cross you one time you'll make a list say that again a if you love them which love you what reward have you so you're going to get a reward for loving those that hate youen do not even the publicans do the same or the common people and if you salute your brethren only well I'm not going to speak to that one because he didn't speak to me and U brother Donnie wasn't here on Wednesday night and he didn't call me and tell me so I ain't shaking his hand after church I love you too but you wer here Wednesday night and if you salute your brother if you if you Salute Your Brethren only watch what are you more than others you're just common do not even the publicans do that be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect Luke 6 verse 27 but I say unto you listen listen how specific Jesus was I say un to you which here some of those people didn't hear they listen they heard words but they didn't hear love your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them this is Jesus talking so there's no interpretation to this okay it's just what he says amen bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and to him that smiteth the on One Cheek offer also the other we getting we getting down some stiff stuff here now and him that taketh away what you got just let him have it if he wants your cloak give him the coat I like what Dave Ramsey said one time he said don't ever let somebody borrow money from you he said he said if your kids borrow money from you he said Thanksgiving dinner don't taste as good when you're sting across with a man that you need to pay back if you're going to give it to somebody give it to them and not expect nothing in return you can't be well Jesus didn't say now you no he died for everybody give to every man that askest of theme him that taketh away thy Goods ask them not again oh I brother bar something a give it to back Jesus said just let him have it that's hard that's hard sometimes I need my hammer and all that other stuff that Josh took home where's Josh at hey Josh let your kids take home with you but I'm I'm just reading what Jesus said if you can interpret any different then let me know after the service and as you would that men should do to you do you also to them likewise yes sir for if you love them which love you what thank have ye yes for Sinners also love those that love them aren't we supposed to be Christians aren't we supposed to be above that yes aren't we supposed to be somebody that walks and talks different that somebody can see a difference sometimes we open our mouth and remove all doubt and if you do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye for Sinners also do even the same and if you lend to them which you hope to receive here's Israel here what thank have you for Sinners also lend to Sinners and receive as much again but love ye your enemies do good and lend hoping for nothing again see that goes against all of our character but I'm telling you this is what Jesus said to be a Christian you got to do this right here I'm not preaching the seals today I am preaching the seals today I'm unsealing some things that we need we need to work on hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and you shall be the children of the highest for he is kind even unto the he who Jesus Christ amen is kind unto the unthankful yes and to the evil I think we need to walk different I think the problem we all have is is we hold grudges we know more than the next person does and if you treat me wrong bless God I'm telling everybody about it and God will give you some lightning no you might be the one that gets the lightning watch this we'll close musicians come on y'all stand people go to church they'll shake your hand in church and laugh call you brother outside the church they'll pull a little business deal that wouldn't be just exactly straight for personal game I wouldn't say them people are here in the Tabernacle but I say there is there's things that people would do and they get different a least little thing will bring that old temper back again that selfishness open up an ear to hear some gossip or do something of that type that person has never entered in that person has ever entered into this pot in here he's talking about going into sanctification they're outside they're truly eating the same kind of Mana they've been brought into the camp and that's where in the camp in the field it's where the people got the Mana and they're in there and that Mana that they eat is the same Mana this man eats here everybody believe brother Brown was a prophet all right okay they both both have the same Pastor they both read the same Bible but one constantly stays true and humble and the other ones got his ups and downs are going like this in and out both of them eating the same Mana but one of them has entered in and the other one is still out I'm just telling you what brother Brown said both of them are believers unto listen to me unto eternal life but one is baptized with the Holy Spirit in the kingdom of God and the other one is outside eating the same Mana wow I've seen people that shouted that lived any kind of life I've seen people dance in the spirit up and down the Halls come back out live horrible I've seen both men and women do that I've seen men and women dance in the spirit speak in tongu shout had a temper like I don't know what there's something wrong and yet they enjoy the blessings of God they believe in it they have faith in it but it's only in the outer Court it never has come to the inner Court there never got from here look he said from here down here all right this is the outer Court inner Court holy of holies you're getting close you love the Lord amen I just want to admonish you we got to start living and and and living not saying well they did well they made a you know what gets me people people come in the post office and and and they'll do their job and we have a job to do because we get trained to do that certain job and somebody says you need to be retrained well if you work for the Post Office no so you don't know whether they need to be retrained or not hello that's the kind of attitude people have that's a bad attitude that's a horrible attitude and it needs to be dealt with and I'm dealing with it right now you need to be kind to your enemies people that hate you you don't speak evil against them

where you start over again justification sanctification B in the holy ghost in a higher order we need to be in that higher order all of us needs to be yes now remember in sanctification the unclean Spirit goes out of your soul and God comes in he seals it up but remember there's still unclean spirit in your spirit realm hello there's unclean spirit in your spirit realm that's what makes us act up if your soul is what's making you act up you have no God in there that's right amen be kind to people that's true sanctification is to know that you can pray for somebody that hates your guts easy to love somebody that loves you but pray for somebody that hates your guts Lord have you ever prayed for somebody that cut you off on the side on the road no usually it's this I'll get them on down the highway Lord they may be having a bad day Lord maybe they need salvation speak to those people does that not change your attitude instead of you getting off stewed about it because listen there's
