God is so good isn't he I just sorry he just keeps getting greater and greater glory and I know he never changes so I must be changing I believe his power is still the same yesterday today and forever he's still able to heal and save and deliver his power is still the same with us and that's what I want to talk about about today Let's uh let's go to the Lord in prayer before we read this scripture Lord God we thank you Lord for your presence this afternoon tonight thank you God for your grace to us Lord to open your word to us Lord and Lord we're reminded Lord that you know about 2 000 years ago you were put down in the grave and they had stuck you in the side and piercedured hands and your feet and Lord you laid in that grave but then couple days three days later you Rose in Victory and you carried forth the torch of freedom and liberty and Power and Lord there was a purpose to that Lord Jesus it wasn't just to be a story but Lord God you made a way you told your disciples you gave them that Great Commission to take this gospel all over the world and preach the power of a resurrected Christ and Lord Jesus I pray God tonight they will see that you're still the same you're still living among us today Lord God it's the same as you always were God granted Lord Jesus said we'll see you alive tonight visible Among Us Lord Jesus that's what we're looking for Lord God Open the Eyes of our hearts Lord Jesus to see you God I pray Lord that you'll help me to speak your word and close my mouth to my own opinion Lord Jesus but God I pray Lord let your grant us Lord Mercy Lord tonight did you come and visit us Lord Jesus because where would we be Lord without your presence without your anointing Lord Jesus without your power Among Us Lord Jesus God prove yourself among us tonight Lord I pray and we're looking we're looking and expecting Lord Jesus and we know that it's written in your word that you would appear to those who look to you who look for your appearing Lord Jesus God granted I pray Lord Jesus bless this service we ask bless the reading of your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ First Corinthians chapter 1 verse 18. for the preaching of the Cross is to then the parish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God and then let's read Romans from chapter one verse 16. excuse me a little bit my nose is starting to run foreign of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word I I believe that just reading the word you'll be blessed even if you don't understand it all fully you know something is strange happened yesterday we had a little that got me really thinking we had a a chicken thank you brother you bless your heart we had a chicken that had a little it had a little brood of eggs and it it hatched it only only one of them hatched and that little baby chicken was running around just peeping and everything and we went uh the little kids went out in the yard yesterday and come to find out that that Mama chicken and a lot of other chickens in the yard had turned on that little baby chicken and began to pick it to death and it broke couple of its toes and just in a horrible situation and a little Zoe ran out and rescued it and and she now sees this mama we're joking about but you know I I got to thinking about how a lot in the message a lot of people Believers will kind of they'll put their put their their their uh your their faith and their hope and somebody and expect them to to lead them on to the to the truth and to lead them on to the power of God and then it comes to turn out that that that that person that they put all their hopes on it turned against them now when you're talking about I want to talk take a little topic this morning about power when you're talking about power when you're talking about these these things these scriptures that we just read it's important to find somebody who knows what they're talking about because if you if you find somebody you know one time Jesus sat around maybe the little campfire outside with his disciples and he began to ask them and the acquire of them who knew what who he was who knew what they were talking about it as he went around the circle he he asked who do you say that I am and he he asked each disciple and turned and some said well some say this some say that and you know that's how many many Believers today are doing well some say that he was that some say this about God some say this about the message and don't really know have an absolute that they can turn to to know what the gospel is all about what what the power of the Gospel is about but you know then then Jesus turned to Peter and he found somebody that knew what they were talking about and Peter gave an answer he said I know that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God and I like that because he said he knew that God was the same yesterday today and forever he knew that he wasn't just somebody from a history book he knew that he was walking and living right among him today I believe I want to confess to you now that he is still walking and living among us today he's still walking in the candlesticks he's still walking he's alive and well and that's that's my declaration tonight is that the power of God is still living among us today able able to deliver us able to save us save us able to fill us with the Holy Ghost able to give us whatever things we have need of and maybe the question I want to ask is how do we get access to that power what is the way what is the path what is the formula to getting access to that power now you know there's a lot of emphasis today in in the world today on what on power it seems like everybody's after power and you look around you know that you ate my work there's all these different politics people are trying to amass different products projects under different people and trying to get influence and and uh you can take it on up the the political ladder on up to your local governor and your mayor and all up all the way and what they're trying to do is influence someone to their idea and that's the way power works because power is always something that changes it produces change you take something in one state and then put it in another you take electricity at the train I ride and you funnel that electricity through the wires and the train begins to move because power produces change you take you take somebody a political person of political power and they're changing your ideas based on their speech and they're trying to move somebody mood produce change from one place to another and that's what power does the ability to produce change and uh power I was thinking about uh the the ocean how power is like you can go down to the ocean and look at the a lot of many years uh in the past my family will uh my brother and my my dad and I will we'll all we would take kayaks down to the ocean and in the winter when nobody else is there when it's not polluted and uh and we'll take kayaks and put them in the ocean and and ride the waves and go out and my brother likes to go out and and do deep sea fishing he'll go out like a mile in his kayak or out where the Dolphins and things are and where you can't hardly see him but you get into that little kayak and get in the ocean and the waves begin to toss you to and fro and you realize that that ocean has some power and it can move you and toss you over and and uh turn you upside down and before you know it you're you're in a in a shape and but you know one thing about the ocean is there's natural power that should be respected and there's natural beauty in that thing and if you if you come out and you can just stand by the ocean and listen to the power of the waves and you begin to think about God and how how that he rolled off the worlds from his finger by the word of his mouth and he'd be he all these things he put in place and and you know what happens is that man comes in and they changes what God produced in his natural beauty in his natural estate and they come in and build up these great big Condominiums and and sports complexes and and uh entertainment things and they come in and pollute it with the uh you can't even go out with your eyes open anymore in the summertime that's the way that man takes the power of God and pollutes it and that's that's kind of what I'm getting at is how do we get access to God God's power how do we how do we take advantage what is how do we get in hooked into the conduit where we have access to God's power and it's not by man's ideas it's by by hearing to God's word by sticking to God's word now let me let's Circle back around this little verse we read in Romans 1 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek it doesn't matter whether you have a historical claim of as a Jew or whether you're one of these heathens that came up with all of the this Pantheon of different gods and just a Pagan religion it doesn't matter if you have the revelation of the access to the power of God you can take advantage of this and now I I want to kind of ask if you knew down all through the the the history of the Church of the Bible men were looking for the secret to the access to to the way to access the power of God and if you knew how to do that would you want to keep it a secret would you want to reserve it for yourself why you'd want to you don't want to tell the world you'd want to you want to advertise it to the world you wouldn't be ashamed of it and I I find many today seem like there I was talking privately to a few uh different people and one one person told me they they while they wouldn't want you know the the world to find out that what they believed because then what if things went wrong didn't they'd show up on their doorstep and and start hunting them down and I'm trying to speak in a clouded way so you wouldn't be able to find out who that was but you know afraid afraid that people would find out where what kind of gospel they believe and I believe maybe that they they don't understand the power of the gospel because the gospel is not just about do's and don'ts but the gospel is about the power of a living Christ Living inside of you walking and giving you power to overcome the things of the world it's not about legalism and Colossians 2 chapter chapter 2 20 verse 20-23 Paul said wherefore if ye be dead with Christ through the rudiments of the world why is there living in the world are you subject to ordinances touch not taste not handle not which all are to perish whether using after the Commandments and doctrines of men which things have indeed a show of wisdom and will worship and humility and nicolating of the body not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh now that's your little scripture on legalism because if you if you try to do it right you try to have an hour show you try to impress your neighbor with how Pious and everything you are then that that's all well and good it appears great but it doesn't do anything to satisfy the flesh you still you're still going to have problems and and things but what I'm talking about is a power that can deliver you from the desire of the things of this world the power that can deliver you from the desire of alcohol drugs uh pornography whatever all these things that make you walk a holy life and be a holy vessel before the Lord God this is a power that that it seems like uh many people today have begun to deny that the power of God is still present because if you say that you've got to buy legalism God to strive every day to to to to to to walk a holy life that that is your Holiness by you know getting rid of a Christmas tree or you know I don't want to step on any Toes or anything but by trying to do those things instead of the spirit of God living you and change you by his power that's the power that I'm speaking of now let me let me uh to to talk about this a little bit more let's go over to Acts chapter four I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ Acts chapter 4 is what happened after the what was described after uh the Peter and John went into the temple and and walked up to the lame man and said we don't have any silver or gold but what we do have what we do have is power with God we'll give that to you and they said rise up and walk in the name of the Lord and so after that then they began to be chapter Acts chapter 4 verse 1 as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees Came Upon them being grieved that they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead because now when people see that Christ is made and manifest and is visible then it it makes him rile up and makes him mad and you know that shouldn't be unexpected it should be expected that there will be a little a little Grievous and they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the next day for it was now Eventide it seems like when you have power a lot of things looking back through scripture things are almost flip-flopped and it seems like you know when Jesus most powerful hour because he said I have power to lay my life down and I have power to raise it up again he was in control the whole time he was in total control it looked like that the power had been taken away from him but he was he was in control the whole time at that most that it seemed like that critical hour he was maybe more power than than his whole Ministry and they laid hands on them and put them in hold under the next day for it was now even tied I'll be at many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand and it came to pass on the mara did their rulers and scribes and annists the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander And as many as were of the Kindred of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what by what name have you done this how have you done this did you do it by your own power and that's what uh and then really in in many in the denominational circles is what what what's happening is they're trying to accrue to themselves power and they do it just the same way that Balaam did by trying to convert people to his own way of thinking and instead of building create taking people to the power of the Living God they're taking people to the power of their own ideas and their own thoughts they have a power a power of a church a little power but that's not the power that's what I I want to take you to is is the power of Christ and then it's the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander And as many as were the Kinder the high priest will gather together at Jerusalem when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power by what name have you done this then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them you rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the infinite Man by what means he has made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom he crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him does this man stand here before you whole now Peter wasn't afraid to tell it like it was he wasn't afraid even though he was in danger being thrown into jail you know I say this because there are many people many ministers today believe it or not who are afraid of being thrown into jail who are afraid of being found out because of the Gospel that they Proclaim to preach the gospel is not just do this and do that that's not that's there's no power in that but there's a power in the gospel that will cause you that will make you as a second Peter where we're talking about the Statue of the perfect man it will make you conform to that make these these virtues rebirth into you it will make you grow into the stature into the fullness of a of a perfect man and he said uh be it known unto you all he wasn't afraid to tell the whole world this is the stone which was said it in all of you Builders which has become the head of the corner neither is their salvation and any other for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved now there's an answer there's a good answer for those that say the name of of God is Yahweh or Jehovah's Witness or whatever there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved and he said he did this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you can't say it's just in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not just tacking that on to the end of your prayer but that's a personal experience what God is living inside of you and then you can say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ anybody can tack that on to the end of their prayer but if you have a personal revelation of who he is and the power of the Living God that he's still living and working among his people then that's the power asking it in his name did you know that brother Branham even said when you ask the blessing of your food he said the way he said it he said I bless this food in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bless it because God if God is living in you don't you have power power to bless your food power to power to to bless your children power to pray a prayer of faith and and see the the sick be healed let me testify real quick because that yesterday he he fell and and uh and and twisted his ankle all up and he we were wondering that we might not be able to go to the the thing tomorrow up there and and I I had I was able to work from home today which is why I was here early so I I spent a little bit of time in prayer early this morning and I was praying for him and I come down later and he said I my foot's completely better and it's all better and I believe in the power of prayer and the power of a living God and and that's really what I know this is a simple message but that's what I want to convince you of because the there are many today and maybe many today in this church who who knows I don't know I'm just preaching I'm just casting in that are not convinced of the power of the Living God and I want to I want to talk today about what is limiting our access to the power of God because something's limiting so you know if you those electric wires that power the subway you you know you can't I think brother Aaron and I were talking about it the other day where I was listening to him talk to Zach about how you can expand an electric conduit and it just it'll funnel more electricity more power and so I I won't I and I believe you want to your desire is to be able to have more power from God more power in your life to to uh to walk closer to him to talk close talk with him to interact with him and and you know one day the power if we'll keep following the guidelines and following the prescription one day the power of God will become so real to us that it'll fill every fiber of our being and take us off the Earth and I've often wondered that because you know sometimes in prayer I've I've felt like every fiber of my being was filled with the Holy Ghost with the power of God but one day I still haven't been changed yet but one day it's going to be changed I'm going to be changed to be like him in my flesh because job said in my flesh I said see God now you know another little thing I just I I kind of I kind of I'm taking a little tack of attacking some of the things that I keep hearing because you know I I I was talking to somebody the other day and they said that they were got a great blessing from talking to somebody just an older brother that had been in the meetings of things and he said he made this statement and I'm not in danger of anybody over here in this because this is somebody a long way away and probably wouldn't listen in or whatever but you know if they do it's the truth sometimes the truth hurts if it's the truth but but they said I'll never understand what brother Branham said maybe or they said maybe I don't understand what brother branham's saying but you'll never take away from me that brother Brandon was a prophet now that seems like a real good a real good statement it seems like a you know just on the on the surface just you they're smiling and that's the way it seems like many preachers today I'm going to mention Facebook here so don't don't hurt me but I saw last week on Facebook brother you name James last time so I'm gonna name him names Jeff Jenkins his brother said the last for the last year Jeff Jenkins has been preaching nothing but psychology and and he was pointing fingers at the message Minister saying y'all didn't realize that he was preaching nothing but psychology well that that's what I'm talking about this you can come and and just present a simper and smile and and present well I I don't understand what brother Brandon said I don't understand the things that he taught but I know he was a prophet and that sounds real good but that doesn't provide a conduit to the power of God you got to know that the with the spirit Holy Spirit comes he would bring your remembrance things that are written in the word and show you things to come he'll open up the word to you and I believe today we should be far beyond just saying well I'm I'm part of the assembly I'm part I'm part of the people that say that brother Brandon was a prophet we should be Way Beyond that or if you're at the place where you don't really know whether uh whether brother Branham was you know well you know what what's water what's who's who or anything that that then come on there is a power of God waiting for you to attach on to it and partaking that and there was power and brother Reynolds life you know he he you know I think maybe sometimes we kind of get caught in that many people get called it just we're looking so much at what brother Branham did I heard somebody talk about how that they they were there when they when he they they stood beside him one day when they said can I can I uh let me show you have you ever seen the gift in my hand and he took their hand and put his hand on it and they saw the bumps raise up but you know that power in his life was to make visible to you so that you could believe that the power of God could be in your life maybe not that same way now that's not in that same way where you don't have a gift where it can show up in your hand and you don't have a gift of discernment but the power of God can be so present in your life that you can believe for healing and you can believe that your family can be saved and you can believe it if if God gave you the holy ghost that same Holy Ghost is there to to make all these other promises Manifest this the God is still the same yesterday today and forever and we're not we're not looking for a a gospel of sweetness and humility but we're looking for a God where we almost act like we're on a children's show we're just smiling and simpering and acting acting real chipper and everything but we're acting for a we're looking for a Gospel of Truth and power where the truth is presented maybe sometimes in a hurtful way that's uh what I I was listening sometime recently to brother Branham preached to the Full Gospel businessman and my goodness some of the times he preached to them he just laid it down he said he was getting on them about uh I think it was a singer or something if I remember right he was sometimes y'all get somebody in here that and he just laid it down the line and Mike and you know to think that sometimes he was preaching to those people when the only person that wanted him there was the one that invited him and I don't remember all the details about how how he got invited and everything but just to think about how he presented that gospel and those meetings where nobody wanted him to be there it should be expected that if we demonstrate the gospel and the power and demonstration of the spirit that people will come against us people won't like it because the devil will you know brother Brandon said God allowed the evil spirit to come on Saul to hate David my to make manifest what he believed the power of God in David's life you know I I sometimes I believe it it can really strengthen a Believer to look when somebody when you're claiming the god that God is still alive and well and you're claiming that he's the same yesterday today and forever and people rise up and say Well it can't be done there's no way for you to be healed there's no way for you to get this thing to happen many times in my life I've heard that and you know what I do I run a tattletail yeah yeah I go down that get on my knees and say father God did you hear what they said oh my I think that just really strength that can strengthen your faith of a Believer because you if you know that God is still able that he's alive and well he's able to bring his word to pass and you can stand on it and believe and trust him and the all the world says it's not possible you still stand on it and trust it and and you watch the whole conduit open to the power of God and watch his power work through you that's what I believe now now look look at the difference though there's the power of man and the power of God and see how you know remember Simon the Sorcerer in the in the in the in the book of Acts he he was trying to accrue Power by trying to pull men to his to his Doctrine to his gospel and he told Peter give me also this power when he saw what they were doing that they lay their hands on the uh unbelievers and and things were done give me holy also this power that on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost now what he was after was not taking people to the source of the power but he was after taking people to his own to his own Doctrine oh my that's why it's so important that when you're after the power of God to find somebody who knows what they're talking about that know that has been in touch with God it has a personal relationship and it's not just talking about just kind of some things that they mud up and made up in their mind or turn it into a psychology turning it into something like well I don't know whether brother Branham was right when he talked about the the Daniel 70 weeks or I don't know if he was right about this and that but I I believe that that through the power of God he has made a way for us to know he has made a way for us to be sure that what we believe is the truth he has made a way for us to be absolutely steadfast with with this message and the opposite now the opposite of Simon the Sorcerer now was Peter standing there who had been in touch with the source of the power and he said you know they told Simon the Sorcerer they when it went before he got in touch with with Peter and everybody they said this man is the great power of God this man I I think he's I think he's got something through his through his uh things that he was he was doing and his uh little tricks that he played and different things and but we're interested in the real power from God power from God so how do we get it how do we get God's power how do we get access to the power of God right now think about that the ocean rolling rolling waves of the ocean and there was remember that little story of the little boy in Holland you know I I believe that I'm correcting my facts that Holland is completely surrounded by the ocean and over time the land is sunk and sunk until they had to build these Dice and there was a little boy that the crack developed in one of the dikes and he stuck his finger in it to keep the the power of the ocean from flooding in but now in our case in my case I want the power of God to float in I want the power that's behind that dike to flooding and and just overtake my being that's got to happen one day it's got to happen to take you if you want to do something sometimes my wife and I will get every once in a while we we took we took the table and just put in third pool and went through all the quotes my we just about had a Revival if you want to put in uh uh it just slipped my mind what I was going to say well maybe I shouldn't went well that's let's just go on but um anyway that's a good thing to do sometimes is to put in yeah it's made it made it available for us that we've got all the messages at our fingertips I believe we should take advantage of that and sometimes you can have if you just kind of uh maybe you don't even have to have an emotional sometimes just kind of pull up the quotes and just go through them let's see what brother Brandon said about this I wonder what he said about the power of God and and just put in something that you find interesting maybe find out what brother Branham had to say for and you might be surprised it might be a little different than what you thought before I've had that own experience myself many times but but to to get access to that power of God there's got to be something to free up to free up that hole that the little boy had his hand plugged in just to make an illustration something to there's got to be something blocking us keeping us from getting access to the power of God and I want that whole the whole force of the ocean of God the whole force of it ocean of God's love to just flood in and take everything over but now what's stopping that is I believe is our unbelief and I've got some quotes here that I'll read in a little bit but now you know brother random talked about in in the greatest battle ever fought and many messages about how that your your flus are stopped up hey you know what your flus are is you remember something some preacher said and you remember something you did bad years ago you imagined in your in your mind that something should be some way or you imagine that the preacher don't like you or you imagine that somebody didn't shake your hand so they don't like you very much and you know it just blocks off that Dyke and the power of God can't rush through because there's something in the way and you've got to get those things free you know one of the other flu is your reason you got you got your own idea about how everything should work my goodness isn't that a big that's that's a huge thing just the reasoning that we should keep the message a secret isn't that something now reasoning that that you know there's some people out there that aren't predestinated here it's the way they talk and therefore we should keep it a secret I I remember my dad years ago talking about when he came into the message he was walking down the street with his brother and he saw somebody on the other side of the road and the brother didn't say hello to him and he said well why didn't you speak my dad said why didn't you speak to that to that brother and he said oh well he ain't a believer I'm not going to talk to somebody like that it just you know you got these flues blocked up if I was a reasoning in your mind and you you don't want to if you let the power of God come in and let God reveal it to you it'll blast that flu out and the power of God can just rush right in and take the place over and that's that's what I believe we're all struggling for and we're struggling through this life we're struggling as well we come to church we're coming to church and we pray and we read our Bible so that God can blast out the flus so he can fill us up and take us over take over our beat does that do you understand oh God I want you to understand he's trying to he's trying to fill us up with his goodness that's that the sister Shepherd's dream the holy spirit is washing everything out all the all the stuff all the flus everything just wash it all out until there's nothing left but his goodness that's that's what I want your Consciousness and your affection God through the power of His word can change your affection from the thing the affection of the things of this world to the things of God change your habits change your thoughts change the whole thing change your reads and get change your cautious change your imagination he'll change it all to conform to the word he does it by the revealing of the word he does it by the opening of the word and that's what now I'm going to change the direction here a little bit because that's what I believe in the Old Testament that God all down through the Old Testament and the new that God was looking for somebody through who he can open a conduit to reveal his word you know God is we're talking about revealing of the word we're talking about understanding and how you should find somebody that can open it to you because God the way he reveals it is through understanding is very important because he he does it through communicate communication is so important to God that he he wants it to convey to us what's written in his word and communicated to us is so important that in John it says in the beginning was the word because he's expressing himself he wants to express himself so that we'll catch the vision and the power of God that that the spirit can come and Quicken the vision Quicken the mechanics and make bring it to life and cause the power of God to be made manifest in US uh I believe understanding is so important you know that's one question I I I every time I finish preaching I like to go home and ask my wife because I think she's maybe one of the hold on now she's one of the few people that will answer this question accurately did you understand what I said now I'm not asking I'm not asking my wife did I preach the truth I might ask brother Wayne brother Dale their opinion for that obviously but now I want to know did you understand it because if you don't understand it then how can it be quickened and I believe that the Holy Spirit can come in quickening to us but you know there there should be even even you know the first time I read the seals and and things I thought I understood it and it keeps it just keeps magnifying and magnifying it if you're if you're at a place where you just it's just completely lost to you then just hold on and keep studying and keep keep reading and and after a while it'll begin to everything will begin to click and just keep rolling on but now God wants God is searching and I believe he's searching over this congregation tonight to find somebody through who he can unveil himself reveal his power in you that's that's his great plan and purpose in him Christ The Mystery of God revealed revealed in US Colossians 1 26 27. so now let me go over to first Samuel I'm just kind of going to flip through this y'all can fall on if you want but I'm going to kind of read some of these scriptures because at first Samuel chapter 15. we'll find out that a man named Saul King Saul failed at the task he had been given and why did he fail now the whole point the whole with all the way to get in touch with God the way to get hooked into God Is by Revelation when God reveals something to you well even if it's not revealed if God says something if God says something in his word then you have to do it you have to stay perfectly lined up with that word you know Cain Abel we say Abel had a revelation McCain knew after just observing just sitting around and watching he saw the Firefall and consume able sacrifice well then it was plain as day what needed to be done and as plain as day even without a revelation you can you can just kind of observe what people do and see how people are coming into fellowship with God you can just observe why won't you come down I remember Charles Perkins talked about this man in his congregation that he tried to get to see that he needed to be baptized and he told him over and over you need to be baptized and come to the Lord and finally he said I see that I need to be baptized and Charles Persian said well when would you like to do it he well and he kept delaying and he kept delaying and he would not do it now that's a dangerous place to be when you see that you need to do something but yet you won't do it it's one thing to not understand but when you have a revelation when you see it it won't do it now that was Kane's problem is he saw what to do and would not do it and now I mean came but now Saul also is what we're looking at here Saul was told by the prophet of God exactly what to do to go swap out all the amalekais go kill everything they had to just destroy it all but he said well I got a better way of doing it and the way that seemeth right to a man is a way of Destruction a lot of times and Saul failed to stay perfectly in line with God's word and because he did that he closed up the conduit of God's power in his life he could have been a great king maybe he could have been somebody that that maybe the songs and things that were sung about David would have been sung about Saul if he would have just stayed with God's word but he failed to do that and so the Gate of God's blessings was closed because it says you know the the Holy Spirit the spirit went from Saul to David and and so so in in first Samuel chapter 15 we read about how the whole story of how Samuel came to him and said obedience is better than sacrifice and and what's this bleeding of the sheep in my ears and the lowering of the oxygen which I hear what's what what's going on and maybe we could say that today about some things that are going on in the message what's this bleeding of the sheep the bleeding of the sheep that I hear that the people that that thought they could go run under the wings of their their Pastor or whatever now the pastor's turning on them and things what's this bleeding of the sheep you're done exactly what shouldn't have been done exactly what God exactly against the scripture and so the conduit of God's power has been closed but now how is it open and I believe that God was searching and the way he searches because God told first Samuel that the way he chose a king was by looking at the heart because it says he said I'm not he told Samuel I'm not like men I'm not like just you're you know anybody else and I don't just look at the outside appearance I don't look at your uh the smiling like you're on a children's show like I was talking about just acting real chipper and and appearances can be so deceiving and that's why let me just throw this out all the young people before you choose a husband or a wife you better make sure that you pray because appearances can be so deceiving it look it'll look fine on the outside but then after you've been married six months or a year and all of a sudden then that thing that's on the inside comes out and I heard somebody say that you know if you marry somebody that's not filled with the Holy Ghost then the devil is your father-in-law and that's uh I I believe many should prayerfully consider that most important decision in your life because it can have an impact yeah and not just that but you know appearances appearance of of ministers in the messages what church you go to the parents and it just I'm going to be honest it Grieves me a lot of times to see what people are attracted to attracted to simpering and smiling and cheerfulness and and more attracted to the songs that are sung the the way that the song Services held and led then the preaching behind the pulpit because I'm gonna tell you that the way to open up the conduit to God is Not By the songs or the the uh the The Smiling preacher but it's through the truth being preached and it being revealed to you and you taking that Revelation and running with it that is what opens up the power of God to you so God was looking for somebody to make himself manifest in make looking for somebody that he can make his power manifest in and you know brother Brandon said about this uh this about David before Samuel even came to him that David already had a relationship with God he knew who he was serving he knew about God and he began all these songs and things that were written about David uh I had I had some things written but I can't find them so I'm gonna just go on but Saul failed because of unbelief and look where so look where Samuel let's read and uh chapter 16. verse 12 and he sent see Samuel this is what I love God is so uh past finding out in the normal way of looking at things the normal way you would be to let's find the greatest the tallest statute person the the biggest the finest looking gentleman and and we'll make him the king which is what Israel was looking for but God doesn't do things the way we do and that's something that we should all consider before making decisions is God might want you to have this other job over here that didn't look right uh it doesn't seem maybe to pay the most money or whatever he might want you to marry the girl that looks a little bit more homely than some that's that's the truth it's the truth because God wants you to be happy and to be happy he's looking on the inside at somebody that there's a beauty that's more the beauty on the inside that's greater than anything on the outside that's that's the gospel truth that's what I'm telling you is the truth I believe it and he sent and brought him in now so they Samuel was confused about who he should anointed be king and all the seven paraded in front of him and he looked at each one and this isn't it because Samuel was waiting on the Lord to tell him who should be anointed king and and he brought in a little tiny fella you know what brother Randolph said that Jesus was small like five foot six or so or a short little fella and David was short and look at all these Great Mighty Men in the Bible who are not great in stature not big like Samson who the movies portray as being this great Hulk there's a we always laugh at this calendar in the back who's got Sam some pictures like this great big huge bulgy muscles but brother random said he wasn't like that at all thank God for a prophet to tell us these things so that we'll know we can understand God's design and how God works and begin to see how the the the continuity of the scriptures was put together that God could take a little shrimp and make them into a great big powerful man that could take a general ball of a donkey and kill a thousand Philistines he can take a little David and and uh somebody that's just a little scrawny runt and do Great and Mighty works and so they write songs about it and you know you can look back at and the history of the people in the Bible and see see how they're typing Christ and see how they're living the word now and this is in the Old Testament without the baptism the Holy Ghost what should we be today we should be so full of the power oh my I I got some quotes that I think will really bless you in a minute that we'll look at that just a little so say God showed same of this little this little runt of a fella and said this is him this is the one that I want you to anoint and so the then Samo took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went went to Rama so God was looking for someone that could that he could release the power of God into and now Samuel had a revelation of who that man should be exactly Samuel the messenger had a revelation but you know what David needed a revelation too and you know I believe when David got that Revelation that the power of God began to flow through him because when David realized that he was going to be king and he wasn't king yet that my he could do you know he made this confession he made it he told Saul when he met him he said there was a line came through and a bear came through but it didn't matter the lion came through and he took took hold of one of the sheep and and took him in his mouth but I went and grabbed it and grabbed it by the beard my you know we were talking to Brother Anderson about how the in the Africa today they as a riot of Passage a lot of these young men will have to or they used to I don't know if they still do but they used to take a spear and have to go kill a lion that's with a spear yeah but now David got face to face with it and grabbed it by the beard because he knew he had a revelation that God was with him that the power of God was with him and upon him that he was anointed to fulfill a purpose for his life and you know brother Brandon said when the bride begins to realize who she is and what she's here for she will be an invincible Army now see how important Revelation is so that Revelation opens up the conduit for God to begin working through you because when there's something holding back to Dyke then at the little Holland diet we're talking about then that power of God can't can't get it all the way in there's there's little things in your life that little things but but when David realized who he was and what God was doing boom just the power of God just rush in what could prevent it then when God when David believed God's word he believed what Samuel had prophesied over him he believed that he would come to pass you know David was anointed three times he's anointed once by same you know he was anointed once by the men of Judah the following and he was anointed once by the the whole country and just like you know one day you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you get another fulfilling When You Reach adoption but then one day a super knowing is going to come and take us in the Rapture it's going to fill every fiber of our being and take us into Rapture a shout voice Trump all the uh it's just beautiful the continuity of the scripture we could see how everything just fits perfectly together yeah now but now David just trusted the Lord and here's that here's that little scripture I was looking for he wrote this uh this song truly my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved you think about all the things that David endured in life as he was walking up that hill or rejected King and being sped on and things talking about and but he had a song in his heart and you know right after he was chosen what did he do right after he was anointed what did he do he was sent down to Saul and he began to cast out devils he played on his heart he played on his harp and you know I I was reading about somebody that was that kind of described it this way that how did David play his heart now you could play uh you just he played he he instead of playing his own song somebody said it just kind of poetic like that he was playing the harp song about how it was cut down and and turned into this harp and when he began to play the harp song instead of his song then it caused this evil spirit to leave David it's just kind of a little poetic thing that you know that's kind of how you know when you preach I could tell my own message but I'd rather Play Jesus song I'd rather tell about how he tells sing his message as a way to say it but now David said this song he only is my rock and my salvation and you know what brother Branham said about my rock my rock is rock is revelation and David had a revelation and God knew I believe that God knew that he would receive the revelation of who he was and what his purpose in life was and would obey it to the letter and keep it and that is why he was selected he said David is a man after my own heart and I believe that we all want to be after God's Own Heart and the way to be after God's Own Heart Is to take him at his word and stay right with it if you don't understand it stay with it anyhow until you do understand it because that is how you open up the conduit to the power of God open up the Gateway and so David's saying the song not a loving kindness is better than life that we know brother Brandon preached about and he had something after he was he had gone through these trials of life after he had an experience with God he could go down to Saul and play on the heart because he had something to sing about he had his own song he had a song in his heart he had something and I believe the power of God could put a fire in your belly a spring in your step and a song in your heart and it just makes you live a life it's more joyous than anything we should be the most happiest the most joyful people that should be a song with everybody's heart because of the joy of the Lord the sinners and but that song in his heart made him an outcast now the next little thing I want to talk about is isn't Davis that next little piece in David during in David's Journey and the next little piece is when he went up to Saul and he made this confession that I've killed The Lion and the Bear you know when Samuel found him he was taking care of the Sheep he was not you know taken care of uh he was taken care of of what God had given him in life to take care of I believe if we'll be diligent to take care of what God has given us you know and this song was Solomon it says there's a little piece in there about taking care of your own Vineyard and you know you can take care of everybody else's Vineyards what everybody else thinks you should do what what uh where they think you should go but so many times we neglect our own what God has given us in life and God has given you first of all a responsibility to take care of your relationship with God and you you've got to make time that's tending your Vineyard pruning it making sure everything's just in order so that when God looks upon you study to show thyself approved study be diligent that's not just studying but that's doing everything study is just kind of almost like an expression that involves it includes a lot of things including studying but prayer study uh doing things that that are all part of being a Christian to show thyself and prove who unto God not under your neighbor or anything but so study do everything that you can and that's what David was doing he was doing everything that he could to take care of what God had given him in his life and you might not be a pastor of a church or uh you know different things in in in in the Walk of Life but God has given you something whether it's to to teach your little children or or or or whatever and that's what David was attending to and that's how Samuel found him and he was keeping keeping the sheep and what happened was a lion and a bear came along and he said that he rescued the sheep from his mouth he rescued the sheep from his mouth now I think mouth has something interesting in scripture because in Song of Solomon the very first verse is that the bride desires the kisses of his mouth and you know God spoke to Moses mouth to mouth he put his words and his thought into Moses mouth when you desire the kisses of God's mouth you're Desiring the personal a personal relationship a personal revelation God showing you his secret things I believe that's that's you know sometimes we look at that Song of Solomon said I've been studying on that and it's such a beautiful book when it begins to open to you and you know I've heard many people almost kind of make fun of that book as being wow almost like naughty and things but there's nothing naughty about that book I'm telling you the truth about that there's nothing there's something secret and something mysterious and something glorious about that book when you see the desire of the kisses of his mouth something when you get in your secret place and he he gives you the kisses of his mouth and the word begins to unfold you and you realize what's in the Bible you realize that what it is talking about the promises that are so special to you and the power of God begins to unfold in your life and Quicken Quicken the mechanics and so he rescued the sheep from the mouth and I believe that's what's happening today is is that there's lines and bears and things in the message in the denominational world in the church world that are taking the sheep and trying to steal them away but there is a man that could turn on the light and steal back those little sheep from the mouth that's trying to take him to pray and I believe that God sends people sends men that are not cowards but are men that will tell the truth and tell it like it is to rescue to grab that line by the beard and stare it in the face and say that you're not going to take that sheep and to say to him for anybody to say that I know the secret of God's power and to withhold it my my what what a judgment I just would hate to be in somebody's shoes like that to know the secret of the revelation of of the power of God and to withhold it and keep it back keep it a secret you know one time I was talking when I was preaching here I was talking about in early church age there was this little group called The gnostics and they wanted they they believed that they had all this Revelation but they wanted to keep a secret they would keep it secret unless you got up into the higher echelons and then they would kind of drop little nuggets as you got further up but now this is a gospel that that is proclaimed openly Jesus said Jesus told the fair season what not he told them I I've spoke openly if you want to know what I believed and ask the people that follow me I didn't tell in a secret place but I just shared it openly shared it on the Internet or wherever if there's somebody else that's if there's somebody that's preaching it I believe that somebody will that if you really have a desire to hear it you'll find it and and there's a way God has made a way uh I'm convinced of that I'm sharing you the things that I'm convinced of so you know the the only way Satan can hold you it's kind of what I'm getting at the only way Satan can hold you is by your unbelief and down through scripture you can see how the men men that could have been liberated could have been free for the power of God to be free in their life they were held captive by their unbelief and if they would have just took God at his word until it was revealed to them then they would been free and and could walk in the liberty of of God I look at look at what David when he battled that line of the bear and I don't believe when that line of that bear came up that he thought well hold on a second I got to pray a little bit that's kind of like when you're taking Taekwondo or whatever they tell you when out when when uh when you get in a real fight you're not going to have a chance to limber up hold on a second let me stretch it a little bit you know brother random said when uh uh when Joshua stopped the moon and the son he was prayed up before the foundation of the world why is that because that power of God that was in him was prayed up before the foundation of the world God don't need no preparation time he don't need any help he's that power of God is coursing through he said I'll give you Living Waters I'll give you a Wellspring of everlasting life without Wellspring of everlasting life don't need no preparation time it's ready it's always ready it's instant now in and out of season it's ready to face any challenge anytime anywhere you grab that line by the beard and and say come on and because you know if you've got the power of God in your life it's not you anymore but it's God fighting your battles and he said I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll always be with you and that's one of the things you know that you God won't leave you you have to leave him you could see that being carried out acted out today is that God God doesn't leave people they turn away and leave him isn't that some that picture of Jesus knocking on the door with it with a doorknob missing or whatever because the doorknob's on the inside you got to open it up and Jesus standing there knocking at the door trying to get in and they won't let him come in because they don't they won't believe his word they won't believe the things that he talked about they won't believe that a messenger that can reveal these things knows what he's talking about we ought to be so grateful that we found somebody that knows what they're talking about now so he took foolishness of the Gospel he took his little slingshot and he tore that bear up he tore that line up until it ran away and he got a little testimony and over time over your life you begin to accrue these little testimonies begin to accrue them until you grow more and more closer to God you begin to realize that God's word is true that he really will answer prayer that you begin to as you read the scripture and you say my goodness I didn't realize that that promise was there I didn't realize that promise was for me and you just draw closer and closer to him and it becomes more and more real and that's what David did as he came up to maybe one of the greatest challenges in his life was when he came up against the devil because that's what goliath types is the devil right we'll look at this first Samuel chapter 17. this is I I when I read this little story to my kids and I this is one story in the Bible this in Hebrews 11. that I can hardly read without crying because it just shows the power of God in action it shows God made manifest in somebody's life that will take him in his word it doesn't matter if you know now look at this story the whole everybody that should have been on David's side was against him everybody on the other side was against him but that didn't matter it doesn't matter if the whole world's against you if God's on your side and that's one thing that boggles me is that men and the message that are ministers that say that they're afraid that somebody will find out what they believe I don't care if the whole world is what I believe you know at my work they've been sending out uh this this the LGBT Pride stuff has been catching on and they send out these big newsletters with rainbows and stuff how they they've hijacked the rainbow and took that over and they're not ashamed of what they believe now we should how should we shouldn't be ashamed of what we believe because there's power in what we believe you shouldn't you shouldn't be ashamed of the Gospel you know the Believers have little things in their life that separate you when you get down at lunch and you bow your head over your meal that is a separation it separates you from the things of the world and everybody looks on that and sees that something is different about you somebody that respects God enough to put their head down over their meal it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks it doesn't matter what anybody else says but the power of God is living inside of you an example of light and so um in first Samuel chapter 17 the Philistines that gathered their armies to battle and were gathered together here show called which belongeth to Judah and pitched their tents and I'm just going to kind of skim down and and verse 3 and the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side and Israel on the other side and there was a valley between him and they went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath nine and a half nine feet and seven feet nine feet seven inches tall great big old fella and you know he represents the devil you remember brother random talking about how uh that uh Vision he had of the the the the how the devil came up a great big old thing and and he began to boo it the devil got smaller smaller and it seemed like he got great big old huge muscles but brother Brandon don't have real big muscles and real didn't have big muscles in real life and David didn't either so where did he get those muscles he got those muscles by a revelation of the word of God because faith is a revelation he got them because he began to realize that it began to be convinced of the power that laid within him you know I think many times we struggle it to realize what is inside of us if we have the new birth if the person of Jesus Christ is inside of us I'm running out of time here but I I have some some quotes I'm going to share in just a minute so hang on with me about what where we should be about where we should be as as Christians and the Philistines stood on the mountain let me read down they went on a champion out of the camp another Philistines named Goliath of gath whose height was six cubits in the span and he had a helmet of brass and he describes all of my goodness so intimidating you can say well well they got all these people with llds and phds and all this kind of stuff and I I just love that little movie Luther about how Martin Luther got up in front of all those people with the phds and the llds and everything and he prayed all night before and he went up there and he went up there with boldly he grabbed that line by the beard and he looked it in the face and he told him how it was and he told him by the power of God the power of that the spirit of the lord gave him the words to say in that hour I'll give you the words to say and and he and he just he he God I believe God really likes men who are not cowards who will just men and women who will you know what a a coward in the gospel is somebody who looks at God's word and say I can't it ain't gonna work but if you just take it and just lean on it there's power in there there's power in leaning on his word on the gospel and the staff of this beer was like a Weaver's beam and his spirit's head weighed 600 shekels of iron and one bearing of Shield went before Oh my scary scary stuff but not to David and he stood and cried under the armies of Israel and said on them why are you come out to sit your battling array I'm not I Philistine and ye service to Saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me and if he'd be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your service but if I Prevail against him and it goes on it now look nobody was willing to do that nobody was willing to accept the challenge because nobody had the Revelation that David had nobody knew the power of God that's something to think about David did David had the revelation and David was let's see let me skip down carry these 10 cheeses verse 18. and David Rose up early in the morning and all men of Israel fled when they saw him sorry I'm not as prepared as I maybe should have been and the people answered him after this man are saying so shall be done to the man that killeth him whoever kills Goliath gets a wife is one of the things isn't that beautiful and Jesus killed Goliath on the cross and as a reward he got a bride he redeemed the bride and now look here comes David with a confession of the power of God in verse 27 and the people said answered after this manager so shall it be done to the man that killeth him in a lab his oldest brother heard him when he's speaking of the men and his Elias anger was Kindle against David and he said why came us down hither and with whom as thou left those few sheep in the wilderness I knew that I pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou might have see the battle see it's like you try to do something good and you always have somebody opposing you but that didn't matter to David David David just forged right ahead and when the words were heard which David Spade verse 31 they rehearsed him before Saul and he sent for him and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine and that's really what I'm trying to get across today let no man's heart fail because there is a man here that can turn on the light there is a man here that can reveal the secrets the Mysteries the Hidden Mysteries and when he reveals it to you it'll bring power to your life power this light was it it was with David and David did not have the Holy Ghost no that's right now that's quite a revelation today I I I I used to be a little bit naive in the message about some of these things but I'm realizing how odd that is to believe that that I went out after him and smote him and he's talking about the lion and the bear and I servant salute both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing you have to fire the armies of the Living God that's a confession when you can make a confession look for like that about all the little problems in your life from your stub toe to whatever to your children coming back to the Lord to whatever it is this Philistine is going to be subject to the power of God 's gonna have his way with this problem and Saul armed David with his armor and he tried that's that's where my see if David would have fell into that trap of being of moving into the the doctrines and things that Saul had Saul's way in other words what Saul was doing is I you know I heard your confession about the lion and the bear but I'm not quite convinced and he wasn't quite convinced because he didn't have a revelation of that himself but David did and he wasn't convinced in these doctrines of man and things that that will cover up the holes in the dike that will seek keep the the power of the ocean from flooding in he wasn't convinced that but he was convinced that if he put his trust in God if he put his trust in the word it everything would be all right and so that's what he you know brother I'm talking about it you get your little will of Faith turning with the power of God you get everything lined up that's right if you if your faith matches what's in the Bible then something's got to happen something has got to happen if if your motives and objectives are lined up with what is already written in the Bible there's nothing that can stop it it's like a freight train a freight train of God's word that cannot be stopped now David put his faith in these five little stones j-e-s-u-s and he he wrapped him in his five fingers f-a-i-t-h and he went to meet Goliath and he said where all that stung over his head and that stone struck Goliath and didn't matter that there was a helmet on his head but the power of God took took Goliath out and and knocked him down the power of God manifested looks Mighty strange because David was a little scrawny runt Jesus was looked like he had no power when he was down on the cross but that was more power right there than maybe the world had ever seen you know I heard this story about polycarp praying fervently when it came to take him away to to be to be burned to the stake in polycarp this is Britain in the fox's book of Martyrs how he laid down and he said just give me a little bit to pray and he prayed so fervently that the guards were convicted in their heart and they turned you think in an hour like that where there would be no power we're taking you to burn you at the stake and in that hour he calls men to be converted think about in the fox's book of Martyrs just written how the Believers would be put out on the ice cold lake and standing on the frozen ice and they would sing songs and people would the guards sometimes would throw down their their uh their armor and run out there to be partakers of that power that they saw made manifest there what kind of power where people would gladly give their lives and in that moment it looked like they had no power but a power greater than than any that the world knows was made in manifest what about Peter hanging up side down though I don't want to be crucified like my Lord hang me upside down the power like that where the world is is taking away his life taking away everything but he's in his last hour he doesn't want to be his humility and meekness takes over and he says I don't want to I'm not worthy to be crucified like that and power Came Upon it that he would give his life freely and at the end of brother random's life this is one of the things that they always like to quote it looked like his message had less power at the end than at the beginning because he started preaching at little home churches little things little uh just little trailers and things just you can hear on the tapes it sounds like it used to he used to create preach a great big coliseums where it just echoed but then at the end of his ministry at just a little small little group of people where the greatest things power his ministry was leading up to that great power the opening of the word the revealing of these Mysteries to give us power because that's what the third pool does that's what the uh the seventh seal the opening of the word all these things to give us power to open up the diet to open up everything so that the fullness of God could come into the bride and there won't be anything to prohibit it no doubt in this at all no unbelief nothing to hinder God's power being made manifest in US what about Jacob weak and limping where he wrestled all night until he brother Randall said he he just he got weak and yielded to the angel and he got the angel touched him and he never walked the same again it looked like he got weak it looked like he lost but in that weakness that he was weak the night before but the next day he walked with power toward Esau because something had changed and he never walked the same again now that in the Old Testament the Old Testament types talk about having power with God power through faith power through Revelation the power that Abel had and all the all the men that you if you walk through Hebrews 11 look at all these men that have faith with God power with God because they believed God's message but now where should we be today where God is living inside of US Clothing in itself availing us in our flesh when no ecclesiastical system in the world can explain it away from you then you've got power with God where nobody there's nothing anybody can tell you to say well maybe this isn't right because you've got a revelation from God right okay all right you've got something real something true let me uh I'm just gonna switch gears a second here and look at some quotes and we'll be closing in just a minute you know Jesus told the disciples I'll make you Fishers for men and in that and all those little third pool visions and things the angel taught brother Branham how to fish the fish that were deep down right they were interested in hearing the Mysteries here in the gospel and I believe that we're all interested in hearing something that will give us power I I didn't give the brothers in the back this quote but this is in a resume of the ages oh this is in the church age boot chapter 10. if ever an age received a message loud and clear this age did it was and is that Old Testament truth the son of the bond one will distress the son of the free woman into the son of the bomb want to be cast out that lets us know that the hatred and blasphemy of Satan against the true Christian will be vented through a group who are nominal false Christians and this will increase until God uproots that false Vine at the end of the layout of CN age so when you see people turning and rending and and doing things that's right that's how it's supposed to be you know to be honest when I was a lot younger in the message I I kind of wondered how there could be so many people to believe the message because it seemed like the way that the continent of the scripture ran it should be just a very hey you know the way I believe it is it it if you put a lot of little kids in a room and put a cupcake out in front of them they might not all like chocolate cake they might say well I don't like it and you put the gospel in a room and everybody's not going to like it but I like it very much I I appreciate the word you know that's how that's how it's not that God forced the chocolate cake Force the the word forced us to believe it but we have a choice we have a choice to believe it and God just like he's looked down and saw David's choice that he would believe it and accept it and run with it I believe he's looked down and saw our choice and that's my faith and I believe that everybody in this building that's my confession that that we'll all come to it and now let's go ahead and pull up that first quote Brothers um number one take the rod and gather the people now get ready because I believe these are some good quotes paragraph e37 hey he's talking about the healing line and the prayer different cases cancer cases and things that same as Christ can heal you make you well sir let's keep on down to where I've highlighted did you ever see a person that was possessed of demons and this was my prayer years ago when I was when I was praying for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and seeking it that I I I kind of I would confess this to the Lord that I believe that you know you look around and see people filled with demon power and doing things and it looks like they they've got power power to throw people across the room and power like that but what about what God can do for you with the power of the Holy Ghost I believe if if he can give if the devil can give somebody power like that then that God can give somebody so much more power and look at this look at this quote how much more power there are many times their their power because the devil has given them superpower if the devil can give a man five or six times his power what all the Holy Spirit to do a million times your power he is your strength and your help do you believe that have faith in God let's look at number two now watch this doctrine of Baylor most careful carefully notice above all that it is the deliberate maneuver of a corrupt clergy to bind the people to them by Leading the People deliberately into the sin of unbelief deliberately well look at what that brothers that that his brother said that he deliberately preached psychology for a year and cloaked it behind words of conceit and deceit and and smiling and things and my the nicolete in Doctrine was the corruption of the clergy as they sought political power and I put this in here because this is what binds us unbelief is what binds us it keeps us from realizing from enjoying the liberty of God as they saw political power among themselves while balaamism is the subjection of the people of their system of creed and worship in order to hold them now watch this carefully what was it that bound the people to the nominal church and thereby destroyed them it was the Creeds and dogmas formed into church tennis it was the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church they were not given the True Food the word they were given the food that came from idol worship Babylonian paganism wrapped up in Christian terminology you know brother Brown preached about case Division I believe if you can catch the vision of this little simple truth that they really get the power of God in your life it's got to be the word of God has to be revealed to you then you'll begin to attend church come to church and and study to show thyself approved unto the god study and remember study includes a lot of different things coming to church studying your Bible praying all those things and if you catch the vision it makes it so much easier to do these little things if you know why you're doing it if God reveals it to you why it's important now birth pains number three no man has a right to preach the gospel until he's met back met God back on the back side of the desert in that burning bush to where there's no ecclesiastical system and the world can explain it away from you now that's how every believer should be but of course you shouldn't present it you shouldn't be speaking it unless you've got this but now every believer should come to this place where there's no nobody can come up to you and say well have you read this quote have you seen this and then it pulls you away from you should be so solid that's what we should all be striving for I believe is where we come to it up just a solid the solid rock of Revelation on which we stand number four I I'm sorry I hope I'm not wearing you out and that's what's the matter with the Pentecostal church tonight the Full Gospel people they just don't realize who they are right maybe that's the same problem we have to realize the power of God is in us and if we can just believe God's word if we can just believe it now let me start reading and stop talking you don't realize the power of this ride in this building tonight but it's harnessed down by unbelief that's the only thing if God could ever get an Avenue to work through you it would be marvelous what he could do but it's harnessed You Won't Let it Loose you keep it with your unbelief with unbelief now how how do you get how do you get rid of your unbelief how do you get a revelation in faith is a revelation the faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word that's why you need to be in church yeah who hath believed I report number five 1951. oh my this is such a good one it's a short one but a good one his power is unlimited amen it's limited to your faith do you believe it right let's look at number six my new ministry 1959. Divine healings for you if God will reveal that to you that's for you but you can't just stumble it it's got to come by Revelation and when it's revealed that now he's talking about healing now but I think this applies to anything because he said once you've got if God give you the baptism the Holy Ghost then he can heal you and you that's that's one of the things that stumbles people he talked about coming into the prayer line and and somebody that was maybe just the prostitute off the street would get healed and somebody that would feel the Holy Ghost would struggle because they all these flus were stopped up you start thinking that your your memory and your reason and all these things are stopped up and you think that healing is not for you when it's laying right there on the buffet table of God's word divine healings for you if God will reveal that to you that that's for you but you can't just stumble it it's got to come by Revelation and when it's revealed that by his stripes you were healed there's nothing Satan can even do as our young brother from Sellersburg said all the Devils couldn't move it sure when something is revealed where something is revealed let me I'm trying to I'm about to run out of time and uh let's go to number nine it doesn't take what we would think a great thing it only takes a hand that's completely Anointed with the Holy Ghost with God's power to strike down an enemy under any circumstance the musicians can go ahead and come forward I'm just finishing up the eagle in her nest number 10. oh brother the Lord Jesus is coming someday the Great Eagle of heaven and only those who are magnetized by the power of the Holy Ghost will take that ride bolted down Creeds and denominations and shavings of aluminum light thinkers light ambitions I think the Church of God should be the highest thinker the highest Ambitions that there is in the world ought to dwell with Christians to impress the mark to the High Calling of Christ certainly now what I want to leave you with is that when David killed that Goliath that killed what represented the devil he destroyed it he smote it down by the power of God you remember what all the other all the other Israelites did they started killing Phyllis things too because they began they caught the Revelation that God was with him and if I could leave you with anything it's that remember that God is still that's what that's what when we look when we listen to the tapes and see that God was moving in brother Brown's life we shouldn't look at that and say well God was in his life and and well that's good enough for me but I want him to be in my life too I want him to be that that's evidence that he can be in my life that's not just evidence that he can be in somebody else's life just over there like Perugia but he can be a personal presence inside of me living inside of me uh working and doing out his will inside of me will stand to our feet and I wonder if if you want more of the power of God in your life and you want to start killing more Philistines like David just lift your hand up as we go to prayer this is all about our heads Lord Jesus we thank you God for your presence tonight thank you God for the opening of your word thank you God for your grace to us Lord Jesus Lord we thank you God for examples in your word of Great Men of Faith who took you at your word and believed that you were always the same yesterday today and forever and that's my confession tonight Lord Jesus said I'm not ashamed of that you're still the same yesterday today and forever you're still present in your people in your church Lord you're still walking among the candlesticks still walking among the people showing yourself Lord and Lord God I pray Lord that you'll remember everyone that raised their hand tonight Lord Jesus God and make yourself visible Among Us Lord Jesus make yourself make it so real to us Lord Jesus we'll see you not just when we come to church but every day at the weakest moment of the day at work Lord Jesus when it seems like everything's going wrong because all these men that we just looked at and they're live and it seemed like there was no power that's when you were the greatest on the scene in Samson's life when they poked his eyes out and you came on the scene and delivered Lord God we believe that you're still the same you're still able to heal they're still able to deliver you're still able to save the lost and cause the sin sick and the loss to return to you Lord God and Lord we thank you because of your power Lord now Lord let it be made manifest in your in our lives we pray and we ask believing Lord Jesus we all say Amen turn it over to build a deal amen he's still here he's not somewhere else he's still here he's here this is strong this is great as he's ever been because if he didn't you would have Hebrews 13 8. I'm singing today I'll hold on coming let's see let's see if the power of God is assigned today let's see if it's real hello have my heart about it do you believe that power is still the same you know if even side says energy cannot be created nor destroyed energy this didn't start out with some energy force in this finally formed into a human being all the energy there is in the world come from our savior our daughter our Lord me by Grace the gospel of God is the power under salvation delivered us with destruction been broken how about it anybody else again being there anybody else think about the power of God how about it foreign yeah there was a god incident tonight in what brother Bob was preaching um I say that because it's a you know a coincidence a god incidents right okay so several years ago about eight years ago uh I made a series of choices and brother Bob was talking about that during the end of the sermon and I was already thinking on that line before he said that I've been thinking and praying about it about choices a lot here lately but I made a series of choices a bunch of them that pretty much affected everything from there on out when I started my adult life I didn't realize how big a lot of these decisions would affect things in my life going forward or I would have been more and I was sincere believe me I was and prayerful but I there's I could have been more sincere and a lot of the things that I decided but you know Gabby and I decided we'd either have two kids or four kids we'd have an even number of kids well so far that's the plan still sticking towards to the plan and we decided uh that she'd be a stay-at-home mom and so far we've carried that out and but it's you know partly because I'm doing the job that I'm doing that I'm making enough for her to stay at home so that's why I'd hate to see this job go I'd hate to lose it uh but my boss came to me back when he offered me this position he said if you're willing to miss church every so often on a Wednesday night he said uh that you can have this job driving okay just bear with me for a second okay so so I took that job and that was it I mean I didn't I should have said I'll go home and pray about it I'll go home and think about it but right there on the spot I said oh sure you know I mean I was 21 years old or so I said well I mean I I was young and dumb and I said well sure I'll take it I don't mind missing every so often he didn't say how often that would be I thought it'd be once a month maybe at the most and at times during the summer he gets to where it's almost every Wednesday night we don't get to come to church because I'm hauling chicken so much and one of the things I'd hate about losing that job too is because I it's my prayer closet I drive an 80 000 pound prayer closet you know and I get a lot of praying a lot of reading it's like brother Dale's job at GM he has he had time to read and study and pray I worked 14 hours a day a lot of days and I'm only on the road eight so during those eight hours I had to listen to sermons and during the rest of the time at The Farms I'm waiting to load I'm reading my Bible and praying it's a great opportunity so I want the Lord to work it out if there'd be anyway but I prayed about it for years and I don't know why I've never asked y'all to but there's a lot of power here like but the ball was talking about represented in this group I want y'all to agree with me and that the Lord will work something out if it's his will for me to keep this job if not then so be it because what he wants for me is a lot better than what I want for me and for my family so we just want to be at church only tonight is what I'm saying and it's been more of a burden the last few weeks because of a series of circumstances we had a Kentucky trip followed by me working late on Wednesday night followed by a funeral service this past Sunday that we had to miss the church so but that's made me even more sincere about really just wanting to get this thing over with and just get something worked out I mean just a different schedule and the same job would be perfect so just pray with me just agree with me thank you Jesus that's where we'll just pray believe it you work it all out on him you believe that you believe that he'll work it all out well that's just thinking for it all right Lord Jesus you know our brother you know the sincerity of heart and things father we just pray that you'd help him and you work everything out for your honor and Glory and Lord we know you will sometimes we don't understand maybe your ways and things but yet we accept it and we say thank you we believe you because all is well we thank you for your loving and Grace into it thank you for the message tonight our brothers brought unto us because truly we believe in your power Lord we believe that that is the greatest thing in the world to realize that our God is real and he's Among Us and doing and moving Lord not like the world of thinking that well we just go to church but we come believing you and expecting you to meet us and guide us Lord just help us bless everybody now on the way home give everybody a safe journey and may your love and grace be with each and every one of us we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen make sure you tell our brother how much you appreciated the message that he brought tonight because we believe it yes sir believe the message believe him and he's real right amen no man
