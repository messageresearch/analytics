========================================

oh you know as many times as moses had come so close to god but you know he still wanted to see you know what god allowed him to see sure he got to see the back part but he got to see something i mean good to see everybody in the house the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to revelations one we're going to start a series kind of on the study of the book of revelations but this is actually leading up to uh revelations 5 where we really want to get to and speak a while in revelation 5 and revelation 6. but i want to get this part anchored real good in you to have a better understanding you know of what we're talking about but we just pray that the lord will bless those who are terrible brother mark brother don and then we're coming back home i think starting out today and traveling and then coming home from there and wait in june we'll be there for a week and coming home on monday of after this not just coming monday but the next one and so this little vacation time so just pray for these the lord would would take care of him and all that amen revelations one the only father we thank you lord most of all for you being our father being the one that would lead us and goddess that you'd give us eternal life that you'd come down and dwell among us you'd make a way that we might receive your life into our our being that we could rest in you and be your children be your offspring and we pray that you would just bless each one lord and remember you promised you'd heal us and lord we thank you for it you said you sent your word and you healed us and delivered us from destruction so we thank you and we ask you to just have your way now as we read your word as we talk about you you come on the scene and lord open our eyes that we may see truly open the eyes of our heart lord because that's what we need we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us in jesus name amen revelations 1 1-3 so the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to price and he said and signified it by his angel and to his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you may deceive the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now i want to get like i said a few things to our hearts and minds and our thinking and then we will be speaking from revelations 5 and going on into revelation 6. brother brown actually says that in revelations 5 he said this is the opening of those seals in revelations 5. so then you know we need to uh get an understanding and maybe we'll get down to that eventually i'm kind of slow but and i'll get there you know like that i hope you enjoyed this morning and actually trying to bring out some points that are on it but you know you get so much packed in until i didn't get the part of the message that i wanted uh to get to because see i believe that jesus christ had the resurrection sign not only that he was raised in the dead that was it you know but he had the word that would raise the dead right because he was that word all right and he could raise the dead and see that was the sign of the resurrection preceding the coming of the point to where that he would pay the price and do all of the things and that would be the sign of the resurrection we'll then see brother brown coming in the last days and you know like i've always told you then you don't find paul peter john and him writing other than matthew mark luke and john now's writing about the son of man because that was writing at the time but you don't find any of the apostles speaking of even paul with the greatest of understanding he never mentions the son of man because that was not for their time it was not an understanding for them but then you hear brother adam starting out in the first part of his ministry you know and he's talking about the son of man and he's talking about the sign of the son of man all right and see the sign of the son of man was the fact of the word being brought back to the position to where that he could stand there and and declare those things and the dead would be raised because of the opening of the word and that would be you know the point so you know and i see i believe this message is the resurrection message now this message the prophet that is brought unto us that is the resurrection message all right so then we're not looking for something to come to uh change us no more than we were talking about this morning the prophet saying your resurrection is inside of you all right all we need to do is just get it outside of us right i mean that's as plain as we could be and it's shortened terms but we need to get it into manifestation and to me that's the statue of a perfect man the things the prophet taught or what we we need that but i just you know i didn't have time to bring it and all but they said richard said to run out of batteries said was taking an hour battery trying to stretch it for an hour and a half so they suggested that not that i get another battery so you can figure on the rest of it but now let's just think about it you know the book of revelations is a great thing and i will repeat this repeatedly throughout the message not today as much but as we're going along in the series because you know what i believe the brother brown says in the church age book that page 13 and i won't use it here we'll do it later that this is the only book in the bible whereas that jesus christ himself appearing personally to ascribe to right all right so then there were we read you know this is a revelation that god give to jesus to give to john that's not trinitarianism that's not no forms of that it's just uh the basis of what was actually taking place and and in doing that then we'll see uh you know what it is in in the understanding all right and and follow it a little closer but it's the only book the prophet said that whereas jesus personally appearing to a scribe all right then if that's what happened there then he's writing but he's writing as we read in just a second he's writing about himself in the church now you find nowhere and i ask you to do this you can find it you find nowhere in the book of revelations you find no place that jesus christ is by himself all right now i want you to show it to me if you can find it uh you know through the opening of the seals through the different things and showing that it'll take place and work takes place and all that but he's never shown by himself because it's the book written but it's the book written about him in his church all right now so then i preached a series back quite a while ago on a little thing to uh let you know that it was showing it that in that book he appears in the people or with the people mainly in the people it's very rarely you'll see him mentioned about him even being there it's him in the people to reveal himself and it's a future book so then it's your book you remember a preaching that series owner called it the bride's book see the book of revelations is actually our book if you want to know where you're at read the book of revelation of course we were told by mankind you can't understand this you can't understand that stay out of the book of revelation all right i'll read it to you in a minute why that that has been said to us you know to stay out of those things because satan don't want you to realize who you are and what's going on so if you was to tell me said brother dale i want to take away everything you've got and you're going to prison etcetera or whatever you're going to do put them on all the patents and beyond wouldn't make no difference but uh you're only going to be allowed to take one book well naturally we would say the bible but then it's okay now you're going to be allowed to take one book out of the bible you know well i take the book of revelation i mean i would because in that i could find myself because i know it's talking about me all right it's not talking about somebody else it's not talking about what paul and him could prophesy and they were speaking personal for the hour they were living but this is the message straight to us and we thank god for that all right now see as i said people have taught us to stay out of the book of revelation because we can't understand it you got these symbols you've got all these things in there well we've had a prophet to come down and tell us what these things mean all right so thank god for the prophet to bring the message and if you notice in revelations 1 there that we were reading it says the prophecy the words of this prophecy all right and see i gave it to you so go ahead brother uh joe and pull up remember anderson no he's not that okay we got another one today who's that joey book number one i'd just like to give you these things where you can look at them because remember as i said the other day about the messenger see we talk about prophecy prophecy our prophecy all right p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y prophecy that's what's written in revelation there all right p-r-o-p-h-e-s-y is more or less like the prophet speaking you know i mean god's speaking through somebody all right you know and and do it but the word prophecy is more or less and the best way i can give you the definition the way i see it is prophecy is a unfolding or are are gathering together to show us what's in the book all right see it's unfolding of the book because it's the prophecy all right and see then you'll see here it says prophecy which is from the greek word 43 94 in other words a discourse emitting or in other words a a message or a wording that you're bringing forth that's the prophet is prophesying see to do all right but the word prophecy is a discourse a meaning remember you pronounce the words from divine inspiration and declaring the purposes of god see so it's a setting in order of scriptures all right so you can see then that the prophet of god the one we believe in the end time god gave him this to say to us and what he's given unto us the message then is a prophecy p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y because it's a setting in order of the scriptures all right it is not just a man saying things all right so you see what it's doing is a discourse in meaning from divine inspiration and declaring the purposes of god whether by reproving or admonishing the wicked are confronting the afflicted are revealing things hidden all right whatever it be then let it be that now as to come forth the a prophecy see then don't get into it and say prophecy prophecy you know i'm just trying to do that the word to give you an understanding of prophecy so thank god see without the prophet now listen without the prophet to explain expound the word or to take this book of prophecy and speak upon it and unveil it or reveal it see then the the uh denominational systems is right are the people that don't get in the book of revelation see because you don't understand what the symbols are that's right but we have had a message to bring it to where we can understand what is being said if you want to know what's what this means then just go look up the prophet you know see what he says that it means and then just say well that's it and what always caught me because that was the thing that caught me when i came into the message was it was a a man that god could use to do all those things but yet he could explain things so simple that i could understand it you know a child can understand what the bible means the book of revelations means why because a prophet has expounded it so simple yes why why didn't we read it that way you know why didn't we read it that way to start with but see we had this big mind of the things that we've been taught see that you can't understand these things all right now i'm going to give you what the prophet had to say about it then so let's let's find out what he said but let's see who it's two and what it's about go ahead with number two a brother joe and i had to add these in and uh darren said we don't have no add-ons i said okay put it to the end i'll move to the front but in the on the church on the message the revelation of jesus christ now this is not in 60 1204 but it's not church anybody paragraph 80. it's all about when our lord and comes the earth and things and jesus said it's not for you to know this hour or time and talk about his second coming and no one would know that even the son as yet did not know you remember that in the scripture he said the son didn't know he didn't know about his coming all right but now read this very carefully with me you know i'm not going to be in no hurry about this uh ex you know trying to do the study because i'm gonna just tie it together for ken but look but after his death burial and resurrection and ascension into glory he speaking of jesus right receive from god the father of the church i mean god of god the future of the church all right and what he received from god the future of the church now the question is is the thought is about his coming right now he immediately puts his coming into church he's not speaking of a physical coming of the skies are opening up right see the prophet is immediately placing it in order to where he's talking about see but after his death burial resurrection see then you'll see why that it says that the revelation that god gave to jesus all right now jesus when he was hearing flesh sure he was almighty god in flesh but he was flesh too that's right all right so it was withholding from the flesh man you say well how in the world could that be because it was god well that's the best way to answer that is why would he say um the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach to god why would he say that see that was revealed to him that day when he sat down he said this day this scripture is fulfilled all right so you said but yet he was he was almighty god that's true you have the holy ghost don't you you claim the new birth do you know everything oh what's wrong the holy ghost in you knows all things right but see there's a lot of problems getting that back out of earth from down inside up to the head and then the biggest problem is getting it from up in the head down into the heart so you know i'm just being honest that's the way jesus was see that he then when he was on earth that was withholding that's right all right but then after his death burial and resurrection now when he comes to john patency but after his death burial and resurrection and ascension into glory he received from god the future of the church then he returned back and watched to bring this message to the church now that's not the coming of the day of pentecost now that had to take place to where this could happen right that's right because you had to put the holy spirit within us to understand but that's not what he's talking about you return back to bring this message to the church and this message of is coming in the condition of the church is down to the age that's what's happening here in the book of revelation it's unfolding now what it's doing very simple in it he could not do it before his death burial and resurrection because he had not yet knew it but did you notice how the scripture reads here the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him christ he gave it unto him to bring down all right now watch how that god the father gave the revelation to his son jesus christ and he sent his angel to john to signify these things which was which which was which was which he is and which is shall be oh it's so beautiful you see it's beautiful all right now so it's not a trinitarian concept it's the fact of that while jesus was here on the earth there was things that was withholding from him that would be made known all right then he would have to come himself to personally appear to john to write all right and then appearing to john to write it it would be bringing forth the revelation to to us but what i want you to get is you missed the whole thing of one one point he's going to show his future point in the church that's right man because the church is going to be his coming that's right he didn't know when he was coming that's right right right i see we're thinking coming means a day oh yeah here it comes down out of the sky drop down no see his coming has been in motion since the day of pentecost the second coming i'm talking about easily to understand the first coming walked up on earth but the second coming of jesus christ he has where everybody's looking out there for it one of these days the sky's going open one of these days it's gonna happen no he's been coming for two thousand years yes see that's the second coming of jesus christ that's where people miss it that's right they're looking for some kind of a great to do horn and the different things that happen and see him walk down and all and see that's what they're taught but he started his second coming on the dead pentecost by the baptist by the holy cows all right now he's coming to john to explain this of what it would be and he explains the church ages right right chapter two and three then he goes through four five and then he goes through the the other things are showing the entirety of the future as it was said here to the church but he's going to show the church see that's what we're looking at we think that god's going to show the church something now god's going to show the church who she is that is something yeah that's the concern i want to be is who am i all right we sing a song who am i lord you know but see the second coming of jesus christ is not a physical corporal coming down that will happen but not as a physical that's right it never happens that way we meet him in the air we're going to meet the corporal body the prophet said in the area he does not set his feet back upon earth until the millennium all right so we're not looking for the physical coming that's why the prophet would say he said these people that say they got oil on their hand blood and oil and things like that he said they're saying that the second coming is already here you never heard brent around talking about oil and blood and things you didn't hear jesus paul or any of them talking about blood here and doing this and doing that no why because that would be making the physical coming that's right if you had the blood of jesus here doesn't mean he's physically here that's right you see that's not scriptural that's right because you're not going to be physically here we're going to meet him in the air we're going to a millennium and then when that's finished then he comes here and we come right back with it all right so then you'll see the point that what i'm trying to get at that it's it's god is going to reveal himself of his coming but he's doing it by showing you how his coming takes place you see you and i that's right you should you and i all right is that right now see that's why satan satan is the one see that's always said you can't understand the book of revelation you can't understand jensen huh why because it's the two books that shows his origin right in his ending right it shows its origin amen now it's easy to follow genesis as origin right and talk about satan you know when it created the anointed sheriff et cetera and then we can you know jump over but my point i want you to see is one thing the prophet god said that when jesus went up said he was there hanging on a cross he said judas was hanging on a cross right he said and satan took judas jesus went to hell but you know satan took jesus judas went to hell why because he rejected the word now but he said on the resurrection all right jesus rose all right but we don't watch there was another raising there because satan was going to start raising right okay now then on the day of pentecost the prophet said that jesus came back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost he said and satan came back in the form of the antichrist all right so then everything god does satan follows it that's right that's why you notice in the bible that it doesn't talk about him being uh the the satanic cardinal until the later part of the book of revelation why because he don't know how to do it yeah i said it's true he has to follow god now brother said it like this one time he said he tops after god now he's not a type of god no no no he ties after god in other words he does what he does after god moves when god went up he went up when god come down he come down all right so then now we see him as the the point that he don't want this book of revelation to be understood that's right because it shows his origin all right and it shows his destruction so he hates the book of revelations because he doesn't like that part there that where he can see all right okay let's go to number two on your notes brother all right this is verse 14 church age book have you ever noticed how satan hates two books of the bible more than all others now watch through liberal theologians and how that pursuit of scientists against that weapon he's always attacking the book of genesis and the book of revelation now who's he attacking it he's always attacking it through the theologians and the the people see and then it comes down to the people right all right that's the deeds of nicholas we read in a second in both of these books we find satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction all right that is why he attacks them like i've always tried to tell you if the devil tries to tell you something about yourself just doing so well one of these days you're going to be destroyed you don't ever talk to him yeah oh you're i'm not going to like this one we spend 90 of our time talking to the devil and ten percent talking to god whether you like that or not oh i'll tell you what i don't talk to the devil no wonder he doesn't got you he only talks to the people he don't got is that good english yeah right in both of these we find satan's origin in awful ways and destruction that is why attacks him he hates to be exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is jesus said about satan he has no part in me and i have no part in him now listen that's something in it that's scripture the devil would like to prove that different now why would the devil like to prove that that statement that jesus says that he has no part with me why would he like to disprove that come on why would the prophet bring that out because you see the devil has always tried to make himself god right right and i've always told you and i believe it the devil he's a dummy i agree destructor you know destructive but he's also very smart the bible said he's wiser and daniel huh brother said don't tackle him that's what he said he said don't tackle him he said don't even tackle that good bad just steal ocean he said he'll tear you apart with a word but you see the devil he wants to get back where he was standing beside of the lord and he figures if he can get enough help on his side and if he ever makes it back to there then he may be able to conquer and take over yeah but you see what the prophet look what he's making to emphasis it exposes what he is jesus said he has no part in me and i have no part in him see if he can get some way connected back and get close and you know that brother around says that we call him jesus jesus and worship the devil now he didn't say if you call him father son holy ghost that's good anybody know that he said that comes the pits of hell but he said you can call him jesus jesus and worship the devil no i know who he is yeah i know i know how you make that out too you make that out like i always try to express it you ask people how they didn't know what that start oh he comes to me so sweet and so long the devil comes to me he's mad and horrible you know i have been told to sit down and shut up by the holy spirit and it certainly wasn't the devil telling me that because he was telling me the truth that i needed to quit crying like a baby and get him walk but you see that's what we think oh he's so sweet and humble he wasn't too humble when he planted a rope together and drove him out of the temple now they didn't think he was they thought the condo priest was jesus right they didn't think about that being god okay you know the devil would like to prove it different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence watch in the word when the church disbelieves satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the gates of hell cannot prevail against him see now he don't like it because it shows his destruction all right look now here is his origin we're not i told you a moment ago i said he seemed to see his origin in genesis because you don't talk about his creation but we're trying to move over into where we are in the study of the book of revelation so in the book of revelation watching origin revelation 2 6 for thou hast for this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicholas which i hate also that's bringing him into view because that's the deeds of the nicolas conquer the laity that's his origin in the new testament we'll see in a minute what he uses to do you're seeing it but a quote we gave he tries to discredit the word all right so then that's where he takes over to where what in the nicolaitans conquer the laity the what by perverting the word all right that's your origin which is destruction revelations 10 20 and 10 and the devil that deceived them that was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever the devil that deceived them was cast in two so that's just destruction so if he tries to tell you you ain't worth nothing say that one thing about it i can show you where you're going and what will be taken care of just talk to him he said oh i ain't going to talk to him why just tell him we use god's word because you try to use your own thoughts and everything you know it won't work look at the next one number three this is page 15 church eighth book or the revelation of jesus christ let me show you another reason why satan hates this book of the revelation of jesus christ in the church now you notice maybe you didn't understand my point one ago but just read it the book of revelation is the revelation of jesus christ's word in the church watch that he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday and forever and he changes not right he knows that a whole lot more than do 90 of the theologians he knows that since god is immutable in his nature which means unchangeable you know he doesn't change then he is just as immutable in his ways thus satan knows assuredly that the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action is the true church that jesus claimed as his own all else it's false it has to be see my point now get i like to keep making statements over and over it don't bother me they do you but see this revelation is the revelation of jesus christ well why why didn't in other words why didn't no this is what we think happened we think it's a revelation of jesus christ that god give to jesus to give to john this anger signifies you know huh see we think well this is a great revelation of jesus oh he's up into the heavens he's up there he's going to be on all of the stars the rainbows the moons of god and all and showing him up into the heavenly heavens and all of that but that's not what happened because he wasn't up there doing that then the time the book of revelation was written in 1895-96 see he had already come back into the garage so where's he's coming oh it's wet and under one of these days the skies will split no i use i tell you what i used to think the kid somebody told me when you seen the coming of the lord you go out in the cloud and you look and they'd see a great big old a great big umbrella i never really understand how come up with that but there'd be a great big umbrella that would be out and he'd be hanging down on the bottom looking huh you know that's what i thought what'd you think but you see he's coming in his church you don't get nothing out of the message today get that point he's coming in his church and he's going to reveal himself in his church we think he's revealing himself to the church see that's about seeing the great victory where he is and all of what he does all these rainbows no he's revealing himself in his church that's what satan hates he don't want you to get the revelation of who you are better watch that clock now because i remember i started get the point now if you don't get nothing else get the point there's two things satan hates he hates the book of revelations in genesis because it shows his origin and his destruction all right now but truly the book of revelations shows jesus christ and where he's at and it proves his coming is a manifestation i believe in a corporal coming come on a physical coming right right and i know brother brown could see he said it this way he said he'd be so visible among us that he raised the dead and we'd go into rapture okay right but that's still not corporal that's not physical i seen you and i yeah but see the book of revelation shows jesus christ and where he's at and it shows his working in the church all right he doesn't like it for us to find out who we are right he don't like it all right now watch now let's get to number four at you know three go to number four because satan doesn't like this at all you don't want you to see this place 15 church books now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts now brother dale we we ain't nothing like the book of acts would black bear we don't let book of acts no but you don't want they wouldn't want to come down here where we're at and swap places with us they had pharisees and sadducees and a couple of herodians or something to put up with in the book of acts we got 969 that was a long time ago 69 different denominations and 2 000 denominations in this message i just a small number they said well we're a million followers of this message today thank god i thank god for every one of them he said well that's firm off your other flock well 1 million is a whole lot less than 7 billion so it would be fear not little flock if there was over a million going to rapture right that would still be and i can't even count that high can you i remember when we were from school they told us you'd take one dollar bills i forgot what the room was like a 12 to 12. and it took a million one dollar bill to lay them in and fill the room up you know boy thought back then you know who'd ever be a millionaire now you can have a million dollars today broke tomorrow right billionaires now what are they going to trillion what is in words we talking about the other day 10 mozillians we were trying to figure out what they were how many billion it takes to make a zillion how many are always trying to figure something on it but think about it church god is trying his best to get you and i see who we are he designated one whole book now surely we can understand that the gospels was written about the bride of christ paul and them writing peter and them and all the writing would about the bride of christ right but the book of revelations is a personal book that shows you and i and where we act and i like what he said see and i'll get through that if i have time just in the message if you don't we'll get to it wednesday now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts i've told you before when two brothers were said talking one time we were hunting and one of them said that the holy ghost wouldn't you didn't have no baptism with the holy ghost now and the other one said well the day i got the baptism from the holy ghost i fully adopted manifested son i said well one of you is on one end of the ladder on the other end of the ladder i'm going to try to stay in the middle somewhere no and i'm in it and i tried to express it brother brown said he met people who received the baptism of the holy ghost he said exactly like the day of pentecost now that's what your prophet said you see people say oh no the holy ghost ain't here well now right here what did he say christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts yes see we got the wrong way like my wife years ago she made a good point about it and i like to make the emphasis see it wasn't the the holy ghost that would be down in the ages you have no such thing as the holy ghost never age every age had the baptism in the holy ghost it was a word that was eat down it's the word to be restored right come on put it in the right order look but the book of acts shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it now what's it doing making it look warm formal did i say something wrong coming to the church in the father making it look warm formal and powerless all right it exposes satan revealing his works what is revealing satan's work attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word all right right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and what she can do the greater works she will be an invisible army all right if they get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church now what's too spiritual me oh well that's the devil and god that's good that's good but just don't push them so far apart right see because that antichrist that white horse rider was so deceptive in the line of christianity we would call him until it deceived everybody until the prophecy came right the church that started out being the persecuted wound up being the persecutors but everybody's still going to heaven you know they're going to do away with hell if you read that they don't have to do away with because everybody going every time you go to a funeral they preach them to heaven well he got his place in hell and he cut this place again that's all right i hope they do i don't mind doing a little work if we don't spread it out i wouldn't mind but i just know it ain't gonna happen but look now get a true revelation of the two spirits that antichrist spirit is so close there is not but one thing you can deal with it about and the prophet of god said it's whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word now greece means more than just agree that's right like i said this morning people agree and they say brother random brought us the grace of marriage and divorce and bless god i'm free i had three wives but now i don't have none i'm free and all this and the other but you know i just don't agree with his teaching no that's about as carnal as i can think about anything be if you're going to believe what he said on one thing why can't you believe it on another one all right now but see the two spirits see all the churches around the world how many what would you call how many um professing christians i remember at one time this is 20 30 years ago there was 500 million catholics i remember that but i remember reading i said 20 years ago how many uh so-called christians would it be today just a number one billion or seven would that be okay but you realize 1 billion would be a lot of people and everybody's going to heaven and everybody's going to be the bride right the badges of methodist telecasters the brown whites the luau eyes i don't ever mind saying i ain't preaching nowhere today i'm preaching to louise trying to get us converted to be christians but you see the two spirits yes how do you know that that's the holy spirit that's talking to you right how do you know you know how to try it you can't try it by looking somebody out of that girl penical pentecostal well look you know your spirit's not too good don't go up yeah i got a headache no what about it i've heard god speak times that said a moment ago and sometimes it's sweet and sometimes it's not i've told you this and i've always told it because i tell it for his honor i was driving down the road one day and and a voice told me that when you pass that corner there'll be a beautiful woman standing there washing the car this is clear been better if you you know how to believe it quicker for the college been sitting in trouble around i said how do you know i turned around that corner looked over and i stood up a girl washing a car in a bikini i said satan get out of here he's oh no that was god talking to you brother dale no no because he would have told me some other things about that woman should have been him do you know the difference we've got the message to check what somebody's teaching right well brother so-and-so says it's this way that's those deceiving spirits well the prophet ordained him like a brother used to say it you know boy everybody used to run around wanting to know well i'm just mean enough and i got here faking enough i guess to ask but this brother used to go about the country preaching brother brown told me what to preach and i'm going to preach it well everybody what did you tell it brother well he told him a secret because at one time they believed he was one of the thunders do you remember that when they had the seven thunder messages they had seven men named off each one of them was to be a thunder and this was one of them well i happen to be sitting in his home a little bit with him and i just asked him what did brother branham tell him he said he told me to preach hell hot i said we're good everybody else thought it's some kind of mystery i found out what the mystery was he told me to preach hell is that hot but listen church you don't try a spirit by some form or your feelings or ideas mother brother around emphasize the two spirits in the framework of the church he said now let's don't go with it in a way you know see we could look at it like and say well well boy i tell you what i can really see that that antichrist down there in that pope because he's demanding them people worship him you know but that's easy to see forgot to be more deceiving than that remember my illustration a moment ago when god moves up satan moves up right god moves up satan moves up all right so when god come in the last days through the opening of the word satan comes right in there and he said attempted destruction of god's word we just read all right what about the people of this message destroying this message preachers i'm talking about i'm not talking about it you ain't never have trouble control the preachers and this is what it is men take a lot of time and people give you there's a man up north of yonder that believes we're going to get a another body to think this body redeemed and he'll quote brother branham more than i do but it's twisted you can do that how do you know what i'm telling you is the truth well brother that we have confidence in you a lot of people say they got confidence in the pope i'm sure they don't want to follow him do you have the holy spirit amen the only way i know ain't gonna get to it but the only way that you'll ever know anything about god in his ways is to have the holy spirit that's the qualification and then why would why would ministers in this message say you don't have the holy spirit you're just anointed with it or something destructing destructing you know destroying god's word right think about it the two spirits so we'll just stand on this part right here the two spirits so close together pull that back up brother joining finish reading it then we'll quit of the two spirits think about it so close until the bible said it would deceive the very elect if possible now here's whatever i thought oh but that can't be deceived now i know that quote but you won't dare quote this one brother brown said frankly it would get the true church so messed up he'd have to cut to work short now you want that quote oh i can't be deceived i got the holy ghost i spoke in tongues when i got it no no no we don't believe in that one well i believe the prophet what's the difference what's the difference in speaking in tongues or believing the prophet what's the difference in what's the point you want to make say i believe the prophet i believed the prophet for two years and while i was studying in this message for two years and i was a deacon at 23 years old so you know i must have been honored pretty well and i was teaching adult sunday school classes which was the deacons and elders when i left the baptist church at about 20 27 26 but you see i when i seen what broke around was talking about the holy spirit i said immediately i don't have that holy spirit it wasn't my life because i didn't smoke i didn't drink i didn't run around i didn't do anything a lot of it was with self-control and i didn't do it but when i saw what he was talking about holy spirit and a person that would come and live in me i knew i'd talk to that person and i'd seen that person before because i told you about i seen him when i was 11 years old standing in a church but i never made that my experience of the new birth well you believe the message i've had preachers tell me that well so does the devil does that make him save will you such a great you can quote someone can my computer you certainly don't have it because it messes up on me i have to get these brothers out come on while they go richard and the chain went out and i didn't forgot to fix it where the the printer would work and i thought come on brother benny i got enough of them around here i just ought to come on one of you straighten this business out cause i can't do it and don't have the holy ghost the holy ghost is the only hope says as an individual person that you and i have to keep satan from destroying us look what he says if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church look and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit all right satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely courted and said according to boarded today as when christ withstood his ever effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with the true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against it but we will prevail over them get a revelation of the two spirits and they're definitely not out there they're in this message right here claiming the message and i'm not against anybody you know better name you have heard me know better than that you've been here with me i'm not against anybody no you can believe your big toe is god if you want to i'm honest because you don't believe something yeah well i believe it's the big toe but just don't ask me to kiss it i said only thing i'm saying don't ask me to believe i was in a meeting one time and this great man if i called his name everybody know him brother calling him sitting there and that brother said brother brown said so-and-so said now you raise your hand if you were different with me or want to know something too and they said all right brother dale i said brother didn't say that he said yes he did see that's where a lot of people rejected yes he did i said no he didn't i said here's what he said this other brother there was a well-known brother in the message he called that man's name he said brother dale is right right around him didn't say that well i'll say it i said continue on you say what you want to just don't say right around said it in front of these people here that don't know he didn't say it when i went to the philippines i cried the two soul doctrines and the things i hadn't filtered through the philippines see they didn't have any quotes in the message to defend it they were at the mercy of the best that they could do because they were trying to believe brother brown was a prophet people go away it's like that man said brother said so and so what is his big name and i one time i did cry because this brother said you know what to do said here we talk about peter paul james and john he said when you go to the foreign fields and and all like that he said they talk about you know big names in this message not cry if that's all those people in you they were at the mercy of those people but everyone said i'll be glad when the church gets to the place if they stand up and say paul didn't say that if i don't say it the way the prophet i'm talking about not quote verbatim to work you know that every word has got to be perfect i'm talking about if i don't stay with what he said come and talk show me i may not agree with you i may not turn down you know and just fall down and i've been hit like that with people telling me things and i don't just fall over dead because i don't believe it but the lord ever reveals to me i'll do it but you know what i'll do i'll come right back out here to the next service and i'll call your name and say you come to my office and showed me where i was wrong now if you want to believe what he's saying her saying who's saying or what's to say you go right ahead this is what i'm going to say until the lord tells me differently then when he tells me i'll be glad to tell because i'm not the final authority the lord jesus christ is but think on these signs the book of revelation come on music the book of revelations is your book your name you want to know your name read it and to the church of lady of sin i'm not a lady of siam well where are you at where's the age you're in lady of sin was a license there's not another church agent where are you at right but you see people can scream and holler but yet can they sit down and talk about the word did you see the book of revelations is my book my name is in the book brother branham what did he say he said now armand devils not written in the book right he said well what is to take place in the day that arma devil is upon the earth is written in the book you know what that puts his name in it what about let's stand together think on these things the book of revelations can be understood satan don't want you to understand it because it shows his origin and it shows his destruction it shows what he's trying to do he's trying his best to twist this message to get people to worry that they don't believe it i rejoice the other day most of you know about it i wouldn't know i don't know if it probably does work brother attacked up in jeffersonville you know and they put it on the news media and you know everything i thank god that the two men that they got a hold of and what they say that's right an old brother weber college sitting there he said this message is not about william brown this message is about jesus christ i rejoice amen why because if it got a hold of some of these kooks what would it be bad enough right but what would it mean if they'd got a whole truck yes sir we believe he was almighty god we believe man we we believe it we put our whole life on the different god you know they're sincere though i'll never i don't throw off on nobody because you know what you wouldn't but the holy spirit you and i'd be just as deceived right we'd be in the same case if anybody else oh no not me oh yeah you these just don't work out let's find ourselves in the book and then we can glory in it okay what we got right craig and man clean hearts 539 the sperm i'm 39 anybody has within me from we're within me david said restoring to me the joy of god because he knew he didn't have any it was god's salvation read it looking for yourself oh do you have the holy spirit according to my bible no man by the spirit of god can call jesus curse you can't call him jesus christ except by the way holy spirit you heavenly father i am i love you wow we something special no look what
