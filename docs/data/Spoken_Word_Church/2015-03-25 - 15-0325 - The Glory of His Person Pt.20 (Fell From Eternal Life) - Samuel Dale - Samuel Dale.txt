back with us tonight and everything prayed the lord would touch him and all of these others that are sick and things and missing we pray the lord would bless amen father we thank you for your grace your love your understanding thank you for being you and we pray that you would just bless each and every one of us with your presence and your love and lord that we may follow in your footsteps and walk in the light of the gospel as it comes forth to each one of us forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness help us to walk in you as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and our lives and just have your way with each and every one of us remember the sick among us you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe it and we thank you guide each and every one and keep us in jesus name amen revelations 1 12. and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle now we go over to genesis jumping from genesis from revelations on the way back to genesis all right genesis 2 we'll start reading seven through nine and then we'll skip and jump over to uh verse 17 and then we'll go on to the uh chapter 3. and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground may the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the eye and good for for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil now jump just over to verse 17 and says you know that they could eat of every tree verse 16 you know and all i can but what but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat us thereof thy shall surely die now then we go over to chapter three and the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of ever tree of the garden the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it let neither shall you touch it lest you die for god know it that in the day you eat thereof even your eyes shall be opened excuse me therefore your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as god's knowing good and evil and the woman when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave someone to her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made them aprons now then you go on to the rest of it we won't get into the rest of that part tonight so we'll just do that so you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now we have been dealing with the what we call the fall the doings the the uh life we've dealt with bringing into being you know mankind and the uh the things that has to be and all like that and now we're getting to the point of talking about and how for the past two or three services about what happened in the garden and we know that uh mankind are a person you know it says he breathed into the nostrils of adam and he became a living soul all right then we know that mankind according to uh james 2 and 26 says he's or excuse me first thessalonians 5 and 23 it speaks of spirit body and soul and knowing that man is a triune being you know of the body of the spirit and the soul all right but then we've tried to cover that what happened in the garden was the fact of you know the unbelief that came into the mind of eve to where the things would take place later and most everybody deals with the the things that took place but yet we're trying to deal with it as a lineup to get to the position because what took place is an attribute it's just like uh that you know smoking drinking gambling things is not uh sin that's an attribute of unbelief it it's just you know it's just something that's displayed all right so then we know and we've tried to cover and trying to get to a point of talking about us in that triune being and looking back directly we're trying to be in you've got a body which has see taste field smelling here you have a second realm of you that we'll cover it in a minute that when you're talking about the spirit it's got memory reason conscious affections etc in it and then the the center realm of mankind it has only one sense it's either faith or doubt one of them is controlling us and in charge all right and taking those realms we want and have tried to cover how that like it says about eve in thessalonians there that you know that uh lest you be deceived i believe it dawson corinthians yeah i got it written down but anyhow through satan and his septility all right then talking about mankind to see what took place i'm trying to approach it from the position to where that we can see what took place back there all right and not to just read or to think about but to try to break it down into our rim today and think about a body a spirit soul of mankind all right then the body without the spirit according to james two is dead so we can annihilate that part of the body and leaving it to where that the body only displays the uh unbelief you know the things and that would be the attribute that would be what would be bothering you is the attribute part all right and we you know and most everybody deals with just that part without thinking about what caused eve to do wrong and then in what position or what thought it was that you know that she would do uh as she done and i tried to get you from one thing to keep in mind this point whatever happened to eve and adam in the garden has been happening to mankind all the way from that time all right you know from that day that that started it set into motion uh the problems that we have in life the the death the sorrow the heartaches the troubles all came because of mankind and what he done back there when he disbelieved god and and went after his own ideas all right and see then if we look at that and it said we see eve and what happened with her we can see what's happening to us or if we see what's happening to us we can see what happened to her all right because that'll bring it all out in the open and we won't have to be uh wondering you know or or trying to uh figure out and just say well it was just this it was just unbelief well that's true now it was unbelief but unbelief had a display an attribute all right so we know that you know and we know that's what caused the problems back there but we don't blame adam and eve for our problems right since you and i are free moral agents just as well as adam and eve were placed there as free moral agents to choose all right and then when they chose wrong see that's where things went wrong well we don't blame them because of us being wrong because once we reach the age of accountability and we start in our own selves we start thinking reasonings and and things starts working and then out through the human parts of us the body and things starts displaying those things as we begin to develop all right and seeing it then knowing that what happens it says to say to eve is the same thing that's happening to you and i'm sorry but yet if we get so super religious so uh greatly live being something you know well of course we don't think there's anything wrong with us you know we think that we're oh nothing's wrong with me i'm a christian well that's why i cover the things the way i do and how thank god that we have had a prophet that we at least claim to be the one that uh brought the word to us and and by that then we can at least claim the point of saying well whether i understand it or not i've i i do have an ability now to to place things in the right perspective by god sending us a profit and doing it in that way and that way we we don't have to you know we don't then uh we're not like saying well what's your thoughts you know what do you think happened well i think it was this well that's all right but i think it was this well you can go along all your life trying to figure out what you're thinking about you know your thoughts and ideas but see we at least claim to have the message to bring out those things to where that we can can say this is what it means we might not have known what before but now we have the message to check things with and wonder why and see in doing it then as i keep saying it whatever happened to eve in the garden that's the same thing don't get it just this happen here and then we go away over here and we we don't have no problems you know no whatever happened there whatever started there is still in motion today amen satan desired to enter himself into the human race is that true that was his purpose of causing to fall well he didn't stop because he couldn't achieve it in the way that he desired maybe he's still trying today and today you can see that he has the biggest portion of the religious world under his control into the line of his thinking you know and and in order to show you then it's still here whatever took place there is still here you know because that's that's the point of what we're we've got to look at and not just blame adam and eve and oh we can't help it we're just this away yeah we can blame them all we want to but that won't do any good that's right all right trying to get that thought into our minds well we know the message we do you know the message you know i mean you know do you just is your part of the fall just you know even the beast and something that took place and we were glad we've got that straightened out you know well worth satan today see that would have ended back there but it didn't end back there it just started back there and see now it's the church that he's trying to deceive amen he's already got the center right the sinner's already on the realm of satan or in his domain or you know doings but he's trying his best to conquer the church the bride of jesus christ all right and he has done a good job because as we may quote the prophet is to say that none of us are a match for the devil right i don't care how spiritual you think you are how revelated you think you are that's the words of the prophet he said no person today is a match he said the holy spirit is a match for the devil but not you and i so then we've got to depend on him for the answer not just what we think is right or already is or going on and think that it's doing it and where is it today in the biggest realm does it not speak of satan as him having uh ministers preachers which say all right that are trying their best to deceive well it's always like i like to say it and people don't like for me to just be plain some people has even rebuked me for making blunt statements but you think you're a match for the devil you're already deceived you think you can handle this thing you're already deceived don't worry about getting deceived and like i tell you you know i said well brother dale i was doing pretty good until you started preaching on this and now i'm confused well i didn't confuse you you mean to tell me you don't want the truth see if we're deceived we don't know we're deceived now the bible says adam understood what he was doing all right adam wasn't deceived but eve was deceived now her being deceived she thought she was right right and brought around said that's the way it is today the people still think they're right all right the churches think they're right now you don't you know of any church has got a sign put out in front we're all wrong trying to find truth you ever seen one i've been a long country quite ways and a few foreign countries and i haven't read that sign yet it's always come to us we have the truth you know go up on lake lanier and they'll put up a sign up there says come as you are and they do in their bikinis and everything else they come to church as they are sit on the side of the lake in their boats and listen to the preacher while they slip on their liquor and sort of stuff you know come as you are you know just be a part of us everything's all right have you have you read lately of anybody going to hell there's been a lot of funerals probably priest today and i dare say they probably wouldn't have one of it that the preacher ever said this fellow is going a woman or whatever's going to hell no so that's a pretty big deceiving thing right see that's where paul said let satan tempt you through his septility as he did eve see now where did he enter the rim to talk to eve we tried to cover that last wednesday remember that he looks at her and he's trying to figure some way to enter into the human race in any way he can because he knows he cannot create so when he looks he tries to look her over and try to find a way and he finds eve and adam with eternal life in their soul see that was a lot we didn't know right but that's according to blasphemies nines and we'll read some more in a little bit that they had eternal life in their soul so there was no way satan could enter the soul of adam and eve and be able to deceive them all right so that leaves the realm of the body and the spirit well the body without the spirit is dead so you take that out now you've taken out two realms of mankind and you can only be dealing in the spirit realm the spirit realm is what memory reason conscience and you know affections love and things right right whereas for the body it's see taste field smelling here that just deals with what we're doing out here the soul has only one sense either faith or doubt not two it's not faith and doubt being in there are two souls like the people of the message want to believe that you have two souls you know god give you one the devil give you one well you know i never didn't know where the devil could create i thought that was what we claimed the messenger to be saying but in doing that now we look at the points of man and we find then that there was one place that satan is trying to deal with wednesday night real heavily he found that point of her memory reason now remember she didn't have no memory of something that had taken place so he had to start right there in the realm of that doings you know all right now remember that she didn't have memory reason conscience he had to start dealing with that and no tell how telling how long he dealt with her in them realms before he began to get her to really reason so remember then we're in worse shape right because we're born in that memory reason conscience by the time the child reaches the age of accountability it already has its own memory reason conscious affections and things dealing within that body of that person so where is it that mankind where is it that adam and eve sinned at not in soul not in body amen but in their spirit realm all right then the effects came out into the body yeah that's the attribute that's the display it came on out into the body but they still had the eternal life in their soul all right now see that's where i said we didn't know it and people on the internet don't know it but on blasphemy i don't i don't say that don't know it most of them don't know okay because they don't read they don't study they don't listen to the prophet's message they just read what they want to read and skip over the rest of it but brother brown emphatically states in blasphemous names that god breathed into the nostrils of adam and he became an eternal soul all right then he goes on to say that god specially upon now don't try to run any special if you're doing your computer won't come up foot special s-e-s-e-s-p-e-c-i-a-l-l-y because see i tried that for a long time one day and didn't find that i didn't find it especially you know all right he said but god especially upon adam breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with god amen all right now we went through wednesday especially covering that adam was in eve in the spiritual creation so then adam would have been even in excuse me he was in adam in the spiritual creation so then in the physical creation eve would have been in adam in the physical all right now in doing that then we don't try to make a byproduct as what mankind wants to make it is something bad the only thing you find in brother branham and i will to state this fact and let it go the only thing you find brother branham talking about the woman as the difference is the fact of in the dogs and the cats it's for the motherly reproduction whereas the woman it's for anytime she desires now that's all you'll find but it's did god make her that way i mean did he form her with some inability or some imperfection in her body i was get away from that if i were you because remember in the spiritual multiplication we go to church daily and study god's word it's just not ever nine months okay can i end that there with the thought in your mind that you know what i'm talking about if you don't raise your hand i'll cover it i just try not to be so blunt to wake you thinking or you know of the wrong thoughts but now think about it so then eve sinned even adam sinned in their spirit not in their body not in their soul so word is a christian now a sinner is all the way sin he's condemned on a higher level sin is not even counted to him why because he's a sinner he's lost right so his body his spirit his soul his entire makeup his sin when the prophet said a sinner don't sin he said because he's just a sinner he's dead all right but see then a christian then we have to get into that debate that's been in mankind for probably since the beginning in in uh the book of acts as to how does a christian sin you know they don't say i've got the quote i've got the quote well amen i gave it to you where brother branham said it's impossible absolutely impossible for a christian to sin all right turns right around and says i sin every day well i guess he was saying he wasn't a christian you see i don't mind being carnal you know what i mean if you're gonna quote cardinal to me i'm quote carnal to you but if we're going to try to talk on sensible things we leave it alone the prophet said i sin every day but where did he sin from where does a christian sin from that was my whole point and i don't want to lose that point i don't want to leave that point i want you to realize it that a christian cannot sin with their body because it doesn't work and you cannot sin from the eternal soul because that would make sin in the soul and that won't work and that's why this bible says that his seed remaineth in us and we cannot sin all right the prophet's writing what he said it's impossible for a true christian born again believer to sin from their soul their being their person that they are because they're eternal and there's no way to make that soul to do wrong all right then there's no way that the body does anything because it's not it's useless without the spirit to operate so where does the christian sin from where did the prophet mean that he sinned every day in his memory reason conscious affections the second part of him that we would call then now the spirit part all right and just to try to show you then you know that's what i tried to do wednesday was to try to show the part that you know if we don't understand brother branham and what he's saying then you can make him say anything you want to that's right i gave you the quotes wednesday night like from blasphemy uh uh greatest battle ever fall where brother branham was talking about eve sinning in her soul go back to your quotes on those things of you sinning in her soul well if she send in her soul then that would be eternal life sin and if her soul was eternal so now you're going to back up away from her being eternal because you don't want to stay with that all right but see then if you'll just go back to where he was and keep in thought in mind of what a i've taught you for 40 something years that brother branham in his early ministry would say three realms of mankind triune being of mankind body soul spirit now sometimes in there he would swap that part in his disgusting or preaching and he he will use it but he would say eve begin to reason all right where's reasoning at the second realm of mankind no matter what you call it so then when he comes over to the opening of the word which would fulfill the scriptures right hebrews 4 12 says the word is a divider between the joint and the mirror and the soul and spirit so i'm not saying he was wrong i'm saying that he didn't have to come and preach sermons upon correcting what he was doing because he had said that all along he'd always gave the outside man see taste filled smelling here he always gave the second realm no matter if he called it spirit or he called it soul he gave it the memory the reason the consciences and the things and he always gave i gave you the quotes wednesday on it like i said you go to to the greatest battle ever fault and listen to him and there's what he's saying then you jump over to where we were in uh works his faith expressed in 1965 and he brings it out into this body spirit and soul so it came because of the opening of the word hebrews 4 and 12. when the word opened to the prophet in the times of the seals and the coming through you'll see him coming to lining those things up but he didn't have to preach on it why because he had always preached it correctly as far as the rims and the senses of the rims so he didn't have to re-preach it but that way you can take what you want to you know because that's the way mankind does see your two-soul people will not quote you a quote after 1963-4 about soul spirit and body and things like that no no they'll quote you every one of them and the oh where it's body soul and spirit and then they'll give you two souls and they got quotes but just remember if the bible is correct and if the prophet was the prophet he would have had to had the perfect interpretation as he said with divine vindication of the word of god then ezekiel see why this wednesday night i just quit because you know you go so far but ezekiel says what i give you a new heart and i give you a new spirit he says then i put my spirit in you and how did brother brown explain now he said he gave you a new heart he said that's a different thinking take away the stony heart that was you know hateful arrogance and things pulling away some of those things but said then i give you a new spirit he said that's not the holy spirit that's right all right did he take your spirit out you know if he took your spirit out then you would lose all your memory reason conscience and things of that person that you was so it's not saying that away what it's a reworking of that spirit it's cleansing that spirit it's bringing that spirit because he said i put my spirit in you he said now that's the holy spirit now that'll line up with five senses of the body five senses of the spirit and one sense of the soul that'll line right up with ezekiel it'll line right up with the quotes of the prophet it'll all be correct remember what he says he says our english language is so messed up he said till i say well bored he said you know that can be uh i'm bored with you you know and i gave more illustrations a little bit to it see because you can say i'm bored with you come on board this ship stand on that board because i'm bored with you you got a lot to do with board but the before and the after explains it right see we wonder how the prophet got the the things of saying that adam that uh abraham and sarah would turn back to a young man and a young woman you know we'll go read the before and the after before they were well stricken in the age does that what it said all right then after the kingdom wants sarah for a wife the before and after answers the question keep reading you got a question keep reading it'll come out to where you'll get to a correct understanding right now and try to pick up now where we left off dealing with wednesday night because i know this is i said wednesday and i know that when i speak i've done it for so many years maybe i do try to speak by just something that that i know and you know and been at it so long and i'm sorry that i'll leave you dangling sometimes but go back and pray about it and listen how many of you says i don't understand what brother dale said but i ain't listening to that again well you know it just might be if you listened again one thing you might catch it two things i wouldn't have to repeat it so much right don't brother dale does a lot of repeating right my brother donnie is always told brother donny's daddy brother tom always told him he said brother dale kind of preaches a little bit around on the morning and said in the evening he backs up and re-preaches and goes home you know but i want you to see who you are because it's not to realize what happened in the garden like i told you my daddy told my mother i don't claim him to be a prophet or anything like that i don't know where he ever even confessed christianity i'm telling you i don't know but she read the bible to him one time in genesis he couldn't read and he told her what happened and she tried his best to tell him it was an apple he laughed at her he was a bachelor before he got married i guess he knowed a whole lot and he's 45 years old when he got married all right but listen church what is it why is it so hard to preach the truth a lie is easy to preach a false doctrine is easy to preach you can just go every which way with it and it don't matter people will follow you but you try to preach the truth and you demand that people think about what you're saying you know to consider it now we're going to get to that eventually when we get to the new birth because remember you're going to have to go through those senses of spirit to get born again it's not that god just swoops and plops something down within you and or i was born with this seed in me and all i needed to do was just find out that i had it no it won't work too good see we're going to deal with how does god get through your memory your reason your conscience he has to come that way to speak to you all right and listen if you would read and listen to the prophet and listen to what i say a lot of time you know that brother brown talks about it let's see what message it in he talks about the flus is it the greatest battle ever fought where he talks about the flus he said that's what got stopped up with eve the flus you know what you know about the flu it's like you got an old boiler and it's got flus and it's got things in it less off pressure do anything it see us memory reason conscious affections those are the flus that god has to clean out to even save us and you'll find out eventually maybe why there's not too many what did the prophet say genuine new verse i mean that's what he said he said there's not very many genuine new verse because satan is still working through that all i'm doing now is trying to get the emphasis laid down of this is eve and this is what happened all right and what happened to her is happening to me and you and been happening now for 6 000 years in mankind right you see i would listen you know and try to understand but all right getting to the point kind of where we left off because i i i made the statement and i i don't mind making statements about things because i want to be right and i want to help be helped for number one but i i want you to understand what i'm talking about and you know we talked a lot last wednesday about blasphemous names where brother branham was covering that adam god breathed into his nostrils the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with god all right now that was not in his body because his body was a creation all right now that was not in his spirit as we talk about the second realm of mankind the memory reason conscious affections etc because that would not have been eternal it was this god permitting that to exist in the human being but it was in the soul of mankind and he became a living soul and i tried to explain it through a lot of things at the prophet because that was what i had to to base it on of bro where brother branham would even cover that even adam was together in theophany and that when adam was put into flesh he was lonely because part of his being was still in theophany all right but see we've got it all figured out we we're so revelated about the theophany until all we got is i got one up in heaven that's that's all we can deal with we don't even consider listen we don't even memory reason consciousness right we got it figured out and i'm not going to take anything else you remember when we believed in the trinity and there was no way for nobody to explain it any different because that's what we believe and we had bible for it her was jesus and there was the there was the dove coming down in the void we had it all kind didn't we but see one day we found out we didn't have the truth i like that scripture it says and you shall know the truth it doesn't say you shall know truth it doesn't say you shall know about truth it says you shall know thee singular truth and the truth will set you free all right i believe this message is the truth right amen but think about it now if part of adam wasn't fully complete upon earth even though he had been given eternal life even though he was there in in in the you know in the garden the full creation of man you know that he was body spirit and soul a human being and that god gave eternal life to him and his soul he became an eternal person with god all right after all of that he was still lonely why because as part of him wasn't there at that time right that was the part of him that would be what we would call eve but she never had that name she never received that name eve until she failed because adam had the 126-27 man has no name to it it's the two six or seven that he forms him from the dust of the earth and then he comes on down later and names him adam because it means the beginning or the red man that starts you know we do it and eve means the mother of all living well she couldn't have that name until she became the mother of all living she was woman part of adam you know right all right but part of him was missing and then when that part was put into he took a rib from from adam and he gave that a flesh and he gave it a spirit and a soul of a being to live you know making it a triune being and then he breathed into the nostrils of eve and she became an eternal person with god all right i made the statements because like i said i try to be honest that i couldn't find any statements talking literally of eve but i took it from the scriptural point of the fact of christ in the church and the things of that and taking it from eve still being in theophany and adam already put into human flesh and then bringing forth eve into being well we went outside and wade found this one so let's go ahead and read this one let's see what brother branham said on go to number three brothers which is why some people can't keep the victory 1957 327 e77 look what he says there was no harm could come the tiger laid down the line that the leo the line laid down nothing would harm then alone came sin brother it's for that beautiful picture eve would have never needed max factor to fix her cosmetic face no sir it was god the very blush of eternal life in her made her beautiful amen so now i've got the quote from the prophet so i'll quote him with it i was quoting it from my own right okay and didn't mind telling you that was what i was doing i could have flagged you and tried to make you think i know what i was talking about but see now i do i don't have to worry about it she would never have to have manicures and everything like that they do today sin is what brought you to that place all right now think about it i did have these quotes you see it that one i don't have to worry about it because it's a direct quote see it ain't something you got to presume because it says the very blush of eternal life in her made her beautiful all right see i had these and i'll give you some more after a while but go ahead to number four which is what shall i do with jesus call christ in 1963 11 24 paragraph 188 would be where you come down to it look he was keeping her in eternal life as long as she stayed with that word when she broke that word she had the promise of god that she would die the day that she broke it and when she broke it she died that's right i had those quotes and another i'll give you in the seal book in a minute but i'm talking about i like those words i don't have to worry about it and and you got the problem to where i can just read it and say that she had the blush of eternal life all right why wouldn't we believe that because we she's supposed to be a type of the church and i thought the church that we believed it had eternal life all right and she was that eternal life was keeping her in the right place as long as she was staying in that right place behind the word all right but when she becomes separated and put into a form of a flesh and began to walk away from that word because of her part that satan began to work through which would have been her spirit realm then she begins to accept satan's lie all right did the prophet say you don't have to worry about that old guy with the overall dome with your wife it's that slick tongue guy and let me put that slick tongue preacher let me put that other word in there that's the guy that's doing the deceiving as i said a while ago because satan's got his preachers right and they were even called as ministers of righteousness you know that in the scripture about satan and his angels see satan don't want to bring up something that's not righteous he's just trying to put his hand into it like i said he don't go to the juke joints the liquor hogs and the things today he's in church he was the anointed cherub that stood beside the lord he loves he was over the worship part right he loves to go to church he loves to hear good music and good singing you know why because he was created that way standing beside the lord he doesn't want to don't want to garbage cans i mean he wants to be in church with the people he wants you to be in church right he don't want you to stay at home the devil made me stay at home no he didn't he wants you to go because he wants to go with you you know what okay you say well brother dale you shouldn't be okay i shouldn't be but i am forgive me but is it the truth okay all right no problems right it's the truth satan wants to go to church and have a good time do you think let me just put this in here as a personal thought do you think he really wanted to enter the human race as just some way of doing things or would it really be the truth to say that he wanted the human race to worship him right which one do you think right well i know what the prophet said said that was the only way because he could enter the human race because by entering human race see that's where he gets worshipped from the human but really is it not so just what i say it that he wants worship he wants people to believe he is god to be as god's wasn't that what he told eve knowing good and evil all right and the bible speaks of the god of this evil age he wants worship and brother branham may i quote him as to say he said you can call him jesus jesus and worship the devil okay well i i know who i'm worshiping do you do you really know who you worship well he's that sweet thing that comes to me that's i know i got got in trouble trying to explain that but i'll do it again try to help you it ain't always a sweet voice that god speaks with sometimes he says sit down shut up and listen it ain't that sweetness oh you're so wonderful you're so great remember that's the way he got to eaves that's the way he got to her with that beautiful slick tongue right what you say what brother dale you mean you believe that a a christian can do wrong we'll read a little bit more i want you to think but i'm sealed in satan can't get into me i'm glad you thought of that because remember the prophet says it this way you say the devil come and got me go ahead with number seven well they're getting there i'll read on it says no he never you went out to him now he is not explaining that you have eternal life in your soul and eternal life in your soul goes out to the devil now if that's what you think you really do need a brain transplant he talking about so the bible says you're dead your life is hidden in god through cross sealed by the holy ghost how could the devil get you you went out that's right devil never got you you went out now we're not talking about going out and doing hideous outlandish things because anyone ought to know the difference in that but what about it look at the next one number eight which is questions and answers 1954. and he's talking about backsliding and every day i do if i do that now listen to what he's saying now we was talking on the word backsliding this morning when you do that your backslid yes sir you got to repent is that right now i don't mean to say if you went out in the world and did this and that but you've done something you've got to repent and die daily to live in jesus christ so every day every day you've got to die every day to live in christ now is that just what i said you backslide you got to repent i don't mean to say you went out in the world and you did this and that you didn't go out in the world and do the harl you know the hard things the no no you just backslid my definition is backsliding is one thing if you're standing still you're backsliding now hi brother dale i've been standing still for a long time i've been standing still you're backsliding because god's moving in the days of martin luther when the just shall live by faith was wonderful but one day wesley preached sanctification and you just stood still in your justification what did it become denominational because god's moving the pillar of fires never stopped my brother around said he liked the way paul was he said he wasn't satisfied no one place he said he was constantly moving well the holy spirit don't stop in one place it may have said a day or two there in the old testament where they camped around there but the first thing you know is up moving all right you say but i can't backslide no if you're with that attitude you can't i'm gonna agree with you if you're that attitude not sarcastic about it that you can't do it i'm going to agree with you because you never was saying start with if that's the way you think if you think you can't do nothing wrong but yet you know you do well it wasn't me as that devil made me do it now remember the prophet said you went out that you went out satan can't get in because you're sealed right but you can certainly go out into his realm and if you think you don't then i'm going to tell you to start with your lost you need to get some salvation where you'll begin to find out you do and can do wrong but i've never heard nobody preach like that well where have you been the prophet said we sin every day the prophet said we do wrong the prophet said i done wrong did i told my wife not big things he said i told my wife it wasn't three great men right one of them was born in kentucky which was he's talking about himself right you know what she kind of let him have it you know what he didn't say a thing he went repented but you see we don't want to admit those things so we want to prop it up by saying that it wasn't me it was the devil made me do it well you got him pretty close to you then if he made you do it right right he's pretty close and you know what i'm as honest as i can be about it how many has ever heard me make this statement i don't blame the devil for everything i do you may blame the devil you may say the devils when it caused it i don't say that because a lot of things i don't believe the devil would even come up with it to try to get me to do that thing it's me in my memory my reason my conscience my things remember there is the position where lust comes forth because the body cannot lust without the spirit there is the position of a lot of things dealing in that spirit realm that we talk about all right what do you think about it we're constantly trying to get rid of the devil and we need to but maybe someday we need to look straight at our own selves you know what say lord i'm sorry for what i've done there's no need of you trying to beg god to forgive you for something the devil done did that come out right i hope it did do we repent for what the devil made us do getting mighty clothes ain't it we need to repent for what we do wrong thoughts wrong ideas wrong speaking back out of our mouth wrong life but then we want to prop it up and say well well i didn't really do that he was the devil the prophet said you went out he can't get in but now remember though he can get into your spirit and he can get into your body by way of your spirit right it's just he can't it's just that he can't get in your soul because it's sealed in and that soul cannot sin if it's born again because it's sealed in i had some quotes a few one of them maybe at the end where the prophet was talking about the life and the way we do but why worry why not just be sensible why not just think about it in a line that we can see of life and to realize that you and i are dying now if you don't think you are i would invite you to go get some pictures you've got to view when he's about 20 and look at you now you might find out you've been dying a whole lot right now if you think that you cannot sin then if you cannot sin then where would death come involved at what actually happened in the garden that is still controlling you and i tonight brother brandon made some statements about those things but what do we think as i said we take the quotes of where he said body soul spirit we take that and prove a point with it then we take where he says body spirit soul we take that and prove a point with it but do we see that it ties together as i said to were that he was never wrong in what he was saying he was just saying his words different and if you will go into the bible i invite you to do this study the bible a little bit about the word spirit do you know that there is no written definition of spirit now what i mean by that i mean the word spirit has the meaning of what it is yeah but it does not divide between whether it's holy spirit or your spirit well the before and the after is the way you'd find out which one it's talking about in other words you read and it talks about the holy spirit coming on the day of pentecost and it's all about spirit you know what that is that's eternal life but when it's talking about the spirit of man as he reasons that's just the spirit of man see you're gonna have to make a decision upon your own selves it's not that you can just decide well we'll uh i don't understand why brother brown would say this and why he would say that so i'll just try to somehow stay in the middle well the bible says to repent everyone and be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and it says lord jesus christ now which one do you want am i right see anybody that is baptized correctly in the name of the lord jesus christ is baptized according to matthew 28 19 to fulfill that commission your prophet said one day and that's the way i baptize to fulfill the commission that the lord said to baptize this way in matthew 28 19 to do that now i baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ now i have they're not either one both of them are correct both of them are written by men that by the time matthew was written matthew was full of the holy ghost because it wasn't written right while they were doing writing it down it's probably somewhere around 50 years later almost before some of your writings were made and brought into beings and a lot of things if you'd study your bible you might find out all right now if you're a christian a truly born-again christian is it possible for you to ever be lost if you're a true born-again christian because i'll give you the quote if you like it where brother branham said there's no way you could do that he said because what you would be doing he said then you would be putting god in hell and said that won't work he said you can't burn eternally you can burn forever and ever right but you can't burn eternally you'd have to have eternal life to burn eternally so that would put god's own life in hell and you can't do that but sometimes he'll make a statement that you've got to really think about and consider the matter and wait for god to reveal it and our biggest problem is is is one thing is that we you know a lot of people do well that don't matter to me hell no matter where his father's on the holy ghost lord jesus christ long as i'm baptized i'm all right but it don't matter to me whether it's three gods or one god or what long as i get there that's caused a lot of organized religions in the world so you make your choice but can you fall from eternal life then we would have to make and establish the point there would be no way that you could fall from eternal life because if you did you would be falling to hell you know you would be lost of that now when he makes this statement about adam and eve then we've got to analyze the statement that he made to think about it look at what he said happened in the garden go ahead to number nine brother this is taken from the breach between the church ages and seals 63 317. we'll go paragraph 90 through 93 i think it is and when a person is struck with disease aches and pain one time they wasn't that way but they're groaning why they're not right there's something wrong and they're groaning and trying to get back to where they was when they had helped and when nature and people as the bible said are groaning it shows there's something that they're not in their ought to be conditioned they have fallen from somewhere now we don't need anybody to interpret that for us see for of course we have uh for of course we know it was eternal life they had fallen from take that quote go with it now you just shook your head and nodded almost grand amen while ago that you couldn't fall from eternal life i've heard that tried to explain by some i won't call the name that said that they could fall back there but we couldn't fall now no i don't remember he's not an ending giver you need that it's in here he's not an ending giver and he's not different than who he gives it to and takes it away he don't give you something to take it away from you can i quote the prophet he ain't going to save you knowing that you're going to be lost right so now what's he talking about for of course we know it was eternal life they had fallen from and they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of adam and eve who fell from eternal life to death in the garden of eden and brought all nature under them to death now what's he talking about how can you fall from eternal life well i just like this brother dale i'm just going to believe it because prophet said it well the bible says to be baptized father son holocaust it's quiet don't it but you see you say well why do we need to understand these things why do you need to know whether you're singing that if you could ever convince yourself one time that you had sinned since you received the holy ghost and just one time you would realize and think that you're totally lost unless you knew where the sin was coming from that it's coming from the spirit part of you and not the soul now you've got the devil's answer all right so what does he say tree never died before adam let's get to before and after okay an animal wouldn't die before adam there's only one thing that cannot die and that's god because he's eternal that's the only way we can ever keep from dying we have to have eternal life in us to be sons and daughters of god but when we die as i said in the morning message this morning to sin we sold out our birthright and crossed this chasm now we're beyond the reach of god on this other side of the chasm of course when adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation now he was given free moral agency it was given to them just as we so to make a choice now adam and eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them and that sign tree sets before each and and every one of us see god isn't doing for adam or for eve you say well it's their fault no not now it isn't it's your fault you can't place it on adam and eve you got to place it on yourself because right and wrong is set before you we're on the same basis as adam and eve now so we have to and i have to because i'm a minister this brought this topic up and i'm not one of those type of ministers that'll bring up a topic and uh just leave that topic to where that you can think what you want to as a man said one time i despise it when a man asks a question when he's the only one that's got the answer i said i wouldn't have asked it if i didn't have the answer amen because it would have been stupidity to ask the question i didn't have an answer from the man i was talking to and i'm not gonna bring that up but he wound up thinking he was this great prophet and all of these things and you had to go ride some horses with him and getting on some of the digging up some gold plates and things i ain't joking you but what is your thoughts then that brother random said adam and eve fell from eternal life to death what is your thoughts on that now remember i didn't think to bring this one but the prophet said that the tree of life was in the garden to remind adam that his youth was being renewed i'll be glad to find that one somebody can run it in a hurry and then throw it on the screen he said the tree was there to remind adam that his youth was being renewed why because adam's body was not eternal adam's spirit was not eternal it was his soul that was eternal well then did he lose eternal life in his soul i don't think so i make that statement as your pastor as to what you say well brother dale we we're dependent upon you to give us answers to things and i try might not be the right one a lot of times but i do the best i can all right in the context that the prophet is talking about he does not deal with and you read it we'll put it back up and let you read it is not re he is not talking about adam and eve going to hell because the atonement had already been made right it wasn't that you remember the atonement was made for the foundation world so adam and eve could not have been lost and go to hell i can quote a little bit if you like where brother brown said one of these days in the resurrection adam will reach over and get eve he's reach over and get able able reach over and get set and the resurrection will come all right but what is he talking about now is he talking about does he referring any here to the eternal life of adam and soul and eve or is he really talking about the fact that death had not entered the picture at the time of the fall that was the first death right at the time of the fall was the first death whatever you want to make it natural spiritual whatever and he talking about that the trees never died before adam an animal wouldn't die before adam could it be made into a simple conclusion then of what he's just talking about to worry that it would tie matthew 28 19 together with acts 2 38 or would tie together where he would say one day come and let's address the third person of the trinity and then turn around and say there's no such thing in the bible could it be that god is using a man to leave a situation that would become very very uh confusing to mankind because i can take one quote and throw adam and eve in hell i can take another quote and put them in heaven now is that all we need to do it's just a quote or do we need a decision somewhere an understanding a revelation so adam and eve never lost eternal life in their soul but they lost the ability to come forth in eternal life in human flesh that's right consider that point they never achieved what they were set here for they were put here to come forth and bring forth all of us not all mankind but all of the genuine part as we covered the other day would have come forth they would have brought forth that christ as the prophet had to say well did did they lose eternal life in soul or did they lose the ability to bring eternal life into being because remember the scriptures we've read and we read a quote there a moment ago from the prophet talking about it that the tree of life was in the garden as i said to you wednesday night then if sin had not entered the picture you would have still had mankind as a body and a spirit as to be mortal with an eternal soul but yet you could have went to the tree of life and partook of the tree of life because it was in the garden and they could eat of the tree of life before they fail read your bible remember as quick as they fail placed out guard what the way of the tree of life now get back in the garden the way of the tree of life and i remember when i was in the baptist church as a preacher preached a message one day and you know that stuck to me yet go in the bible and read about the way just read about the way just take a concordance and read the way jesus said i am the way the truth and the life and you know that stuck with me till today of thinking about him being the way and remember they were not to guard the garden as we think they were to guard the way of the tree of life that's what your bible says here comes a prophet with a great understanding and he said those angels that were guarding the way of the tree of life are no longer doing that he says they're trying to drive us to that what the way the truth and the life right see adam never failed to be lost but he never achieved what he was put here to do because once we would have all come had there been no fall you could went to the tree of life and made partaker of the tree of life and become eternal in body spirit and soul all right well i thought that's what we're doing now i thought that's what's going on i thought we were supposed to be born again by the baptism of the holy ghost and i thought the tree of life was the word of god that we are now partaking of that will one day make this body and spirit that i am eternal right so really the only difference is just the way it's happening and thank god it's happening so they never lost that they lost the ability to bring it forth let's read number 10. go ahead with number 10. the third seal now notice the natural woman failed and god made a way for her to be redeemed although she had fallen he made a way now that was the first bride on earth fell before her husband and her were married she fell by the reason of reasoning instead of staying with the word she fell and she fell to death watch eternal separation i don't mind putting them in when i know what i'm talking about now before i know what i'm talking about i ain't going to put them in okay look she fell to death eternal separation with her she took her husband and everything else with her on the earth she failed you see eternal separation adam and eve never reached the position they were supposed to have reached so they fell to death and death is eternal separation you realize had god not come in human flesh and made away their death would have been eternal separation but by him coming he ended that stage you ever noticed the scripture that people are bad quote disappointed on the man wants to die everybody says we gotta die it's appointed unto man wants to die have you ever noticed this statement brother branham made he said jesus broke the scriptures he hadn't never read that he broke the scriptures now if he broke the scriptures he's lost now what's he talking about the scripture that said it's appointed unto man wants to die when jesus christ died on that cross that scripture can never be used again it was broken it was fulfilled through the life of christ and lost or taken out of the way so he broke that scripture by fulfilling it as to be life adam and eve never was lost and went to hell they just never achieved the eternal life in body and spirit that way they were meant to be but someday somebody will why don't we contend that we're part of it and believe for it we've been left around here a long time for some reason right so why not just enjoy what's happening and say thank you lord you know let's go on with him come on brothers musicians i hope you listen to what i'm saying because you see a preacher you don't realize what a preacher is and it's not what we choose to be that's why they're true preachers but there's false ones right if a preacher doesn't strive to know the things that has been spoken of by the prophet that seems to be contradictory to one another and he does not strive to have an understanding to teach his people he's not concerned with his people he's only concerned with getting the collection plate when it passes by working now the money right i've spent my whole life studying this message to where the things that seem to be contradictory are beautiful pictures once they unfold but until they unfold they're horrible like a cap and a tree eating green grass you see why i spend my time for that for you to help you understand these things have always been to me like daniel 70 weeks and things he said we don't need to understand brother brown said if you don't understand daniel 70 weeks you cannot understand the seal that's what he said now i'm not the one that made that statement you go in the message of the daniel 70 weeks and you'll find what he says on that if we're not interested in getting out of here in a change of the body what are we interested in you know what do we need what are we here for you know that somebody's here to prove to satan may i quote it that she will not fall like eve did in the garden well she won't fall for his subtility let's stand she won't fall for his deceiving triggering tactics his reasonings and memory of conscience and affections and things that she won't fall for that she will believe god's word what we got brother my for the needs that our brother's asking and we wait on you to bring forth a manifestation we love you father and we thank you in jesus name speaks to me and agree do you sure please come and take control the pool sing it to him and think about it what do you do he was wrong about him we've got to go i feel the pool he's had this old congestion and things and just wave all of us you go through two or three rounds of antibiotics trying your best to help and that still ain't doing no good we need god lord jesus just go to brother take away that problem that's bothering you lord we love you and we thank you in jesus name see why is it now that it's in the respiratory of what you call it the life system it's in the breathing it's in the bronchus trying to cut the life off he's trying to stop us he knows he has just a little season please why because that's where it started at was when the breath of life was breathed into mankind so he's trying his best to fight that breath of life that living that breathing and it's horrible to when you get where you can't breathe it's rough it's it's horrible thank god for things to open our sinuses whatever you call it doing happiness thank god for it because we believe it terrence said sister mary called you remember singing happy birthday she said to tell everybody hello and she loved everybody and thank you very much so sister mary happy birthday thank the lord we believe it just pray for these that are sick satan with the doings and and all and tying up and trying to stop everybody but we know who has the truth right amen think on these things what about it we're facing eternal life the very thing that mankind fell from in the garden he didn't make it to it but somebody will why because jesus christ did he was in a mortal body subject to death his body was not eternal he was in that mortal part yet he come to a change i'm looking forward to that don't you the bible says a body like unto his own glorious body think on these things father we thank you for tonight and we pray that you've blessed and understanding of people and that you'll open our understanding unto you that we may walk in the light of your love and be led lord by your grace and your understanding forgive us of our many sins and lord the things that we in life are human beings and do we ask you to cover us by the blood and lord we know and realize that we've got to have that atonement for our lives as long as we're here mortals and then when we're out of here and not mortal anymore we don't need an atonement and it'll all be taken care of but we need it now because we are here go home with everybody give a safe journey to everybody on the way home and touch the sick among us we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen you just missed well i just want to take a little bit of time and shout glory glory glory lord i just want to little bit of time and shout glory glory glory lord i just wanna take a little bit of time and shout glory glory glory o glory glory glory to the lord
