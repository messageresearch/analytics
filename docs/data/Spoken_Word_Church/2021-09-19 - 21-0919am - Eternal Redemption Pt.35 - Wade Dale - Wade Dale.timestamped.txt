[1:31] if you don't miss it you'll be there but
[1:33] i the prophet of god
[1:36] said that he built it by your desire
[1:38] so whatever desire you have that's what
[1:40] that's the way he built it
[1:43] and he built it
[1:45] for you
[1:47] um
[1:48] now we're going to talk about the
[1:49] millennium
[1:50] where we build and inhabit not us the
[1:52] bride but where the
[1:54] 144 000 and the different ones in the
[1:56] millennium they build houses and they
[1:58] will inhabit it
[2:00] but you and i will have to we don't we
[2:02] don't need a house
[2:04] all right so hebrews 9
[2:06] 11.
[2:07] just remember the sick ones good to have
[2:09] brother gary back and sister julie and
[2:11] all the different ones
[2:12] gathering them back together getting

[2:17] and um
[2:18] we still hearing reports of people
[2:20] passing on uh around the message and
[2:23] brother russell and i were talking about
[2:24] yesterday
[2:26] we're not immune from it
[2:28] but we still got a god that answers
[2:30] prayers
[2:32] we've still got a god that'll answer
[2:33] prayer amen
[2:36] and the prophet of god and the bible
[2:37] tells us these light afflictions
[2:41] these light afflictions that we have to
[2:43] go through are for our perfection if
[2:45] you're the bride of jesus christ amen
[2:48] so let's go to hebrews 9 let's pray
[2:49] before we get started
[2:51] the heavenly father thank you for this
[2:52] day that you give us
[2:54] we pray now that you sanctify us for
[2:56] this journey that we're on lord i pray
[2:58] that you touch us in spirit lord give us
[3:00] revelation you be the one that does the
[3:02] speaking father also touch the ones lord
[3:05] that are sick and body that you'll raise
[3:07] them up for your honor and glory father
[3:09] we know you are the healer you even heal
[3:11] people that don't even ask to be healed
[3:13] all over the world there's people being
[3:15] healed right now that doesn't even know
[3:17] you as their savior father
[3:19] what a good god that we have lord so
[3:21] what much more if a child of god gets on
[3:23] their knees and cries out to the father
[3:26] and says daddy i need help
[3:28] and we need help as the bride lord to
[3:29] get ourselves ready to get out of here
[3:31] lord we pray that you'd be with each one
[3:33] that's not here lord be with the ones
[3:35] that are traveling the ones that are on
[3:38] vacation in different places we pray
[3:40] that you'd give them traveling mercies
[3:41] and be with each one father as we
[3:43] participate in this service
[3:45] may you come down lord and be the active
[3:47] participant in jesus name we ask these
[3:49] things
[3:50] amen all right so let's finish this
[3:53] should be finishing today and then we'll
[3:55] start on something else lord willing a
[3:57] little bit later on
[3:59] but i've enjoyed this eternal redemption
[4:01] it's just it's brought out a lot of a
[4:03] lot of things to me that we we think
[4:05] sometimes we and we do we know the
[4:08] we know the the
[4:10] overlying plan of redemption we know
[4:12] that we were lost and now we're redeemed
[4:15] but then you've got all these little
[4:16] things these little blessings is what i
[4:18] call them they're blessings that we get
[4:20] along the way and the real blessing is
[4:22] is over there at the end in the future
[4:24] home that's our real blessing
[4:26] and then that we can uh have a body
[4:29] change
[4:30] on the earth and then go to that place
[4:33] it's just supernatural that's never
[4:35] happened before like that where a
[4:37] center-borne person takes a body change
[4:40] all right
[4:41] like we're going to so let's read
[4:43] hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming
[4:45] high priest of good things to come by a
[4:46] greater and more perfect tabernacle not
[4:49] made with hands that is to say not of
[4:50] this building neither by the blood of
[4:52] goats and calves but by his own blood he
[4:54] entered in once into the holy place
[4:57] having obtained eternal redemption
[5:00] for us let's go to isaiah 65 for behold
[5:03] i create new heavens
[5:05] and a new earth and the former shall not
[5:07] be remembered nor come into mind
[5:09] let's read one more matthew 25 31
[5:13] and we may pick this up some on the son
[5:15] of man later on but watch this when the
[5:17] son of man shall come in his glory
[5:20] and all the holy angels with him now
[5:24] what is the son of man in his glory
[5:27] that's me and you
[5:29] that's me and you the glory of the son
[5:32] of man is me and you all right because
[5:34] we become the son of man and then we
[5:36] continue on as god in human flesh called
[5:38] a bride
[5:39] and all the holy angels with him then
[5:41] shall he sit upon the throne of his
[5:42] glory now this is this is um
[5:46] this is at the white throne judgment
[5:48] nobody got that
[5:50] because watch it says and before him
[5:51] shall be gathered all nations and he
[5:53] shall separate them one from another as
[5:56] a shepherd divide us his sheep from the
[5:59] goats now it doesn't mean they are sheep
[6:01] but he's dividing them as sheep
[6:03] and goats as the great shepherd would
[6:05] stand and the goats go over here and the
[6:07] sheep go over here all right you may be
[6:08] seeding the lord at his blessing to the
[6:10] reading of the word but it all begins
[6:12] with this
[6:14] in matthew 16 verse 15 he said and he
[6:16] saith unto them but whom say ye that i
[6:18] am and simon peter answered and said
[6:19] thou art the christ
[6:21] the son of the living god
[6:23] and jesus answered and said in him
[6:25] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[6:27] and blood hath not revealed that unto
[6:29] you but my father which is in heaven and
[6:31] i say unto thee they are peter and upon
[6:34] this rock
[6:36] revelation i will build my church
[6:39] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[6:42] against it knowing that the gates of
[6:44] hell has always been against the true
[6:46] church of god and as we were talking
[6:48] wednesday night you got to remember that
[6:51] that thank god that a prophet came and
[6:53] told us that we can read in the bible
[6:55] and we see a group of people
[6:57] and the world wants to call them church
[7:00] god calls them bride because there's now
[7:03] a separation between church and bride
[7:06] the wife has made herself ready not the
[7:08] church the church is the church nominal
[7:10] that's the church out there that's the
[7:12] that's the foolish virgin that's the cup
[7:14] of water in my name that's even the ones
[7:16] that's not going to make it
[7:19] amen that's the church
[7:22] now we know that brother branham talks
[7:24] about us being the church of the living
[7:26] god
[7:28] but now as we come to the end time
[7:30] though i want to hone that down to where
[7:31] we're the bride
[7:33] we're his wife
[7:35] we have been married to him and we are
[7:37] getting we are going to make ourselves
[7:40] ready to go to another dimensions
[7:42] everybody got to have to say amen
[7:45] i will build my church so now when we
[7:47] interpret that
[7:49] that's not going i will build
[7:51] a church
[7:54] because there's many churches out there
[7:56] you know god said i will build my church
[7:58] so my church is the bride
[8:02] it's not anything else my church is the
[8:05] bride
[8:06] all right so now and then all then what
[8:08] happened to that bride that went through
[8:10] seven church ages they had seven
[8:12] messengers they had seven messages
[8:16] they had a
[8:17] group of people that come under their
[8:19] messenger that they
[8:20] lived it the best they could and they
[8:22] got the baptism of the holy ghost they
[8:24] died some of them under-martyred them
[8:26] some of them died
[8:28] from just natural causes but now we've
[8:30] come up to this last church age and if
[8:32] you're born again today you've been
[8:34] called out of that church age you're not
[8:36] in that church
[8:39] nominal
[8:40] and then after we see that and
[8:42] and then we're after we come to a
[8:44] position and we've already talked about
[8:46] this that's why i'm trying to get
[8:47] through it a little bit
[8:49] but you got to put in there and i like
[8:50] brother russ we're talking about
[8:51] something yesterday
[8:54] i hadn't really seen it this way which
[8:55] so i'll bring it out i'll just use it
[8:57] buddy just
[8:58] if it's copyrighted just chart send me a
[9:00] bell
[9:02] but we were talking about you know the
[9:04] bible doesn't tell us to have the faith
[9:07] of enoch
[9:08] now you know it was translated
[9:11] that he could didn't see death enoch was
[9:13] the top of the bride right
[9:14] but now why does the bible tell us we
[9:16] must have the faith of abraham
[9:20] it didn't say have the faith of enoch
[9:22] it says we must have the faith of
[9:24] abraham we are we are part of that
[9:27] abraham covenant
[9:30] why
[9:38] abraham took a body change
[9:41] on this earth
[9:43] and produced the promised child
[9:46] that's why we should have the faith of
[9:47] abraham the bible doesn't say like i
[9:49] said it doesn't have the faith of enoch
[9:51] we must have the faith of abraham the
[9:53] faith of abraham was that he
[9:55] believed god and it was imputed unto him
[9:58] for righteousness and he took a body
[10:00] change from that old vile 99 year old
[10:02] body that he had
[10:05] changed back to a young man well that's
[10:07] the faith that you and i gotta have
[10:09] is for a resurrection a body change and
[10:12] a rapture and it's gotta be in that
[10:13] order a resurrection
[10:16] voice of the resurrection the trump of
[10:18] god will sound
[10:19] the dead in christ shall rise first and
[10:21] then we which are alive and remain will
[10:23] be changed and then we'll be caught up
[10:25] as here in revelations 4 1 says after
[10:28] this i looked and behold the door was
[10:29] opened in heaven
[10:30] the first voice which i heard was as it
[10:32] were a trumpet talking with me which
[10:34] said
[10:34] come up hither i will show thee things
[10:36] which must be
[10:37] hereafter now he's fixing to show john
[10:41] after the church ages he's fishing
[10:43] show john prophetic
[10:46] prophetic
[10:47] um happenings from now
[10:50] until the future home comes there in
[10:52] revelations 20 something 22 and
[10:55] immediately i was in the spirit and
[10:56] behold the throne was set in heaven
[10:58] and one set on the throne so we took a
[11:00] rapture we went up
[11:02] come up hither and then we know that
[11:05] after we leave this place matthew 24 21
[11:09] for then shall be great tribulations
[11:11] such as not since the beginning of the
[11:13] world to this time nor ever shall be
[11:16] the great tribulation
[11:17] listen you and i go through tribulation
[11:21] tribulation worketh patience
[11:23] right
[11:24] but we will not go through the great
[11:26] tribulation
[11:27] the great tribulation is the wrath of
[11:29] god poured out upon a sinful earth
[11:33] there's nobody here that's got the holy
[11:35] ghost once 144 000 leave there's nobody
[11:38] on earth with the holy ghost so god just
[11:40] there's no reason for him to hold back
[11:43] his wrath because everybody all the
[11:45] players that were that were put into
[11:48] this eternal plan of redemption has been
[11:50] plugged in and taken out
[11:53] all right
[11:55] because remember the sinners are not
[11:57] considered in redemption
[12:00] you know what the prophet of god said
[12:02] we're the only ones considered in
[12:04] redemption and then connected to us is
[12:06] the foolish virgin and connected to the
[12:08] 144
[12:09] and then the cup of water in my name
[12:12] and then after that there's no
[12:14] connection
[12:15] amen they have decided to go the way of
[12:18] the goat and there's nothing we can do
[12:19] about it but see that's all that's going
[12:21] to be here
[12:22] when this great tribulation
[12:25] happens and he says even except these
[12:26] days should be shortened there will be
[12:28] no flesh saved for the but for the elect
[12:30] sate those days shall be shortened and
[12:33] thank god we always complain about
[12:36] uh
[12:38] you know the year's getting shorter but
[12:39] you know what i don't want the years get
[12:41] longer
[12:42] i want the ears to get shorter
[12:44] it gives us one more day to get out of
[12:46] here
[12:47] all right so now let's go to revelations
[12:49] 2 verse 20.
[12:50] notwithstanding i have a few things
[12:52] against thee because thou suffered that
[12:53] woman jezebel now what's he talking
[12:55] about he's talking about the religious
[12:56] world
[12:57] he's talking about the church
[13:00] which calls herself a prophetess to
[13:03] teach and seduce my servants to commit
[13:05] fornication my servants
[13:07] see how close it is and eat things
[13:09] sacrificed into idols and i give her
[13:10] space to repent two thousand years
[13:13] of her fornication and she repented not
[13:15] behold i will cast her into a bed and
[13:17] then that commit adultery with her into
[13:19] great tribulation
[13:21] if you'll read in the bible
[13:24] where we're looking at the great
[13:25] tribulation and we see that even when
[13:29] russia puts the bomb down the middle of
[13:31] the vatican and and all that that if you
[13:34] read your bible the bible says merchants
[13:36] of the earth and the great men and the
[13:38] and the
[13:39] and the politicians or whatever you want
[13:41] to call them they're standing in all and
[13:44] they're standing away from the city
[13:46] because they don't have anything to do
[13:47] with it now but they're they're
[13:49] wondering what is this great thing
[13:51] well they've all been deceived by it
[13:54] and at that time it's been years they've
[13:56] been deceived by it
[14:00] but
[14:01] they lean to their economy
[14:04] and their money rather than leaning to
[14:06] god amen behold i will cast her into a
[14:09] bed and them that committed adultery
[14:10] with her into great tribulation except
[14:13] they repented their deeds
[14:15] and most will not so revelations 13 4
[14:19] and they worshipped the dragon which
[14:21] gave power unto the beast and they
[14:22] worshiped the beast saying who is
[14:24] likened to the beast now who is this
[14:25] this is the people of the earth
[14:28] they're in love with this guy
[14:30] and they they just think they think so
[14:32] much of him they think he's christ he's
[14:34] you know he's the he's the man of the
[14:36] hour he's the christ of the hour
[14:38] and there was given unto him a mouth
[14:39] speaking great things in blasphemies and
[14:41] power was given unto him to continue 42
[14:44] months that's 260 days
[14:46] and he opened his mouth and blasphemy
[14:48] against god to blaspheme his name and
[14:50] his tabernacle and them that dwell in
[14:51] heaven and it would give them him to
[14:53] make war with the saints to overcome
[14:55] them and power was given unto him over
[14:57] kindred tongues and nations
[14:59] now here in all that dwell upon the
[15:00] earth all
[15:03] every person that dwells on the earth
[15:06] excuse me shall worship him whose names
[15:07] are not written in the book of the life
[15:09] of the lamb slain from the foundation
[15:12] of the world that's the bride
[15:15] that's the eternal section of that
[15:17] lamb's book of life not the section that
[15:19] judas was in and was taken out of
[15:22] or then the same way with people that
[15:24] judas wasn't the only one that got his
[15:26] name put on the boat and took out
[15:28] no there's millions and probably
[15:30] billions
[15:31] that hazard was put on the book as a
[15:33] religious order
[15:35] and they're going to be taken off just
[15:37] like judas was because they didn't go
[15:39] get the holy ghost only the people with
[15:41] the baptism of the holy ghost has those
[15:43] names written in that lamb's book of
[15:45] life the eternal section
[15:48] amen the eternal section not just the
[15:50] section of the book the eternal section
[15:52] that's the genesis 1 26 man that's the
[15:55] one that that the everybody talks about
[15:57] the seed and the seed the dock to the
[15:59] seed doctrine the seed seed that genesis
[16:01] 1 26 that's your seed
[16:04] but it was withholding
[16:06] that you come here with it because you
[16:08] can't have to come here a sinner
[16:11] to be redeemed
[16:13] to be redeemable
[16:16] listen there's some people it's not
[16:17] redeemable
[16:20] adolf hitler but he decided that god
[16:24] didn't
[16:25] he decided to not be redeemable
[16:27] that's your free moral agency
[16:30] amen
[16:31] so now let's go to revelations 11 3
[16:34] and i will give him power give power to
[16:36] my two witnesses now here we've already
[16:38] took a rapture
[16:40] we've gone into rapture we're going to
[16:42] the wedding supper we're in another
[16:43] dimension doesn't matter what we're
[16:44] going to be doing
[16:46] but what's going to happen on the earth
[16:47] is continue because listen once we go to
[16:50] come to a body change and once all the
[16:51] dead saints come out of the ground and
[16:53] they take a body change they've
[16:54] completed their redemption
[16:57] okay
[16:59] we've completed the bride will complete
[17:01] their redemption when we take a rapture
[17:03] off of this earth we've completed our
[17:05] redemption we're just going to be here
[17:07] on a honeymoon or we're going to be in a
[17:10] wedding supper in a honeymoon
[17:12] and then we're going to stand in
[17:13] judgment not in judgment but not to be
[17:16] judged but to stand in judgment to judge
[17:18] and then we're going to a future home
[17:20] that's our house
[17:22] and there's no other position
[17:24] i mean i don't know where there's some
[17:26] place that we're going to get crowns and
[17:28] all the the things that the bible tells
[17:30] us about but i really don't know where
[17:32] that position is at and it really
[17:34] doesn't matter just make sure you get
[17:35] there
[17:37] i don't mind if he gives me one crown
[17:39] just look at me and say
[17:41] you've done a good job
[17:43] you kept the faith you fought the fight
[17:46] and now here is a crown of life what
[17:49] eternal life but listen see we receive
[17:51] that eternal life crown here
[17:53] we receive our white robes here
[17:57] you see what god's done for his children
[17:59] he's he's made it we think
[18:02] we think this is so hard but he's made
[18:04] it easy
[18:06] life is hard
[18:08] life is hard
[18:11] but being a christian shouldn't be thou
[18:14] hard
[18:15] in the soul part of you
[18:17] whether you're hurting and whether
[18:19] you're whether you're laying in a bed of
[18:20] affliction or not that's not your soul
[18:24] your soul if it's born again is already
[18:26] in the future home
[18:28] it's a part of the future home it can't
[18:30] there's there's no way it can be pulled
[18:33] out
[18:34] there's no way it can be judged as far
[18:36] as eternal versus not eternal
[18:39] it's done
[18:41] it's finished
[18:42] as we were talking about wednesday night
[18:44] but you got to remember that old
[18:46] husband's got to be d-e-a-d
[18:49] not d-i-v-o-r-c-e
[18:52] dead
[18:56] if it is dead
[18:58] it'll never resurrect again did i
[19:00] misspell that
[19:01] i didn't okay and was looking at me
[19:03] laughing divr's oh don't be singing the
[19:05] song
[19:08] come on people good grief
[19:12] so now we'll talk about tammy wynette
[19:14] and um george jones for the rest of the
[19:16] service because that's the rest of y'all
[19:18] going to be singing it in your head
[19:20] or whoever that was the thing that's on
[19:21] oh geez so anyway
[19:24] so it's not
[19:27] that's the problem that is the problem
[19:29] is the divorce part
[19:32] because listen if that old husband's
[19:34] dead he can't be resurrected
[19:38] you you can't have you can't have the
[19:40] old um
[19:43] what is it luke what luke something that
[19:45] the unclean spirit goes out well see
[19:47] that unclean spirit goes out but now if
[19:49] it comes back it's still alive but you
[19:51] gotta have you got to kill that thing
[19:54] or it will reside back that's why it
[19:57] divorced
[19:59] but it's still alive
[20:01] and it came back and found the house
[20:03] sweat and garnished okay and then he
[20:06] re-entered that house
[20:08] well now the bible says the good man of
[20:10] the house kills that thing
[20:13] in another scripture the good man of the
[20:14] house so you take if he's the strong man
[20:17] or the strong man of the house if he
[20:19] kills that spirit
[20:21] it won't come back anymore
[20:23] now listen the devil's too smart for
[20:25] that
[20:26] he'll try to get you in another angle or
[20:29] another way
[20:30] or as we were talking a couple days ago
[20:33] you know like dad said he never drank
[20:34] beer in his life but boy once you get
[20:36] saved and born again somebody pops open
[20:38] a beer and you're going
[20:42] that looks so good why the devil the
[20:45] devil has lost his hold on you going and
[20:48] participating in that again
[20:51] but he knows there's a spirit realm of
[20:53] you that still remembers what you did
[20:56] and he absolutely reminds you listen god
[20:59] doesn't remind you of your past
[21:02] because he doesn't know it's there
[21:04] because it's d-e-a-d
[21:07] when it's put in the sea of god's
[21:09] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[21:11] again there's that death that we're
[21:13] talking about that we put it in that
[21:15] watery grave and we leave it there
[21:19] we don't pull it back out
[21:21] that's our problem sometimes we drag
[21:23] things back out under the blood don't do
[21:24] that
[21:28] because see you'll have a problem
[21:32] and the devil knows it just as soon as
[21:34] you do it because he'll start pounding
[21:36] on you and pounding on you but he's
[21:37] that's his job
[21:40] but now we've already taken a rapture
[21:42] so we're gone up in the wedding supper
[21:44] and we're in another dimension but god
[21:47] is not finished with the eternal plan of
[21:49] redemption because the connection that
[21:51] we have with 144 000 is they're going to
[21:54] get the same message we got right
[21:57] they're only going to get it though
[21:58] through two witnesses where we got it
[22:01] through a gentile prophet they're going
[22:02] to get it through moses and elijah being
[22:04] jews over there that they will be able
[22:08] to what they'll be able to understand
[22:09] them
[22:10] all right and i will give power to my
[22:12] two witnesses and they shall prophesy
[22:13] one thousand two hundred and three score
[22:15] days clothed in sackcloth these are the
[22:17] two olive trees the two candlesticks
[22:19] standing before the god
[22:21] of the earth and then they're going to
[22:24] preach to them go to daniel 9 24.
[22:28] and we go back to the 70 weeks of daniel
[22:29] boy i've really
[22:31] i've really been wanting to get back
[22:32] into 70 weeks of daniel so we may do
[22:34] that later on if the lord tarries
[22:36] but 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[22:38] people and upon thy holy city
[22:41] to do six things
[22:43] what's the first three finish the
[22:45] transgression who did the transgressing
[22:48] israel are you
[22:50] all right
[22:52] who did the sinning
[22:53] you did israel did
[22:56] and who's going to reconcile us for the
[22:59] iniquity that we that we had
[23:02] it's going to be god so listen we get
[23:04] saved the same way they did as as as
[23:07] we've been talking before you're never
[23:09] going to get away from justification
[23:11] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[23:13] ghost
[23:14] that's the three stages or or steps
[23:17] of grace and even
[23:20] the 144 000 that they're going to be
[23:23] preached to by two witnesses and they're
[23:25] going to realize that what they did
[23:28] they killed the messiah well they
[23:30] literally killed him
[23:32] their lineage
[23:34] we didn't literally kill him but we did
[23:36] put him on the cross amen i mean we
[23:39] weren't there
[23:41] but when they said let his blood be on
[23:43] us and our children it carried through
[23:45] the 2000 years that god was dealing with
[23:47] the gentiles
[23:49] they had that curse on them they had a
[23:50] transgression they had a sin they had an
[23:53] iniquity
[23:55] that god was going to purge as we'll
[23:57] maybe read it a little bit later well
[23:58] here in jeremiah you talk about jacob's
[24:01] trouble
[24:03] not ours jacob's trouble all right so
[24:05] let's read that in jeremiah 30.
[24:08] now we know the other three we had the
[24:10] we didn't read the last three bringing
[24:12] everlasting righteousness self-division
[24:14] prophecy in north the most holy we know
[24:15] that's going on into the millennium alas
[24:18] for that day is that day is great so
[24:21] that none is like it is even the time of
[24:23] jacob's trouble but he shall be saved
[24:25] out of it look at all the promises that
[24:27] god he condemns
[24:29] i've been reading in amos and all the
[24:31] little all the little prophets man they
[24:33] just cut israel to the core they call
[24:36] them and prostitutes and and i
[24:38] think it was amos or one of them god
[24:40] told them to go marry a prostitute to
[24:42] show israel that they married the
[24:44] prophet that they were prostitutes and
[24:46] have children by them and god condemns
[24:48] them condemns them condemns them then
[24:50] all of a sudden he says but i'm going to
[24:51] save you
[24:54] i can't forget you i'm going to save you
[24:57] even in the 70 weeks of daniel well if
[24:59] it wasn't for the 70 weeks of daniel
[25:00] israel couldn't be saved
[25:03] but even the time of jacob's trouble but
[25:05] he shall be saved out of it for it shall
[25:07] come to pass in that day saith the lord
[25:09] of hosts that i will break his yoke from
[25:11] off thy neck and will burst thy bonds
[25:13] and strangers shall no more serve
[25:16] themselves of him
[25:18] strangers
[25:20] russians
[25:22] germans
[25:24] americans
[25:26] wherever they've been dispersed the jew
[25:28] has been persecuted
[25:31] everywhere i mean they kicked them out
[25:33] right and left
[25:35] it was just that they got them down in
[25:37] one place where hitler could deal with
[25:38] them during the during the holocaust
[25:41] but that was god though
[25:43] bringing his
[25:44] children back his children that he
[25:46] worked with the first time but they
[25:48] shall serve the lord their god and david
[25:50] their king who i will raise up unto them
[25:52] now we're heading toward the millennium
[25:54] therefore fear their fear they are not o
[25:56] servant jacob saith the lord need to be
[25:58] dismayed o israel for lo i will save
[26:00] thee
[26:01] from afar
[26:02] and thy seed from the land of their
[26:04] captivity
[26:06] russia
[26:07] germany united states
[26:09] italy wherever they're dispersed i'm
[26:11] going to save you from that but now
[26:13] remember daniel 70 weeks is talking
[26:15] about the people
[26:17] and what the city
[26:21] they got to get back to the city they
[26:23] got to get back into their homeland
[26:25] and thy seed from the land of their
[26:27] captivity and jacob shall return
[26:31] and shall be in rest and be quiet and
[26:33] none shall make him afraid for i am with
[26:36] thee saith the lord to save thee though
[26:38] i make a full end of all nations whether
[26:41] i have scattered thee
[26:43] yet will i not make a full end of thee
[26:46] but i will correct thee and measure and
[26:48] will not leave thee all together
[26:49] unpunished now remember they weren't
[26:51] unpunished
[26:53] my lord look at israel they've been
[26:55] persecuted since the time that they said
[26:57] let his blood be on us and our children
[26:59] they've been killed and slaughtered and
[27:01] six and a half million of them just
[27:03] because they were jews
[27:05] were killed
[27:06] not because they did anything
[27:09] they were just jews
[27:11] and they were killed because satan hated
[27:13] them so bad through hitler and all
[27:16] stalin and all those so let's go to
[27:17] revelation 6 verse 12.
[27:22] and we get to the sixth seal like we
[27:23] were talking about wednesday night
[27:25] i beheld when he had opened the sixth
[27:27] seal
[27:28] although there was a great earthquake
[27:29] and the sun became black as sackcloth of
[27:31] hair and the moon became his blood and
[27:33] the stars of heaven fell into the earth
[27:34] even as a fig tree
[27:36] casteth her untimely figs when she is
[27:38] shaken of a mighty wind
[27:40] and the heavens departed as a scroll
[27:41] when it rolled together and every
[27:43] mountain and ireland were moved out of
[27:44] their places wow and see here the kings
[27:47] of the earth and the great men the rich
[27:49] men
[27:50] chief captains the mighty men and every
[27:53] bondman and every freeman
[27:55] brother russ and i were talking about
[27:57] you know we we're looking for a total
[27:59] collapse of the economy and it will
[28:02] happen there'll be a crash
[28:04] for us at least the united states
[28:07] but somehow it gets all put back
[28:09] together under something
[28:13] called the catholic church or the rome
[28:15] some way they get look it says the rich
[28:18] men
[28:20] it's not that everybody's destitute now
[28:22] we don't care because we're gone
[28:24] but the world's gonna have to build an
[28:26] economy back up to have all these things
[28:30] the kings great men rich men chief
[28:33] captains mighty men every bondman and
[28:36] every free man that's us the ones that
[28:38] don't have the money
[28:39] hidden themselves in the dens and in the
[28:41] rocks of the mountains instead of the
[28:42] mountains and rocks fall on us and hide
[28:44] us from the face of him that sitteth on
[28:46] the throne and from the wrath of the
[28:47] lamb now we're heading toward the battle
[28:49] of armageddon here for the great day of
[28:51] his wrath has come and who shall be able
[28:55] to stand
[28:56] so now let's read revelation 7
[28:59] 1
[29:00] and after these things i saw four angels
[29:02] standing on the four corners of the
[29:03] earth
[29:04] holding the four winds water winds wars
[29:08] that the wind should not blow on the
[29:09] earth nor on the scene or on any tree
[29:11] and i saw another angel ascending from
[29:13] the east having the seal of the living
[29:15] god
[29:16] and cry with a loud voice of the four
[29:18] angels to whom was given to hurt the
[29:19] earth
[29:20] and sea saying hurt not the earth
[29:23] neither the sea nor the trees till we
[29:25] have sealed the servants
[29:28] now listen you and i are not servants
[29:31] okay we're bride
[29:33] so that's not us
[29:37] but it is a group of people
[29:39] that's going to be saved
[29:41] till we have sealed what is the seal the
[29:43] baptism of the holy ghost until we have
[29:45] sealed the servants of our god in their
[29:47] foreheads all right appear they're
[29:49] intelligent and i heard the number of
[29:51] them which were sealed and there were
[29:52] sealed 140 and 4 000 of all the tribes
[29:56] of the children of israel in other words
[29:57] 12 000
[29:59] from 12 tribes
[30:00] okay 144 000. everybody got that i'm
[30:03] sure
[30:04] that that's pretty simple but just make
[30:06] sure that we realize this is not the
[30:08] bride
[30:09] this is servants we're already gone
[30:12] that's why you have to realize that when
[30:14] brother branham said from revelations 4
[30:16] 1 to 1921
[30:19] has nothing to do with gentiles
[30:22] because we're not on the earth at that
[30:23] time
[30:24] remember revelations 4 1 we go up
[30:27] we're not here we don't come back till
[30:30] we read it in a minute to revelation 19
[30:32] 21 come back right into the millennium
[30:35] but now in between that we must get the
[30:37] spiritual part of that because it's part
[30:39] of the eternal plan of redemption
[30:41] amen so it is part of your redemption
[30:43] the seals the vials the plagues
[30:46] you and i will not see this with our
[30:48] physical eyes i hope not
[30:50] but we get the spiritual aspect of all
[30:52] these
[30:54] seals vials plagues that's what we
[30:57] talked about wednesday night
[30:59] on that sixth seal
[31:01] let's read daniel 9 27.
[31:04] we'll talk about that just for just for
[31:06] a minute and he shall confirm the
[31:08] covenant
[31:09] who's that he the antichrist
[31:12] that's the one that's going to what he's
[31:13] going to confirm the covenant with
[31:15] israel not the world
[31:17] he's going to have a covenant with
[31:18] israel for one week because we're still
[31:20] on daniel 9. who is it daniel's people
[31:22] and the city
[31:23] all right so it's not talking to the
[31:24] gentiles it's talking to daniel's people
[31:27] and in the midst of the week in other
[31:28] words after three and a half years
[31:30] that's the midst of the seven years that
[31:32] are left
[31:33] after the rapture of the church
[31:34] according to the bible and according to
[31:36] the prophet's message
[31:37] he shall cause the sacrifice and the
[31:39] oblation
[31:41] to cease
[31:43] whatever he made that
[31:45] covenant with
[31:47] whatever it is he's going to break it
[31:49] and say we're not going to do that
[31:50] anymore
[31:51] all right and for the overspreading of
[31:53] abominations he shall make it desolate
[31:56] even until the consummation now what is
[31:58] the consummation that's the millennium
[32:01] because the consummation to the jews is
[32:04] entering into that jubilee of the
[32:08] millennium see this is not to us
[32:11] remember this is not to the bride we're
[32:13] gone
[32:16] but there are going to be a literal
[32:18] overspreading of abomination he shall
[32:20] make it desolate even until the
[32:21] consummation and that determine shall be
[32:24] poured out upon the desolate in other
[32:27] words there's going to be a war
[32:29] there's going to be two prophets that's
[32:31] going to cause this world to just turn
[32:33] upside down
[32:35] because of the sixth seal i read it
[32:36] there where he opened the sixth seal and
[32:38] the prophet of god thank god for a
[32:40] prophet that told us who opens that
[32:41] sixth seal
[32:43] that six seals opened by those two
[32:45] prophets it is man
[32:47] or not man but god
[32:49] through man
[32:53] holding all nature just like adam did
[32:57] before the fall
[32:59] but i believe it's going to happen to me
[33:00] and you before that time comes
[33:03] because there's got to be a type we've
[33:05] got to see the type that they're going
[33:07] to do it literally on the earth but
[33:09] god's going to have to as we were
[33:10] talking wednesday night that we're going
[33:12] to have to have a sixth seal
[33:14] sanctification
[33:16] like never before that that statue of a
[33:18] perfect man is going to have to burn out
[33:21] all the mountains burn out all the
[33:23] valleys he's going to have to take off
[33:24] whatever this is right here says i'll be
[33:26] held when he opened the sixth seal and
[33:28] there was a great earthquake
[33:30] i'm telling you folks if you hadn't been
[33:32] shook these past two years
[33:35] if you hadn't been shook and you're
[33:37] right to down to your own physical being
[33:40] in these last two years you got a
[33:41] problem
[33:44] but you know what god's doing
[33:47] i was thinking yesterday
[33:50] he said there was ease in zion
[33:54] hadn't needed nothing
[33:56] in revelations 3.
[34:00] i mean look at us
[34:02] we're driving cars that cost more than
[34:04] our first house cost
[34:07] we got jobs that make good money
[34:10] if this is tribulation it's not so bad
[34:14] but god's going to make it to where we
[34:16] don't like this place anymore
[34:19] we've come to a point to where god said
[34:21] i've had enough
[34:23] this is too easy
[34:25] you're not praying enough
[34:28] you're not seeking god enough
[34:32] because what's going to happen to those
[34:33] two witnesses they're going to call down
[34:36] anything they brother brown said
[34:37] whatever comes out of their mouth that's
[34:39] what's going to happen
[34:40] now i believe that you and i are going
[34:42] to see that in its in part here as the
[34:44] gentile church age ends or gentile age
[34:47] ends you're going to see it with the two
[34:49] witnesses but you're going to see it
[34:50] before that in me and you because listen
[34:53] to come to adoption it's got to come to
[34:56] what full authority
[34:59] so what's the two witnesses going to
[35:00] have full authority over nature so now
[35:04] god is going to have full authority over
[35:06] your nature
[35:08] that's our problem there's too much of
[35:09] us still alive
[35:11] amen
[35:12] so that six seal sanctification has got
[35:14] to come to me and you and remember what
[35:17] is it it's what proceeds out of those
[35:19] two witnesses mouth it's a sharp sword
[35:22] it's a it's a flame of fire it's the
[35:25] word
[35:26] amen so you and i have to come to word
[35:29] maturity first
[35:31] and coming to word maturity because if
[35:33] you don't then as we were talking
[35:34] yesterday power without character is
[35:36] satanic
[35:38] so if you got the power
[35:40] but you don't have the character
[35:43] you might destroy somebody you just
[35:44] really don't like
[35:46] and that's not for you to do
[35:49] amen
[35:51] same thing with this sixth seal
[35:54] because what happens after the sixth
[35:56] seal opens
[36:00] the two witnesses are killed right
[36:02] but there's a rapture takes place after
[36:05] the sixth seal opens
[36:08] the seventh seal
[36:10] produces itself which is christ brings
[36:12] christ to the earth to fight for israel
[36:15] but it brings christ to the earth for me
[36:17] and you
[36:18] to take a rapture with
[36:21] amen amen so we are we're looking at
[36:23] that six seal sanctification before the
[36:26] dead can come out of the ground
[36:30] that's what we're looking at we're look
[36:32] we're under that six seal sanctification
[36:35] to where we're looking at something that
[36:37] will happen that's never happened before
[36:41] that you're going to call all the dead
[36:42] saints out of the ground
[36:45] but it's going to have to come by the
[36:47] word
[36:48] proceeding out of somebody's mouth
[36:51] that comes to
[36:52] maturity see because the two witnesses
[36:55] and the 144 thousand
[36:57] they don't have to come to that maturity
[37:02] they're promised the holy ghost
[37:04] they're promised that then they're going
[37:06] to have to die
[37:07] and then they're going to take a rapture
[37:09] they're going to you know resurrect and
[37:10] then take a rapture in just a few days
[37:13] but we're looking at there's no telling
[37:15] how many thousands of bride that's
[37:18] laying in the earth
[37:20] that's going to come up in that day
[37:22] and they're going to be here as
[37:24] as
[37:26] brother russ was talking about yesterday
[37:28] you know
[37:29] that's going to happen
[37:32] and we're not even going to have a
[37:33] glorified body
[37:37] think about it
[37:39] the dead in christ shall rise first
[37:42] and we which are alive and remain shall
[37:44] be
[37:45] changed
[37:47] but remember
[37:49] there was somebody did it before we did
[37:52] the lord jesus walked up to the tomb of
[37:54] lazarus in a
[37:57] human
[37:58] corrupt
[38:00] body
[38:02] and he said lazarus come forth
[38:06] he wasn't in a glorified body when he
[38:08] caught lazarus and stuff out of the
[38:09] ground
[38:11] he was just a human being man now i say
[38:13] just but the almighty god was inside of
[38:15] him well listen that same almighty god
[38:18] if it's inside of you you've got the new
[38:19] birth it's the same identical thing
[38:21] that's what i'm trying to tell everybody
[38:23] we're thinking we're something separate
[38:24] from that
[38:26] but brother brown said the resurrection
[38:27] lies inside of you well where where was
[38:30] it in jesus
[38:31] it was inside of him
[38:34] he didn't have to go find it
[38:36] or go get it
[38:39] or shout it up
[38:41] or pump it up
[38:44] that's the only time he ever raised his
[38:45] voice i believe he said lazarus
[38:48] come forth because about the bible said
[38:49] he cried with a loud voice that and when
[38:51] he died
[38:53] ain't no need to be screaming at the
[38:54] devil
[38:56] screaming at the devil ain't going to
[38:58] bother him one bit
[39:00] but i'll guarantee you if you go
[39:02] get those virtues sealed in you
[39:04] and the headstone comes
[39:07] that's what he can't find
[39:09] he can't fight that because he's not he
[39:11] can't come to it
[39:13] so he's not going to fight it he can't
[39:14] fight him
[39:16] all right so let's look at revelations
[39:17] 11
[39:20] verse 7-12 and when they shall have
[39:22] finished their testimony the beasts that
[39:24] ascended out of the bottomless pit shall
[39:26] make war against them and shall overcome
[39:29] them
[39:30] and kill them
[39:32] so they're going to kill them
[39:34] and their dead bodies shall line the
[39:35] streets of the great city which
[39:37] spiritually is called sodom and egypt
[39:38] where also our lord was crucified so
[39:40] that would be jerusalem
[39:42] and they of the people and kindred and
[39:44] tongues and nations shall see their dead
[39:45] bodies three days and a half and shall
[39:47] not suffer their dead bodies to be put
[39:49] in graves
[39:50] and they that dwell upon the earth shall
[39:52] rejoice over them and make merry and
[39:53] send gifts one to another i was reading
[39:55] a quote where brother brown said the
[39:57] only
[39:59] there was one
[40:00] country that started that
[40:02] and that was rome
[40:04] when they'd have a battle and they'd
[40:06] come back from the battle they'd be
[40:08] given gifts and i think some of them
[40:09] even talked about the uh the little
[40:11] thing you see the little reeds on around
[40:14] the
[40:15] headbands of some of those romans they
[40:17] were given those as gifts because they
[40:19] came back and won a battle or they won
[40:21] something they were always giving gifts
[40:23] so that's brother brown said that's
[40:24] what's going to happen
[40:26] is
[40:27] the gift giving is going to be from rome
[40:29] because you know what they're going to
[40:30] persecute if rome controls the world
[40:33] that's who they're persecuting
[40:35] the two witnesses because these two
[40:37] prophets tormented them that dwell on
[40:39] the earth and after three days and a
[40:41] half the spirit of life from god entered
[40:43] into them and they stood upon their feet
[40:45] and great fear fell upon them which saw
[40:47] them
[40:48] and they heard a great voice from heaven
[40:50] saying unto them come up hither same as
[40:52] revelations 4 1 come up ether so they're
[40:54] going to take a rapture and they
[40:56] ascended up to heaven in a cloud and
[40:58] their enemies
[41:00] beheld them so let's look at the chart
[41:02] for me if you would pull that chart up
[41:04] brother
[41:05] brother anderson not the daniel 70
[41:07] wheats one but the one for the eternal
[41:09] plan of redemption
[41:11] so now where are we at
[41:13] make that a little bigger right over
[41:14] there
[41:15] bringing it this way
[41:18] come on over a little bit more
[41:21] there you go
[41:22] all right so all born-again believers
[41:23] are going into rapture revelations 4 1.
[41:25] two prophets are going to prophesy three
[41:27] and a half years
[41:31] the tribulation period revelations 11
[41:33] the two prophets
[41:34] and then what is going to be a rapture
[41:36] for the jews
[41:39] so that takes everybody off the earth
[41:42] that has anything to do with the holy
[41:44] ghost everybody got that
[41:47] there won't be a holy ghost of in
[41:49] anybody
[41:52] in this group that's left
[41:54] so what's going to happen
[41:56] what's going to happen is
[41:59] you're going to see the battle of
[42:01] armageddon you're going to see the
[42:02] termination of forces and we'll talk
[42:04] about that in just a second
[42:09] but let's go to revelations 19 verse 6
[42:13] because
[42:14] this is going to help me and you i want
[42:16] to i want to bring something in here and
[42:18] i heard it as it were the voice of a
[42:20] great multitude in the voice of many
[42:21] waters the voice of mighty thundering
[42:23] saying hallelujah for the lord god
[42:25] omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and
[42:27] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[42:29] marriage of the lamb has come
[42:32] and his wife
[42:33] hath made herself ready
[42:35] his wife
[42:37] have made herself ready and to her
[42:40] was granted that she be arrayed in fine
[42:43] linen clean and white for the fine linen
[42:45] is the righteousness of saints and he
[42:48] said unto me right blessed are they
[42:50] which are called unto the marriage
[42:52] supper of the lamb
[42:54] and he saith unto me these are the true
[42:56] sayings of god you remember brother
[42:59] branham talking about the armored meat
[43:01] packing girl
[43:02] or the armored meat packing guy and then
[43:05] the the sisters or the girls
[43:08] well it's real strange i was talking to
[43:09] brother claude the other day and he said
[43:11] you know he said brother branham he
[43:13] tells that story
[43:15] all through his ministry
[43:17] till he gets to the sixth seal
[43:20] and on the sixth seal he tells the same
[43:22] story and he never tells it again
[43:26] what is your sixth seal sanctification
[43:28] the bride has made herself ready
[43:31] and the armored meat packing girl i
[43:33] don't know you know most of you know the
[43:34] story
[43:36] but there was armor
[43:37] armor hot dogs everybody knows with
[43:39] armor meat packing they were a meat
[43:41] company in chicago and they went out
[43:43] west
[43:44] and they were going to have a little
[43:45] shin dig out there and they were going
[43:46] to have a party and they were going to
[43:48] dance but the the son of the meat
[43:51] packing company
[43:52] went out there to find him a wife
[43:56] so what happened was is all the other
[43:59] girls got their self and put on their
[44:01] paint and their
[44:03] you understand what i'm saying
[44:06] but there was one girl that was off in
[44:08] the corner that was doing what she was
[44:09] doing work
[44:11] brother brown said she had an old
[44:12] tattered dress
[44:14] said her hair probably wasn't even fixed
[44:16] up it was just tied up in a bun
[44:20] and she washed the dishes
[44:23] she didn't participate in any of those
[44:25] as brother brown said those
[44:26] denominational ideas
[44:28] she kept herself separate
[44:31] and in keeping herself separate
[44:34] one day the armored meat packing boy
[44:37] walked outside
[44:39] to get away from all that that was going
[44:41] on inside
[44:42] as brother brown said all them
[44:44] denominational ideas he was getting away
[44:45] from trying to get away from those
[44:47] denominational ideas what those women
[44:50] that was fixing their self up
[44:52] and you know what they were trying to
[44:54] make their self ready listen there's not
[44:56] a nominal christian in this world that
[44:58] doesn't think jesus christ is coming
[45:01] and there's not a nominal christian in
[45:02] the world that's not trying to get ready
[45:05] but they don't know how
[45:08] they don't know how to get ready
[45:11] but that little girl she was so special
[45:15] and he walked outside just to get some
[45:17] fresh air the prophet said and he said
[45:19] he looked down there and he looked close
[45:21] to the wash bin and said there she was
[45:25] and he said
[45:27] that's what i'm looking for
[45:30] i'm looking for that character of
[45:32] somebody working
[45:33] and then what happened was to make the
[45:35] story short so we can continue on the
[45:37] armored meat packing guy fell in love
[45:39] with this girl
[45:42] and he said in one year i'll be back to
[45:44] pick you up
[45:46] now the problem with me and you is
[45:50] if the armored meat packing boy would
[45:52] have told us that
[45:55] we would have just said man we got it
[45:57] made
[46:00] no
[46:01] this girl
[46:02] the prophet continues with the story he
[46:05] said i don't know she may have made 75
[46:06] cents a week or 75 cents a day
[46:09] he said she saved up and bought her
[46:11] wedding dress
[46:13] she saved up and bought her bouquet
[46:16] she made herself ready
[46:20] she went up the statue of a perfect man
[46:22] she didn't set that one year and just
[46:24] say well we're the bride
[46:26] and one year from today he'll be back no
[46:29] the bible says the bride his wife has
[46:32] made herself ready
[46:34] and the prophet of god said oh within
[46:36] that one year
[46:37] said she got herself ready and she
[46:39] bought the dress she bought the the um
[46:42] flowers
[46:43] and said on that day she stood on the
[46:45] porch and said her little denominational
[46:47] sisters were just laughing and giggling
[46:48] saying ah he didn't really mean that he
[46:50] didn't really mean that he was he was
[46:52] coming back she said he said he'll be
[46:55] here
[46:57] and he said for me to be ready
[46:59] he said now she said no i've done my
[47:01] part
[47:02] it's his time to do his part and you
[47:04] know the story five minutes before the
[47:06] time to come up of the hour here comes
[47:08] the buck board
[47:11] here come the armor meat packing boy
[47:14] and she run and jumped in his arms
[47:17] and he said
[47:18] i'm going to take you home
[47:20] you ain't got to wash them dishes no
[47:22] more
[47:23] you ain't got to cry over a dead body
[47:25] anymore
[47:26] you ain't got to cry over a child that's
[47:28] wayward anymore
[47:30] you don't have to cry over needing
[47:32] something from god he said i'm here
[47:35] and that's what this is right here
[47:38] the
[47:38] his wife has made herself ready this
[47:40] girl
[47:42] i believe she worked more
[47:45] that one year to get herself ready than
[47:47] she had worked all the other time
[47:49] she wanted everything to be right
[47:52] but knowing he was coming
[47:55] he was coming together anyway
[47:59] but in one quote brother brown said he
[48:01] kept up with her during that year
[48:05] there's one quote i believe it's in the
[48:06] sixth seal where brother brown said oh
[48:08] he kept up with her
[48:09] he didn't just leave her and then not
[48:12] not he said no he kept up with her that
[48:14] whole year
[48:15] what just to make sure
[48:18] that she was making herself ready and
[48:19] that's what you and i are doing today
[48:21] is we're making it doesn't matter if you
[48:23] go if you listen to one tape
[48:25] or a week or one tape a day
[48:28] as long as you get what you're listening
[48:30] to
[48:31] as long as you let it become a part of
[48:33] you
[48:35] as long as you don't let the devil
[48:37] steal your joy
[48:40] because all the other girls were running
[48:41] around you know they probably were
[48:43] trying to get ready too but they he left
[48:45] them no instruction
[48:48] god left us instruction
[48:52] to get ready
[48:54] and be ready
[48:56] at the time that he comes
[48:58] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[49:00] and his wife has made herself ready
[49:04] blessed are they what you're called into
[49:05] the marriage supper now that's when we
[49:07] leave and go out of here to the marriage
[49:09] supper of the lamb
[49:11] forever how long a period of time until
[49:13] the battle of armageddon
[49:15] and all that other listen
[49:17] we've left that part
[49:20] when you take a body change
[49:22] and then you take a rapture
[49:24] you've left all that in this dimension
[49:27] that doesn't carry with you
[49:29] all that stuff
[49:32] the former things have passed away
[49:33] behold all things become new
[49:37] thank god
[49:39] that none of that carries with us
[49:42] see if you have to stand before judgment
[49:43] guess what if you die without god today
[49:47] that baggage stays with you
[49:52] all the way until the white throne
[49:54] judgment that baggage that you wouldn't
[49:56] let go of
[49:57] stays right there with you until the
[49:59] white throne judgment
[50:01] but if you'll give your heart to god and
[50:02] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:04] you'll never have to worry about that
[50:06] garbage anymore amen
[50:08] sure we're having a hard time in life
[50:10] sure there's things going on that never
[50:11] had happened before but listen
[50:13] something's fixing to happen and never
[50:15] has happened before
[50:16] we're getting out of here
[50:18] amen
[50:24] we're looking at something that
[50:27] amos talked of
[50:29] joel talked of
[50:33] nahum
[50:36] ezekiel
[50:38] isaiah because there's always scripture
[50:41] in there that pertains to me and you
[50:45] moses
[50:48] they talked about me and you
[50:50] oh sure they talked about israel but i
[50:52] thought we were the type
[50:55] isaiah told us about the future home
[50:57] told us about the millennium
[51:00] told us about jesus christ was going to
[51:01] come
[51:03] so what are we doing about it
[51:07] are we getting ourselves are we making
[51:08] ourselves more prepared now than we did
[51:10] when he became in love with us
[51:14] and said i want to be your husband
[51:16] and you accepted and said i want to be
[51:18] your wife
[51:20] is it more dear now than the year when
[51:22] he's going to come and pick us up
[51:24] no i believe she was absolutely like i
[51:26] said before she was so
[51:29] meticulous
[51:30] even right up to the moment
[51:34] with whatever she had to do with
[51:35] whatever you do you the word that you
[51:37] read the praying that you do the
[51:39] testifying all the things that we do
[51:42] what are we doing with it
[51:45] because listen he is gonna come and he's
[51:47] gonna pick up somebody
[51:52] he did get one of them four girls
[51:55] the other three got left behind
[51:57] but he did pick one of them up because
[51:59] that one made herself ready
[52:02] amen so what are we doing with it
[52:05] revelations let's read 16
[52:08] verse 13.
[52:11] all right
[52:12] and i saw three unclean spirits like
[52:14] frogs come out of the mouth of the
[52:15] dragon and out of the mouth of the beast
[52:17] now the mouth of the false prophet for
[52:19] they are the spirit of devils work in
[52:21] miracles
[52:22] which go forth unto the kings of the
[52:24] earth and the whole world
[52:25] to gather them to the battle of great
[52:27] day of arm of god almighty now look
[52:30] think about this a little bit yesterday
[52:33] we know what the what are those unclean
[52:35] spirits like frogs
[52:37] the trinitarian doctrine
[52:42] where did it come from
[52:46] out of the mouth of the beast the dragon
[52:48] and the false prophet
[52:50] for they are the spirit of devils
[52:52] working miracles look which go forth
[52:54] unto the kings of the earth and of the
[52:57] whole world
[52:59] to gather them together
[53:02] into a place called armageddon
[53:10] fighting over religious matters
[53:15] not just economical matters
[53:17] religious matters
[53:19] the three unclean spirits like frogs
[53:22] somebody's going to stand against all
[53:24] this because there's going to be a
[53:25] battle called armageddon
[53:27] and he said behold i come as a thief
[53:30] blessed is he that watcheth and keep us
[53:32] his garments lest he walk naked and they
[53:33] see his shame
[53:35] and he gathered them together into a
[53:36] place called in the hebrew tongue
[53:38] armageddon and the seventh angel poured
[53:40] out his vial
[53:43] which is going to be the last woe and
[53:44] there comes a great voice out of the
[53:46] temple of heaven from the throne saying
[53:48] it is done
[53:50] the battle of armageddon let's read now
[53:52] in victory day let's read what brother
[53:54] brown said about that
[53:58] we talk about several wars wars and
[54:00] rumors of wars v days v days v days and
[54:02] it'll finally wind up into the great
[54:03] battle of armageddon that'll be the last
[54:05] of it when she comes to the battle of
[54:07] armageddon that'll settle the whole
[54:09] thing
[54:10] just before the great millennium
[54:12] armageddon is to clean off the earth
[54:15] so what continues is what what i'm
[54:18] looking at that sixth seal is is that
[54:20] those two prophets release
[54:22] the power
[54:26] over nature
[54:28] and then when they leave it just
[54:31] continues on into
[54:33] this
[54:34] man starts fighting each other
[54:37] she re-purifies herself with atomic
[54:40] blowing we know this is going to be an
[54:41] atomic battle
[54:43] because tonight or this afternoon we're
[54:45] going to talk about a spiritual battle
[54:46] because look this this will kill
[54:49] human flesh beings
[54:53] not spirits
[54:56] not devils
[54:59] now we'll read
[55:00] in a little bit
[55:02] where they're bound
[55:04] and can't work because the people of the
[55:06] people on the earth but it doesn't kill
[55:09] them
[55:11] they have to be put in a place of
[55:12] holding for a thousand years
[55:15] because they have no one to work through
[55:17] but they're still very much alive but
[55:20] listen you and i
[55:21] are going to have to see that spot
[55:24] where all those
[55:25] demons are going to be destroyed
[55:28] all right
[55:30] so then look at again the millennium and
[55:32] the future home is you can you can
[55:35] intertwine some of the things and then
[55:37] some of the things you can't put
[55:39] together to say well it's going to
[55:41] happen in the millennium and it's going
[55:42] to happen in the future home because
[55:44] there's things in the millennium that
[55:45] can't carry over and there's things from
[55:47] the future home that can't back up into
[55:49] the millennium so thank god for a
[55:50] prophet that told us exactly
[55:54] that if we would build houses that's in
[55:55] the millennium
[55:57] the future home was built by god himself
[56:00] for us
[56:01] so it's two different things but see the
[56:04] lamb will be i mean the line will be
[56:05] gentle and the lamb this one will be
[56:07] tame it's takes both sides
[56:10] because when this world's destroyed and
[56:12] we come back to that thousand-year
[56:14] millennial reign
[56:15] it's going to be no war
[56:17] there's a lot of things that we'll read
[56:19] here the bible even tells us there won't
[56:21] be
[56:22] but those demons are still going to be
[56:24] there
[56:25] they're just not going to be able to
[56:26] work
[56:27] all right so let's keep reading she
[56:28] re-purifies herself with this atomic
[56:30] blowing and the volcanic ash and things
[56:32] sinks this soaked blood of men and upon
[56:35] the earth and sin and crime she sinks
[56:38] beneath the earth and the volcanic
[56:39] braids out again and renews and cleans
[56:41] the earth for the great millennium he
[56:43] cleans his church during that time
[56:46] for a people to live here amen i say
[56:48] like that yes sir there's coming a time
[56:51] when it will be
[56:53] great all right let's go to ezekiel 40.
[56:58] now this is
[57:00] we've seen the battle of armageddon
[57:02] everybody okay
[57:03] we've seen the battle of armageddon
[57:06] that's the termination of all forces
[57:08] that's when man dies that's when the
[57:09] flesh of man
[57:11] is destroyed
[57:13] by an atomic
[57:15] explosion all over the world
[57:18] all right everybody got that
[57:20] then there's something got to happen
[57:23] to finish the da and see this is in the
[57:25] middle of the daniel 70 weeks this is in
[57:27] the midst of the week there'll be a
[57:28] battle of armageddon that'll last
[57:30] the battle armageddon's not a one-day
[57:32] battle
[57:33] it's going to last a year or more
[57:35] because of nuclear fallout because of
[57:37] all the different things it's going to
[57:38] probably last maybe a year but somewhere
[57:40] down the line
[57:42] there's going to be a group of people
[57:44] come back in to this dimension
[57:47] according to daniel 70 weeks the last
[57:50] half of that 70th week
[57:53] and they're going to build a millennial
[57:54] temple
[57:56] and it's not going to be built by us
[57:58] but it will be built by them so this is
[58:00] ezekiel 40. like say again thank god for
[58:03] a prophet
[58:04] that could positionally place this
[58:06] because this is the building of a temple
[58:08] but we didn't know that it was going to
[58:09] be a millennial temple and we didn't
[58:11] know we were the ones that's going to
[58:12] rule and reign in it
[58:14] but according to daniel 70 weeks the
[58:16] last part the north the most holy is the
[58:18] anointing of us going into the temple
[58:21] because listen 144 000 if they built it
[58:25] they're going to be the servants
[58:29] not me and you
[58:31] we're not going to build anything in a
[58:33] honeymoon
[58:35] what be a wonderful thing don't ever if
[58:36] you get married don't ever tell your
[58:38] wife so all right tomorrow's the
[58:39] honeymoon we're going to build a house
[58:44] won't last long
[58:47] no what are you going to do you're going
[58:48] to lavish her with everything that you
[58:50] got
[58:51] that's the same way with god
[58:53] and the vision of god
[58:56] brought me into the land of israel so
[58:57] now where are we going back to
[58:59] we're going to israel
[59:01] because remember it's to thy people
[59:05] and the city
[59:07] and the city includes walls and
[59:09] buildings
[59:10] right
[59:12] all right
[59:13] so the people have been purged
[59:17] from the 144 000 they've been purged
[59:20] they took a rapture they're not here in
[59:22] this dimension but somebody's got to
[59:24] come back into this dimension and build
[59:27] this temple
[59:28] in jerusalem
[59:31] and the visions of god
[59:33] brought me into the land of israel
[59:36] and set me upon a very high mountain
[59:38] mount of olives whatever you want to
[59:40] call it
[59:42] by which was as the frame of a city on
[59:44] the south and he brought me thither and
[59:45] behold there was a man whose appearance
[59:48] was like into brass with a line of flax
[59:51] in his hand
[59:53] and a measuring reed and he stood on the
[59:55] gate and the man said unto me son of man
[59:58] behold with thine eyes and hear with
[1:00:00] thine ears and set thine heart upon all
[1:00:03] that i shall show thee
[1:00:05] for the intent that i might show them
[1:00:07] unto thee are thou brought hither
[1:00:10] declare all that thou seest to the house
[1:00:13] of who israel
[1:00:15] all right so now from that
[1:00:18] scripture
[1:00:19] down to ezekiel 44
[1:00:21] it talks about rooms it talks about
[1:00:23] putting a wall here it talks about
[1:00:25] putting a court here that's the building
[1:00:27] of that temple and they're going to
[1:00:29] build it
[1:00:30] the prophet of god said they're going to
[1:00:31] build it end up getting ready for the
[1:00:34] millennium
[1:00:35] they're going to have to build this city
[1:00:39] to make daniel
[1:00:40] 9 24-27
[1:00:42] come to pass
[1:00:44] because when they build that city and we
[1:00:46] go into that city
[1:00:48] that finishes those 490 years it takes
[1:00:51] the jews for the city and the people to
[1:00:53] come to full redemption everybody got
[1:00:55] that
[1:00:57] that's why daniel 70 weeks is so
[1:00:58] important as far as positionally placing
[1:01:01] things and to get it right
[1:01:03] when you do positionally place it okay
[1:01:06] so now let's go to revelations 19 11
[1:01:08] because somebody's got a ride back into
[1:01:11] this place
[1:01:13] all right after it's being built why
[1:01:15] would a why in the world would you spend
[1:01:17] a year or two building a building and
[1:01:19] then just leave it empty
[1:01:22] revelations 19 11 says i saw heaven
[1:01:26] open behold a white horse and he that
[1:01:28] set up on him was called faithful and
[1:01:29] true and in righteousness he does judge
[1:01:31] and make war
[1:01:32] who is this jesus christ we know that
[1:01:34] his eyes were his flame of fire in his
[1:01:36] head
[1:01:37] on his head were many crowns and he had
[1:01:39] a name written that no man knew but he
[1:01:41] himself
[1:01:42] and he was clothed with a vesture dipped
[1:01:44] in blood and his name was called the
[1:01:46] word of god in the beginning was the
[1:01:47] word where was with god the word was god
[1:01:50] that's jesus christ all right
[1:01:52] and the armies armies
[1:01:54] which were in heaven followed him upon
[1:01:56] white horses clothed and fined linen
[1:01:59] white and clean and out of his mouth go
[1:02:01] with a sharp sword
[1:02:02] and that with it he shall smite the
[1:02:04] nation so what's he coming to do he's
[1:02:06] not coming down to smite the nations
[1:02:09] that are there
[1:02:11] he's going to rule the 12 tribes of
[1:02:13] israel that is coming into that
[1:02:15] millennium
[1:02:16] everybody got that because remember the
[1:02:18] millenniums to the jews the jews are
[1:02:20] going to be ruled and reigned for a
[1:02:21] thousand years
[1:02:22] by the son of david sitting on the
[1:02:25] throne ruling the 12 tribes of israel so
[1:02:28] if you rule the 12 tribes of israel
[1:02:29] there's got to be something there to
[1:02:30] rule
[1:02:32] so this is what it is and the armies
[1:02:33] which were in heaven followed him and
[1:02:34] 0.1 horses which that's us
[1:02:37] clothed in fine linen white and clean
[1:02:40] and out of his mouth go with a sharp
[1:02:41] sword that with it he should smite the
[1:02:43] nations and he shall rule them with a
[1:02:45] rod of iron
[1:02:47] and he treadeth the wine press of the
[1:02:48] fierceness and wrath of almighty god and
[1:02:51] he hath on his vesture and on his style
[1:02:52] a name written
[1:02:54] and we've been through this a hundred
[1:02:56] times
[1:02:57] look at that all capital letters
[1:03:01] not king of little kings and lord of
[1:03:03] little lords no we have become one with
[1:03:06] the master
[1:03:07] we have become one with the king
[1:03:10] king of kings
[1:03:12] and lord of lords because for me and you
[1:03:14] buddy it's finished all we're waiting
[1:03:16] for is that future home to come
[1:03:18] listen to this number two and then we'll
[1:03:20] stop right here it's only that clock
[1:03:22] right
[1:03:23] it's only 20 minutes after 11.
[1:03:26] good grief
[1:03:28] wow
[1:03:30] all right on the 70th week of daniel now
[1:03:32] notice that's where we've seen her
[1:03:34] coming back to the millennial temple
[1:03:36] over here at the end of the what
[1:03:39] what is the jewish age the 70 weeks of
[1:03:43] i i don't see why people don't see that
[1:03:46] the jewish age the gentile age finished
[1:03:48] when we left
[1:03:51] then there's a time of the 490 years 483
[1:03:55] is already done three and a half years
[1:03:57] was preached by the two witnesses
[1:03:58] there's three and a half years left
[1:04:00] after the battle of armageddon
[1:04:02] now that's finished and at the end of
[1:04:04] the jewish age
[1:04:06] they have been saved
[1:04:08] filled with the holy ghost and built the
[1:04:10] city they finished daniel 9 24
[1:04:14] through 27.
[1:04:16] over here at the end of the jewish age
[1:04:17] the anointed here he comes riding on the
[1:04:20] white horse now he's talking about
[1:04:21] revelations 19 we just read it those
[1:04:23] followed him on white horses horses
[1:04:25] powers
[1:04:27] dressed in white blood or vesture dipped
[1:04:29] in blood wrote on him the word of god
[1:04:31] he cometh the mighty conqueror yes sir
[1:04:34] to set up the millennium coming to the
[1:04:36] temple
[1:04:38] there he meets that 144 thousand so 144
[1:04:42] 000 has to be down here building the
[1:04:43] city god's going to be somewhere with us
[1:04:46] the bride because we're going to ride
[1:04:47] into that from the dimension we're in
[1:04:50] into this dimension
[1:04:52] down here
[1:04:53] and there he meets the 144 000 and then
[1:04:56] if you keep going on a little bit
[1:04:58] further
[1:04:59] uh i didn't bring that quote but he said
[1:05:01] the anointing to the temple was me and
[1:05:03] you
[1:05:06] he's anointed we're anointed because of
[1:05:09] the kings and kings and lord of lords
[1:05:11] we've come to a position that we're
[1:05:13] going to rule and reign with him for
[1:05:14] that thousand years but now remember
[1:05:16] we're not going to rule like he's going
[1:05:18] to rule because he rules the 12 tribes
[1:05:20] of israel as the son of david sitting on
[1:05:24] the throne of david ruling the twelve
[1:05:26] tribes of israel you and i are just
[1:05:28] there on the honeymoon because you can
[1:05:30] if you get a little further we'll read
[1:05:32] we'll read this afternoon we'll um let's
[1:05:35] read the millennium a little bit about
[1:05:36] it and then we'll stop
[1:05:38] because that millennium there's a lot of
[1:05:40] things that goes on let's go to the
[1:05:42] chart just for a second
[1:05:45] and go all the way over to the
[1:05:50] right here millennium
[1:05:51] so we got
[1:05:53] battle of armageddon
[1:05:55] everything everybody's killed this is
[1:05:57] the purging of the earth and all that
[1:05:59] die they go into the fifth dimension
[1:06:01] because there's nowhere else to put
[1:06:02] these people because they're not bribed
[1:06:04] they're not foolish virgin now they
[1:06:05] could be cup of water in my name
[1:06:08] i mean foods virgins in there in the in
[1:06:10] the cup of water in my name they're not
[1:06:12] up here with us they don't resurrect
[1:06:16] because the bible tells it says the
[1:06:18] second death
[1:06:19] has no hold on me and you so there is a
[1:06:22] second death which means that these
[1:06:24] people that die all down through here
[1:06:26] that are not born again they're going to
[1:06:28] have to stay in that fifth dimension
[1:06:30] until the white throne judgment right
[1:06:32] here
[1:06:34] all right then they're going to have to
[1:06:35] be judged
[1:06:37] you and i don't have to be judged but
[1:06:39] the 140 i mean the and 144 thousand but
[1:06:42] the foolish virgin
[1:06:43] and
[1:06:44] the cup of water in my name given
[1:06:46] eternal life for being good to the bride
[1:06:48] whatever you want to call it they're not
[1:06:50] showing up in this millennium
[1:06:54] everybody got that
[1:06:56] now the fifth sealed jew
[1:06:58] you can make an argument for that
[1:07:01] you can make an argument for the heathen
[1:07:02] being raised up which i don't understand
[1:07:04] that but listen just make sure you get
[1:07:06] there because remember it's not to me
[1:07:08] and you it's not going to stop me from
[1:07:10] taking a body change if i can't tell you
[1:07:14] who's going to be in the millennium
[1:07:16] okay
[1:07:17] it's me getting myself ready here i got
[1:07:20] my revelations 19 they got their self
[1:07:22] ready then they rode into the millennium
[1:07:24] and surprise
[1:07:26] okay but that's what's going to happen
[1:07:29] there's going to be 1 000 satan is bound
[1:07:33] there's going to be a thousand year
[1:07:34] millennial reign so let's read
[1:07:38] where this comes from
[1:07:40] ii peter 3 verse 8 says behold
[1:07:43] beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:07:45] thing that one day is with the lord as a
[1:07:46] thousand years and a thousand years
[1:07:49] as one day genesis 2 verse 17
[1:07:52] says but of the tree of the knowledge of
[1:07:54] good and evil thou shalt not eat of it
[1:07:56] for in the day
[1:07:58] that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
[1:07:59] surely die now we we got to make this
[1:08:01] scriptural
[1:08:04] a thousand years of the day days a
[1:08:05] thousand years
[1:08:07] now
[1:08:08] they didn't physically die the day they
[1:08:10] committed adultery the day eve committed
[1:08:12] adultery and the day adam did what he
[1:08:13] did they didn't physically die
[1:08:15] they spiritually died
[1:08:17] and they started dying on the outside
[1:08:19] guy but that very day because remember
[1:08:22] that curse was put on them
[1:08:25] and methuselah got closer than anybody
[1:08:28] 969 years and then adam was 900 and
[1:08:31] something years and this was 800 and
[1:08:33] something years they got close to it
[1:08:35] but they couldn't live that thousand
[1:08:37] years because the curse they cursed the
[1:08:39] ground
[1:08:41] didn't curse adam
[1:08:43] curse the ground
[1:08:44] well that's where they all started
[1:08:46] coming from well and adam was spoken
[1:08:49] into existence everybody else started
[1:08:50] coming out of the ground amen
[1:08:53] you come out of the ground your body
[1:08:54] come out of the ground
[1:09:01] so let's go to isaiah 65 then we'll stop
[1:09:03] right here musicians get ready to come
[1:09:04] when i get finished reading this and
[1:09:05] then we'll start right here tonight this
[1:09:07] afternoon
[1:09:10] for behold
[1:09:12] i create new heavens and a new earth
[1:09:14] and the former shall not be remembered
[1:09:16] nor come into mind
[1:09:19] but be ye glad and rejoice forever
[1:09:22] in that which i create
[1:09:24] for behold i create
[1:09:26] jerusalem
[1:09:28] that's where we're going to be
[1:09:31] jerusalem a rejoicing and her people
[1:09:35] a joy
[1:09:37] now who's the jeru who's the people that
[1:09:38] dwell in jerusalem jews so the
[1:09:40] millennium is to the jews it's not to me
[1:09:42] and you okay
[1:09:45] and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy
[1:09:47] in my people who is isaiah jew
[1:09:51] and the voice of weeping shall be no
[1:09:53] more hurt in her nor the voice of crying
[1:09:55] there shall be no more than an infant
[1:09:57] that's an infant of days nor an old man
[1:09:59] that hath not filled his days now i
[1:10:01] can't get into that because i don't
[1:10:02] understand that
[1:10:04] for the child shall die a hundred years
[1:10:06] old
[1:10:07] but the sinner being a hundred years old
[1:10:08] shall be accursed see the prophet of god
[1:10:10] that's why he could somebody ask him
[1:10:12] said
[1:10:13] well could there be babies born in the
[1:10:15] millennium he said looks like they can
[1:10:18] looks like they can't
[1:10:20] so if he answered it that way i'm not
[1:10:22] going to argue with him it really
[1:10:24] doesn't matter to me
[1:10:27] and this doesn't either
[1:10:29] but it would be good that god would
[1:10:30] reveal it if somebody knew what that was
[1:10:33] but i didn't think anybody was going to
[1:10:34] die in the millennium so it says a man
[1:10:37] to die 100 years old
[1:10:38] a sinner being 100 years old shall be
[1:10:40] accursed
[1:10:42] so
[1:10:43] maybe we can deal with that later on
[1:10:46] and they shall build houses now look and
[1:10:48] they shall build houses and inhabit them
[1:10:51] and they shall plant vineyards and eat
[1:10:53] the fruit of them now that's not going
[1:10:54] to happen in the future home
[1:10:57] that's going to happen in the millennium
[1:10:58] because it's still time it is a day it
[1:11:02] is a time you have weeks and months and
[1:11:04] days
[1:11:06] because somebody's got to live a
[1:11:07] thousand years
[1:11:09] they shall not build and another inhabit
[1:11:12] in other words
[1:11:14] die and give it to their kids
[1:11:16] they shall not plant and another eat for
[1:11:18] as the days of a tree are the days of my
[1:11:20] people and mine elect
[1:11:22] shall long enjoy the work of their hands
[1:11:26] that's not me and you
[1:11:27] now that's the elect of god for for that
