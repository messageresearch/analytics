is is is precious his wings under his face save me now he never asked for anything when he comes here we always give you an offer to the church but we also every time he comes we always set aside a certain amount of money to give to him to take over to the foreign field and he always gives a report back of where it goes so we don't have to worry about it or he spends it and things like that so was it all right with the church for to give him like a check for fifteen hundred dollars yes all right with everybody any opposition no opposition then we'll give him that he can take it over and give it to some of them because he does like he said he buys rice he goes in they build do churches and buy things for people bicycles and things and we appreciate it because he travels around a lot right if you can't go just send something that's the best way to do it so let's just sing open the eyes of my heart and brother george quinn comes to be with us and just pray that the lord would bless us and open our understanding right open the eyes of my heart how is don't know if i've heard that or not before but uh certainly it's a beautiful song amen and can i just move back down a little bit yes thank you very much samuel praise the lord uh god made me the way i am small i suppose kind of i was reading uh about uh abraham lincoln and he said um he said if i had another fist he said i'd wear it i think if you're uh president of this present time i came into office and i said to someone not that i agree with them or disagree with him but i said you just watch his hair before he leaves it will be white yeah because of the of the weird of the office amen i said you're the president it's a big office so praise the lord amen but we're glad to be here this afternoon thank you for uh receiving the word this morning i believe you'll receive this this afternoon as well and uh praise the lord i'm glad in one sense that uh i never really ever heard this i preached like this today but uh i'm glad to put it together it's not nothing that's good that's going to be unfamiliar with you but it's just the way we put it together trust it'll be a blessing to you so just as you're standing amen uh and if the lord does want us to the holy spirit i believe in the holy spirit like you do and if he takes me off and sometimes and about some little story about the the the mission feeling he wants you to know it you'll bring it to me you know we'll just see how we go but we're gonna watch the time i'm glad to be here today to the communion service and the food washing i'm very pleased to be with you for that today and certainly i thank uh brother samuel for the offering amen and i promise you as i've often always done i promise that someone somewhere over there will be blessed because you give today amen so just thank you that you're a part of that amen of that giving in john's gospel amen we've been using this a lot over here and uh praise the lord because it's it's a a preacher always wants deliverance from what's on his heart another way he's got the burden he wants to give it out and once he's done that that's that's it praise the lord and it says in uh one job this is the gospel of john 9 and the first chapter and so i'm sorry maybe i said one joint assistant it's the gospel amen and i'll just give you a second and it says the next day a john saith jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which takes away the sin of the world amen this is he of whom i said after me cometh of mine which is preferred before me for he was before me amen and i knew him not but that he should be manifest to israel therefore i might come baptize him with water and john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it appeared upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptiste with water to see him said unto me upon whom i shall see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost and i saw on bare record that this is the son of god amen praise the lord gracious heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this day and this first day of the week lord and father god we just thank you we're in church again lord and we just pray that you will bless your holy word take full control lord we are aware and the families went up lit last night and lord jesus many of us have traveled and we've just had our lunches and lord our bodies are the weak part our spirits are willing but lord i just pray that the anointing will be such that dear god you'll carry us all through it lord in the name of jesus christ i ask you that you will bless your word lord may we never forget all the days of our life in the name of jesus christ we ask it amen praise the lord you may be seated and god bless you praise the lord amen praise the lord and thank you very much thank you appreciate that very much amen praise the lord uh first of all let me just give a title to it you know brother joe always comes over he wants to get the title of the message and i think a lot of preachers forget to give the title you know right but it's good to give the title okay and uh the title is uh the complete work ministry and person of the lamb of god now notice the word i used there at the beginning the complete work not part of the work the complete work amen and uh to get you this today i've got an awesome task because uh i i preached over india this message and i preached it for two hours and when i got to the end of it i promise you'll not do that today because i just started there and i amen and when i got to the end of it the pastor said to me you may continue if you wish and there that was me preaching for two hours solid hard 400 people drawn it out if you you know and he said but he translated he said you may continue if you wish so so i've had to abbreviate it amen and i've i'm just all i'm going to do is give you the headaches basically so if you i don't want you to go away said i wish that brother said more about this because i can't because you wouldn't get the headaches so that's all i'm going to give you the high points today but praise the lord uh this is a wonderful uh statement i was never spoken like this by anybody john the baptist was the first one that came and said this behold the lamb of god amen that takes away the sons of the world amen and uh you know when i look at our young people and uh praise the lord we were talking about uh our on the internet and putting up our thing on the on the internet and not there but our churches and uh the brother wanted to do it for me uh you know it was all brother brahman you know god's prophet 20th century you know i said brother i don't want to project that just yet right i said i want to tell the people what we believe right now we're christians hallelujah we believe in jesus christ we believe you got to get saved believe you got to be blood washed we believe you've got to get baptized in the name of the lord jesus that's what i want the people to see first hallelujah and then we'll take them all into the the word hallelujah and god sent his prophet amen to this hour but anyway so uh praise the lord when i began to think about that i'd heard a little different snippets here and there of things and i read so many of them and um you know if you think of all the titles that the lord carries you know jesus he must carry many many tapes right and he does he's called the son of god for one right amen the son of man he's also called the alpha and omega the beginning of the end uh it's called the village the valley it's called the brandy morning star he's got many titles but if you look at the title that i just read today there is no greater title in the bible that you will read more than this title the lamb of god all right hallelujah and so that is that is the first thing about it there's no greater title that he ever uses than the lamb of god amen and the reason why i mentioned the internet uh today is because i want to break it down maybe some of our younger people here today uh maybe has never thought of it that but why it would have to be blood why does everything have to die on a blood alarm and a man bloody why does that have to be and a young person could ask that question you see and so amen uh we know that this book is a book of redemption hallelujah we're so glad about that praise god you read the bible and there's hope amen there's redemption in the bible because it's a book of redemption and i've got all these quotes here i can read you a quote after quote of it harder the brother brandon puts it to us amen and uh praise the lord why is it a book of redemption because adam forfeited the title deed to the earth he was lord of this earth amen amen he was lord over it hallelujah amen king whatever you want to call him but he was lord he had complete dominion over all the animals over all the hills he couldn't dominion over everything but he lost it that's like the football term is he fumbled the ball he lost the ball and the ball went back into the hands of the original owner amen and so praise the lord uh amen it went right back there and and that is the thing when he lost the ball and the fall came i want to just give you a little quote in a moment amen uh that i feel i should relate to you amen and ah god had to come down i mean redemption didn't start with mine right redemption started with god hallelujah when he come down and said where are they adam and he said we had believed at least he was honest with god we ought to be honest with god right and he said we had because we were naked and he said who told you that you were naked and they had their little uh uh a thing sewn on that there but god give them coats right and that shows that that that in mine that god had a a a a a greeted purpose hallelujah a greater plan and mine was in a pickle a real pickle i mean when paul writes words like uh that we were without god when we were the third hope hallelujah in this world man i'll tell you you're in the right pickle you are in a bad spot right right but thank god without hope we're talking about hell last night come on you know without god that's hell right hey man it doesn't matter if you're burning or not what are you feeling or you're with that god whatever what a sense that would be american terrible right and so amen and and so here he was and and god makes the little coats i'm going to speak about it in a moment praise the lord and on redemption redemption basically means that uh you were born brought out of the slave market of sin right by the way back in them days that's how much a slave cost would be 30 pieces of silver in the roman day amen and you could buy a person amen ah praise god for that amount of money amen what a terrible thing praise the lord what a terrible thing amen our redemption is buying that person well we were in the slave market of sin we were there amen i i'm not praise god someone paid the price hallelujah someone's saying your pardon amen and you can go free and that's not wonderful i can go free today amen and so uh we know in this uh i i cannot understand how anybody cannot see his servants i mean you can't see that praise god right hallelujah hey you know adam be the son of god amen every seed bringing forth after it's kind of my manhood pops kian amen is he like his daddy a new way he tells lies he's jealous he's got hitler in his heart and eventually murders his brother but i'm just like my daddy he wasn't like because adam was the son of god adam didn't hit anybody adam didn't be jealous of anybody and autumn certainly never murdered anybody so you can see right away that there there's there's a difference here hallelujah where did king come from then have you even read the scripture and see that he's the seventh you tied them all up amen and he's not praise god if you put king into the line i would be the hit from out of it enough idiots we know all these things folks hallelujah still plain but again it has to take god to show people things like that amen but we believe the certainty but here it is and adam has sinned and and and you know it's terrible and brother branham saying here that uh the fall of man necessitated the blood the life sacrifice as a covering percent and i want to read this because i'm going to take my time to do that this is this is reading here but satan could not come through human flesh to make the fall as would christ common human flesh to restore the fallen is not right he ain't no creator okay so we know that but there was an animal the servants so close to man that satan could get into that base and bring the beast to get the human flesh to cause the fall right so we can see that hallelujah right and and inject himself thereby into the human race even as jesus would come one day and inject himself into the human race amen so and he says here um amen let me see and into our human bodies uh even to the extent of a resurrection wherein we would have bodies like his glorious father so i'm glad he's rejected me that much of himself that one day i'll be raised from the day amen just like job praise god now i made mention job i might not at all open now praise the lord and then he says here uh uh he said thus what god worked out in the garden was his predestinative plan and when satan had brought about that which is necessary to the purpose of god for he was a redeemer right he he was a father hallelujah he had attributes he was a savior and they were all going to come out and i saw god let them come about again and so then amen the whole purpose that at that time that man could not get to the tree of life certainly not it wasn't time but anonymous and then he says animal had caused the fall had it not let animal life be shed right so just read on and was taken on his bloodshed and then god had communion with man again so because that servant was an animal and by his blood intermingling he actually uses that term here it was the degradation of humanity by intermingling the seed and so that's the case hallelujah then it would take exactly the same thing that uh that god would use anonymous it would be his blood and it would then come on to the lamb of god amen who would bypass sin who was born sin the same man and then he says i will put enmity against her seed and the serpent seed and they had to wait for that fullness of time god give a propitiation of sin through the shed blood of a lion so i hope that i have explained that to any young person sitting here that it was blood of a beast of a serpent that caused the fall amen and god to start it back on the path he used another little animal amen with its blood an innocent little animal that hadn't done anything itself but it was going to be used and god permitted it to cover sin praise the lord so i just wanted to get i just wanted to get that one out of the road amen praise the lord and uh amen so we see here uh uh that autumn and you know brother branham and i love it hallelujah i mean brother brought him to tell us where we're message believers and god and brother groningen told me that eve's hair was blown and i believe it amen yeah amen hey brother brother says and that's how precious he is to us if we receive a prophet in the name of a prophet we receive a prophet's reward and so i amen for him to tell us that he saw adam and eve leave the garden leave the garden they were told you must leave the garden what a terrible thing to be turned around in the presence of god and said you must leave my presence what a heartache it would be right and i i could warn and describe it but i haven't got the time but it must have been horrible and there was adam and eve cried and holding on to one another and i'm slowly going toward the gate hey man said hot foot we have done that look so a paradise away how can we have done it but they did do it and you say i wouldn't have done it yes you would because you were in adam you see and i was in adam right and and we went that way i i chose our own way amen you shall be as god so my it sounds great doesn't it amen but we will be as gods we are gods praise the lord so so here it is amen and adam had a lamb he had that little coats and he describes it and he's saying about how as he walked out toward that gate crying and weeping and holding on to him and you know there was just a little blood left to fall onto the ground and all of a sudden he said that he heard that lovely loving voice of god saying wait a moment hallelujah wait a moment hallelujah and turn around and say the seed of the woman will embrace the circumcision hallelujah right he might not understood it but he knows there's hope and that i'm going to have i'm going to hold on to that amen and thank god adam amen praise the lord and then uh so the next person we read is evil of course we read him oh come in and uh the lovely thing about it is it was a revelation to evil hallelujah that uh you know his mommy or dad didn't tell him about it brother brown said he said it was god showed him about that serpent scene and and and he knew then that if that's the kiss then it's going to have to be a little animal and that's what he used and it says that evil by faith offered up a better sacrifice amen why because it was god's provided way it had to be a lamb and it had to be a life now why was it not a billy goat or why was it not something else it had to be a lamb i'm never gonna find it why as we go on into it amen and then of course uh as i say we could stop anywhere here and and build it up i've got i got all my notes on it but i'm not doing that until anybody touch the head and so then we come into moses moses passover lamb amen and i think i remember preaching that the conditions for the exodus exactly as they were then god don't change as we said this morning we've got the conditions if you are driving the conditions pastor reid exodus 12 i'd see if you match up right see if you've got your password i don't see if you're right in there amen and then when the call of the league comes you're on your way hallelujah right amen and it was wonderful praise the lord and of course i just uh i overlapped there uh abraham's lamb thank god that when he took off isaac onto the hell i i had more mariah and and you know he said my father i see the the fire right i see the wood where is the sacrifice and he said my son god himself will become the sacrifice and he was hallelujah hallelujah praise god all right you know our friends and i just want to say this i praise the lord when jesus died on calvary and i know brother brother said that the theophany not that it just lifted off and they're in the garden of gethsemane but i'll tell you what then if you're reading what paul said and you think well it said then jesus died for the ungodly it doesn't say that it says in jews season christ died for the ungodly hallelujah because the divine part separates from the human part don't mean that he's a lord figure or anything else he's still the christ he was born the christ he was the christ and he died to christ on the cross of california amen and so there it was and he called the name of the place jehovah jarrah amen right there they built the temple that temple i talked about this morning hallelujah were they the altar was and the sacrifices took place that is where abraham offered that little love and you know it all i couldn't survive up there in the wilderness but god and me alone god gave it to abraham and we can see that the blood was shed and even with with evil harry had the last hand on it my and his little heart beating slower and slower as he took that sharp stone and cut his throat folks i'll tell you what amen calvary's cross cost them a lot it cost them a lot amen and so praise the lord and identifying with it lord god just forgive me and take take this blood and this life of this little lamb in my place and god said i will i'll do it hallelujah you're justified before me but it's only a covering right and so they're covering year by year they have to go back amen praise the lord amen and uh will i said i mentioned your birthday i think i'm just going to squeeze them in today i praise the lord if you like me too you know job was a man you know a story it's a wonderful story and and you know it's good that god brother branham says that god has got confidence in you praise god when you go to the store tomorrow you might hear people cursing and swearing you might i did the other day i walked in the air and there was a couple of people on courses swearing amen i don't hear it often but there they were and uh anything could be going like that there but you're a christian you can hold your head high and god has got confidence in you hallelujah praise the lord he certainly has and he had confidence in job amen and i may say this because maybe one or two may need it today praise the lord that uh we were preaching about uh gideon and uh you know you know the story of gideon i'm sure you do very well but uh the bible says brother brown says that gideon needed extra confidence now sometimes you can get these things for sucking and all that and it says extra strong okay you all know what i'm going through here right here strong that's the one i want extra strong but i'll tell you you might have come to this church this afternoon and you need confidence not only confidence brother gary you may need extra confidence well you've come to the right place hallelujah you've come to the right place amen you can have it where you're sitting you're going to go up to the front you can go to the back you can go home in your car but you can get the absolute confidence that you need he give it to gideon he'll give it to you and i praise the lord and so there was job and you know oh it's terrible when you read it and all those friends and wouldn't have friends you know i remember the night when my wife was sick and i'll tell you what there's one person and knowing that i was down and i was on my knees and i'll tell you what they just beat me with a big stick as if it was my fault right and everything and what are you gonna do wrong oh i would i listen to you but you know just like like just like david and shimmy i i didn't say nothing i didn't say nothing amen but i'll tell you what amen and that's what his friends were like job's friends but you know again what we said earlier when that inspiration struck job he jumped to his feet and he said i know i know i don't think i know my redeemer lives the funeral service is over for him now maybe it's still going on but about two o'clock on and you know there he's going to stand in this earth again hallelujah matter of fact it doesn't matter hallelujah he's going to stand on the earth again and in my flesh i will see god amen amen wonderful because if you've got a redeemer you've got redemption and redemption came through the blood of allah amen okay praise the lord now well where did it all start you know that's one thing i love about this message because if you're going to talk about the lamb of god you've got to start an eternity right you can't start yesterday before i'll hallelujah right back you know and praise the lord the gods program god's plan of redemption was laid out before the world began now they can say whatever they want if it's two million years over 24 million years old that doesn't bother me at all all i know is that before the world began god had said it the lamb of god right absolutely hard and you know the scripture says that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world amen he was slain amen i'd love to take a good give him a note and start reading some of these quotes to you but i can't and what would it mean well just basically what it means we were talking about a little bit about the eternal thought that god's not us folks you know even when we're reading revelation 10 7 that angel came down and i believe that with all my heart you know but when you're talking about almighty god where are you going to go that was president right there right you know people want to go and they want to send out something that mars i don't know why yeah and even i i i seen a documentary at one time they said even if they were there they only stayed about a dozen years they'd have to come back they will have to come back so what was all a lot about going up to mars he wants to go to mars you know but i know one thing if you went to mars i bet you could feel the spirit of god on you if you're a christian all right because he's everywhere hallelujah bless the lord amen and here the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world in god's mind the eternal god hallelujah god's not like us he doesn't have to leave somewhere to go somewhere else amen but that's language that we understand so therefore we use it amen and so praise god here is he was an eternal thought of god amen and it was determined that christ would be that lamb hallelujah no knowing all that was going the whole thing was going to be larry how the earth would be created amen and all it would be put on it that he would sin that he would need the little coats then he would have the revelation and abraham moses would have the revelation the pastor of the lamb and it would come right on down to his son and so praise god he was saying in the mind of god and when it's like that sister apparently it's done right with god once he thinks that that's it praise god amen once he speaks of hallelujah you'll never that's why folks when when we have thus served the lord on this country i tell you there's no hope right right there is no hope there's no hope for ireland there's no hope for the west right hallelujah we're on the course and abraham lincoln and george washington and every they would not turn this nation back today and you know exactly praise god so it's been spoken hallelujah goodbye california amen well amen now i this is the nice part so praise god where did i come from then you know what i'm gonna we stood up a fellow here and uh remember where did i come from or brother where did i tell you what i came from the mind of god right hey man as a matter of fact i will give you a little thought and you can do whatever you want with it but you know i was reading and it said that if you look at when god said to moses i am that i am sending you tell them that the lord god has sent you amen and you know we know jehovah i'm not just explaining it like this that word for for for ram there i am that word is the same that mo that when moses when god said so down your rod it's exactly the same word it is that became a serpent it's exactly the same word as i am i am you say that i sent you so what is he saying what's in that it became something okay so he said i became what i've become right okay i i'm the lord your god amen right and that's what we've always known about jehovah he's the self-revealing god we know that that's he's the self-revealing god but what did he become folks he became his own thoughts hey that's the truth he became his own thoughts what he was thinking and his mind he determined to do and he did it that's wonderful amen and that's what he was trying to tell moses i'm i'm going to become my own thoughts right when i thought it went back and eternally i'm going to do it hallelujah and that's why christ was sacrificed and the lamb slain right in god's mind before the word began but listen i may throw this three but in here and i'm watching the time to get in praise god you see someone else helping the way back there i'm just saying where did we come from where did i come from you say and the prophet said that when he was slain in god's mind he said we were the ones he was slain for right right the elect that's the way he puts it so praise god he was elected to be the lamb right and friends you were elected to be the ones that that lamb would be sleeping i think that's lovely i'm glad somebody said we're saying over there oh yes one of them the ones that were chosen the way back for that amen and the bride the elected ones that he was slammed for right in the mind of god hallelujah praise god and here we are the day as a fulfillment of life it says it's materialized we are the materialization of the thoughts of god absolutely amen and well i better get on it right quick here and you know in the fullness of time oh how we love it praise god the lamb came forth born of a woman hallelujah why it had to be shepherds amen i love the story i hate the fact that they got christmas all mixed up and i know how you don't stand here and i agree with that over christmas amen but you know something you can't get away from the beauty of that christmas story can you amen the the shepherds all humble together not very warm and you know and here they were and then the angels and go down and there is i'm saying for unto you this day and the city of the event is born a savior a savior which is christ the lord amen that's who it is nobody else but i'll tell you what this is the lamb of god he's born today in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord wonderful here he was now why alone why alone well you know we should be able to figure out it ourselves because amen of its nature right amen but you know when god made an eagle and he was going to take you a sad eagle he made that eagle that way so if you could take yourself in to be the need amen and when he made a salmon and whatever it is praise god on the rainbow trout and when he made a lamb it was because it had a nature and carried in nature would express his thoughts amen and that's what he did and it was a praise of the lord uh represented his own characteristics bless the lord and it was a gentile a gentle natured meek praise the lord uh little fella and i must say we'll take it back home we have our sheep my wife loves them and we have the little lambs and we have a few horses and there's one that doesn't like it like any of us nearly well she actually like said sarah but you know even me going by and i stop brother samuel and talk to the horse and i say amber why do you not like me i mean i'm a servant of god i'm not even thank you i've never pushed you like that i speak nice to you and you see i know what you ever do yeah i know what it tastes like and that's what she's like and we were standing there one day and of course jonathan thought he was going to prove me wrong and so he said oh no no no amber's all right you know what i'm good now i know she's already turned you put him here he was black and blue i suppose but i wish it wasn't right but anyway amen but you know i lied hold on you can live a million years i'll tell you what not one person will come up and say to you boy that lamp hit me there did you see that that long but no alarm will not beat you alarm is gentle right it's forgiving and it's trusting oh my goodness there's not much trust in this alarm you know you can pick it up off its mother and it'll just put his little head in here and i'll go ah and you'll be stroking it so so lovely and that in god's mind he said that i'm gonna make that little animal because it will it will be my characteristics and people will be able to type it against me and that's why it was the lamb of god that's why i had to be a lamb that's why it had to be blood and i hope you've all got that today i'm sure the older ones have amen praise the lord amen in the fullness of time praise god and of course there was the alarm and the dove and as the prophet said you ain't going to get that dub down if you don't have alarm right nature praise the lord and you know also if you just run it on i'm getting ahead of myself here but if you run around folks and you get into the 19th chapter of the book of revelation it says it says the lamb's wife and the lamb and it says for his wife it's going to be a lamb so i tell you what i have no time for a christian not you know i'm listening to them they're as hard as anything you know what i mean shooting from the bang bang bang where's that in the scripture where's that in the lord's nature praise god hallelujah we don't need that amen hallelujah and the holy ghost dove will lead us but you've got to have that nature today right and you should have and i'm sure you do have on you today praise the lord and the bible says and he was led as a lamb before her shearers was done he opened not his mouth wow what a wonderful savior we have and and our praise the lord that's just that's just getting into that i better get on fairly much here the lamb of god comes into full view and you know he was presented at the river jordan that's where he came now brown said he could march him during the banker with uh with with uh uh uh was it lazarus i mean martha's brother hey that's this is his friend they marched down i don't know if blasters keep updates and brother brother didn't say but i know jesus did hallelujah amen praise the lord and he was introduced john was willing he knew something was going to happen and he was waiting for the sign and he was there about passing away and that's sometimes when god comes to you when you're just maybe not fully aware and then he sits on the scene and here he was and he introduced in the song but not only that he saw him but he saw the sign hallelujah to see him with brother branham they're parallel so much hallelujah i don't look at the mind if you wish not the look of the mind but look at the sign hallelujah but where did it ever feel amen it never failed okay and praise the lord the same was the spirit of god descending on christ and he announced him to the world hallelujah that's what john was to do announcing to the world and uh that's what he did and he saw the prophet said he saw the pillar of fire in the shape of a dove come down hanging over uh the lord jesus amen man and there was the voice and folks i'll tell you what you know a lot of people even over time over and over vietnam they were asking me about that trying to prove a trinity by this story that there was the sun in the water the holy ghost is like a dove and the father speaks their strength amen well i'll tell you what that's a bad very bad interpretation you're putting on the word hallelujah it came down like a pillar of fire over him and right out of the middle of that part of our voice spoke and spoke unto the birth of jesus christ this is my beloved son and whom i am pleased to dwell hallelujah and there he was amen and our praise god uh the the the father amen and the son bless the lord and he's receiving the spirit without measure right he did he needed that praise god and his humanity amen we know that when jesus was on the boat he he's a human being he had to eat he had to sleep he had to that's right but you know when he stood up there and spoke hallelujah that was god and we know right bless the lord amen and so here he was and he received that and you know the thing about it is the sacrifice had to be watched had to be washed amen and it was only symbolic with him he had nothing to be washed for but because he was fulfilling the law he fulfilled that and he was wise amen praise god before uh god and not only that there but if you even go back into the uh description of the high priest in the old testament that man was washed first then he was anointed with oil and then he was in his office hallelujah praise god of the high priest and i'm not saying jesus was watched he was anointed by the holy ghost the third measure with third measure and praise god and he's in his office he's read among them he's the son of god in his office hallelujah all right the son of man whatever way you want to look at but there he is amen he's god's chosen place of worship now and the whole sin question is settled here is the law there's no other way this is the one amen praise god thank god for that and the lovely thing about it is we will know i want to just get on very quickly here that in the old testament when that little animal when you identified was yourself with it and god accepted that as a covering for your sin but we know that the life of that animal couldn't come back on the believer right it's only a little animal right right so that's all it is come on brother praise the lord amen i was talking to one of our horses one of our dogs actually i beg your pardon and i said holly i said would you like to be with me in the millennium on up here folks praise the lord and you know the bread said with the lambs with white amen and so praise the lord but that was the whole thing all throughout ten years four thousand years or whatever it was that the blood the life couldn't come back from the believer you see but thank god when you get in touch with islam when you identify with islam hallelujah as your sacrifice his life comes back on you when you make that identification as the lamb of god you understand that praise god is wonderful hallelujah amen and i'm glad in the form of the holy ghost he comes back on the believer amen and the sharing of his blood we will never cease to sing about the blood halloween amen the blood that was shed amen what can wash away my stain nothing but the blood of jesus and you can go on in there i'm sure your pastor has i'm just putting these thoughts together the complete work and amen acts chapter 20 amen god's own blood that he purchases his church with right amen by the blood of god he purchased his church amen so that's wonderful hallelujah and there we are amen eternal redemption every redemptive blessing is paid for my wonderful you get something paid for praise god all you got to do is enjoy it amen that's wonderful and just just enjoy what someone else has given to you amen and he has given us every redemptive blessing amen praise the lord now you could stop anywhere here you know that you could stop anywhere and and enlarge that man but the time is just flying by us here and so praise god i just want to bring into something else now amen and just carry on because i i don't even think apophis could preach that today he could get some of it but he wouldn't get all of what i told you already this afternoon i want you to know amen you didn't even teach it what you know to be the truth praise the lord amen but when we come into uh read into our day amen and we see that brother brown i'm amen uh he's talking here and he says uh everything has happened just exactly he said i may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world for as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming so so this message for on the second coming amen and john said i behold the lamb of god you say that takes away the sins of the word say he says it's paralleled in every way now we know that you can take john he's the elijah the same as john the baptist was elijah john fulfilled what what luke 1 2 whatever the chapters are but angel said zacharias amy fulfilled it but he didn't fulfill turning the hearts off the of us back to the candy court the children back to the pentecostal father he john never fulfilled that that's it that's clear so so this election would have to do it amen and he did it hallelujah and it's paralleled in every way john 4 on the first coming he would for on the second coming it's parallel and every way amen and so praise the lord let me just get down yes as john was sent forth with a message the first coming he'd do the second coming and he said oh will this be the time behold the lamb of god you say this is what he said now i want you just to age into this thought here amen praise the lord and uh let me see notice he said the word came to the prophet and this dispensation of grace in the water right well i'll tell you what i was listening let's keep preaching i thought it was nice because he said the word comes to the prophet then the spirit comes to the word right i thought that was nice and that's exactly what happened in jordan's river praise god right say the word came to the prophet and then the spirit came to the word hallelujah and led him off into the wilderness amen never changes and it's going to be the same and so notice that this dispensation of grace which he was ushering in greece right from this moment amen was in the water and then brother brown says no he said i thought you would catch it uh-huh and the water the first revelation of the word was in the water now you see where the bride started oh yes and where it started now we certainly started back in the men to god but actually in physical manifestation this is what he's saying he's saying it started hallelujah the first revelation was in the water in 1933 without being killer park him down hallelujah and i think that's true i think as far as i understand that right so amen and it says you see where the bride started that's that's it this is it you're on your way right right is calm hallelujah and the word's coming to the prophet and the messages started and the pride is going to be on the scene and he said you see where the bride started you see the evening light message started in the water right that's what he says and it's the truth that's exactly that's john because he's parallel exactly and every way the word the true word not mixed up with creeds or denominations but come to the prophet in the water hallelujah nine amen and he says i hope he said well i'll just read this if i may he said i hope you'll try my ministry with this of letting me take the close of his word address his bride well thank god he's done it amen you know we were listening to brother ronald the other night and he preached our most outstanding message on thursday night outstanding message and we love him dearly he's a buddy he's a great friend of mine now i'll tell you what you know what he said what the devil told him right up there he said you flopped tonight oh man i'll tell you what buddy you know we've got an enemy and he'll heal tran reason he'll try and work out every way he can to make you doubt this word but praise god this word is thus saith the lord hallelujah amen praise god and so here he is he said ah that's what he would do and dress his bride in the close of the word and for his righteousness i hope he'll cry me and let me stand on that day and say behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world not right but i want to take you somewhere else here just in a moment praise the lord i'm just going to go very very quick and he says at the end time prophecies will repeat i believe as the first forerunner came in the wilderness and cried behold the lamb of god the second forerunner will do the same by pointing the people to the word born bright amen right then this is what he says this is where the difference is see because we can't go back to the river jordan amen i mean i can't take these all back there and baptize you know we're not going to meet him in the river anyway praise god so he's already been in the river jordan amen finished that see and uh i'll just mention what the priest said in a moment but here he is and he said uh the second forerunner will be pointing the people to the word born bride the bride of christ will be pointed to the skies oh yes hallelujah not to the river jordan just for us to go over there and no no to the skies hallelujah so something's going to happen in another dimension something's going to happen in another place i'm screaming behold the lamb of god right all right now praise the lord so that's it he will do this even as john the first forerunner the messenger uh so this messenger to the elect onward born bride now we know george ministry didn't do that but his ministry would and uh praise the lord uh the bride john pointed to the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world he still does he tells those of you believe it and this christ has done and has continued to do but to us bride who has experienced the atonement we now fasten our eyes on the lamb not in the water but in glory hallelujah and that's the wonderful thing nine praise god that when you are when you look at the first part you know are we always saying my soul is saved you know and you always talk about that soul salvation you see and we always talk about that as christians amen and uh praise the lord and that's what it was i've got so many scriptures here uh my the soul of my soul which that has redeemed you know the psalms the redemption of their soul is precious ephesians whom we have redemption through his blood have obtained eternal salvation amen not redeem with corruptible things but with the precious blood of christ as a lamb without spot without blemish amen and uh and and that was all right that's fine and we know that i know my soul is saved right today but you see that theo for me that if we die today for the deal we could step in hallelujah we're right there i mean and we're just saying he's got that body prepared for us amen now praise the lord but we're looking for more than that right praise god we're looking for more now and i'm just gonna just give it to you very quickly for we know that the whole creation growneth and traveled and pain until now right not only they but ourselves which are the first which have the first fruit right of the spirit right i mean if you said to me it's brother dear god the holy ghost i know riverdale's got the holy ghost all of you i can see you here i know you got the holy ghost friends amen and it says here even our sails are groaning and yet we've got the holy ghost yes you're saying you know that things no but we're waiting what are we waiting for yeah we're not waiting for jesus to come back and talk to brother brother and raise them up and go across america or in the river jordan or nothing no we are waiting for the adoption to what the redemption of our party is hallelujah that's what i want i want the body to sister hallelujah i don't want to say i'll do this me or i don't i just want to burn children nobody'll have to do any anything like that praise god and so you know briefly you come into the further work of the lamb of god and you know that that's what brother brother says in that and in he said you see it says one of the greatest chapters in the book of revelation chapter four he's the great creator and they fall down and said the word worthy oh lord for you have created all things but here you see this one on the throne amen praise god and i'll tell you what friends when you're reading this this is hard i want you to think yeah you know i i even one of one of my friends there he showed me the scriptures a little description but psalm 110 the lord said unto my lord said that i learned i'll make your enemies your footsteps all right come on bro when you're reading that brother brother says lord jesus christ that's what he says hallelujah amen and so here in chapter five it's the same just keep it amen even beyond our heart understanding and there's one set there amen and he had that scroll that book of redemption in his hand because it had went back to his eye amen and here he is and praise the lord amen the club was right well the right hand is power and authority amen all power is given unto me who said that praise god that was jesus christ hallelujah and here he is amen and uh bless the lord amen amen the book of redemption and it's in the open hand of god right man amen and that's the title deed to the forfeited herds of the earth lost by adam when he failed it's a legal document and it guarantees the dispossession of cry of sin amen and all wicked men from the earth and guarantees our redemption hallelujah and so as we read out there in romans 8 amen and here we are until the redemption of the purchased possession amen praise the lord seven seals book amen and i'm going to show you something here praise the lord and here it is amen uh writing on the both sides the completeness of legal provision for dispossession i love that do you know that satan there's not one of us here in this church today that satan could come up and say i have a right to put this on you yeah because he doesn't right he doesn't he's a liar right he's a buffer and he's a squatter right praise god so when you if he talks to you i don't talk too much just to tell him to get away resist him amen praise god he'll tell you anything bless god amen the sales as you all know you went through all this that's why i want to touch it just you know i finished work and seven is complete and another thing it signifies ownership amen and the cloth was right who was worthy to take this book amen and there's nobody it seems it's worth it and john wept you know when someone said well it couldn't have been happening standing there bubbling like a baby well i don't know where he was but he saw that hallelujah and when he saw it he wept hallelujah so as we heard samuel said he moved up to the nuts and bolts of it all amen all we know is what he wrote hallelujah and i believe it and he was my representative praise god do you know listen now i'm just going to listen i'm going to do with a message but i'm going to give it to you anyway here's a little present for you today you know i'll give it to samuel and peggy today this time anniversary amen praise the lord john was our representative you know now why did and and and suffer at the end how community later on why when there was he said someone's going to betray me and don't and uh here's peter the first pope and he speaks up says well i can't get near him i can't get over there not just john and he said you asked and jones called the disciple who jesus said right sister loved now why would the bible say that because he's our representative he was representing the bride and he got right close to the very look folks he got if you come up here you can put your hand in here and feel my heartbeat and john felt the heartbeat of jesus christ he felt it and he said lord i'm a type of your bride and you'll tell me your secrets who is it who's going to deny you right and he said the one that takes us you know the story amen i represent that right if you want to if you're interested in it why did you go read the book of uh why don't you read the book of revelation and take a trip with jordan and see all he saw right because he saw it for you right right hallelujah okay amen and so hit us no man were they and then the calls out for the kingsman redeemer who's going to be the king's man redeemer who can do it hallelujah praise the lord amen and thank god i just have no time thank god he came forth amen somebody says the liar has overcome the lion of judah the tribe of judah and when he looked around he saw that lying alarm standing there as it had been slain my brother brought him out of my nose he said that's nice not he's not looking at an animal anymore now he's looking at the lambs that have been slain amen praise god i would say what he's looking at is what what exactly what the what what thomas saw that's what i would say amen as thomas saw it thomas saw and standing there with the nail prints as they have been slain okay and uh amen so here's the kinsmen redeemer coming forth this is the one that god said the seat of the woman would come and produce the serpent's head hallelujahs just possess them amen hallelujah praise god imagine going down there and and the demon said to the devil he's here he's here and the lord said you've lost your huskies you don't even have the keys to your own eyes i've got them today right yeah amen it's so wonderful amen praise god amen and our kinsmen redeemer i'm not going with it because you've been through it many many times i'm sure about ruth and all the things that god amen and so here he was praise the lord he's so long amen and uh he triumphed amen he was alive again and he's in the midst of the throne bless the lord now and i just want to get on here and it says here and when john looked to see the land he saw a lamb all the way through the bible it couldn't be a lot he wasn't lying when he died he was the land of the tribe of judah it certainly was he come back as the land of the tribe of jesus certainly will but he was the lamb and of god going to change folks he was the lamb of god then before the foundation of the word he's the lamb of god right now in this story amen and john looks to see a lie and he sees this lamb amen my brother brother says it wasn't it was not an animal see he took the book amen and praise god that here he is and he's got seven horns amen and seven eyes now amen we're not just typing for the sake of typing prison when i sit here some people type and you know what i mean two flies run up the wall and type you don't do that amen praise god there's no type of that for us but you know something there's a type right here when i talk about seven eyes and i know that's the seven churches messengers that's who i know that is that you've talked about it in zechariah amen and the seven horns seven powers amen and praise god that's the seven churches so whatever john saw he saw the lamb and he saw the messengers on all the bride there he musta because it says that's what the seven are that's brother branham amen saying that so praise god i that's wonderful amen and what was in the vision i just want to show you something in a minute praise the lord but when you think about this and i'm just going to move on just the next five minutes trying to die now just think about this my mind here's adam adam couldn't even open the book he needed the king's man redeemer himself so he couldn't do it amen nobody could do it and now when he takes the book he's not stopped thou art worthy he takes the book amen and for the first time in six thousand years a man amen the albeit a glorified man he's got the book in his heart wonderful now and just in a brief way of saying it that means there's hope for the human race when he shed his precious blood every drop of it wrecked on the cross and into the ground it speaks to me and it says like evil's blood amen and it speaks that there's hope on this planet hallelujah because his precious blood has flowed on it amen and now for the sixth ten and third six thousand years he's got the broken side he's got the scrolls praise the lord amen now just i just want to go through this here because you're so beautiful amen amen and so amen um the lamb here he is the lamb he's got the book amen he's got the title d amen and uh they say they fell down the four and twenty elders and all the beasts and they all fell down before the lamb and they all had hearts as prison worship and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints god is very particular about his sins prayers he loves his sins to pray and he never forgets them he never forgets your prayer so don't forget to pray amen always pray always pray keep praying be a prayerful person every day of your life amen i so prince god can you just imagine here uh they're looking at this and they say thou art worthy to take the book amen amen and to open the seals thereof so brother branham said he didn't know what the sins were you know that praise god he said i didn't know what that person was until he told me what it was right amen and so praise god you have opened the sales for that was slain and has redeemed us to our god right amen now praise the lord you say for the bride i'm not interested in a and baptist theology i couldn't care less about the westminster confession of faith and all that and john calvin amen listen but what i am understand is the is the messenger hallelujah praise god that's what i'm interested in amen and so here he is now where do we go with this message seven seals and opening the book and where do we go with that message you see how do i know that this has really happened so far right you see that's how i know in case you can't read it from the back sister june it's called the revelation of the seventies so you might say oh brother that's the end of the age and brother brother said that yes and they're all overlapped sure but i'll tell you what i know these things are open right because they're right here i've got them in my head and i know that that prophet said brother gary this is not saith the lord hallelujah thus death the lord so we have got it and it's history hallelujah they're open they're revealed the book is open armies come down and he's revealing the invisible union praise god the invisible union of the bride of christ we're in union with them with united with the word hallelujah and we're mrs jesus christ and here he is under the crown out i wish i had the strength amen and that has redeemed us to god by thy blood right what you share in calvary amen hallelujah and that's why we sing every week about the blood shall never lose its power no never and he said if you walk in the light amen as he is in the light the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin it's a never effectual going on hallelujah that where we are today and that's how god sees us washed in the clorox blood of jesus christ amen amen hallelujah and you've redeemed us out of every kindred tongue and people and nation i was very surprised to hear brother tony under say there's no message church in greece of all the places and greece yes in greece amen so folks i tell you what don't get too comfortable in your pew but you've got a little bit longer to stay on it because i'll tell you what a lot of people haven't heard yet amen until the last seed comes in and it might be a greek and there's no church here in greek yet there's no message in greek

or whatever come and let's pray for you and then we'll go right on into the communion okay heard a great message he lovely is you would it's all up you're ready for you but to feel common first corinthians 11 23 forever received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take e this is my body which is broken for you this is due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he ends up saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoe the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily she will be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and shall let him eat of that blood and drink let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged now we'd love this scripture amen but when we are judged you know we're guilty we've done something yeah we're judged then we're chasing by the lord to keep them from having to be destroyed or we'll repent see all right so but when we are judged we're chasing to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world we're for my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hungry let him eat at home that you come out together in the condemnation and the rest will i sit in order when i come now let's just take a few moments and it's just anybody has anything to get out of the way before we take the communion then the all is always open and things and just so if there's any problems in something you say forgive me you know whatever if not all mine's clear then let's take a few moments to just have a silent prayer before we go on into the rest of the service we thank you for your loving grace and to us lord we thank you for all things and you said you give them unto us freely so we don't have to work for them we don't have to pay for them not do anything all we got to do is receive we thank you we love you and we ask you to just guide us now and open our understanding because in doing that then lord we can walk in the light of your love forgive our sins lead us all by thy grace in jesus name amen the bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread it was made for this purpose today and only for this purpose was it made yes we ask you that you would just sanctify the bread we know this is not the body but it is in yes we've seen people healed even taking communion because it isn't something about the remembrance and things that you told us to do you told us to do this until you come well some stop because they believe you're here but the next thing we do is have it at the marriage supper so what's the problem we're still taking it now lord we love you and we thank you and commit everything into your hands sanctify the food and the partakers in jesus name he said this is the broken body it wouldn't it wasn't a round wiper their brother was talking about it right around wafer then there's no need of it ever being around white right it wouldn't wouldn't that way but you see that's what people have been taught and you know they swear by it and they'll do everything they can to try to back it up and you know even die for it and it being wrong but yet thank god for the truth amen thank god for the truth that's that's the main thing you shall know the truth yes and the truth will set you that's free i told you about when was in the badges we used to order the bread from the publishing house we'd keep it every three months we just put it back in the freezer and pull it back out in three months and you know of course we believed in we wasn't catholics but what we believed was the same thing yeah father we thank you for this line this went through the process of aging it's now getting better each day because it's the top of our blood yes that was shed for each and every one of us and lord as we eat this natural little piece of bread and we drank this little sip of wine yes we know and for surety that tomorrow it will be blood cells in our body from a creation of a way that you made for these things to be lord but we know too that the opening of our word is what we desire the stimulation of revelation that the prophet spoke of that's what we desire come and quicken the word towards one of our hearts and lives forgive our sins and cleanse us from all run righteousness lead us in jesus name amen come morning and i'll walk by the river i'll carry my cross through the midnight a morning for me sometimes i'm despised then i take one come free i'll carry my cross through the midnight comedy you know every day that we get older you know we get one day closer to eternity it's not a problem then for if i was wishing for anything everybody wants to back up in time you know they'd like a little time machine to step in back up you know into some other age or something or even back up 20 years or back up 40 years or 50 years or something you know if i had my choice i'd want to advance you know why because if it was possible to advance i'd be closer to eternity you know i mean i want to go that way i don't want to get young i've enjoyed being a human being and had a wonderful time in life and god has given me you know gave me good health to bring me to the place i'm in and all and i really enjoyed it and i don't want to go backwards let's go forward just step on over into eternity and they'll all be overwhelmed because it'll be a wonderful day but i'm enjoying now amen amen you know i'm enjoying now the opening of god's word because i'm like you know that i'm getting my food now to be able to understand when i get there and i'm like little rebecca wood i'm just listening to isaac i mean to ella easier tell me all about isaac because she knew as i said the other day of so much about him until she didn't have to you know look around she just did that and like i said she didn't she was after riding a camel for three months she probably didn't smell too good she probably didn't look too good because she was you know she'd been doing that day in and day out but she wasn't concerned about that right what she was concerned about it was to see her husband she never had any thoughts whether she would be accepted or not you know never in no way did she have any conception that she wouldn't or any fear for anything that she was not going to be accepted right because they're easier done told her all is well our prophet has told us all as well i call you bride he says that's wonderful to be called a bride jesus called him friends he said i don't don't i don't call you servants and things anymore he said i call you friend right all right let's see the prophet said i call you bride because that's what we are that's it right amen amen let's all predict again you can be seated for a minute while we're getting through with the reading of the scriptures going into the foot washing you know john the 13th chapter and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas's carrot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to simon peter and peter said unto him lord does thou wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do i know it's not now but i shall know hereafter peter says unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i waste thee not that has no part with me simon peter says unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus saith unto him he that is worse neither is not saved to wash his feet but his clean ever with and you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what i have done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet you also want to wash one another's feet for i've given you an example that you should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you that servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do that if you know the correct way you know everything's right happy are ye to do if not it's just a directory to something you go through every once a month you know but if you really love the lord and know the truth it's a wonderful thing and let's stand together be dismissed where the sisters can go downstairs father we thank you for the day we thank you for the word that our brother has brought unto us we believe it and we believe we just thank you
