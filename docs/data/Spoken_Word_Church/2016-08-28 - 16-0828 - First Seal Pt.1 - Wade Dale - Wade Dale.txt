========================================

screen I think got it yeah I got I think you hit the screen screen just touch screen too yeah okay all right all right something's wrong hello helloo hello hello hello hello it's doing something what's up working right something it was PR it bad for the way I saw when you take it off when you took it off the thing yeah see testing try it now see I'm not saying anything showing that we're talking real loud right now maybe the F how about now yeah it's picking you up okay all right now Revelation 6 what we're doing is we're going to the seals we kind of background all the way through we talked about uh Revelations 5 we talked about Redemption last Sunday we brought in justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost um and we're not going to get off of that because that's what the seals are the Seals of the revelation of Christ personally to you in your new birth showing you that your justification does not come to an end like we saw Martin Luther's come to an end his justification I hope you understood that his justification come to an end all right his then Wesley's sanctification come to an end but it wasn't an end like an abrupt stop it was a an end that goes so far and then something else laps over and takes over right right stair steps you can't start from the top and build steps because you have to build one on top of the other right the first runner on the step ends but if you don't have that end of that first runner the second runner can't sit on top of it to make the second the board can't set on it to make another one sure it ends but what are you doing you're building on what Martin Luther had we're building on the justification Martin Luther had we're building on the sanctification John Wesley had nobody Through the Ages ever understood that I don't believe until now even up to the Pentecostal Pentecostal said you speak in tongues you got it so what are they doing about justification sanctification it just all went out that wouldn't have been so bad but brother R said they cabbaged down on that and said that's it yeah well it's not it it's just a it was a continuation brother BR said God moved on they stopped right so they stopped and then God moved on so God moved on to just cas San baptis holy ghost coming up through your new birth you're being being justified every time you ask forgiveness of your sins you're being justified yes right right Paul says I Die daily daily sanctification daily right right on up to the New Birth you say well you get the new birth one time right right but you get what many feelings that's right one you birth but many feelings so does it end no it just keeps going because we realized that see I don't think Martin Luther Martin Luther realized that there was something going on but he didn't I don't think he realized his position as well as we understand his position because we're looking back and brother brandham brought all the revelation of what he had and brought it up to date now I love what he said though brother Bram said now if John Wesley or Martin Luther was here tonight sitting in this building listening in other words to him him preach their Revelation would just explode because of what they built on cuz they had the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost can't deny the word so everything the Holy Ghost says through a prophet or through a preacher or through anybody if you've got the Holy Ghost it's going to build on it right so Martin Luther would be shouting as far as he saw his justification go on to today those who he justified now see he's already glorified right right to me that's what the seal show because look let's just let's just be practical once you first got once you first got saved you wasn't thinking about a glorified body but that's what the Bible says that once you get Justified you need to start looking at your glorified body and there what the Bible says those who is Justified he has Justified you can't justify yourself already those that he has Justified he's already GL glorified he he he he he has already glorified all right so that's the same thing we're going to walk when we walk through these seals I want you to see that your justification is ongoing your sanctification is ongoing yes even this even this Rider brother bandam said he he gets off of one horse and gets on another one he continues right on also but you know why it continues on let's go back to the mirror you know why Satan can incarnate a popee in the end timeus cuz you're God incarnate right in the end time and you're going to be so God incarnate right at the end till your flesh is going to be changed that's right right so Satan's going to see how that happens and he's just going to step right in and he's going to Incarnate a pope and it's going to be the devil incarnate in human flesh that's what he wants that's right all right so and I hate to say this but he does he Satan picks up the mind of God he picks up the things that God's doing and has a plan back in Ezekiel when we saw he thou were perfect what eel 40 somewhere thou were perfect when you were first created You Walked In the Garden of Eden right right so Satan is not way out you under somewhere you know he's he's so close till he can deceive he could deceive the very elect if it were possible but it's not possible so now and we've been talking about the mirror so we we let me review that for some of you good to see Susan back good to see Sister Barbara back good to see Timbo good to see brother Louis and Sister Christine back they've been they've been riding a chariot all over the United States and not been I see so um good to have them all back yeah but we've been talking about the mirror because Timbo see yourself in that is that you no it's not that's not you that's an image of you that's right that only does what you do so that's an image now what we're talking about though you say well now God says we remain in His image well don't you think I know that Genesis 26 but God is able to create an image create a person in His image Satan cannot create so he can't create a person in the image of Satan he has to copy everything that God remember brother Brown said Satan knew the principles of life he knew how to get to Eve when God put them in human flesh he knew they were going to fall because he knew that Satan would jump right into that flesh part of Eve the emotions and all those things like that right okay but you say well we were made in His image that's correct we were made Satan can't make you do anything that's right except what you want to do amen right that's right just like Revelation 61 you got a man with a bow no arrows you got a man that was given Power by a group of people people right and we were talking about the Revelation that even though this is revealed you know brother Randon preached this 1963 the seals were open I believe he opened those seals the lamb opened those seals to brother brandham put light on things that had never Shone before didn't bring a new Bible he just took the same Bible that he had and God revealed things just like Martin Luther I believe when Martin Luther really saw that just shall live by faith and got a revelation from God it became a brand new book to Martin Luther he saw things different just like you talking about the the 31 party the lady with the Trinity they see the Trinity even if you take Scofield which was a wonderful writer he had some you know we think that brother brand came up with theophanies and logos and all in 1906 or 1916 really that version of the Bible was put out in 196 by Dr Scofield he talks about the logos he talks about theophany see so those are not new words but they're looking but you see in here many times that that um Scofield says the Trinity is laced throughout the Bible well see that's all they see they see the three persons of the godhead all the way through the body now that is false but yet that's what they see the Bible had become a brand new book to them right right in that degree and the Bible's not become a brand new book to me and you until it's until it starts being revealed that's right okay that's right I mean when you're a sinner you didn't care that's right really right did you read your Bible when you were a sinner I didn't think so you might have had one that your mama gave you or your daddy gave you or grandma gave you but where was it you know you had to go find it but now do you have to go find your Bible now oh it should be just common so see the Bible's become a brand new book everybody makes that to brother brandham which is true it may a brand new book to him but it shouldn't be a brand new book every time God reveals something to you the Bible should be a brand new book when you really see predestination that it's not just set and dried mhm that you do have something to do with it then you see the you see the book a lot different that's right you don't see a trinity anymore in there do you no you did before what's the difference the Revelation you were brought up into you were caught up John was caught up in Revelations 4:1 to see things all right same thing with you and I that's why I said U last Sunday and I I don't want you to get it wrong I'm I'm ready for the Rapture I'm in Rapture condition right now I didn't say body chain I said right if God comes tomorrow if I'm not ready I'll have to die but I'm coming up first resurrection so what's so what's the problem right if I've got the Holy Ghost if I've got the Holy Ghost if you've got the Holy Ghost you're already raptured you're already caught up sitting in Heavenly places you say well you this that's your problem I don't have a problem I know I'm born again I know I'm going in resurrect I'm going to go on a Rapture so I am in rapturing condition now we but a lot of times if you're not you better see that's a level you got to come to you got to come to a level that everything's settled right right it's like who was y y were talking about a house you know can you come in my house anytime sure enter my house I ain't got to hide something I ain't got to kick something in the closet it may not be the cleanest place in the world but you know what so what you got it all right ain't nothing to do with it all right that's right keep this house clean this is the house you got to clean up you know if if Jesus walk through your front door would you have to go hide stuff yeah a lot of you have to go put television up a lot of you have to go put your um computers up and surely wouldn't let him in the hard drive let me give you a secret he don't need any of that he already knows but if you're born again today you're in R condition I want everybody that's what I told y'all even before brother Dell said it we got to start confessing exactly y'all see last Sunday the Lord's really he's moving on this church for some reason that's right showing us say who you are already it's your confession well I'm not ready for the Rapture well you're not born again am I right CU you want to spend all day in the scripture those who is Justified is already glorified there's therefore now no condemnation I love Romans 8 Romans 8 1 through the end of the chapter is just to me it shows a Christian Paul gives you the he gives you the grace of extending the grace of that you're already number one Romans 8:1 those that there's there therefore now no condemnation to them there which in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you go down and you say if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you that's right he will also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that dwells in you so if you got if you got spirit of God inside of you you already got a body change cuz everybody's going to get a body change this born again that's right to me this is what the seals has revealed to me instead of being so narrow-minded like brother BR said one time he said people are so narrow-minded if you put a pencil between her eyes it touch both it touch both eyeballs that's why we you know that's why we're so narrow-minded that we don't let God deal that's right with us right we've sat here for years even us that have the the new birth that are that are I don't know if I'm ready for the Rapture or not baloney if I may say baloney M turkey yeah whatever you want to say really you're in rapturing condition right now if you're born again you're going in the Rapture if you're born again amen yeah let me give you a drastic case the brother the preacher that brother randam knew what was his name the one that bought the bear Ramsey wasn't it Ramsey Ramsey born again Christian let his flesh and his Spirit take him over right went out and got him some beer was going to start drinking brother Brown said 6 months later he was dead why God took him home to not Mar well he was a born again Christian yes and you know what regardless of the person that saw him the last six months of his life said man he must be lost he's drunk he's a preacher he's supposed to do this his confession is wrong he'll be up in the resurrection right he'll get a body changed for you will amen mhm see how narrow minded we get M now we can't fall over into greasy Grace but we can bring it to the we can bring it to the revelation of these seals that shows us true justification right true sanctification true baptism of the Holy Ghost right cuz as we see here we we we John is watching a scene all right and he's watching and then then brother brand picks this up and in all this in this love letter now it doesn't say one thing about a lamb does it anywhere except right there the lamb opened one of the seals now in in the world of of the way we used to think then that's Jesus over there I got that where's the lamb today brother B said the lamb the Holy Ghost same person if you got the Holy Ghost then the lamb is not a over here because listen if the Lamb's over here that white horse rider is right here what you got to do is this right no that's what our problem is and you see in and and I I I'm sorry but in denominational World they have Jesus Jesus over here Jesus doing this Jesus back here in history Jesus that's okay that's a foundation mhm but what about in here that's right that's right right right saw one church yesterday had a had a big sign says this is Holy Ground well no it's not they they had it on the church said this is Holy Ground Church is not Holy Ground that's right the people that go into the church should be the Holy Ground right it's just a building this building is not going in Raptor right right these people are going in rap people are going in Raptor not building all right so let's realize one thing if the lamb brother Brown said the lamb stands here with a book in his hand and there goes the white horse rider we got to look at a separation but now what we're talking about Timbo is the mirror image that's the real person but that's an image inside there That's what Satan is Satan is an image he is not a real person he's not flesh you understand what I'm saying he's not a human he never has been human never will be a human right he's an angel right right right right he can't create so he has no seed to reproduce himself MH he has no way way of overpowering God no way no way of overpowering God I heard something good the other day I'm going to share it with you why don't we quit spending so much time telling God about our problems and spend more time telling our problems about our God yes think about that we go to God say God I got this problem I got this problem why don't you just start telling you problems about the God that's already fixed the problem amen he died on the cross to fix every problem you have anything that's coming up doesn't matter he took every bit of that of Calvin yeah that's why he was a lamb he's a lamb slain before the foundation of the world but he had to be slain down here so you're going to see when we start in these seals it's not going to be some great mystery that you think but it is one of the greatest Mysteries that ever hit the face of this Earth how that God can dwell in flesh I was um um looking at some YouTube videos on uh I never watched the passion uh Passion of Christ and and I may watch it but anyway there was some clips of a song that was being sung and it showed parts of the passion and and I looked at that you said well that's an actor but really Jesus was a human man right features no he he he he bled he he had he had problems and 30 years old you know he may have had more problems than we do because man look at the load that he have the world says you you're not over 50 years old well it wasn't even 30 hardly you understand what I'm saying so we sometimes we separate the humanity but let's put it back together because as he's human if God dwelt in him reconciling the world to himself right right then as he became human he became human that we could become God Amen right he became human that we could become God so we see in these seals that we have to see a separation there's always going to be a mirror image there's always going to be because watch you got a white one you got a red one you got a black one and a pale one you've got these riders that are riding but they're not riding out past God everybody get that yes right all right so we're going to start on the first seal a little bit today but we'll get started on it next Sunday so God is riding forth with a true white righteous church that first three Church ages we talked about this before but the first three Church ages zero denomination sure there was little ideas and little sayings remember brother BR talks about sayings Deeds Doctrine and then it become incarnate but God is writing first don't ever forget that you say well brother R never said that does he have to does he have to preach all this and somebody go well boy Satan he's he's doing a lot and God I don't see God in there anywhere God's first anything that Satan does is just a carbon copy and remember the carbon coffee in the garden only changed the text by one word right yeah God said Thou shalt surely die Satan just put not in that very same phrase that was the mirror image but that wasn't see what he does see perverted it from the original that's right to his to this image he added one little thing but the same thing with these seals he he has added something that's the problem with people they think the Seven Seals or polygamy and they they name all these things off no it's Redemption to its highest form yes period amen a mystery of iniquity I told y'all last Sunday you are a product of iniquity born in sin shapen in what iniquity right and we commit iniquity every single day you said well then that don't make you Rapture they got to do with it that's right that's this thing this thing fails every day amen that's right so I don't look at this failure right you know what I look at I look at what he's already done he opened the seal first Satan didn't open up nothing that's right the lamb opened it and what it done it produced twins what it produce in the garden twins what it produce when Jesus came twins whates it produce now twins same thing always going to produce twins and you know what to look at Cain and Abel like brother R said you look at Cain and Abel from the outside you would think Cain did more works for God than able Cain spent a whole year planting crops fertilizing growing the crops making it beautiful and taking it to the Altar and as many people have Illustrated and there's Abel laying up there under a tree not sweating he's he's just Fanning himself and letting the Sheep grow and let the Sheep do their thing and Abel's down there he's probably I mean Kane's probably sweating like crazy and you which one would you pick which one you pick Hey listen Judas was so much so close to Jesus to when Jesus told him who he was told him the one that stops in the bowl is the one that's going to deny me and then Jesus said go do what you're going to do like what brother Brown said he said he thought well he's just going to go pay for them they had no idea that Judas was the the traitor right no idea right that's how close how close it is now but this produced twins right okay the lamb and the Riders the horse riders right got it that's right but they ride so close now watch the only way you're going to see though see now we we know we're a product of iniquity and we know that we commit iniquity every day you say what what is that that's knowing to do better and don't do it or you do something knowing you shouldn't have done it and you did it anyway and I also heard something else the other day and it was a great commentary that Grace God is the only person that could ever create Grace right you and I couldn't do it there's no human way that we can have the grace that God had only God could produce something called Grace good right that's amen amen and you better repete it for everything you do amen amen amen all right but see what do we do though when we were a sinner and we committed sin we just let it run on and what did it do it just heaped up on us right but now as we commit a sin Christians sin every day am quickly we say God I didn't mean to do that forgive me and you ain't got to get out on your KNE see that's what Martin Luther would do let's switch back over to Martin Luther Martin Luther once he did that he would get down on the floor drag yourself across he smack himself with you know lashes and and you know uh not eat for 3 or 4 days what trying to do penants trying to make this thing right obey okay but once he got born again he stood up one day I believe and he said hey the just shall live by faith and not by this okay that's right not by this Penance that I do and see that's what turned the world around was people started seeing that and started believing it well same thing with now let's go to the seals the seals have been written in the Bible for500 years written you in letter form right Bible's been here for Bible wasn't here back when uh John wrote this John was writing the Bible right right okay so man has had nothing to study and even when they studied it they were getting things wrong that's right right they were getting things wrong even though they open it and great Scholars they read it and even maybe overjoy reading it the first time right cuz remember the Roman Catholic is is the one the Latin vgate is is where they brought all this together right so the Catholic really had the first um the first writings or the first the first time it was ever put together the Roman Catholic Church was the first on to open it up and read it well boy look what that happened look what happened with that okay but you see now though that God has brought that same book where was the seals where is the seals at it's in the Bible the seals are sealed up in the Bible in a book remember we read in Revelations 5 on the front side and the back seal with Seven Seals All right but now I'm going to ask you one more time and then we're going to read brother R preached this in 1963 this was the opening of the seals right why we still here the spiritual aspect of hasn't been revealed there must be a love letter in here that we haven't read yet there must be a supernal element in these writings cuz see you know what the devil the devil knows that so so so the brothers read it and they go polygamy the brothers read it and they go seven th verses the brothers read it because they have their own Revelation they've never had this happen they never had the lamb stand here and the white horse rider go off because remember even in page on page 109 of the first seal brother R said I made a horrible mistake why he was going to preach the rather with the Holy Ghost okay so that's what he preached before but God corrected him on that what was the correction he could come to the first seal then and say here stands a lamb and there goes something that used to be inside of me not as a not as a not as in his soul not in his soul he's born again he can't touch that soul but it was in his Spirit form Satan had come in and gave him a different slant you say oh who else God cannot contradict his word amen so anything even an idea we have that's off the word of God come from one of them two twins that's right and it don't come from the original one right it can't come from this one he can't come from the lamb he's pure he's the only one that was worthy right that's right so the lamb was the only one that was worthy to what to open the book that's right no Prophet priest king no nobody but the lamb all right Satan can't open it now remember if you'll look we will continue in here brother brandham said he said what' he say he said if I keep it in my heart I think it was on the seventh se he said if I keep it in my heart Satan can't get to it he said but once I speak it see once I speak it Satan can pervert it he said but if I keep it in my heart well see he kept it in his heart but when he revealed these seals he was breaking something forth so that you can say I have hid these things in mind my heart and there goes a spirit riding off he that sat on him had a bow riding away all right now let's read it then everybody time we kind of got when never you never never ever forget Redemption ever don't ever forget Redemption Redemption is in everything predestination every major Doctrine one God water baptism it all has to do with Redemption cuz we were lost yes okay and Redemption does what redeems you back to the position that you rightfully should have had had there not been a fall being a way for it's a religious spirit right that's correct cuz you know there listen and and I don't want to be contrary don't have a quote for this but there was a white righteous Church in the first three churches that's true because if there wasn't you got to watch every time we read this remember there's an original right and there's a copy twins there's an original and a copy this White Horse could not have rode out with somebody on it had there not been a white horse already rode out in the Christian because this is all opposition who opposes and exalted himself we read it last Sunday above all he's trying to be that white righteous Church there was a white righteous Church they didn't have false Doctrine sure it had started starting to creep in but the majority look at your church age chart a lot of white in that first age then it got a little bit more and less but what was white it was the white righteous people right but what happened was they started coming in and we'll get to it next Sunday but let's read these scriptures before we go and then we'll set up bases for the first seal next Sunday and I saw when the lamp open one of the seals and I heard as were the noise of thunder so there was something something what does thunder do gets your attention right it got Paul's attention or Saul it got Saul's attention on the road to Damascus right obviously Jesus was speaking and it thundered he got some attention all right there was a thunder went off out there on Sunset mountain right okay noise noise noise of thunder so what was the Thunder one of the four Beast is come and see when thunder goes off first thing you do is you kind of look around trying to figure out where it come from right but Saul was struck down by lightning and then there was Thunder but now remember brother Brown said the Thunder is the voice of God and the seal break so now what broke to Paul not a seal that broke to Paul but it was a seal that broke the B Saul why do you persecute me right they were together now not to see then you say well you got two Souls no you don't have two Souls see you you see how they get all that see how they get that they say well here stands the lamb and there goes the W they must have both been in there we'll explain that later but Saul was not a white righteous man when God struck him down he was killing Christians almost blasphemed himself I think you realize that had the people kill because of Christianity now that's not a white righteous man okay that's that's this man Saul wasn't doing the killing it was Satan through Saul was doing the killing right but when it thundered God spoke to Saul and there was a separation begun same thing with me and you when God called your name at church or behind a bush or behind a tree or listening to brother brandham there was a thunder and you know what somebody satting beside you didn't hear it wasn't their time you heard it what was it a voice of God speaking to you that's right that's right right it had if you have not had had that experience you say well I've never heard an audible voice well I have but if you Haden heard an audible voice but if something one night changed you and turned you and sent you in a direction that you didn't want to go really but then it became easier and easier then you know that God is drawing you somewhere okay right okay cu the the the literal voice of God is good but but I'd rather hear him speaking out of the word because see because you can hear a voice in your head like Daddy's always said you know you think well God Speak so soft and Satan so no Satan is a deceiver what did Jesus say to Saul Saul why are you persecuting me right I don't believe he said it real soft so all why are you persecuting me right who are you Lord I'm Jesus well that blew his mind that blew his mind I mean really it did it blew his natural mind and what it done though was what did it do it got saw to thinking in his natural brain cuz he never saw Jesus before so what in his natural brain he was going Jesus must be in them people that I'm [Music] persecuting and then that remember Saul's a scholar Saul knew the Old Testament and you know what happened it's just like D's always said and I say I say I say I say you have got to hear the word before you can get born again that's right you have got to hear the word of God you got to have something to to face your salvation on right Saul knew that Old Testament scroll like the back of his hand right and when God came to him I believe scripture just started opening up remember he had his eyes were his eyes were blinded and he had where' he have to go he didn't go down to the Pharisees he didn't go to the Sanhedrin no go God spoke to anas a born again Christian that's right that's right and said you go see Saul and he's like wait a minute Lord this man's killed some of my brothers and my sisters you sure you want me to go down there and lay hands on him but you know what the life comes through the body of Christ the only way and I don't believe listen I don't believe ananas just walked in laid his hands on Paul his eyes open and he walked out I believe he testified to him okay I believe he told him what Jesus Christ meant to him yes you said what it's not in the Bible somebody just didn't walk in lay hands on you and you just automatically received everything did you right there was a testimony there was a testifying how God done something for you right right right if not then maybe you're not in rapturing condition and saw and behold a White Horse He that sing him had a bow so he had something to work with and a crown was given right you'll see them down through here power was given Satan has to be given power or permitted power all right and he went forth conquering and to conquer because remember the white righteous Church didn't kill Satan the real the real church right right didn't have enough strength right read your read your you have a little strength it's in Revelations 3 2 and 3 you have a little strength see they had just enough to get three the ages okay that's right just like brother just like the 10 virgins we only got just enough oil we can't give you any you got to go get it somewhere else okay but now I want you I'm going read this one scripture in Matthew for many shall come in my name and say I am Christ and shall deceive many right and I want you to read we got we got to go read 1 Timothy [Music] 4:1 and we'll get into the symbols and all the things about the Seal Seal next Sunday
