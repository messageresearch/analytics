[7:36] back there doing that preach appreciate
[7:38] them for
[7:39] helping out tonight while we're
[7:40] short-handed
[7:43] yes
[7:45] um so a little bit a little bit of a
[7:46] lengthy reading tonight um
[7:49] but uh we'll read to about the 20th
[7:52] verse and it says
[7:53] um and it came to pass in those days
[7:57] that they went out a decree from caesar
[7:59] augustus
[8:00] that all the world should be taxed
[8:03] and this taxing was first made when
[8:05] cyrenius was governor of syria
[8:09] and all went to be taxed everyone into
[8:11] his own city
[8:13] and joseph also went up from galilee out
[8:16] of the city of nazareth into judea unto
[8:18] the city of david which is called
[8:19] bethlehem
[8:21] because he was of the house and lineage
[8:23] of david
[8:24] to be taxed with mary his espoused wife
[8:27] being great with child
[8:30] and so it was that while they were there
[8:32] the days were accomplished that she
[8:33] should be delivered
[8:35] and she brought forth her firstborn son
[8:37] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[8:40] laid him in a manger because there was
[8:41] no room for them in the end
[8:44] and they were in the same country
[8:45] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[8:47] watch over their flock by night
[8:50] and lo the angel of the lord came upon
[8:52] them and the glory of the lord shone
[8:53] round about them and they were sore
[8:55] afraid
[8:57] and the angel said unto them fear not
[8:59] for behold i bring you good tidings of
[9:01] great joy which shall be to all people
[9:05] for unto you is born this day in the
[9:07] city of david a savior
[9:09] which is christ the lord
[9:11] and this shall be a sign unto you
[9:13] ye shall find the babe wrapped in
[9:15] swaddling clothes lying in a manger
[9:18] and suddenly there was with the angel a
[9:20] multitude of the heavenly hosts praising
[9:22] god and saying glory to god in the
[9:24] highest and on earth peace good will
[9:26] toward men
[9:28] and it came to pass as the angels were
[9:30] gone away from them into heaven
[9:32] the shepherds said one to another
[9:35] let us now go even unto bethlehem and
[9:38] see this thing which has come to pass
[9:41] which the lord hath made known unto us
[9:44] and they came with haste
[9:46] and found mary
[9:47] and joseph and the babe lying in a
[9:50] manger
[9:51] and when they had seen it
[9:53] they made known abroad the saying which
[9:55] was told them concerning this child
[9:58] and all they that heard it wondered at
[10:00] those things which were told them by the
[10:02] shepherds
[10:03] but mary kept all these things and
[10:05] pondered them in her heart and the
[10:07] shepherds returned glorifying and
[10:09] praising god for all the things that
[10:11] they had heard and seen
[10:13] as it was told unto them you may be
[10:15] seated the lord had his blessing to the
[10:16] reading of the word
[10:21] now
[10:23] you there's a lot of things packed into
[10:25] that that scripture that we just read
[10:27] and let's just kind of take our time
[10:29] tonight as we navigate this and kind of
[10:31] think about it imagine in your head all
[10:33] the circumstances that took place and
[10:36] and uh we sure appreciated that skit
[10:39] on sunday i i was
[10:41] you know kind of sharing uh you know
[10:43] it's interesting how many how many
[10:44] things are brought out with a little
[10:46] skit and just uh
[10:48] just uh
[10:49] makes you makes you think about the
[10:51] circumstances that happened and and um
[10:54] you know you also begin to think too
[10:56] about how there's so many different
[10:57] gifts that are set in the church i i
[10:59] certainly couldn't if i tried to put
[11:00] together a skit like that i certainly
[11:02] couldn't do you know put together all
[11:04] the pieces with all the clothes and
[11:05] everything so it's certainly
[11:08] amazing to see everything come together
[11:09] in a way like that
[11:11] but you know you start thinking about
[11:13] all the things that went into the
[11:15] into this event that that happened and
[11:18] all the the scriptures that were
[11:19] fulfilled and all of the things that
[11:21] were happening as part of this began to
[11:22] unfold
[11:24] like for example they they came to
[11:26] bethlehem and brother adam explained how
[11:28] that bethlehem is the house of god's
[11:30] bread it's where jesus had to be born in
[11:32] bethlehem and that's where every
[11:33] believer is born because we're born from
[11:36] the word
[11:37] he was born in bethlehem because that's
[11:39] that's that's that's where that's that's
[11:41] where the word that comes from and type
[11:43] the the word is coming the house of
[11:44] god's bread were actually born from the
[11:46] word and so he had to go he had to
[11:48] return all of these things it looked
[11:49] like a a a a kind of a a rough spot that
[11:53] they were in where they they had they
[11:55] had to go navigating back to bethlehem
[11:57] when she was mary was pregnant and all
[11:59] the things that began to unfold and then
[12:01] then jesus was born there and and she
[12:03] went mary went into labor and all that
[12:05] circumstance of not being able to find a
[12:07] place to to to stay
[12:10] no room in the end and so forth and look
[12:13] and and she gave birth to the little
[12:15] jesus they're laying in a manger
[12:16] emmanuel laying in a manger
[12:18] and then you would think that you know
[12:20] the angels maybe kind of imagined in
[12:22] your mind the angels will we we got to
[12:25] tell somebody about this somebody's got
[12:27] to know here they are in this little
[12:29] spot in a in the end that nobody knows
[12:31] about nobody knew about the birth of
[12:33] jesus somebody's got to know about this
[12:36] and brother branham explained and why it
[12:38] had to be shepherds he explained that
[12:40] that that you they they bypassed they
[12:42] bypassed all the great cathedrals and
[12:45] all the people that had all the
[12:47] pharisees and caiaphas in his in his
[12:49] great big
[12:51] house where he was sleeping or wherever
[12:53] all that was bypassed to go to little
[12:56] shepherds
[12:57] what a strange thing to think that that
[13:00] the angels would bypass all of the
[13:02] people that were taught with all the
[13:03] religious they had all the training and
[13:05] all the background of what where they of
[13:08] of who the messiah would be they thought
[13:10] and where he would come but it was
[13:12] bypassed to go to little shepherds and
[13:15] brotherhood said why was this great
[13:17] event revealed to shepherds that would
[13:19] be kind of an astounding thing for us
[13:22] you think tonight what a great gift
[13:24] we've got in the message of the hour
[13:26] because there's a lot of people in the
[13:28] world that would that ponder over
[13:30] questions like this but we've got the
[13:32] answer we've got the answer to questions
[13:35] that the religious world can't even
[13:36] begin to grope at we've got the answer
[13:39] because god has spoken to us in this
[13:41] last days and that's why i believe that
[13:43] when you when you begin to dig into the
[13:45] message it quick and quickly elevates
[13:48] your understanding far beyond just like
[13:52] far beyond anything that the religious
[13:54] world can can probe at just like when
[13:56] these angels visited these little
[13:58] shepherds it elevated their
[14:00] understanding get elevated them to a
[14:02] place where they recognize that god had
[14:04] been manifested in flesh in their day
[14:07] and the angels told him how to find him
[14:09] and where to go to find him a shepherd
[14:13] a shepherd a little stinky shepherd a
[14:16] stinky shepherd that everybody would
[14:17] overlook nobody would nobody would
[14:19] nobody would think a shepherd that
[14:21] didn't have any experience speaking a
[14:23] shepherd how would you get some
[14:26] say shepherd we want you to give you
[14:28] give a message
[14:29] why would you expect a shepherd a little
[14:31] stinky shepherd to get up behind the
[14:32] pulpit and deliver a sermon that don't
[14:34] know how to speak or how to talk or how
[14:36] to do anything but a shepherd was the
[14:38] one that the angels came and gave this
[14:41] message to
[14:42] now what is a shepherd a shepherd is
[14:44] somebody that tends to sheep that
[14:46] watches over a sheep and so they
[14:48] understand what the sheep need and they
[14:50] know about them and they know they can
[14:52] they can tell the difference between a
[14:54] sheep and a goat and they can tell the
[14:56] difference between their sheep and
[14:57] somebody else's and the shepherds a
[15:00] shepherd's job is to guide or direct
[15:02] those sheep that don't know what they're
[15:04] they they need somebody to guide them
[15:06] and the shepherd's job
[15:08] job is to guide or direct in a
[15:10] particular direction so a shepherd
[15:12] somebody who watches over or looks after
[15:15] a guise that you begin to begin to
[15:18] ponder in your mind tonight why did it
[15:20] have to be shepherds why did god come
[15:22] down and give shepherds
[15:25] shepherds a message shepherd's a message
[15:27] to take and deliver to people all around
[15:30] that that this man the one that they had
[15:32] been looking for now
[15:33] now he was on earth
[15:35] a shepherd is somebody that's got to
[15:37] move sheep from one place to another
[15:40] move sheep from move sheep from from a
[15:42] place where we'll say it like this where
[15:44] they ain't saved to a place where
[15:46] they're born again a place from they're
[15:47] born again up to virtue and knowledge
[15:50] moving and moving and moving them a ship
[15:52] because a shepherd we'll put it we'll
[15:54] put it now a new testament shepherd
[15:56] somebody that's going to preach the word
[15:58] somebody that's going to preach so that
[15:59] it moves you in the right direction a
[16:02] shepherd somebody that can get out of
[16:03] the way so that god can begin to speak
[16:05] to you so that god can quicken something
[16:08] in your life and change you where you
[16:09] begin to you begin to bear war and you
[16:12] know you ain't even thinking about it
[16:13] you're not even trying to do it you're
[16:15] just doing what god wants you to do
[16:17] that's what a real shepherd is
[16:19] why was it revealed to shepherds brother
[16:21] i'm saying not to the theologians of
[16:23] that day
[16:24] he said they were the ones that the
[16:26] world that the theologians of the day
[16:28] were trained to hear it but they were
[16:30] bypassed
[16:32] he said jesus the son of david is born
[16:34] in bethlehem right under the shadows of
[16:37] the great cathedrals then if those
[16:39] people are trained and had been looking
[16:41] for the messiah for all these years four
[16:44] thousand years the messiah had been
[16:46] prophesied to come and then if the
[16:48] messiah be born in the shadow of the
[16:49] cathedral why do they have to go plumb
[16:52] back up into the mountains to a bunch of
[16:54] unlearned untrained shepherds to bring
[16:57] the great message the first message you
[17:00] think about how blessed we are to have
[17:02] heard a message that god bypassed all
[17:05] the great uh
[17:06] all the great cathedrals and all the
[17:08] denominations of the world it came down
[17:11] to a bunch of rotten stinking people
[17:13] that didn't deserve nothing and god
[17:15] forth something into your heart when you
[17:18] you were just you were just like a
[17:19] little stinking shepherd out there in
[17:21] the field that didn't know nothing about
[17:23] god or nothing about religion but god
[17:26] came down and spoke something into your
[17:28] heart that's why mr shepherds
[17:31] because shepherds would receive it
[17:33] shepherds the shepherds in their
[17:35] humility and their loneliness were the
[17:38] ones that would receive it they would
[17:39] say god i believe your word
[17:43] he said why do the angels go to
[17:45] shepherds to bring the message and he
[17:46] said to bring the great message the
[17:49] first message and he said and commission
[17:52] shippers
[17:53] you think about that those shepherds
[17:54] were commissioned
[17:56] they had a commission from god he said
[17:58] not the wise and untrained
[18:00] but shepherd
[18:01] is strange isn't it
[18:04] the messiah was right in the midst of
[18:06] the religious world
[18:08] the messiah was right in the middle of
[18:10] the religious world and the world failed
[18:12] to recognize it
[18:15] he said why didn't they go out on the
[18:16] hills of judea to unlearned untrained
[18:19] uncultured poorest of all
[18:21] look like the most unfit person
[18:24] for such a task
[18:26] to reveal the message and send them out
[18:28] to bring the message to take a bunch a
[18:31] group of people that were unfit they
[18:32] could not speak they could not preach
[18:35] and send them out to commission them and
[18:37] send them out to
[18:38] to tell the world that that christ was
[18:40] on the scene and he he brought he
[18:43] he brought to our attention that history
[18:45] repeats itself you say you you say well
[18:47] i but if i live back in that day then i
[18:50] would act different no you're you would
[18:52] you would if you're not interested in
[18:53] the word you would not be interested in
[18:55] the word then if you're interested in
[18:56] the word now you would be interested in
[18:59] the word then if there's something
[19:00] hungry in you now for the word there
[19:02] would be something back there hungry and
[19:04] i know i know there's got to be
[19:06] something real that would be your cry
[19:08] back then you see that
[19:10] and history repeats itself today the
[19:13] world is looking for christ manifested
[19:16] in the flesh
[19:17] and they're failing to recognize that
[19:19] despite the fact that god had called
[19:21] little meek lowly shepherds to proclaim
[19:24] that christ is here
[19:26] he said he knew they wouldn't receive
[19:28] such a message the way it come it wasn't
[19:30] in the taste of their learning it was
[19:32] different it wasn't what they had been
[19:34] trained to believe he would be like it
[19:36] was contrary to their theological
[19:38] understanding he knew that they wouldn't
[19:41] receive a message oh you you realize if
[19:43] you can just get away of all of your all
[19:46] of your
[19:47] we we think we're so great sometimes and
[19:49] we we we've got all this baggage of the
[19:52] thing the wrong things that we've been
[19:53] taught but if we can come in loneliness
[19:56] and humility like those shepherds did
[19:58] and just received the message of the
[20:00] angel
[20:00] [Music]
[20:01] he said the messiah was here
[20:04] so the messiah was here and there must
[20:06] be somebody recognize it
[20:09] there's got to be somebody recognizing
[20:13] what was the shepherd what was the
[20:14] shepherd's message
[20:16] the shepherd's message was messiah's
[20:18] here where was he he was now there in
[20:22] flesh
[20:23] and where is he today
[20:25] where is the messiah today
[20:27] he's now here in flesh
[20:30] that's why you know we were preaching on
[20:32] the rapture a few a few nights ago and
[20:34] you there's first got to come a shout
[20:37] but then there's got to come a voice
[20:39] what does the voice declare the voice
[20:41] declares that he's here
[20:42] for the angels the angel declared to the
[20:44] shepherds that i'll tell you where he is
[20:46] and they had to go see it and they had
[20:48] to go find it out but when they saw it
[20:50] then they could declare he's here the
[20:52] one that we've been looking for and
[20:54] they've been going to go down the
[20:55] streets and tell everybody he's here as
[20:58] the majority awaken making their way
[21:00] over to for two years that two getting a
[21:02] mage our covenant and the shepherds were
[21:04] going around telling everybody i know
[21:06] where you can find this messiah now
[21:08] brother brown said the shepherd was the
[21:10] most illiterate of anybody he didn't
[21:12] need to know nothing but just about his
[21:14] sheep
[21:16] he didn't need to know mathematics
[21:19] he didn't need to know how to split an
[21:21] atom
[21:21] he didn't need no scholarship you think
[21:23] about all the things that moses knew and
[21:25] then he had to unlearn because listen if
[21:28] you're going to be a shepherd it's not
[21:30] about how much you know by the
[21:32] intellectual world but how much you know
[21:33] about life
[21:35] how much you know about god how much you
[21:38] know about the one that can make put
[21:40] life into a little greater blast that we
[21:42] grasp that we walk on
[21:44] it doesn't matter how much you know
[21:46] about how whether you can how to split
[21:48] an atom or molecules and all how to put
[21:50] a spaceship in the space if you don't
[21:52] understand life that if you plant a seed
[21:55] into the ground it's going to come up
[21:57] and and then it'll die and go back into
[21:59] the ground and it'll come up again
[22:00] there's a cycle of life life of this is
[22:03] the thing we got to know about he said a
[22:05] shepherd a shepherd didn't need no
[22:07] scholarship he had just he just had to
[22:09] know his sheep that's all he needed to
[22:12] know
[22:13] a chef she a shepherd knows a sheep
[22:16] knowing the sheep what does that mean
[22:18] how do you call sheep a shepherd knows
[22:20] how to call sheep a shepherd knows how
[22:23] you get a sheep to come a shepherd knows
[22:25] how to get a sheep to surrender his life
[22:27] a shepherd knows what will help the
[22:29] sheep a shepherd knows what what a sheep
[22:32] needs to eat a shepherd knows what's
[22:34] best for the sheep a shepherd is there
[22:36] to watch over the sheet and guard them
[22:38] from the enemy because a shepherd knows
[22:40] what the enemy looks like because a
[22:42] shepherd can tell a goat from the sheep
[22:44] he can tell a wolf and sheep's clothing
[22:46] from their sheep a shepherd is going to
[22:47] watch out for things a shepherd knows
[22:50] what's the best way to protect the sheep
[22:52] a shepherd knows how to lay down in the
[22:54] door of the sheepfold and when all the
[22:56] sheep get in he can't nothing can hit in
[22:58] and the sheep can't get out because the
[23:00] sheep knows the shepherd knows the sheep
[23:03] a shepherd knows how a sheep is born a
[23:06] shepherd knows how to deliver a little
[23:08] baby sheep and a shepherd knows how to
[23:10] make a sheep grow a shepherd knows how
[23:13] to make a sheep come to a place where
[23:15] they can buy a wall come to a place
[23:16] where they can do what a sheep is
[23:18] supposed to do that's what a shepherd
[23:21] does because he knows the sheep and
[23:23] brother i'm saying god the great wisdom
[23:25] and the fountain and resource of all
[23:27] wisdom would choose such a person as
[23:29] that such a person in loneliness and
[23:31] humility a meek little shepherd somebody
[23:34] that all they knew about was sheep that
[23:35] didn't have a great big intellectual
[23:37] understanding of education that they
[23:39] didn't have all these lld's and
[23:40] everything but yet they knew god and
[23:43] they wanted god more than all else and
[23:45] he said and bypass all the well-trained
[23:47] scholars that's trained to know that he
[23:50] said would choose a person such as that
[23:53] and then he corrected it persons
[23:55] persons rather
[23:57] as that
[23:59] persons
[24:00] why persons
[24:02] because there's persons that are going
[24:04] to take this message of malachi 4 gonna
[24:06] take what's been preached and they're
[24:08] going to preach it it's got to be
[24:09] prophesied again there's persons that
[24:11] are going to preach this message he said
[24:13] notice the highest heavens hastening to
[24:15] honor earth's most humble and unlearned
[24:17] the highest of heaven came down to make
[24:19] itself known to the lowest of the earth
[24:22] bypassing all between to make itself
[24:24] known to common herdsmen coming to give
[24:26] these common herdsmen the greatest
[24:29] message
[24:30] of all times and we've got the greatest
[24:33] we we've got something to preach i
[24:35] believe we've got a message that we can
[24:37] pre we've got they had a message that
[24:39] they can preach at luther's day and they
[24:41] got a message that they can preach in
[24:43] wesley's day but what about now we've
[24:45] got a message that now we can preach
[24:47] that the messiah is here he's come back
[24:50] in flesh he's a man he's moving in his
[24:52] people he's using your hands and using
[24:55] your feet and he's being identified in
[24:57] your midst how do you know he's here by
[24:59] the bible because i know whatever his
[25:02] word is whatever his word is believed
[25:04] he's there in the midst he promised that
[25:07] where the two and the three would be
[25:08] gathered in his name and if you're
[25:10] gathered tonight in his name he's here
[25:12] moving among you that's the promise of
[25:14] his word it doesn't matter if i don't
[25:17] feel it it doesn't matter if i don't see
[25:19] the pillar of fire yet i know because i
[25:21] can i believe his word and i believe if
[25:24] he's spoken he's got to make it come to
[25:26] pass
[25:28] brotherhood setting god hiding himself
[25:30] and simplicity today we're so scientific
[25:33] till we can tell how many molecules it
[25:35] takes to make an atom
[25:39] how many electrons and so forth and
[25:41] split that atom and tell you how it's
[25:42] done
[25:43] make an atomic bomb and then we can
[25:45] explain how we've done it but walk over
[25:47] a blade of grass that we cannot explain
[25:50] it's in simplicity that god reveals
[25:52] himself in the simplicity of a little
[25:55] shepherd's heart
[25:56] a little shepherd on the side of a
[25:58] mountain that don't know nothing about
[25:59] nothing but yet he knows about god he
[26:02] wants to know about god he said don't
[26:04] ever try to educate yourself to god
[26:07] when you do you educate yourself away
[26:09] from god see
[26:10] god is not known by education god is
[26:14] known by faith and the first stroke that
[26:17] the devil took was on the educational
[26:18] program and man lost his fellowship with
[26:21] god he must know god by faith not what
[26:24] he can explain by what he believes that
[26:27] he can't explain that we just vice verse
[26:30] of the picture
[26:31] you don't know you don't find god by
[26:33] going to the doctor and saying well well
[26:35] he said i'm gonna get sick you don't
[26:37] know god by trying to be instructed in
[26:40] it but you know god by a spiritual
[26:42] revelation but god comes down and makes
[26:45] the word alive in your heart then you're
[26:47] living by faith
[26:49] and he said here he comes with the
[26:51] greatest of all the messages
[26:53] what was the message
[26:55] what was the shepherd's message
[26:58] he said it here and what was it what
[27:00] why why did
[27:01] why did it come to shepherds messiah is
[27:04] here now
[27:06] messiah is here now and to make that
[27:08] known he bypassed all the train
[27:11] to make it known to humble shepherds
[27:14] he said the shepherds now was the one
[27:16] who received the message
[27:18] and now noticed where the message was
[27:21] and the most unlikely place
[27:23] that anyone would expect it to come
[27:26] the most unlikely place
[27:31] everything about this story was unlikely
[27:34] the place where jesus was born was
[27:35] unlikely
[27:36] everybody was expecting him to come to
[27:38] the great big cathedrals and synagogues
[27:41] and
[27:42] to the great big mighty men of renowned
[27:45] of the religious day to the caiaphas and
[27:48] and the gamaliels and all those
[27:51] they would exp everybody would expect
[27:53] the angels to deliver their message to
[27:54] the great people but he came down to the
[27:56] little humble the little lowly
[27:59] now notice where the message was and i
[28:01] wondered tonight if we were looking for
[28:03] the true message of the lord jesus
[28:05] i wonder if it would be an unlikely
[28:07] group
[28:08] a unlikely group that that knows their
[28:10] god that unlikely group that the world
[28:12] is overlooked a little unlike a group
[28:14] that's not afraid to praise god and and
[28:17] raise their hands in worship and
[28:19] and and cry a little bit and shout and
[28:21] because that they know god an unlike
[28:23] likely group that the world would look
[28:25] at and say well well i don't want to be
[28:27] like that an unlikely group that's been
[28:29] born of real birth had a real word but
[28:32] not just some dried up birth but they've
[28:35] been born again by the word they got
[28:37] down in the mud and mire or whatever it
[28:39] took to be born again that's a little
[28:41] unlikely group like the shepherds on
[28:43] that mountainside maybe in a rain storm
[28:46] maybe in a hail storm whatever it was
[28:48] overlooked by the world and their
[28:50] loneliness and meekness he said i wonder
[28:52] if that wouldn't be where we'd find him
[28:55] the most unlikely place into the most
[28:57] unqualified
[28:59] speakers
[29:00] the most unqualified speakers
[29:04] shepherds didn't know nothing about
[29:06] speaking he said
[29:08] shepherds didn't know nothing about
[29:09] speaking
[29:11] i think i think in the message of the
[29:13] hour we've got some of the greatest
[29:14] speakers the world has ever known was
[29:16] through stammering lips and stuttering
[29:18] tongues and all this they can't hardly
[29:20] get their words out sometimes but yet
[29:22] they're delivering a message with the
[29:23] greatest message that the world has ever
[29:26] known that christ is here
[29:28] shepherds know nothing about speaking
[29:30] only calling sheep that's all a shepherd
[29:33] knows about us how to get a sheep into
[29:35] the kingdom how to get a sheep up to the
[29:37] altar how to get a sheep to a place
[29:39] where they're not afraid to raise their
[29:41] hands and crowd to god and say i know i
[29:43] need something from you a shepherd knows
[29:46] how to call sheep
[29:48] he said well maybe that's why i come
[29:52] in john chapter 10 jesus answered him
[29:54] and said i told you and you believe not
[29:56] the works that i do in my father's name
[29:58] they wear witness of me but you believe
[29:59] not because you are not of my sheep
[30:02] because you are not of my seat sheep as
[30:04] i said unto you my sheep my sheep hear
[30:07] my voice and i know them and they follow
[30:09] me and you know that's what a shepherd
[30:11] knows a shepherd knows that if he can
[30:14] get out of the way and deliver the word
[30:15] of god to the people it'll call sheep a
[30:18] shepherd knows that the sheep will
[30:20] respond to the voice of god and what is
[30:22] the voice of god in this day the voice
[30:24] of god is the same word that the prophet
[30:27] preached because what the prophet
[30:28] preached is the same word that paul
[30:30] preached and what paul preached is the
[30:32] same word that the son of man preached
[30:35] and if we're preaching the same word
[30:36] that the son of man preached that's the
[30:38] voice of god the voice of god is being
[30:41] preached my sheep will hear my voice and
[30:44] i know them and they follow me how do
[30:46] you know but why does he know them
[30:48] because a shepherd knows as sheep a
[30:50] shepherd can tell a sheep from a goat
[30:52] and a shepherd knows what a sheep wants
[30:54] a shepherd knows what a sheep will feed
[30:56] on a shepherd knows everything about
[30:59] what is what will cause a sheep to
[31:01] prosper
[31:02] brotherhood said there was a promised
[31:03] word he said the wisdom the infinite
[31:06] wisdom of almighty god did it to make
[31:08] known to them the greatest message ever
[31:10] was the messiah is now on earth and god
[31:14] takes the nothings
[31:16] the nothings
[31:17] to do something with
[31:19] he takes the nothingness to do something
[31:21] with you you ever notice how that john
[31:23] it's look like he just comes out of the
[31:24] wilderness and nothing come out of the
[31:26] wilderness didn't have any his mama and
[31:28] daddy were passed on and he come out of
[31:30] the wilderness eating eating uh eating
[31:32] bugs and honey and
[31:34] and everybody would look at him well
[31:35] you're nothing but yeah he had the
[31:37] greatest message his message was i'm
[31:39] going to identify to you where the son
[31:41] of man is i'm going to point the way to
[31:43] him you think about all elijah and i
[31:46] think with first or second kings chapter
[31:48] 17 when he first appears on the scene
[31:50] where did he come from nothing and
[31:51] nobody that nobody didn't even knows
[31:53] where his ancestry was but he came on
[31:55] the scene why he because god takes the
[31:58] nothings and he does something weird and
[32:00] he came out of the scene declared in the
[32:01] word of the lord he came out of nowhere
[32:04] from nothing
[32:06] brother said the religious world was
[32:08] trained to believe his word and then
[32:10] when his word was vindicated before
[32:11] their very eyes they denied the word
[32:14] that was made vindication
[32:16] think of what taken place
[32:18] think of what caused them their training
[32:21] caused them not to recognize the very
[32:23] word
[32:24] made flesh for their day
[32:26] the very training that they had in their
[32:28] schools with the very best of teachers
[32:31] he said man is always praising god
[32:34] now listen to this we've heard this so
[32:36] many times before now listen to what it
[32:38] really means
[32:39] man is always praising god religious man
[32:42] for what he done
[32:43] for what he did back with john the
[32:45] baptist and elijah what he did back with
[32:48] paul and irenaeus and martin columba
[32:50] luther and wesley
[32:52] and always pointing to what he's going
[32:54] to do one of these days one of these
[32:56] days christ is going to be revealed in
[32:58] the flesh one of these days the lord
[33:01] will come the lord himself will descend
[33:03] with a shout and the voice of the
[33:05] archangel and the trump of god
[33:07] one of these days
[33:08] and he said and then ignoring what he's
[33:10] doing
[33:12] so what is the shepherd's message
[33:15] look to what he's doing right now
[33:17] he's doing something right now he's
[33:19] revealing his word in flesh right now
[33:23] brother brown said can you see can you
[33:25] see what god is doing now can you see
[33:27] what he's doing right now he said they
[33:29] did not recognize him because it didn't
[33:31] fit their interpretation
[33:34] now all this time as the shepherds were
[33:37] there they were here in the the serenade
[33:38] of the angels out there in the field and
[33:40] the mountains all this time
[33:42] as jesus was being born and all these
[33:44] events were taking place the magi had
[33:46] seen a star and they were journeying
[33:48] over from the from the east all the way
[33:50] from india or iran or or wherever it was
[33:53] that they were coming from all the way
[33:54] in the east that that had heard they had
[33:57] heard originally heard about things from
[33:59] daniel and have been instructed so they
[34:02] didn't have all the truth but they had
[34:03] enough to know that god was going to be
[34:06] manifested in flesh one day and they
[34:07] went on a journey and they started
[34:08] coming for two years traveling traveling
[34:12] and all this time the message was being
[34:14] preached
[34:15] a message was being preached by these
[34:17] little shepherds
[34:18] brother adam said did you know there's
[34:20] not a speck of history says that any of
[34:22] them seen that star at all
[34:24] why it wasn't given to them they wasn't
[34:26] looking for such so it was a
[34:27] supernatural star that these magi are
[34:29] looking at
[34:30] but these wise men know that there will
[34:33] be a star of jacob rise that's the
[34:35] prophecy of balaam believe it or not
[34:37] that there will be a star of jacob rise
[34:39] and they were looking for because
[34:41] because they could read daniel had
[34:43] pointed them to balaam's prophecy and
[34:44] said look look at that right there he's
[34:46] coming and they were believing in that
[34:48] and trusting that
[34:49] and he said the star led them to the
[34:51] religious capital of the world
[34:54] the star led them not to bethlehem
[34:58] not to bethlehem but it led them to
[34:59] jerusalem
[35:00] and when they got to jerusalem
[35:03] when they got to jerusalem then they the
[35:05] star didn't lead them any further
[35:07] then they had
[35:09] they needed a man to tell them
[35:11] they needed somebody they needed
[35:13] somebody that god could speak through
[35:15] i i'm i'm putting it like that now
[35:18] and as soon he said as soon as they
[35:20] entered those gates
[35:22] to jerusalem
[35:24] that star
[35:25] the supernatural that had led them
[35:27] refused to show them anymore
[35:30] they got to jerusalem the religious
[35:32] capital of the world where you would
[35:34] think that with all the cathedrals and
[35:36] all the synagogues somebody would know
[35:38] where to find christ manifested in the
[35:41] flesh
[35:42] and brother brown said after two years
[35:44] of traveling after two years of the
[35:46] shepherd's ministry nobody knew where to
[35:49] find jesus the angels had told the
[35:52] shepherds take this message and go
[35:54] around tell everybody where he where you
[35:56] can find him the shepherds knew the
[35:58] shepherds knew where to find him
[36:00] but the whole world the whole religious
[36:02] world had overlooked it
[36:04] he said up and down the streets these
[36:06] fine man rich man with fine draped
[36:08] camels and so forth up and down the
[36:10] street saying where is he that's born
[36:12] king of the jews we saw his star in the
[36:14] east what a what a sight to see all
[36:17] these men with their camel trees and
[36:18] their turbans and their fine garments
[36:20] and all their all their bodyguards and
[36:23] all their entourage going down the
[36:24] street saying we know he's got to be
[36:26] here somewhere surely somebody knows how
[36:30] to find him
[36:31] and that great religious capital
[36:33] brotherhood said after two years after
[36:36] two years of the shepherd's message
[36:38] still didn't have the answer
[36:41] oh no nothing about it
[36:43] still didn't have the answer after two
[36:45] years of the shepherd why why did they
[36:48] not have the answer because they could
[36:50] not believe that the little poor little
[36:52] humble little group of shepherds would
[36:54] have the answer that all their
[36:56] synagogues and all their cathedrals and
[36:58] all their denominational ideas could not
[37:00] even begin to prohibit they could not
[37:02] fathom that a little poor little group
[37:04] of people would have the answer
[37:07] he said the head of all the
[37:08] denominations didn't have the answer
[37:11] what an honor how fitting it is to a
[37:13] shepherd to receive a message of a
[37:15] newborn sheep it could come to nothing
[37:17] else but a shepherd
[37:19] i believe tonight that we've got the
[37:21] answer that the world is groping for and
[37:23] that's why the gospel has got to be
[37:25] preached it first must be preached in
[37:26] all the world and then he can come it's
[37:28] got to be preached and what's going to
[37:30] be preached the same thing that the
[37:32] shepherds preached to the little
[37:33] shepherd's message that christ is here
[37:36] what you're looking for is here he said
[37:38] in this state the shepherds was in then
[37:40] in their stable with their lamb a
[37:42] vindicated message that they had heard
[37:45] how beautiful
[37:46] and the presence of the messiah a
[37:48] vindicated word of their message when
[37:50] the shepherds heard that the messiah was
[37:52] on earth and came into his presence
[37:55] right in their own environment
[37:58] right in an environment that they were
[38:00] comfortable with a shepherd ain't going
[38:02] to be comfortable with a and a with all
[38:04] this stained glass and and and and
[38:07] spooky singing with a choir that echoes
[38:09] bounces back and forth off the walls and
[38:11] an incense swinging on a big long pole
[38:13] or something all that
[38:15] a shepherd ain't gonna be comfortable
[38:16] with all that but you give a shepherd
[38:18] the word in an environment where people
[38:20] are comfortable with praising god and
[38:22] coming to the altar and springing out of
[38:24] their seat and singing songs of worship
[38:26] that's where a shepherd is comfortable a
[38:28] shepherd is comfortable in a little
[38:29] manger a shepherd is comfortable in a
[38:31] place where where he he's comfortable
[38:34] with the sheep why because he can he
[38:35] wants to lay his head down on the sheep
[38:37] and get that lantern all over him and
[38:39] get get all get all up in the in the
[38:42] sheep and just get get get familiar with
[38:44] the sheep get familiar with the word get
[38:46] familiar with god get him into a love
[38:48] relationship with god the word and he
[38:50] said they they found the message to be
[38:52] true it was vindicated there how that
[38:55] must have made those man feel to find
[38:58] that god had done this great thing for
[39:00] them to bypass all the world all the
[39:03] intellectual giants and reveal to little
[39:05] people that didn't deserve nothing amen
[39:09] how that should make us feel that he's
[39:11] been born in the manger of our heart the
[39:13] manger of our stinking rotten little
[39:15] heart
[39:16] just like he was born in the main in
[39:18] that manger there where the animals were
[39:19] over to the side making their fertilizer
[39:22] and doing all kind of maybe there was a
[39:23] little a little puddle of urine over to
[39:25] the side and it was just a stinking mess
[39:27] but yet that's what god wanted to be
[39:29] born and he wanted to be born in your
[39:31] heart he wanted to change your heart
[39:33] despite all of your past and despite all
[39:36] of your history
[39:39] he come down and somebody that was
[39:41] humble and low and meek and that's where
[39:44] he wanted to make his home
[39:47] he said some of these herds might not
[39:49] might not have even been able to sign
[39:51] their own name
[39:52] you think about that
[39:54] think about peter peter but jesus said
[39:57] simon loves now me more than these and
[39:59] he said feed my lambs why did he say
[40:02] that because he knew he was a shepherd a
[40:05] little man that that all he knew how to
[40:07] do was fish and
[40:08] all he wanted to do was just serve god
[40:10] and one day he told found a man that
[40:13] said feed my lambs feed my lambs and he
[40:16] told him that three times do you love me
[40:17] well yes lord i know you know i love you
[40:20] and he kept telling him feed my sheep
[40:23] feed my sheep why because he found a
[40:24] real shepherd he found a real shepherd
[40:27] that could preach the statue of a
[40:28] perfect man he found a real shepherd
[40:30] that one day he'd be able to preach
[40:32] preach open the door to the baptism of
[40:34] the holy ghost to those on the day of
[40:36] pentecost he found a shepherd that knew
[40:38] how to call sheep
[40:41] lovers thou mean more than these
[40:43] he saith unto him feed my limbs yea lord
[40:46] thou knowest that i love thee he saith
[40:48] unto him feed my sheep and lord thou
[40:50] knowest all things thou knowest that i
[40:53] love thee jesus saith unto him feed my
[40:55] sheep feed my sheep because peter was a
[40:57] preacher he found him a good preacher
[40:59] and that's what preachers do preachers
[41:02] feed the sheep features are the ones god
[41:04] i believe god is still choosing
[41:06] shepherds god wants to find somebody
[41:08] that'll preach his word somebody that'll
[41:10] get out to get out of the way and knows
[41:12] what god wants done with the word
[41:16] somebody that'll feel completely at ease
[41:18] in a manger a little stable somebody
[41:20] that'll feel completely at ease with all
[41:22] the little sheep
[41:24] with the sheep praising god
[41:26] he said the shepherds felt completely at
[41:28] ease in that place with god's lamb
[41:31] when a good shepherd over the sheep can
[41:32] see the word of god made plain and
[41:34] vindicated of what he promised to do
[41:37] that shepherds right at home
[41:40] and there they looked and saw what the
[41:42] angel told him manifested right in front
[41:44] of him you know what makes a shepherd
[41:46] feel at home when he sees somebody get
[41:49] their deliverance somebody to get their
[41:51] deliverance from depression he sees the
[41:52] word of god may manifest it right in
[41:54] front of him somebody get a born-again
[41:56] experience somebody begin to testify
[41:58] about what god has done for them
[42:00] somebody begin to shout and praise god
[42:02] because god is real and not dead laying
[42:05] up in a grave somewhere but he's alive
[42:07] that's when a preacher that's when a
[42:08] shepherd feels at home
[42:11] it don't make a shepherd feel at home to
[42:13] get new cars and get gifts piled on them
[42:15] and all these get t-shirts and mugs but
[42:17] what makes a preacher feel at home is
[42:19] when he sees god's word manifested in
[42:21] your life in a sheep's life to see you
[42:24] bear forth war
[42:26] [Applause]
[42:27] and brother brown said let a true
[42:29] shepherd of the word preach it and the
[42:31] power of the resurrection that jesus
[42:33] christ is ashamed same yesterday today
[42:36] and forever peter said on the day of
[42:38] pentecost the promises unto you and to
[42:40] your children unto them that's a far off
[42:42] even as many as the lord our god shall
[42:44] call and whoever he calls the promise
[42:46] and the same blessing is true that
[42:48] promise will be made manifest because
[42:51] god's god spoke it he promised it and
[42:53] when you see that come to pass
[42:56] that's where we feel at ease he said let
[42:58] a genuine word feeding shepherd see that
[43:00] vindicated all the theologians in the
[43:02] world can't take it away from him
[43:04] because he know god said so when it
[43:07] happens it's just god's word always
[43:10] his word was made flesh and was dwelling
[43:12] among them and they knew it not
[43:16] poor humble shepherds
[43:18] that had no education
[43:20] with a message
[43:21] poor almost shepherds with a message
[43:24] and what was their message i can prove
[43:26] it to you
[43:28] this is the baby
[43:30] this is the messenger
[43:32] i can prove it to you why because i've
[43:34] had an experience i was there
[43:36] i went where the angel told me to
[43:39] i followed his direction and i was there
[43:41] i saw him with my own eyes i experienced
[43:44] it that's what the shepherd's message is
[43:46] he said here they had the evidence
[43:49] and after the evidence
[43:50] go up there the stable
[43:52] and see if that baby isn't laying there
[43:56] that's that's why we come to church we
[43:59] enter into the sanctuary of the lord so
[44:00] with all the other believers present
[44:02] bringing our little licks of fire
[44:03] together to prove to the unbeliever that
[44:06] comes into the house of god this this
[44:07] baby is real this child is real to prove
[44:11] to the make believer that there's
[44:12] something real about this gospel you see
[44:15] why it's not just the preacher in the in
[44:16] the in the church but everybody is
[44:18] involved the people are pulling and amen
[44:21] because we're all involved the people
[44:22] are praising god because they're
[44:24] believing it the people are saying amen
[44:26] because that's the hebrew word in mana
[44:28] which means faith and when you say amen
[44:30] that means i believe it we're all in one
[44:33] in one accord believing together because
[44:36] the proof is here
[44:37] the proof that the baby is is laying
[44:39] there and he said it's so simple that's
[44:41] how the wise always overlooks it it's so
[44:44] simple it confounds them they look for a
[44:46] god way out there when he's right here
[44:51] they're looking for something way on
[44:52] there when it's right here with them now
[44:55] christ risen from the dead the same
[44:57] yesterday
[44:58] today
[45:00] and forever
[45:01] the shepherds were praising god
[45:04] with a message
[45:06] he said they were shepherds they know
[45:08] sheep
[45:10] a shepherd was the only thing would
[45:12] accept a lamb
[45:14] i'm going to take this coat off if y'all
[45:15] don't mind
[45:18] a shepherd
[45:20] was the only thing would accept the lamb
[45:22] they were the only kind
[45:24] that would accept it they were the only
[45:26] kind that would look there that little
[45:27] baby laying there and say yep that's the
[45:29] word
[45:30] that's the one that we've been looking
[45:31] for
[45:32] and they know how to take care of it
[45:34] they knew what to do with it
[45:36] and so is it today when we get the
[45:38] lamb's message when we get the lamb's
[45:40] message we know what it's for
[45:43] we we know what to do with it
[45:45] we know is to birth children of god into
[45:47] the kingdom
[45:49] we know it's got to be preached it's not
[45:51] to be said at home with and on sunday
[45:53] morning when everybody else is at church
[45:55] and and we just sit at home and don't
[45:57] come to church it's it's got to be
[45:58] preached you got to you got to get your
[46:00] lick of fire around other believers we
[46:02] got to get together he said here was
[46:05] humble shepherds in a stable adoring
[46:07] emmanuel god himself made flesh and
[46:09] laying in a stable and after they had
[46:11] adorned him adored him and realized that
[46:14] the message that they had been preaching
[46:15] was vindicated
[46:17] they were out praising god with the most
[46:19] incredible message
[46:21] of an angel
[46:23] now you think about that
[46:25] when they heard when they realized that
[46:27] it was vindicated
[46:28] they began to praise god
[46:31] they didn't just sit there like like
[46:32] brother branham would use the expression
[46:34] like a bump on a pickle
[46:35] they didn't just sit there but they
[46:36] began to praise god
[46:39] they began to something something was
[46:40] taking place in their lives you see
[46:42] anybody that's been delivered of
[46:44] something they don't just sit well i
[46:46] guess i've been delivered from
[46:47] depression
[46:48] no they something has taken place
[46:51] well i guess i guess god finally did
[46:53] save me
[46:54] no there's there's a praise going on
[46:57] there's a singing going on
[46:59] [Applause]
[47:03] they said a shepherd that couldn't write
[47:05] his name smelling like a sheep pen
[47:07] walking down the street hollering glory
[47:09] to god in the highest we know that he's
[47:12] on earth
[47:13] walking down the street smelling like a
[47:15] sheep pen and he said listen the first
[47:18] time the first time that
[47:20] they were out there on the field and the
[47:23] angels came to to to tell them about the
[47:25] message and the angels began to sing a
[47:27] song and he talks about the first time
[47:30] that angels had a celebration it was in
[47:32] heaven when they talked to when they
[47:33] told joe remember job where was you
[47:36] before i laid the foundation of the
[47:37] earth god talking to job when the
[47:39] morning star sang together and the sons
[47:41] of god shouted for joy now that was he
[47:43] said that was the first time ever angels
[47:45] ever sing a celebration what was in
[47:47] heaven but now they had come to earth to
[47:50] sing a celebration the first time they
[47:52] ever sang on earth was to shepherds
[47:55] in luke chapter 2 the one we were just
[47:57] reading glory to god in the highest
[47:59] on earth peace good will toward men
[48:01] because whenever there's a birth
[48:03] whenever a king is born there's always
[48:05] singing in other words there's always
[48:08] going to be praising when when he was
[48:10] born and you did you didn't something
[48:12] happen you didn't something within you
[48:15] oh oh god something's taken place
[48:18] you didn't just sit there and well
[48:21] oh well but some there was life in you
[48:24] and whenever there's a bird when there
[48:26] was a birth of this king that was
[48:28] singing the shepherds couldn't contain
[48:30] themselves and they went through the
[48:31] streets saying glory to god and the
[48:33] angels were shouting
[48:35] and when something takes place in your
[48:36] life you cannot contain why why were
[48:39] they why was there singing because there
[48:41] was a new creation a new create what
[48:43] kind of a creation god putting himself
[48:46] in mortal flesh tabernacling himself in
[48:49] you tabernacling himself in the in the
[48:52] in the flesh of a little baby they're
[48:53] laying in a manger
[48:55] he said god was fixing to make another
[48:57] creation he created moral earth mortal
[49:00] life angels sing in heaven but here he's
[49:02] creating a new life
[49:04] eternal life for man
[49:07] and he's singing to his subjects through
[49:08] angels
[49:09] on the earth
[49:11] not in heaven
[49:13] he said there's got to be singing
[49:15] kings wouldn't have been saying
[49:17] king is what kings have been saying to
[49:19] he said the people wouldn't have sang to
[49:20] him because they didn't believe him
[49:23] that people wouldn't have sang to him
[49:26] because they didn't believe him but
[49:28] shepherds would
[49:29] and the angels did why why did they sing
[49:33] because they believed
[49:35] and he said
[49:36] now brother brown laid it out so i'm
[49:38] just repeating what he said he said here
[49:40] it comes you might as well get it he
[49:42] said that's the reason today that
[49:44] people's ashamed
[49:45] to praise god
[49:47] they're ashamed of christ
[49:49] their shame now see if they believed god
[49:51] and were were not
[49:53] not ashamed to raise their hand
[49:55] not ashamed to raise their hand in the
[49:57] middle of service or even in singing
[49:59] when you when you don't when a song is
[50:00] being sung does it touch your heart and
[50:02] you can't lift your hand up because i'm
[50:05] ashamed of what other people are going
[50:06] to think now on the day of pentecost
[50:08] they weren't ashamed
[50:09] oh the day of pentecost they went where
[50:11] they went down and they were they were
[50:13] telling everybody this is that i'm going
[50:15] to tell you i know where the baby is
[50:17] let's say like i know where the baby is
[50:19] in the manger i've been there i've
[50:20] experienced something and they weren't
[50:22] ashamed now he said if you believe if
[50:25] you believe you're not ashamed to pray
[50:27] now i i can tell by the expressions on
[50:29] your face this is a little bit rough
[50:32] because
[50:33] do you believe do you believe god enough
[50:35] to not be ashamed that when something
[50:38] takes place that you that you that you
[50:40] you you you'll do something something
[50:43] takes place he said god's gonna find
[50:46] somebody
[50:47] somebody that he can get praised through
[50:50] he's gonna find somebody that believes
[50:52] him enough can come to a place when
[50:54] they're believing where they ain't
[50:56] ashamed anymore
[50:58] yeah
[50:59] maybe tonight we're where maybe we're in
[51:01] a place where we'll well we believe
[51:03] but we we just kind of hadn't quite
[51:06] broke through that place where we're we
[51:08] believe enough to where we're not
[51:09] ashamed
[51:10] the way we believe enough to where we
[51:12] don't care what somebody else thinks
[51:14] i i think maybe maybe you know you see a
[51:16] lot of the young people they'll go to
[51:18] camp and they'll get real enthused about
[51:19] the message and they'll be like i've had
[51:21] a real experience but they come back to
[51:23] the church and and they hadn't broke
[51:25] through enough to say amen in church
[51:28] you see god wants you to be able to
[51:30] break through enough to where you ain't
[51:31] ashamed that where you can say amen or
[51:33] you can praise god a little bit maybe
[51:36] maybe what we need is for the young
[51:37] people to break through enough to where
[51:39] the old people can see that something's
[51:41] taken place maybe young people can be an
[51:42] example to the old people and praise god
[51:45] a little bit lift up your hands and
[51:46] praise like the shepherds did and say
[51:48] something's happened to me something
[51:50] happened to me at camp
[51:52] something happened to me in my prayer
[51:53] closet something happened to me that
[51:55] night beside my bed when something god
[51:58] came down and entered into my soul and
[52:00] quickened the word that i heard
[52:02] something happened to me and i'm not
[52:03] ashamed of it anymore i know that god is
[52:06] real i can point you to the place where
[52:08] he was born i can point you to the
[52:10] manger where he lays and i know he's
[52:12] there
[52:14] and not be ashamed
[52:17] in luke chapter 19 it says when he was
[52:19] come now now even now the descent of the
[52:21] mount of olives the whole multitude of
[52:23] the disciples
[52:24] began to rejoice and praise god with a
[52:26] loud voice for all the mighty works that
[52:28] they had seen saying blessed be the king
[52:31] that cometh in the name of the lord
[52:33] peace in heaven and glory in the highest
[52:35] throwing their palm
[52:36] palm leaves in front of jesus as he rode
[52:38] in
[52:39] and they knew who he was and so they
[52:41] could not contain they began to praise
[52:44] god because they believed him they
[52:45] believed who he was and and some of the
[52:48] pharisees from among the multitudes said
[52:49] unto him master rebuked thy disciples we
[52:52] we're uncomfortable with all this noise
[52:54] we're uncomfortable with all this praise
[52:56] we're uncomfortable in a little stinky
[52:58] manger where people are believing where
[53:00] their sheep are we're uncomfortable with
[53:02] all these sheep around you praising and
[53:04] he answered and said unto them i tell
[53:05] you that if they should hold their peace
[53:07] the stones would cry out somebody's
[53:09] gonna believe god and somebody's gonna
[53:11] praise him and in that moment if
[53:13] somebody had not praised god then the
[53:16] rocks would have cried out
[53:18] maybe tonight you're a rock there's
[53:20] somebody somebody's got to praise god
[53:22] and you say well brother brother bob
[53:24] tonight maybe you're trying to drum up
[53:25] the people maybe you're trying to stir
[53:27] something up maybe i'm trying to preach
[53:29] the word maybe i'm saying exactly what
[53:31] the prophet said
[53:37] brother brown said his subjects must
[53:39] sing to him his subjects have to sing to
[53:41] him what are you singing back to god
[53:43] you're singing back his praises because
[53:45] god has done something in your life
[53:48] god has done something if god has really
[53:50] done something in your life you're not
[53:52] ashamed to tell the world
[53:54] you're not ashamed to stand up and
[53:56] praise god you're not ashamed to say
[53:58] something loud you're not ashamed to say
[54:00] amen in church if god has done something
[54:03] for you
[54:04] brother bob that's too strong that hurts
[54:06] my feelings well sometimes the word
[54:08] sometimes the word because the word is
[54:10] shaping you it's molding into you what
[54:12] god wants you to be and god wants you to
[54:14] be a bold lion of the tribe of judah he
[54:17] wants you to be bold with the message he
[54:19] wants you to not care what the devil
[54:21] thinks see about you he wants you to not
[54:23] care about what your co-workers think
[54:25] about you he won't
[54:28] if we if we care about what other
[54:30] believers think about us what what where
[54:32] are we
[54:35] we should be so comfortable in the house
[54:37] of god he said his subjects must sing to
[54:39] him and his subjects then was his angels
[54:41] and they sang to his shepherds which was
[54:43] to take his message
[54:45] throughout all scriptures
[54:47] the message of redemption
[54:49] has been given by
[54:50] shepherds and through sheep
[54:54] now that's a quote to take home with you
[54:56] throughout all sacred scriptures
[54:59] the message of redemption has been given
[55:01] by shepherds
[55:02] and through sheep
[55:04] well brother bob i think that we should
[55:05] just take the message and we should just
[55:07] go home with us with it and we should
[55:09] just not go to church anymore but we
[55:10] should just play the tapes at home and
[55:12] we should not believe in shepherds
[55:14] anymore we should not believe in
[55:15] preachers anymore we should not come
[55:17] together with fellowship anymore but yet
[55:20] this is a quote from brother branham
[55:22] that there are going to be shepherds
[55:25] because it is a scriptural
[55:27] type it's a scripture it runs all
[55:29] through the word and he said throughout
[55:31] all sacred scriptures the message of
[55:33] redemption has been given by shepherds
[55:35] and through sheep the reason people
[55:37] don't like shepherds and don't have
[55:39] stopped coming to church and stop
[55:40] listening to preachers because it hurts
[55:42] their feelings
[55:43] like what i was just preaching a few
[55:45] moments ago
[55:46] sometimes the preaching of the gospel
[55:48] hurts your feelings and when the
[55:49] preaching of the gospel hurts your
[55:51] feelings that don't mean to go home and
[55:52] stop going to church and and we'll just
[55:54] do it the easy way we'll just press play
[55:56] when we get home but you
[55:58] a real sheep a real sheep is going to
[56:00] want to be molded into the image of its
[56:03] creator
[56:04] a real sheep is going to want to
[56:07] look like its shepherd
[56:10] and that's why god gave us shepherds
[56:13] he said throughout all sacred scriptures
[56:15] the message of redemption has been given
[56:17] by shepherds and through sheep
[56:19] the message always came
[56:21] by sheep
[56:23] because from the very beginning
[56:25] it was through sheep
[56:27] and by shepherds
[56:29] that he revealed himself
[56:32] all was shadows and types
[56:36] now you go all the way back to the very
[56:38] beginning the very first message will
[56:40] say that brother said the first message
[56:41] that was ever heard there in the garden
[56:44] after adam and eve had done what they
[56:45] did
[56:46] there they were god came down and killed
[56:48] to kill the lamb and clothed them with
[56:50] with the garments of the lamb skin and
[56:52] and then he preached a message where did
[56:54] he preach that he said he preached that
[56:56] message over the top of a dead sheepskin
[56:59] from the very beginning over the top of
[57:01] a dead sheepskin now follow me as we
[57:03] kind of type this he said over the top
[57:05] of a dead sheepskin that god had slew
[57:07] and wrapped adam and eve in it the first
[57:09] message to a condemned generation was
[57:12] over the top of sheepskin
[57:16] think about that you picture that
[57:18] god preaching a sermon in the garden
[57:21] and he said and the lord said unto the
[57:22] serpent because thou hast done this thou
[57:24] are cursed above all cattle above every
[57:26] beast of the field upon thy ability that
[57:28] thou shalt go and thus shalt thou eat
[57:29] all the days of thy life preaching that
[57:31] sermon over sheep's king
[57:33] and he said i'll put enmity between thee
[57:35] and the woman and between thy seed and
[57:37] her seed it shall bruise thy head and
[57:38] thou shalt bruise his heel he's
[57:40] preaching a sermon that one day there's
[57:41] going to come a lamb to come
[57:43] and he was preaching that about that
[57:45] lamb over sheepskin
[57:49] he said the prophets of the old
[57:50] testament drape themselves in
[57:52] sheepskin signifying their faith
[57:56] that sheep because why that sheep that
[57:58] shepherd was guiding all the old
[58:00] testament saints
[58:01] all the new testament saints all is
[58:04] guiding continuously looking forward
[58:07] is signifying their faith in his word of
[58:09] the coming perfect lamb
[58:11] we we're following we're following the
[58:13] great shepherd who's leading and guiding
[58:15] us somewhere and they wore sheepskins in
[58:18] the old testament because the word that
[58:20] they preached was was looking forward
[58:23] one day one day there's coming one
[58:25] that's going to save the world from
[58:27] their sins if they can believe and
[58:29] that's why the gospel was preached over
[58:31] sheepskins elijah and john and elisha
[58:34] and all those prophets with wrapped up
[58:36] in sheepskin he said the the word of god
[58:39] came to them over the top of sheepskins
[58:42] abraham was a herdsman
[58:44] isaac was a husband little shepherds
[58:46] jacob was a herdsman moses was a
[58:48] herdsman david was a herdsman all of
[58:51] god's representatives usually were
[58:53] herdsmen little shepherds wrapped up in
[58:56] sheepskin preaching the word of god and
[58:58] their message was leading them to christ
[59:01] they didn't know they could it was way
[59:03] far off but yet the word that they were
[59:05] preaching was leading them to christ as
[59:08] they were wrapped up in sheepskin
[59:11] and he said now now we're going to find
[59:13] out why it come to shepherds why i had
[59:16] to be shepherds
[59:17] they knew the sheep is helpless
[59:20] without the shepherd to guide them
[59:23] brother bob i don't like that i want to
[59:25] be on my own i don't want to go to
[59:27] church i just want to sit at home and
[59:28] listen to tapes and things he said a
[59:30] sheep is perfectly helpless and he
[59:32] cannot go by himself aren't you glad
[59:34] that you have shippers together if when
[59:36] you've got a rough you've got a rough
[59:38] question you can go to somebody and and
[59:40] ask them a question i battled with this
[59:42] i battled with this question i battled
[59:44] with this problem how do i get rid of
[59:46] this problem in my life and you can go
[59:48] to a shepherd that you have confidence
[59:50] in and say where is it in the word
[59:53] where is it in the word where show me
[59:55] where it is and he said that's the
[59:57] reason god likened his believing
[59:59] children under sheep they got to be
[1:00:01] guided
[1:00:03] they gotta be guided he said but watch
[1:00:05] what's guiding you
[1:00:07] don't get a goat he'll walk you to the
[1:00:09] slaughter pen
[1:00:10] god never give us a goat he gave us his
[1:00:12] son the holy spirit to guide us we're
[1:00:15] not guided by you know it's it's real
[1:00:17] fashionable for the young people today
[1:00:19] to have those hats and the t-shirts and
[1:00:20] things that say go to crosstalk i don't
[1:00:22] like that because think about what that
[1:00:24] symbolizes still a believer a goat
[1:00:26] greatest of all time
[1:00:28] goat now now even that doesn't make any
[1:00:30] sense why why do we want to elevate
[1:00:32] ourselves to whether we're the greatest
[1:00:34] of all time or to say that somebody one
[1:00:36] of our superstars or whatever is the
[1:00:38] greatest of all time i wear a hat that
[1:00:40] says goat on it why would i want to be
[1:00:42] identified with a goat that's lead
[1:00:44] that's separated away from the sheep
[1:00:46] we're not goats we're sheep
[1:00:52] he said god never give us a goat he gave
[1:00:54] us his son the holy spirit to guide us
[1:00:57] he is a god not some man-made herdsmen
[1:01:00] with man-made ideas that's following the
[1:01:02] ideas of a denominational leadership or
[1:01:05] some something that somebody conjured up
[1:01:07] he said but a god-given herdsmen who
[1:01:09] feed the sheep upon sheep food
[1:01:12] why because a shepherd a shepherd knows
[1:01:14] what sheep need
[1:01:15] a sheep need sheet food
[1:01:17] he said isn't it strange that god
[1:01:19] likened us to sheep a sheep is the most
[1:01:21] helpless thing there is there's nothing
[1:01:24] so insufficient of defense than the
[1:01:25] sheep a rabbit can run a squirrel can
[1:01:27] get in a tree a dog can bite a lion can
[1:01:30] tear a horse can kick a bird can fly
[1:01:32] but a sheep stands helpless
[1:01:35] a sheep has no
[1:01:37] natural defenses
[1:01:39] and he said that's the way god wants us
[1:01:41] to realize that we're totally
[1:01:43] insufficient
[1:01:44] we need we need some help
[1:01:46] when you come into the house of god and
[1:01:48] realize you need some help then you're
[1:01:49] getting somewhere when you realize that
[1:01:51] there's something lacking in your life
[1:01:53] and you're you're getting somewhere
[1:01:55] like that ethiopian eunuch sitting there
[1:01:56] in his chair and he was pouring through
[1:01:58] the scriptures and he was he was reading
[1:02:00] and he said i don't know i don't know
[1:02:02] what this is i don't know what i'm
[1:02:04] reading about what
[1:02:05] what is this
[1:02:07] and it was the spirit of god that told
[1:02:10] philip that see we're not following the
[1:02:12] leadership of men
[1:02:14] it's the leadership of the holy ghost
[1:02:16] and that's where people get all trapped
[1:02:18] up they think well we're not we're this
[1:02:19] this sermon brother bob is about the
[1:02:21] great shepherd it is about the great
[1:02:23] shepherd the great shepherd moving in
[1:02:25] his people and the great shepherd moved
[1:02:27] in philip and said go join yourself to
[1:02:29] that chariot that that man needs some
[1:02:31] help he needs some holy spirit guidance
[1:02:34] and that holy spirit guidance was in a
[1:02:37] man
[1:02:38] named philip
[1:02:39] then the spirit said unto philip go near
[1:02:41] and join thyself to this chariot and
[1:02:42] philip ran his thinner to him and heard
[1:02:45] him read the prophet isaiah and said
[1:02:46] understand us thou with thou readest and
[1:02:49] he said how can i except some man should
[1:02:52] guide me but it wasn't a man it was
[1:02:54] supernatural revelation that god had
[1:02:57] given to philip that was guiding him
[1:02:59] you see you see how how dangerous it is
[1:03:02] to preach this almost we're not
[1:03:04] following the leadership of a man
[1:03:06] when you put your confidence in your
[1:03:08] pastor you put your confidence in the
[1:03:10] elders of the church you're not putting
[1:03:11] your confidence in a man you're putting
[1:03:13] your confidence in the holy spirit
[1:03:15] leadership
[1:03:16] and the holy spirit moving in the church
[1:03:20] the holy ghost is what's leading us
[1:03:23] our confidence is not even in brother
[1:03:24] branham the man our confidence is that
[1:03:27] god came down and used that man as a
[1:03:29] mouthpiece to speak to him words that
[1:03:32] echo on even today even though that man
[1:03:35] is now in the grave our confidence is
[1:03:37] not in a man but our confidence isn't a
[1:03:40] god that can use a man as a mouthpiece
[1:03:42] and speak through him speak to you so
[1:03:44] that you can get your need answered
[1:03:47] you know that's why sometimes when the
[1:03:48] young people go to camps and things or
[1:03:50] they're in in services i remember zach
[1:03:52] telling me this one year after he got
[1:03:54] back from a camp he said dad every
[1:03:56] question that i had was answered
[1:03:58] why because that wasn't a man behind the
[1:04:00] pulpit it was god speaking through that
[1:04:03] man to speak to his need to speak to to
[1:04:06] answer every problem that he had
[1:04:09] it's the holy ghost in the church the
[1:04:12] sheep have got to be fed
[1:04:14] brother abraham said you know there's a
[1:04:15] lot of sheep food and there's a lot of
[1:04:17] food you give your sheep would kill it
[1:04:19] and i'm so glad that god was mindful
[1:04:21] enough of his sheep to get the right
[1:04:23] kind of shepherd the lord jesus to give
[1:04:26] us the word of god
[1:04:29] what a pity it is today that they try to
[1:04:30] feed sheep slop
[1:04:32] but a sheep won't eat it
[1:04:35] why
[1:04:36] i'm trying to i'm trying to hurry
[1:04:37] through some of my notes here he said
[1:04:38] why why will a sheep not eat sloth
[1:04:40] because a sheep
[1:04:42] knows
[1:04:43] his voice the voice of the shepherd
[1:04:46] now now
[1:04:48] to just kind of skip over some things
[1:04:49] you think about how
[1:04:53] think about the beauty and the poetry of
[1:04:55] this that the way that we know that
[1:04:57] we're hearing the truth is because we
[1:04:59] can recognize the voice of god
[1:05:02] when you're sitting in church if it if
[1:05:04] it dovetails with the scripture you know
[1:05:06] that you're hearing from god and the way
[1:05:08] that god knows his sheep
[1:05:11] is also by your voice
[1:05:13] the way that he you know him as his by
[1:05:16] his voice and the way that you he knows
[1:05:18] you
[1:05:19] is by your voice
[1:05:26] let me skip through all these things
[1:05:28] i'm trying to find that so i can read it
[1:05:30] to you
[1:05:31] he said the shepherd knows his sheep
[1:05:34] back in 1954 brother adam was preaching
[1:05:36] in questions and answers he said anybody
[1:05:38] in here ever hear a goat cry
[1:05:40] and and we'll be closing in just a
[1:05:42] minute he said brother you better be a
[1:05:44] shepherd if you want to know the
[1:05:45] difference the difference between a
[1:05:47] sheep and a goat
[1:05:49] how do you tell the difference
[1:05:50] because a shepherd can tell that the
[1:05:52] voice
[1:05:53] they can tell the difference between the
[1:05:55] voice
[1:05:56] now now people have told me before well
[1:05:58] a goat will say ma and a sheep will say
[1:06:00] ba i don't i don't know if i can't tell
[1:06:02] the difference it sounds the same to me
[1:06:04] both sounds like bad
[1:06:06] and brother ryan said a goat will cry
[1:06:08] just exactly like a sheep
[1:06:10] uh-huh he said let a little old billy
[1:06:12] goat get hung up out there somewhere and
[1:06:14] a little sheep on one side going by and
[1:06:16] then buy just the same buy and buy
[1:06:19] how are you going to tell the difference
[1:06:20] but a shepherd can the great shepherd
[1:06:23] can tell the difference
[1:06:24] and he said now listen to this he said
[1:06:26] i've heard them down at the altar just
[1:06:28] crying and crying
[1:06:29] oh god crying away
[1:06:33] sobbing away like that
[1:06:35] and he said i goat
[1:06:37] all the time how can you tell the
[1:06:38] difference
[1:06:40] but the shepherd can amen
[1:06:42] by the voice
[1:06:44] he said that's right
[1:06:46] shouting he said i've seen them shout
[1:06:48] till they just and they run across the
[1:06:50] floor and jump up and down and shout but
[1:06:53] that's not it
[1:06:54] not your emotion but your voice
[1:06:57] that's how you tell him and how he tells
[1:06:59] you
[1:07:00] by you by the voice he said in making
[1:07:03] the valley full of ditches he said did
[1:07:04] you ever hear a goat bleep a goat and a
[1:07:07] sheep's almost the same thing and i've
[1:07:09] heard goats crying when they act like
[1:07:11] sheep it takes a real shepherd to know
[1:07:13] the difference
[1:07:14] you hear a goat squealing that sounds
[1:07:16] just exactly like a sheep but a shepherd
[1:07:20] knows the voice
[1:07:22] what kind of voice brother bob
[1:07:24] now i'm not not a voice that is easily
[1:07:26] interpreted interpreted or impersonated
[1:07:30] i believe the same kind of voice that
[1:07:32] when an angel told mary you're going to
[1:07:34] have a child she answered back
[1:07:37] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:07:40] and i believe god was pleased with that
[1:07:42] he could look at that and say that's
[1:07:44] that's a sheep right there
[1:07:45] i believe when brother brown was sitting
[1:07:47] on the other side of that wall there and
[1:07:48] hattie wright was listening to that
[1:07:50] through that through that wall and she
[1:07:51] she heard brother around testifying
[1:07:53] about that that squirrel and she was
[1:07:55] sitting over there and she said brother
[1:07:56] brown
[1:07:57] that's nothing but the truth
[1:07:59] i believe god was pleased with that he
[1:08:01] was so pleased that he said you tell her
[1:08:03] whatever she says she's gonna get amen
[1:08:05] why because that's a sheep that's a
[1:08:07] sheep answering back you see that then
[1:08:10] it don't matter how much you squall and
[1:08:11] how much you scream but it's your voice
[1:08:13] answering back in other words
[1:08:16] do you believe god
[1:08:17] do you have a revelation of this message
[1:08:20] do you know can you do you know where
[1:08:23] the baby is laying in the manger have
[1:08:25] you heard the message of the shepherds
[1:08:27] telling you where you can find this baby
[1:08:30] and do you know have you listened can
[1:08:32] you or are you like the people when the
[1:08:34] magi came and said surely he's got to be
[1:08:36] around be around here somewhere
[1:08:38] and you're like i don't know
[1:08:41] i don't know where to find him
[1:08:43] maybe he's over there maybe he's maybe
[1:08:45] he's
[1:08:46] up there and two states away or whatever
[1:08:49] and he knows his sheep he can identify
[1:08:51] as sheep
[1:08:53] he can identify sheep by their voice
[1:08:55] and by what they eat
[1:08:57] in first john chapter 2 love not the
[1:08:59] world neither the things that are in the
[1:09:00] world if any man love the world the love
[1:09:02] of the father is not in him so if you
[1:09:04] love the world but you don't love the
[1:09:05] word if you're not interested in coming
[1:09:07] to church that shows something's wrong
[1:09:10] now now now we'll get it we'll get into
[1:09:12] the closing here
[1:09:13] we'll close in just a minute but brother
[1:09:15] brother brown he used moses a type of
[1:09:17] that great shepherd prophet and he used
[1:09:19] him as a type with that with that
[1:09:21] shepherd's staff
[1:09:23] and he had that shepherd staff and he
[1:09:24] he's comparing moses a type of the great
[1:09:27] shepherd prophet he said with that
[1:09:30] shepherd's staff
[1:09:32] god made a way talking about a why
[1:09:35] did it have to be shepherds preaching
[1:09:36] the word over sheepskin
[1:09:38] he wrapped up in sheepskin with a
[1:09:40] shepherd's staff leading the way and
[1:09:43] that shepherd's staff
[1:09:44] meant something
[1:09:46] he made a way he said he never lost to
[1:09:48] one of them as they went on their
[1:09:49] journey
[1:09:50] neither did they go hungry or their
[1:09:52] clothes didn't even get threadbare moses
[1:09:54] the shepherd led them those who will
[1:09:56] follow will never be lost follow the
[1:09:58] shepherd moses that shepherd prophet had
[1:10:02] three
[1:10:03] gifts to prove that he was who he said
[1:10:06] he was
[1:10:08] three gifts to vindicate his ministry
[1:10:09] and calling to the elders of israel and
[1:10:11] to pharaoh and the first two gifts had
[1:10:13] something to do with his occupation of
[1:10:14] the shepherd of fur with with being up
[1:10:17] even a prophet to the people
[1:10:20] the first sign
[1:10:22] was to turn a rod that that that uh that
[1:10:24] staff into a serpent and the second was
[1:10:27] to turn his hand into leprosy and the
[1:10:29] third
[1:10:30] was to take that water out of the nile
[1:10:32] river in egypt and turn it into blood
[1:10:34] but now now brother brown really focused
[1:10:36] in this message if you go back and
[1:10:38] listen to it which i encourage you to do
[1:10:41] go back and listen to how he lays out
[1:10:43] he's typing these these first two signs
[1:10:46] that god he said the first two signs had
[1:10:48] a voice with him a voice of the voice of
[1:10:51] prophecy he said a voice of of their
[1:10:54] future the future of the children of
[1:10:57] israel
[1:10:58] now the third sign was if you reject
[1:11:00] that word if you reject it then you're
[1:11:02] it's turned you it the waters turned to
[1:11:04] blood it's a sign of death a symbol of
[1:11:06] death a word rejected those first two
[1:11:08] things were were telling them in other
[1:11:10] words it was a god the shepherd leading
[1:11:12] them telling them leading them to the
[1:11:14] promised land leading them to the
[1:11:16] opening of the word
[1:11:18] and he said watch that pole that
[1:11:20] shepherd staff
[1:11:21] he took that shepherd's staff and
[1:11:23] wrapped the brazen serpent around it and
[1:11:25] they would anybody that would look at
[1:11:26] that shepherd's staff would be healed
[1:11:29] watch that pole watch the serpent watch
[1:11:32] the red sea as he he held that rock that
[1:11:34] shepherd staff over the red sea
[1:11:36] whatever that he did now it was
[1:11:38] symbolizing something he said he was
[1:11:39] going to change nature
[1:11:42] to make it work for them
[1:11:46] look at that shepherd's goat making a
[1:11:48] way for them to go
[1:11:50] the shepherd staff he said by that
[1:11:52] shepherd staff not a textbook not their
[1:11:56] not their learning
[1:11:58] not a theologian's idea but a shepherd's
[1:12:00] staff a shepherd's rod guiding his sheep
[1:12:03] making the way clear as they went
[1:12:05] towards the promised land the shepherd's
[1:12:07] staff their their god with their fault
[1:12:09] they were following not the words of a
[1:12:11] man but they were following the words of
[1:12:13] god
[1:12:15] he wrapped a brass serpent around the
[1:12:17] shepherd's sheep goat in the wilderness
[1:12:19] and that was speaking of true atonement
[1:12:21] coming for sickness and sin and then he
[1:12:23] when he put that shepherd's staff down
[1:12:25] on the floor and in front of the
[1:12:26] impersonators
[1:12:28] and it ate up the other two
[1:12:30] of the other two staffs and brother
[1:12:32] brown said that was typing that my word
[1:12:34] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:12:36] word will never fail
[1:12:38] so what were they following they were
[1:12:40] following the word
[1:12:41] they were following the word as they
[1:12:43] went on their journey
[1:12:45] that shepherd staff
[1:12:47] and now that second sign though he put
[1:12:49] his hand into his bosom
[1:12:51] and brother brown said now see this this
[1:12:53] is i love this type because this gives
[1:12:55] us something to preach
[1:12:57] he said he put he put his hand into his
[1:12:59] bosom his right hand into his bosom
[1:13:01] he said now there he stands holding his
[1:13:03] right hand over his heart
[1:13:05] where the hidden secrets of redemption
[1:13:08] had been hid since the foundation of the
[1:13:09] world
[1:13:10] he put his right hand over his heart
[1:13:13] there's a secret that god wanted to
[1:13:15] reveal
[1:13:17] and he said here's why shepherds
[1:13:20] jesus is god's right hand this is jesus
[1:13:24] we all know
[1:13:25] there's moses portraying him exactly
[1:13:28] he held the secrets of the father and he
[1:13:31] showed them to us
[1:13:32] well notice watch him pull from his
[1:13:34] bosom his right hand
[1:13:36] smitten with deadly leprosy that's what
[1:13:38] happened to christ on the cross he was
[1:13:40] smitten with he was smitten with every
[1:13:42] uh
[1:13:43] just
[1:13:44] everything was poured out on him because
[1:13:46] of our sin
[1:13:47] showed what god would do with his right
[1:13:49] hand
[1:13:50] he said how moses was must have felt
[1:13:52] when he pulled his right hand from over
[1:13:54] his heart out of his bosom and his hand
[1:13:56] was smitten with leprosy
[1:13:58] leprosy symbolizes sin incurable and
[1:14:01] especially in its last stage and
[1:14:03] brethren that's where the world was when
[1:14:05] god pulled his right hand christ from
[1:14:07] his bosom
[1:14:08] notice he said it was the prophet
[1:14:11] shepard that smote himself he's the one
[1:14:13] that pulled his hand out he took by the
[1:14:15] commandment of god and put his own hand
[1:14:17] into his bosom and pulled it out
[1:14:19] submitting with leprosy he did it
[1:14:21] himself and christ said i lay my life
[1:14:24] down no man takes it from me and he
[1:14:27] pulled and put his hand back in there
[1:14:28] and pulled it out again and it was it
[1:14:30] was made clean he said that secret what
[1:14:33] secret the secret of christ the secret
[1:14:36] of christ christ in flesh again
[1:14:39] that secret had been in god's bosom all
[1:14:41] these years
[1:14:42] covered by his right hand jesus the
[1:14:44] secret
[1:14:45] in the back part of god's mind
[1:14:47] the secret of god's healing laid in the
[1:14:49] bosom of jesus christ or god he was on
[1:14:52] the right hand of god that's the only
[1:14:54] sheep that held in his bosom the secret
[1:14:57] he said it came quick and it left quick
[1:15:00] no sooner the right hand was drawn from
[1:15:02] the bosom the second time the deadly
[1:15:04] disease was gone
[1:15:05] when he drew it the second time
[1:15:08] and on calvary's cross when he had paid
[1:15:10] the penalty of sin for us all he said
[1:15:12] it's finished
[1:15:13] it didn't take a year
[1:15:15] it was finished right then
[1:15:18] that's why isaiah says for he was
[1:15:20] wounded for our transgressions he was
[1:15:22] bruised for our iniquities the
[1:15:24] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:15:26] and with his stripes we are healed
[1:15:27] because you uh moses playing out that
[1:15:29] story right there putting his hand into
[1:15:32] his bosom and bringing it out
[1:15:34] symbolizing that there's a secret a
[1:15:36] secret of christ all of these things
[1:15:38] that are hidden in christ have got to be
[1:15:41] preached and it was given from christ to
[1:15:44] us on the day of pentecost to preach
[1:15:47] that's why it had to be shepherds
[1:15:50] somebody's got to preach this secret
[1:15:52] the hidden secret he said the believers
[1:15:54] whose names were written in the book of
[1:15:56] life predestinated from the foundation
[1:15:58] of the world it was finished that very
[1:16:00] minute that jesus said it was finished
[1:16:03] and extended it down to you and i
[1:16:05] in the form of his word
[1:16:07] the hidden secret of his great heart was
[1:16:10] revealed by a prophet shepherd it was
[1:16:12] revealed by a shepherd
[1:16:15] prophet shepherd
[1:16:17] now this is when he gets into preaching
[1:16:19] y'all okay for just a few more minutes i
[1:16:21] i know i do bad on wednesday night i
[1:16:23] just preach and preach and i don't mean
[1:16:24] to wear you out or anything but i i got
[1:16:27] a message i got a shepherd's message
[1:16:31] he said no wonder the mountains jumped
[1:16:33] and shouted on that day
[1:16:35] no wonder the sun hit its face and
[1:16:37] screamed its shore talking about calvary
[1:16:40] he said no wonder all nature broke loose
[1:16:42] the wind shook the trees until they
[1:16:45] shook and shook enjoyed and jumped they
[1:16:48] seen the prophet ship prophet shepherd
[1:16:51] on the mountain redeem every name
[1:16:54] on the book of life
[1:16:56] and they seen that their own nature was
[1:16:58] redeemed
[1:16:59] they screamed and jumped and the world
[1:17:02] went into an earthquake
[1:17:04] he said like any meeting
[1:17:06] like any meeting like a meeting like
[1:17:08] this
[1:17:09] like a camp meeting like any meeting
[1:17:11] when the shepherd reveals to you
[1:17:14] that it's finished and how how is he
[1:17:17] going to do that but if the word is not
[1:17:19] preached the word has got to be preached
[1:17:21] and when the word is preached that is
[1:17:23] finished for you a word of deliverance
[1:17:25] is preached for you then it's finished
[1:17:28] and then the earth will shake you'll
[1:17:29] jump and and all these things that he
[1:17:31] just outlined just like he's outlined on
[1:17:33] the day of on the day of calvary that
[1:17:35] day that was symbolized with moses
[1:17:38] taking his hand
[1:17:40] out of his bosom
[1:17:41] and it being finished it was finished
[1:17:44] the great prophet shepherd had brought
[1:17:47] them the message
[1:17:48] and they were delivered the prophet
[1:17:50] shepherd we're not preaching the words
[1:17:52] of a man but we're preaching the message
[1:17:54] of a prophet shepherd and brother that's
[1:17:56] why in this sermon he switches all you
[1:17:58] know i like it when he switches you pay
[1:18:00] attention to though he's talking about
[1:18:01] something and he starts talking about
[1:18:03] something else and he all of a sudden he
[1:18:05] starts talking about no man has a right
[1:18:07] to enter the sacred desk to preach the
[1:18:10] word until he has did as moses did meet
[1:18:13] god himself no man has a right to preach
[1:18:16] the word until he's met god for himself
[1:18:18] because if if he hasn't he's just
[1:18:20] preaching his own ideas but if he's met
[1:18:23] god on that sacred sands
[1:18:25] it's the word of god
[1:18:27] he said no man by a theological degree
[1:18:29] or some doctor's degree has a right
[1:18:31] behind the pulpit to claim the message
[1:18:33] of jesus christ until he's first met god
[1:18:36] face to face in the pillar of fire do
[1:18:38] you see what a sublime message this is
[1:18:41] why it had to be shepherds
[1:18:43] why
[1:18:44] it's got to be preached
[1:18:46] that's what i believe brother brown was
[1:18:47] saying in this sermon he said he's no
[1:18:49] right to call himself a messenger
[1:18:51] because all the theologians in the world
[1:18:53] couldn't explain that away from you it
[1:18:55] happened to you
[1:18:56] you were there you know about it just
[1:18:59] like those shepherds that went and they
[1:19:01] knew about what the angels had told them
[1:19:04] because they saw the baby wrapped in
[1:19:06] swaddling clothes they saw mary and
[1:19:09] joseph they sat and listened to mary and
[1:19:11] joseph's testimony as mary told them
[1:19:13] about how the angel had told her you're
[1:19:15] going to have a child and it's going to
[1:19:16] be named jesus and they were there and
[1:19:19] that when they left that place they had
[1:19:21] a message they had a message because
[1:19:23] they had experienced it he said i don't
[1:19:25] care what you don't care what anybody
[1:19:27] else says or how much they can say the
[1:19:29] days is gone it isn't so
[1:19:31] it happened to you
[1:19:32] and it's according to the word
[1:19:35] that's when the gospel will preach when
[1:19:37] when some when you've been through an
[1:19:38] experience with you've been on a journey
[1:19:41] and you're not just talking about
[1:19:42] something that you read about but you're
[1:19:44] talking about something that you've
[1:19:46] lived you're talking about something
[1:19:48] that you've gone through and he said
[1:19:49] that's the reason moses knew this voice
[1:19:52] had spoke to him it was a word voice
[1:19:55] that's how you know whether it's true as
[1:19:56] you're sitting here tonight if it's a
[1:19:58] word voice you see we've got a secret to
[1:20:01] preach and you the musicians can go
[1:20:02] ahead on that we'll close on this we've
[1:20:04] got a secret to preach we're not here to
[1:20:06] preach a creed and we're not here to
[1:20:08] preach man's ideas or our own petty
[1:20:10] thoughts or preach from our complexes
[1:20:13] but we've got a shepherd's message to
[1:20:15] preach
[1:20:16] a separate shepherd's message like paul
[1:20:18] saying there in first corinthians i
[1:20:20] determine not to know anything among you
[1:20:22] save jesus christ
[1:20:23] and him crucified
[1:20:25] that's what we're preaching
[1:20:27] christ is our shepherd
[1:20:29] and that's what we're preaching about
[1:20:30] amen
[1:20:31] do you believe that this afternoon
[1:20:34] it had to be shepherds
[1:20:36] why do they have to be shepherds to
[1:20:38] declare
[1:20:39] that the great shepherd is here
[1:20:41] he's here let's stand to our feet and
[1:20:44] just worship him a little bit thank you
[1:20:46] amen
[1:20:48] at the end of that sermon brother he
[1:20:50] asked the people he said how many of
[1:20:51] those that had to be a shepherd amen
[1:20:54] amen it had to be a shepherd
[1:20:57] as so many people are getting away from
[1:20:59] shepherds and getting away you can't get
[1:21:01] away from what brother brown taught
[1:21:02] about you can't get away from what he
[1:21:04] said it had to be shepherds it was
[1:21:07] shepherds then and as shepherds now
