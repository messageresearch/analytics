[2:35] my holy
[2:43] holy you want to see him this morning
[2:44] turn around and Shake somebody's hands
[2:46] say God bless you you just looked right
[2:49] at him
[2:50] hey man you love the Lord
[2:53] good to be in the house of the Lord
[2:54] again good to be with each and every one
[2:56] of you
[3:01] we pray that uh you had a good week
[3:06] today will be a refreshing for you
[3:09] that the Lord will give you something
[3:12] for taking chew on and live by
[3:16] the rest of the week amen until the
[3:18] pastor gets back
[3:19] went down last night and had some
[3:21] service with him down there by the mark
[3:22] and I did and I did a wonderful job for
[3:25] him and he's down there this morning so
[3:27] the Lord bless him and be with him
[3:29] he's going to try to make it back to the
[3:31] second service but I probably won't make
[3:34] it back
[3:35] because they're probably going to feed
[3:36] him natural food afterwards so it's
[3:40] about a couple hour drive back up here
[3:42] so he said he was going to try to make
[3:43] it but but uh we won't look for him but
[3:47] uh he's here in spirit anyway
[3:50] we thank God for a good solid Pastor he
[3:53] did a real good job last night I told
[3:55] him I said
[3:56] I said your voice don't go right bad
[3:58] when you're lying he was he was doing
[4:00] some preaching wasn't he brought Mark I
[4:02] mean he was doing some some some
[4:03] screaming
[4:05] your voice doesn't do that down here
[4:07] something's wrong
[4:09] of course goes out when you hear
[4:11] something so let's pray for his voice
[4:13] amen
[4:14] a couple of announcements we need to
[4:17] make
[4:18] and this is per brother Dale for those
[4:20] of you that don't like for me to tell
[4:22] you something this is from Brother Dale
[4:24] his own he he put his stamp on this and
[4:26] Richard wrote it down on the phone this
[4:28] morning
[4:29] you'll notice outside and I think each
[4:32] and every one of you that came up here
[4:33] yesterday and put up those
[4:36] um gym sets outside so let's give them a
[4:38] hand
[4:43] made
[4:45] um food for him so they had something to
[4:47] eat so let's give them a big hand
[4:51] now here's the rules
[4:53] those things were about seven or eight
[4:56] thousand dollars
[4:58] so
[4:59] let's try to keep them at least on the
[5:01] rafter takes place
[5:03] they're not indestructible
[5:06] but they are pretty well made they're
[5:08] very actually they're very what made
[5:09] Brother Richard got online and really
[5:11] did a wonderful job finding the right
[5:13] gauge and the right you know where paint
[5:15] won't come off and and all that so
[5:17] Brother Richard did a good job in
[5:19] searching for these for these um things
[5:22] for the for the killers
[5:26] you know I'm telling brother Mark I
[5:28] thank God for for a church family right
[5:31] and I'm going to read something about
[5:33] that in just a second that I got off the
[5:35] internet but sister Monica's class and
[5:38] younger now listen to me
[5:41] maybe Joe can put this on the internet
[5:42] so we can look at it sister Monica's
[5:45] class and younger plays on the red blue
[5:48] and yellow playset
[5:51] Rachel sister Rachel's class and older
[5:54] on the green and brown playset reason
[5:57] being there's weight restrictions and
[6:00] weight limits
[6:01] and some of you parents can't keep your
[6:04] older kids off of some of them so we're
[6:06] going that's why we bought two sets
[6:09] that's exactly why we bought two
[6:10] different sets one is heavier Gates than
[6:12] the other one all right do the weight
[6:15] limit and older kids playing rougher
[6:18] all right if you wanted the kids to play
[6:19] together we would have gotten one place
[6:21] at
[6:21] so they're going to play in separate
[6:23] places all right
[6:24] now the older Sweden set we put down
[6:27] here it has baby swings in it for the
[6:30] little bitty baby so it's you know we
[6:31] got monkey bars we got swings something
[6:34] to keep the kids occupied between
[6:36] services
[6:37] all right now
[6:39] here's the Shocker parents watch your
[6:42] children
[6:48] you know I told brother Danny Sister
[6:50] George we were making a point downstairs
[6:51] and I want to make that point here you
[6:53] know
[6:55] parents
[6:56] until your kids leave your house you're
[6:58] their Holy Ghost that's right you are
[7:01] their Holy Ghost and you are responsible
[7:03] for what they do in your house
[7:07] you will be held accountable for what
[7:09] they do as long as they live with you
[7:11] know when they leave and go do their own
[7:12] thing there's nothing you can do right
[7:16] see it's not the parent it's not it's
[7:17] not the kid's job to get a haircut it's
[7:19] the parent's dog to make sure the kid
[7:20] gets there okay
[7:23] not the kids this is Parental
[7:26] delinquency we're talking about here
[7:27] brother Brown said that right he said
[7:30] that in the 60s what about now
[7:34] you're their Holy Ghost until they leave
[7:36] your house
[7:39] sorry mine were too
[7:42] I told my kids one time they said why
[7:44] can't we do this and that never I said
[7:46] because it's my hands
[7:48] and I wouldn't be mean I said I paid the
[7:50] bill
[7:51] I said if you'd like to make the house
[7:53] payment the car payment when I want food
[7:55] you go get it right right when my grand
[7:57] when my Gap my gas tank is empty I'm
[8:00] gonna come to you for gas money when I
[8:02] told them you can ask Josh when I told
[8:04] them they're like whoa
[8:06] I guess we'll do what you're saying
[8:10] see that's what constitutes having a
[8:11] home you're the father you bring in the
[8:14] money you raise the kids
[8:16] you give them money for food you give
[8:18] them money for gas
[8:19] but they're going to do what you say
[8:21] daddy told me one time he said I don't
[8:22] care if you're 30 years old if you put
[8:23] your feet under my table and you live
[8:25] here with me you're gonna do what I ask
[8:26] you today all right so same way with
[8:29] kids
[8:32] and regrettably I'll ask home so I
[8:34] didn't
[8:35] somehow
[8:39] all right now listen we still have kids
[8:41] going behind the storage buildings and
[8:42] going behind the big white fence beyond
[8:44] that fence is not our property that big
[8:47] long fence
[8:49] it goes back to parents watching your
[8:52] kids not somebody else's your kids
[8:56] all right
[8:57] now that's goes to another thing the
[9:00] seats in the back that say parents with
[9:02] children
[9:04] that needs to be because we're getting
[9:05] bigger folks we got to start putting
[9:08] some rules down to have we wish not
[9:10] it's not because we're picking on you
[9:14] but if you've got a child
[9:16] you need to be sitting back there in the
[9:18] back where those seats there on the you
[9:20] can read them on the side the deacons
[9:22] will be telling people if they don't
[9:26] have children they need to move up front
[9:28] okay
[9:29] now also this is an ongoing problem that
[9:33] brother Dale has addressed and so have I
[9:35] so the deacons are going to be enforcing
[9:37] this Nursery is for children with
[9:40] parents only no exceptions whatsoever
[9:46] we've got people that that is a cry room
[9:48] that's where people need to go and feed
[9:50] their kids that's when people need to go
[9:51] and change their diapers we don't need
[9:53] adults in there
[9:54] if you're sick you can sit in the pastor
[9:57] study if you're sick you can sit
[9:58] downstairs if you want to if you're an
[10:00] older adult no they're kids now I've
[10:02] been downstairs and some kids be roaming
[10:05] around you know can't do that but
[10:07] Nursery is for children with parents
[10:09] only only Dickens will be instructed to
[10:13] have you leave that room if you're
[10:17] caught in there okay everybody
[10:18] understand that
[10:19] this comes from brotherdale
[10:21] and we're here to enforce it he's
[10:24] already addressed that one time and you
[10:27] know if he addresses it two or three
[10:28] times you know what's going to happen
[10:30] he's going to really put his foot down
[10:32] so Monica's class red and blue and
[10:34] yellow playset Rachel's class green and
[10:37] brown brown playset
[10:39] all right that's due to weight limits
[10:41] and there's plenty to play man those
[10:43] things look really good really beautiful
[10:45] out there you go take a look at them in
[10:47] between services
[10:48] but um you love the Lord the Lord's good
[10:52] to us but you know what you say well you
[10:55] know what we got the Holy Ghost we don't
[10:57] know the Bible says you need deacons
[10:58] elders
[11:01] yes
[11:02] yes we need to be led we have to be led
[11:05] okay
[11:07] um you know Jesus told us
[11:10] he said the Good Shepherd looks after a
[11:11] sheep and that's what the pastor does
[11:13] here he looks after his sheep all right
[11:16] now I want to read you something here
[11:18] it's called a silent sermon
[11:21] a member of a certain Church who
[11:23] previously had been attending Services
[11:24] regularly stopped going after a few
[11:28] weeks the pastor decided to visit him it
[11:31] was a chilly evening the pastor found
[11:32] the man at home alone sitting before a
[11:34] blazing fire
[11:35] guessing the reason for his pastor's
[11:38] visit the man welcomed him led him to a
[11:40] comfortable chair near the fireplace
[11:42] and waited
[11:44] the pastor made himself at home but said
[11:46] nothing
[11:48] in the grave silence he contemplated the
[11:51] dance of the Flames around the burning
[11:53] logs after some minutes the pastor took
[11:56] the fire tongs carefully picked up a
[11:58] bright burning Ember and placed it to
[12:00] one side of the Hearth all alone then he
[12:03] sat back in his chair still silent
[12:06] the host washed all this in quiet
[12:09] contemplation
[12:11] as the one lone Embers flame flickered
[12:13] and diminished there was a momentary
[12:15] glow and then its fire was no more
[12:18] soon it was cold and dead
[12:21] not a word had been spoken since the
[12:23] initial greeting
[12:24] the pastor glanced at his watch and
[12:26] realized it was time to leave
[12:28] he slowly stood up picked up the cold
[12:30] dead Ember and placed it back in the
[12:32] middle of the fire
[12:33] immediately it began to Glow
[12:36] once more with the light and warmth of
[12:39] the burning coals around it as the
[12:42] pastor reached the door to leave his
[12:43] host said with a tear running on his
[12:45] cheek thank you so much for your visit
[12:47] and especially for that fiery sermon
[12:50] I will be back in church next Sunday
[12:54] you get what he's what he was talking
[12:56] about
[12:57] take the Amber out and put it out here
[13:00] it gets cold and dead put it back in
[13:02] amongst all the little licks of fire
[13:04] fire comes back us again so he said that
[13:07] was a good story and a good lesson if
[13:09] you have your Bible let's turn to the
[13:10] Book of Ezekiel
[13:12] 36
[13:14] I'm going to read there we're going to
[13:16] also rather join them we're going to
[13:17] keep the
[13:19] we're going to keep the uh projector hot
[13:21] today because we're going to talk about
[13:25] a Christian's Journey
[13:28] now we've been through this before
[13:30] brother Dale's been through this several
[13:31] years ago but we got a lot of new ones
[13:34] and we want to kind of go through the
[13:36] life of a believer
[13:37] through the life of Abraham
[13:40] all right
[13:44] also I'd like to tell you that um
[13:48] we didn't get to go to brother Don's
[13:50] um
[13:51] a memorial service but we thank God for
[13:53] about four Brother Don
[13:56] he just sleepeth that's right he's
[13:59] asleep God preserved him
[14:01] God put him where nothing else can harm
[14:03] him anymore
[14:04] he's entered into the joy of the Lord
[14:07] but he's not in his complete state
[14:10] he's got to come back here and
[14:12] somebody's got to be alive to get him
[14:14] out and if we don't take this journey
[14:16] like Abraham did
[14:18] be nobody came right all right
[14:21] you know the the world has a what they
[14:23] call a bucket list everybody heard of a
[14:26] bucket list you know what that is we
[14:27] ever watched the movie you ever watch
[14:29] the movie The Bucket List what it is two
[14:31] old men they write down
[14:33] what they want to do before they die
[14:36] it's called a bucket list you put it in
[14:37] the bucket all right and they got out
[14:39] and said well I want to go to Paris I
[14:40] want to do this one to this well see I
[14:42] have a bucket left
[14:43] and it's called Jacob Fountain that's
[14:46] right
[14:48] Hannah Dale
[14:51] put your kids in there that's right
[14:53] that's my bucket list from now on that's
[14:55] right so the day we get out of here
[14:56] that's my bucket list I don't care about
[14:59] the things of the world I don't want to
[15:00] go to Paris I don't want to go to Rome I
[15:01] don't care about those things I want
[15:03] these kids saved I want them to save
[15:05] sanctify filled with the Holy Ghost
[15:06] Ashley

[15:10] Daddy was preaching last night he said
[15:11] speak
[15:12] don't be silent speak the word and go
[15:15] forward
[15:16] speak the people's name
[15:18] go forward thank you Lord for that
[15:21] that's my bucket list from now if you
[15:23] had anybody want to ask me what's
[15:24] important to me those people in church
[15:26] that's right amen that ember to be
[15:29] glowing again
[15:31] in an environment where they can grow
[15:33] one of my bucket list is as I marked it
[15:36] off because Robbie and Bruce back so
[15:38] praise God for that that was on my list
[15:40] amen all right and also Richard and
[15:43] Katrina they've been on my mind for a
[15:45] long time
[15:46] and and you know what prayers of the
[15:48] Saints will bring them back amen sorry
[15:51] to keep your standing Ezekiel 36.
[15:54] let's pray before we get started dear
[15:55] heavenly father we pray today Lord that
[15:57] you would just come Among Us in a
[15:58] special way
[16:00] Lord be an active participant in the
[16:01] service you take these words Lord and as
[16:04] you see fit father and your will be done
[16:07] not my will
[16:08] that you would Lord just open our eyes
[16:10] Lord with Isaac and our ears to hear
[16:12] what you have to say
[16:14] father forgive us of our sins and our
[16:16] many mistakes that we make toward you
[16:18] Lord and the mistakes that we make
[16:20] toward others father that we truly want
[16:22] to be Sanctified in your sight father
[16:24] that we can walk as the Bible says
[16:26] boldly but toward the throne of grace
[16:28] asking any petition and that we will
[16:31] agree that you will make that come to
[16:33] pass so if there be any sick among us
[16:35] Lord you said you sent your word and
[16:36] healed them
[16:37] delivered them from destruction so as
[16:39] the word Goes Forth today may you heal
[16:40] may you deliver may you say in Souls

[16:45] lord may you go now and and just touch
[16:48] the person Lord soften them up sweeten
[16:50] them up Lauren bring them back to you
[16:52] father give us our daily bread today
[16:54] Lord bless our pastor and be with him as
[16:56] he speaks Lord just continue to bless
[16:58] him and hold him up be with a little
[16:59] bride around the world Lord be with the
[17:01] missionaries be with each one here Lord
[17:03] it has a loved one that's lost that we
[17:05] may all Lord take that list Lord and
[17:08] hold it towards you Lord because the
[17:10] name means something father to call that
[17:12] name it means something but when I pray
[17:15] that you just bless the father in this
[17:16] service just be with us now in Jesus
[17:18] name we pray
[17:19] amen
[17:21] Ezekiel 36.

[17:32] late the hours getting late
[17:37] get them in while we can Ezekiel 36.
[17:40] verse 24 for I will take you from among
[17:44] the Heathen praise the Lord

[18:00] Ghost then will I sprinkle clean water
[18:05] clean water not dirty water clean water
[18:07] upon you and you shall be clean
[18:11] from all your filthiness and from all
[18:13] your Idols while I cleanse you a new
[18:14] heart also will I give you and a new
[18:16] spirit will I put within you and I will
[18:19] take away the Stony heart out of your
[18:20] flesh and I will give you a heart of
[18:23] Flesh and I will look at all those I
[18:25] will
[18:26] nothing you've done and I will put my
[18:29] spirit within you and cause you to walk
[18:32] in my statutes and you shall keep my
[18:34] judgments
[18:35] and do them and look it Stephen says you
[18:38] shall dwell in the land that I give your
[18:40] fathers and you shall be my people and I
[18:41] will be your God we're going to talk
[18:42] about Father Abraham let's turn to
[18:43] Romans 8.
[18:47] verse 30.
[18:50] we're gonna read a lot of scriptures
[18:51] today but we're going to take our time
[18:52] we got two Services praise the Lord
[18:57] thank you
[19:03] Romans 8
[19:06] verse 30.
[19:09] because I want you to get into your mind
[19:10] that when we talk today
[19:14] that if you're truly Justified now we
[19:17] know Abraham is a type of the believer
[19:21] but if you're truly Justified
[19:23] listen to what the Bible says moreover
[19:26] whom he did predestinate them he also
[19:28] called
[19:29] amen
[19:34] them he also called and whom he called
[19:39] then he also Justified because remember
[19:42] we're going to look today that
[19:43] Melchizedek met Abra Abram
[19:46] and justification yeah
[19:48] amen amen
[19:50] then he also Justified and whom he
[19:53] justified
[19:54] them he also
[19:57] glorify you may be seated in the Lord
[19:59] has blessed to the reading the word
[20:02] thank the Lord for each and every one of
[20:04] you coming today
[20:06] most of the time when the pastor is gone
[20:08] play hooky
[20:10] no hook you today
[20:14] now we're going to talk about Abrams
[20:17] Journey
[20:20] excuse me a moment I'm going to do my
[20:21] Deacon duty they said talk everybody's
[20:23] famous
[20:24] all right own
[20:28] air conditioning
[20:32] it's hot up here I'm already sweating
[20:34] down my back but I'm like I told him
[20:36] about man I'm just a hot natured person
[20:37] he said I'm going through menopause
[20:42] thanks buddy I thought we'd get you
[20:46] the code on you know just freezing to
[20:48] death and I've got the air conditioner
[20:50] on he's like what's wrong with you I
[20:51] said I'm hot he said you're going
[20:52] through menopause
[20:57] oh man demo was another one on the
[21:00] bucket list we can take that out
[21:08] Abram's Journey
[21:10] let's look at the first quote now most
[21:13] of you know these but we do have a lot
[21:15] of young ones that are here that really
[21:17] needs to know where they are
[21:20] brother Brown you said you can know
[21:22] where you are at any time with God right
[21:23] right by what not by what somebody tells
[21:26] you he said you would know where you are
[21:28] with God
[21:30] so God's got to speak to you sure he's
[21:31] going to speak to you through people the
[21:33] preachers through through the laity
[21:35] through the Elders of the church I I
[21:38] just don't believe that it's all the
[21:39] preacher's responsibility
[21:41] I believe elders and deacons and laity
[21:44] can talk together and grow in God yes
[21:47] all right so now let's read this quote
[21:49] here Hook from who's this Melchizedek
[21:52] and let's take it we're going to take it
[21:54] from attribute to us right now then
[21:56] we're going to late night aside and go
[21:59] into Abram's Journey notice now his
[22:01] attribute then the attribute was first
[22:02] God
[22:03] the thought the attribute itself all in
[22:06] one without being expressed
[22:08] then when he expressed secondarily he
[22:11] became then the word so there was God
[22:14] along with his thoughts before the
[22:17] eternal
[22:18] he had attributes right
[22:21] and and then God's thoughts are Eternal
[22:23] so when he thought of you and I when he
[22:25] thought of us
[22:27] it had to become word because he can't
[22:29] change his mind all right you and I can
[22:32] have a thought and we can dismiss it and
[22:33] you know go on and have another thought
[22:35] God can't have a new thought all right
[22:38] so the God's thoughts are Eternal then
[22:40] when he expressed secondarily he became
[22:42] then the word and then the word was made
[22:44] flesh and dwelt Among Us
[22:46] now we know that was Jesus Christ but
[22:48] remember God was in human flesh one time
[22:52] before that
[22:56] because of that
[22:57] all right
[22:58] I said we're going to be talking about
[23:00] the underlying meaning of this whole
[23:03] this whole sermon
[23:05] will be the man Melchizedek
[23:09] because he's without father mother he's
[23:12] without beginning or ending so if he was
[23:16] there with Abram and then he was there
[23:18] with Abraham and now he's here with you
[23:20] and I
[23:22] because Melchizedek became Jesus Christ
[23:24] that's right all right that's theophany
[23:26] now that actually walked and talk and
[23:29] looked at April
[23:31] is the same tiar from The Uber if you
[23:34] got the new birth right amen only one
[23:37] thing
[23:39] I've always said that's how people we
[23:41] can understand
[23:42] if you can't understand the Bible and
[23:45] understand this message
[23:47] then pray because with the new birth God
[23:50] is obligated that's right
[23:53] right obligated to show you the word
[23:55] amen he said he would he said I will
[23:58] come back as the comforter be with you
[24:01] even in you I will teach you things and
[24:04] show you things to come so he's
[24:06] obligated I know we have problems with
[24:09] the scriptures and we have problems with
[24:10] the message I'm not talking about that
[24:11] but if you're just like blank down and
[24:14] can't understand anything you need a new
[24:16] birth
[24:17] you need the new birth that's right
[24:19] because the new birth is the promise he
[24:22] promised he'd talk to you
[24:24] he promised he would give you these
[24:26] promises
[24:27] he promised Abram
[24:29] and Abraham same person but he promised
[24:32] them
[24:33] I'm gonna do it
[24:34] you're not gonna have anything to do
[24:35] with it sorry notice this is the
[24:38] beginning but before the eternal
[24:41] notice in the beginning was the word
[24:42] when the time began it was word
[24:44] but before it was word it was attribute
[24:46] a thought then it was expressed in the
[24:49] beginning was the expression the word
[24:51] now we're getting where Melchizedek is
[24:54] that's this mysterious person in the
[24:59] beginning was the word and the Word was
[25:00] with God and the Word was God when the
[25:02] word became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[25:03] hold that there now
[25:06] notice it's first being with Spirit God
[25:08] Supernatural all right
[25:11] the Grady Colonel second he began to
[25:13] form himself towards flesh and a
[25:15] theophany it's called the word a body
[25:18] this then is the state he was when he
[25:20] met Abraham
[25:22] was called Melchizedek he was in the
[25:24] form of theophany and I will get to that
[25:26] and prove it in a few minutes Lord will
[25:28] it now here's here's the uh uh quotes
[25:31] that I want us to see
[25:35] the next one we will scroll it up
[25:38] all right
[25:40] who is this 1965 now God at this stage
[25:43] of
[25:45] at this stage of his creation later
[25:47] formed into flesh Jesus we know that
[25:49] melchized it became Jesus Christ we know
[25:51] the flesh that Melchizedek had could not
[25:53] die for us so he had to come back in
[25:55] human flesh born of a woman because
[25:56] that's where all the trouble came all
[25:59] right but this was a grown man
[26:02] all right now God in this Stadium at
[26:06] this stage of his creation later formed
[26:08] into flesh Jesus from what from the
[26:10] great beginning Spirit then came down to
[26:12] the word
[26:13] bringing itself out the word doesn't yet
[26:15] make itself it's just spoken out in
[26:17] morphe later he becomes flesh Jesus
[26:20] mortal to taste death for all of us
[26:22] sinners
[26:23] when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek
[26:26] he unfolds here what all the attributes
[26:29] will do in the final end now what is an
[26:31] attribute a word word spoken now you and
[26:34] I were what attribute right
[26:37] right we came attribute straight to
[26:40] flesh then we become the word Jesus come
[26:44] from attribute
[26:46] word
[26:48] in the beginning with the word working
[26:50] with God and word was done right that's
[26:51] why he knew all things right
[26:53] he came to flesh to bring us to that
[26:56] attribute right to that word we we were
[27:00] born the word that's right we were born
[27:01] in sin shaken iniquity got all those
[27:03] quotes but we're not going to read all
[27:04] of them you ought to know that by now
[27:06] but he unfolds here what all the
[27:09] attributes will do in the final end now
[27:11] where are we
[27:14] who are we
[27:15] finally in talking about us right not
[27:19] talking about Luther away sleeping
[27:20] across not talking about two days ago
[27:23] three days ago amen all right he unfolds
[27:27] here what all the attributes were doing
[27:28] to finally live every son of Abraham
[27:31] every son of the faith will absolutely
[27:34] do the same thing
[27:36] what meat Melchizedek right just like
[27:40] Abraham did you're going to go through
[27:41] the same Journey that Abraham went
[27:44] through
[27:45] you're not gonna go around it we got to
[27:48] go through it all right
[27:50] because you know what a conqueror
[27:51] doesn't go around it a conqueror goes
[27:53] through it all right
[27:55] we're not here for a picnic we're here
[27:57] for a battle
[27:58] amen but I want to watch how we have to
[28:00] come also we see him revealed here Ruth
[28:02] and Boaz as a kid Redeemer how he had to
[28:04] come
[28:05] to be flesh all right just take that and
[28:07] hold it for just a minute
[28:09] so now let's turn to the Book of Genesis
[28:12] and let's go through
[28:13] we're gonna go through the life of Abram
[28:18] now Abram was called
[28:23] now keep this in the back of your mind
[28:25] remember we talked about the new heart
[28:27] the new spirit
[28:29] keep that in the back of your mind we're
[28:31] going to get to that we should be able
[28:33] to get to about sanctification before we
[28:35] break for lunch and then we'll come back
[28:37] and finish
[28:38] chapter 17 18 and all the way through
[28:40] there but chapter 12 we're going to the
[28:43] brothers have guided up here so so you
[28:45] won't have to flip through your Bible
[28:47] excuse me we're going to go through
[28:50] there you go for those of you that can't
[28:52] see well like me
[28:54] thank you brother Bob I think brother
[28:56] Bob's at the helm back there now isn't
[28:58] he yeah okay
[29:00] now and and brother Richard and all them
[29:03] man it's good to have a good team in it
[29:04] I mean it really is good to have a
[29:06] wonderful team
[29:07] now the Lord
[29:09] had said unto Abram
[29:12] now the word Abram means High father now
[29:15] brother Dale's already been through this
[29:16] but we got new people
[29:18] uh you know add to my bucket list is get
[29:22] everybody up to speed you know
[29:24] bring everybody in I don't want to leave
[29:26] anybody out
[29:27] now the Lord has sent unto Abram get me
[29:30] out of thy country in other words
[29:31] separate yourself
[29:34] Abram was what
[29:36] everyone was a gentile
[29:39] he wasn't a Jew
[29:41] he lived in her child days and he lived
[29:43] on his father remember the story is that
[29:45] his father was an idol maker
[29:47] that story goes but let's still worry
[29:49] about that
[29:51] but now look he was called out
[29:53] correct
[29:55] separate yourself get thee out of my
[29:58] country and from thy Kindred and from
[30:00] thy Father's House whoa
[30:02] separate from your natural family
[30:06] unto a land that I will show thee
[30:11] call now watch this verse 2 and I will
[30:16] make of the a great nation I will
[30:19] not Abram you're going to get so great
[30:20] you're going to do this yourself
[30:23] I will make a day a great nation and I
[30:26] will bless thee and make thy name great
[30:30] and thou shalt be a blessing now
[30:32] remember
[30:33] every son of the faith in the Final End
[30:37] you
[30:38] Shane daughter are going to go through
[30:41] this journey you're going to go through
[30:43] this exact Journey you're going to do
[30:44] just like Abram or or brother random was
[30:47] false and the Bible was false right
[30:49] all right so we start in justification
[30:51] so let everybody think justification and
[30:54] I will bless them that bless thee and
[30:55] curse him that curseth thee and in these
[30:58] shall all families of the earth be
[31:00] blessed right
[31:02] wow and Abrams away from what Abram did
[31:07] what God Said
[31:10] what a novel idea
[31:14] he just did what God told him to do amen
[31:17] right right and the Lord told Abram
[31:20] get thee out of this country separate
[31:23] yourself
[31:26] so Abram Departed
[31:28] as the Lord had spoken unto him and his
[31:31] mistake was
[31:33] he took a lot with him right
[31:35] but seeing justification you make a lot
[31:37] of mistakes
[31:39] I can tell you this because I went
[31:41] through it
[31:43] you want to be able to relate to that
[31:45] in justification you make a lot of
[31:47] mistakes why just because the unclean
[31:49] spirit's gone up you separated yourself
[31:50] for what you used to do right right
[31:53] right
[31:54] it's like brother Mark and I were
[31:56] talking last night but your old friends
[31:58] they're like
[31:59] a few more months
[32:01] just a few more months he'll be back
[32:04] he'll be back drinking his crown and
[32:05] ginger ale and he'll be back with a
[32:08] skull in his mouth he'll be yeah two
[32:09] three Ace probably went somewhere in a
[32:11] church and they got him all excited
[32:13] he'll be back you know Michael they see
[32:15] other people do that that's why they see
[32:17] their friends do that they see all the
[32:19] people of the world still going to
[32:21] church but smoking and drinking and
[32:22] doing the things of the world
[32:24] but I asked you guys one time and I
[32:25] didn't hear about the mark this but you
[32:27] know the same guy that held up the bear
[32:29] and said praise the Lord that I was
[32:30] saved that was kind of dumb
[32:33] the same guy
[32:36] the same guy he just they go to church
[32:38] and and everything's just hunky-dory
[32:41] but I I asked him I said well what'd you
[32:43] get saved from
[32:47] if saved means to be saved if you were
[32:50] in the water drowning and somebody
[32:51] reaches down and picked you up puts you
[32:53] in a boat they saved you from the
[32:55] situation that you were in
[32:57] right right man now far be it for you to
[32:59] jump back in the water
[33:01] but what did he do he saved you from one
[33:04] situation to another
[33:06] I said what do you save you from if
[33:09] you're still you smoked and drank and
[33:10] run around with women before
[33:13] right
[33:21] but watch Abram watch Abram's life now
[33:24] Abram I will make thee a great nation
[33:26] I will bless them that bless thee and
[33:28] curse him that curseth me remember those
[33:30] who he is truly Justified he is already
[33:32] glorified so if you're truly Justified
[33:34] today God is pleased with you not
[33:36] dwelling you yet
[33:39] but he's still pleased with you because
[33:41] he was pleased with Abram
[33:43] even Abram hi Father not father of many
[33:46] nations
[33:48] but see he knew Abraham was going to
[33:49] make it to the journey
[33:51] Abram was the one that didn't know he
[33:54] was going to make it to the journey
[33:55] that's right
[33:56] that's why we have to preach that's why
[33:58] brother Branham I pulled up quote
[33:59] yesterday where they said brother Brown
[34:00] well why do you even preach if this
[34:02] thing's you know signed sealed and
[34:04] delivered and God knows who will and who
[34:05] won't
[34:07] he says just like the story you cast in
[34:09] the net out in the water he said when
[34:10] you're casting that he said you get
[34:11] pollywogs you get snakes you get yes you
[34:14] get that he said but you get some fish
[34:16] but you don't know it yeah until you get
[34:19] the net in all right so that's what
[34:21] we're doing I just want to believe
[34:22] everybody say it or save a bowl right
[34:26] right
[34:28] and that was Abraham he thought he could
[34:31] help a lot
[34:34] right
[34:35] because he's still Abram Departed
[34:38] a lot went with it and Abram was 75
[34:42] years old when he Departed
[34:44] out of haran
[34:46] now haran
[34:49] is a place
[34:52] that you don't want to be in
[34:55] we'll get to that in just a second
[34:57] so Abram departed what'd he do he
[34:59] accepted
[35:00] God called him and he accepted right
[35:03] that's your journey when your journey
[35:05] starts God calls you you accept
[35:08] yes Lord I'm sorry for what I did
[35:12] please forgive me for what I did
[35:16] baby form justification then okay
[35:19] forgive me
[35:21] and what did Abram do Abram accepted and
[35:25] then he what he walked
[35:28] the word haran means contention
[35:33] so he left all that contention
[35:35] he departed out of haran he left all
[35:40] that contention and Abram took Sarah and
[35:43] his wife not Sarah Sarah
[35:46] right here's why
[35:50] and a lot his brother's son and all
[35:52] their substance that they had gathered
[35:53] and the souls that they had gotten in
[35:55] haran and they went forth the going for
[35:57] the land of Canaan
[35:59] now
[36:00] justification is a type of the Holy
[36:02] Ghost right
[36:04] you say what Canaan is the promised land
[36:06] what's he doing in a Promised Land if
[36:09] you're Justified today you're heading to
[36:11] the promised land
[36:13] if you're truly Justified you're in the
[36:16] promised land you're right because if
[36:18] you're under
[36:27] God was pleased with Luther's
[36:30] justification
[36:31] right because that was the Holy Ghost
[36:33] for the time
[36:34] he's pleased with your justification if
[36:36] you're just Justified today if you just
[36:38] walked in the door and said God forgive
[36:40] me of my sins I am going to follow you
[36:45] I'm going to depart from all this
[36:47] contention
[36:49] I ain't leaving this place and I'm going
[36:51] if somebody pulled me up out of the boat
[36:53] I'm not gonna get back in the water
[36:55] now some do
[36:57] it's nice right that's the problem with
[37:00] people seeing they see somebody come to
[37:01] church several months later they kind of
[37:04] wander back into what they were doing
[37:06] before you know what
[37:07] I believe their stands were forgiven but
[37:09] they stopped
[37:12] stopped
[37:14] right Abram kept moving at least he went
[37:16] through different places and he and
[37:19] justification is kind of like
[37:21] it's kind of like trying something new
[37:23] because you're not used to it
[37:26] you're used to going in a store and
[37:28] pulling up a pack of beer and cigarettes
[37:30] or whatever and laying it on the counter
[37:32] and and doing like Mark said and you
[37:34] know your church was on Sunday watching
[37:36] football
[37:38] but man all that changed
[37:41] what you come out of that
[37:44] we come out of that we don't watch
[37:46] football on Sundays no more and not go
[37:48] to church
[37:50] right
[37:53] so something had to change
[37:56] Abram moved away from where he was but
[37:59] he went into the land of Canaan the
[38:02] promised land but remember he didn't
[38:04] stay in there
[38:06] he went away
[38:08] in and out
[38:10] justification is in and out in and out
[38:13] remember the outer Court the outer Court
[38:15] was all the way
[38:17] the doors were open and anybody can they
[38:19] call it actually the court of the
[38:20] Gentiles because even the Gentiles could
[38:21] walk in and out of that Court
[38:24] but once you get into the second chord
[38:27] can't do that
[38:30] only the Sanctified go to the second
[38:33] level
[38:34] so justification even brother Brandon
[38:36] you'll hear him on arabell he said
[38:37] justification he said if it's cloudy
[38:39] you're going to get rained on them
[38:41] but Sunny you're gonna get hot because
[38:43] there's no nothing to protect you you
[38:45] can go in and out but once you get into
[38:47] that next Bale there's a cover
[38:50] there's something to protect you amen
[38:52] okay now we're going to watch that with
[38:53] Abraham or April sorry if I say Abraham
[38:56] Mr slip of my tongue okay because he is
[38:58] now Abram he is not Abraham all right
[39:01] it's not Abraham you are not a son and
[39:03] daughter of God until you're born again
[39:05] you're going to get a name change
[39:08] so you're Abram
[39:10] you have troubles and struggles you're
[39:12] moving your your worrying you're taking
[39:15] baggage with you
[39:18] lot
[39:21] all right everybody okay
[39:24] all right now look and Abram verse six
[39:27] that Abram passed through the land unto
[39:29] the place
[39:30] oh them
[39:32] which means the back or shoulders of God
[39:35] pretty good place to be because you know
[39:38] what
[39:38] in justification
[39:42] you don't have a foundation
[39:44] so you need God
[39:46] that's why when you start walking in
[39:48] your faith you need to be like that
[39:50] ember you don't need to be separated
[39:54] you say oh brother you're just too
[39:56] legalistic the Bible I think about this
[39:58] other day and I read it in Romans the
[40:01] Bible says that I just maybe people
[40:03] don't believe like I believe maybe
[40:05] people don't believe this is the end
[40:06] time
[40:07] because the Bible says for Satan not the
[40:10] assembling yourself together and much
[40:12] more
[40:13] and much more
[40:15] and much more
[40:17] as the day approaches
[40:20] separate yourself and you do just like
[40:22] lot did because remember we're going to
[40:25] see lots separated himself from Abraham
[40:27] from Abram and he didn't do very well
[40:30] sure God blessed him and give him
[40:32] Earthly things
[40:35] look where he wound up you wind up in
[40:37] sin and Sodom
[40:39] right right
[40:41] they made me scream like this all right
[40:44] it just breaks my heart you know
[40:47] much more as a day approaches aren't we
[40:50] approaching the day yes amen
[40:54] we need each other people
[40:58] and to the plane of Mora and the
[41:00] Canaanites was then in the land and the
[41:03] Lord appeared
[41:04] under Abram
[41:06] see God's going to appear to you
[41:09] how have you been appear to you he may
[41:10] appear to you in a physical form he may
[41:12] appear to you in a dream or a vision he
[41:16] may appear to you in many forms but
[41:17] that's definitely one way he's going to
[41:19] appear to you and that's in the word
[41:20] that's right amen he's going to appear
[41:22] to you in the word because the word is
[41:24] the only place God is that's right all
[41:26] right
[41:27] now look what happened to Abram
[41:30] and April passed through the land into
[41:32] the place of chicken
[41:34] okay so I already read that story and
[41:36] the Lord appeared unto Abram and said
[41:38] unto thy seed will I give
[41:41] this land
[41:45] and they're building him altering to the
[41:47] Lord who appeared unto him and he
[41:49] removed from this into a mountain on the
[41:52] east of Bethel
[41:53] here we go what is Bethel Bethel means
[41:57] ah y'all can quote it by memory the
[42:00] house I'm going
[42:01] the house of God's bread
[42:04] to be specific the word Bethel means so
[42:07] see Abram starts his journey
[42:10] what's the first thing Robbie and Ruth
[42:12] started doing
[42:15] because you need to draw strength
[42:17] we know he's El Shady eye we know he's
[42:19] the breasted one but he only appears as
[42:22] the breasted one when Abram is beginning
[42:24] in his walk as he's in the new birth
[42:26] right but remember that Melchizedek
[42:29] Melchizedek is high priest
[42:34] look up Highbury we don't have time
[42:39] but Melchizedek Matt Abram
[42:42] and giving communion in his walk of
[42:45] justification
[42:48] if you're truly Justified
[42:52] you're on your way
[42:54] to being glorified
[42:56] if you're truly Justified the Bible says
[42:58] you're already glorified
[43:00] you just don't know yet
[43:02] but when are we going to realize
[43:05] they were there listening he removed
[43:07] from this into a mountain on the east of
[43:09] Bethel and pitched his tent having
[43:11] Bethel on the west
[43:13] and high on the east
[43:15] and they're building an open to the Lord
[43:17] and called upon the name of the Lord and
[43:19] Abram journeyed
[43:23] going where
[43:26] um
[43:28] Abram was moving
[43:31] God is always moving
[43:35] he never sits still
[43:38] God is always moving so Abram journeyed
[43:42] going on still toward the South
[43:45] and there was a famine in the land that
[43:47] Abram went down into Egypt
[43:51] Egypt is a type of what the world
[43:54] because you're still in justification
[43:55] you've still got the world
[43:58] has got that attachment
[44:01] remember justification is the man picks
[44:04] up the dirty jar
[44:07] the jar is still dirty right but at
[44:10] least the man picked it up from the
[44:12] situation that it was in
[44:14] called saves
[44:15] he picks the jar up and he's got it in
[44:17] his hand
[44:19] right
[44:20] still dirty on the inside and the
[44:22] outside right nothing has changed except
[44:25] the position that it was in man
[44:29] but see that man didn't just pick
[44:32] that man just didn't pick that jar up to
[44:34] throw it away
[44:35] that man picked that jar up to use it
[44:39] even in justification he had a thought
[44:41] in his mind he had an attribute
[44:44] but that jar is going to be used for
[44:46] something right I'm going to use this
[44:48] I'm not going to just chunk it out I'm
[44:50] gonna use it why did he pick it out for
[44:52] if he wasn't going to use it God Don't
[44:54] Make Mistakes
[44:57] oh this may be simple but I sure wasn't
[45:07] it came to pass when he was come near to
[45:09] enter into Egypt that he sent unto Sarah
[45:11] his wife behold now I know that thou art
[45:13] a fair woman to look upon
[45:15] now we know what happened we don't have
[45:17] to read this whole thing but I want you
[45:19] to remember one thing
[45:22] this is Abram
[45:25] and Sarah
[45:28] not Abraham and Sarah
[45:30] this is Abram and Sarah in justification
[45:35] in a title
[45:38] because he goes down to Egypt
[45:42] meets pharaoh
[45:45] Pharaoh wants to manage his wife in
[45:48] other words okay it's fair to look punks
[45:50] you're still pretty old she's about 60
[45:51] something
[45:53] but listen
[45:55] we're going to see that Abraham and
[45:58] Sarah
[45:59] did this later
[46:03] but I want you to watch the difference
[46:05] in justification
[46:07] God
[46:12] what
[46:14] I just saw this this morning
[46:17] the Lord plagued Pharaoh in his house
[46:19] with great plagues because of Sarah
[46:21] Sarah Abram's wife
[46:24] and Pharaoh called Abram and said what
[46:26] is this the thou has done to me why not
[46:28] thou not tell me about she was thy wife
[46:30] verse 19 if you want to skip on through
[46:32] that brother
[46:33] when I say is thou she is my sister
[46:36] he still is you're still deceptible to
[46:39] some lying
[46:40] when you're Justified to save your
[46:42] height that's what Abram did
[46:45] but now watch and Pharaoh commanded his
[46:47] people concerning him and they sent him
[46:48] away and his wife and all that he had
[46:53] now watch when Abraham and Sarah does
[46:56] this same situation
[46:58] God comes on the scene
[47:00] instead of bimlet you got a problem
[47:04] and this man is going to have to pray
[47:05] for you to restore your kingdom
[47:08] now brother dating in justification he
[47:10] didn't do that
[47:13] next don't get that
[47:15] Russian Abram was in
[47:18] the position Abram was in was
[47:21] here in justification God was looking
[47:24] after him but God didn't come on the
[47:25] scene and say hey
[47:27] you touch that woman
[47:29] everything's gone because he was not
[47:31] Abraham and Sarah
[47:34] listen God's Gonna respect your person
[47:36] but I'm gonna promise you one thing if
[47:38] you're his child he treats you different
[47:42] amen amen now come on people he's a
[47:45] father he treats you different
[47:48] be protected Abram and Sarai to a degree
[47:52] because Pharaoh said hey I found this
[47:54] out get out of here
[47:56] and take everything with you that's
[47:58] right
[47:59] but buddy he told a biblings he said if
[48:01] you touch that woman you're a dead man
[48:03] he didn't say that in justification
[48:05] right
[48:07] watch how God
[48:09] the whole thing I want you to watch is
[48:11] how Abram and God and watch how they
[48:13] come closer yeah
[48:16] because it's a journey I know God but
[48:18] see God's still moving God's one moving
[48:20] God's moving
[48:22] got some stainless steel
[48:24] watch them come closer and closer
[48:27] if you don't see that in your journey
[48:28] then God's still here and you're still
[48:29] here
[48:31] and Pharrell commanded his people
[48:33] concerning they sent him away in his
[48:35] wife and all that he had Pharaoh they
[48:37] won't have nothing to do with this guy
[48:41] in other words he took all the blessing
[48:42] good now Abram verse 13.
[48:45] went out of Egypt
[48:48] he and his wife and all that he had and
[48:51] a lot with him here he goes again with a
[48:53] lot
[48:55] looking with him and he went on his
[48:57] journey from the south even to Bethel
[48:58] now he goes back to church again
[49:00] until the place where his tent had been
[49:02] at the beginning
[49:08] go to church
[49:11] justification you've heard me many times
[49:13] even even when you were born again when
[49:15] you're you babe in Christ you're a
[49:18] legalist
[49:20] right one more time you were a legalist
[49:24] right right man it's all news and dogs
[49:28] her dress is a little
[49:31] well she might not have been here for
[49:33] two weeks
[49:34] knew in the message
[49:36] you know you don't have a lot of Grace
[49:38] but you know what
[49:39] as you progress you get a lot more grace
[49:43] all right
[49:45] now
[49:47] watch
[49:49] billing chapter 13. We're not gonna go
[49:51] to Hebrews just a second if you don't
[49:53] mind
[49:54] we'll wait I forgot to read that one
[49:57] but look when God made a promise when he
[50:00] made that promise in Hebrews he could
[50:01] swear by no other so what'd he say I
[50:03] will I will I will remember this is an
[50:06] unconditional Covenant
[50:09] I will Abram
[50:11] Adam if you do this and don't do this
[50:13] see what I'm talking about
[50:15] justification is more like you do this
[50:17] you you're doing some don'ts
[50:20] now I'm not saying that you live any way
[50:21] you want to right
[50:23] if you do then
[50:25] you don't have God that's right you not
[50:27] only journey toward God that's right man
[50:29] you're not going to Bethel you're not
[50:31] going to Canyon you journey in like lot
[50:34] you're going towards China all right and
[50:36] that place got burned up
[50:38] right all right
[50:41] let's catch back up
[50:43] only at verse one and Abram went out of
[50:46] Egypt he and his wife
[50:47] and all that he had and locked with him
[50:49] into the South and Abram was very rich
[50:51] in cattle and silver and gold see God's
[50:53] still going to bless you in
[50:54] justification
[50:56] because true justification let me say
[50:58] that one more time God is pleased
[51:00] to walk with you in justification all
[51:03] the mistakes you make and all the
[51:05] blunders and all the the things that you
[51:07] do that that are not right
[51:11] he knows that we're human because he was
[51:14] a human one time the Bible said he
[51:17] became perfect and learned by the things
[51:19] he suffered right all right and being
[51:22] made perfect you understand yes all
[51:24] right now
[51:25] they went on his journey verse three
[51:28] he went on his journeys from the south
[51:30] even to Bethel until the place where his
[51:32] tent had been at the beginning between
[51:34] Bethel and high until the place of the
[51:36] altar which he had made there at first
[51:38] and there Abram called on the name of
[51:41] the Lord now in justification what
[51:45] becomes evident in justification like
[51:47] brother Mark and I were talking have you
[51:49] noticed
[51:50] have you noticed all these new churches
[51:55] they're called worship sinners
[51:59] right yep that's right who's the worship
[52:02] angel
[52:03] that damn off
[52:06] that's good brother amen
[52:10] we're not Baptist anymore
[52:12] had a friend of mine who still works at
[52:13] Victory food good Christian boy as far
[52:16] as he knows he lived the best he can but
[52:19] he came up to me one day and told me he
[52:21] said we worship so long this is the
[52:23] Baptist
[52:24] we worship so long the preacher didn't
[52:26] even get to preach now have you ever
[52:27] heard that before
[52:29] we thought the Pentecostals only did
[52:31] that now the Baptists are doing it
[52:34] but I was telling Brother Martin he said
[52:36] yeah you're right you look it's not the
[52:38] First Baptist Church in gilsville
[52:40] anymore right it's the Worship Center
[52:44] yields The Worship Center or what
[52:46] Gainesville Worship Center all these
[52:48] worship centers and and I like this one
[52:50] new age
[52:53] seen that one new age
[52:55] you see what Satan's doing yeah
[52:58] he's doing away with names
[53:00] he's doing away with any kind of name he
[53:03] wants you to worship Satan with love for
[53:05] you to just worship
[53:06] there's nothing wrong with worship right
[53:08] right okay
[53:10] but if that's all you do
[53:13] you're out that's right and that's all
[53:15] they do they just worship they know to
[53:17] worship and cry and and you know mother
[53:19] made it so so maybe I made it or hoped
[53:22] to but but now watch Abram Abram called
[53:25] on the name of the Lord
[53:28] justification we need to realize there's
[53:31] a name
[53:32] like remember the Marvel the reason I'm
[53:34] saying this he and I spent two hours
[53:36] going to going to listen to Dad last
[53:38] night and two hours back home so we had
[53:39] a good four hour conversation with each
[53:41] other that we usually hadn't got hadn't
[53:43] done in a long time so thank God for
[53:46] that right a lot of you missed out
[53:48] brother Mark said if we had a band for a
[53:49] week and a talk like this I said yeah I
[53:51] know
[53:54] especially the ones that we're going
[53:55] with us foreign
[54:01] but we do win listen what do they say
[54:04] now they say and and Philip's the same
[54:07] way that the brother the the Victor
[54:09] Foods he said God
[54:11] God
[54:12] I hardly ever say Jesus that's right
[54:15] hardly ever say Jesus Christ
[54:18] God is going to do God
[54:20] this could be your God
[54:22] nobody's got a name yes his name's Lord
[54:26] Jesus Christ amen and they don't like
[54:29] that name
[54:30] or they'd be baptized in it
[54:33] Paul's not a name son is not a name Holy
[54:36] Ghost is not a name worship sin is not a
[54:39] name
[54:41] amen that's right we got to be
[54:44] identified
[54:45] all that we do in word indeed doing the
[54:47] name of Jesus Christ they don't do that
[54:50] they'll say in God's name
[54:52] they won't call his name or they'll say
[54:54] for Christ's sake against that they
[54:56] don't pray for Christ's sake
[55:00] I mean you get mad at somebody and you
[55:02] say that Christ's sake man quit doing
[55:03] that
[55:05] you know the world does that we should
[55:07] do that I'm sorry I shouldn't have done
[55:08] that but you know what they're afraid of
[55:10] that name but Abram's not Abram called
[55:13] on the name of the Lord
[55:16] now he didn't say Lord Jesus Christ he
[55:18] didn't know that
[55:20] but you do
[55:22] you do
[55:23] you know
[55:25] you knew when you become Justified and
[55:27] you at least come to this church you
[55:29] knew there was a name you had to come
[55:31] under
[55:32] to be identified with God
[55:35] right because God's name is the Lord
[55:37] Jesus Christ amen so in justification
[55:40] watch how God is coming closer he's
[55:42] revealing his name
[55:45] I know some of you had problems with
[55:46] that
[55:47] some of you didn't
[55:51] but you had to come to a realization
[55:52] that the only way to move with God is to
[55:55] be baptized in that name Amen to be
[55:58] identified you know what I'm Adele
[56:01] I'm a son I'm Grandpa I'm pawpaw
[56:06] but I got a name
[56:08] and that anybody can be a popo
[56:13] it might be a daddy
[56:14] there's only one same way down the
[56:16] second that identifies everything toward
[56:18] me right so that's the same way with the
[56:21] Lord Jesus Christ that identifies that's
[56:22] why the world is pushing that name out
[56:25] you know what they say well yeah we
[56:26] believe in that name but they can't
[56:28] stand it
[56:29] right
[56:31] that's why
[56:32] brother Bram said father son Holy Ghost
[56:34] baptism come from the pits of hell
[56:36] because Satan slipped that in on the
[56:37] people right
[56:39] and had them baptized in that title
[56:43] to do away with the name
[56:45] Satan wants to do away with that and he
[56:47] hates that name
[56:50] he hates the name Jesus Christ right
[56:54] and he's my Lord
[56:56] but Abram had a revelation in verse 4.
[56:59] he called on the name of the Lord
[57:02] and a lot also which went with Abram had
[57:04] flocks and hurt intense so you know God
[57:06] blessed a blessed lot too and the lamb
[57:09] was not able to Bear them God blessed
[57:11] them so much to him man that was eating
[57:13] all the grass right and eating all the
[57:15] leaves off the trees
[57:20] and the lamb was not able to Bear them
[57:21] the team might dwell together for their
[57:23] substance was great so they could not
[57:26] dwell together and there was a Strife
[57:28] now look there wasn't a strike between
[57:29] Abram and lot
[57:31] it was a strike between Abram's church
[57:33] members and lots church members
[57:36] that's right herdsman right
[57:39] between the herdmen of Evans cattle and
[57:42] Herdman locks cattle and the Canaanites
[57:45] and the purgicide dwelled in in the land
[57:47] in other words the land was getting kind
[57:49] of full
[57:50] and everyone said a lot let there be no
[57:52] Strife I pray thee between me and me and
[57:54] between my herdmen and I heard me before
[57:56] we be brethren
[57:58] we can learn a lot right there
[58:01] it's not the whole land before they
[58:03] separate thyself I pray thee from me is
[58:07] thou will take a left hand and I will go
[58:08] to the right now what did he do he gave
[58:10] light
[58:11] he gave a lot
[58:14] the option
[58:16] Abram didn't look over here because you
[58:18] know what
[58:20] what did God promise Abram
[58:23] Abram didn't forget what God Said
[58:26] he said I'm gonna give you part of the
[58:28] Lamb right remember back I will I will
[58:31] bless thee multiply them give you
[58:33] everything right
[58:35] all the families in heaven
[58:43] and I will go to the way and lot lifted
[58:46] up his eyes and I'm sure he probably
[58:47] beheld the planes of Jordan now what is
[58:49] that it was watered it was probably
[58:51] greener than the rest
[58:53] it's a lot probably not being a
[58:57] believer
[58:58] to a degree that that burn was
[59:02] that it was well watered everywhere
[59:03] before the Lord destroyed Sodom and
[59:05] Gomorrah even as the garden of the Lord
[59:06] in other words the Garden of Eden
[59:08] this was like going to beating and this
[59:10] didn't
[59:13] like the land of Egypt as thou cometh
[59:15] into the door they light chose him all
[59:17] the plains of Jordan now listen Abram
[59:20] didn't jump up and down and scream why'd
[59:22] you do that
[59:23] oh look
[59:25] they separated himself one from the
[59:27] other right Abram dwelled in the land of
[59:29] Canaan that's where he was supposed to
[59:30] be in the first place
[59:32] that was the Promised Land
[59:35] and lot dwelled in the cities of the
[59:37] plain but his problem was
[59:39] his attitude was toward the world
[59:43] he pitched his tent towards Sodom
[59:46] what'd he do if he looked he saw son
[59:50] all right but the man of thought were
[59:52] Wicked in Sinners before the Lord
[59:53] exceedingly and the Lord said unto Abram
[59:56] after that lot was separated
[1:00:01] God began to talk
[1:00:03] thank you
[1:00:05] Ryan
[1:00:07] you had one little thing you got to get
[1:00:09] out every one of us today
[1:00:11] even I don't care if you follow the Holy
[1:00:13] Ghost they steal remember justification
[1:00:15] goes higher and higher there's things
[1:00:17] that we got attached to us that we got
[1:00:19] to separate from
[1:00:21] all of us
[1:00:23] after that lot was separated from him
[1:00:25] lift up thine eyes and look from the
[1:00:28] place where thou art
[1:00:30] now look
[1:00:32] took a certain area right right over
[1:00:35] here yes
[1:00:39] Abram went over here now watch what God
[1:00:41] he's promised Abel
[1:00:45] look from the place where thou art
[1:00:47] northward
[1:00:49] Southward
[1:00:51] Eastward
[1:00:52] and westward in other words even right
[1:00:55] over there where lot was
[1:00:57] for all the land which thou seeest could
[1:00:59] thee will I give it and to thy seed
[1:01:02] forever
[1:01:04] ask God's children God's promises are
[1:01:07] true people there's nothing in this
[1:01:09] world there's no drug there's no there's
[1:01:11] no picture there's no
[1:01:14] um ball team there's no great big deer
[1:01:16] there's no nothing
[1:01:20] that'll give you this
[1:01:23] God said I'll give my children
[1:01:27] looks right here
[1:01:29] nobody else
[1:01:30] this right here and I will make thy seed
[1:01:34] as the Dutch of the earth so that the
[1:01:35] man can number the dust of the earth and
[1:01:37] shall not see it also be numbered arise
[1:01:40] walk through the land and the length of
[1:01:42] it
[1:01:43] and the breath of it for I will give it
[1:01:46] unto thee Brothers said Footprints means
[1:01:48] possession right everywhere you walk
[1:01:52] everywhere you walk church we are what
[1:01:55] we are given
[1:01:57] to be possessors
[1:01:59] of this Earth that's right
[1:02:01] I thought we were going to come back as
[1:02:03] kings and preach and Rule and Reign Over
[1:02:04] the all right
[1:02:06] all right
[1:02:09] then Abram removed his tent
[1:02:12] and came and dwelled in the planes of
[1:02:13] mammary which is in Hebron
[1:02:16] and Hebron means the seed of Association
[1:02:18] so he's bringing everything together and
[1:02:20] built there and altering to the Lord
[1:02:21] look at Abram watch him he's making
[1:02:24] sacrifices
[1:02:25] in justification you say well no
[1:02:27] sanctification is a in the blood I
[1:02:29] know that
[1:02:30] but don't you make don't you make
[1:02:32] sacrifices in justification
[1:02:35] you sacrifice there's a lot of things we
[1:02:38] sacrifice
[1:02:39] come on people when sometimes we say
[1:02:42] this is justification and we put it in a
[1:02:43] block over here and then we'll say well
[1:02:45] this is sanctification and we put it
[1:02:46] right here no it's all mixed together
[1:02:48] right all these all these is not there's
[1:02:51] not a line for virtue and then when you
[1:02:53] fill that up like a gas tank
[1:02:55] you go to knowledge that don't happen
[1:02:57] right and God it's a it's a blowing and
[1:03:00] a moving
[1:03:01] all right now who are we at Dentistry 14
[1:03:08] yes it's 14. everybody okay I'm gonna
[1:03:11] try to get to a spot here we've got to
[1:03:13] get to a spot here for this afternoon
[1:03:16] now what happens
[1:03:18] we're not going to read all that but
[1:03:20] what has happened
[1:03:21] go to verse 12.
[1:03:24] now what happened was I love this thing
[1:03:28] what happened was you know the story
[1:03:31] Lots going down towards Sodom
[1:03:34] Abrams in his journey and he hears that
[1:03:38] some Kings had got together some devils
[1:03:40] that got together and took his brother
[1:03:42] off
[1:03:43] right some devils
[1:03:46] and come and got his brother and took
[1:03:48] his brother
[1:03:50] and all them
[1:03:51] all right because that's what comes back
[1:03:54] so what does Abram do Abram doesn't go
[1:03:57] to another denomination
[1:04:01] and give a group of people to fight
[1:04:05] he gets his whole family right remember
[1:04:07] what does it say come back just roll it
[1:04:10] back just a little bit
[1:04:13] because I believe Abram said
[1:04:18] no verse 14.
[1:04:20] he armed
[1:04:23] 318 train servants born in his own house
[1:04:29] he didn't go out and look for somebody
[1:04:33] we fight our battles right here
[1:04:42] justification
[1:04:44] is really a wonderful thing
[1:04:46] but you don't want to stay there that's
[1:04:48] the problem you don't want to just get
[1:04:50] Justified
[1:04:52] you want to go on to sanctification
[1:04:54] because what did Abram do Abram didn't
[1:04:55] stop
[1:04:57] Abram and type he kept going on to a
[1:05:00] higher level all right but when he had
[1:05:03] heard that his brother was in trouble
[1:05:06] he took verse 14 when Abram heard that
[1:05:09] his brother was taken captive he armed
[1:05:11] his train service born in his own house
[1:05:13] 318 and pursued them unto Dan and he
[1:05:16] divided himself against them he and his
[1:05:18] servants by night and smote them pursued
[1:05:21] them unto hobos which is on the left
[1:05:23] side of Damascus and he brought back all
[1:05:26] the goods
[1:05:30] all the good
[1:05:33] and also browned Again by his brother a
[1:05:35] lot and his goods and the women also and
[1:05:38] the people
[1:05:39] now the king of Sodom verse 17 went out
[1:05:41] to meet him after his return from the
[1:05:43] slaughter of this king of cheddar or
[1:05:46] lamb the king of the kings that were
[1:05:49] with him at the valley of Shiva which is
[1:05:52] the Kingsdale
[1:05:54] and Melchizedek now here we see
[1:05:56] Melchizedek
[1:05:58] appear in verse
[1:06:00] 18. all right
[1:06:02] so now
[1:06:06] let's go to the second quote
[1:06:13] goal number two Melchizedek the great
[1:06:15] Prince
[1:06:17] it'll take a second then get it up there
[1:06:20] okay
[1:06:21] all right notice when he had returned
[1:06:25] Melchizedek
[1:06:27] met him
[1:06:28] who was this Melchizedek and notice the
[1:06:31] first thing now my candidate did not
[1:06:32] offer him any money
[1:06:35] God don't want your money right
[1:06:38] I didn't offer money
[1:06:40] Melchizedek only offered in Bread and
[1:06:42] Wine
[1:06:43] now candidate was Priest of the most
[1:06:45] high the king of Jerusalem
[1:06:48] that was then called Salem here's a
[1:06:50] crudence concordance that's what he had
[1:06:52] I thought of it with a question there
[1:06:53] would be a question afterwards I can
[1:06:54] prove it that Jerusalem was first Salem
[1:06:57] j-e-r-u-s-l-e-m-c Salem Jerusalem see it
[1:07:00] was first called Hiram Jerusalem that's
[1:07:03] right
[1:07:05] which once was in Gentile possession oh
[1:07:07] I hope you get this now Jerusalem was
[1:07:09] first in Gentile possession and the king
[1:07:10] of Jerusalem or Salem which was me in
[1:07:12] the king of Peace king of righteousness
[1:07:14] made Abraham as a return and give him
[1:07:16] the communion bread and wine thousands
[1:07:18] of years or hundreds of years before
[1:07:19] Brandon wine was ever an ordinance in
[1:07:21] the church and he was the king of
[1:07:24] Jerusalem
[1:07:25] amen all right now let's go to Hebrews
[1:07:29] seven because this is what happened I'm
[1:07:31] going to read the rest of this and put
[1:07:33] up Hebrews 7. got it all right
[1:07:36] now I'm reading Genesis
[1:07:39] 14 18. and Melchizedek king of Salem
[1:07:41] brought forth Bread and Wine and he was
[1:07:43] the priest of the most high God and he
[1:07:46] blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of
[1:07:48] the most high god possessor of Heaven
[1:07:49] and Earth this isn't justification
[1:07:53] and blessed be the most high God which
[1:07:56] have delivered thine enemy into thy
[1:07:57] hands and he gave him pies
[1:07:59] of all now we're going to spend a lot of
[1:08:01] time on ties but Hebrews 7 says for this
[1:08:04] Melchizedek king of Salem Priests of the
[1:08:06] most high God who met Abraham returning
[1:08:08] from the slaughter of the Kings and
[1:08:10] blessed him to whom also Abram give a
[1:08:12] tenth part of all first being by
[1:08:14] interpretation king of righteousness and
[1:08:16] after that king of Salem which is king
[1:08:18] of peace
[1:08:20] and remember he's King of Kings
[1:08:23] to you and I without father without
[1:08:26] mother without dissent having neither
[1:08:27] beginning of days nor ending of life but
[1:08:29] made life into the Son of God abideth a
[1:08:32] priest continually now consider how
[1:08:34] great this man was unto whom even the
[1:08:36] painter Abraham give the tense
[1:08:40] I'll be spoil and that's where we get
[1:08:43] our tithing and it's tithing on your
[1:08:46] increase
[1:08:48] gift tithing the tenth of the spoil
[1:08:51] all right
[1:08:52] so maybe you tie them the growth some of
[1:08:55] your tiles on the net
[1:08:57] you tired on the net you get taxes back
[1:09:00] you got to pay tithe on it but you pay
[1:09:01] on the growth you get your taxes back
[1:09:03] you've already paid tithe on it all
[1:09:05] right
[1:09:05] but without paying tight look what Abram
[1:09:07] done in justification this is my point
[1:09:10] I'm going to make another point about
[1:09:12] timing
[1:09:13] and justification Abram
[1:09:16] pay tithe
[1:09:18] justification
[1:09:20] Abram
[1:09:21] at times
[1:09:23] now it's a new birth he didn't come to
[1:09:25] this great revelation after God filled
[1:09:27] him with the Holy Ghost no
[1:09:29] Abram paid tithes
[1:09:32] to Melchizedek you don't pay tithe at
[1:09:34] the brother Dale right
[1:09:37] you don't pay tithes to a church that's
[1:09:40] right that's right he paid tithes to
[1:09:43] almighty God
[1:09:45] Melchizedek
[1:09:46] it's God right
[1:09:49] so he paid tithe to Melchizedek you pay
[1:09:52] your time if you don't pay your pies
[1:09:53] you're not robbing brother Dale you're
[1:09:55] not robbing the church you sure they're
[1:09:56] not robbing me you're Robin none but
[1:10:01] you're robbing yourself
[1:10:04] of a blessing
[1:10:07] I've told you many times before when I
[1:10:09] when I owned when we had our business
[1:10:11] there in in Gainesville and I didn't
[1:10:14] come back to the Lord until 1997 in
[1:10:16] December and then we grew from 1993 when
[1:10:20] we bought the business until 1998 we
[1:10:22] grew a million dollars a year We Grew
[1:10:25] From three million three and a half
[1:10:26] million to eight and a half million
[1:10:27] dollars
[1:10:29] and I was dummy
[1:10:31] I wouldn't have the Lord
[1:10:33] that was just in my mentality in my
[1:10:36] brain
[1:10:36] me and my partner
[1:10:39] my brother Danny we got to a point where
[1:10:40] we were making our money
[1:10:44] to a 1998 I turned all that over to God
[1:10:47] you know the story most of you do
[1:10:49] I gave it all to God I said God I had
[1:10:52] dated to come up and pray
[1:10:54] and and my partner we're the center
[1:10:57] I didn't care what he did I was gonna
[1:10:58] pay times on what I made right right so
[1:11:02] I started doing that
[1:11:04] and this is a testimony to God because
[1:11:06] we didn't do nothing actually we got rid
[1:11:08] of a million and a half dollars worth of
[1:11:10] business that year the next year and
[1:11:11] made more money in one year than we did
[1:11:13] five years in a row
[1:11:16] we made more money in one year than we
[1:11:18] did in five years and I paid tithe off
[1:11:20] of that
[1:11:22] every bit that we made
[1:11:24] and God blessed us ever since until I
[1:11:26] sold it and they're still doing good
[1:11:29] but see you're robbing yourself of a
[1:11:30] blessing
[1:11:32] because he said he would pour out the
[1:11:34] windows of heaven and Malachi
[1:11:36] but if Abram paid tithes and
[1:11:39] justification
[1:11:40] see if you don't pay tithe then you
[1:11:41] don't even Justified
[1:11:46] sorry I didn't say that God did
[1:11:50] Abram had enough sense to say hey
[1:11:53] now that's what you do really look I
[1:11:55] don't want to be I don't want to be mean
[1:11:58] but that's what Abram said am I said God
[1:12:00] you've given me all this
[1:12:02] you've given me this
[1:12:05] just in a Justified condition I'm still
[1:12:08] running around the country and I can't
[1:12:10] find that City remember everyone was
[1:12:11] looking for a city
[1:12:13] whose Builder maker was God because God
[1:12:15] promised him I will give you all these
[1:12:17] things
[1:12:19] not only stories here that you can tell
[1:12:21] of how God's blessed you since you
[1:12:23] started paying time but my Heavens if
[1:12:25] Abram was able and Abram was not a
[1:12:28] born-again Believer even when we type
[1:12:30] him in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:32] he's just I and we're going to get into
[1:12:35] this Abram was not a son of God
[1:12:41] the Bible says it's a friend of God
[1:12:44] we'll get to that tonight
[1:12:47] he was not the Son of God not like you
[1:12:49] and I right right he was not
[1:12:52] and he paid tithes
[1:12:54] like I said I don't we don't need your
[1:12:56] money
[1:12:57] but God said if you'll pay it
[1:13:02] he proved that time and time again
[1:13:04] somebody said brother dick you know
[1:13:06] somebody said well I can't afford to pay
[1:13:08] tithes he says I can't afford not to
[1:13:10] amen I guess we're not to
[1:13:14] I'm busy blessed in this room by paying
[1:13:17] time
[1:13:18] 99 percent
[1:13:21] if he hadn't blessed you then you're not
[1:13:23] playing time
[1:13:28] different paid ties
[1:13:30] in his journey because one thing he
[1:13:33] realized
[1:13:34] he'd come from somewhere
[1:13:36] that he was down in this earth child
[1:13:39] beef he would he was miserable
[1:13:41] his daddy was making a false god
[1:13:45] and some body
[1:13:47] spoke to this man
[1:13:49] and said if you'll start a journey with
[1:13:51] me I bless you
[1:13:54] think about that
[1:13:56] and I saw him sister that's all he done
[1:13:58] he said if you'll start a journey with
[1:14:00] me God bless you
[1:14:02] and Abram come to realize when he met
[1:14:04] that man face to face he said God
[1:14:07] I don't want all this
[1:14:09] I don't want all this and God said just
[1:14:12] give me you know he's doing 10 more than
[1:14:13] we do it 90.
[1:14:15] that's right
[1:14:17] what what an he wanna eat eat anonymous
[1:14:22] that's hard to say I'm not gonna say it
[1:14:24] again
[1:14:28] Economist I'll say it again but he's
[1:14:30] great I mean he's good with ten percent
[1:14:32] what we can do with 90. he runs his
[1:14:34] whole economy not because of gold not
[1:14:37] because of money market not because of
[1:14:39] banks not because of foreclosures and
[1:14:42] all this stuff he's not worried about
[1:14:43] the stock market
[1:14:45] he takes 10 and says hey I'm going to
[1:14:48] even bless you
[1:14:49] with this ten percent because that's
[1:14:52] what he does so that you know he did
[1:14:53] with the Levi's that's where the Levi's
[1:14:55] got ten percent and they run their
[1:14:57] economy with that so just to give it
[1:14:59] that was just something to throw in
[1:15:00] there because I had a circle and said
[1:15:02] entirely on the increase
[1:15:04] but now watch
[1:15:06] in Hebrews 7
[1:15:08] . let's go back to that again Hebrews 7.
[1:15:10] let's look at something real quick then
[1:15:11] we'll start in sanctification for a
[1:15:13] little while and we'll finish up maybe
[1:15:15] tonight or this afternoon
[1:15:17] put Hebrews 7 back up there
[1:15:21] all right now look
[1:15:22] one important thing
[1:15:25] Abram meets God
[1:15:28] now who does Mel Cassidy become
[1:15:31] Jesus Christ right he gives communion to
[1:15:34] Abram all right
[1:15:36] from now
[1:15:38] he gives communion to Abram but now when
[1:15:41] that man Melchizedek
[1:15:43] becomes Jesus Christ
[1:15:46] he gives the communion again right
[1:15:49] and he says I'll not drink no more of
[1:15:51] this cup
[1:15:52] until I See You in My Kingdom
[1:15:55] all right
[1:15:56] so we come to a place where Jesus said
[1:15:58] hey
[1:16:00] sure he's our priest now but that man
[1:16:02] brother Brown said that man male
[1:16:04] president became Jesus Christ
[1:16:06] because the theophany that was talking
[1:16:08] to Abram
[1:16:09] because why could Jesus stand there and
[1:16:11] say before Abraham was I am
[1:16:15] he was the one that met Joshua he was
[1:16:17] the one that met Moses Mount Cassidy was
[1:16:20] not just something that appeared
[1:16:22] to Abram and nobody else
[1:16:26] but Abram piping Sons and Daughters of
[1:16:29] God he had to have a name
[1:16:32] Melchizedek the word melchized the word
[1:16:35] Mel malca means king
[1:16:39] and tezidek
[1:16:41] means
[1:16:43] what you see there king of pigs king of
[1:16:44] frieseness and all those all those
[1:16:46] things I didn't bring that but that's
[1:16:48] how you break down that word and that's
[1:16:50] how the people in the Old Testament see
[1:16:52] but then Paul picks it up in the New
[1:16:53] Testament
[1:16:54] he said this King he said that's
[1:16:56] Melchizedek the man Melchizedek so the
[1:17:00] man Melchizedek never leaves what am I
[1:17:02] trying to say the man male candidate is
[1:17:04] with you do your whole journey
[1:17:06] when I start telling you that the new
[1:17:08] birth is when God comes in you that
[1:17:11] doesn't mean that God's off somewhere on
[1:17:13] vacation
[1:17:14] and you're going through this journey by
[1:17:16] yourself
[1:17:17] no God's right there with you
[1:17:19] because remember he's a high priest what
[1:17:22] does the high priest do he makes
[1:17:24] intercession
[1:17:26] and Buddy and justification you need a
[1:17:28] lot of intercession I did I did I needed
[1:17:32] a lot of intercession
[1:17:34] on what your confession
[1:17:37] confess your sins confess your thoughts
[1:17:40] the Bible says one to another amen and
[1:17:43] the Lord will bless you all right now
[1:17:45] let's go
[1:17:48] and he gave him in verse 20 gave him
[1:17:49] tithes of all so we're done with Hebrews
[1:17:51] there what what Paul picked it up and
[1:17:54] told the people in Hebrews he was
[1:17:56] showing them that that Melchizedek and
[1:17:58] if you'll read Hebrews 5 6 7 8 9 all up
[1:18:01] to 10 you'll see how he brings
[1:18:03] Melchizedek right into Jesus Christ and
[1:18:05] we'll read that a little bit later on
[1:18:07] but not now all right now in
[1:18:09] justification as everybody got him
[1:18:12] foreign
[1:18:15] he's on a journey
[1:18:16] he meets Melchizedek
[1:18:19] Eva even the king of Sodom in verse 21
[1:18:21] let's go back to Genesis 14 21 in the
[1:18:24] king of Sodom Center to Abram give me
[1:18:27] the persons and take the goods and Abram
[1:18:29] said to the king of Sodom
[1:18:31] I have lifted up my hand unto the Lord
[1:18:33] the most high God the possessor of
[1:18:34] having a nurse in other words he's
[1:18:36] telling that man I met somebody
[1:18:39] guess what you do when you're in your
[1:18:40] justification you say look I met a man
[1:18:45] I met a man
[1:18:50] the words of a man
[1:18:51] you ever heard that before
[1:18:55] the words of a man
[1:18:57] and he told me
[1:18:59] he's going to give me come in
[1:19:02] other words let's read between the lines
[1:19:04] Melchizedek
[1:19:06] is it Abram I'll never leave you
[1:19:10] I'll never forsake you
[1:19:12] ain't that what Jesus said
[1:19:14] why couldn't you said it to him he told
[1:19:17] Abram
[1:19:18] who was at the toll label my will
[1:19:21] it's the same theosity same God
[1:19:23] this was just the garden that had come
[1:19:25] down in flesh and was speaking straight
[1:19:27] to Abram eye to eye
[1:19:29] he met Abram
[1:19:31] in his Justified condition
[1:19:34] right he's got to meet you the same way
[1:19:35] because every son and daughter of the
[1:19:37] faith has got to go through this same
[1:19:39] Journey right right
[1:19:41] know that you're Justified
[1:19:43] to know you're Justified is to know that
[1:19:46] you're cleaning yes
[1:19:47] on the condition of getting clean you
[1:19:50] understand what I'm saying not not you
[1:19:51] know sanctification is clean instead
[1:19:53] aside but at least you know that you
[1:19:54] have come from a position Abram realized
[1:19:57] one thing when he when when Melchizedek
[1:19:59] met Abram
[1:20:03] Abram knew God was close to him
[1:20:07] what about a meeting
[1:20:09] face to face
[1:20:11] and this King
[1:20:13] gave Abram
[1:20:15] Bread and Wine
[1:20:18] and he said Abram
[1:20:19] what is communion
[1:20:21] communing
[1:20:22] together
[1:20:24] we don't we take communion because of
[1:20:26] the of the of the the act in the in the
[1:20:30] Lord's suffering you know where where
[1:20:31] you take the wine and you take the bread
[1:20:33] but what is that communion means
[1:20:35] communion
[1:20:37] the Lord said
[1:20:39] we're going to commune together
[1:20:41] Abram
[1:20:43] now he didn't say Abram walk before me
[1:20:45] and be perfect that's later on in this
[1:20:48] journey
[1:20:48] so God only expect you to be perfect in
[1:20:51] justification
[1:20:52] the expense used to walk close with him
[1:20:55] all right now let's go to verse chapter
[1:20:58] 15.
[1:21:00] just for a few minutes we'll be we're
[1:21:01] finished later on after these things
[1:21:04] look after these things
[1:21:07] after what things
[1:21:09] the things we just talked about for an
[1:21:10] hour
[1:21:11] oh crap
[1:21:13] can I say that after these things after
[1:21:16] what things what we just talked about
[1:21:18] after the
[1:21:20] him leaving after him making mistakes
[1:21:23] after him giving his wife away or trying
[1:21:26] to and after these things after meeting
[1:21:29] Melchizedek after paying tithes after
[1:21:31] these things the word of the Lord came
[1:21:34] into Abram look at that capital l-o-r-d
[1:21:38] God himself
[1:21:41] came into Abram
[1:21:43] in a vision
[1:21:45] Abram didn't have a vision
[1:21:47] until he moved up a little bit higher
[1:21:49] into sanctification
[1:21:52] because this is a saint of right chapter
[1:21:54] 15 right chapter 15. we got a lot of new
[1:21:58] people here and I I don't want just to
[1:22:00] be my my thought because we all know
[1:22:02] these things we've been taught these
[1:22:03] things and preached them ourselves so
[1:22:05] chapter 15 is starting the
[1:22:07] sanctification process of Abram because
[1:22:10] remember you don't get a name change
[1:22:12] until you get the Holy Ghost
[1:22:14] you still in the old
[1:22:16] yeah
[1:22:19] but it's being changed
[1:22:22] after these things the word of the Lord
[1:22:24] came unto Abram in a vision saying fear
[1:22:26] not Abram
[1:22:28] I am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[1:22:31] reward what about God coming to you and
[1:22:33] telling you that
[1:22:35] well he does every Sunday yes right he
[1:22:38] does every time you read the Bible and
[1:22:40] Abram said Lord
[1:22:42] God
[1:22:45] what will now look if you've got a
[1:22:47] Scofield bible
[1:22:49] verse 2 says and Abram said Lord God if
[1:22:53] you'll read down that is Meister
[1:22:57] Lord God is Adonai Jehovah
[1:23:02] he starts calling him father
[1:23:04] yeah because Jehovah's a father with a
[1:23:06] family see they don't know the name of
[1:23:07] Jesus they have to call him by these
[1:23:09] names in the Old Testament you
[1:23:10] understand
[1:23:11] remember Jehovah is not God's name but
[1:23:13] that's what they called him because that
[1:23:14] was what was revealed to them at the
[1:23:16] time all right so Jehovah he said Abram
[1:23:19] said now he never said Lord God in verse
[1:23:22] chapter 12 13-14
[1:23:26] are you getting this
[1:23:30] the name is being closer to being
[1:23:33] revealed as you get closer to your walk
[1:23:37] with God
[1:23:39] Lord God
[1:23:41] Jehovah
[1:23:43] what will thou give me now look what did
[1:23:46] Abram do Abram is not being a smart alec
[1:23:49] Abram is reminding god of what he said
[1:23:53] when I started my journey God I remember
[1:23:55] you told me I was going to be a father
[1:23:57] of many nations and
[1:23:59] I ain't got a kid
[1:24:03] I go childless and the story to my house
[1:24:06] is this Alias are now we're going to
[1:24:08] pick eliasar up a long way over in the
[1:24:10] journey
[1:24:11] all right
[1:24:13] of Damascus
[1:24:15] and Abram said behold to me thou has
[1:24:18] given no seed and loyal one born in my
[1:24:20] house is my neighbor
[1:24:22] and behold the word of the Lord came
[1:24:24] unto him in other words Abram had a
[1:24:26] question
[1:24:28] and God quickly gives him an answer
[1:24:32] and behold the word of the Lord came
[1:24:34] unto him saying
[1:24:39] on bowels your own loins shall be thine
[1:24:43] air
[1:24:44] had to come from the man Abram ham not
[1:24:47] Abram
[1:24:48] remember Abram fathered a child right
[1:24:52] right but it wasn't the promised child
[1:24:55] we'll get into that we're gonna have to
[1:24:57] stop we'll get into it let's read one
[1:24:59] more
[1:25:00] one more verse and Abram said behold to
[1:25:02] me now it's given no seed he reminded
[1:25:05] God
[1:25:06] of his promise right
[1:25:08] now
[1:25:09] this is really
[1:25:12] verse 4 and behold the word of the Lord
[1:25:15] came unto him saying this shall not be
[1:25:17] thine air but he that shall come forth
[1:25:19] out of thine own bowels
[1:25:21] shall be thine air and he brought him
[1:25:24] forth abroad and said look now toward
[1:25:26] heaven
[1:25:28] look up
[1:25:29] and tell the Stars if thou be able to
[1:25:31] number them and he said unto them
[1:25:33] unto him
[1:25:35] so shall thy seed be now look at verse
[1:25:38] six we're going to stop right there
[1:25:40] and he believed
[1:25:43] in what God Said
[1:25:45] now wait a minute
[1:25:46] Abram said I'm childish this
[1:25:49] conversation is coming to a an end and
[1:25:52] Abram's still like
[1:25:54] I got a kid
[1:25:56] I don't get it
[1:25:58] but Abram
[1:26:00] being a father of our faith
[1:26:02] believe
[1:26:04] and he believed
[1:26:06] in the Lord and he counted it what God
[1:26:09] counted it to him for being right
[1:26:11] because that's what righteousness means
[1:26:13] being right right he counted it toward
[1:26:16] Abraham see listen
[1:26:21] we can stop ourself in our journey
[1:26:23] by putting a U.N in front of that
[1:26:28] and making it unbelief
[1:26:31] you can stop that
[1:26:33] Abram didn't
[1:26:36] because those who is Justified is
[1:26:37] already glorified that's right he knew
[1:26:39] Abram was going to make this journey
[1:26:41] you and I don't but Abram was going
[1:26:44] through this journey going gone
[1:26:47] I don't have no children
[1:26:49] and you told me
[1:26:52] that my people would be as the sands
[1:26:56] of the
[1:26:58] ground
[1:26:59] but of what God tell him in this part
[1:27:02] that's right don't look down anymore
[1:27:05] Abram look up
[1:27:07] if you can count the Stars if they'll be
[1:27:10] able to number him he said unto them so
[1:27:12] shall thy seed
[1:27:14] be and he believed what the Lord said
[1:27:18] and he carried to him
[1:27:20] for righteousness okay
[1:27:24] same way in your journey folks
[1:27:26] when you come to start into your journey
[1:27:28] of sanctification watch how Abram and
[1:27:31] God comes closer together
[1:27:33] watch how the communion between will see
[1:27:35] it this afternoon how the communion
[1:27:37] between Abram and God becomes closer
[1:27:40] and closer
[1:27:42] and closer
[1:27:46] because we're going to cover
[1:27:49] in this next chapter we'll cover
[1:27:52] Abram
[1:27:57] I'm still the almighty God
[1:28:00] I brought you from the earth child day I
[1:28:03] brought you through this journey
[1:28:04] but now you're gonna have to
[1:28:07] endure some things
[1:28:10] I'm going to put you in a vision
[1:28:12] and I'm going to show you that you are
[1:28:15] blanked out
[1:28:17] that you
[1:28:20] Kim Martinez has nothing to do
[1:28:25] when we realized that it's God doing the
[1:28:27] work right amen I told brother Mark I
[1:28:29] said when we get out of here it's going
[1:28:31] to have to be something Supernatural
[1:28:33] because natural will never get us out of
[1:28:35] here
[1:28:36] well Gary natural will never get us out
[1:28:38] of this that'll be Supernatural that's
[1:28:40] right and it's not something that we got
[1:28:41] to build ourselves up
[1:28:44] it's not something that we gotta take
[1:28:46] any kind of special vitamin it's not
[1:28:48] something that we got to work out
[1:28:51] no there's not us doing it right all
[1:28:53] right yeah exactly right yeah
[1:28:55] what can one man add to his stature
[1:28:58] what's the scripture says that's right
[1:28:59] not a thing that's right you couldn't
[1:29:01] determine how tall of course now they
[1:29:04] got growth hormones and all that junk
[1:29:05] I'm talking about natural
[1:29:07] right naturally there's nothing we can
[1:29:10] do to get out of here we're going to
[1:29:11] have to do one thing depend on God
[1:29:14] and you watch Abram in this next chapter
[1:29:16] depend on God and God actually puts him
[1:29:18] to sleep and said Abram you're dead
[1:29:22] because see when you can start going in
[1:29:23] the Sanctified process what does the guy
[1:29:25] do the guy picks up the jar
[1:29:28] then he cleans it up
[1:29:30] inside and out
[1:29:33] how she's fixing to put something in it
[1:29:34] you don't want to we go downstairs uh
[1:29:37] let me get you some mud and put it in
[1:29:38] your cup
[1:29:40] and you put you some good old tea or
[1:29:42] something in it and start drinking it no
[1:29:43] you don't want that
[1:29:45] God won't dwell in an unclean vessel so
[1:29:46] he's got to clean it up right we're also
[1:29:49] this afternoon we're going to talk about
[1:29:50] that new spirit we'll get to that don't
[1:29:51] worry I read that scripture for a
[1:29:53] purpose
[1:29:54] but let's sing a song in our journey
[1:29:58] and this afternoon do you know there's
[1:30:00] never been a day like this say you know
[1:30:01] that one no chance we'll see that this
[1:30:03] afternoon all right there's never been a
[1:30:05] day folks I told him in Kansas

[1:30:38] something right
[1:30:40] we were lost in need of Salvation Abram
[1:30:43] never forgot where he came from right
[1:30:46] because God's going to actually remind
[1:30:48] him in this next chapter we're going to
[1:30:50] read I brought you from the earth
[1:30:52] challenge
