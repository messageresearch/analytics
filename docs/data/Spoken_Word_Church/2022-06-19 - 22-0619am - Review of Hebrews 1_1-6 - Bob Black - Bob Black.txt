TRANSCRIPT
========================================
absolutely i love that lighthouse as we study these scriptures lord that our minds will be set toward your word lord that we will be ready to receive this morning when our brother comes forth to minister lord and we just ask lord that you'll be with him as he studies lord and lord that you'll just fill at liberty to move among us this morning lord and this afternoon granted lord that you'll bless the reading of your word now in your name so hebrews 6 uh and and just you know just to kind of set the context this is the scripture that god pointed brother branham to when he saw those those two men that were in in the meeting that one was one was genuine and one was one was fake and but they both had the genuine anointing of the holy ghost and moving and and speaking in tongues and and rejoicing and worshiping in the spirit and those kind of things so it says in verse four for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the world and the powers of the world to come if they shall follow a way to renew them again under repentance seeing they crucified themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame for the earth which drinketh into the rain that cometh off the opponent and bringeth forth herbs and meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god but that which bear thorns and briars is rejected and is not into cursing whose end is to be burned you know really if you want to just meditate on the sense of this scripture that paul is talking about you know there's a lot of people that rejoice and that are partakers of the holy ghost but if you turn away from the word then it's not going to profit you anything if you reject the word and uh and crucify to themselves the son of god afresh which you know that when they put jesus on the cross they they did so because they were rejecting his word and they they didn't just turn away from it but they they they they struck out at it and you know that when the rain falls upon the earth it's actually it's gonna bring to life whatever is in the earth and so we were reading that parable and we'll get to it again uh of that jesus said that jesus told of the parable of the sower and that this the seed was sewn into the ground and and that parable the good uh it's talking about the the the word being sown into into people well let's let's uh let's just meditate on some of the things that brother brahms said about about this scripture both partook of the same nourishment water and sun both prayed both received help from god for he maketh his son and reigned to fall on both good and evil and though they both had the same wonderful blessing and both had the same wonderful manifestations there was still that one great difference they were of different seed and so there's that parable in matthew chapter 13 that jesus began to talk about he that received the seed into the good ground as he that heareth the word and understandeth it so the good ground here is some his people is a is a church uh that that can receive the word for your day and bear for fruit which also bears fruit and bringeth forth some 100 fold some 60 some some 30. now maybe just just meditate and think think now you know we you you want to uh our goal really is to understand what's what's the difference between a genuine and a fake believer so that we can have confidence that we're genuine that were that were true how do i know that god is tabernacled in my heart how do i know that he's that he's in there that he's dwelling there and you know if if any any man was sitting in a house or anybody uh you know there's an evidence that you leave behind there's an evidence that you know if if a deer goes through the woods it leaves behind a trail that you can follow broken branches and and sounds and the little white tail that you can see runs through the bushes and things and and and you can see in evidence and evidence that that god is in you if he's there there's there's an evidence that you can look at so the evidence now we'll examine let's just meditate on that as we go through this scripture and i notice the parable that jesus taught i know it's it's a little bit hard to read but i've got a picture up there jesus teaching so if you can't read it let's just do like they did when they were listening to jesus and just listen and jesus said hear ye therefore the parable of the sower when anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catch it the way that which was sown in the heart this is he which received seed by the wayside now see this this is jesus explaining a parable of how to know how to know if if god is in you or not if there's what he's talking about is the different kind of people different kind of people that hear the word and react to it differently and really the sum of it is when you hear the word do you hang on to it long enough for god actually to come and quicken it to you to you or do you just let somebody the devil come by and snatch it away or let the trials of life or something something take it away from you when when when somebody tells you you know that all things are possible to them to believe you hang on to that when somebody tells you that the promise there's a promise of the new birth do you hang on to that or do you just let somebody come by and take it away well i don't know that the devil i i don't know if that's for me if there's there's a promise for healing and you you hang on to that and then god will bring it to pass so in verse 19 when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not there's a lot of things we don't understand right right away when we hear it you you hear so many things that are see seem puzzling and everything but if you just hang on to it then god will the spirit will quicken it and put things together put it together and make it plain but he that receiveth the seed into stony places the same as he that heareth the word and a nun with joy receives it first they start off real good start off running like you see people come to church and they they're so excited at first but but after a while they start stop coming and then you don't hear about them anymore i mean you just just think about all the all the ones back in your life that that you saw hit the ground running at first and then after a while that where are they and that's what jesus is talking about here he had hath he not rooted himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he's offended and that's that's what that jesus said the forgotten beatitude is blessed are those that are not offended in me because when you start becoming a christian there's many things that that it's people say things about you do things about you like i was preaching that wednesday night about the people that then we went with my kayak and somebody wrote on the back of my van because they saw that that picture of jesus on the back of our van there's a lot of things that that are offensive why'd they do that but that's not gonna i want the word i want the seals to be opened up i want to understand what this message about is about and when you're rooting if you're like jesus said if yet he hath he not rooted himself if you're rooted you're going to hang on because you want to see the word manifested he also that receives seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he become unfruitful now you can see that just just looking around that's that's what happens to a lot of people they get so concerned about money and more concerned about the world and more concerned about being able to watch movies and stuff than they are about the world and all that care of the world will choke it out well i i gotta go to my job instead of coming to church i gotta i gotta do this or that i gotta uh do all these side activities but if you're concerned the main thing the most important thing if the most important thing is the new birth and that means the most important thing is the word and if the word is foremost in your life then you won't do like this scripture is talking about that you just let everything in the world choke out the word until you just you just you just don't care about it anymore but he that receives seed into the good ground the good ground now that's a believer that will grab ahold of the word and say i'm going to believe this somebody maybe that like like brother brown gave the illustration that uh people have been making fun of you and and you kind of got low god will bring you down into a valley where you start to get desperate and something's got to happen and and i you you get tired of the situation that you're in that's some good tilled up ground that's ready to receive the word you're ready to do whatever it takes if it's go out into the mud pit um or and and stay there all night or like like that story that brother around told with the brother i'm willing to stay in the in the mud all night if that's what it takes because that's some good ground you don't have to all you got to do is believe but good ground is when you're at a spot where you're ready to believe but he that receives seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit now look at those evidences you hear the word and you understand but it doesn't stop there bears fruit so you got to put all those things together faith is going to produce it's going to produce fruit it's going to produce a changed life so hear and understand and bear fruit and bring it forth 700 fold some 60 some 30 because it depends on what your capacity is how much word you can receive what day and hour you're living in that's why in this hour we've got a surely we've got to bear more forth more fruit than the other ages did because we've got more word we're we've got to bear forth the fruit of the doctrine of this the coming of the son of man so let's think about he that heareth the word when you're when you're seeking the new birth you're you're the you begin to hear all these strange these maybe strange things and like on the day of pentecost in acts chapter 2 when peter began to what what was sown in their heart the word was sown in their heart and then the spirit came and quickened it what was sown christ was sown so what was peter preaching on the day of pentecost he was preaching christ and he preached he laid out for them who he was and why he fulfilled the old testament and he laid it out and he said and then their hearts were pricked and and they asked him well what do we need to do and he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you so you know you that's a word that's sown into your heart and you hang on to it and you begin to meditate on that that god promised that to me that god sent that to me and there's a promise to me there's a promise as many as are far off to your children and so parents hang on to that word and you're hanging on to that as a promise and and in matthew chapter 3 verse 9 think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you this is a scripture that i hung on to when i was thinking of the new birth that god is able of these stones to raise up children under abraham and i hang hung onto that because people will tell you well it's it's not for you and you know lay all kinds of reasons in front of you and all kinds of doubts and stuff but you you you look to the word instead of your own opinions your own ideas and you begin to hang on to that that's the seed that god that has to be sown into your heart that you hang on to and don't let the thorns and the cares of life and money problems and all of that stuff get in the way of it you're hanging on to the word of god you hang on to isaiah where it says surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken submitting of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions that means he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the last time we kind of examined what iniquity is to know what you need to do and you won't do it so he was bruised when for my iniquities when i knew what to do and yet i went away from and didn't do that thing whatever it was all those iniquities piled up he paid the price for that and see all these things that are sown in your heart and you begin to hang on to that until god makes it real you see why the new birth is not just feeling something but it's actually something being quickened the word that you hold in your heart is quicken until it's made real to you and then you got an evidence that nothing can take away the devil can't take away the people at work can't take away people maybe in your family there well i don't think it's possible i don't think it's real but you know it's real because there was something sown in your heart that you hung on to and till christ made it manifest you can see the word can always be questioned when it's on the page but when christ makes it alive it can't be questioned anymore you hang on to it and you're questioning it maybe but when christ makes it alive it's not questioned anymore so let galatians 2 20 really lays down what what the new birth is where paul said i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me there's somebody there there's somebody in my heart that's changed my thinking that's changed that's positioned me so that so that i can hear the word and believe it which is what paul is saying here in the next part of this verse the life which i now live in the flesh i'm in the flesh but i'm living by the faith of the son of god so that means that it ain't my faith anymore that christ's faith is corrupt when you get the new birth he's he's in there now and the evidence of that is that he can believe he's believing the word he wants the word that's that's why he's if christ is in you he's going to take you somewhere where you can get the word because there's a hunger in you i got to get the word you know even look back in your life where you thought maybe at first you know you really enjoyed the song service and you really enjoyed feeling good in church but then there came a place where you're like i got to get the word i want to know what this message is about i want to know what this gospel is about and something begins to work in your life and the word begins to open up that's christ in you to reveal the word and what see what when the word is being sown in you it's christ being sown christ be the word is christ and what's being revealed in you is christ so the new evidence of the new birth is a revelation of christ a revelation to you personally of jesus christ where you can see jesus christ that's what all of these things behind us on the wall that we refer to so many times are that this is jesus christ this is a the building the tabernacle of the living god as jesus christ the stature of a perfect man that he's built up and that's why paul said the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god so through justification and sanctification you're believing but when he gives you the new birth christ comes in and he believes and you don't understand everything at the new birth but your position then because god is there to believe god is there on the inside to believe and when you bring in the word he'll open it up to you so brother rahm would say in matthew chapter 7 or this is jesus again in matthew chapter 7 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven and we know that the will of the father is his word so here's the evidence the evidence that you're on the right track that god is there is that you're doing the will like and i gave the example earlier that uh you know somebody would say you know when they're sick they were somebody asked us to pray for them they were sick and they they said don't pray for god's will pray for or pray for me don't pray for me to get well pray for god's will but now we just read that he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities for our uh you know he died for our healing and all those you got all those promises and psalms for getting out the benefits so you look in the bible and you see his will is for you to be healed so that's what that's what i'm talking about is that if you know the word and the word is quickened to you then you know what he wants done with the word and he like in this example his his will is for you to be healed his will is for you to be saved his will is for you to be filled with the holy ghost his will is for you to be a christian that walks in the fullness of the word that's not tossed about by every every dot every wind of doctrine that's not blown around that can walk straight straight down that line of the word so jesus would say many will say to me in that day lord have we not prophesied in our name that sounds good doesn't it there's a lot of things you can do in church that just as you know under the influence of the holy spirit in church just being around other believers and listening to the songs that are song and things and in that name have cast out devils because judas casted out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works all of that's great but what about the word because the revelation of jesus christ personally to you as an evidence that god is in your soul that god has positioned you to receive his word he'll say then i'll profess unto them i never knew you i never i never had a relationship with you i never knew you like like in the natural like adam uh eventually knew his wife hey he never he never knew you he never he never uh quickened his word to you depart from me ye that work iniquity therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and see there's that evidence again whoso here whosoever heareth these sayings of mine if you can hear the word and then it goes into action heareth these sayings of mine and do with them i will liken him unto him a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the whole church is built upon the rock of the revelation of jesus christ so brother ramen with pergamy in church ages said and there it is you can't claim that manifestation is the evidence of being spirit-born spirit-filled no sir that means you can't claim that just because you ran up down the aisle or when they go to camp meeting and felt felt something up and down your back or whatever that your spirit feel i will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the holy spirit doing mighty acts but it is not the evidence of the individual being spirit-filled even though that individual has an abundance of those manifestations judas balaam cain all these examples down through scripture of people going to church and looked like they were doing right but the evidence of receiving the holy ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of our lord it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live now think about what he's saying there the evidence that somebody's there in your house the evidence like a deer running through the woods i know the deer was here because i can see branches is broken i can see the trail that he left the evidence that a man was in your house somebody he left footprints outside i can see his footprints the evidence of the holy ghost is that you receive the word for the day that you're living in so the evidence is you come to church and when the word starts to be preached you're like i want some more of that that's that's my foremost thing above everything else you you see if you're following the word if you're making decisions in life for the word you're on the right track right if you if that is your foremost thing in front of everything else in front of all the things in life that you want the word that shows that there's somebody somebody that's guiding you jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word the works would follow because if you put the works before the word then you're putting the cart before the horse but if you put the word for it first that's the thing that will produce the works so down on the inside and i'll get like just a few more minutes see my little diagram here down on the inside your soul can be as black as soot and i got a little the little serpent there but in your spirit and your body you can feel you can feel things you can be influenced by the holy genuine anointing of the holy ghost and if you want to study that out more go to the sermon anointed ones at the end time go to the god of this evil age satan's eden and read those things and study that out but in luke chapter 13 he said then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them strive to enter into the straight gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able there's many people that come to church and and like the example i gave last time so swinging incense won't save you and confess until you're a catholic priest won't save you there's a lot of things you go to church listening to the brooklyn tabernacle choir won't save you there's a lot of churchy things that we do but the word is what saves you just because you're in church and doing churchy things doesn't save you the word is what saves you when once the master of the house has risen up and has shut to the door and you begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us and he shall answer it and say unto you i know you not which you are then shall you begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence we we were in church and we we fellowshipped under the anointing the genuine anointing of the holy ghost and thou hast taught in our streets you were you are in our church but he shall say i tell you i know you not once you are depart from me all you workers of iniquity and iniquity is when you know something you actually know is right and you won't do it and you know one of the biggest things that really the umbrella example of iniquity is you know that you need to be born again and if you won't do it that's the master example of iniquity if you know that you need to be baptized and won't go be baptized if you know all of these things that you know you need to do that that there's something wrong but when god comes in and sets himself in your heart he'll drive out the iniquity from your from your soul and you'll begin to be aligned correctly to to receive the word the musicians can go ahead and come forward brother emma said some what is iniquity is something that you know that's right and you can see it and won't do it in your heart when you know that that bible teaches a certain thing and you won't do it that's iniquity as that seems a little bit deep and everything i i you you start talking about iniquity but see these things are laying a framework of a foundation so that one day when when you start listening to the seven seals then everything begins to get put together and you see what brother random's talking about when in that first seal he starts talking about iniquity and when it's got to be driven out and those kind of things everything's everything's a a building blocks that build up into the final culmination of rapture and faith to get us out of here and we'll just end right there god bless you [Applause] oh
