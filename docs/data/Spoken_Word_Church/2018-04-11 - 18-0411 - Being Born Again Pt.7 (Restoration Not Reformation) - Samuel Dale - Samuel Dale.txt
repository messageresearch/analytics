maybe show some times when he comes and do that but this just remember that father we thank you for this day in the hour that we're living thank you for the love that you have bestowed upon us into our hearts that father that we love you no matter what comes or goes that love grows greater and greater because it is from a father who loves his children and he's trying to make manifest for upon earth that's what we're trying to do is talk about you Lord so you come on the scene and manifest yourself into each one of us and let your love and grace be with us and father forgive our sins because we want to stand completing you have your way as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts and guide us in Jesus name Amen we'll go to giant Peter then we'll go to well I got it down here firstly 123 okay 18 okay for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot Hoover Li was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever now born-again by the Word of God all right you know what is the new birth the new birth is the birth of the word okay we're going now to Joel we'll go to 1 in verse 4 to get the foundational part that which the palmer worm has left at the locusts eaten and that was the locusts that left have to come cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm has left half the caterpillar eaten okay now we go over to our point of interest to verse 23 in the second chapter be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he had given you the former rain moderately now watch him he had given you the former rain moderately now we'll get to that in the message in a minute all right you got to get the former rain for you can have the latter rain all right that's plain since that's just something that ought to be understood and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the a terrain in the first month now that never happens unless there would be some situation in Israel you could go to a place and determine this can be done here this can be done it there it's in the gospel that you're talking about it's not in the natural rain it's only using that as an example to speak from all right now now will restore to you the years once now restore to you the years that the locust of the eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palma worm my great army once I said among you you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now remember as I said always when I read that scripture always reminds you that God's great army is not eating down but he permits it to happen right see when he says my great army that I sent among you he permits that to happen all right it's not that he does it or even causes it he permits it to come forth to her that you can have that point of understanding all right now I want you to think on this because I I try to redo and re listen to the services and this the pie service I preached on was I will restore all right now we went through a lot of things on that message of I will restore okay now we covered this point that I want to make sure that you follow to see there are some things that happen in this life days that was not here previously or in some other time it was spoke of give an example of or shown is to come forth but it's not in that point so then you're not dealing with restoration as we think of sure now you say well okay we we will come into world we sin we done we restored I that's fine no it's okay don't don't think I'm going all crazy in my thinking I'm just trying to get our thinking in the correct way of understanding of what it means restoration all right now I want you to think about restoration it's easy to use the terms as we think of and what does the word restore mean honor restoration restoration is not a biblical word is you know it's just restore all right it doesn't go to restoration you know what I mean all right now we know that it means to return back or to turn back or to return our to turn again or to come back in other words all right spiritually in speaking of it we know that the word restore means to something that was previously there something happens it's gone right and then it's restored brother Adam uses it like he'll drop something he says if I drop this and I pick up some other item he said that's not restoration he said restoration is to bring back what originally fell all right now get the point and then listen to what we're trying to get all right so restoration and I was trying to cover in that message we know that there's things like the seals is not a restoration because the seals were never preached they were preached by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 24 yeah okay but no man you know nobody didn't understand that it was a time for that it was not today for that it was to wait until the last angels message would come and then he would take up all the loose ends right and not only bring the loose ends of what was previously in the Bible taught by the Apostles and written all right he had to come and bring that before he could bring the other things sure he preached the seals he preached this he preached that he preached serpent seed in 58 right but then he would make a statement in his safe surface he was revealed in the seals well see everything was revealed in the seals when it comes to that amen everything is revealed in the seals all right but the seals were never taught by somebody and then had went away or taken away and then have to be restored all right the headstone was rejected by mankind all right even though the church received the new birth and the faith of the fathers still the head was rejected because he it no one could understand it so you don't deal with restoration all right now for heaven's sake don't think somebody when I'm in it I started dealing with the word Reformation don't think I'm trying to make something the Reformation more powerful that's crazy yeah I'll try to get to that in a minute but just for heaven's sake don't think that away all right listen because in the Bible way of using it the word restoration would be used when different numbers but have the meanings of it one of them is in the biggest portion of what's used of restore it means to return back or to come again or to be broke again all right now to restore means it was dire something happened and then it's got to be restored all right but don't deal with the things of something that's not in dealing with restoration you're going to miss the entire understanding of what is to be done so now we use restoration but now as I said you use restoration but what about this one now this is the word restore that is in jaw to where it says I will restore the years of the cankerworm locus the caterpillar now watch this point as we go along look at this definition I didn't give it to them so you know look at this definition it's a very hard word when it comes to this time it means to be in a covenant of peace now this is what joy means about restoration to be at peace peaceful 1:1 in covenant of peace and words to make peace with the comes to be at peace I'm reading this cause I want you to keep getting the peace the police the coven of the peace and then you'll see what joel is doing to make peace with the cause to be at peace to live in peace to be complete to be sound to be completely finished the ended to be sound be uninjured means to be complete is to finish it means to make safe it means to make whole or good or restore make compensation to make a good pay now this is the word restore from you to require recompense our reward to be performed to be repaid be required to complete to form to make an end of and what about when it could be summed up in a simple word of the other meanings of the word restore as to something to be returned the now you get into that and you find out there's something involved in jaw that we need to consider because it's not just dealing with a return it means to bring something to an end it means to bring it back to the original because if you don't bring it back to original you can't bring it to an end now listen to what I'm trying to get to and you'll study the message that's the way it'll help you listen to brother Branham brother Branham in his early ministry was talking about this messenger of Malachi 4 that it would come and restore all things then he'd bring forth the faith of the fathers all right you know how many times brother Branham uses the word faith of the father's we were discussing this in the Bible study the other night brother Branham uses the word faith of the fathers 57 times so it must be important he uses to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers 66 times he uses to talk about the Pentecostal father's restore back to the Pentecostal father's 40 times now anybody that's ever been in the message very long and you've listened to any message I'd say you're gonna find a rare occasion I've never found one sermon yet that didn't have the word restore in one way or the other to that relation because that was what he was to do all right then we know that the seventh church aids Messenger was to come to restore the faith of the fathers all right now listen to restore the faith of the father's would mean to bring back the faith of the fathers you say what is the faith of the father's it's the revelation it's the doctrine it's the thoughts that they bring it's the word that they bring it's the faith of the fathers it doesn't necessarily deal with signs and wonders as we think about because be careful because anointed ones can get involved in signs and wonders right so if don't lay it all upon we know we've got the faith of the father's because we've got great signs and wonders see now you you surely know the anointed ones are now to faith in the father so deal with it in the correct way and you will see why did I've always emphasized what is the new birth it is the birth of the word the word made alive so the Prophet when he came we'll get down to it in a minute where he gets over to a message of just the end of the silence or something like that and he names the mysteries and he picked up Scott picks up from Scofield of the name in the mysteries and the things and he gives you a long list of mysteries you know what those mysteries were to be made known before the last message would come now are you listening see faith of the father has a wonderful positional placing but as I've always say it I've always touted this away I always believed it this away that if everybody in the world had the faith of the Father it'd be a wonderful world a great place but it would not be the change of the body it would not be to bring forth of great things it would not be the opening of the seals see because that's the catch that you got to get of this man that was doing brother Branham was what first to be to bring us back to the faith of the father's back to what was in the Bible that had been preached by mankind then as we'll get to the lights of the message I know we want tonight but then we'll get in to the point to where he says not in the years of preparation not in the divine healing campaign but said when he begins to bring his message then you're gonna see that it's a two-part thing brother Branham had to come to bring it into two sections two parts I don't know how to explain it I just know what it had to do he had to first return the faith of the fathers then the seals would break all right see how else can you explain because he's constantly talking about the faith of the fathers see brother Branham didn't have to come and preach one God the Apostles preached to him he didn't have to preach serpent seed the Apostles preached they're not in the form of what we may be get it and bring it down to as to try to go into the garden and the thing that was the Prophet taking that to show you what they were teaching huh and see all the things that we talked about a long time was the early ministry of the Prophet and him bringing forth the message he was praying it to preach the faith of the fathers and that's why when he gets to the statue of perfect man he said I just got this the other day on something that I was going to preach well he's seen the faith of the fathers as to what it was but you see the seals is not an addition it's not extra it's something that was there that was not made known to mankind you remember he had to whip the top off the in the dreamer you know every what it was and looked down in the seals was down in that pyramid it was never seen by mankind nobody ever preached those seals and things oh yeah we Baptists I'm not joking we Baptist we preached the sixth seal as a tribulation what because you can read it people have looked into things but they couldn't see what it was all about and see the Prophet had to come and first do a work of restoration back to the faith of the fathers because we had lost that so much in mankind until we come out of it with Martin Luther of the just shall live by faith wonderful great play and brother Adam said that was the start well yet he'll call him Reformation but he said that was where it started out because ours were you two little shoots raises up right showing that it's going to come forth but it's not there it's not dying as fullness as Doris speaking of it and see then to stay faith of the father's that is the Bible as far as mankind had wrote and been able to understand the ought you get me there's a quote there somewhere close to it and paraphrase it but he's talking about that the Bible as far as man knew had been made known you realized when he stood back there in 62 [Music] is this the inside of the end he named the mysteries and he said this has been brought forth but he says now there's something else got to take place come on are we in the message do you need all these quotes where brother Brennan said Lord what am I going to do spoken word original seed he went through the Bible and showed that everything was dying the spoken word the regional seed but then when he gets over in the I believe it's the second message part of it but he says Lord what am I gonna do he said I got him out on the limb he said what am I gonna do the Lord said pick up your pen and write he started writing down and he wrote you'll read it he wrote exactly what he just preached the Lord confirming that to be what it was and then it stops he says but as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled now come on if we're gonna quote the Prophet let's go with him he says as of yet well what did he what what would you do if you'd have been him I'd have started trying to find out what why yet it got involved you know hey we stopped I'm out on the limb what can I hop in' he knew what he had preached but he knew then that there was something he hadn't preached he preached on the seals but he knew there's something wrong with it right he preached a white horse rider yet he knew that something wrong and see read spoken words regional seed and listen it read it real careful and get especially to that where he says what am I gonna do Lord he said I gotta go out on the limb he said pick up your pen and ride he picked up his pen and he wrote with when he stopped at the end of it is he's probably trying to lay his pin down it struck him the Spirit of God spoke through the man and he wrote it down he says but as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled all right see we thank Malachi for fulfilled in the fifties and sixties early or whatever no it wasn't fulfilled that was dealing with the faith of the fathers that was trying to get back to what has already been broke we had lost the understanding you understand what a mink oh that's the question earlier than that what is the faith of the fathers well you mean we've listened to the Word of God we have studied the Word of God and we've listened to the tapes and like I said 60 times 50 times that he speaks of the faith of the fathers and we'd asked what is the faith of the father it's the revelation they had that was already recorded in here when God was recorded by the Apostles and preached all the mysteries was there Paul would even speak of the chains of the body but he'd say there's something wrong I can't bring it I can't go any further he said I have to stay right here in other words read your Bible Paul knows he's bringing it up to a place but he knows he can't bring forth the fullness of it he could tell you about the change in a moment at Winkler and I because that's the spirit of prophecy the Word of God coming to the man's left but yet he couldn't tell what that was huh see because it was never put in the word brother branham is not I don't heaven help don't think that I'm saying brother branham headed to the word no way it was in the Word of God but not known by mankind of what it was Jesus preached those seals in Matthew 24 but nobody knew what he's talking about all right see because the point is if we don't get the face of the father's there's no need to talking about the seals other than listening to what is taught about them and trying to get an understanding of what we're doing to help us to come up the statue of a perfect man through the revealed word because like I said it don't you have a question when brother mo preached that I said well oh that's wonderful because we'd never heard anything or 71 running that point we'd never heard anything to that because we was under people saying well we don't know about this adoption is is a simple matter but statue a perfect man is a deep matter now we don't understand this we don't understand that it's you know what I said how do we go is this some secret code written somewhere in the message you remember when they found out how many tapes was drug a few years ago 14 or 24 or something like it they found of the messages and you know I'm sorry I'm human I'm sorry well look at that I've seen people just running I gotta get to him I got to get to him cause there's something in there it's been kept a secret until now well they got him it didn't do any good because he didn't know what to look for like wait is trying his best to bring out because you know I follow it because see that's what God revealed to me back gonna those seals is not Antichrist plot horse read Horner that's exactly what's going on out here the seals is a rebel a oh Jesus Christ didn't we find out by going over and over and over from Chrysler mister God revealed what is the new birth brother around them it's a revelation of Jesus Christ so when he comes over to the Seventh Seal and gets into the back of limits right it's either the sixth or the seventh he gets into the back of the message and he says now when this comes up he said gone so don't try to figure it out because you work your way away from it said go on with a same simple message it'll be made known to you when it's necessary is that yet par phrase in the quote close he said he even said it now like what he was bringing after Sunday you know you're preaching to people that was setting off when it was freeze but what did brother I'm sorry he said it's gone from you and he said there's no way for you to get it but said right around the coming of the Lord you said I got it I heard this I heard that amen I just have to say what he said he said he didn't get it well look God well okay I have no arguments with you it doesn't bother me for somebody to differ with me it bothers me when we won't listen to the word and try to follow the lineup of the word this prophet when he come in the last days when he come out there in 33 and all of that coming up he was a prophet amen but he groped in grace and knowledge through the opening of the word until he reached the faith of the fathers that's why I Illustrated it he said on statue of a perfect man he said these disciples apostle there was word and he was you he said they had these virtues he said they had these qualification he said they had the least little nod from God right the same message he starts explaining and he says there I was waiting he said I was waiting on him and he said then I got a nod from him and then I went prayed for the child or the woman or whatever it was showing us he was right to that position then he was right there at the faith of the Father that's what I tried to tell you you got Peter preaching the way to come to the statue of a perfect man right faith works our knowledge temperance placing huh and here comes Paul he don't listen to Peter he goes off to his self he leaves and goes to his self and he said no man taught me these times he said the Holy Ghost told me well when he came out what was he teaching adoption well what was he teaching adoption statue of a perfectly human Peter was saying identically the same thing right why cause Paul was a prophet the word could come to him and it came to him out on the backside he didn't have to listen to the rest of them showing you what God can do showing you do you realize if that wasn't our as an example of Peter saying this and Paul coming with this and them saying the same thing I'd have a hard time listening to brother Branham because of the way he talks because I would say how did you get it he wasn't that guard to listen to nobody else teach it right is that sensible he wasn't back tyre he never he got it from studying the Word of God until he got the same revelation Peter had he got the same revelation Paul had why cuz he got it from what they wrote and there he stands with that stature of a perfect man made within him he says but still I got a problem Lord then he says but as of yet Malachi 4 was not fulfilled well what did he set out to do I remember talking to a certain brother about I heard him I heard him make the statements before you've heard him to that he said brother branham said are you Malachi 4 he said yes he said would tell everybody he said you can't do it now that's what the man said you know I'm just quoting what somebody said okay in other words why don't you go out and tell everybody you're Malachi for the Lord Jesus never told everybody he was gone he just performed the works of God and you know what the genuine saw he was God the riffs are man he's not that the same thing that happened in the prophets ministry most people saw a man but some saw God in a man to bring the message to were that we could have the Word of God revealed unto us to be able to be restored back to the faith of the Father you don't hear anything about that people are not wanting to be restored back to the face of the slaughter they just want to know what the seals are in a message if you preach it to her in about 30 minutes I remember brother Moulton preaching on probably one statue a perfect manner matter of fact I think it was and this brother said something about it and he said that likes I'd like to study the Hat and you know get a better understanding said you could you you sent him in enticed he said yeah a sixty something of them and you called me slow and he said there was 60 something hug him brother said I ain't got time to listen all in this is what the words come back to him said you goofed off all these years and don't know nothing now something paraphrasing cuz he told him the truth they were I ain't got time to listen 60 something messages you had 50 years that ain't time enough to listen to 50 60 messages what do you been listening to my brother Luis was on the there the other wind Steve what have we been listening to you I don't have any trouble with anybody as long as I know they at least know what the Prophet says then you can deal with that but then when I said oh no no no you rock that right there within all I want to know what is right if the disciples didn't have the virtues as the Prophet said how in the world are we going to be able to get it if the Prophet didn't have it if the disciple didn't have time to work at you and I get it and I wasn't the one that wrote the book if you've listened to the stature of a perfect man you've heard brother Branham say that seven ages brains the church to a place he said in a seven virtues that will bring this people to a rapture oh you mean we've got to have these virtues it's not that we need them it's that we've got to have them somebody has all right see now getting to the point that we say I will restore all right let's deal with what was there and see that the will get to the restoration of the bride treif not if you'll listen to that message you'll hear this over and over for messengers of death took the tree down for messengers of life restores the tree if you listen to the restoration of the rod tree and I'd ask you if anybody has an extra copy of that for some reason I have misplaced mine of the restoration the bride Trina somebody has an extra copy of the restoration abroad tree I'd like to have one alright because i like to keep my books and and studying okay now then according to rest to the broad tree the same bug just changes stages you see the same thing wait talking about white horse riding a red horse rider like Walker I was sitting there the other day you don't never think and and listen I sitting every one way was talking the other day and you know he said to me he made the statement he said that went on is that white righteous church you remember you realize that church kept well going you realize the deception was in that early church just kept right on going but the rider got off and got onto the red worker kill do you realize that most of the people most of the people in no way ever had anything to do with the killing of the Christians you don't think they were good people in that white righteous church and they had nothing to do with killing the early Christians but it was the groups the leaders the ones that when it changed from a doctrine over and become killing most of the people were not involved with that killing they were trying to help them don't change me that's all that was criminal something goes wrong knowledge no it didn't those people went right on trying to serve Jesus Christ and God looked down in a lot of it and winked at the ignorance and and let it go but then they started killing the red horse then it changed to the black horse ain't changed to the pale horse it was the horse it changed the rider was the same it was just the situation's but I was just sitting there thinking Lord don't people realize that that church when it went out when that devil tried to get into that early church it didn't get into everybody they was good people there was good Christian people out there but then the enemy started taking over okay but listen why don't you listen sometimes and think about what it is so you just think get off the white horse we start killing everybody no that's just like today there's people that love you that would give their life for you and yet they don't believe what you believe they believe enough in God right to be able to be good people I don't look at the world out there Oh everybody's the devil everybody said watch that group I said yeah well I said devil everybody's out there Devils no I look at these people sitting right over here that's just what they can be they have the opportunity to be foolish virgins and you know what the only difference between them and us is the new birth in the soul the rest of it is a religious people that are a lot of times more sincere than we are more honorable and respectable than we are well yet we're bride we ain't them oh maybe they got something we ain't got come on my daughter think okay get off of it but listen you realize what I'm saying there was things that the Prophet tells you that we're never back there and it was not restoration because they wasn't back there as brought out into the world then it would come to his day and he would have the message and listen I know the quotes listen he said this messenger he said he has no special there's one quote wrong no special means he said he's just to straighten up all them others be careful if you don't have one thing correct you're gonna make him a reformer you're in bad shape I won't get tired at night I know it Kota I've been laying this down for weeks to get it right let's don't make brother branham a reformer but you know Martin Luther was a reformer but yet he started the church back on the day when it was posted and without him started it wouldn't be here now but Martin Luther was not bringing restoration he was trying to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the baptism the Holy Ghost was already there the Holy Ghost had never you ain't getting the point that the Prophet makes out of it it's the Holy Ghost in every age there's never been a age without the baptism when the Holy Ghost come on sure at least be sensible there's no age without the baptism because that's like I said no the other day if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and have raised to quicken the word that age is going to have to go to the White Throne but even Martin Luther because you've got to remember you're dealing with an individual and what he's bringing compared to an age Luther's AIDS was an unfulfilled age right is that out of the church borders but Luther wasn't unfulfilled Luther was the bride across that day the church that's why we need to listen to find out what's going on the baptism of the Holy Ghost was not to be restored to restore it back like the day of Pentecost with the Apostles yes but not to restore the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a new birth it was in every church age so you're not dealing with restoration we were talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost come on get it in the right order the faith of the fathers is what's got to be restored the revelation the doctrine the teaching of the fathers he's got to be restored right now what are we getting to the baptism of the Holy Ghost was never eaten away it was the word that was eaten away come on we don't have time to get to it but remember what it was can't conform to local scatter pillar what was it one eight fruit one eight two leaves one eight to bark and one eight to life it went into the roots and had to start back over and Luther started back in the right way to bring back but he didn't bring the life in the natural type of way he was bringing it he had to lie for his time you see all I'm trying to do is get you to think think about as I said brother Brennan said if you don't know what the Holy Ghost is how do you know whether you got it or not I know I got it cuz I spoke in tongues well praise God what the devil is in all of that you got to get to the one thing the devil can't get in to enable one thing he can't get in to that is the revealed word now he can get into the letter and try to con you know bring all kind of things but just quote the word you're talking to somebody just keep saying that word you watch them in a minute and they'll start backing away carrying away cuz it nobody can't do think what you're doing you just keep saying that bringing that word and you'll see it come to an end all right now listen the Holy Ghost was in every Church age in every church age was the life of Jesus Christ every church age was the age of the born-again believer ever church age you know the age of the people the bride was never in the age you've got seven ages with the bride was never in there she was never in the age she was called out of the age when you're called out of the age you're called into baptism of the Holy Ghost that brings you out of the age physically we're still here physically we're here in lady o sail right but spiritually you're not supposed to be in lady ousia Martin Luther was the message of the judge shall live by faith and glory hallelujah where would we be if he hadn't started with him so don't misunderstand now as we go along and talk about him as a reformer and try to making something that brother branham doesn't make him you say what's this got to do with the statue of perfect man I thought you said he's gonna get there I hadn't got there far enough yet because we're just kneeling now what took away what was took away from the early church not the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was there the Word was eating away right the word was what was eating away now you can go into your church agency and lie still about the Third Age weights covering that part so it's real good working in with we haven't planned these things it's just his way and my way but you come up to do those ages and read around and said there was none greater than Martin look at him where he's at Martin comes up to the 3rd Turk Church and he said there's nothing greater than the Lord Jesus was the only man greater to Martin he said they was miracles and ever service the great things happened Columbo or how you pronounce it Columbo Columbo he was the fourth one you see it then as it begins to just deteriorate more and more you realize what I'm talking about Church think with me please here's the faith of the father's the understanding of the faith of the father's they had these virtues but they had this in the aides part and as it did these things would be added as needed and they were teaching us how to come to where they were - were your keys that somebody's got to teach us but we don't got the prophets message praise God but we've been here 50 years blabbering about it sorry I'm saying this 50 years ago - maybe not as strong I'm sorry I know I sound like I'm as hateful as all get-out without swap places will you and let you see what Christ saying to you to come and bring to the church if I hurt your feelings I'm sorry but if I save your soul we ain't gonna be worried about your little feelings if the truth is what'll set us free then we need the truth well I just listen for myself go ahead according to the Bible you can't do it now according to the faith of the fathers I said I'd get around to preaching that one these day gotta remember nine spiritual gifts right that's gifts but you're gonna find out one of these days that the fivefold ministry is more than gifts come on I got the notes I don't worry about it I fold ministry comes predestinated eternally from God you know the argument is whether or not I'm called that's your business right that's your choice the argument is not according to the word the argument is according to whether I'm part of it well I'm not the one that got in the statue of perfect man who says Lord fill me up with these times thanks Berkshire knowledge temperance patience godless brother because he said that I may teach others apostles prophets evangelists pastors he to bring these things into the church did you read that did you read that in the statute program or did you sleep through I used to get so tickled that brother would be he he said I'm sitting there on the porch listening to tapes and he said I said sometimes I sleep sometimes I listen no that's not the way we do but listen church why would the Bible the profit and the natural router called Martin Luther a reformer while we call him a reformer what is the word reform name what about it the word reform means the improvement are admit admit meant am en da NT amendment of what is wrong or to correction it's something that's unsatisfactory because it's not fulfilling it's trying to change from that state to a better state or form I'm giving you a Webster's definition of a reform why would it call Martin Luther a reformer what's the key that would give us great understanding cuz I surely hope I don't have to keep preaching over and over because I preach to you just what I've always believed when brother Branham come into this world he was born the Prophet but he didn't have everything he didn't understand everything you understood a whole lot more than we understand oh yeah oh no problem but he growed in grace and knowledge all right and then growing in grace and knowledge as I said he come up through the statue of a perfect man then he says but Lord broken words reading see I've got him out on the limb now what will I do then the Lord says as of yet Malachi 4 was not fulfilled brother Browns message didn't begin in the seals I mean didn't begin in 30 threes or anywhere you want to hear his message begin right along in the opening of the sealed I wouldn't want to say that he did I'll give you those quotes there you think got two notes you got him in front of you you know the Prophet said not in a year of preparation he said when he begins to sign it brother Browns message begin to be sounded starting there in the 62 and coming on over 63 64 65 cause it lice about three and a half year and he brought the secret things to us but at that stage he had already taught a statue of a perfect man he had already taught adoption mm-hmm but what about it go ahead and our brothers and let's put up a few things and get started like we get this a little bit and then we'll quit look at number 1 which is paragraph 257 and 258 there's Summerlin church h rd c and george a you got what they call now what be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready for to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God now that's to the age that's not be to just the unbelievers that's to the age okay now listen I wish it could be said the sardian age was a restoration instead of a reformation I cannot say that the word does not call it a restoration but certainly calls it a Reformation were sat out in the word I don't know go ask him he's one just said it you want to argue with him go ahead he said it was in the word he says the word said fifteen hundred years ago Martin Luther was coming where's that in the Bible it's in the message you ain't listening to what I said while ago he come to bring the things that were sealed up of mankind that we couldn't understand listen he called it a Reformation don't matter Luther's age now what had it been a restoration that will age would have been another Pentecostal age but it was not the best that could be said of it was strengthen that which remains that is ready to die there was something missing my yes there certainly was this age had justification known read him we did that miss sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost the age had justification Martin Luther had the baptism of the Holy Ghost for that age but the age itself will read it the minute was unfulfilled right watch the age and watch the individual that is what God's original plan was that is what they had at Pentecost they were justified they were sanctified they were filled with the Holy Ghost why listen to me the reason for being justified and sanctified is to the end that you might be baptized with the holy God all right that's the reason there is a church it's the temple of God filled with God even the Holy Ghost coming home down the listen this age did not have those works the Pentecost show that they did the works that he did he didn't have it Martin Luther's they didn't have the works coming out there like it did on the original deaf penny column this age did not have those works oh they had the written word but not the revealed word it reads your prophet this was the Reformation period but fear not little flaw God said I will restore and this reform was going to be the start of it Luther was the start of restoration but it couldn't be restoration he's explaining to you why he was giving to according to his promise he was going to according to his promise take the church back from the depth of Satan in the Dark Age to the depth of God that they had at Pentecost in the first few years of the existence of the church that was what he wanted but they never got it in that age listen to what he goes on to say I have not found that works perfect before God do you know what the meaning of not perfect really is it is unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled age it was just the start of getting back never lose those thoughts Martin Luther was the start of it coming back right don't throw him away it was just the start of getting back that's why I said the Bible called it Reformation not restoration the Bible called Luther Reformation he got a Scofield Bible go in there and find that and you'll find the Scofield saying Luther was a reformer because that's what the world taught him as being because he never brought forth another day of Pentecost he brought trying to reform the church Martin Luther never started with the idea of getting out of the church he started with and tried to the end to reform the church from the ways that had went away from he never wanted to leave the church he wanted to straighten the church out right but it didn't work so they told him out what that's why I said the Bible called it Reformation not restoration and it started out in the doctrine of justification which meant salvation was of God and how Luther pre the sovereignty of God an election he knew it was all of grace he separated the church from rule by ecclesiastical hierarchy he tore down the idols now like he done pretty good he kept out the confessions to the priests he denounced the Pope it was wonderfully good as he started but God had said 1,500 years before Luther you are going to start things but your age will see it all unfulfilled and what about the great man that we talked about of the message equated number three a resume of the church failure we rejoice in this age for this one thing Reformation had started he's happy for Reformation what's it it was not a resurrection Martin Luther but a Reformation neither was it a restoration but the corn of wheat that had died at Nicaea and then dried it in the dark ages now sent up a shoot of true signifying that some future day at some future date at the end of the lady of center at least an age just before Jesus came the church would go back to being a wheat seed bride again while the tires would be harvested and burnt in the lake of fire Luther come up with two little shoots that was not looking like the original right the original was the corner wheat full corn ready to plant dried everything else that's what's died and went into the ground the full word went into the ground and I see you I know I've tried my best to preach it until even ministers different with me on the basis and they said the bride never went to Nicaea I didn't say it brother branham said he did so I'm gonna stay with what he said he said they went to Nicaea right see we can get our little philosophies well that don't look right see this is a better way of understanding all right but it ain't the word I'm sorry then when that happens to me I said okay show me into word that's all I said just show me the word Martin Luther's age was a wonderful age I would love to live back there because to just be a Christian you'd lose your life they put their lives on the line they were coming out at the end of that are in that Reformation was coming into that thousand years that the church was ruling and Martin Luther was not the first one to protest the Catholic Church know there was plenty of them you got Whitfield and Knox and Calvin and in all kind of different ones you got all of them that was back there that's where you got it I read that while ago it was the age of the written word the written word would come back into being that you could study the Bible and they started writing their own doing then you got the Whitfield's you got the different ones that wrote their own Bibles it was a wonderful age in time yet it was not back to the original so it would be called Reformation okay not restoration and wouldn't he be called resurrection go ahead to the next one 372 77 scuse me still in there is only age this age started after out this age started after the turn of the 20th century and it was to be the age in which the true church now listen to he talking about I didn't Luther him look who he's talking about age it was to be the age in which the true Church would return to being the bride Azusa Street started it come on forget that well get on down here just hold it all together and watch him in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost now that's a promise I love it we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power the believer since this in their spirits and begin crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not the wooden restoration Juicer Street was a baptism of the Holy Ghost coming back as the people to match the book of Acts come on the match the book the book of Acts with the three thousand outside and the babies who had to be taught the sincere milk of the word that you may grow barber there by Paul having trouble with the Corinthians that's why though the word Corinthians he wrote two books to them Corinthians is what the book of Corrections he was always correcting them why cuz there were babies they had no trouble with Ephesians my other being but twelve but they were straight he said brother Brent said the Ephesians had to give but he said Paul didn't have to put him in order another words paraphrasing but listen it was believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the British spring our teaching rain the latter rain then is the harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come now listen the Prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the coastal fathers had not yet come that's what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the rapture had not come it was mixture of the unrighteous per taking our spiritual blessings and manifesting in the Holy Ghost the anointed ones right as we have kept pointing out to you it is also was devil power as men were under the control of the devils of devils yet no one seemed to realize it than to prove that it was not the real these people even before a second generation that appeared organized and wrote their own scriptural doctrines and built their own fences as ever other group ahead of them did now when we give the definition just in a second of a Reformation you're gonna see what it is Reformation is trying to reform the previous age and see that's what that was exactly trying to do instead of that they wound up and organize themselves that's what Susur Street just remember now the bride was in done okay but it wouldn't bring it forth in the right way okay go ahead to number five this is the first seal now look what he says Reformers came to reform the lifes fallen church age preceding them okay and then after the Reformers come and reform the church age from where it was and this went back into the world then they start a new church age always done it always now we went through that in other words it been a Catholic Church age of the Roman Catholic Church Along Came Luther a reformer and watch him he's a reformer and what does he do he starts out dire a hammering away and when he does he protests the church and the first thing you know what does he do he builds the same thing that he come to drive out of another church then they have another church age then the first thing you know here comes the church ages in such a mess alone comes John Wesley another reformer see and builds another church age get what I mean another church age is built up there all reformers now he's explaining the zoo the street of what it took plays well notice this life's message of the life church age is not a reformer he's a prophet not a reformer show me where one prophet ever started a church age he's not a reformer he's a prophet others were reformers but not prophets if they would have been the word of the Lord comes to the Prophet that's the reason they continued on in the baptism of Father Son and Holy Ghost all these other things they were reformers and not prophets they didn't see why Luther was a Trinitarian baptized and father son hello right Wesley was a Trinitarian Azusa Street started out Trinitarian it was about 80 14 13 somewhere out in there that you get Haywood and them Seymour 19:30 excuse me you you see them start coming with the oneness doctrine right then brother Branham picks up to bring us the truth of the doctrine all right so now watch what he said because they were reformers not prophets but yet they were great men of God and saw the need of the day that they lived in and God anointed them and they sent out there and tore those things to pieces but the full word of I'd never come to them because they was not profits they were reformers so what's going to be restored the word the reformers had to move of God is that you see what he's saying the Reformers Luther Wesley Azusa Street even had to move of God but there was no profit to come to bring the word to restore the faith of the fathers come on one of the last days that'll have to be a profit to take up the mistress of God bring it back because the mistress was mistress was only known by prophets so it has to be this fella come see what I mean now he can't be a reformer it's got to be a prophet because it's got to be somebody that's gifted and said that Dyer that catches the word and then reformers know there was something wrong look Luther know that that that the bread wasn't the body of Christ and so he preached the just shall live by faith and that was his message and then and when John Wesley come along he saw that there was sanctification Troy preached sanctification that was his message see the Pentecostals brought in the message of the Holy Ghost and so forth but in the last days in this last age the messenger is not to start any Reformation but is to take all the mysteries that those reformers left off and getter them together and solve them to the church now do you see what I'm trying to get you to say see the statue of a perfect man is the faith of the fathers the word was lost to the ages they come out with Trinitarian doctrines they come out with all kind of things then a prophet had to be sent he had to come and try to preach the stature of a perfect man to give me in you an opportunity to believe it right he brings it up as far as he can bring it and he says I got him out on the limb what am I gonna do and God said that enough yet Malachi Ford not fulfill he thought it was come on but it takes a prophet see it took the Prophet to go back and get those things that's why they were reformers now come on don't be no smart at it with me I try to be just as plain as I can I know the quotes come on I can quote you Herbert around cause Luther a prophet he calls Wesley a prophet he calls the Holy Ghost he came on as US history a prophet come on I can quote with you so don't just go running on say he don't know what he's talking about like how I know where the Prophet said that Luther was a prophet he was a prophet because the just shall live by faith came to him Wesley was a prophet because the word came to him but the age and the time was reformers they could not go any further because there was nobody in Luther West their Pentecost to be able to go back and get that faith of the fathers and bring it out and show what had been eating away come on I'm done running too late now so we'll pick up this one if you want to you read restoration the rod tree well that's where we'll start up from because those four messengers ate it down the four messengers we'll bring it back right whatever took it away is gonna bring it back but just get the prophet or what you say it he said Martin Luther was a reformer he said John Wesley was a reformer he's even call Azusa Street the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost coming back he calls it Reformation why because it was a restoration to the gills Luther was arrested right now listen you say yeah but now you're blabbering called you running off Luther was a restoration of the just a little by faith Wesley was a restoration of sanctification that was written in the Bible Azusa Street was a restoration of the gifts remember take that gift all the way and don't dis run it with gifts take it to the fivefold ministry and his gifts take it or the prophets say it is you've got to be in the body to have one of these gifts what's he talking about stature of a perfect man those anointed ones can have all kind of guilt get the prophets message and understand it please Church because listen let me give you one thing in will end it I'll back up and come back to this but let me give you one thing if we can run over her to it to show you how this prophets message we talk about melikhaya for we talk about it 327 Church age book this messenger of Malachi 4 is going to do two things 1 turn the hearts for the children back to the faith of the father to reveal the seven thunders which is revelation contained in the seven seals it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn us back Malachi 4 says what behold I send you Elijah you'll turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers I mean fathers to the children turning them to the New Testament message and the heart of the children to their fathers now that's two different Elijah's right Elisha number one turns the children turn the father's to the children and new testament message which fulfills Luke 1:17 okay alright and the hearts of the children to their fathers turn us back to the faith of the father reason I say Luke 1:17 see we win the organization we talked things you had never heard it said this away John turned them the hearts of the fathers to the children he pointed to Jesus then he turned around and turned them back go Luke's 117 sounds like his go ahead get looking 7 170 no come on get that one it's right in front of you know Luke 1:17 ok here we go they'll have joy and gladness talking about John the Baptist where he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and she'll drink neither wine nor strong great John the Baptist and many of the children of Israel shall he turned to the Lord their God amen and he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of allies to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that's melikhaya for that we've just read now watch and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just that's been taught by people in this message talk this way John the Baptist's come and turned it and then John turned it right back because that's what he'd be doing see if he turned him had him turned it from the father's to the children and then if you want and then let him turn the disobedient to the wisdom of the just you turn it right back under the law you say that ain't out that's been taught this message why wouldn't you listening somebody was told right here in this pulpit but not my brother mode so I'll make sure block that but listen Church do you know this scripture you know that Elijah is promised in the Word of God as a top do you know it go ahead with an extra kings you got it roll it a little closer I have to get to the king dirty now remember what this is about this is Mount Carmel go read it back this is Mount Carmel now what happened at Mount Carmel watch it and brother Brennan said ever born-again believer as a Mount Carmel experienced it came to pass on the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the Prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let me be known this day that dark God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at thy word you remember what happened back before then he restored the altar right you had him to dig around him to pour water he restored the altar remember that now watch what he said here o Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again that's the natural Israel because they walk with Moses and they fathered Moses a lot of them didn't went the other way and died but Moses returned the altar he built it all back he brought the word the brother run says he restored the word Elijah brought the word the building back of the altar and then when he did remember he told him said dig a ditch around them pour full of water pour the water all over everything said let's see whose God that's what I love know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again that's this last days church the Prophet had to get everything back in order but Aaron's message had to restore the altar had to restore all the things that the children of Israel back gar they had allowed the enemy to take down and when it was restored back then the fire fail you get this message in the right order and keep on going with it fires gonna follow one day you said well what are you looking for the fire to follow what if I got a right to look for the fire to fall I got the pipes behind it I got the words of the Prophet I got the Bible that says it then he'll turn the hearts or their children back to the faith of the fathers and he says back gar said Lord and a Mount Carmel experience I wouldn't want it said it but run said ever born-again believer had a Mount Carmel experience in your Mount Carmel experience you're going to realize the word is right the Prophet brought the message he brought the fact of the restorer in the faith of the father's then his message started as he said in 62 spoken words original see all I do Lord I've done everything you said to do I've got it all the tops and shadows and everything right read the book he was right he had everything right God verse out it by saying pick up your pen and write it's in bold letter he's writing they wrote God wrote it and he was writing it down he stopped and the Spirit says that no yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled when did Malachi 4 come into being the hearts of the children to be turned back to the faith of the fathers and then it's got to go on it's got to go on to the change of these bodies it's got to go on to the things that the Word of God shows and Elijah back yonder at Mount Carmel said Lord let them know their hearts have been turned back let me ask you some questions and see what your answer is and many gods do you have okay how many God did this disciples higher did this not did a disciple to understand predestination they wrote it do you understand predestination how did the apostles baptize how do you baptize are you getting what I'm saying if you think for a little bit about your own experience you will realize in your experience you've turned back to the faith of the Father if not we have to be put it that way if not we have to be because if we don't we're not going in the change we may go by the grave I'm sorry I didn't say it God told me I come and said it 40 years ago that the biggest portions of people this message would die and go by the grave I'll probably be just as much in that bigger mess as everything else is but I ain't worried about it because it's not it not that way it's the fact that we know what they're waiting on you and I they've done their part they fulfilled their part the great ones that have walked before you and I that have taught us this message they've left us with a point that we at least have an inheritance we've got something that we can claim for our own it's not a dishonor to go by the grave it's their honor it doesn't mean they don't have the faith they haven't may have a whole lot more faith than we've got but yet it's still the truth it's going to be a small group that comes to that change of the body that's what we were talking about Saturday night when they were destined the question was asked well all born into getting believers go in the rapture run around said no what he said that's some question as an answer sixty-four he said no he said only the remanent you mean ain't nobody going but a little bit of grouping in time come on church what's he talking about he ain't talking about as it was tried to be explained that that was a the people out there that claim the baptism of the Holy Ghost they didn't ask him that question they asked him a question we're all born-again believers going to rapture what was his answer no only the elect the group well because he's talking about the change in a moment a twink that we're not only the remnant will stand here and be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the rest are depending upon you and I to be able to make their body change I tried to explain it there Saturday all I could do just say it you can't put him to answering questions wrong in this age doing this but put it to a sensible answer he said they were just a remanent they're just going to be a little group that's gonna take the change in the moment a twinkling of an eye with the rest of I think I ought to do it because the dead in Christ shall rise first the dead in Christ shall rise before you in our change their resurrection and they is their change they don't come for that old people and then are changed into young people they come out of that away that they are in Christ and you and I will be standing there they're dependent upon us there's just a little bit of a group of people that's going to take the chains in a moment the twinkle of an eye I snap my fingers because people on tape will know where I'm talking about I'm talking about the change the change every born-again believer goes in the rapture ever born to get believer goes in the rapture but they're waiting on you and I to come to the message this profit has brought us to the main stage I don't see why we couldn't go with the scriptures and the things that we are and to say the fossils taught it this is what we teach you that away do you think you got to face the father's I say it's here ain't got no argument about it if you ask brother Branham did he have the faith his father's he probably answered the same question he'd say it don't look like it because he said at the end estatua program at Lord fill me up with this virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness that I may teach others see the word is right we don't have to prop up nothing to do nothing we just have to believe it and then see what he's talking about I never D Christian I was nobody when I said that I didn't say it I told it 40 years ago that God told me the biggest portion of people would die and go by the grave and I said then they're believers in this message they're not just the world people we know they're going that way but most of people this message know nothing about the message that the Prophet is brought I told you I'm sorry but see we take this and we do that with it and I told you we stood in front of probably 1012 ministers talking on Daniel 70 weeks and you know a lot of them ministers had never read Daniel 70 weeks did not even have a book but yet they could explain all about what brother Branham was talking about he says on Daniel 70 weeks he said if you don't understand this he said you can't understand the seals it's on the inside of your book it's on the front page of your book turn that Daniel 70 weeks book and open it up and look on the first page right there it has it that you can't understand these things you can't understand the seals and the things without understand within what's wrong with trying to understand that's tan you think on these things we'll finish the next week Sunday the Lord with it think on these things this message has all the answers yet we can turn down the answers and the things and let it go into dub ears death of years would call them come on brothers brother Aaron the new East brothers come on getting ready to sing but let's pray for these four we won't forget it for the Bob come on let's pray over these because they want to take them and give them to the people in the nursing homes in Zion and we're just praying that God will bless them reach down and touch their bodies and heal them and deliver them as these are laid upon them it would be prior clothes just like everything else they can have their own and don't worry about how many times they wash you because you can't wash off the anointing of the Holy go you ever got a prayer clock don't worry about getting it in the mood take it up and wash it and to say thank you lord it's just as good as it was because you can't wash off the Holy Ghost believe the words all right let's pray father we lay our hands upon these little partials here and they're just like prayer close to us and even some of them made these things and they want to give them to the people at the nursing home help them what they have need of what these are late across that your love come forth in the grace and love and understanding and father just touch them that no matter what it'll bring forth your loving grace thank you Father bless them got each one we love you in Jesus name I just give them to the I don't know who's gonna take them whatever who's gonna take them and let him give them out and whose all right what do we got anybody have a need the altars open you see Church it's too late to play and they say well we don't know we're isn't there was no argument back there when Elijah said he'd let it be known that these people's hearts had turned back well you know what that's gotta take place somewhere or you would violate every scripture related to that it has to take place somebody's hearts got to be turned back there's got to be a change there's got to be a lot of things why can't we believe we're the people well I just don't see it well you never can see it you never will see it because you're looking at it in the wrong way that's why I quoted that you know what I'm saying that what brother Owen said he was talking about the faith fathers he said how many gods today hell how did they baptize that worked what was he saying we have the same faith the same revelation of the word of God that they had if not when we're gonna get it when is it coming go ahead with it I think anybody having known for what a day that will be you have a need just coming up believe there is coming a day when no heartache schalke no more let's go no more tears - demi wispies big older true glorious day my Jesus I shall see and upon his face the one who say when he takes me but he leads me through [Music] Maria stay that will be sir more sickness [Music] and [Music] you heard our Lucy you just reach down and touch her father we thank you the testimony of these little ones we love you thank you her sister they drew [Music] coming lessee glorious day [Music] it's bleeding heart Lord he's trying the only doing just asking you to move on physically in the bottom he names me we need you budgeted intervene to make him to come out the rap life we just thank you for we love you we thank you didn't eat anybody else [Music] [Applause] are we trying to reform or do we want restoration reform is to just try to stop from doing things that we were doing restoration is to bring within us and let the virtues be living to outwardly remember the quote the other day these virtues must come from the inside reclamation is just quitting this or quit now oh that's wonderful but is no salvation involved reclamation is a reformer we need restoration [Music] just remember my one brother Alvin him was asking about sister Anna my nephew he got run over by truck backed over and they've already done one operation on his lagging and then I think his shoulder and now they're going back to do another operation and to fix his shoulder and everything and just pray for him but he just got beat up all over you know and just pray that the Lord would touch him and bring him through these things oh this a day and the time is you an hour to be concerned more than ever in their hearts and our lives about the day and hour that we're living well what we're doing would you can you come up okay wait a minute March and they convinced me they need to go fishing so I and the car daddy to ask him if he would come with him and daddy said he didn't feel like it poppin tell him to go fishing with us so I can't pop in Papa said he would he came I got the boys went fishing left mama with us came back brought the boys back he didn't come in mama went out and got in the car and he went home and dropped I believe it I know what he told somebody else had told me he said I enjoyed going to church at Lula won't have any time other than back under and going to jail he was a good old brother a good man he was a wonderful fella you know what years ago the Lord told me missus don't a it's been on record for years that God would send some people from Athens Georgia to be a part of this group they have many of them come but the dawn again was one that he told me my brother Donnie come he said brother Dale he said I think I was done wrong and I need to repent and get straight but he said I think I need to go get baptized he said I'm going to Jeffersonville and get baptized great praise the Lord brother that's what you need go do it few days later he came back and he said brother Dale I've been thinking about it he said the same God it's in Jeffersonville Indiana is in a Lula Georgia he said will you baptize me I said yes sir there's only one person that he spoke to me about has it come that's Betty Cunningham she's it a nursing home I've seen him work too much to not be concerned I just don't talk about it because see that gets you building well I'm the brother bill have you seen this is no don't get into all that let's just get into God's Word and just tell what God says to you you know it's any problem any problem we're saying the Lord showed me this or the Lord showed me they have does that make us see that no it makes a good god we've seen a lot of the miracles and the signs and wonders from the dead raised the sick yield of all forms sure we need more of God but I am satisfied where I'm at you may not believe but I'm satisfied in the position that God has brought me and put me to the place of understanding I know he'll curious own because he promised it well can't we just depend upon his promises I'm shouted glory for the victory or the restoration that he promised because we got to get the restoration right then you can talk about the things that are not dealing with restoration but are dealing with the spoken word those seals to me is the headstone to the church I'll always believe that you know why because God spoke through a man the secret things that no man has ever understood is that not according to the logos the speech the things you don't ever think about we talk about the faith of the fathers and how those people learn their word they brought you realize they did now nobody to study over it and to talk about it and get it straight now God spoke to him and they pinned it down and that is the Word of God what a day Father be with us on the way home take care of everybody give a safe journey thank you for touching the floor and just have your way with each one now that's your light shine into our hearts we love you in Jesus name Amen you dismiss [Music]
