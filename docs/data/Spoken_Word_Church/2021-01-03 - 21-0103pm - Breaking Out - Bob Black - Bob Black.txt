wasn't that a good service this morning we were sitting out there talking in the car about somebody said brother dale broke it down this morning and i believe he did that was that was really good i appreciate that word so this afternoon i just want to read uh uh from first peter chapter 5 verses 8 to 10. and we do have many things to be thankful for don't we in this hour thankful to be able to come together and worship among believers of life precious faith and to be able to look into his word and so much to be thankful for these days let's go to the lord in prayer before we look into the word lord jesus we're so thankful to be able to come together this afternoon lord jesus and we pray god that this gathering won't be in vain lord but that your spirit will come and anoint the word lord jesus anoint my lips to speak the truth anoint the ears of the here lord to receive lord and anoint this service lord jesus that you'll have preeminence little god and we open up the doors of our heart to you lord god that you can come and dwell and tabernacle with us and and and fellowship with us this afternoon and we pray lord that you'll just be with us and accept our invitation we ask these things in your name amen so i want to speak on a little topic called breaking out of breaking out of your shell and and again you know how i like to do is just kind of take a little message and break it down and so what what i'm what i'm going to be speaking on this afternoon is the greatest battle ever fought and just to call out some some things maybe just kind of point out some things in that message that brother brown said so when you when you get alone and and you want to just kind of meditate on some things maybe go back and listen to that message and think about um that god has given us the recipe in this hour to overcome but there's something we got to do so let's read and uh brother branham actually read two scriptures when he was when he was reading uh when he preached this sermon i'm just going to read the first one and that's first peter chapter 5 verses 8-10 and he said be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil the adversary of the devil many times we think that our adversary is is people that go to church with us or the minister or our boss and all kinds of things but or maybe the president the president is your adversary the president is not your adversary because you know to be able to fight your adversary correctly you've got to know who your adversary is you've got to know if if the president is your adversary then you would be able to fight him by being a republican or democrat or join the right party but if you know your adversary is the devil then you can know and understand how to defeat the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the face in the faith do you know you can resist the devil many times we go through life and we forget that we can resist the devil resist steadfast fast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect established strengthen settle you my what a promise and what a blessing you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strength and settle you after you have suffered a while so you know brother brown when he as he was preaching this message the greatest battle ever fought maybe one thing to kind of point out is that you have to fight a battle you remember when in the israelites when they went into the promised land in the old testament they crossed over the river and they got into the promised land and and they thought maybe maybe in their mind it's just going to be a bed of roses but as soon as they crossed over then now they've got they've got the city of jericho and they've got to drive out all the moabites and the amorites and it turned in there was a battle that they had to fight and you've got to fight a battle to get every inch of ground every again every promise of god that god has given to you he's laid out all these promises but you can't just sit on your uh in your chair in your easy chair and expect everything to be handled handed to you everything is a battle so we are in a battle and we're warring against the devil now now brother branham as he preached this sermon he called out at the beginning of this message he said and and this is maybe the the crux of the whole message is that a devil is almost harmless until he can have something to work in he's got to have something to work in and he said you remember those devils that were cast out of legion they had they they wanted to do more mischievous so they wanted to go in the hogs you remember that story how when jesus cast out the devils from legion they said let us they didn't want to just go out of the of the person but they wanted to go into something so that they could continue to cause mischief they wanted to go into the hogs and then they ran those hogs down into the sea once they got in the hogs and that's the same way that the devils will do any person once they get inside of you and begin to work in your life then they will run you down into the ground they'll destroy your life we've seen so many evidences of that people in hollywood showing up in the in the magazines that you read in the store of their lives and wrecks and ruins people that you know because once the devil gets a hold of you he'll just run run you right down into the ground just like he he ran those hogs and he said brother brown said see so devils must have something to work in somebody to work through now now so we were actually talking about that recently what if you were out in the middle of the arctic or what if you went to alaska would you still be able to get the coronavirus if you're not away from anybody if you're away from everybody would you still be able to get sick would you still be able to get all the different kind of diseases see the devil's got to have somebody to work through and that's how he goes from one person even even with coals and flus and all those kind of things he's got to go from one person to another person the devil's got to have somebody to work through now now wouldn't it be wonderful to be able to find the secret to the devil would not be able to work through you you know brother brahma said that's a promise in the message that you can get so close to god and to the devil's just kind of walking around how can i what can i do to this person no matter what i do to this person no matter what i say what kind of thoughts i put in their mind they're resistant to me they're resistant to anything that i say anything that i throw at them i can't do anything to them and so there's a promise in the message that you can somebody's going to come to that place where the devil can't do anything to them that's a promise in the message somebody now it might only be like a handful of people as brother brown alluded to and many times as it was in the days of noah where only eight souls were saved and then he would type it to enoch and it was only one one to eight so maybe just a few people but somebody somebody is going to come to a place where the devil can't do anything to you so we're in a battle we're in a battle and and and the devil is trying to find somebody to work through but you see also god is trying to work finding somebody to work through you think about two and satan in the millennium brother brown said he would be bound by chains of circumstance and the circumstances are that there would be nobody for him to work through in the millennium nobody that he could find to work through until the end of that millennium and then you have the battle of gog and magog when he's loosed for just a little bit of season so brother brahma says one night he says what drew me to the conclusion here as and the beginning of this sermon as he as he's speaking he says i was standing with brother wood and brother sotheman now now now pay attention to how he kind of lays the framework to the greatest battle ever fall he begins to look to the heavens and he begins to look to the stars and he says i was standing with brother wood and brother soffman it was about 10 o'clock at night and i was looking up towards the sky and a great all came over me and i said just look all that great heavenly host and i said everything is perfectly in harmony and you think you think now thousands of years ago in the days of enoch and and uh early on and and and you know four or five thousand years ago you'd be able to look up into the sky and actually see the milky way and all of its glory and all those kind of things and and they would look to the skies brother brown said that was god's first bible and the sky would tell the story of redemption and and now now you go out into the night sky and and when we go out at night where we live we look up and the the lights of man the man-made lights have kind of dimmed the night sky and you can't really see it the way that they could see it back then i really wish that we could but if you could you know they they were so in tuned with the way that the sky looked and the position of all the planets and everything's that the magi were even so they they knew when something special was coming on the earth because they could see the alignment of those of those planets and the star they they knew that exactly where it was going to be happening and they followed that star to jerusalem but the lights have become in that isn't that the same way that the lights of the tree of knowledge that that light of knowledge has dimmed in this day in this hour the light of the gospel but yet there's still a little shining light brother i'm saying remember when he drew out the seven church edges he said i left a little light because it had gotten so dark but yet there's still a little light left but see he was looking up at the sky to see the great harmony that god had put into place how the sun and the moon and all the planets in their position were in harmony and knew their position and knew knew what they were supposed to be doing we'll kind of put it like that knew knew their place and they were in their place and they were accomplishing a purpose and he said brother brown said in that whole great mass of millions and billions of light years god sits in the midst of all of it and he looks down and he said paul is in there my mother's in there somewhere looking down now now what does he mean if that is god's first bible and you your name is written in the the bible that we read what about in that first bible now we know that that brother brown said the way that you were supposed to read that first bible is is it started with virgo and ended up in leo now we don't have maybe there's a lot of missing pieces anywhere but we know that if you look at that at the constellations the correct way what they're spelling out is the redemptive story that god came by a virgin and he came and manifested in the earth like like brother dale was breaking out this morning and and and all the way down to when he would return and return as a roaring lion and and so i believe that if you could look at it in the right way you would see all the bride and all the people of god reflected in that great story in the sky and so brother branham was talking about how that you can see god in the midst holding everything together putting everything together in a way that everything moves in harmony because god is in the midst and he's saying what if what if our lives could be like that what if our what if we could reflect that bible in the heavens what if we could if god was so in the midst of the church to where everything moved in harmony and we were in one accord what would that church look like what would our lives what would our lives look like and he said i thought of the order of that heavenly host not one of them is out of place everyone keeps its time perfectly god's great army i thought of the soldiers how that if that moon would happen to get out of order the earth would be covered again with water just in a few minutes they all set in place and if there's a moving anywhere of them it's for cause and will affect this earth now can't you see the bride's purpose reflected in those statements that every move of the bride is for a cause every action that you take is for a cause and he's saying it will affect this earth do you know when the bride speaks when when the bride makes a movement it will cause an effect in this earth when you take a hold of god's word it will affect your earth just the same as the moon moving through its orbit affects the earth affects the movement of the water from one side of the earth to the other because what you're reflecting the word of god you are the interpretation of the word of god just as those things those planets in orbit are showing forth the great magnificence of god's word in harmony moving in harmony with his word he said we just see the results of it now but some of them moving into their other spots it's effective it affects everything my goodness you think about how every little small planet every little moving of an asteroid or whatever affects something and there's not one believer here sitting here this afternoon that doesn't affect the bride of christ you have a place that you're you have a place and a purpose sitting here in this church you have a place and a purpose in your home your little housewives going home making your biscuits there's a purpose in your life because everything that you do has a purpose brother brown said the celestial objects were in their place they know their place and i want to just point out that the celestial objects could not be affected by they're not affected by satan's doing they're not affected by no fear or no hysteria and so you see let me just point this out now this this we're living in a time now where there's so much hysteria going on in the earth everybody's so affected by the by sickness and by by death and things and you can get into a place of hysteria but i believe god's word will bring us to a place of confidence of stillness like that promise that we were reading that after ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you will settle you down to where you know your god and the bible says that they that though their god will do great exploits will come to a place where you don't fear and brother brahman said as he was breaking all these things down he said that same god is here the same god that can keep the planets in orbit the same god that can keep the sun in the right place they could put this earth three planets away from the sun because there's life on it they can arrange everything in just a harmonious way because everything in the celestials has a plan and purpose that same god is here and he says what's he waiting on he's waiting the only thing that he's waiting for is for his army to get their position like the stars get the position all right now now let's highlight that for a second because so many times in our carnal imagination of what the what the gospel is really about we believe that what we're doing here is we're waiting on god to do something but see god has already i i i luis i was marco polo me the other night and i was staying up we were going back and forth because i was i was going through what brother dale had been preaching on the seals and i was staying up the other night and and i saw where i i i i was reading some things about now i lost my train of thought anyway that happens sometimes anyway god is we're not waiting on god to do something oh i remember what it was now that after after after six seals were preached there's nothing else can be said six seals are preached and there's nothing else can be said and so so there's nothing the message has already been preached that's my point the message that message has already been preached and now now what is what are we waiting on god to preach to send another another messenger are we waiting on another message to be preached what we're waiting on we're god is waiting on us to do something with us he's the only thing that he is waiting for us is to get in position and how do you get in position by by the word how do you even know what your position is how do you so like a young person would say well i feel like i'm supposed to be called to be a minister i want to be a minister well how do you know what to preach without the word you can't preach if you don't know what the word is how can you preach this message if you don't know what the message is so get in the message get in the word and then you'll have something to preach then you'll have something to do now now brother adam said the the point of this message is there's two powers there's two powers and there's there's the devil is trying to get control of you and god is trying to get control of you and whichever one has control of you is the is the thing that you've given over to now brother brown said there's only two powers and there's only two kingdoms two powers and two kingdoms all the rest the little minor things are connected with either one of those powers and those powers is god's power and satan's power and he goes on he says one of the other power is going to control us so let's cast out the evil one and let's take our position like the stars of the heaven and and then he goes on and he says and we don't want to be wandering stars like jude spoke of wonder if this is right wonder if that's right wonder if it will happen wonder how it could be do you know that this gospel has given us the antidote to confusion with this message if you get in the message you don't have an excuse for being confused anymore the reason that people are confused is because that they don't get into the message to find out what the prophet said and then they wander from one church to the other wondering what is the truth wondering if people are telling the truth what the gospel really is how do i get the holy ghost how do i know whether i'm really born again or not but brother and i'm saying don't be wondering stars you know maybe there's they're stars if you look into the heavens that are just shooting from place to place and they're not in a particular position but there's you want to be like those stars that are in a position that are rooted and grounded and settled and have a place and a purpose not just something shooting around shooting off not knowing what you're doing don't don't be like one of the stars that that maybe at the end of your journey you look back and say what was i even doing what was what was my life for but your life has a purpose and if you get in christ you'll find out what that purpose is and your purpose is to manifest his word for this day now brother brown says when an army makes ready and he nails down all the different criteria of an army having to get ready all the different steps and stages he says they should first sit down and figure out what's right and wrong and whether they're able to go against the next nation or not he says jesus taught that and then the soldiers have to be selected and they've got to be dressed for fighting and then they've got to be trained for fighting and a battleground has to be selected for the battle to take place now now think about all these things have to do with the word the soldiers being selected you're being selected there's a selection process going on when you come to church and you hear the preaching of the gospel if you respond to that gospel call then you have been selected if your ears open up if the gospel looses that bind that bond that the devil has you under and your eyes become open to the truth then you have been selected you've been received into the army of the lord and then you see you want to sit down first though and figure out what's right and wrong and so that's why it's so important to discern what's right and what's the the true truth from the false now this is what brother wade's been been been preaching on so long that that you've got to be able to discern the two spirits that is and maybe i want to just nail down the practical application of that tonight because if you can't discern between the two spirits the true and the false that are in the church how are you going to know how to respond how are you going to know what you're supposed to be fighting for or against now now brother brown the example that he uses is when general custer made his fatal mistake now now i know we've all heard this before we listened to the message before but let's pay real close attention to what he points out when he's telling this story of general custer making his fatal mistake what was general custer's fatal mistake he said general kuster as i understand had orders from the government he had orders not to go into the land of the sioux indian he had orders don't go into the land of the suit so there's his first mistake he disobeyed the orders because it was a religious time for them it was a time of worship they were having a feast but custer got drunk and he thought that he would just do it anyhow he's rebellious he's just got i'm going to do it anyhow nobody going to tell me what to do he would cross whether it was orders or not orders and then they actually shot some innocent men shot at them now there's custer's fatal mistake he was unable to discern who was innocent and who was guilty so he shot an innocent man now you see if you don't have discernment you'll go to a church and you'll shoot the innocent man saying they're not preaching right when they're preaching the absolute truth of the message if you don't know if you're unable to discern you'll think you're doing right when you're doing wrong that's why you must take a step back and discern whether it is right or false you've got to discern the truth first or you'll be shooting an innocent man he said he shot at them i i think they hit some of them it was scouts but out hunting for food to feed their people while they were in worship my goodness i think how many people in the message of the hour around the message have done the same thing shot people that were there in worship trying to feed their people shot ministers of the gospel that were trying to feed people that were in worship and they and they talk about bad about them behind their back and they do all these things and say i'm not going to listen to that i'm not going to go to that church anymore and all those kind of things because they were unable to discern the truth from the false now see let me pause for a second because i know sometimes when you get to preaching like this people will say brother bob doesn't like me or brother bob's talking about certain things but see i am only reading what the prophet said in this message go back to the greatest battle ever fought and see whether i am only reading what he said or not so don't get mad at me get mad at the prophet for exposing things he said and that was the end of general custer because he didn't sit down and think first he didn't sit down and think first he had no business there he had no right to be there he had pushed the indians from the east coast all the way across the west anyhow and they had a treaty but he broke the treaty and when he broke the treaty then he lost the battle so you must be able to discern the truth from the false now now let me read this quote that brother wade has been reading and that is so important to the bride of christ and the church age book where brother said now remember this christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless so that's maybe a first step at discerning because the devil wants the church to be lukewarm formal and powerless what's lukewarm lukewarm is is where you're not really on fire for god you come to church and you just kind of you well it's another service i don't really want to read my bible this week i don't i don't really i don't understand anything and you just get become lukewarm you're going through the motions but you're not on fire for god and formal formal if you look up the definition of formal is where you've got to do everything by the set of rules that a governing body says that you've got to do it by if it's not done remember when jesus would raise the dead on the sabbath or he would do a miracle on the sabbath and the pharisees and the sadducees would say it's not according to our rules it's not done by the way that we think you should be doing it you've got to do it the way we say and but jesus was breaking their formal tradition he got out of their formal rule book for when you when you begin to get into your formal rule book and everything has got to be done the uh by by this structure then you you begin to squelch the spirit of the living god what if god calls you like philip to go witness to somebody over there and and it's it doesn't fall within the structure that you think it should and and powerless the devil wants to make the church lukewarm formal and powerless and what did brother branham say the power was the power is in the revelation of the word of god so when you deny the power thereof you're denying the word that is being preached from the pulpit that will give you power to overcome the devil and you that's exactly what the devil wants the church to be he wants the antichrist spirit wants you to be lukewarm formal and powerless so now you begin a step toward being able to discern if the devil wants you to just just uh have just a slack christian experience and not on fire and and not understanding what's being preached and not have a personal revelation of jesus christ for yourself that's getting to a place exactly where the devil wants you to be but the bride of christ will not be like that she will be able to discern and withstand that religious spirit now brother brown said in that quote he said it exposes satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army now isn't that what brother brown was talking about and the greatest battle ever fought the god is selecting soldiers he's training up an army he's getting them clothed right so they have the right dressing so they have the right army and then he's giving them the ability to discern the what they're fighting and to know what they're fighting and to know the tricks of the enemy brother brahman said in in the message all things he said the holy spirit warned us that in the last days that the church would get away from the sincerity and the faith they'd have a form of godliness but would deny the power that went with the right thing having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof yes sir god hates a powerless religion and any religion today that hasn't got christ in it is powerless but any religion that christ is in that christ in is under his blood and it's got power in it you say god hates a religion without power he said your solemn feast is a stink now now we think of power a lot of times as being able to get real loud be getting real loud but jesus was able to cast out devils without raising his voice the bible says that that you didn't hear his voice in this in the street he didn't he wasn't like a screaming preacher or anything he had but he had a revelation of who he was and what his purpose was and what he was doing there and that was the power that he had within him to overcome the enemy until the devil the devil tempted him three times and said cast you off this building turn these stones in the bread all the different things that he tempted him with and jesus didn't respond with loud noises but he responded with the word and that is how you will overcome the devil in this day now brother brown said there are two spirits trying to operate two spirits trying to find vessels and you can resist the devil in james chapter 4 7 it says submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you you know the devil has been tormenting so many people in the bride he's been tormenting so many people today and and i i want to just encourage you that you have been predestinated and called out by the message of the hour to torment the devil the devil is tormenting you but you have been called out to torment the devil and if you will resist the devil the bible says that he will flee from you he will get so fed up with trying to mess with you that he'll flee from you now of course he's going to come back a little bit later but that doesn't mean that you can't resist him again you just keep resisting him and how do you resist him the same way that jesus resisted the devil by the word it is written it is written it is written it is written that all things are possible to them that believe it is written that he will never leave you or forsake you it is written that he is with you all the time he's always he's a present help in time of need and in time of trouble he's a prison help it's written all these things it's written forget not all thy benefits my soul forget don't forget all god's benefits that he's a healer he's your healer he's your savior don't forget he gave the promise that if you're seeking the holy ghost the promise is under you and until your children and to as many as their fall far off even as many as the lord our god shall call the promise is to you and it's written it's written that god is able of these stones to rise up children unto abraham it's written and you can when you quote god's promises you that is how you defeat the devil by speaking god's word back to him now you see so so we've gone through all the requirement all the different things that god is doing as he prepares an army and and there's got to be a common meeting ground a common place where the battle can rage now maybe just to kind of illustrate this think of it in your mind about how when the israelites and the philistines met and david went over to the israelites to bring his family some bread at what night he looked down in the valley and there in the common meeting place was goliath making his bold threats and david said is there not anybody that's willing to go up against this goliath and so he was willing to go down into the common meeting place and do battle so first before you do battle you've got to you've got to be equipped right you've got to be trained right you've got to be able to tell the enemy and then you go into the common meeting place and what brother branham say the common meeting place where the battle rages is in your mind he said when this great battle started on earth there had to be a mutual meeting place now y'all don't go to sleep hang on i know a lot this is a a lot of background for a lot of people but some maybe haven't heard this before and i'm getting to a point here so just hang on with me for a little bit longer he said when this great battle started on earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that battlegrounds began in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was beginning that is because that decisions are made from the mind the head and he goes on to say decisions are made in the head there's where satan meets you and the decisions are because that god made a man that way now think think about that that god god did not make you to be a robot but he put in you the facility to choose this way or that way to say i agree with what that preacher is saying or i do not agree and there is the battleground the battleground in the old testament was they would take up uh stones and slay goliath that way they would take david took his sword and cut goliath's head off but the battleground now is you don't take up a sword you're taking up the sword of the word and you're doing battle that way you're taking up the shield of faith and the helmet of salvation and your feet are tr are shot with the gospel of peace and you've got your clothes right so that you can do battle and you take up that sword and you you lop off the enemy's head with it you can cut him and slice him with it and you see what that looks like is in practice as the preacher is preaching along and you can either your faith will either build and build and build as a service progresses by the preaching of the god of the gospel or you will reject it and reject it and get colder and colder and go further away because you have within yourself the faculty to either accept or reject the word as it's being preached brother brown said your womb of your spirit is your mind your mind is a channel you've got five senses that controls the body you've got five senses that controls the soul consciousness so forth now now this is where he's kind of flip-flopping the labels a little bit but he always talked five senses to the outside five senses to the inner realm one sense to the inner rim to the inside realm but he flops the label sometimes early on in his ministry now your body see there's taste filled smelling here but there's only one channel to the inside of that soul show that you are a seed your soul body and spirit and then the one channel avenue one way into that your own free moral agency that is you can receive or reject you do whatever you want to therefore evil's on the same basis she could take god's word and say god said not to do it and get away from here now now the reason i believe that he talks about eve is because now eve if adam and eve were one and then eve was taken out of adam's side and adam god breathed as brother brother dale was bringing out this morning in blasphemous names that god breathed eternal life into adam's soul so there you've got e adam and eve both with eternal life and yet now now this is the point just because you're born again does not mean you're turned into a robot well you're born again you can have eternal life down in your soul and god is not forcing you to to go home and read the bible he's not forcing you it's still a battle to come to church it's still a battle when you get up in the morning and you say i got a headache i just want to stay home and i just want to lay in the bed all day or whatever it is it's still going to be a battle you still got battles and that's why it's the greatest battle ever fought because you've got a battle in your mind it's going to be a battle when you get up in the morning and the kids are pulling every which way and and maybe you and your wife have a little spat on the way to church and it's a battle because the devil wants you to just be slack and be lazy and stay at home and not come to church but something on the inside will be pushing i gotta get that word i'm gonna be a little jacob and i'm going to get that word if it kills me if i have to beg bar to steal i'm going to get that word if i have to if i have to be a little shyster almost i'm going to have to i'm going to get it that's the kind of christian you got to be you got to be willing to get laid everything aside to get that word and somebody tells you i i wouldn't go listen to i wouldn't go listen to that preacher or whatever maybe maybe it's time to go check it out because like a little jacob you want that word above everything else you see you see when somebody says i just i just don't know about going to church all the time i just it makes you question whether the right thing is down on the inside because if you've got that real genuine boring and soul down on the inside you're going to be wanting that word above everything else you want that word because it's what gives you power over the devil you want that word because that's what's taking you closer and closer to the headstone you want that word because it is what gives you strength and feeds you now brother brown said if this church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be in one accord with not one shadow of doubt anywhere there would not be a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes there will not be nobody here desiring the holy ghost but what would receive it if you could just get that certain thing fixed now there is where the battle begins or ride in your mind whether you will now see that's where the battle is the battle is you're sitting here and you maybe you're battling with what i'm saying your body you've got all these quotes that are coming up and you're thinking well he didn't say exactly the way i remember and all these things and you're battling but see brother branham is saying if you can get the flus cleared out so that you're thinking right and you're meditating right and you're receiving the word and you're accepting it and the way that it's being preached and the way that it should be he said in another five minutes there wouldn't be nobody here desiring the holy ghost but what would receive it my goodness so how do you get the holy ghost how do you get the holy ghost you believe god's word all right you just accept it you just accept it now isn't that what a preacher's role is in a marriage the preacher comes up and the man and the wife come forward and he says is there anybody is there any reason why these can't be married is there any there's no doubt there's no they're believing they're doing right and see a minister a minister is actually performing a wedding ceremony even as you're seated here if you believe it there's no reason if the old man is dead if the old man you've been baptized and that old man is dead and there's no reason why you can't be married then just accept it just accept it and it will begin to be manifested in your life but but brother bob i got to go i got to do all these things i got to go do some novenas or whatever whatever else you think and and the uh you whatever your interpretation of the message is no the gospel is as simple as just accept it as is presented just believe because it is the birth of the word the word is what will give you power over the enemy and when you receive it then the holy spirit will come and anoint it now see that's another thing that brother brown brings out in the greatest battle ever fall the devil wants you to believe his lie so he can anoint that god wants you to believe the truth so he can anoint the truth and the devil wants you to believe his lie so he can anoint the lie so he can anoint it with that spirit of unbelief there's a spirit of truth and that is the spirit of christ and the spirit of unbelief is the spirit of the devil the spirit of the antichrist and both of those spirits are trying to anoint you even as you're seated here right in the church right now both of those spirits are trying to anoint the people the spirit of god is trying to anoint you and what is preventing that spirit from anointing you is that you won't believe and the spirit of the of the antichrist is trying to annoy his people too and when you accept a lie over the truth then he can come and anoint see overcoming power doesn't come by overcoming power doesn't come by people deep being nice to me and liking me that's a lot and this and this message brother ram said he said people think that coming to church is like being you want to be a good person and that's where people get so hung up so many times we want to come to church so that we can feel liked and loved and that's part of it part of the christian experience part of coming to church is showing love to one another being a lie to the world and all those things but just having people like you will not give you a home in heaven being comfortable and being well respected and being in the spotlight and having first place those are not the secret to overcoming the secret is what jesus said in matthew chapter 18. when he said and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven to come into as a little child into the sanctuary of the lord and say teach me i'm willing to hear and do if you tell me if you tell me that i need to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ i'm going to go do it because you're a little child a little child just you tell a little child to do something and he's like he's just god has got his little bowl full empty empty holding it out ready to be filled give it to me and i'll do whatever you tell me to do in luke chapter 10 verse 21 it says in that hour jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes and brother brown would always quote that as unto babes such as would learn babes such as would learn even so far therefore it seemed good in thy sight a babe such as would learn a babe that will learn as somebody that will lay their pride down that will lay their ego down and say i'm willing to listen to what you have to say i'm willing to listen to the gospel priest i'm willing to see what this is all about that will just lay it down and accept it as a little child that's why the book of revelation says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith under the churches if you've got an ear to hear like a little child if you're willing to just listen if you can open up your ear and listen then then you will have that promise to him that overcometh him that overcometh is the promise to him that will hear that him that will just listen and be willing to be tall and willing to receive instruction do you know even in the book of revelation the word beast is trans the original word beast in the greek is the word theorem which means a wild or untamable beast a kind of beast that cannot be instructed the kind of beast that cannot be taught and we don't want to be that kind of beast we want to be a gentle lamb that's willing to be led willing to be instructed willing to have somebody say you're doing wrong and you need to go this way or maybe you think the new birth is like this but it's really like this you think let me say it like this you might think that the new birth is just feeling a presence feeling something all of a sudden and you didn't believe nothing but you just got in church and you felt something you felt a cold trickle down your back but that's not the new birth the new birth is when you've gone through a process of justification sanctification and a sanctification you pack the word in just like that middle rim and the tabernacle you sit there at that table of showbread and you pack that word and you study and you sit there trying to keep the lamps lit as they go out and they get foggy and dim and you sit there and lit it up until the holy spirit comes and anoints the word that you've held in your heart and makes it come alive and that's a new birth that's the baptism in the holy ghost when the when the spirit comes and quickens the word that you have held in your heart not just coming into church to our sensation not just coming to be amongst a group of people so that you can feel important or something but when the word of god is quickened by the holy spirit you've got to hear the word and receive it to be born again you've got to receive the word in your soul you've got to hear it and receive it and hang on to it hang on until something happens do you know that's what they did on the day of pentecost brother brown said they said well we already got it and peter or somebody rose up and said no there's a promise something's gonna happen now that we're hanging on to the word jesus said it was coming now let's wait until it comes and the holy spirit came and quickened that word well holy spirit the spirit that i'm talking about that's trying to quicken the word now if you'll receive it you see there's two spirits again there's a spirit of the antichrist that will quicken a lie that will anoint a lie and the spirit of truth the spirit of christ that will come and rest upon like a dove upon the word like like that dove coming down upon the word on the on the river jordan that wants to come down upon that word and quicken it and make it come to life do you believe that we're after a word birth not just a feeling or a sensation but something down on the inside that will give you confidence in this hour something that will give you a discernment to be able to know the truth from the false something that will give you give you a real genuine birth and that is the word if you will receive the worth the word for this day god will birth himself inside of you brother brother said in perfect faith he said we are taught to resist the devil and he will flee from us now to resist is to just simply turn him down just resist him that is just walk away from it god said a certain thing no matter what he's trying to tell you you don't even listen to him your ears are deaf to anything else but what the spirit says to he that has an ear that listens see what the spirit sayeth unto the churches the one that's god the listening post that catches what the spirit says to the churches if you've got that listening post down on the inside of your heart like the radio tower he's talking about a radio tower then you'll be able to hear what the spirit is saying to the churches if you don't have the listening post then all it sounds like is a bunch of clapping thunder that's why you begin to wonder what's going on in church and what the real revelation of the hour is and that's why there's so much confusion i believe because people don't have ears to hear they're not listening the right way you got to have the listening post so that you can hear what's being said if you've got that listening post you won't be confused but you know somebody somebody is going to learn how to turn down the devil now listen listen to this satan is trying to work through you through a word a lie he's trying to tell you like he told eve to give a word that's it's like twist one word off until it's twisted and then he'll give that to you that god is giving you his word the truth and the devil twisted a little bit and he wants to give that to you now before it can be spoken though it's a thought and many times the devil the devil will come first to you with a thought now what he might be attacking you with right now is a thought i don't know if that's true i don't know if that's right or or not just me preaching but any minister when you're listening to brother brown i'm like what did he mean by that i when he says in the statue of a perfect man that you've gone all this way and you still don't have the holy ghost yet well what did he mean and you begin to the the enemy will come and try to twist that and everything but you see somebody is going to learn how to turn down the devil while it's a thought while it's a thought before it even becomes a word while it's just a thought in your mind and you'll say you can't work through me i'm not going to listen to that i'm not going to listen to that lie against one of my brothers or sisters i'm not going to listen to that lie against somebody i'm not going to listen to that lie against the word where you're saying that that i'm gonna fail i'm afraid look how much of a failure you are i listen to that because god says greater is he that is in me that he is in the world i'm not listening to all those lies about how my my children are going to be lost to anything i ain't listening to that because there's a promise in his word it says contrary that this promise is unto you and your children i listen in another lies of the devil there's going to be somebody that will not listen to anything that the devil has to say listen when you don't put that when you don't listen to anything the devil has to say you put the devil out of a job when the devil can't use your thoughts and he can't use your voice and he can't use your body then the devil's out of a job and i want to put the devil out of a job tonight i want to put the devil out of a job so he's he's put out in the church out of our homes out of our lives so he can't come in and mess with our young people anymore mess with our old people when he comes and tries to put something in your head you just say i ain't listening i don't care because you know really the only way that you can do that that you've been is if you've been packing the word in and you've been packing the word and until you know what the word is and when you know what the word is and you know when something is one word off listen brother brother brown said the mind accepts the life which is the word of god now listen to this this is how the gospel works and it's contrary to half the stuff that's preached in the message if people would go listen to what the message is they find out how to get the new birth and how to grow in grace and knowledge and how to get the capstone he says the mind accepts the life which is the word of god and there brings the life just your thought doesn't do it but the word of god brought in the channel of your thought see it's not the thought that's christian science make it mind over matter that's that isn't it but your mind accepts it it grasps it what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the word of god and that's the thing that god that's got life in it the word of god jesus said my words our spirit and their life my words my words will actually give you life if you'll listen to my words you can have life and if you'll receive his word it will sanctify you sanctify them father by by thy truth my word is truth his word is what will cleanse you his word is what will give you life his word is what will change you that is how you tell the true and the false by his word that is how you get born again by his word his word is what will do it he said your mind accepts it grasp it your spirit catches the word of god and that's the thing that's got life in it it brings life into you when that takes place when life comes down that channel into you the word of god is manifested in you if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it'll be done for you then what does that do from the middle of the heart which is the soul from there goes forth feeding every channel the trouble of it is we're standing in here with a lot of doubt trying to accept what's out there you've got to stop that and come down that channel with the true word of god and then it goes out itself automatically it's what's on the inside that's the thing that's why jesus told nicodemus except you be born you must be born again be born again how by feeling a sensation or or seeing the pillar of fire we want so many times we want supernatural evidences but what greater evidence could there be than a revelation of jesus christ personally to you brother branham said in questions and answers 1959 he said the earth is full of the spirit of god but it's poured out it cannot operate until it comes into us we human beings to operate now think about that the earth is full of the spirit of god is poured out on all flesh but it can't operate into us until we human beings it can't operate until it comes into us we human beings to operate how does it get into you by you believing the word of god and is that just that simple and the devil wants to take us over to operate under him so he gets the mild form he starts in sin if he can hold them just a righteous man a good man and just let him go ahead and try to be good like that now see this is what the devil wants to do with you if he can hold him like that until he's dead that's just what he wants to do is to get a man in a predicament where he thinks he's a good good righteous man he's just a good churchgoer and just hold him like that until he's dead then that's what the devil wants to do with you and that's where brother brown tells the story of the chicken the eagle and the egg now let's let's really think about this when you're in an egg every one of this us when we started our christian journey you were in an eggshell it's like you're in an egg and that's where i get my title from breaking out of the shell the devil puts a cloak of blindness over your eyes so you think you're okay and you think you're all right you might be even coming to church and you might be doing going through the motions and everything you might have even been baptized but you didn't receive the word just right and you're sitting there in your eggshell you're sitting there in the egg and brother brown said one day one day you get tired of being in that egg you realize there's you're not supposed to be in that eggshell you're not supposed you're not where you're supposed to be and something on the inside begins to working and you begin to peck out now let's see how brother around says how you peck out we know he talked about the chicken the chicken picking out but how do you peck out that's what i want to know how to get out of the eggshell so whatever whatever your shell is it might be that you need to be born again or it might need be that you need to be birthed from faith to virtue it might be that you need to be birthed from brotherly kindness into the capstone but then whatever your shell is you got to do something and one of the things you got to do is you got to realize you got to come to the revelation by the preaching of the gospel that you're not where you're supposed to be that you're stuck inside of a shell and you know in the bible in second kings chapter 3 it tells about how with samaria was besieged by syria and there was these two lepers that were sitting there in the gate and they came to the realization what are we doing sitting by this gate and they rose up from their place and they said if we go forward we're going to die we might die if we go back we're going to die because we're lepers and we're starving and there's something wrong we're not in our right place and so they went down to find that god had already conquered the battle for them that they didn't have to do nothing god had already fought the battle and won and all they had to do was pick up the spoils and if you come to that realization that you there's something that you need to do you'll find out that god has already fought the battle for you and won and all you have to do is pick up the spoil all you have to do is receive the blessings they said they says there were four leprous men of the entering into the gate and they said one to another why sit here why sit here we here until we die because you see you've got to make up in your mind that you're coming out you've got to set in your mind that's why brother brown preached that sermon desperation because you get to a place where you become desperate i am coming out of this eggshell i'm coming out i don't care if nobody around me is getting the holy ghost i am going to get it i don't care if nobody around me believes that you got to come to the capstone i'm believing what brother branham said about it and i'm coming i'm going all the way somebody is going to believe so far that the devil won't be able to do nothing with you and i'm going to be that one that's the kind of person that's going to accept that's going to step into all the promises that's going to walk into the promises of god and you see what what causes that eggshell to hatch to be in the right atmosphere right if you take if you take somebody that's been impregnated by the word of god that's been let's receive the word and you put them in the right atmosphere the songs begin to be sung and their mind begins to meditate on the scripture and the channel begins to open up and they begin to say i i accept the word i accept my healing now i accept the promise of god that god is going to fill me with the holy ghost because he's spoken and i believe that where it's written that written promises for me something is going to happen because you see brother brown said the atmosphere is your attitude toward the word the atmosphere atmosphere is not what you feel it's your attitude towards the word do you know you can create an atmosphere you can create an atmosphere by speaking the word when you say i believe it i believe it that's creating an atmosphere when you sit there and you say i receive it that's creating an atmosphere the atmosphere will hatch the egg that is what will cause that little chicken or that little eagle to come forth with that egg when you say i believe it i know it's true you see the wrong you can be in the wrong atmosphere the wrong atmosphere is when you say well i might fail when you begin to say well it might not be right what that preacher is saying when you begin to say i i don't think the preacher likes me or i i don't think he said that right that's that's the wrong atmosphere or i don't like the way this service is going that's the wrong atmosphere but when you begin to say i believe that that is the right atmosphere and it'll hatch it'll hatch if you're in a denominational surface it'll hatch if you're it doesn't matter where it'll hatch in the middle of a cornfield it'll hatch in the middle of a muddy spot in the field it'll hatch because you're coming with the right approach i believe god's word they see you got to get desperate when you get begin to get to a place where you say i am not satisfied where i am that something is beginning to move brother said you throw everything aside and open up the channel and say god your word is eternally true and it's for me if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet i can't fail because i'm taking your word there's the battle listen listen to how the little chick comes out he comes out by his mouth he's got a little pecker on the end of his beak and he begins to peck and peck and that's how you come out by speaking the word do you see how it works well if you've got ears to hear then you will receive the word and it begins to produce something down on the inside of you and then your arm to begin to speak you can speak it and you can say i'm coming out i'm coming out i believe i believe the word i believe i believe his promises and you're coming out you see that's how you come out from the world that's how you come up through the promises that's how you come up through the capstone that's how you're going to take a body change by speaking what you have heard you've heard it and now you can speak it listen don't don't you ever let somebody say that you don't have a right to speak the word don't you ever let somebody say you don't have a right to be the voice of god in this age you the bride is the voice because she's heard the word and she can speak it you've heard it and now you've got a right to speak it you can say it because you know it because it's been revealed to you because you've heard it from the prophet you come out just the same way that little eagle chick comes out by his mouth by your mouth by speaking it well i might be the only one excited here tonight but that's all right brother brown said we just accept the word upon the basis god said so and sets a stream between you and god every channel comes open between you and god then he said and there is only one way provided by god for anything he said if people would just don't try to inject their own ideas but just take it the way god said it believing it see it it seems to be so hard for man just to get out of his own ideas just he's got to have something to do into it himself he's always gone up if you'd excuse the expression he's always gummed up god's way for him by his and by injecting his own way into it by jetting his own way well i got to see a pillar of fire i got to feel something i got to do this i got to come this way or that way or whatever any other way but by god's revealed word god's provided way is through his word his word that he's given to you if you believe it and accept it he said have they ever do you think they could find a better way for a chicken to be born than to peck its way out of the shell i just wonder if you could find any better way no sir he was born with a little pip on the end of his little bill and every time his little head knocks back and forth amen amen amen his head nodding back and forth amen i believe the word he scratches that shell until he scratches himself out yes sir you will never find a better way because that is god's provided way now here's the frustrating thing about this for ministers is the chickens got to pick his own way out i would love to be able to peg people out i would love to be able to just lay my hands on somebody and just give them the holy ghost like that but you got to pick your own way out you've got to pick your own way out and see if you're sitting here listening to me this this afternoon and you're saying i i don't believe anything that he's saying i don't believe that's right or arguing with it within yourself there's no way for you to pick your way out you've got to pick your way out it's like the saying goes that you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink you can lead him over there and say there's some water if you'll drink it your thirst will be quenched and you can tell you can tell a congregation full of people if you'll just accept god's word and believe it then you can have eternal life but they've got to pick their own way out you've got to pick your own way out of the shell he said poor little chicken you know i'm going to get a better way for you i'm just going to crack the shell and pick you out it would kill him that's right he would die he wouldn't live he's got to do that in order to build his strength enough to receive the air and things when he comes out he's provided with a tool he has got that little pip you've seen it little birds and chickens and as he nods his little head i believe him he scratches that egg back and forth until he peeps his way out if you'll take that as an example or in a way of making a point that's god that's god's way for christians to be born now walk up to the altar and give a man your right hand and put your name on the book but get down there and peep and cry and beg and plead and till god gives you strength then you come forth out of the shell of the world if somebody pastor just cracks the shell and takes you out say oh well that's all right we'll take you in anyhow you're dead that's all there is to it you got to like the bible says work your way work out your salvation with fear and trembling you've got to get down there and find out whether it's true or not you got to get down there and get serious with god and realize that there's something lacking in your life and and pray and see god and read your bible and all those things that are encompassed in pipping your way out of that shell i'm trying to find a stopping place now and this is hard this is hard to find a stopping place y'all y'all bear with me just a little bit longer are we doing okay i know there's some sleepy eyes in here but there's some that are not sleepy so some maybe are are getting something listen right here in the middle of this sermon brother brown's talking about the greatest battle ever fought and he begins he switches over to talk about ministering spirits why does he do that he begins to read in hebrews chapter one but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make down enemies that footstall thy footstool are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation and he begins to talk about the preaching of the gospel why did he do that right in the middle of this sermon well he's talking about how you got to pick your way out of the shell you gotta you you've got to believe the word that you're fighting a battle in your mind and right there in the middle he starts talking about preachers it's because preachers give you something to fight with that's why you come to churches because what you need to fight with what you need to overcome the devil is is the word of god now now wake up on me just for a little bit if you've got to pip your way out by speaking and agreeing with the word you've got to have the word and the minister there is not the minister is not there to hurt you like so many people think the minister's going to tell me that i'm wrong what greater blessing could there be than for a minister to tell you you're going about it the wrong way try this do this instead instead of doing like you've been doing and just beating your head against the wall try try getting into the bible try listening to the message on the way to work in school and in your car try getting along with god and meditating on the word and agreeing with it and not beating your head against the wall but agreeing with it it's the word that you're after a word birth the minister the ministering spirit is there to minister and now where this sermon in this sermon there's two spirits right so there's false ministers and there's true ministers and you've got to be able to tell the difference and the way that you tell the difference now maybe just in a baby form in a baby form the way that you tell the difference is a false minister will try to add something heaps something on your head that you got to do or take away a blessing from the bride of christ or you can't be the voice of god in this state or you can't have those bl the the the miracles and signs and wonders and those things those are from another day that he god is not hebrews 13 8 he's not the same yesterday today and forever he works different in this day than he did back then and it becomes somebody robbing you of a blessing well i don't know if you can get your healing now because healing was for another day and they're robbing you of a blessing or somebody heaps something on your head well you got to go through all these motions and get emotional and stuff somebody's adding to you see if you add something or take something away you're taking you're just messing the whole plan up if you add or take away there'll be curses added or taken for curses added to you or your name will be taken out of the book of life because you're just messing up the whole plan of god that's why ministering is such a treacherous thing it's got to be brought in just a perfect way so that people can be born again by the word and brother adam said how do we know they are how do we know that they are ministering spirits the bible says that the word of the lord came to the prophets is that right these angels minister his word through his spirit minister the word through the holy spirit and the spirit and the word came to the prophets and the prophets had the word of god so you know that it's true because they're preaching to you the word of god and they're not taking away nothing from you and they're not adding anything to it they're just preaching a blessing to you they're preaching to you that you can still get the holy ghost how to get the statue of perfect man that these virtues are required that there's a capstone that you can grow into that brother brown didn't just preach to show you another way a better way to get the baptism in the holy ghost but he preached to get us out of here to take a body change and that is preaching the true gospel i believe but somebody that will take any of those things away from you and detract from you it becomes a twist of the truth and it will lead you off into a valley a gutter or a ditch how can the blind lead the blind if you can't see where you're going but if you can see where you're going you can lead other people to the right path and that's why he begins to talk about ephesians chapter four i love ephesians chapter 4 why did he give some apostles prophets and evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints so that you would know that there's a statue of a perfect man that you're growing into so that you would know that there's a head that you're growing into into christ so that you would grow from a little babe that's tossed around and doesn't know which way he's going into the full stature of a perfect man that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of man and cunning craftiness whereby they lay it lie and wait to deceive that's why god sent a fivefold ministry so that you would not be deceived that's why there's such a thing as ministering spirits so that you will not be deceived and so that you could pick your way out of the shell so that you could be born out of this world into the promises of god into a higher reach anything to keep you in the egg is a lie from the devil anything to keep you trapped and stuck and thinking well i'm all right i must be all right i think i'm all right because i was so and so said that and so might be your grandma for years ago or your daddy or a false minister some little lie that was twisted to make you think you're all right but god sent a ministering spirit into the church to tell you the truth so that you would be born right so that you would know whether you're right or wrong that's why that i think one of the greatest things that god could give to the church is the gospel preached through men that's also why i believe that you if coming out of your shell by speaking the word is how to get out of that shell then the greatest form of worship would be the preaching of the gospel because the preaching of the gospel is the spoken word preached to free people from that shell oh my see what his tactic what he's trying to do i'm skimming through some of these quotes and then brother let me let me let me i'm close on this brother branham he ends with this dream that he has talking about the boatman and how he's going to store up food and he says in the dream i was just ordering all kinds of cabbages and turnips and radishes and things pile them in there like that and then i woke up why in the dream was he storing up cabbages because there's a shell for us to get out of and the way to get out of that shell the musicians can go ahead and come on the way to get out of that shell is by the word and that is what he was storing up he laid up he stored up for us not not just a better way to be born again but he stored up for us the fulfillment of the scriptures malachi 4 5-6 and luke 17 30 and revelation 10 7 and all those things to turn his heart to give us the word to turn our hearts back to the original faith to the original faith of the pentecostal fathers to give us an understanding to break out of the shell to break out of the shell not just to the word but to the world but to break out of this shell of our of our mortal carnal body that we're in because when you receive the seven seal mysteries when you eat that kind of a food it's going to give you power to break out of the bonds of this flesh into it it's going to change your body you believe that tonight let's just stand and worship the lord yes sir i believe the word is actually claiming you as you hear it the word is staking claim on your life right as you feast on it [Music] it'll make you a new creature in christ jesus it will open up your eyes so that you can see right it'll open up your ears so that you can hear right it'll cause your mouth to be able to speak right and cause your feet to walk right it'll put your hands to a different kind of work the word of god received and a pure and a contri heart will change you it will change your aren't you glad for that kind of change the kind of a word that can change us from what we used to be [Applause] my hands used to do things of the world my feet used to do things of the world but now i've been changed is that your testimony that you've been changed from that old creature that old man is dead and now you're alive in christ [Music] now if that's not your testimony this afternoon i wonder if it's maybe time to break out of that shield i wonder if maybe it's time to get desperate with god to come to the knowledge that you're not where you ought to be if you're not where you ought to be god has given us the antidote he's given us he's equipped us in this hour with what we need there's really been a change jesus oh is to the people of jesus and i pray god as you'll move upon this situation lord like you did upon the waters lord when you spoke the world into existence the lord god calls that little seed to spring forth the life of god granted i pray lord jesus move upon this situation as our sister has been burdened with lord god and we believe it lord god and we're coming joining our faith together lord jesus believing that you'll come up on the scene and move as our sister has asked for a little god we believe it lord jesus let it come to pass amen believe it [Music] sister [Music] amen and it's all because of calvary you know there's many things that jesus spoke about the bride that would not be true if it wasn't for calvary and for that shed blood but because of that california we have access to all that shed blood we have access to all the promises the redemptive blessing thank god for calvary let's sing another one just worship the [Music] lord you know what brings the spirit as a heart receptive to his word let's worship now and be receptive i believe he's here tonight this afternoon you think if you're if the veil of your eyes was lifted and you can look into that other room and see the angels walking down the pews see jesus here right here now moving among us just worship him now amen you love the lord this afternoon thank god for his grace to us to give us such a word anything else before you let's just go to the lord in prayer and be dismissed we thank you lord jesus for your grace to us lord i pray that something will say lord that will help encourage and strengthen lord your people to know how to do and and how to receive your blessings lord jesus we pray god that you'll go with them as they go their separate ways to their homes and just be with them in the coming week lord god and strengthen your people we pray thank you god for your word that you've given to us for your spirit here this evening lord thank you lord god for all your many blessings bless your people now we pray in your name amen you're dismissed spirit holy spirit you
