[0:03] this beautiful Easter Moon
[0:09] guess where we're going to be reading
[0:10] from
[0:15] we're almost done
[0:26] I don't know
[0:35] this is for
[0:38] 17.
[0:40] and this is starting the lineage of King
[0:45] so what I wanted to do as we go through
[0:47] the lineage obtain
[0:48] just to look at what the names of all of
[0:52] his uh descendants mean
[0:55] because the names and the people of the
[0:57] people in the Old Testament have I mean
[1:06] the people in Old Desmond gave their
[1:08] children names that meant something
[1:10] about who they were and what happened
[1:13] when they were born and um
[1:16] so in the verses before we saw how Cain
[1:19] left the presence of the Lord
[1:22] and he went out and became a Wanderer
[1:24] and that's how it is when we leave the
[1:26] president anyone that leaves the
[1:27] presence of the Lord they don't know
[1:28] where they're going don't know where
[1:29] they came from
[1:31] um I remember looking at his school we
[1:33] looked at this painting that a famous
[1:35] painter made that it was talking about
[1:37] where who are we where did we come from
[1:40] and
[1:41] they just don't know where what's going
[1:45] on
[1:46] so let's as we go down through the list
[1:49] let's take a look at each of the
[1:51] meanings of the names let's start at
[1:53] verse 17 and Cain knew his wife and she
[1:55] can see
[1:57] and bear Enoch
[1:59] and he built the city and call the name
[2:01] of the city after the name of his son
[2:03] Enoch
[2:04] so
[2:06] he dedicated the city to Enoch and
[2:09] that's what Enoch means and you know
[2:11] there's an Enoch but the seventh from
[2:13] Adam was evening and there's also this
[2:15] is a different name we're talking about
[2:17] just to be clear
[2:19] this can be a little bit confusing so
[2:22] Enoch means dedicated or initiated
[2:26] I skipped somebody let's go back to King
[2:28] what's cane mean Kane means position or
[2:31] required because you've said I've gotten
[2:33] a man from the Lord she she thought that
[2:36] she had acquired a man from the Lord but
[2:38] we know that nobody can be born unless
[2:40] the God allows it so in that sense he
[2:43] was from the Lord
[2:44] um but he wasn't the promise seed that
[2:47] she was looking for
[2:51] and unto Enoch was born Iraq and Iran to
[2:55] get
[2:57] Methuselah and methusel to get my neck
[3:01] so Euro means
[3:03] Fugitive
[3:06] because they have delanians have become
[3:08] a fugitive from all over but all means
[3:12] Smitten by God or destroyed of God
[3:17] methusiomes
[3:19] I am a mortal where is God
[3:23] I am Immortal Immortal a Immortal I am a
[3:28] mortal
[3:30] and to find the meaning that I compared
[3:33] Strong's Concordance and um
[3:36] this website I found that takes the
[3:38] Hebrew roots and looks at what the
[3:41] Hebrew parts of the word you know like
[3:43] El means god and breaks it down and um
[3:47] you know Strong's Concordia says that my
[3:50] enthuselah for example means who is of
[3:52] God but if you break down a different
[3:53] Hebrew Parts it becomes I am a moral
[3:56] where is God
[3:58] and limit
[4:00] now we talked briefly about him earlier
[4:03] that Lemay was a he's a classic example
[4:07] of the Rebel who's lean from God and he
[4:10] became a murderer he took um Vengeance
[4:13] into his own hands and said well Cain is
[4:15] going to be of any Sevenfold without
[4:17] being said anytime soon
[4:19] and um so he he murdered someone that
[4:21] will read a little bit further along
[4:23] with
[4:24] um
[4:25] treated it did something evil to lame he
[4:28] took Venus against him so lamech is a
[4:31] rebel
[4:32] he's the first one in the Bible we're a
[4:34] quarter to
[4:35] um
[4:38] take more than one wife
[4:40] uh first this was a second murderer I
[4:43] mean he had a spirit of this I'm going
[4:46] to do whatever I want
[4:48] to lamech means for lowering for
[4:51] humiliation
[4:54] and the strongest concorda says that
[4:56] means shade
[5:00] so he took two wives let's read verse
[5:03] 19.
[5:06] now lamech took unto him two wives the
[5:08] name of the one was Ada in the name of
[5:11] the other Zillow
[5:12] I couldn't find one of those two names
[5:14] mean
[5:16] I ate a bear jobel now these are the
[5:20] three sons that kind of rhyme job
[5:22] and they all really mean the same thing
[5:25] they mean stream because from these
[5:28] three came streams of civilization that
[5:30] civil that in in what they represent you
[5:34] can see how uh man is getting away from
[5:37] God by building cities
[5:40] um
[5:41] let's take a closer look verse 20 into
[5:44] Ada Bell job he was the father of such
[5:47] as dwell intense and of such as half
[5:49] cattle
[5:51] so this can be a little confusing
[5:53] because you think okay well the
[5:54] Israelites well intense too what's so
[5:56] bad about that well it's think of it as
[5:59] a double is the the beginning of
[6:02] artificial shelter and livelihood
[6:04] building great cities building
[6:07] um
[6:08] but
[6:09] creating comfort for ourselves
[6:12] that allows us to get away from God you
[6:15] know we could recover should allow us to
[6:18] um
[6:19] to sit in the private comfort of our
[6:21] home and and listen to God's word and
[6:23] read our Bible but oftentimes it gets us
[6:26] further away from God you know we have a
[6:28] television set up in a house where I
[6:30] mean not me but in people your
[6:33] television can get you away from God and
[6:35] put something in front of you that
[6:38] it takes you further away from God so
[6:41] that's what job will represents a stream
[6:42] the beginning he says either the father
[6:45] of such as dwelling tennis and have
[6:46] cattle the beginning of artificial
[6:48] shelter and livelihood
[6:50] and let's see
[6:52] and his brother's name was Jubal
[6:55] he was the father of all such as Handel
[6:58] the heart
[6:59] in Oregon
[7:01] and that doesn't seem so bad at first
[7:03] glance because David played the harp and
[7:05] he brought the spirit when you know to
[7:07] go around talked about how that a
[7:10] menstrual brings the spirit of the Lord
[7:13] but this was really the beginning of
[7:18] musicals and artistic expression
[7:21] and um so I have some folks to read
[7:24] about that in a little bit about music
[7:27] but music
[7:28] can take you further away from God also
[7:32] and um and then of Zilla
[7:34] tubal was born
[7:36] an instructor of every artificial in
[7:38] brass and iron
[7:40] and two will represents the economy
[7:43] and interaction
[7:45] worldwide industry and manipulation of
[7:48] metals now this is interesting because
[7:51] if you remember your history in school
[7:53] the ironies began in 1200 BC
[7:57] this is what three thousand years before
[8:00] the Iron Iron Age was ever supposed to
[8:02] begin
[8:03] so this is this is an example of how we
[8:06] know the Bible is true you know people
[8:09] in school talk about how the early
[8:12] settlers didn't understand that the
[8:14] world was round the Bible talks about
[8:16] how the sphere of the Earth
[8:19] years before
[8:21] um
[8:21] we history says that we understood that
[8:24] the Earth was round
[8:26] um so tubal was already working an iron
[8:29] thousands of years before
[8:32] if you want to do any research on your
[8:34] own on Iron Age for uh history said it
[8:37] says that that should have happened
[8:43] solemax
[8:45] and his descendants represent Rebellion
[8:47] against God's word and decided he was
[8:50] just going to do whatever he wanted to
[8:51] do
[8:54] see what brother Randall says about
[8:55] civilization God's power to transform in
[8:58] 1965 he said civilization started Dr
[9:01] Scofield here in my Scofield bible it
[9:03] says the first civilization notice then
[9:05] he begot sons and they may orbit the
[9:06] music the next one we got son that he
[9:09] began to do other things the Wonder
[9:11] build cities and make instruments of
[9:14] brass and all kinds of things
[9:16] see that's what he did become the first
[9:18] civilization which was canine he's done
[9:21] the same thing down through the Yankees
[9:23] and uh the Raptors that we find out that
[9:26] in Genesis 4 the Cain's people started
[9:28] civilizations
[9:29] building towns and cities and so forth
[9:31] and instruments of music and becoming
[9:33] science
[9:34] and the people got further away from God
[9:36] yet religious
[9:38] but would assess people come on they
[9:40] begin to come on call on the name of the
[9:42] Lord
[9:45] Empower transformation he said
[9:48] now notice as soon as they went out from
[9:50] the presence of the Lord they started
[9:51] building cities they started making
[9:53] instruments they started in science to
[9:55] making grass and iron and playing music
[9:57] and so forth see now where did it come
[10:00] from juvenile came the circuit you
[10:02] understand it pain went out and noticed
[10:04] he went out from the presence of the
[10:05] Lord and started working in science
[10:07] now look where he is still working see
[10:09] science education cities culture it's of
[10:12] the devil who started it the devil who
[10:14] is it today the devil atomic bombs and
[10:17] things to destroy us we're reliving it
[10:19] we have to live here we ought to be and
[10:22] we have to stay here but God's Great
[10:24] civilization won't have any of that in
[10:26] it
[10:27] the science is taking the natural things
[10:30] and perverting it to do things that
[10:31] wasn't intended to do
[10:34] science is I was reading some things
[10:37] that different scientists have to say
[10:39] about science versus God and what
[10:41] scientist said that uh if you did away
[10:43] with all the religions in the world and
[10:45] did away with all the knowledge you'd
[10:47] still be able to prove
[10:49] science they take science and turn it
[10:52] into their God
[10:54] it's exactly the opposite of how we
[10:56] believe that if you took away everything
[10:59] if you blew up the world we still have
[11:02] the word to stand on
[11:05] because heaven and earth will pass away
[11:07] from our Lord will never pass away
[11:15] let's see
[11:24] Genesis chapter verse 23 24 and lament
[11:29] said unto his wives
[11:31] hear my voice you wise of the neck
[11:34] hearken unto my speech for I have slain
[11:36] a man to my willingness and a young man
[11:39] to my heart and we talked about that
[11:40] early with vengeance where we compare
[11:42] the container's prayer in psalm 79.
[11:46] where David was seeking the Lord to take
[11:49] ninjas instead of for himself and uh and
[11:53] you know misunderstood the Sevenfold
[11:55] protection of God is a right for him to
[11:57] just take matters in his own hands and
[11:59] kill whoever he thought did him wrong
[12:02] um and so let's talk about this for a
[12:05] second howl a Mac took two wives
[12:07] and just reviewed polygamy now I think I
[12:10] believe we all understand that pleasing
[12:11] is wrong
[12:12] let's take a look at the scripture
[12:17] um
[12:21] about what a lot of people do is um
[12:23] if you if you look at how people
[12:27] defend their faith if you look at the
[12:30] Catholics how they defend their faith
[12:31] they'll look at the writings of eusebius
[12:33] and um the uh origin or whatnot and
[12:37] they'll use that as an example of what
[12:39] they believe they'll use those writings
[12:42] and the same thing with the Jehovah's
[12:43] Witnesses or any any faith a lot of
[12:46] times message Believers will tend to
[12:48] instead of taking it back to the Bible
[12:49] you got to line up the message because
[12:52] the message was sent to shine a light on
[12:54] the scripture to open it up so we could
[12:57] understand scripture if you can't go
[12:59] back to the word and approve your your
[13:02] Doctrine or your belief by the word
[13:04] you might not have any you might be
[13:07] staring on sinking Sands
[13:10] so to find out where the polygamy is
[13:12] right we'll go back to the example that
[13:14] Paul said for us and Paul is such a
[13:17] great teacher he was taught by gamalia
[13:19] and he knew the word back and forth and
[13:21] uh
[13:22] so he understood scripture and if we you
[13:25] know when brother Reina went beyond the
[13:26] curtain of time they said we're resting
[13:28] on the fact that your message is built
[13:31] on Paul's message we're resting on that
[13:34] and so that's what we're we have great
[13:37] faith if we can say the same thing that
[13:39] Paul did
[13:40] in First Corinthians set of two
[13:43] he said nevertheless I'll just read you
[13:46] don't have to turn there nevertheless to
[13:47] avoid fornication let every man
[13:50] have his own life
[13:52] and let every woman have her own husband
[13:54] not wives or husbands but wife and
[13:58] husband and woman
[14:00] that's the yeah
[14:03] in first Timothy 3 1-2 talking about
[14:06] Bishops so Bishop then must be blameless
[14:09] the husband of one wife Vigilant sober
[14:12] of good behavior given to hospitality
[14:14] aptit teach and verse 12 let the deacons
[14:17] be the husbands of one wife ruling their
[14:19] children in their own house as well and
[14:21] I was reading what a uh a Mormon had to
[14:24] say about this and that Mormons to
[14:27] defend their faith they'll uh instead of
[14:31] what this should be is as a deacon or
[14:33] official is an example of how everyone
[14:35] should live their life the Deacon has
[14:38] married to one wife because if you're
[14:39] married at all you should have one wife
[14:41] not more than one wife the Mormons say
[14:43] that the Deacon has a special case that
[14:46] is outside of the normal operation of
[14:49] most people that um or this particular
[14:52] moment it might I guess you could say
[14:54] not every moment maybe but this
[14:56] particular moment that I was reading
[14:57] what he said
[14:58] said that uh
[15:01] a deacon or a bishop that Paul's
[15:04] speaking of is not an example for how
[15:06] able Believers live but that's not true
[15:10] that Titus 1-6 and Elder must be
[15:13] blameless
[15:14] faithful to his wife
[15:17] a man whose children believe and are not
[15:19] open to the charge of being Wild
[15:22] and this would be it
[15:25] and I was reading this morning about uh
[15:28] Martin Luther
[15:30] I guess one of the one thing that they
[15:33] always
[15:34] Roman Catholics and whatnot try always
[15:36] bring against Martin Luther is this
[15:39] story of Philip there was a man named
[15:40] Phillip who
[15:44] tell you the story he got married to a
[15:47] woman that he found unattractive after
[15:50] he got married somehow I I don't really
[15:53] understand how how he ended up married
[15:56] to or whatnot but after he married her
[15:59] he uh decided he didn't like her too
[16:01] much so like a year after he got married
[16:04] he he went into adultery and that kind
[16:07] of thing and started to uh he started
[16:09] reading the writings of the Wittenberg
[16:12] Martin Luther and and his friend Milan
[16:15] who um
[16:17] at the time he was helping Martin Luther
[16:19] there at Wittenberg and they both had
[16:21] written some things to kind of seem like
[16:24] it might be okay in certain
[16:26] circumstances to marry another wife for
[16:29] example Martin Luther said he felt like
[16:31] that um remember Martin Luther was a
[16:33] reformer not a prophet and he said that
[16:36] he felt like um if your wife was left
[16:38] for us or severely infirmed that it
[16:41] might be in certain circumstances okay
[16:43] to take a why but he advised Philip
[16:46] that you can't just look at the
[16:48] Patriarchs and say well because David
[16:51] had more than one wife I'm going to take
[16:52] a wife you have to you have to uh
[16:55] you have you will need a Divine uh call
[16:59] in your life from God and that's what
[17:01] Martin Luther told me
[17:03] um
[17:04] but what the root of the thing was that
[17:07] Philip had gone into adultery and he was
[17:09] looking at for an excuse
[17:11] to
[17:13] um an excuse for his lascivious behavior
[17:15] that was what was the root of the
[17:17] problem
[17:18] and um
[17:20] so the long story short he uh
[17:25] he ended up getting looser to and
[17:28] melanchon to to kind of uh in a private
[17:31] confessional a private situation say in
[17:34] certain circumstances it would I I
[17:36] believe it would be okay for you to get
[17:38] a little while this occurred after
[17:41] Philip had already arranged to marry
[17:45] someone else he already had it in mind
[17:47] he already had it all planned out and
[17:49] this was a it ended up being a big Mark
[17:51] against Martin Luther it turned into a
[17:53] huge thing throughout Germany all of the
[17:56] people in Germany were just outraged
[17:58] that Philip um ended up marrying a
[18:00] second wife ended up being a huge thing
[18:02] but you can see the root of polygamy as
[18:08] is uh to cover up licentious desires
[18:15] and the reason we don't do polygamy
[18:17] today is because of the New Covenant
[18:20] let me just read a few quotes
[18:22] that brother Brandon said now because
[18:24] you know Martin Luther was a reformer
[18:26] and he couldn't bring it out
[18:28] and mayor's in divorce
[18:30] I'm going to start with this one
[18:33] 1965 for the random takes it all the way
[18:35] back to the beginning where there was
[18:37] this man and a woman in the very
[18:39] beginning why how uh what happened he
[18:44] said now the world is to be repopulated
[18:47] after the fall not by the original
[18:49] creation of God like in the beginning
[18:50] not by the original creation but by sex
[18:53] desire now that takes the care of the
[18:55] beginning doesn't it so in the beginning
[18:57] there was going to be reproduction by
[18:59] spiritual reproduction just like now the
[19:02] New Covenant is reproduction by Spoken
[19:04] Word reproducing himself the bride is
[19:07] born by the word now that takes care of
[19:09] the beginning doesn't it in the
[19:10] beginning there was only one man and one
[19:12] woman one male and one female and when
[19:15] she crossed that line and brought us in
[19:16] our world is to be repopulated again by
[19:19] sex not by creation by sex
[19:21] see where the woman is at now
[19:25] but that's the way the world is
[19:26] populated today through women
[19:28] now remember Lemay he uh none of none of
[19:32] the children have said ever began to
[19:35] take more than one wife until after
[19:37] Genesis 9 when God came down and said um
[19:42] told Noah multiply and replace the Earth
[19:45] that was the second time he said
[19:46] multiply me please third first time was
[19:48] Genesis 1 26 27. in Genesis 9 he said
[19:51] multiplying replenish the Earth and he
[19:53] set up a new covenant word now and
[19:55] instead of in the in the evening they
[19:57] only ate vegetables now they can eat
[19:59] meat as long as they don't take it and
[20:02] we kind of discussed that last time now
[20:04] he and Genesis 9 he set up a new couple
[20:06] now by uh
[20:09] to multiply and replace the Earth with
[20:11] me that promise was over
[20:16] in 1965 marriage and divorce she said
[20:18] but when he was born into the creation
[20:20] of God who cannot die from that other
[20:22] tree that was in the Garden of Eden
[20:23] Christ eternal life to come by that tree
[20:25] price is true enough to put
[20:27] multiplication of Adam and Eve was
[20:28] through sex replace the Earth but it
[20:31] wasn't so at the beginning God just made
[20:33] a male and a female like he did as other
[20:35] creatures she legal just like the church
[20:39] and Hebrews chapter 7 1957 he said if I
[20:44] said tomorrow about my wife or well I'd
[20:46] like to have two wives I like to run
[20:48] around with this one do this one there
[20:50] but if I do my wife will divorce me and
[20:53] my kids will be in my ministry will be
[20:55] lost
[20:56] you dirty rotten hypocrite that's right
[20:58] you don't love her right in the first
[21:00] place
[21:03] it ain't right to take another wife even
[21:05] if like Martin Luther said even if she's
[21:08] uh he he thought it would be okay if she
[21:10] was lepers and whatnot but that's not
[21:13] right that's not true love until death
[21:16] do you part
[21:17] Jehovah Jireh 1955 he said look at the
[21:21] papers and things how they're packing
[21:24] how perversion people is on the move
[21:25] because men can't be satisfied with one
[21:27] life with one wife and he's looking he's
[21:31] living with everything every woman that
[21:33] he can run around with and women the
[21:35] same way and it's become just like the
[21:37] scene of Saul
[21:39] this is exactly what Phillips problem
[21:41] was he was uh
[21:47] problem was he's trying to find an
[21:50] excuse for his perversion marriage in
[21:53] divorce 1965 then when the double
[21:55] Covenant was made by a man a woman
[21:57] through sex and the other Covenant all
[21:58] together not the original coming up but
[22:00] another Covenant now I was introduced
[22:02] polygamy and all that after the
[22:05] beginning believe me was there he was
[22:06] both in man beasts after the beginning
[22:08] of fall God now secondarily sets a new
[22:11] nature Again by Sex God created the
[22:12] first of all six now this is kind of
[22:15] theologically this is diff this is how
[22:19] um we are different from almost every
[22:21] other denomination so if you look at
[22:23] what except for the Mormons most almost
[22:26] everyone else teaches that even in the
[22:28] Old Testament that David and Solomon and
[22:30] them were in sin when they took more
[22:32] than one wife but brother random teaches
[22:34] that that was that was perfectly the
[22:36] will of God
[22:37] to um as a type a natural type of a
[22:41] spiritual
[22:42] one uh
[22:43] you know God has many member bribe
[22:53] and marriage and divorce 1965 he said um
[22:58] how today the spiritual multiplication
[23:01] when we're back there shows then that
[23:03] the bride has got to come from the word
[23:05] by spiritual multiplication
[23:08] multiplication C replenishing the Earth
[23:12] just like it was back then
[23:14] Injustice 126-27 and so it is is it
[23:18] where the church that refuses to become
[23:20] pregnant in the age that we now live in
[23:22] to bring forth children of this age we
[23:25] are not Lutheran we're not with these
[23:27] neither are we Pentecostals we've got to
[23:29] be children of this age through the
[23:31] pregnancy of the word of God to bring
[23:32] forth a child of this age to see child
[23:36] children begin to kind of look more like
[23:39] him because it's full and mature or it
[23:41] becomes Children of the word not
[23:42] children of the church Children of the
[23:44] word and the bride will be a lovely
[23:46] little lady of the word unadulterated
[23:48] not touched by any man's organization
[23:50] any man-made Theory should be purely
[23:52] unadulitated for all worth
[23:55] I hope you get that out on the air she
[23:57] will be a cremated daughter of God
[24:01] that's how the bride is reproduced today
[24:04] by spiritual multiplication
[24:07] now
[24:09] I just want to talk briefly about
[24:11] completely
[24:13] and then jump back to in the last five
[24:17] minutes
[24:18] talk a little bit more about music
[24:22] because that was one of the three
[24:24] components of civilization artificial
[24:27] shelter and Lively hooded music
[24:29] Worldwide industry and manipulation of
[24:31] metals economy
[24:39] in 1965 the God of this evil age broke
[24:42] around and said watch the seed of God
[24:44] coming down through every age and watch
[24:46] where it's heading up today Christians
[24:48] genuine Christians are not all about
[24:50] scientific research and stuff you know
[24:52] just a minute we'll get into that but
[24:54] Kings did after the nature of their
[24:55] father the devil full of worldly
[24:57] knowledge of beauty and science
[24:58] therefore Haynes children with
[25:01] scientific they were educated there was
[25:02] a player to music music instruments a
[25:05] modern Elvis Presley some of this stuff
[25:07] like that the school board let's happen
[25:09] up here in the lane every Saturday night
[25:11] Builders of City beautifying women with
[25:14] personal lust of the devil giving women
[25:16] paint and bobbing their hair
[25:18] put them in the shorts and things like
[25:20] that it's for his own dirty lust that's
[25:23] pretty flat but I don't know any other
[25:25] way to say it
[25:27] the return in Jubilee 1962 you said
[25:30] start a Revival again Lord bring the
[25:33] people out of these
[25:34] full of things that they do play a
[25:36] little music and dance they call in the
[25:38] spirit
[25:39] by the rhythm of the music oh God I've
[25:42] seen them God Can Dance up and down the
[25:43] streets or in a bar room or anywhere
[25:45] else under the power of God when he's
[25:46] dancing with his spirit and shouting
[25:48] praise God
[25:49] they may seem a little different on the
[25:51] outside or and your church is expressing
[25:53] what's on the other side of it
[25:57] so um
[26:00] I've got a few quotes here about you
[26:02] know some people have different ideas
[26:05] about whether it's okay to have
[26:08] music in the church I think it's the
[26:10] Church of God that doesn't um Church of
[26:13] Christ that does it
[26:15] um
[26:16] and uh we'll have to answer myself what
[26:19] not in Matthew 26 30
[26:23] I'll just uh kind of talk about it they
[26:26] this is where they uh
[26:28] we're having the Last Supper
[26:31] I'm just going to run through a history
[26:33] of Music in the church real quick
[26:35] they uh they had the last supper and
[26:37] then they sang a ham after they were
[26:39] finished
[26:40] and uh
[26:42] the the Jews today it's been a tradition
[26:46] since I guess the time of Jesus to to
[26:49] sing after the Last Supper The Great
[26:52] hollyoak which is song 136. so they
[26:55] think that's probably the song that they
[26:57] sang
[26:58] after uh
[27:01] you don't want to just turn there real
[27:02] quick just as an exercise to see more
[27:04] psalm 136.
[27:27] well you can see how um
[27:29] just the way this is written would
[27:31] probably fit really good into Chicago
[27:36] the music of the of the way the Jews do
[27:40] it I'll give thanks and I'm not gonna
[27:42] read I'll just read a little bit because
[27:43] it's a little long I'll give thanks unto
[27:45] the Lord for he is good for his mercy
[27:47] endureth forever I'll give thanks unto
[27:50] the god of God for his Mercy endures
[27:52] forever I'll give thanks to the Lord of
[27:54] the Lord for his Mercy in your prayer to
[27:57] him who alone doeth great wonders for
[27:59] his Mercy endured forever so is that
[28:02] that's an example of the song that the
[28:03] early Believers with a song after after
[28:06] they took communion
[28:08] and do you still sing that today after
[28:10] uh the Passover
[28:14] so uh according to Historia the early
[28:17] church didn't use any instruments
[28:20] because they were afraid that it would
[28:21] it would associate too closely with Rome
[28:24] the Roman debauchery and how that they
[28:26] uh
[28:28] you know they played their role in
[28:30] Boogie Woogie music and the early
[28:32] Christians didn't want to have anything
[28:33] to do with that
[28:35] so uh they just they would sing you know
[28:37] uh either the song leader would sing a
[28:40] verse and then they would repeat after
[28:41] it or they were to buy the congregation
[28:43] and the different singing groups and one
[28:44] was saying the first person the next
[28:46] sing the next verse so that's how they
[28:48] did they did uh they just
[28:50] you know a lot of the early churches
[28:52] only had maybe 20 or 25 people in the
[28:54] church it's a real small group and they
[28:56] just sang without instruments because
[28:58] they wanted to avoid any appearance of
[28:59] evil like uh all also avoid the
[29:02] appearance of evil
[29:04] in the Middle Ages the church started uh
[29:08] they were very strict about even certain
[29:11] cores that were seemed unharmonious and
[29:14] blasphemous they didn't even want to
[29:16] have any kind of cores that sounded
[29:18] wrong everything had to be just right
[29:20] and so even through the Middle Ages they
[29:22] didn't the the church really didn't play
[29:24] instruments it was one until Martin
[29:26] Luther that congregational Center really
[29:29] became popular and Martin Luther
[29:31] actually said I don't even hear I don't
[29:33] care who preaches as long as I write the
[29:35] song
[29:38] uh so loser actually established
[29:40] congregational singing and uh
[29:43] but just here's what brother random said
[29:45] about
[29:50] he got a question that church orders are
[29:52] not a church order in 1963 just how many
[29:56] let's see instruments how many
[29:58] instruments are we to have in church
[29:59] inside the organic piano
[30:02] so I guess some people are concerned
[30:04] about little things like that like they
[30:06] were in the Middle Ages brother Brown it
[30:08] takes a profit to set a straight and tie
[30:10] in all the Loose Ends
[30:12] well it depends on if you have a String
[30:14] Band or whatever you had you see I don't
[30:15] know what you got what this means I
[30:17] don't understand it
[30:18] because the organ and the piano or
[30:20] property of the church
[30:23] and he goes on if they have are their
[30:25] own instruments wonderful if they don't
[30:27] have their own instruments and they're a
[30:28] member here of a band not just a person
[30:30] running through even plays once in a
[30:31] while it runs out like that it's got to
[30:33] be a band in the church because you got
[30:35] to be consecrated
[30:37] you got to be uh Sanctified to play not
[30:41] play in the church and then go out and
[30:43] play in some Honky Tonk or something
[30:44] that's I'm not reading from the quote
[30:46] that's me
[30:48] the church wouldn't buy a trumpet for a
[30:51] man that plays it here in tomorrow night
[30:52] somewhere else and somewhere else and
[30:55] drop in once in a while and play a
[30:56] little bit no sir it's got to be a band
[30:58] right here organized band with the
[31:00] leader and then the church talk to them
[31:02] about buying the instruments
[31:04] anything he said uh talking about how
[31:07] the spirit the Lord comes by this this
[31:11] presence of the Lord can be brought by a
[31:13] Minstrel
[31:15] you know someone this doesn't make the
[31:17] valley full of ditches in 1952 you know
[31:19] someone told me wrong not long ago said
[31:21] brother random music and the church is
[31:22] wrong
[31:23] I said it is I said do you think God
[31:25] changes in nature no I said then when
[31:29] the prophet got all skewed up and they
[31:30] said bring a menstrual when the
[31:32] menstrual began to play the hand of the
[31:34] Lord can perform the prophet and that
[31:36] music brought the power of God then it
[31:38] would bring the power of God now that's
[31:40] just exactly God still sing God and the
[31:43] prophet now you might not be the prophet
[31:45] that you can be the ministry you can be
[31:47] part of it anyhow to bring the power of
[31:48] God and that's really the role of the
[31:51] yes the musicians in the church was to
[31:53] bring the presence of the Lord before
[31:55] the ministry comes out and uh
[31:58] I'll finish it right quick if you ever
[32:01] have trouble getting into the spirit of
[32:03] prayer before you pray or anything or
[32:05] just uh sometimes it's hard to get
[32:07] let's get started praying I found it if
[32:09] you just put on some quiet music or
[32:11] start singing then it really does help
[32:14] bring the presence of the Lord
[32:16] but uh
[32:17] I think we just about finished
[32:31] yeah one
[32:34] um
[32:38] means pleasure and um
[32:42] scope Revival and Zillow means to hide
[32:46] pleasure and to hide yes thank you
[32:49] sister
[33:04] and then what I'm gonna do next is
[33:07] continue on with uh Genesis 5. we're
[33:10] going to look at a genealogy and then
[33:11] bounce all over to Matthew and Luke and
[33:13] compare the two genealogies there see
[33:16] what we can find her
[33:17] yeah a lot of times when you're driving
[33:19] around or doing something you're
[33:20] thinking and Devil's touching people in
[33:22] the bathtub
[33:24] and sing a song
