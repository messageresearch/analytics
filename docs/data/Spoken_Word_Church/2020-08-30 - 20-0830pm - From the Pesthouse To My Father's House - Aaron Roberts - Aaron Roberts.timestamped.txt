[22:24] thank the lord for all his blessings on

[22:28] and
[22:32] i want to say on
[22:35] behalf of our family we appreciate
[22:38] the church and
[22:40] and the prayers
[22:42] and the
[22:44] everything that was done on our behalf
[22:47] with the passing of dead
[22:50] and
[22:51] this is kind of
[22:53] y'all may think this is a little bit of
[22:54] a funeral service
[22:56] today but
[23:01] it may it may sound a little
[23:03] a little odd today but
[23:07] when a child of god
[23:09] goes home it's not a
[23:11] it's not a sad time
[23:13] it's sad for us
[23:16] but you know it's a celebration
[23:20] you know
[23:22] paul wrote to us in first thessalonians
[23:27] and he said i would not have you be
[23:28] ignorant brother
[23:31] that we should not be
[23:32] we should not sorrow
[23:35] we should sorrow not
[23:37] as those that have no hope
[23:40] you know he didn't say that you wouldn't
[23:41] have sorrow
[23:44] he said not to sorrow as those who have
[23:46] no hope
[23:48] for jesus christ we have hope
[23:52] we have an assurance in our
[23:54] in our day and
[23:57] god has a better place for us
[23:59] amen
[24:01] and
[24:05] uh
[24:07] like brother bob was talking about this
[24:08] morning
[24:10] starting to get leaky so
[24:12] we're gonna we're gonna do the best we
[24:13] can but
[24:15] uh
[24:16] you know it's it's a great time to
[24:17] realize that
[24:19] you know
[24:20] as
[24:20] the song
[24:22] uh
[24:23] we sing just a little while to labor
[24:26] just a little while to wait yeah
[24:29] you know
[24:29] you know we're just gonna be down here
[24:31] for a little while longer for us to
[24:33] struggle and walk in this path that's
[24:35] straight
[24:36] you know but you know soon that our
[24:38] troubles will be over
[24:41] you know we have that we have that
[24:42] promise
[24:45] and uh you know that's what i it's gonna
[24:47] it may sound a little simple today but
[24:49] you know what
[24:50] if it's real to you
[24:54] i tell you what it
[24:55] it means the world to me
[24:59] because we don't know how much longer
[25:00] we've got but i don't believe it'll be
[25:02] much longer but
[25:03] i'm looking forward to the
[25:05] the splendor of heaven
[25:07] and the glory that
[25:09] shall be revealed in us
[25:12] because there's going to be a
[25:15] you know we're looking for a
[25:16] resurrection
[25:18] but you know that's our that's our
[25:20] responsibility
[25:22] all the ones that run their race before
[25:24] us
[25:25] now it's our responsibility to run our
[25:28] race
[25:29] to finish the course to fight the good
[25:31] fight
[25:32] because without
[25:34] uh we cannot they cannot be made perfect
[25:37] it's all the body work
[25:39] and if they've done their part then it's
[25:40] our responsibility to do our part
[25:43] and that's what god's called us to do
[25:47] to be as as brother bob was talking
[25:49] about this morning it was
[25:52] it was
[25:55] very timely i thought
[25:57] yes
[25:58] because you know what it's time for us
[25:59] to check up on what where we're at
[26:02] are we walking where we need to be
[26:06] not just not just claiming to be a
[26:08] christian or not a message a believer
[26:10] but are you walking in the path that god
[26:12] has called you are you walking in the
[26:14] light that god has called you to are you
[26:16] walking in the fullness that god has for
[26:19] you
[26:20] amen
[26:22] we need to lay aside every weight and
[26:24] everything that
[26:25] so easily besets us
[26:27] and run this race as god has set before
[26:29] us
[26:32] i just appreciate this morning's word
[26:35] brother bob it was it was good
[26:39] but uh
[26:40] before we get into all
[26:41] in the scripture and everything and
[26:43] look at these things let's just all bow
[26:45] our heads and
[26:46] speak to the author

[30:14] and so that's where i got that from
[30:19] first corinthians 15 verse 39 says
[30:22] all flesh is not the same flesh but
[30:25] there is one kind of flesh of man
[30:27] another flesh of beast another fishes
[30:29] and another of birds and there are also
[30:31] celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial
[30:34] but the glory of the celestial is one
[30:36] and the glory of the terrestrial is
[30:37] another
[30:40] there is one glory of the sun and
[30:42] another glory of the moon and of the
[30:44] glory of the stars for one glory
[30:45] different
[30:46] from another star in glory
[30:49] so also is the resurrection of the dead
[30:51] it is sown in corruption it is raised in
[30:54] incorruption it is only dishonor is
[30:56] raised in glory it is sown in weakness
[30:59] it is raised in power it has sown a
[31:01] natural body it raises a spiritual body
[31:04] there is a natural body and there is a
[31:05] spiritual body
[31:07] so it is written the first man adam was
[31:10] made a living soul the last adam
[31:13] was made a quickening spirit
[31:15] how be it that was not first which is
[31:17] spiritual but that which is natural and
[31:20] afterwards that which is spiritual the
[31:22] first man is of the earth earthy and the
[31:24] second man is of the lord from heaven
[31:27] as is the earth these such are
[31:29] sorts are they also that are earthy and
[31:32] as is the heavenly such are they also
[31:35] that are heavenly and as we have borne
[31:37] the image of the earth thee we shall
[31:39] also bear the image of the heavenly now
[31:41] this i say brethren that flesh and blood
[31:43] cannot inherit the kingdom of god
[31:45] neither doth corruption inherit
[31:46] incorruption behold i show you a mystery
[31:49] we shall not all sleep but we shall be
[31:51] changed in a moment of twinkling i at
[31:53] the last trump
[31:55] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[31:56] shall be raised incorruptable
[31:59] and we shall be changed
[32:01] for this corruptable must
[32:06] that's powerful
[32:08] for this this corruptible must put on
[32:11] incorruption
[32:12] amen and this mortal must put on
[32:14] immortality
[32:16] so when this corruptible shall have put
[32:18] on him
[32:19] in
[32:20] in corruption and this mortal shall have
[32:22] put on immortality then shall be brought
[32:24] to pass the saying that is written death
[32:26] is swallowed up in victory oh death
[32:28] where is thy sting o grave where is thy
[32:30] victory the sting of death
[32:32] is sin and the strength of sin is the
[32:34] law but thanks be to god which giveth us
[32:36] the victory through our lord jesus
[32:38] christ therefore my beloved brethren be
[32:41] ye steadfast unmovable always abounding
[32:44] is that always abounding in the work of
[32:46] the lord
[32:49] what is the work of the lord that's what
[32:50] god's called you to do
[32:53] you know it's to be faithful and even in
[32:55] the small things whatever god's called
[32:57] you to do
[32:58] that's all he said always abounding
[33:01] in the work of the lord for as much as
[33:02] you know that your labor is not in vain
[33:05] in the lord
[33:07] and then we go to
[33:08] john chapter 14.
[33:12] very familiar
[33:13] he said let not your heart be troubled
[33:16] you believe in god believe also in me in
[33:18] my father's house there are many
[33:20] mansions if it were not so i would have
[33:22] told you i go to prepare a place for you
[33:25] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[33:27] i will come again and receive you unto
[33:29] myself
[33:30] that where i am there you may be also
[33:34] and whether i go you know and the way
[33:36] you know thomas said unto him lord we
[33:40] know not whether thou goest and how can
[33:42] we know the way
[33:43] jesus saith unto him i am the way
[33:46] the truth and the life no man cometh
[33:49] unto the father but by me amen god bless
[33:52] you this evening
[33:53] god bless the reading of the word be
[33:55] seated
[34:01] brother
[34:06] in the message the identified christ of
[34:08] all ages
[34:11] brother branham says
[34:13] a man
[34:14] he knows he comes from the beyond
[34:17] and a dark shadowy curtain that hangs
[34:19] between him and where he was before he
[34:22] come here and he knows he must go
[34:24] behind that curtain and he is always
[34:28] wanting to know where he come from what
[34:30] he is and where
[34:32] he is going he said we have millions of
[34:34] books
[34:36] millions of volumes that's been wrote on
[34:37] i suppose on the subject but there is
[34:39] only one book and that's 66 volumes of
[34:42] in itself that can tell you where you
[34:45] are where you come from who you are and
[34:48] where you're going and that is the bible
[34:49] it's the word that tells us
[34:51] he tells you where you come from who you
[34:54] are
[34:55] and where you're going
[34:58] so that's what i want to look at because
[35:01] you know
[35:02] there's a lot of things that
[35:04] can be said but
[35:10] i i'm so thankful that
[35:12] god made a made provisions for us yes
[35:19] because you know if it hadn't
[35:22] been for god we wouldn't know
[35:24] who we are where we come from
[35:26] where we're going
[35:28] we wouldn't we would know anything
[35:30] but it's the grace of god that he's that
[35:32] he's allowed us to know these things and
[35:35] he spoke to us and you know
[35:38] as uh the different brothers have been
[35:40] speaking on and
[35:42] you know you know where did where did we
[35:44] come from brother dale's been speaking
[35:46] on that and
[35:47] you know
[35:49] that we we came from god
[35:51] and we're going back to god
[35:53] you know when when god started in the
[35:55] beginning you know he had attributes
[35:57] that he wanted to
[35:58] express he wanted to display his
[36:00] attributes and you know you and i were
[36:02] an attribute of god and and you know
[36:04] that's what we're this displaying today
[36:07] is is that attribute of god
[36:10] that he wants to be expressed in the
[36:12] earth and you know he said before there
[36:13] was anything in the earth and and it was
[36:16] elohim by itself yet we were part of him
[36:21] and you know what
[36:22] we've come back to that place that we
[36:24] where we started
[36:26] we're always a part of god
[36:29] and you know
[36:32] you know we know that when he began to
[36:34] express himself and and began to create
[36:38] and he began to speak these things into
[36:40] existence every part everything that
[36:42] came into existence was an expression of
[36:44] himself
[36:46] you know brother branham said that uh
[36:47] you know there's different different
[36:48] things you know brother ram said at one
[36:50] time he said the first thing was created
[36:52] you know was god himself he said one
[36:54] time he said the first thing that was
[36:55] created was light so one time the first
[36:58] thing that was created was angels and
[37:00] you know all the different things but
[37:01] everything that he created when he began
[37:04] to speak everything was that was spoken
[37:06] was an expression of himself
[37:08] and yet and then but then as he began to
[37:11] express and he began to create the earth
[37:13] and and speak the things upon the earth
[37:15] and it started to come as brothers has
[37:17] talked about you know we saw the light
[37:19] come and then he began to create all the
[37:21] things the botany life and and all the
[37:22] sea life and all the things that he
[37:24] began to express and everything that we
[37:26] saw was an expression of himself but he
[37:28] did not have this full expression of
[37:30] himself that he wanted until man came
[37:33] until he until genesis 1 26 and he said
[37:35] let us make man in our own image and
[37:37] after our likeness and the one thing
[37:39] that he said was he was given man was
[37:41] given a commission he said for us to
[37:43] have dominion
[37:45] we were given dominion over the earth
[37:48] we were given this dominion why because
[37:50] he said he was made man was made a
[37:52] lesser god we were given the the uh
[37:54] dominion over the earth to express god
[37:58] because we were a lesser god so we were
[38:00] to express god in that form on the earth
[38:04] and so we were he said and to subdue it
[38:07] and and to multiply and replenish the
[38:09] earth and you know all these things that
[38:11] god had in his in his perfect order that
[38:13] he had everything they had laid out just
[38:15] as perfect that way he wanted it done
[38:17] and he and he put man here and and man
[38:19] had control of everything that was upon
[38:21] the earth and everything to take place
[38:23] and you know adam was able to come and
[38:25] god put him in flesh and then he was
[38:27] able to
[38:28] uh
[38:29] roll over the earth and everything
[38:31] but you know
[38:32] man got away from what god had put in
[38:34] the place that god had put him
[38:37] god god gave
[38:38] gave man the uh free moral agency to to
[38:42] do as he wanted to do
[38:44] and you know that he was able that he
[38:45] got away from what god had given him
[38:50] and how we've gotten
[38:52] away from these things but yet
[38:55] you know brother branham was talking one
[38:57] time and he was
[38:58] talking about uh man
[39:01] see man
[39:03] and he talks about the earth and and we
[39:05] see how the earth
[39:06] acts today and you know the earth is
[39:09] still
[39:10] following the laws of god
[39:12] and he said he said well it's because
[39:14] the earth is still submissive to the
[39:15] will of god to the word of god it still
[39:17] does the same things every single day
[39:20] and he said man would be would be the
[39:22] same way if he was still submissive to
[39:24] the word of god but the problem is is
[39:26] man's got away from the word of god and
[39:28] they're not submissive to the will of
[39:29] god they're not submissive to the word
[39:31] of god and they wonder why things are in
[39:33] the condition they are but you know when
[39:35] god began to speak everything into
[39:37] existence it was a divine order that was
[39:39] laid out for everything and there's
[39:41] still a divine order in which everything
[39:43] is supposed to go about in this earth
[39:45] and the thing is if you and i still have
[39:47] that ability to reach out and accept and
[39:51] see what the divine order is
[39:54] you know many people have have god has
[39:56] spoken the word into people's lives he's
[39:58] speaking the word to people and you know
[40:00] many people stand up today and they say
[40:02] oh you know if i could have though if i
[40:03] could hear the lord speak to me if i
[40:05] could have if i could hear a word from
[40:07] the lord and people are seeking for
[40:09] things but the problem is is they don't
[40:10] know where to look to find the word of
[40:12] god or to to find the answers from god
[40:15] and and and that's it it's so amazing
[40:18] how how god has tried to reach people
[40:20] and and people don't realize that god is
[40:23] speaking to people and they don't and
[40:24] they just walk right past it and they're
[40:25] just deaf to what he's tried to say to
[40:28] him and you know many times people are
[40:29] looking i'm trying to i want to find a
[40:31] word from god i want to know what god
[40:32] has for me or you know i'm trying to
[40:34] find an answer and i tell everybody well
[40:36] how much time have you spent in this
[40:38] have you looked into the word of god
[40:40] because you know people don't people
[40:42] because he said man should not live by
[40:43] bread alone he said but by every word
[40:45] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[40:47] and you know you're not going to find it
[40:48] anywhere else you're not going to find
[40:50] it on some street corner you're not
[40:52] going to find it in some self-help book
[40:54] you're not going to find it anywhere but
[40:55] you'll find it in those 66 books that
[40:58] that brother brown said that he said it
[41:00] tells you where you start where you're
[41:02] going and where you came from all the
[41:03] answers that you have need lay right
[41:05] here but the problem is is do we read
[41:07] the scripture as we just as brother
[41:09] branham said they read it as a as a
[41:11] historical book and they they read it as
[41:13] a book of philosophy like you know they
[41:16] they're studying uh
[41:18] confucius or or some some great
[41:20] philosopher you know one of the great
[41:22] philosophers of time but you know they
[41:24] don't read it as that is speaking to
[41:26] them they're not reading it as it speaks
[41:29] to you and i this word right here is
[41:31] written to you and i do we read it as
[41:33] that or we just read it that we're going
[41:35] to try to
[41:36] as brother talk about you know we get
[41:38] into the word we're just going to flip
[41:40] back and forth and we're going to try to
[41:41] skim this or that and you know and we're
[41:43] going to try to slice and dice and get
[41:44] what we want out of it instead of
[41:46] reading the scripture for what it says
[41:48] because what it says is what it means
[41:50] there's god god didn't stutter god
[41:52] didn't he's not double-minded he's not
[41:54] he's not confused on anything what he
[41:57] said is what is what he means but the
[41:58] problem is is we will we submit to that
[42:01] and wait for god to speak to us because
[42:03] many times people have read through the
[42:05] scripture and and satan has come and
[42:09] what satan's job is and what he's really
[42:11] good at is getting people confused on
[42:13] what the bible says
[42:15] and many people are still we're still
[42:17] reading it through a carnal mind we're
[42:20] still reading it through carnal-minded
[42:21] eyes and we're still confused on what
[42:23] the bible says we're still reading it
[42:25] through a denominational eyes and so you
[42:28] know we're still confused on but the
[42:30] problem is is there's a way that's made
[42:32] that you and i can come that we can
[42:34] overcome that that we can that god can
[42:36] speak to us through the scripture that
[42:38] we don't have to be confused about what
[42:39] it says
[42:42] we're not to be confused by that
[42:48] i thank god because you know as as
[42:50] brother brahm talks about this is uh
[42:51] this is a love letter
[42:53] this is this is a letter of love that
[42:56] was written to you and i and you know
[42:58] the thing is if it's written to you then
[43:00] you know what then god wants you to
[43:01] understand it
[43:03] then if he's written the scripture to
[43:04] you then then his desire is for you to
[43:06] know what it says
[43:09] so the thing is is you know i don't have
[43:11] to be confused and i don't have to be
[43:13] scared and i don't have to be worried
[43:14] about things i don't have to because you
[43:16] know what god's going to lead me through
[43:18] that
[43:19] god will make known what he has for you
[43:23] but the problem is if i get to the place
[43:25] where i try to figure it out on my own
[43:27] and not wait on him to
[43:28] let me know what it says is for him to
[43:30] speak if i try to figure it out on my
[43:32] own then you know what i get confused i
[43:34] get messed up i get i get displaced
[43:37] everything gets out of out of the wac
[43:39] but there's one thing i can do is have
[43:41] confidence in god of what he's come to
[43:43] do and what he's called me to do and
[43:45] what he's called me for is he's going to
[43:47] bring me to this place that i can have
[43:50] confidence in these things that you know
[43:52] i'm not going to be lost i'm not going
[43:54] to i'm not going to be taken away i
[43:55] can't i can't be separated from god
[43:58] because the scripture tells us that when
[44:00] in romans there he said you know what
[44:02] can separate me from the love of god
[44:06] you know what can separate me from this
[44:09] and he said father who can separate us
[44:11] from the love of god
[44:13] who can separate he said he said will my
[44:16] trials separate me from the love of god
[44:18] he said well there anything is there
[44:19] anything in this world that we know of
[44:21] he said no height no depth no nothing
[44:24] nothing created not not there's nothing
[44:26] seen unseen no matter what it is no
[44:28] matter what comes or goes there's
[44:31] nothing that can separate me from the
[44:32] from the love of god he said he said
[44:34] we've been made more than conquerors
[44:37] through him that loved us so we can have
[44:39] confidence in what he's done why because
[44:41] he he has come to take us all the way
[44:44] through
[44:45] because when when man fell you know what
[44:48] he didn't leave man off by himself
[44:50] somewhere just to deal with things but
[44:52] you know what he came to man
[44:54] and you know he'd already made a
[44:56] provision for man before he fell that
[44:58] there would be a way made and then when
[45:00] then he came to man when when adam and
[45:02] eve fell and they separated themselves
[45:04] from god god didn't stay away but he
[45:06] came looking for adam and he come been
[45:08] calling for adam and it's the same way
[45:09] with you and i you may walk away from
[45:11] god but if you're a son a daughter of
[45:13] god then you know what he comes calling
[45:15] for you he's calling for you he's
[45:17] wanting to have fellowship with you you
[45:20] may try to separate from him but you
[45:21] know what you can be separated from him
[45:24] a true son or daughter of god cannot be
[45:26] separated from him
[45:34] i tell you what
[45:35] like like wade says if this don't stir
[45:38] your soul your spoons fell out of your
[45:39] bowl
[45:40] yes that's right
[45:42] i'm happy to know these things
[45:52] see god
[45:53] in the message messiah brother branham
[45:55] says
[45:56] now when god made man
[45:59] and in genesis 1 26 it shows
[46:01] he said you're putting down scripture
[46:02] genesis 126 he said it shows that man
[46:05] that god made man to be a god to begin
[46:08] with
[46:09] man was made to be a god a lesser god he
[46:11] was made to be in the image and likeness
[46:13] of god he had hands like god he had feet
[46:15] like god eyes ears and intelligence like
[46:17] god his whole fiber because he was a son
[46:19] of god and jesus referred
[46:22] to him as god
[46:24] and so he was talking about he said how
[46:26] can you condemn me saying i'm the son of
[46:28] god is it written your law that you are
[46:29] gods and if they call those gods who the
[46:32] word of god came to how can you condemn
[46:34] me when i say i'm the son of god he was
[46:36] referring to the prophets the anointed
[46:38] ones lester anointed jesus was so
[46:40] anointed that he was more than a prophet
[46:42] jesus was so anointed until he was the
[46:44] fullness of the godhead bodily he was
[46:46] god the prophets had the same kind of
[46:48] anointing only owner only in a lesser
[46:51] condition and jesus in genesis 1 26 when
[46:54] god made man he made him a god because
[46:57] he gave him dominion we and he had
[46:59] rulership he had power over the birds of
[47:01] the air the cattle over the the winds
[47:03] the waves the fishes i see everything he
[47:05] had dominion over everything he was a
[47:07] ruler anointed a ruler because he was in
[47:09] the likeness in the image of god with an
[47:12] earthly domain that's why the bible says
[47:14] the earth is groaning crying waiting for
[47:16] the manifestation of the sons of god the
[47:18] world is waiting for the man to come
[47:21] back
[47:22] into his right estate
[47:25] so god made us
[47:27] god made man to have a dominion over the
[47:29] earth
[47:33] you know because god
[47:36] has you know because if you if you're
[47:38] made in god's image and god is ruling
[47:41] things and then when he made us when he
[47:43] made man to be a ruler also then you
[47:45] know that's that's the expression of god
[47:47] is to be to have that dominion over over
[47:50] the earth and and to do the things that
[47:51] god has called us to do to have that
[47:53] dominion but you know if if we don't
[47:56] walk in that dominion then you know
[47:57] we're not walking into what god has
[47:59] called us to be in that and to have that
[48:01] dominion over over the earth and and you
[48:03] know we see the condition that
[48:05] everything is in today and it's because
[48:08] man has fallen
[48:10] god man has walked away from god but you
[48:12] know he made he's made provision for man
[48:14] to come back
[48:16] and you know we still see all the things
[48:17] that have happened today all the sin and
[48:20] the sorrow the condition that the world
[48:21] is in today we see the falling you know
[48:24] every death that's taken place every
[48:27] heartache all the things that have taken
[48:28] place all of the turmoil the chaos
[48:30] everything has happened in this world
[48:32] it's all because man has come out of
[48:34] from the position that god called him
[48:36] for
[48:37] because you know god called us to be a
[48:39] pos come into a position to be just like
[48:42] him and you know there is no there's no
[48:43] chaos in god there's no confusion in god
[48:46] there's no there's no a mess in god but
[48:49] you know but man has created this mess
[48:52] because he because he wants to be like
[48:54] god just like satan wants to be like god
[48:56] but he doesn't want to follow in the
[48:57] divine order that god laid out and so
[49:00] god is trying to call us back to the
[49:02] place and that's what the word has come
[49:03] as brother bob was talking about this
[49:04] morning the word has come for we can see
[49:07] what the divine order is that we can
[49:09] come back in divine order that we can be
[49:11] just like jesus christ but you've got to
[49:13] come into the headship of the word that
[49:16] you can come to that divine order
[49:22] so god has called us to a position god
[49:25] wants us to be in a certain place
[49:30] and so when when he came when when jesus
[49:34] when he spoke of
[49:36] that one
[49:38] what he told adam and eve when he said
[49:40] he said there would one come
[49:42] and he said he said that he would be the
[49:44] woman's seed would come and he said that
[49:46] he would bruise
[49:49] his head but he said you'll bruise his
[49:51] heel
[49:52] speaking of an atonement that would be
[49:54] made
[49:56] and so you know when you see that what
[49:59] what he came to do the scripture tells
[50:01] us he said that he said
[50:03] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[50:08] in second corinthians who knew no sin
[50:11] that we might be the righteousness of
[50:12] god in him
[50:16] so
[50:16] when there was when there was a fall
[50:18] took place and we were separated from
[50:20] god
[50:22] god came that he loved us so much when
[50:24] we were unlovable that he made a way
[50:26] back that we could be exactly what he
[50:28] was
[50:29] that he became what we were who was no
[50:32] who was not sinful who didn't have any
[50:34] didn't have any faults didn't have any
[50:36] any failures but he came and took on the
[50:38] form of sinful flesh that he could come
[50:40] to be just like you and i that we might
[50:42] be just like him
[50:43] that we can be the righteous brother i'm
[50:45] saying the very righteousness of god in
[50:47] him and many times you know we wonder if
[50:50] you know people don't get the
[50:53] grasp the concept of understanding just
[50:55] exactly who you are
[50:57] because you know jesus didn't come from
[50:59] from glory and lay aside all of the
[51:01] splendor and all the things of heaven
[51:03] and come down to be
[51:05] to be born a virgin in in a manger
[51:08] laying on in over a manure pile to come
[51:11] and feel the heartaches and the pain and
[51:13] the sufferings that you and i have
[51:15] walked to walk the all these years upon
[51:17] the earth and and be the scourge of the
[51:20] society and the community and and not
[51:23] and have a terrible name and all the
[51:24] things that he had suffered and then for
[51:26] to go through all of that and yet he's
[51:29] preached the word to the people to
[51:30] understand there was a kingdom there was
[51:32] a place that he wanted to bring the
[51:34] people he said in my father's house are
[51:36] many mansions and he said i've i've gone
[51:39] to prepare a place for you that where i
[51:42] am you may be also and when he went
[51:44] through all of that and then when he
[51:46] went to calvary and he took those
[51:47] stripes upon his back and he took all
[51:50] that to be beaten to
[51:52] unrecognizable as a human and he took
[51:54] all of that and he carried that cross up
[51:56] the hill to be to be crucified
[52:00] the worst the worst punishment that
[52:02] anyone could suffer when he went through
[52:04] all of that on the cross of calvary and
[52:07] then he wants then he wants us to you
[52:08] and i to come to a place and wonder if
[52:10] we're not worthy
[52:12] well you know what you're not worthy but
[52:13] you know what he loved you so much that
[52:15] you are worthy why because he wouldn't
[52:16] have suffered the way he did he wouldn't
[52:18] have done exactly what he did he
[52:19] wouldn't have come that way and suffered
[52:21] the ridicule and all of the pain and all
[52:24] the agony and everything else so you and
[52:26] i can be to wonder if we're not if we're
[52:28] not if we're not second-class citizens
[52:30] no he came god from heaven the eternal
[52:34] elohim came into flesh and suffered as a
[52:36] human that he could become that we could
[52:39] become the righteousness of god we have
[52:41] become the righteousness of god and you
[52:43] know what he's preached the invitation
[52:46] to you and i to become exactly what he
[52:48] was
[52:49] do exactly what he is
[52:54] you know because
[52:55] you try to share that with people you
[52:57] know what because people do not see who
[52:59] jesus is
[53:03] and people wonder you know satan has
[53:05] sold people a bill of goods that you
[53:07] know trying to make people think they're
[53:09] lower than who they are they think that
[53:11] they don't have access to that but he
[53:14] said come boldly before the throne of
[53:16] grace
[53:17] that if we to make or not our petitions
[53:19] known to him
[53:20] see people wondering so you know why you
[53:22] know what we don't have to be sick
[53:25] we don't have to be afflicted we don't
[53:27] have to why because he took them away
[53:29] from me i don't have to suffer
[53:34] why because there's something inside of
[53:35] me that burns and we need to tell people
[53:37] you know what you don't have to live the
[53:39] same way that you've always lived you
[53:40] don't have to live the way the world
[53:42] does
[53:46] i don't want to live like the world
[53:48] i want to show the world that there's
[53:50] that jesus christ that came when when he
[53:52] suffered all all of the things that all
[53:54] of the humiliation and everything
[53:58] when he was on the cross i was on his
[54:00] mind he wanted me to come to that same
[54:02] place he was he came to if he didn't
[54:04] come to redeem nobody else he'd come to
[54:06] redeem me
[54:10] and and so i want to accept exalt that
[54:12] he hasn't made it in provisions he's
[54:14] made for me
[54:17] i don't i don't want to
[54:19] you know because if we don't accept what
[54:21] he's done for us
[54:24] if he went through all that and you
[54:25] don't accept what he's done for you
[54:28] then you devalue his his sacrifice
[54:32] you devalue what he's done
[54:36] because if he come to do all of that and
[54:39] you know he come to bring you into
[54:41] fellowship with him that you can be a
[54:43] son
[54:44] that's right
[54:46] he's the scripture tells us and romans
[54:48] said that we have become heirs of god
[54:52] and joint heirs with christ
[54:57] well then if we become heirs of god
[55:00] then when we come to the scripture to
[55:01] see what god has done for us
[55:05] then you know what it's ours
[55:09] so when i look in the scripture
[55:12] and there's so many people that when
[55:14] they talk about the atonement and you
[55:16] hear people preach and they and they're
[55:17] trying to they talk about well you know
[55:19] healing is in the atonement
[55:23] but but that's off some somewhere else
[55:25] when when in the sweet by and by we're
[55:27] going we're going to do what all
[55:28] sickness and disease will be done away
[55:30] with and we're just waiting on that
[55:31] great glorious day in the future and all
[55:34] that will be taking place
[55:35] but you know what i don't have to be
[55:37] sick today
[55:41] and you know what i get healed today and
[55:43] be sick tomorrow but you know what i can
[55:45] still be i can still be healed the next
[55:47] day
[55:49] no matter how many because you know
[55:50] we're not we're not immune from problems
[55:53] we're not immune from sickness
[55:55] but the problem is is you know we can be
[55:57] healed
[55:58] because that was that was his that was
[56:00] god's great plan is that he said that
[56:02] when when he came then he wanted those
[56:05] attributes to be displayed so guess what
[56:07] when we get sick
[56:08] then he can be a healer
[56:10] well when we have problems he can be he
[56:13] can be our deliverer when we have all
[56:15] these things that happen he can be he
[56:16] can be our answer he can be he can be
[56:18] our comforter he can he can be our god
[56:21] he can be everything that we have need
[56:22] of he can he can show us everything but
[56:25] that's what he wanted to be displayed so
[56:27] you know if we get sick then everybody's
[56:29] like well you know
[56:31] christians don't get sick
[56:34] christians don't have problems
[56:38] no they don't make us immune from all of
[56:40] that
[56:45] because that's not what god wanted
[56:49] so he
[56:51] because if if he was he couldn't show
[56:53] his attributes if we were
[56:57] if we were free from all that
[56:59] but the thing is is when we have those
[57:02] problems when these things come and
[57:03] guess what we can be brought
[57:05] and be made free from those things
[57:11] see that's what god he wants us he wants
[57:13] us to see
[57:15] if you if you're sick or if you have a
[57:17] problem whatever it is
[57:19] if you're if you're seeking for the
[57:20] baptism of the holy ghost or whatever it
[57:22] is that you're that you have need of
[57:24] then you know what god wants you to know
[57:26] that it's available
[57:29] brother branham said he said if you were
[57:31] sick today
[57:33] he said he said he and you asked him to
[57:35] heal you he said he couldn't heal you
[57:36] more than he's already done
[57:39] he because he said the price has already
[57:41] been paid the purchase has already been
[57:43] made he said the way has already been
[57:45] made he said but the thing is is you and
[57:47] i got to realize that and accept it
[57:49] why because he said hey brother i'm
[57:51] saying that he would want to get he
[57:52] wants to give us the baptism of the holy
[57:54] ghost more than we want it for ourselves
[57:57] you know sometimes that's hard that's
[57:58] hard to imagine that he wants to give it
[58:00] to us more than we want because
[58:01] sometimes we sit and we struggle and and
[58:04] we and we wrestle with things and we try
[58:05] to figure things out and you know what
[58:06] we don't let god move
[58:10] that's right because we're trying to
[58:12] figure some way that we've got to
[58:14] wrestle or we got to do this so we got
[58:16] to do that but you know we don't walk
[58:18] with god
[58:20] and just trust him
[58:23] because you know what if
[58:25] and it's everything it's it's the whole
[58:27] journey of a christian
[58:31] just walk with god
[58:33] amen
[58:35] and if we just trust him then he can
[58:37] lead us
[58:40] i was thinking about where brother is
[58:42] talking about uh women trying to get
[58:44] trying to have children
[58:46] and you know he said sometimes they get
[58:47] so worked up that there's no way that
[58:48] they can receive right yeah
[58:51] and you know they and so they try to
[58:53] have children and they can't so then
[58:56] when when they end up not pregnant then
[58:58] they then it gets worse and it just
[59:00] becomes a compound
[59:02] problem that they deal with because they
[59:04] get their body gets so worked up because
[59:06] their emotions are so tore up right
[59:09] and he said he was talking about women
[59:12] and sometimes you know they'll you'll
[59:14] see people they'll go out and they'll uh
[59:16] adopt a child
[59:19] and then all of a sudden you know
[59:20] something takes place well all of a
[59:21] sudden she gets her mind off of that
[59:24] sometimes when they adopt a child then
[59:26] all of a sudden she's she's spending
[59:28] time with this child and she's bonding
[59:29] with and everything and then all of a
[59:31] sudden the next thing you know she ends
[59:32] up pregnant
[59:34] well why because she's able to get her
[59:36] mind and her body back to the place
[59:38] where she can receive yeah that's right
[59:40] and many times we get the same thing is
[59:42] you know we're trying to find an answer
[59:44] from god and we're and we get so worked
[59:46] up and we're not putting our faith in
[59:48] god we're trying to work something up
[59:50] physically or mentally you know we're
[59:52] trying to work on this thing we get so
[59:53] worked up and it's like we're not
[59:55] trusting god
[59:59] can you just trust god
[1:00:02] you know because if if if we can if that
[1:00:05] is that is the thing about the new birth
[1:00:07] it's entering into that rest
[1:00:11] so everything when we when we have a a
[1:00:14] promise from god then we can rest in the
[1:00:16] promise of god
[1:00:20] because if we you know many times people
[1:00:22] want to pray about things and we want to
[1:00:24] pray and we just want we want god oh
[1:00:26] lord to do something for us and we just
[1:00:27] want to pray pray and we're just trying
[1:00:29] to work things up
[1:00:31] and many times we have no communion
[1:00:38] like brother dale always tells us you
[1:00:40] know if the lord wakes you up early in
[1:00:41] the morning you wake up you know
[1:00:42] sometimes like okay lord you know talk
[1:00:44] to me
[1:00:47] but you know there's no communion
[1:00:50] you know it's it's like talking to
[1:00:52] certain people you know you you call
[1:00:54] somebody on the phone and and they do
[1:00:56] all the talking which
[1:00:58] i was talking to brother matthew bray
[1:00:59] you know the
[1:01:01] it's probably the last time i was down
[1:01:02] in his church but anyway i saw about you
[1:01:03] talk to brother matthew bray he gets on
[1:01:05] the phone he starts preaching and it's
[1:01:07] like it was really good and i was like i
[1:01:08] just enjoy listening to him i don't have
[1:01:10] to say nothing i just let him talk
[1:01:12] yes that's right so brother matthew told
[1:01:14] me he said well the next time he said
[1:01:15] you call he said i'm not going to say
[1:01:16] nothing i'm going to let you do the
[1:01:17] talking i said no i call because i enjoy
[1:01:20] it
[1:01:23] but you know there's times when when
[1:01:24] when you talk to people you know
[1:01:26] it's that way that they do all the
[1:01:28] talking
[1:01:29] right
[1:01:30] and many times people think well that's
[1:01:32] that's what prayer is
[1:01:36] and it's like no we we pray
[1:01:40] and you know
[1:01:41] so when you pray and you want to commune
[1:01:43] with god
[1:01:46] there's times that i just pray
[1:01:48] and and you know i talk to the lord and
[1:01:50] the next thing i do i just sing
[1:01:53] i don't do nothing else i just sing
[1:01:57] and you know there's times when i'm just
[1:01:58] singing
[1:02:00] that's when the lord will give me
[1:02:01] something
[1:02:03] sometimes it's just a
[1:02:04] word but sometimes you know it's
[1:02:07] something that you enter into
[1:02:09] that you make yourself available that
[1:02:12] god can come speak to you and not and
[1:02:14] not just try to you know
[1:02:17] you know a lot of people they want to
[1:02:19] they want to pray like you know they
[1:02:20] think that praying is uh praying the
[1:02:22] king james prayers you know we got to
[1:02:24] use all the dyes and the dowels and the
[1:02:26] vines and and they and you know all and
[1:02:29] they they think they're they're praying
[1:02:30] some holy prayer because they're using
[1:02:32] certain words and it's just like you
[1:02:34] know lord help me
[1:02:37] you know because god knows what's on on
[1:02:39] your heart you don't have to try to to
[1:02:41] make a flowery prayer to god
[1:02:45] god knows what's on the heart he knows
[1:02:46] he sees he sees more than you know from
[1:02:49] the inside so you don't have to try to
[1:02:51] try to uh impress him
[1:02:56] we're not trying to impress him
[1:02:59] but we just make ourselves known that he
[1:03:01] can he can speak to us
[1:03:07] so
[1:03:10] jesus came
[1:03:15] brother braham says
[1:03:20] he said this is is it not
[1:03:22] it is i be not afraid
[1:03:24] brethren said
[1:03:26] he said then one day there came another
[1:03:28] great warrior he was the warrior of all
[1:03:30] of them jehovah manifested in flesh
[1:03:32] jesus christ
[1:03:34] his son he came down and told them that
[1:03:36] there was a land far beyond this land
[1:03:38] there was a land where men didn't die no
[1:03:40] more and he said there is life after
[1:03:42] death and he told it for three and a
[1:03:44] half years
[1:03:45] then one day he came to kadesh barnea
[1:03:48] where he stood the judgment for all
[1:03:50] for us all the judgment seat of god
[1:03:53] where god poured out
[1:03:54] upon him the iniquity and the penalty
[1:03:56] for our iniquity the wrath of god upon
[1:03:58] him and he bore in his body our sins and
[1:04:01] he crossed the river that we called
[1:04:03] jordan death
[1:04:04] but on easter morning like joshua he
[1:04:07] came back with the evidence man lives
[1:04:09] again after death they thought it was a
[1:04:12] spirit they said feel me a spirit
[1:04:14] doesn't have flesh and bones like i have
[1:04:17] said
[1:04:18] you have something to eat and they gave
[1:04:20] him
[1:04:21] fish and bread
[1:04:22] and he ate it
[1:04:24] and he said i'm i'm going to give you
[1:04:26] the earnest of this land but i'll wait
[1:04:29] up there at jerusalem until you get the
[1:04:31] down payment
[1:04:33] he said so they went up and they
[1:04:35] up there and waited and the earnest was
[1:04:37] sent back at that
[1:04:39] of that land
[1:04:41] and dave and today we enjoy that we are
[1:04:44] now reckoning ourselves dead and buried
[1:04:45] with him in baptism we are raised with
[1:04:47] him spiritually speaking we are now
[1:04:49] tonight setting in heavenly places in
[1:04:51] christ jesus raised up with him
[1:04:54] we are now in the body of christ first
[1:04:57] corinthians 12 said we are by one spirit
[1:04:59] we're all baptized into one body by what
[1:05:01] that's the earnest of our inheritance we
[1:05:03] already got the down payment on it but
[1:05:06] we know that we've passed from death
[1:05:07] unto life we look back and see where we
[1:05:10] once were and where we are now there's
[1:05:13] sin in the world down there we've raised
[1:05:15] above it sitting with him our king in
[1:05:18] heavenly places in christ jesus what an
[1:05:21] evidence and not even death itself when
[1:05:23] a great warrior paul come to face it he
[1:05:26] screamed oh death where is your sting oh
[1:05:28] grave where is your victory but thanks
[1:05:30] be to god who gives us the victory
[1:05:33] through
[1:05:34] our lord jesus christ
[1:05:37] amen
[1:05:40] i'm so thankful that we've been given
[1:05:42] that victory
[1:05:44] so
[1:05:45] you know he came and we conquered
[1:05:48] he conquered these things and he come
[1:05:50] and to bring us
[1:05:51] eternal life to carry us but and he's
[1:05:53] given us the evidence of this he said it
[1:05:55] was the earnest of our inheritance and
[1:05:58] so you know i'm so glad that we know
[1:06:00] that we we are sealed until the day of
[1:06:02] our redemption
[1:06:04] because you know he took up all this
[1:06:06] upon himself that he can come back and
[1:06:08] he wants to show us
[1:06:10] and and proved us that that we have
[1:06:12] overcome and that's what you have to do
[1:06:15] and you know we see the we wonder why we
[1:06:17] have problems in the different things
[1:06:19] that come our way why because it's god
[1:06:20] showing us who we are and what god has
[1:06:23] done and you know and you know we see
[1:06:25] that the world the condition the world
[1:06:27] is in today but i thank god that god has
[1:06:29] made a way to show us that we've
[1:06:31] overcome all these things and you know
[1:06:33] you know people people wonder how you
[1:06:35] know the condition that the world is in
[1:06:37] and how things are going but i'm so glad
[1:06:39] you know i i we have an evidence
[1:06:43] we have an assurance that you know what
[1:06:44] this is not the end and you know what i
[1:06:46] thank god because now is the time that
[1:06:49] the
[1:06:50] world is falling apart and it's getting
[1:06:52] close but god has made a way for you and
[1:06:54] i to see that we have and we can have
[1:06:57] that assurance
[1:07:00] that you know we don't have to stay here
[1:07:02] we don't have to live under the under
[1:07:04] the curse of the world and and all these
[1:07:05] things why because god has brought us to
[1:07:07] a place and he's made us daughters and
[1:07:10] sons of god and he's brought us above
[1:07:12] this and we are sitting today now in
[1:07:14] heavenly places the weekly that we can
[1:07:17] sit in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:07:22] so
[1:07:24] we see these things and
[1:07:26] you know we see how the
[1:07:30] the world has come into the condition
[1:07:31] that it's sin and all the things that
[1:07:33] has happened and
[1:07:35] but you know god has has brought to us
[1:07:39] his life
[1:07:42] and you know when you when you see that
[1:07:43] the life of god has come to you
[1:07:47] you know there's a there's a there's a
[1:07:49] journey that a christian
[1:07:52] goes on to you know god carries you on
[1:07:54] this when you when you first hear this
[1:07:56] hear the word and and realize you know
[1:07:58] you're not who you are supposed to be
[1:08:05] that you don't you know
[1:08:07] many there's many people in the world
[1:08:08] today and and you see them and and
[1:08:11] people grow up and you know they are out
[1:08:13] there and they they say well you know i
[1:08:16] have always grown up in this family
[1:08:20] and you know and they said well you know
[1:08:22] i don't look like anybody in the family
[1:08:26] and you know and so they they wonder why
[1:08:28] things are so they they don't have the
[1:08:30] mannerisms that people do and you know
[1:08:32] they have questions about where they
[1:08:34] came from and you and now everybody does
[1:08:36] dna
[1:08:38] and you know many times you'll find on
[1:08:40] on the news where people you know they
[1:08:41] wonder why why i'm not like a certain
[1:08:44] person you know they say you know they
[1:08:45] have these questions about things well
[1:08:47] you know all of a sudden they take a dna
[1:08:49] test and you know they've lived in a
[1:08:51] family all these years and they've known
[1:08:52] these people and they've been called by
[1:08:54] a certain name and all these things and
[1:08:56] all of a sudden one day they take a dna
[1:08:58] test and come to find out you know what
[1:08:59] they're not related to these people
[1:09:02] you know they're not they don't have the
[1:09:03] same last name all of a sudden they come
[1:09:05] to find out they're somebody else
[1:09:08] you know they have they have another
[1:09:10] family and and they they realize hey you
[1:09:12] know i look and all of a sudden they
[1:09:13] meet somebody who's like hey you know
[1:09:14] what i look like them i talk like them
[1:09:17] there's all these connections to these
[1:09:19] people one because they who where they
[1:09:21] grew up that wasn't who they were
[1:09:24] you know as brother i'm talking about
[1:09:25] that
[1:09:26] eagle in the in the chicken yard there
[1:09:28] was that
[1:09:29] that eagle walking around you know he
[1:09:31] didn't understand anything about digging
[1:09:33] in a manure pile
[1:09:34] he didn't understand about that thing he
[1:09:36] didn't understand that mama chicken
[1:09:38] clucking he said it didn't it was not a
[1:09:40] language that he was a familiar with
[1:09:42] it didn't speak to him
[1:09:44] but you know you know it's the same way
[1:09:46] with you and i there there's a and and
[1:09:48] you know as brother bob was talking
[1:09:50] about this morning everybody wants to
[1:09:51] say that it was just you know we just
[1:09:53] come to a realization what we always
[1:09:55] were
[1:09:57] but you know there was a day that you
[1:09:59] realize you know what god spoke to you
[1:10:01] and you realize you know what i'm not
[1:10:04] where i ought to be
[1:10:05] there comes a day you realize you know
[1:10:07] what i'm a sinner
[1:10:09] i realize today that that i am not in
[1:10:12] the right fellowship with god
[1:10:15] that you know what god made a provision
[1:10:17] for me god made a way for me that i
[1:10:19] don't have to live in sin
[1:10:21] there was a way that made that covered
[1:10:23] that chasm between man and god and his
[1:10:25] name was jesus christ and he came to
[1:10:28] make a way that i can become what he is
[1:10:33] and so that i can receive and i realize
[1:10:35] that you know my sins can be covered
[1:10:38] that i can become justified and there's
[1:10:41] a way that that i can repent and and be
[1:10:44] baptized
[1:10:45] that's right
[1:10:47] because the scripture tells me he said
[1:10:49] to repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:10:51] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[1:10:55] that i can see you know what there was a
[1:10:57] way made and i realized that i'm a
[1:10:58] sinner and that i can change that i can
[1:11:01] become a son of god
[1:11:04] that i can repent and be baptized
[1:11:07] then brother branham said after that the
[1:11:09] holy spirit begins to work on you and
[1:11:10] realize you know what you need to get
[1:11:12] rid of the things of the past
[1:11:14] the old nature that you have has to be
[1:11:17] gone
[1:11:18] and he begins to work on you to get rid
[1:11:20] of the old to become sanctified to do
[1:11:22] away with that old man
[1:11:25] for you to overcome that and then when
[1:11:26] you come through that place a journey of
[1:11:28] sanctification then he said the baptism
[1:11:31] of the holy ghost will come and fill you
[1:11:33] that you can be filled by the holy ghost
[1:11:36] and then when you realize that you've
[1:11:38] come through that journey that you
[1:11:39] recite realize that the same life that
[1:11:41] lays inside of you today is the same
[1:11:44] life that walked in on the shores of
[1:11:46] galilee was the same life that lays
[1:11:48] inside of you is the same life that
[1:11:50] stepped out on nothing and began to
[1:11:52] speak and say let there be let there be
[1:11:54] and created the world amen
[1:11:58] and you know what he came to you that
[1:12:00] you might be what he is
[1:12:03] [Music]
[1:12:05] that you and i can be the sons and
[1:12:07] daughters of god what does that mean
[1:12:09] what does it mean to be a son what does
[1:12:11] it mean to be a daughter what does it
[1:12:12] mean to be the offspring of god
[1:12:16] what does that mean it means that you
[1:12:18] are what he is
[1:12:20] so when when you know you know he never
[1:12:22] walked in a place when when jesus walked
[1:12:25] down the earth you know what there never
[1:12:26] was a funeral
[1:12:28] he raised the dead right
[1:12:31] you know what there never was a time
[1:12:33] that he was defeated by the devil by the
[1:12:35] word
[1:12:38] when the pharisees and and and all even
[1:12:40] when satan come to tempting and when
[1:12:42] they when he brought the word to him
[1:12:44] then you know what jesus brought satan
[1:12:46] right back to the word and told him
[1:12:49] he said man shall i live by bread alone
[1:12:51] but by every word of the percent of the
[1:12:52] mouth of god he showed it he said he
[1:12:54] said you know and when he talked about
[1:12:56] showing him the world and all the things
[1:12:57] that was going to take place and all of
[1:12:59] the all of the great worlds and the
[1:13:01] kingdoms and everything that was going
[1:13:03] to take place why jesus jesus wasn't
[1:13:05] going to bow to satan in that time why
[1:13:08] because he realized he was already the
[1:13:10] one that made it and he was already the
[1:13:12] ruler of it
[1:13:14] amen
[1:13:15] well satan satan was just here for a
[1:13:17] little while sure satan what brother
[1:13:18] brahm said satan jesus knew that he was
[1:13:20] the ruler of the world he was the king
[1:13:22] of the world
[1:13:23] he was ruling but you know what he only
[1:13:25] had a space of time in which he's able
[1:13:27] to do his and then after that it goes
[1:13:29] right back to god
[1:13:34] see he wasn't going to fall for satan's
[1:13:36] lie
[1:13:39] why because he knew he was already going
[1:13:40] to be the ruler of it
[1:13:44] see satan and satan trying to trying to
[1:13:46] put something over on jesus jesus
[1:13:48] realizes satan there was a day that
[1:13:50] satan's going to be bound
[1:13:53] and then he'll be done away with you
[1:13:59] so you know we don't have to bow down
[1:14:01] and worry
[1:14:02] one because he's just a bluff
[1:14:07] see
[1:14:09] death is just a bluff
[1:14:12] well because when jesus died and he rose
[1:14:15] again
[1:14:17] then when he rose what'd he do he said i
[1:14:19] conquered death hell in the grave
[1:14:21] so when he took the keys of death hell
[1:14:23] and then he didn't
[1:14:25] satan don't even have a key to his own
[1:14:27] house
[1:14:28] he hasn't he has no more dominion
[1:14:31] who allows him to have dominion who
[1:14:33] allows him to have rulership over
[1:14:35] anything
[1:14:37] there's nothing that can come to you as
[1:14:39] a son or a daughter of god unless god
[1:14:41] allows it that's right
[1:14:43] and the only other time that god is that
[1:14:46] satan is able to allow to touch a son or
[1:14:48] daughter of god is when we get away from
[1:14:50] the word
[1:14:51] when we when we step out from behind the
[1:14:53] fortification of the word then satan has
[1:14:55] his way with us
[1:14:58] but you know as long as we have as long
[1:14:59] as we stand fortified behind the word
[1:15:02] and what god has given us then you know
[1:15:03] what satan has no power over us
[1:15:07] why because he comes to buffett us he
[1:15:10] comes to press us but he can't overcome
[1:15:12] us
[1:15:22] so we can overcome we are overcomers but
[1:15:25] we have to realize that you know satan
[1:15:27] is coming
[1:15:29] and he's going to press you to see
[1:15:31] what your testimony is going to be
[1:15:35] to find out what you're actually going
[1:15:36] to believe you actually stand and claim
[1:15:39] what is what your god-given right is
[1:15:41] what god has given you are you going to
[1:15:43] claim that
[1:15:56] brother brown says
[1:16:00] this is from
[1:16:02] things that are to be
[1:16:05] and he was
[1:16:06] he speaks and says
[1:16:10] scroll down see
[1:16:12] yeah just keep on scrolling down we're
[1:16:13] going to skip some of this he said the
[1:16:14] likeness and all the things that he did
[1:16:16] expresses the things that are to come
[1:16:19] just as the body gives you here just as
[1:16:21] this body he gave you to live and only
[1:16:24] expresses that there is one that is
[1:16:25] greater yet to come see if we bear we
[1:16:28] have borne the image of the earth we
[1:16:30] have also we will also bear the image of
[1:16:32] the heavenly which holds no evils in
[1:16:35] this one that is to come now this one
[1:16:39] does hold evil and sickness and sorrow
[1:16:44] and he's talking about as he was
[1:16:46] preaching in transferring the power of
[1:16:48] transformation
[1:16:50] but if you skip down he says but the
[1:16:52] world had sinned
[1:16:54] so the penalty of sin was death and he
[1:16:56] had to die
[1:16:58] and that's why god was manifested in
[1:17:00] flesh so he could take sin on him to pay
[1:17:02] the penalty there's nothing
[1:17:06] i see there's nothing to come back it's
[1:17:08] not earmarked it's absolutely freely
[1:17:10] paid all the debt is paid it belongs
[1:17:14] there it is belongs to him now and we
[1:17:17] are delegates of his kingdom assembled
[1:17:18] here together tonight in the name of
[1:17:21] jesus christ settingly sitting in
[1:17:23] heavenly places
[1:17:28] so
[1:17:28] you know he's he's paid the debt for us
[1:17:31] and he's brought us into this
[1:17:33] heaven and heavenly places that he's
[1:17:35] brought us to
[1:17:38] but you know even because because of the
[1:17:40] fall you know god has taken up residence
[1:17:42] on the inside the soul of man
[1:17:46] but you know we still the devil still
[1:17:48] has that that attack on the flesh he can
[1:17:51] still buffet the flesh and he can still
[1:17:53] still put
[1:17:54] things on the flesh
[1:17:56] and we still live in this world and
[1:17:58] still uh
[1:18:00] have to be subject to the things of this
[1:18:02] world
[1:18:05] you know brother brown talks about
[1:18:06] living in a pest house
[1:18:09] and he was talking about you know a pest
[1:18:11] house is you know a place where they put
[1:18:13] diseased people and you live in and
[1:18:16] you're living in this pest house and
[1:18:17] we've many times have always talked
[1:18:20] about living in this pest house
[1:18:22] here we are living in this in this realm
[1:18:24] living in these bodies and still getting
[1:18:26] old and and all the things that we have
[1:18:28] to go through to get tired get hungry
[1:18:30] all the things
[1:18:31] that we have to face in here but
[1:18:34] he said it was just showing us that
[1:18:36] there's a land
[1:18:38] well you know what we're not going to
[1:18:39] get sick anymore we're not going to get
[1:18:41] tired anymore we're not going to have
[1:18:42] any more heartaches we're not going to
[1:18:44] have any death there because because
[1:18:46] we're going to be free with all from all
[1:18:48] of these
[1:18:49] these things that living in this past
[1:18:51] house but he said he said but i've gone
[1:18:53] to a place to prepare for you a place in
[1:18:56] my father's house because you know
[1:18:58] there's a place in my father's house he
[1:19:00] said you know
[1:19:01] it's a perfect place
[1:19:03] and he said there's a perfect place and
[1:19:05] he said perfect people go to live there
[1:19:08] and he said you know all the things that
[1:19:09] are perfect there and you know and
[1:19:11] everything is is just absolute
[1:19:12] perfection and and he said you know then
[1:19:14] we we have this place that there's a
[1:19:16] perfect bride that's going to be living
[1:19:18] in a perfect place and he said where
[1:19:20] i've gone he said he said i want you to
[1:19:22] know that he said i'm going to prepare a
[1:19:24] place for you that where i am you may be
[1:19:26] also
[1:19:27] and you know that's when thomas asked
[1:19:29] him you know lord
[1:19:30] where where is this place and how are we
[1:19:32] going to get there
[1:19:34] and jesus said i am the way
[1:19:36] he is the way and you know what if he
[1:19:38] started out on this journey and he's
[1:19:40] brought you to this place and you know
[1:19:41] what he's going to carry you all the way
[1:19:43] through
[1:19:44] because he started you on this journey
[1:19:46] that you're going to go all the way
[1:19:47] through from beginning to end and so you
[1:19:49] know if you've started on this journey
[1:19:51] and he's brought you to this place and
[1:19:53] he's put you in in this place of
[1:19:55] heavenly places or you're standing today
[1:19:57] in heavenly places that you that you can
[1:20:00] go from here and he's going to continue
[1:20:02] on because if he started this good work
[1:20:03] he's going to continue on with it
[1:20:06] and you know we when we see that we're
[1:20:08] living in this pest house but you know
[1:20:09] what there's a there's a day coming
[1:20:11] where we can lay down this this pest
[1:20:14] house
[1:20:15] there's coming a day when you know these
[1:20:17] all these earthly things are going to
[1:20:18] pass away you know as the scripture
[1:20:21] tells us you know
[1:20:22] it's not it's not a it's not a bad thing
[1:20:24] if if a believer passes from here
[1:20:28] you know because paul said you know in
[1:20:30] first thessalonians you know he talks
[1:20:32] about he said you know i don't want you
[1:20:34] to be ignorant of those that sleep yeah
[1:20:37] and he said those that are asleep in
[1:20:39] jesus
[1:20:41] so you know you know there is no death
[1:20:43] to a saint when when you've already died
[1:20:45] to your old man the old man has died
[1:20:47] you've died to yourself that he might
[1:20:49] live that he's taken up residence in you
[1:20:51] through the new birth and you know what
[1:20:52] there is no more death because death
[1:20:55] death may come to you but you know what
[1:20:57] their death can't take you death can
[1:20:59] only carry you into the presence of god
[1:21:02] so there is no there is no you know
[1:21:04] because you know brother and talked
[1:21:05] about you there's a lot of fear and
[1:21:08] things that are associated with death
[1:21:10] but you know what a real true son a
[1:21:12] daughter of god there is no death there
[1:21:14] is no fear because you know what he'd
[1:21:16] come to take all that away from us
[1:21:19] because he wants us to realize you know
[1:21:20] if we pass from this realm into the
[1:21:22] other realm then you know what it's just
[1:21:24] it's just one breath here and the next
[1:21:26] one we're in their mortality there's
[1:21:28] just one breath here and we're stepping
[1:21:30] into incorruption you know there's just
[1:21:31] one breath here and then we're stepping
[1:21:33] into eternity and you know what it's
[1:21:35] just we're walking from here to there
[1:21:36] and many times people worry about what's
[1:21:38] going to take place but you know what
[1:21:40] there is a trust there is an assurance
[1:21:42] that we have in him it doesn't matter
[1:21:44] whether we have to go by the grave or we
[1:21:46] can just walk by through a body change
[1:21:48] and leave here but you know what when we
[1:21:50] go through that thing then you know what
[1:21:52] it doesn't matter god has made a way and
[1:21:54] god has always has already made the way
[1:21:57] and made it perfect for us to pass
[1:21:59] through
[1:22:01] you know you know
[1:22:03] as we were in the hospital with dad and
[1:22:05] you know dad really couldn't communicate
[1:22:07] with us or anything like that but you
[1:22:08] know you know it's it's a it's a great
[1:22:10] thing to realize that when when you know
[1:22:12] you don't want to lose loved ones but
[1:22:13] you know what it's a wonderful thing to
[1:22:15] realize when they get ready to cross
[1:22:16] over they know where you know where
[1:22:18] they're going
[1:22:20] when they can when they step up to that
[1:22:21] jar that place you know there is it's a
[1:22:23] it's a sad time and there's heartache
[1:22:25] and everything like that but praise god
[1:22:27] there's a place where you know what when
[1:22:29] you when you get ready at the end of
[1:22:30] your journey and you get ready to cross
[1:22:32] over let me tell you there's there's the
[1:22:34] wonders and splendors of heaven there's
[1:22:36] things the bible tells us that i have
[1:22:37] not seen ear not heard never neither has
[1:22:40] it entered into the heart of man
[1:22:43] our mental faculties cannot imagine what
[1:22:46] how great it is when we step out of this
[1:22:48] realm into that realm
[1:22:50] people don't realize how great it is and
[1:22:52] you know what when we when we leave here
[1:22:54] we go over there and they're waiting on
[1:22:56] us then praise god you know that's a
[1:22:58] wonderful thing you know because you
[1:22:59] know what there's no more sickness
[1:23:01] there's no more disease there's no more
[1:23:02] heartache but you know what i you know
[1:23:04] if we do that then that's wonderful and
[1:23:06] i praise god that we know where the
[1:23:08] saints are when they step into that
[1:23:09] sixth dimension but you know what it
[1:23:11] gives us it gives something to me
[1:23:13] because it puts a fire in me why because
[1:23:16] it's it's stirring me why because it's
[1:23:17] you and i we've got to come to the place
[1:23:19] that we are going to fulfill all that
[1:23:21] god has for us to do that we can walk
[1:23:24] and walk in the word and realize what
[1:23:26] god has done for us and given us the
[1:23:28] word that we can take a body change one
[1:23:30] because it has been spoken
[1:23:38] you know if the
[1:23:41] if this if this body
[1:23:43] goes to the earth
[1:23:45] this earthly house of this tabernacle is
[1:23:47] dissolved
[1:23:48] he said we have one
[1:23:50] not made with hands
[1:23:52] eternal in the heavens
[1:23:54] so we've already he's already got
[1:23:56] provision made for us
[1:24:02] but the thing is is
[1:24:06] have we made the provision you know
[1:24:08] because people you have to know
[1:24:11] as brother bob was talking about this
[1:24:13] morning we need to know where we stand
[1:24:15] with god
[1:24:18] you need to you need to have the
[1:24:20] assurance
[1:24:22] brother ram said you you need to make
[1:24:23] sure that you have a reservation have
[1:24:25] you made reservations for that place
[1:24:29] because you know we can we can walk
[1:24:32] have the assurance to walk in that to
[1:24:35] continue in that
[1:24:36] we need to walk in what god has given us
[1:24:40] can we continue in the word
[1:24:44] and he said he said because he's given
[1:24:46] us this word and he's brought us to a
[1:24:47] place that you and i can have assurance
[1:24:49] of where we stand
[1:24:52] he's already he's already conquered and
[1:24:53] he's made it away and then we can hold
[1:24:55] on he said a true believer holds on to
[1:24:57] the word that god has given us
[1:24:59] we have that assurance to hold on to
[1:25:01] what god has given us do you hold on to
[1:25:04] what god has given you and realize you
[1:25:05] know i can i can hold on i can walk and
[1:25:08] be confident in what god's done for me
[1:25:10] because it's not what i've done it's not
[1:25:12] it's not the goodness of me it's the
[1:25:14] goodness of god that he's brought us to
[1:25:15] this place you know if we come to this
[1:25:18] place and we can have assurance of where
[1:25:19] we stand and then you know we just walk
[1:25:22] with god
[1:25:23] and if we come into that places brother
[1:25:25] bob was talking about this morning when
[1:25:27] we come into that place where god has
[1:25:29] called us to and we have that assurance
[1:25:31] that we stand to know where we're
[1:25:32] standing at today that we're sons and
[1:25:34] daughters of god that we have been
[1:25:36] sealed until the day of our redemption
[1:25:38] then we begin to walk with god and if
[1:25:40] god is leading us that god will lead us
[1:25:42] as he was up talking about the
[1:25:44] statue of a perfect man you know then
[1:25:46] then you know you just add to your faith
[1:25:49] virtue and virtue knowledge and all
[1:25:51] these things is god is leading you
[1:25:52] through these things he's leading you
[1:25:54] and adding these things to you and then
[1:25:56] he said
[1:25:57] he said for an entrance
[1:26:00] shall be ministered unto you into that
[1:26:02] everlasting kingdom so there's a you
[1:26:04] know because these things is what's
[1:26:05] going to carry you all the way through
[1:26:08] is to continue in the word as long as
[1:26:10] you're here god the reason god has you
[1:26:12] here is for a reason god has you for a
[1:26:14] reason here when you finish your journey
[1:26:16] it's god's going to take you home but
[1:26:19] the thing is as long as you're here then
[1:26:20] you know what we're supposed to be
[1:26:21] walking in the word and and adding
[1:26:23] adding through this
[1:26:25] every day you know stepping into the end
[1:26:27] of the perfect image of jesus christ not
[1:26:30] and not taking a step back or not trying
[1:26:32] to stand still but to continue walking
[1:26:34] in that continuing the walking in the
[1:26:36] word and seeing one because god if god's
[1:26:39] called you then you know there's a place
[1:26:40] that god has called you to come to then
[1:26:42] you know what that's what you and i have
[1:26:44] to do is keep walking be faithful in
[1:26:46] what god has called us to do you know
[1:26:48] you know we don't know how long we're
[1:26:50] going to be here what god's called us to
[1:26:51] but you know we don't all have to come
[1:26:53] to the same place but the one thing we
[1:26:55] do have to do is be faithful in what god
[1:26:57] has called us to do the same place that
[1:26:59] god has called us that we can walk and
[1:27:02] be faithful in what god has called us to
[1:27:04] be
[1:27:10] because god has given us
[1:27:13] his life to lead us
[1:27:18] so if god has given us his word he's
[1:27:21] given us his life then you know what
[1:27:24] the life that he's given us
[1:27:27] will may we'll make it we'll make be
[1:27:29] made manifest
[1:27:32] you know because
[1:27:34] he said as brother i was talking about
[1:27:35] you know the different different ones he
[1:27:37] said you know if i had the spirit of
[1:27:38] beethoven
[1:27:40] then you know i would do the things that
[1:27:41] beethoven done and and the different
[1:27:43] ones but he said you know if i have the
[1:27:45] spirit of jesus christ if i have the
[1:27:47] life of jesus christ then you know what
[1:27:48] the things that jesus done will be made
[1:27:51] manifest
[1:27:54] then you know what if if i as paul said
[1:27:56] it's no longer i that lived now well you
[1:27:58] know what if i just allow because you
[1:28:01] know we try to we try to wrestle with
[1:28:03] things and and we get in god's way but
[1:28:05] you know what if we allow the life
[1:28:07] that's inside of us
[1:28:10] then you know what we can overcome
[1:28:14] that jesus christ be made manifest
[1:28:17] the same life
[1:28:19] that
[1:28:20] that spoke walked out on nothing and
[1:28:22] spoke everything into existence
[1:28:25] the same life that came
[1:28:29] and never had a funeral service
[1:28:33] the same the same one that all through
[1:28:35] the scripture that came and
[1:28:38] done all the all the miracles and all
[1:28:40] the things
[1:28:42] it's the same life
[1:28:47] that so if it was the same life that
[1:28:48] come into you and i then you know we
[1:28:50] don't have to live
[1:28:52] below our standards
[1:28:54] god has given us this
[1:28:58] that we have come to this place
[1:29:02] so the thing is is we have to
[1:29:05] continue to press the battle
[1:29:08] god has called us from the pest house
[1:29:10] but he's called us
[1:29:12] to his house
[1:29:14] he's made to prepare a place for us that
[1:29:16] we can we can leave here
[1:29:21] and all you think you think all the
[1:29:22] years that that has been going on and
[1:29:24] you know god has a desire for you to
[1:29:28] come to the place that he wants you to
[1:29:29] be he wants to fellowship with you
[1:29:32] you know there's a day that you know you
[1:29:34] think about eternity god living in
[1:29:37] eternity here he is the the great
[1:29:39] eternity and then there's this one
[1:29:41] little expanse of time
[1:29:44] that we're here
[1:29:47] we came from eternity
[1:29:49] and we've come down here in earth
[1:29:53] we're spiritual beings
[1:29:56] living a
[1:29:57] a natural life in time
[1:29:59] but we're going back to be spiritual
[1:30:00] beings again
[1:30:02] going back to eternity
[1:30:06] you know what and we don't we don't know
[1:30:08] how long it's going to be but we know
[1:30:09] it's a short time but you god wants us
[1:30:11] to come that's what god's calling us
[1:30:13] home
[1:30:15] god has a desire for us to come back
[1:30:19] for us to to you know we have to
[1:30:22] live in these pest houses and do all
[1:30:24] these natural things but you know what
[1:30:26] god wants us to get ready
[1:30:29] because you know
[1:30:31] if you if you have you know you think
[1:30:34] even having children
[1:30:37] you know
[1:30:38] and your children are gone and you don't
[1:30:40] see them for a while or whatever you
[1:30:42] know there's a desire to see your
[1:30:43] children
[1:30:47] and you know you can you can talk to
[1:30:48] your children on the phone
[1:30:51] and you can
[1:30:52] facetime them and and everything like
[1:30:54] that but let me tell you what when your
[1:30:55] children are gone there's nothing like
[1:30:57] having your children with you
[1:31:02] and how much more
[1:31:04] with jesus christ
[1:31:06] you know because he's one day you know
[1:31:08] we all get to be just like him
[1:31:11] and we can all fellowship with him
[1:31:13] and you know there won't be any more
[1:31:15] time and won't be any more heartaches or
[1:31:17] anything like that because we'll be just
[1:31:19] like him
[1:31:22] we'll have a body just like under his
[1:31:24] glorious body
[1:31:34] see
[1:31:37] this is from
[1:31:38] god making a promise
[1:31:41] brother branham says
[1:31:42] a real born-again
[1:31:44] child of god looks to heaven and knows
[1:31:46] that father holds the reigns of all
[1:31:47] things he does all things well and
[1:31:50] there's neither death nor sorrow for a
[1:31:52] christian
[1:31:53] christians doesn't die
[1:31:56] there's not one scripture that says a
[1:31:58] christian dies
[1:31:59] very vice versa jesus said he couldn't
[1:32:03] die if you believed on him so he has no
[1:32:05] death and that is the greatest
[1:32:08] thing that put fear over man was death
[1:32:10] jesus died for us and death is swallowed
[1:32:13] up in victory so when coming to the end
[1:32:16] of the road like saint paul said o death
[1:32:19] where is thy sting o grave where is thy
[1:32:21] victory
[1:32:22] but said thanks to be to god who gives
[1:32:25] us the victory
[1:32:26] through our lord jesus christ
[1:32:29] and from the from the next quote there
[1:32:31] from number 12 this is from a message
[1:32:34] from that time and he's talking about
[1:32:35] when a bee stings deeply it loses
[1:32:38] stinger honey bee insect things got a
[1:32:40] stinger when it stings the flesh anchors
[1:32:42] and pulls the stinger out
[1:32:44] when death met god's death lost its
[1:32:46] stinger and now death has no stinger it
[1:32:49] can buzz and make a noise and say i'll
[1:32:51] take you i'll kill you i'll do this that
[1:32:53] or the other but it has no stinger it
[1:32:55] lost at yonder and calvary
[1:32:57] he said no wonder paul could say when he
[1:32:59] was coming down the end of the road oh
[1:33:01] death where is your stinger oh grave
[1:33:03] where's your victory but thanks be to
[1:33:04] god who gives us the victory through our
[1:33:06] lord jesus christ
[1:33:08] how that from that time death has no
[1:33:10] stinger for the believer christ took the
[1:33:12] sting of death out for the believer
[1:33:15] there's where he was wounded for our
[1:33:16] transgressions bruce for our iniquities
[1:33:18] and the chastisement of our peace was
[1:33:20] upon him with his death we are healed
[1:33:23] from that time satan was stripped of
[1:33:25] everything that he had he's nothing but
[1:33:27] a bluff
[1:33:28] death is a bluff
[1:33:30] it's just a bluff it has no stinger
[1:33:35] and you know
[1:33:38] you know we have we have been
[1:33:42] blessed to realize you know satan's a
[1:33:44] bluff
[1:33:45] and there there is no death for for a
[1:33:47] christian
[1:33:50] and you know what whether whether we
[1:33:51] like paul you know we're going to the
[1:33:53] grave and we lay this body in the grave
[1:33:57] you know there is there is no victory in
[1:33:59] that
[1:34:00] because you know what he can't hold us
[1:34:03] he can take this flesh but he can't take
[1:34:05] he can't take you and i he can't take
[1:34:06] the real person
[1:34:09] and you know
[1:34:10] and also to realize that you know even
[1:34:12] even if we're we're not we don't go to
[1:34:14] the ground
[1:34:16] but you know there's a group that's
[1:34:17] going to come to the body change and you
[1:34:20] know what that stinger still doesn't
[1:34:22] have an effect on us you know even if
[1:34:24] you go if you go by the way of the grave
[1:34:25] if you if you make the body change you
[1:34:27] know what death has no victory in it
[1:34:29] satan has no victory he hasn't he has no
[1:34:32] hold on a christian and you know we have
[1:34:34] been given the victory through jesus
[1:34:36] christ and so to realize you know there
[1:34:39] is no there is no death uh
[1:34:41] victory and death you know where where
[1:34:43] is your where is your sting where is
[1:34:44] your victory there is no victory why
[1:34:46] because we have the victory through
[1:34:48] jesus christ we have overcome so you
[1:34:50] know we realize when so when we realize
[1:34:52] that death is just a bluff
[1:34:55] the last the last enemy to be destroyed
[1:34:58] is death
[1:34:59] the last enemy and we're going to
[1:35:01] realize that you know what death by the
[1:35:03] word that has been brought to us by the
[1:35:05] word but through jesus christ we have
[1:35:07] received the word that would bring us to
[1:35:10] a body change that you know what death
[1:35:11] has no hold on us why because it has
[1:35:14] been purchased it has we have been made
[1:35:16] free and that's the next thing is to re
[1:35:18] to uh to receive a revelation to
[1:35:20] understand that god has made us free
[1:35:22] from that
[1:35:24] death death has no hold on us has no
[1:35:26] victory in over us we are free
[1:35:31] and yes all the way down through history
[1:35:33] all the different ones yes
[1:35:36] he was a bluff
[1:35:37] and took them down
[1:35:39] but you know
[1:35:40] thanks be to god that we live in this
[1:35:42] day
[1:35:43] in the end time this is the day in which
[1:35:46] god
[1:35:48] brought the word for us to receive a
[1:35:49] body change
[1:35:56] is uh
[1:35:58] first thessalonians 4 says
[1:36:01] very familiar says but i would not have
[1:36:03] you ignorant brethren concerning them
[1:36:04] which are asleep that you sorrow not
[1:36:07] even as others which have no hope
[1:36:09] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:36:11] rose again even so them also which sleep
[1:36:14] in jesus will god bring with him
[1:36:17] for this we say unto
[1:36:19] unto you by the word of the lord that we
[1:36:21] which are alive and remain unto the
[1:36:23] coming of the lord shall not prevent
[1:36:24] them which are asleep
[1:36:26] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:36:28] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[1:36:30] the archangel and with the trump of god
[1:36:32] and the dead and christ shall rise first
[1:36:35] then we which are alive and reign shall
[1:36:36] be caught up together with him in the
[1:36:38] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[1:36:41] so shall we ever be with the lord
[1:36:43] wherefore comfort one another
[1:36:46] with these words
[1:36:48] i'm so thankful that we have we have
[1:36:50] received that
[1:36:55] why because you know
[1:36:57] you know
[1:36:59] so many people in this world have have
[1:37:01] been you know looking for something and
[1:37:03] but you know i thank god we've had a
[1:37:06] prophet in our day come and tell us you
[1:37:08] know because we have received the shout
[1:37:10] we have received a message in our day
[1:37:12] and it has brought us to the place to
[1:37:14] realize who we are
[1:37:16] where we came from and where we're going
[1:37:19] we have received this word and this word
[1:37:21] is going to bring us through because we
[1:37:23] are going to come to this place
[1:37:26] to receive a body change
[1:37:29] amen
[1:37:30] kind of the community the musicians
[1:37:32] coming you know he said to comfort one
[1:37:34] another with these words we
[1:37:37] received the message in our day to bring
[1:37:39] us to this place
[1:37:41] and he's come to make known these things
[1:37:45] and i'm so thankful that god has given
[1:37:48] us his word
[1:37:55] we live in a we live in a pest house
[1:38:01] but god has made a way that we can
[1:38:04] go to
[1:38:05] a place that he's prepared for us
[1:38:08] i thank god
[1:38:09] it's so good to sit and think about what
[1:38:12] you know because
[1:38:14] god doesn't want us to be here you know
[1:38:16] because this is we have no continuing
[1:38:18] city here
[1:38:19] but we're looking for a city whose
[1:38:21] builder and maker is god

[1:46:40] because some will stand there and say
[1:46:41] lord didn't we
[1:46:43] preach in your name we then we
[1:46:45] prophesied and we do great wonderful
[1:46:47] things in your name
[1:46:50] and you know what

[1:46:53] things
[1:46:57] and he said i never knew you
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:00] that's a sad day
[1:47:03] so

[1:47:30] [Music]
[1:47:32] is jesus christ the lord and savior of
[1:47:34] your life
[1:47:37] because it doesn't matter what else you
[1:47:38] do in this world
[1:47:41] a life that's not lived for jesus christ
[1:47:43] is meaningless
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:48] to share the love of god with people
[1:47:51] whether they accept it or not that's up
[1:47:53] to them
[1:47:55] but we've been given a commission
[1:47:57] to share the love of god with people
[1:48:00] to share with them the way of salvation
[1:48:06] to show the world
[1:48:08] that there is
[1:48:10] a god
[1:48:12] and he's real
[1:48:14] it's not just some fairy tale it's not
[1:48:16] just some idea
[1:48:18] [Music]
[1:48:19] but it's a it's a real place it's a real
[1:48:22] genuine life
[1:48:25] and we are to show those people
[1:48:28] everybody that we come in contact with
[1:48:31] we are to show them jesus christ
[1:48:34] because we are his hands
[1:48:38] we are his feet we are his mouth we are
[1:48:40] his eyes
[1:48:42] this bride is to show jesus christ to
[1:48:45] the world
[1:48:48] and that's and that's our desire to show
[1:48:50] the world who jesus is and he's still
[1:48:53] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:48:56] amen
[1:48:57] [Music]
[1:48:58] yes
[1:49:00] we have our faults and failures and
[1:49:01] we're
[1:49:02] inadequate
[1:49:04] [Music]
[1:49:05] but he said we can do all things through
[1:49:08] christ that strengtheneth us that's
[1:49:10] right
[1:49:10] [Music]
