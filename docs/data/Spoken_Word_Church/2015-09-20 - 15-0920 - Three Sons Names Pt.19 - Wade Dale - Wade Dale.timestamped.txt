[0:04] and it wants to watch and we're going to
[0:10] read it later but Daniel 9.4 and then
[0:16] we're going to go back to here for a
[0:18] second son Dave seventy weeks are
[0:19] determined upon thy people and upon thy
[0:22] holy city now that's going to be key if
[0:24] you've got a Bible look where it says
[0:27] people and the holy city so this Daniel
[0:31] 70 weeks is not just to the people now
[0:33] who has the people the people who is
[0:36] Daniel's people the Jews not in South
[0:39] juice right and what was the holy city
[0:41] Jerusalem so he's talking about the Jews
[0:44] and Jerusalem this seventy weeks of
[0:48] Daniel the restoration of Israel has two
[0:52] parts Daniels people the Jews and the
[0:54] city it's not even to Daniel because
[0:57] later on in chapter 12 God says Daniel
[1:00] rest with your people in other words you
[1:02] know knowledge will increase and and all
[1:05] these things it's going to be at the end
[1:07] time because look what's just run here
[1:12] let's see let's go back verse 21 now
[1:18] Daniels praying and Gabriel comes to him
[1:21] when at the time of the evening oblation
[1:25] so in the evening time is when this
[1:27] revelation is to be made known all right
[1:31] Gabriel comes in the evening time to
[1:33] Daniel in telling seventy weeks are
[1:37] determined upon down people upon the
[1:39] holy city select two things to finish
[1:41] the transgression make an end of San
[1:43] make reconciliation for iniquity bring
[1:45] everlasting righteousness sylhet
[1:47] division and prophecy and anoint the
[1:49] most holy now that six things six-fold
[1:54] purpose of Daniels be our Gabriel's
[1:56] visit to Daniel know therefore and
[1:59] understand that from the going forth of
[2:02] the commandment to restore and build
[2:03] Jerusalem
[2:04] your city unto them aside of the prince
[2:07] who is that Jesus Christ shall be seven
[2:10] weeks there's one period and threescore
[2:13] in two weeks now what is three scoring
[2:15] two in the Bible three score is 63 x two
[2:19] three times two is six so that's 62
[2:22] weeks got it if I got that same ankle
[2:27] this is going to be the base of the
[2:28] whole way seven weeks and three scoring
[2:31] two weeks what does that add up to 69
[2:35] weeks everybody got that 69 x 70 69 ways
[2:43] all right the street shall be built
[2:45] again in the walls even in trouble as
[2:48] times and after three scoring two weeks
[2:50] after that sixty two week period Joe
[2:52] Messiah be cut off Jesus was crucified
[2:54] all right but not for himself it was it
[2:58] for the people and the people the
[3:00] princess shall come shall destroy the
[3:02] city now who is that friend that's Titus
[3:04] in AD 70 he will come and destroy the
[3:07] city and the Saints where he said he
[3:09] tore everything apart that's why that
[3:11] Israel is trying their best to go back
[3:14] to temple worship but Titus took the
[3:17] menorah he took all those things they're
[3:19] supposed to be set up the original ones
[3:21] and took them to where the Vatican all
[3:24] right took them to the Vatican that's
[3:26] why everyone's going to make a pact with
[3:27] the Vatican to get all these things back
[3:29] so thanks dr. temple or check this is
[3:32] very simple it's happening right now
[3:33] that's really and after three score 2
[3:36] weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not
[3:38] for himself and the people who prances
[3:40] yo come shall destroy a city in the
[3:42] sanctuary and the end there else you'll
[3:43] be able to flow into the end of the ward
[3:45] this way the terminal now if they're 69
[3:48] weeks and the Messiah gets cut off how
[3:51] many more weeks had left to make 70 and
[3:54] he shall confirm the covenant with many
[3:57] for one week that who's that he that's
[3:59] not Jesus Christ because this person
[4:01] breaks the Covenant alright so this must
[4:05] be the Antichrist is my capital age it's
[4:07] a little late and he shall confirm the
[4:10] covenant with me
[4:11] for a half a week oh it says one way and
[4:16] in the midst of the week what is the
[4:20] middle of seven and a half three and a
[4:23] half plus three and a half at seven in
[4:25] the middle of the week in other words
[4:28] after the prophets who prophesied 1260
[4:30] days he shall cause the sacrifice and
[4:32] the oblation to cease in other words
[4:34] amount of sin then enters in the
[4:36] templates that you got to worship me no
[4:39] more temple worship you got to worship
[4:41] me because that's the amount of sin
[4:42] that's the Antichrist the Pope because
[4:45] he's going to cause the sacrifice and
[4:48] oblation isn't offering the seat and for
[4:51] the overspray abomination he shall make
[4:52] it desolate even to the consummation so
[4:55] this is going all the way the
[4:56] consummation and that determines you'll
[4:58] be poured out upon the desolate so you
[5:01] got a seven-week period a sixty two week
[5:07] period make 69 then you've got a
[5:10] one-week period so I'm telling you the
[5:12] Bible doesn't say there's a half week
[5:15] left after the rapture since one week
[5:19] expert brother drowned God of the Bible
[5:21] he can't change the Bible alright we're
[5:24] going to read some quotes it sounds like
[5:26] that he's changing the Bible but he's
[5:28] not he's speaking because remember many
[5:32] times brother Brian will tell us
[5:34] scripture has a compound meaning cuz
[5:37] really people that's not to us there's
[5:41] nothing there is not from 25 to 27
[5:44] speaking nothing of Gentile alright
[5:49] nothing speaks nothing of Gentiles this
[5:52] is all to Jews natural juice siwy
[5:57] spiritualize it because it took 70 weeks
[6:01] for reduction it took six Bowl purpose
[6:05] to get them redeemed it takes six heels
[6:07] to give us Redemption all right so
[6:09] that's a long way down the road so the
[6:11] redemption of Israel and but it can't be
[6:14] just of Israel why do they think so much
[6:17] of that little place called the mosque
[6:18] of Omar that's where the temple
[6:20] original temple was built jesus said in
[6:23] Matthew when you see the abomination in
[6:27] other words the mosque of Omar and I
[6:29] having the world unless the Providence
[6:31] of God how in the world with the Jews
[6:34] allow the Muslims to come in and put a
[6:38] mosque right on the city ground it had
[6:42] to be the Providence of God knowing that
[6:45] that thing's got to be destroyed that's
[6:46] the abomination right there all right
[6:50] the Jews hate that it's like mom and dad
[6:53] were there you know back in the 90s and
[6:55] up under there they're trying to dig far
[6:57] enough them Jews are trying to get so
[6:59] close to get back to temple worship we
[7:03] Gentiles don't need temple worship we
[7:06] know God's already come but they're
[7:07] trying to get back temple worship so in
[7:09] a lifetime the Messiah right so this is
[7:16] all to the Jews but it has implications
[7:17] to you and I because the Mossad did not
[7:21] get cut off for himself what he he was
[7:23] cut off for all of us died for every
[7:26] person Jew Gentile alright so there's
[7:29] your basic of Daniel 70 weeks but now
[7:32] remember to thank people and city people
[7:36] and City you have to separate them once
[7:39] you separate them you can understand
[7:40] down 70 weeks a lot better but the son
[7:44] of David is heir to the throne all right
[7:47] now the son David is not now remember
[7:51] this is the son of God dispensation this
[7:53] is the son of man dispensation just for
[7:56] a little while to give us a body change
[7:59] and take us out of here alright then he
[8:02] goes immediately as the son of David
[8:05] actually goes to the son of God to
[8:07] preach through the two prophets but when
[8:09] they realized who he was who Jesus was
[8:11] we're going to read that next sunday
[8:13] will go back into his eq in places where
[8:15] they they recognize who he is and they
[8:17] weep and cry because they know the
[8:20] Messiah's supposed to come and alive is
[8:22] supposed to come first membra did that
[8:25] series on the five cups of Elijah they
[8:27] literally every year they said
[8:29] up down for Elijah at their meal they go
[8:32] outside and look fifties come if you
[8:34] hadn't come then shut the doors and well
[8:35] next year in the world in their language
[8:38] they say until next year will see the
[8:41] Elijah that we know brother branham the
[8:44] forthcoming of Elijah has already come
[8:48] preach the message and he's gone well
[8:50] they are looking for a lighter he said
[8:52] why if they're often okay runoff
[8:53] remember the fifth coming of Elijah is
[8:57] the spirit of Elijah to the Jews so he
[9:00] is coming before the Messiah comes true
[9:04] hey Matt Moses absolutely CD there you
[9:09] say well they're just far off they're
[9:11] not far off they're closer than we are
[9:13] really as far as literally knowing that
[9:16] something's gotta happen but the Bible's
[9:19] don't tell them you missed him this was
[9:23] who was so you know what to do but what
[9:24] do they do they go into their homes they
[9:26] cry they weep and all that now that
[9:28] we're going to die remember though
[9:30] remember what brother BAM used about
[9:32] Jonas when Joseph revealed himself to
[9:34] his brethren they said all now we're
[9:36] going to get killed and these things are
[9:38] going to happen and you know all these
[9:39] bad things and children said no it was
[9:42] done to preserve life I'm not mad at you
[9:45] Jesus it's not going to be mad at them
[9:47] when he comes at the son of David he's
[9:49] not gonna be mad at them when he comes
[9:50] take him out of here right he's not mad
[9:54] at you he's the one that blinded them so
[9:58] that we could come in the Gentile bride
[10:00] he looked at us and wanted he knew you
[10:02] know what he knew we were a bunch of
[10:05] renegades I'm just gonna ditch his
[10:07] mother brother wait Dale version he knew
[10:10] we were a bunch of renegades we didn't
[10:12] care about nothin we had no you know the
[10:16] Jews they got a this day and this day
[10:19] and this day and you gotta do this and
[10:21] you know you watch the cups and
[10:23] sacrified you know they had an order of
[10:25] everything checked i'll hold onto or him
[10:28] we're just nations bunch of job had to
[10:30] go up you know God knew he had to come
[10:33] to us first he had to get out that
[10:36] Gentile bride first because if he would
[10:38] have took and not blinded those Jews
[10:42] when they said let his blood be on us
[10:44] and our children and he had not blinded
[10:45] them so they could say that they would
[10:48] have accepted them aside and they would
[10:50] for the right room that's just the way I
[10:53] said because what happens is let me just
[10:56] let me just give it to you playing it
[10:57] took from Jesus to this day two thousand
[11:01] years for us to get Jesus right and
[11:03] we're still ain't getting right yet man
[11:06] we're still here once we get him right
[11:08] as when we going to rapture when those
[11:11] two prophets preach they're only gonna
[11:13] preach twelve hundred and sixty days
[11:15] three years they're going to accept this
[11:21] message that we've took even 50 years to
[11:25] try to understand the message and still
[11:27] don't get it right they're going to get
[11:29] the message in three and a half years
[11:30] and they're very rapture so you see how
[11:33] you see how their foundation our
[11:36] foundation is nothing happy-go-lucky or
[11:38] general that's why remember we had he
[11:45] said I've never seen no more faiths even
[11:46] people that you say have faith unless
[11:48] they saw something you mean sign give me
[11:51] up give me this give me that Gentile
[11:53] woman said gaylord the dog the off the
[11:56] table I've never seen a little faith
[11:58] Centurion says look if your amount of
[12:00] authority I'll Atlanta party whatever
[12:02] you say that's what happened he said
[12:04] I've now find no greater faith and Ezra
[12:06] blind because all that there's our life
[12:07] Jews are all going well is he doing side
[12:10] yes he will he did well he what he ain't
[12:12] this and he he's a devil and he see what
[12:15] grow up the Gentiles built on faith
[12:18] that's why Abraham was Gentile he was
[12:20] built on faith believe what God said and
[12:23] that's it because remember when he was
[12:28] here he was the son of man right well
[12:31] the saira Phoenician woman and will not
[12:34] read it because the time her brother
[12:36] adam said that she and in the Bible
[12:38] sorry in Matthew 15 she says thou son of
[12:43] David have mercy on me my child is backs
[12:45] with a devil huh brother Brown said he
[12:47] never even looked at never pay
[12:49] her a bit of attention wine because she
[12:52] had no claims on him gonna go see
[12:57] Johnny's my sister he's my sister in the
[12:59] lord she's a very dear friend of mine
[13:01] but I can't call her why she's not my
[13:03] life I can't manifest myself to life but
[13:06] now I got a live setting here spam I can
[13:08] manifest myself it's definitely because
[13:10] she's my wife same way with Jesus Christ
[13:12] when he comes that's why he couldn't
[13:14] come to the Gentiles and the Jews at the
[13:15] same time everybody got their right hey
[13:19] man he can't do that he he cut the Jews
[13:22] off so he could get a Gentile bride but
[13:25] he said I'll never forgive him so he
[13:26] goes over here any potential backup but
[13:29] during the time he never paid the woman
[13:32] attention now listen but now blind
[13:35] Bartimaeus with the Jew Jesus was
[13:40] walking down the street he says thou son
[13:41] of David have mercy on me will he turn
[13:43] plan he had he had control or he had the
[13:48] manifestation of the son of David
[13:49] children for part of ass blonde
[13:51] bertalanffy right but now the Tsar
[13:53] Phoenician woman she didn't she was a
[13:55] Gentile she was at all he called her a
[13:57] dollar yes alright he called her a doll
[13:59] but she said yeah but we need the crumbs
[14:01] off the master's table he said I've
[14:03] never found when I was like she said
[14:05] Lord good evening she said the Lord even
[14:10] the dogs get the crumbs off the table
[14:12] Brown said when she said the Lord he
[14:16] immediately turned and manifested itself
[14:19] as her Lord but not a son of David
[14:22] that's why that Putin and most people in
[14:25] the message will tell you the Dana 70
[14:27] weeks is off to the Jews a man that's
[14:30] true but if we don't get Redemption
[14:34] first they don't get Redemption so
[14:36] knowing that they are going to be
[14:38] redeemed shows me that I can be redeemed
[14:41] hey excuse me because we're going to be
[14:43] redeemed first sunny guys son of man
[14:47] come in flash Jesus Christ Sonny talk to
[14:50] the church ages and son a man here in
[14:53] the end time and then now he's going to
[14:55] go to the Jews as the Son of God but
[14:57] they're going to see him as a son of
[14:58] David
[15:00] that time of the Ministry of the two
[15:02] prophets will get into all that I'm
[15:03] trying to just lay a background for you
[15:04] to start thinking wheels turning here I
[15:07] just want to let everybody know that the
[15:09] Daniel 70 weeks is so it's such a big
[15:13] topic amongst the message when I was in
[15:16] the car over it was even brought of it
[15:18] okay yeah but is it is it you know about
[15:22] the week so looks like i told you that
[15:25] brother it's in the Bible it said one
[15:27] week right after the massage cut off now
[15:30] my lord when was he cut off a t30 when
[15:34] they killed me then you have a time of
[15:38] the Gentiles then you got one more week
[15:41] left natural week not a ministry week
[15:44] not a tribulation week one week of
[15:48] natural time because that 70 weeks is it
[15:52] was a natural time all right okay thank
[15:56] you because I got to mention this first
[15:58] Daniel with in captivity it was the 68
[16:03] year of his captivity brother Brown said
[16:07] he knew in two more years he read my
[16:09] books we're going to read it next sunday
[16:10] from it he will look back to what
[16:12] Jeremiah God told Jeremiah there would
[16:15] be 70 weeks that they would be in
[16:18] captivity and after that they would go
[16:21] out Daniel had been in captivity brother
[16:24] Graham city wing captivity winds about
[16:26] 12 years old here he is later on in life
[16:29] and he wanted to know that's what he was
[16:31] praying God what how are we going to do
[16:33] this how are we gonna get out what are
[16:35] we gonna do when we get out to bondage
[16:38] and he had two years well well brother
[16:41] brown said Daniel was so Daniel was so
[16:45] intent on knowing that God didn't just
[16:48] show him one there were two years where
[16:49] he showed him all the way to the
[16:51] Millennium all right all right the guy
[16:53] that he might have any questions so far
[16:57] on what we just said really I mean if
[17:00] you do then or something you didn't
[17:02] understand me saying cuz we're going to
[17:03] go through this
[17:04] protects us a year then so what its
[17:06] gonna bring us a year but what you got
[17:07] to do is you got to be intent and focus
[17:10] you have to be intent and focus that we
[17:12] get this right that you because see I
[17:15] can walk up to anybody and a crowd i'm
[17:18] taking thousands and ministers in the
[17:19] message and i stand up feeling like we
[17:21] did it before and challenging because i
[17:26] know what the property god will say it
[17:27] and I know what we gotta have to place
[17:29] this thing is right for it because
[17:31] remember if you nail it down the people
[17:35] in the message don't like this book I
[17:38] had somebody this morning him me a book
[17:41] and says I haven't read this book in a
[17:42] long time I don't read it much you know
[17:46] what they don't understand it you read
[17:48] something you understand yes do you read
[17:50] something you don't understand maybe
[17:52] once right I keep that book Jim's god I
[17:58] keep that one because most people have
[18:00] that book this more wore out really than
[18:03] this when I put this one up the one
[18:04] Jim's got I keep it in my briefcase with
[18:06] my Bible everywhere I go and what's in
[18:09] my Bible is the chart most people don't
[18:13] even know brother drowned chart and I
[18:16] have this for you to have his own now
[18:19] look let me take some about this will
[18:22] hold this up so people that's it brother
[18:25] George Smith himself told me this was
[18:33] typed by Rebecca Rebecca is the one that
[18:36] drew this picture during the series of
[18:38] the day and seventy week because
[18:41] remember brother bouncing baby that
[18:42] looks like a girl never he started
[18:43] talking about the little image they let
[18:45] a girl go then dress all right what's
[18:48] what sister Rebecca did is is later on
[18:50] after them after the service she drew it
[18:53] out and if you'll notice this is old
[18:55] typewriter type to let it go click click
[18:58] big thing that was what was in the 60s
[19:01] so this was grown by william branham so
[19:05] this is not i think people draw charts
[19:07] and charts and charts and they never do
[19:09] why because they can't prove their
[19:11] doctrine with his chart
[19:13] can I do it I've seen other drawings
[19:17] that are not right but I keep a baby
[19:19] with me all the time and there's another
[19:22] one and this was kind of strange run
[19:26] lower ground which is in florida right
[19:30] old brother he's 80-something years old
[19:34] somebody asked he was with another
[19:36] brother now his son brother Keith Brown
[19:38] brought this to us when we were doing a
[19:41] damn seven two weeks eerie hey somebody
[19:45] asked brother branham to draw it again
[19:46] about three or four days later in a
[19:49] restaurant he drew it on a napkin and
[19:52] they made a copy of it if you want to
[19:55] know this is a brother blame Dean he's
[19:58] spoken word Outreach Center drawn by
[20:00] brother william branham for a brother
[20:01] that was at a restaurant with brother
[20:03] venom in 1961 and it's the exact same
[20:07] chart as he drew here ok so there's my
[20:12] confirmation that that chart right and
[20:15] so I have both here they one of each and
[20:21] pass them if you already have one get
[20:23] another one I made 30 of them I thought
[20:25] more people would be here then they are
[20:27] because ok the way you have any charts
[20:30] of the other ones that will have drawn
[20:32] that are a threat uh well the one in the
[20:37] building maleva morning ed eat bad
[20:42] anyway you know say it online ok
[20:47] listen I'm gonna tell you something if
[20:49] we were one word off out of the Garden
[20:52] of Eden we can't be one word off and
[20:53] take a body changes and listen when we
[20:59] hire ministers meeting I didn't do it
[21:02] but I'm gonna do it forever telling us
[21:04] again they don't believe what brother
[21:08] Brown said in this book when they
[21:12] brought their ideas and dare thoughts
[21:14] they never read a quote out of this book
[21:15] right here they always read the quotes
[21:18] out of the church I mean out of the
[21:20] steelbook and and they danced all around
[21:22] it but I want to tell you something and
[21:25] I'll make it plain brother Geoff Jenkins
[21:28] is the one that brought this everybody's
[21:29] attention and he said brother Randall
[21:32] was wrong in Daniel 7 new weeks series
[21:35] and he didn't know what he's talking
[21:37] about couldn't get his dates together
[21:38] right now that same devil is on them
[21:42] people that won't take what's in this
[21:44] book because they're denying what the
[21:47] property God said write you're denying
[21:50] the Prophet I'm one of you because you
[21:53] know brother Graham said in this book
[21:55] seven times that there's one week left
[21:57] after the rapture he says thus saith the
[21:59] Lord was the Lord Rome know they sell
[22:05] well he corrected it in the seals show
[22:07] me where he corrected it show me where
[22:09] he said I was wrong no he kept going
[22:11] back saying man this is why we had to
[22:12] get the damage them to ensure the people
[22:15] misunderstood what he said absolutely
[22:17] cuz he said I misunderstood alright get
[22:19] one of each and then pass to depress
[22:22] them back up keep those they're yours
[22:24] retching a minute and fold it over and
[22:26] put it any day insane two weeks book
[22:27] right but that to me is is the drawing
[22:36] that the properties are drew during the
[22:39] time of the day of 70 week series okay
[22:44] now i'm not trying to i'm not trying to
[22:47] belittle people I'm just trying to tell
[22:49] you this church what we believe because
[22:52] some people have asked and I want you to
[22:55] be able not to say that berlinale
[22:57] I want you to be able to say I can show
[23:01] you in the Bible and I'm show you in the
[23:02] property message was probably go out
[23:04] talking about okay jesus said eat my
[23:07] flesh great my blood jesus said many
[23:10] things somebody was questioning about
[23:14] being a Christian I'm sir okay being a
[23:18] Christian what do you think about men
[23:21] agreed was being kind and nice and good
[23:22] and that's okay Christian is Christ
[23:28] light right be like Christ Christ took a
[23:33] road and drove a bunch of people out of
[23:36] a temple Christ said one day said for
[23:41] say father mother sister brother and
[23:43] follow me Christ said one day let the
[23:49] dead bury the dead christ said one day
[23:54] he said you generation of vipers you
[23:57] snakes and he stood up in a minister's
[23:59] meeting and call them all hypocrites now
[24:02] boy it's like brother Brown said he said
[24:04] if you looked at the kind old priests
[24:05] they looked at Jesus he said you'd pick
[24:06] the Congo priests every time but what
[24:09] happened was Christ is doing it out of
[24:10] love okay so that's what I'm saying
[24:14] Christ can do this out of love that he
[24:16] can show us what the prophet of God was
[24:18] talking about in the Daniel him two
[24:20] weeks ago cuz truly back to their full
[24:23] club the son of david has nothing to do
[24:26] with with the gentile the son of David
[24:30] was a promise and we'll carried on that
[24:32] sunny the son of David was a promise
[24:34] that God said that David come he loved
[24:36] David so much he said David your son
[24:38] will sit and judge the twelve tribes of
[24:41] Israel when I sure Solomon did it in the
[24:44] natural but he had a flaw okay remember
[24:48] the end of Sullivan's life he got he got
[24:50] a hold of two women and they turned him
[24:52] into idolatry and that's human that's
[24:55] cause you did not withhold ago and it's
[24:56] all alright but now this one to come had
[25:02] to live a word inside of him that was
[25:05] the son of David that the Bible was
[25:06] talking about
[25:06] right which was Jesus Christ now son
[25:09] David have mercy on me Bartimaeus got
[25:13] what he asked for sorry Phoenician woman
[25:15] it wasn't time yet for her to be calling
[25:20] him the son of David alright so in the
[25:23] Millennium when we all come back and
[25:24] there were things over the Jews have
[25:26] been restored the temple has been
[25:28] restored and all these things he's going
[25:31] to sit he's an heir to the throne he is
[25:34] going to sit in the Millennium remember
[25:36] the Millennium it's not to us Jen and I
[25:40] got married and then we went on at
[25:42] anyone a week or so Heyman right okay so
[25:45] that's what Jesus he we marry him here
[25:49] we go on a honeymoon for a thousand
[25:52] years we're there and letting the Jews
[25:56] fulfill all that Old Testament Jeremiah
[25:59] Ezekiel Daniel all those things for the
[26:02] juice those Gus said I'll never forget
[26:04] you I'll never forget to do he can't
[26:06] forget though they've got people they
[26:07] were God's original bride so he's going
[26:11] to bestow all the things look I don't
[26:13] now they're getting killed and people
[26:15] hated you but one day that 144,000 and
[26:19] all the Jews from all the ages are going
[26:22] to be in that millennium in that temple
[26:24] around that temple and Jesus Christ is
[26:28] gonna sit on that throne and its Brides
[26:30] going to be around him and we're going
[26:32] to be there from any moon there's
[26:33] nothing I mean listen people literally
[26:35] they're still in time the Millennium is
[26:38] a time element it's not an eternal
[26:41] element it's a time element because
[26:43] what's going to happen is we're going to
[26:44] be taken away God's going to rain fire
[26:47] and burn everything off again and then
[26:49] the new city is going to come down where
[26:50] everybody's going to live for an
[26:51] eternity so the Millennium is the space
[26:53] of time one thousand years okay but
[26:57] there is things that goes on that we
[26:58] gotta get to the Millennium let me give
[27:01] you this point if the six mo purpose are
[27:05] the six seals remember programs and 60s
[27:07] finishes redemption for the seven seals
[27:09] Jesus Christ all right so six seals
[27:11] finishes Redemption so does the six fold
[27:14] purpose
[27:15] redemption for Israel and then they
[27:18] accept Christ and we all go in the
[27:20] William so whatever takes us in the
[27:21] millennium has got to take the Jews into
[27:23] the Millennium all right got that so
[27:25] just think about that and run around in
[27:27] your head for up for the rest of the
[27:29] time but the son of David is not to the
[27:31] Gentile it's only to the Jew but the
[27:34] benefit we get is we've already married
[27:36] to this guy that's right we're married
[27:40] to it right where his bride even the
[27:43] hundred forty four thousand that's not
[27:44] as bright their units their unix they're
[27:47] there to what to minister to us right to
[27:50] help us and it not be cervix like
[27:53] servants but they are like you know me
[27:59] and Jim husband a while but sister Trudy
[28:00] she's good friend of ours she you know
[28:02] things we do all together but she's not
[28:04] my bride because she's my sister and the
[28:07] Lord she's my sister but she can't claim
[28:09] me as husband in the Millennium then
[28:11] claim him as what King David the son of
[28:14] David Jesus Christ sitting on the throne
[28:17] that's their king but his bride is going
[28:21] to be us sitting around the chrome
[28:22] because theme we accept this it you're
[28:25] now they rejected him and then they're
[28:27] going to have to be what give their life
[28:28] and all those things for that so it may
[28:31] any question real quick before we go yes
[28:35] if we don't understand
[28:39] read the first part right here first
[28:43] part of that foot the forward that's
[28:46] exactly what he said the reason is the
[28:50] reason that so important is is the
[28:52] placing of the seals the placing of the
[28:56] plays and the vowels in the woods is to
[28:58] placing sure you can get an
[29:01] understanding of the seal no problem and
[29:03] not understand Daniel 7 new weeks but
[29:05] you can't get the full revelation of
[29:07] what those seals are about unless you
[29:09] get the full revelation of what nine
[29:11] seven two weeks is about this what do
[29:12] you say good look if you can't
[29:14] understand the redemption of the Jews
[29:15] you can't understand your full
[29:16] redemption that's why we're burying
[29:19] people we don't understand a full part
[29:21] of redemption I mean let's just be
[29:22] honest we don't understand the full part
[29:25] of redemption and listen we all don't
[29:28] because love this thing is getting old
[29:31] that's why me and brother Darrell was
[29:33] talking about Jesus God Himself got old
[29:36] everyday anyone that he didn't
[29:38] understand he was just born in this
[29:39] world brother round look like he's 70
[29:42] years old with you 56 years old when he
[29:44] died that's my age I'll be 56 in January
[29:48] he looked like he was 70 years old one
[29:51] cuz it beat this thing up this thing
[29:53] right here is what's going to have to
[29:55] change the seals changes this body
[29:57] period if don't take a body changing you
[30:00] can forget about 19 a week but since
[30:03] it's already in the Bible and it's
[30:05] already turned and some have already
[30:07] made it then let's back up we got to be
[30:10] redeemed body spirit oh okay
[30:14] and he said his other dude well all the
[30:18] Jews are blinded not just gonna see
[30:20] 144,000 so they excel the message they
[30:23] weren't allowed when Jesus was born it
[30:25] was his people because we're going to
[30:26] read it next Sunday the Jew said let his
[30:29] blood be on us and our children so what
[30:33] our generation but there's a generation
[30:36] that's promise we'll be in Revelations
[30:39] then there's going to be twelve thousand
[30:41] from each tribe brought out and given
[30:44] eternal life all right or give them two
[30:46] wholly-owned all right same thing okay
[30:48] let's go brother Darryl Willis your name
[30:51] n'oublie show
