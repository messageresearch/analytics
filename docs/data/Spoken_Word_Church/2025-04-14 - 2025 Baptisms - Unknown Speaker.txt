========================================

I'm sorry, brother. [Music] I [Music] didn't mind. You don't mind? All right, brother. Um, brother Boyd, how about um opening a service with prayer for, please, sir? Bless. for the opportunity to witness a baptism of a young person and we just pray that it humbles us enough that we walk in that light be an example to this and we stand before you and we bless these children with our prayers. Yeah. and our comforting words that time of need that they may have. So, thank you for Zoe and we encourage her to walk in the will of the Lord and thy word and continue to be blessed in her life throughout the rest of her walk in Jesus Christ's name as a witness. I pray and thank you. Amen. That's right, brother. A witness. All right, let's read our scripture. All the neighbors watch through the window. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid? How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein? That's pretty powerful. Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death. Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death. that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father, even so we also should walk in newness of life because we're going to the planting, burial, death. She repented. God's going to kill her, which is not a bad thing when God does that. He raised you back up. But we're going to we're not going to leave her there. We're bringing her back up in newness of life. Something that she had never had done before. And now she's having this done. And it's a testimony to here and the neighbors and everybody else that it's an act of faith that she's going to have that she's going to continue on and continue to walk. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection. Knowing this that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we also or shall also live with him. Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more. Death hath no more dominion over him. Praise God. Amen. For in that he died, he died unto sin one time. Once at Calvary. Doesn't have to die again. We just got to believe he did. He died for me. He didn't die for you. He died for me. You got to believe he died for you. Last wise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof. Neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield yourself unto God as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. It's a confession, an outward showing that she stepped into a new part of her life. We want to pray for our sister and we're going to everybody just like the dedication. Everybody's going to live this. Hug her neck. She's wet. So be it. But tell her tell her tell her God bless you. Thank you for that step you just took. Many won't take that step because they got pride. They got all these different things. But she's taking that step to the world to let the world know that she's passed from death into life. I am going with me. I am bound for the promised land. What is our promised land? The baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's what brother Ram said. That's our homeland is to be born again and to start in a watery grave. Well, we don't have to die anymore. He's died for us already. Wow. What a It doesn't matter if we have to physically die. That doesn't mean anything. You pass from death unto life if you have Jesus Christ in your soul. You can't die. There's nothing on this earth can kill you. There's nothing any in another dimension that can kill you. It's what God's done for you. It's our sister Joey Urego has come to give a profession of her faith. We sure appreciate our young sister and what she does for the church and we're just really proud to be able to baptize her and give her Lord. He sees this. Your Lord sees this. The Lord Jesus sees this whole thing. He knew it before the foundation of the world this was going to happen. And we sure are proud of you. We're proud of what you do. proud of the things you stand for, too. You spend a lot of time practicing where a lot of people don't want video games and all that other stuff. Hello, somebody. And you're practicing so you can play in front of the bride and be a part of the bride. And we sure do appreciate that. So, to fulfill the great commission, Jesus told us in Matthew, he said, "Go into all the world, preach the gospel, baptizing all new converts in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Thank God for truth. So now I baptize our sister in the only Christian baptism there is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Applause] Proud of her. Pray for her. to draw. What did you think? Pray for them. The devil's on all of our young kids trying But I believe if we'll just keep them in the word of the Lord. Yes. And she made this profession. Glad to have her cous with us today. Good to have you with us, sister. You're Deanna's kid. Are you Deanna? Yeah, Diana's job. That's his sister. Good to have her with us today. So, um, anybody else? Water's warm. Lord's here. All minds clear. Come on, man. I knew it. Come on. [Applause] Come on, bud. Our brother's been coming to church a few times and kind of got a little bit regular. So, and he's a friend of Levis's. And you might Are you with him today? Yeah. Oh, well, you're going to get his little car wet. That's the one. Praise the Lord. Oh, I know. I told myself. Oh, you never Okay. All right. Now, brother, he's made a confession. And I pretty much knew this was going to happen. So, uh, God bless you, man. We see the Lord working on your life. So, just continue to let him in. All right. If you have questions, we're all here to answer the questions. You got big brother Aaron over there that'll help you and Levi and all too. We We all We're family. Listen, we speak the same language. Amen. We all speak the same language. It's a heavenly language that the world don't understand sometimes. And our brother has come in and heard that language and he don't and he didn't didn't shy away from it. He come back. Amen. So in the profession of his faith according to what Jesus told all his disciples to go into the world, preach the gospel, baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. I baptize our brother Yeah. in in the name of the Lord. Let you say it. Jesus Christ. [Applause] A lot of you have stood in this same maybe not in this same pool but several different places around the country and and made your uh profession. Now I pray that our brother makes that confession that he's going to continue to walk but walk with God. not walk as the scripture says in the elements of sin but walk in the newness of life because sin goes this way the eternal life goes this way so that's why you need to repent turn around that's why the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to fulfill that great commission step up here a little bit don't get on that just step up there you go our brothers made a confession he said asked a couple Sundays ago, he want to be baptized. So, we just do not ever want to uh to not anytime baptize anyone. So, to fulfill the great commission and our brother has made a confession of faith that he wants all of you to see that he's going to be baptized today. So, to fulfill the great commission that Jesus said, I read it just a few minutes ago. He said, "Go teach and baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost." So to fulfill that great commission, we're going to baptize our brother Joseph Mumbo in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Applause]
