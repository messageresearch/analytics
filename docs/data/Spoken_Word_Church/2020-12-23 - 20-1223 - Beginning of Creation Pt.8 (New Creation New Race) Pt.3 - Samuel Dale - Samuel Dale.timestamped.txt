[1:37] up here
[1:38] you know so it'd be fine good to see
[1:41] everybody if you'd like to turn into
[1:42] scriptures
[1:42] turn to revelations 3 14
[1:47] where we've been reading from and then
[1:50] we'll go to genesis 1
[1:51] and genesis 2. try to pick up her
[1:54] thought and continue on
[1:56] to what we've been doing remember to
[1:58] pray for all of these
[2:00] remember brother uh homer to pray for
[2:02] him the lord would
[2:04] touch him and all and all the others
[2:07] talked to brother russ
[2:08] dunker today and i told him it's a
[2:10] strange
[2:11] prayer that we would pray because you
[2:13] know we pray
[2:15] uh christmas we won't snow you know we
[2:18] like to have but we don't go out and
[2:20] pray for it that much but they do
[2:23] because where they're at they need a lot
[2:26] of snow
[2:28] and everything you know i mean just foot
[2:31] after foot after foot of snow just
[2:32] continually
[2:34] and they like the snow really just start
[2:35] and go all the way through
[2:37] the whole winter just about it because
[2:38] it makes everything grow better
[2:40] and stuff like that so i said well we'll
[2:42] pray that the lord will send you some
[2:44] snow now we don't know how many feet
[2:46] you're going to get
[2:48] because we're going to just pray for the
[2:49] lord to to do that so remember brother
[2:52] uh duncan and all he greets everybody in
[2:54] the name of the lord
[2:55] amen any other announcements or anything
[3:00] that we have okay father we thank you
[3:02] for this day in your grace we thank you
[3:04] for
[3:05] calvary thank you for loving us lord
[3:08] thank you for guiding us and keeping us
[3:10] and we pray that you would just be with
[3:12] each and every one of us
[3:14] remember all of the sick among us lord
[3:16] and different things father that
[3:18] come upon us and all but we ask you to
[3:21] just
[3:22] cover it through the blood and let
[3:24] everything be all right
[3:25] uh remember the little bride around the
[3:27] world all of the
[3:29] little parts of the bride everywhere and
[3:31] satan fighting on every hand
[3:33] trying to conquer us and all but we know
[3:36] that we're already victorious no matter
[3:38] what happens
[3:40] coming or going we are overcomers and we
[3:43] believe you
[3:44] we love you and we thank you have your
[3:46] way now bless each one remember brother
[3:47] homer lord and touch him
[3:49] deliver that and these others in jesus
[3:51] name
[3:52] amen and we'll just take the three
[3:57] i think about three scriptures generally
[4:00] revelation 3 14
[4:01] and unto the angel of the church of the
[4:03] lady of sian's right
[4:05] these things saith the amen the faithful
[4:07] and true witness
[4:09] the beginning of the creation of god
[4:11] amen
[4:12] now we've been on that for a while and
[4:14] we'll probably stay on it a while but uh
[4:17] just uh pray the lord would bless us um
[4:20] maybe i won't be like we've listened to
[4:22] the day we're brought around i'm talking
[4:23] about
[4:24] the lady said he had had him on the ice
[4:26] heap job and
[4:28] you know keep on but i guess that's
[4:30] that's one way of doing it but
[4:32] you know let's go to genesis 1 26
[4:36] and god said let us make man in our
[4:38] image
[4:40] after our likeness and let them have
[4:41] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[4:43] over the fowl of the earth
[4:45] and over the cattle and over all the
[4:47] earth and over every creeping thing that
[4:49] creepeth upon the earth
[4:51] so god created man in his own image in
[4:54] the image of god created
[4:56] he him male and female created he
[5:00] them now we jump on over maybe we'll get
[5:04] to here tonight but we'll see uh verse
[5:07] go to genesis 2 7 and the lord god
[5:10] formed man
[5:12] of the dust of the ground and breathed
[5:14] into his nostrils
[5:16] the breath of life and he became a
[5:19] living
[5:19] soul you may be seated lord add his
[5:22] blessing
[5:22] to the reading of the word now
[5:29] the thought that we've been having is
[5:32] the three stages of creation
[5:37] and trying to bring that out to get us a
[5:40] little better understanding of what's
[5:42] going on and
[5:43] life and stuff like that and we covered
[5:47] uh two services so far onto that and the
[5:52] last one was really a
[5:53] a corrective form not that we were wrong
[5:57] but
[5:58] uh to bring it out that the first stage
[6:01] of our creation we know the first stage
[6:04] of christ was god himself
[6:07] not that god created god you know or god
[6:10] created
[6:11] jesus and jesus created you know this
[6:14] that or the other
[6:15] the bible says all things were made by
[6:17] him without him
[6:18] was not anything made that was made so
[6:21] there's there's just one creator there's
[6:23] not
[6:24] three creators we're not dealing with a
[6:26] a three-part creation or something you
[6:28] know
[6:29] we're dealing with a point of of just
[6:32] saying
[6:32] uh the phases or stages
[6:36] of creation should bring each one of us
[6:39] to a better understanding of where we're
[6:42] at and what we're doing
[6:44] and the first stage we covered it as i
[6:46] said a couple of messages
[6:48] on the basis that um
[6:51] god came into being not that he was
[6:54] created or
[6:56] somebody created who or what he came
[6:59] into being
[7:00] he he stepped down or began to do as the
[7:04] prophet said
[7:05] to her that human beings could
[7:07] comprehend
[7:09] him understand him in other words so he
[7:13] he just was coming
[7:14] into being and he is always being
[7:18] he didn't have to come into from he
[7:21] didn't have to be created because it
[7:23] always was
[7:24] you know and that was the point so we've
[7:27] been dealing with trying to keep it
[7:29] into that line to see uh the one true
[7:32] and living god
[7:34] is what we're dealing with you know and
[7:37] seeing how god
[7:38] unveiled himself down to mankind
[7:42] and and bringing it into being that man
[7:45] could see or understand god
[7:49] all right see then in doing that then uh
[7:52] we know that god was a spiritual
[7:55] if you want to talk about creations or
[7:57] whatever you want to
[7:58] use your terminologies about it
[8:02] that he was first spirit being
[8:06] god is a spirit see
[8:10] no man has seen god at any time
[8:13] because he is a spirit all right see
[8:16] then being that spirit he
[8:18] he is eternal and always was eternal
[8:22] you know and it's a spiritual being that
[8:26] you're talking about that
[8:27] was always existed and he existed alone
[8:32] all right and being alone then he was
[8:34] lonely
[8:36] and he wanted something to uh
[8:39] be like him and also then he
[8:42] creates and genesis 1 picks up and there
[8:45] you've got the genesis 1 26
[8:47] man that he says let us make man in our
[8:51] image and our likeness and let them have
[8:53] dominion over the
[8:54] fish and the all right then now comes in
[8:57] the
[8:58] part that that's still part of now the
[9:00] first creation
[9:02] or the first phase i use terms and i'm
[9:05] sorry i don't have the education
[9:07] and if i say something it don't fit
[9:09] right you just race that out and
[9:11] put it over in another little pocket and
[9:14] and answer your own question
[9:16] you know because i just just try the
[9:18] best that i can
[9:20] what we see as i said now we see god
[9:23] is a spirit all right you can't see a
[9:26] spirit
[9:29] he never is doing that's what he's
[9:31] trying to do
[9:33] he's trying to come into being to where
[9:36] he can be comprehended
[9:38] are seen or understood
[9:42] so he begins to descend toward the human
[9:45] to what you know we would be and as he
[9:48] does
[9:49] see we see that he is a spiritual being
[9:53] all right so what would be the next part
[9:56] that would still be
[9:57] part of stage one of your creation
[10:01] would be adam as being in the image of
[10:04] god
[10:06] all right and having him to be what a
[10:10] spiritual being
[10:12] adams see in his first creation
[10:15] i say first creation because he had to
[10:17] be brought into being in spirit realm
[10:20] and then i hope we get far enough in
[10:22] tonight to understand
[10:24] that he came into being in a physical
[10:27] realm
[10:29] all right but now i want you to keep in
[10:31] mind because
[10:32] i really don't know how i'm going to be
[10:34] able to explain it
[10:36] but remember one thing that
[10:40] adam in a phil in a spiritual
[10:43] creation is in the image of god
[10:46] all right but then adam in a
[10:49] physical creation now physical
[10:54] you know tangible whatever you want to
[10:56] call it 16 elements
[10:58] etc is in a natural creation
[11:02] and that's actually a head of god
[11:06] because god follows adam
[11:11] now there's a scripture we'll get to in
[11:13] a minute that's always
[11:15] bothered me and and everything but it's
[11:17] all right i
[11:19] just try to express it but see
[11:24] the human body of jesus christ
[11:27] didn't come into being until 2000 years
[11:30] ago
[11:33] now the human body so then the human
[11:36] body of adam
[11:39] come into being
[11:43] 6 000 years ago but just get the point
[11:46] of what we're trying to do don't don't
[11:48] get confused just listen
[11:50] and then you uh you come and help me
[11:52] that's
[11:53] that's what i need i need help to
[11:55] express words and things
[11:57] but i believe that god will give us
[12:00] those words to do
[12:02] all right so now what was it god is a
[12:04] spirit
[12:07] okay then what did he create when he
[12:09] created
[12:10] adam a spirit man
[12:14] all right in his own image
[12:17] no spirit man so that he could rule
[12:21] in the garden and do the things but then
[12:24] it would be a while before he would come
[12:26] into being
[12:27] in genesis 2. that's what we've got to
[12:30] get that and keep it separated
[12:32] to where that we can understand where
[12:35] we're at
[12:35] all right so phase one as we've tried to
[12:38] cover
[12:38] that's back before the foundation of the
[12:40] world
[12:43] that was back before anything physically
[12:46] materialistically or or
[12:49] whatever you want to use the word came
[12:51] into being
[12:53] it was a spiritual creation
[12:57] all right god existed alone
[13:01] self-existing but then as he began to
[13:04] condescend downward
[13:06] he becomes more into the spirit realm
[13:09] and we read to you if you need these
[13:11] we've been over and over you should have
[13:13] them
[13:13] you've got them that uh god gave birth
[13:17] to his own son
[13:20] all right not that he gave birth to his
[13:22] son like
[13:23] a birth happened a birth means a coming
[13:26] forth into
[13:28] in other words what you've done when you
[13:30] were birthed
[13:31] see when you come into the world by
[13:33] birth by natural
[13:34] you come forth into a condition that you
[13:38] did not exist before
[13:40] that's right so you just stepped over in
[13:42] so that's what god is doing he's
[13:44] he's condescending to where
[13:47] that we can comprehend him because how
[13:50] could the human being comprehend the
[13:52] great eternal god
[13:54] so you can't do it you can't you can't
[13:57] do that part
[13:58] so he was trying to express himself
[14:01] and as he comes forth he comes forth in
[14:03] a spiritual being
[14:06] all right then see when adam comes forth
[14:09] in his first
[14:11] part or phase of the creation
[14:14] when he comes forth he doesn't come
[14:16] forth as a natural man
[14:19] you know physically uh 16 elements
[14:23] he came forth in a spiritual condition
[14:27] to be exactly like god
[14:30] all right so then when it says that god
[14:32] is a spirit
[14:33] man is a spirit not talking about that
[14:36] we're just spirits of this you're you
[14:38] don't get all this
[14:39] get what i'm talking about get the point
[14:41] that the spirit part of us
[14:44] is that soul that is within us
[14:48] thee all right and the scripture says
[14:50] and the last adam was made to live in
[14:52] soul
[14:54] all right see then we've got to get to
[14:56] that point
[14:57] and i don't want you to i don't want to
[14:59] confuse you but i don't want to
[15:02] leave it to where it can be confusing
[15:04] see
[15:05] because god has wanted to unveil himself
[15:10] he wants to reveal himself to his people
[15:13] and he wants people like himself
[15:17] all right so he wanted to to
[15:20] fellowship so it has to be done in
[15:23] stages
[15:25] so he felt he brings forth man in a
[15:27] spiritual condition
[15:30] adam and eve was made a living soul
[15:33] all right the prophet says blasphemous
[15:36] names
[15:37] that adam had eternal life in his soul
[15:41] all right so then eve would have eternal
[15:44] life in her soul
[15:45] so there would be your spiritual
[15:47] creation
[15:49] and that part came into being before the
[15:51] world ever come into being
[15:55] so you got the the spiritual creation of
[15:58] man
[15:59] and and he he is in a condition to where
[16:02] that he's exactly like god
[16:04] god didn't want dogs and cats and horses
[16:07] and
[16:07] things like that he can fellowship with
[16:09] him but now he wanted something like
[16:12] himself
[16:14] so he started with something like
[16:17] himself what kind of a person would he
[16:19] have been
[16:19] had he just created a flesh
[16:23] for adam
[16:26] there would have been no fellowship
[16:29] because he would still not be something
[16:30] like him so if the bible's true
[16:33] that says let us make man in our own
[16:36] image
[16:38] all right then if we're created in the
[16:40] image of god
[16:41] it is not this man that you're talking
[16:44] about this man will come into being
[16:46] in another stage as we go along
[16:50] you know because if it did you'd be in
[16:52] bad shape
[16:53] because you you got one little person
[16:55] one big person one fat person one skinny
[16:58] person
[17:00] that wouldn't be in the image of god i'm
[17:03] trying not to be too carnal but yet
[17:05] being
[17:06] carnal enough to wear the little donut
[17:08] on you
[17:10] all of us are different sizes and
[17:11] everything else but the natural man see
[17:14] is not
[17:15] in the image of god
[17:18] but the spiritual man
[17:21] which is the very soul the being the
[17:24] person
[17:26] that adam and eve was in genesis 1.
[17:30] all right making them in the image of
[17:33] god
[17:34] in his likeness now he has something to
[17:38] fellowship with
[17:41] right back in the garden i mean back
[17:45] before time ever begun
[17:47] now listen to the story because i'm just
[17:48] trying to to go as i can
[17:51] all right see man come into being before
[17:55] the
[17:55] foundation of the world spiritual man
[17:58] not physical man now no physical man
[18:02] never come into being
[18:03] until you get on over to genesis 2.
[18:06] we'll get to that but spiritual man in
[18:09] the image of god
[18:12] the likeness of god comes forth in
[18:16] before time ever begins
[18:19] and god has something to fellowship with
[18:23] all right now hold on to the point
[18:26] now he still is is not in his right to
[18:28] be state
[18:29] because there's other parts of him in
[18:31] attributes
[18:34] that has not been displayed when you're
[18:37] talking about the thing of man
[18:39] and let us make man and think that
[18:42] you're not in the natural creation
[18:45] you're not into those things so hold on
[18:47] to that
[18:47] back up just a little follow me as i go
[18:51] i i i notice i say that a lot you know
[18:54] because
[18:54] what i mean is just just simply try to
[18:57] stay with what i'm talking about
[19:00] don't say well i don't know where he's
[19:02] going he's going over here that's
[19:03] spiritual man that's that's just the man
[19:04] over here that man over there
[19:06] see you run out ahead and you get it all
[19:09] confused
[19:11] and then you blame me well i take my
[19:14] part
[19:16] because i'm confused to start with all
[19:18] right
[19:19] the point of doing is i'm trying to
[19:21] break us away from our confusion
[19:24] you know i'm trying to get us to where
[19:26] we can comprehend
[19:29] all right see there was god
[19:32] dwelling totally alone
[19:38] then he begins to condescend and as he
[19:41] does
[19:41] he comes into the part of making man in
[19:44] a spiritual
[19:46] condition or making an eternal person
[19:51] all right adam and his soul was eternal
[19:54] his body and his spirit was not but now
[19:58] follow that as we go along
[20:00] okay now then as it is adam and eve
[20:03] comes forth in this condition
[20:06] that they could exist before the world
[20:11] right are you following me their
[20:13] existence would be the same as god's
[20:15] existence
[20:17] spiritual being
[20:21] all right they could that's why they
[20:24] could rule the animals
[20:25] the natural man the the genesis there
[20:28] where it talks about that take care of
[20:29] the animals and rule the animals and the
[20:31] things
[20:32] will be under that that never was to be
[20:36] a natural thing
[20:39] that's a spiritual being
[20:42] that's a spiritual part that's a spirit
[20:45] if you've ever seen anybody that do it
[20:48] if you just look at the natural i saw
[20:50] i've told you about it about brother
[20:51] tatum that time that that dog was
[20:54] and and that dog was so mean to uh you
[20:57] know i
[20:58] i i knew that you couldn't trust him
[21:02] so i told my wife and then i said y'all
[21:03] go around behind the truck and
[21:05] the old dog was up in the truck and boy
[21:07] he was old german shepherd he was
[21:09] raising kane
[21:10] and you know and i i was gonna say oh i
[21:13] told him
[21:13] y'all going behind if he jumps i'll try
[21:16] my best to get him off of all of us or
[21:18] do whatever
[21:19] because we're going in the house and
[21:22] about that time brother tatum gets out
[21:23] of the truck or the car he comes walking
[21:25] up
[21:25] and he walks he says why blacky what are
[21:27] you doing just lay down
[21:29] and he just put his hand over and that
[21:30] dog
[21:34] then saw a man up in tennessee up there
[21:39] and he walked right up to a dog and that
[21:42] dog i would have never went within no
[21:44] feet of that dog but he just
[21:47] and he had to do it a couple of times
[21:48] because that dog went after him
[21:51] but in a minute he just walked up
[21:54] and he laid his hand on that dog the dog
[21:57] just laid right down
[22:00] he had met his master not a physical man
[22:03] get me not a physical man
[22:07] there was something else involved there
[22:09] was a spirit involved
[22:13] you know and it may have been just a
[22:14] natural spirit to start with
[22:16] but i've seen that happen it will work
[22:19] all right
[22:19] but now get the point see adam and eve
[22:23] in a spiritual creation
[22:26] back before time began amen
[22:31] all right and that spiritual condition
[22:33] then existed
[22:35] and that brings your your phase one
[22:38] into being to where that we're in the
[22:41] image of
[22:42] god see you are a spiritual creation
[22:47] by the baptism of the holy ghost when we
[22:49] get to that you'll see
[22:50] more what i'm talking about but we are
[22:54] in a spiritual condition
[22:58] by what that god has allowed us to have
[23:02] okay now
[23:05] see then knowing though that's to be
[23:08] true there was parts of god he still did
[23:10] not
[23:11] was not able to get into being uh
[23:14] there in the you know in the spiritual
[23:17] creation
[23:18] because it was not just a spiritual
[23:20] creation did he come to bring
[23:22] it was a spiritual creation in a natural
[23:25] condition
[23:26] how else would you say it because it
[23:28] would go to the natural flesh
[23:30] and the flesh then would would come to
[23:32] that point all right
[23:34] but see adam and eve now get my point
[23:37] they're in ex
[23:38] they're in a condition just not god is
[23:40] in a condition
[23:43] they're in a spiritual condition all
[23:46] right
[23:47] the physical hasn't come into being yet
[23:50] all right
[23:50] see then now watch the part of god's
[23:52] plan he knows right there
[23:55] that would be a wonderful place to stay
[23:58] would be the spiritual condition
[24:02] all right he knows that that would be
[24:04] wonderful but he knows that would not
[24:05] display all of his attributes
[24:08] so he could not bring forth any of the
[24:10] attributes into being he couldn't
[24:12] you know he couldn't do none of those
[24:13] things and it would leave him
[24:15] lonely again he would go back to the
[24:19] existence
[24:21] that we could exist with him and that'd
[24:24] be a wonderful thing
[24:26] but yet still it will not display the
[24:29] attributes
[24:31] because see you've got to go into stage
[24:32] two in creation
[24:34] to think about any form of attributes
[24:39] see all right so then when adam
[24:42] and eve come into being in a spiritual
[24:45] condition
[24:46] they were in the image of god are you
[24:49] with me
[24:50] okay now that would give them eternal
[24:53] life
[24:55] because their body had not come into
[24:57] being yet
[25:01] come on their body was not into being
[25:04] their spiritual part is that what we
[25:06] call the spirit of memory reason
[25:08] conscience etc
[25:09] and all that would not be in existence
[25:11] either so it would be the spiritual
[25:13] condition
[25:14] of the eternal life that god had
[25:18] given to adam and eve
[25:21] okay now a lot of people would argue
[25:23] with me maybe i shouldn't use it
[25:25] so emphasis isn't too much to illustrate
[25:28] but i believe whatever adam had eve had
[25:31] now because that's what your prophet
[25:33] said he said they were one in theophany
[25:35] so that settles that to me now
[25:37] you know but yet i know that people see
[25:39] they'll say well
[25:40] i go along now with adam because
[25:42] blasphemous names
[25:44] i just can't go along with these well
[25:46] i'm sorry uh
[25:48] i i'm one person that
[25:52] i want to be right and i believe it what
[25:55] i'm trying to say
[25:56] is right but see now you've got
[25:59] the spiritual condition you've got your
[26:02] spiritual creation
[26:05] bad words to use you've got your
[26:07] spiritual part of coming into being
[26:12] and now here's what we'll get back to it
[26:14] on predestination
[26:18] see when we get finished up we'll come
[26:20] back to predestination
[26:21] and go through because the prophet said
[26:25] if you wasn't back there
[26:28] before the foundation world you never
[26:31] will be
[26:32] now is that true do i need to bring all
[26:35] those quotes i will when i get to it
[26:38] see but it should be enough that you
[26:40] know that he said he said those things
[26:42] because if you wasn't back there you
[26:43] never will be back there
[26:45] it's not something that the new birth
[26:47] puts us back there
[26:50] no our spiritual being
[26:53] eternal life is just as eternal as he is
[26:59] so in that spiritual condition your soul
[27:01] was eternal
[27:05] the rest of you hadn't come into being
[27:07] yet amen
[27:09] now god is thinking well how do i get
[27:11] all of these other attributes into being
[27:13] now
[27:15] i've got my people i've got my children
[27:19] i've got my offspring in a spiritual
[27:22] condition
[27:23] that exists the same as i do
[27:26] but see now that people would pick up
[27:29] that thought too
[27:30] and they would want to do something else
[27:34] you following me any problem with
[27:37] thinking that if you have eternal life
[27:39] that if god gave you eternal life back
[27:41] before the world
[27:42] would there be any problem with that
[27:43] eternal life in you desiring to be made
[27:45] manifest
[27:47] just as well as it was in almighty god
[27:49] himself
[27:50] because see jesus wasn't in existence
[27:52] the flesh man at that time
[27:55] you you've got to wait until you come
[27:57] and that's what i'm saying
[27:59] you can't bring jesus into a physical
[28:02] condition
[28:03] until four thousand years from the time
[28:06] is
[28:07] it was the creation over to that
[28:10] and he would come into being but adam
[28:13] would start the human race
[28:17] wow to worry they could be attributes
[28:19] displayed
[28:22] jesus the flesh man didn't step out
[28:24] there
[28:28] the flesh man never stepped out there
[28:30] four thousand or six thousand years ago
[28:33] and uh he was a spiritual creation
[28:37] he could create
[28:41] all things were made by him and without
[28:43] in him was not anything made that was
[28:45] made
[28:47] all right what would be the problem then
[28:50] of trying to think about the condition
[28:53] or existence of a human being
[28:55] that eventually will come to the
[28:57] position that they can speak the word
[29:00] just like their father did
[29:03] do you have any trouble with that
[29:08] do you have any trouble with thinking
[29:09] about that you
[29:12] with eternal life
[29:17] you're a child of god
[29:22] if you have eternal life you're a child
[29:25] of god
[29:27] i know it it may be uh and i don't mean
[29:30] to the fact of some that
[29:32] you know hasn't heard a lot i'm saying
[29:34] to all of us have we heard enough
[29:37] of the prophet's message to be able to
[29:39] put it together
[29:40] or are we still like you know when i
[29:43] remember all of the things of
[29:44] predestination and
[29:46] and things that began to do and
[29:47] everybody say i always was eternal
[29:52] i always was eternal
[29:56] well no why are you getting old
[30:00] right if you always was eternal what
[30:03] happened
[30:06] got a problem there seems like it is to
[30:09] me because
[30:11] you know trying to bring this down into
[30:14] a situation to where we can comprehend
[30:21] that that eternal life that you have
[30:24] and i don't believe you come into the
[30:26] world with eternal life
[30:28] on the basis of the way the people of
[30:29] this message try to bring it
[30:32] i don't believe it that way now i
[30:35] believe you started before the world
[30:37] ever begun
[30:39] as a spiritual being
[30:45] and being a spiritual being would
[30:47] automatically make you eternal that's
[30:49] right
[30:50] i believe it that way
[30:54] but then there's things that's that's
[30:57] see when you come up so far you've got
[30:59] to stop and just think for a minute
[31:01] here's god coming and bringing himself
[31:04] in and showing himself and revealing
[31:06] himself
[31:06] into existence and now here's his
[31:09] children coming into existence
[31:12] sure if you have eternal life
[31:18] right amen now if you have eternal life
[31:21] today
[31:21] that eternal life that you have always
[31:24] was eternal
[31:26] right
[31:29] if god was eternal
[31:34] then he always was eternal
[31:38] he said yeah but you're making it a
[31:39] little bit too strong i told you years
[31:42] ago i said one of these days
[31:43] i'll preach to you what i see on
[31:44] predestination well i'm gaining ground
[31:48] i'm getting up to at least a few places
[31:50] that i can see things put together
[31:54] because see i believe if you have
[31:57] eternal life
[31:58] that that eternal life is just as
[32:00] eternal as god's own life
[32:01] because that's whose life it is it is
[32:03] god's own life
[32:05] imparted into you
[32:09] but just don't let them impart it into
[32:11] us too quick
[32:14] don't bring it into us as sinners and
[32:17] let us remind
[32:18] sinners in some kind of an eternal
[32:19] condition
[32:21] because you can't do that
[32:25] that's why when as i'm trying to get to
[32:27] it there god
[32:28] existed alone
[32:32] but yet he had attributes in him
[32:36] now those attributes are getting an
[32:38] opportunity to be able to be displayed
[32:40] and the first attribute to be displayed
[32:43] would be the spiritual man
[32:45] the eternal life that he has
[32:49] it's the first existence all right
[32:54] and see then doing that now you've got
[32:57] to a spot so i'm going to try to move
[32:59] now
[33:02] see adam
[33:06] then steps forth
[33:10] what would be the wording
[33:14] the man adam comes into being
[33:19] the flesh man adam according to genesis
[33:22] 2 right
[33:25] genesis 2 you've got a natural creation
[33:29] true all right see this is one you've
[33:33] got a spiritual creation
[33:35] so now you have the natural creation
[33:38] bring it into being of adam before
[33:41] jesus ever comes into being in a natural
[33:45] condition
[33:50] why you don't think
[33:53] why
[33:56] why would it be that adam
[34:00] looked like jesus would have to come
[34:02] into being i'm talking about flesh
[34:09] no because it would not bring forth the
[34:13] attributes
[34:18] see then adam would step forth
[34:22] in genesis 2 as a natural man
[34:30] now your attributes can be displayed
[34:35] he has to grow he has to to bring forth
[34:38] and
[34:38] and and bring into being but as he does
[34:42] then he'll come to the basis that
[34:46] adam
[34:50] becomes a living soul
[34:53] a human being
[35:02] because get what i'm saying now and
[35:03] listen
[35:05] without adam coming in as the human
[35:07] being first
[35:09] you could not have your attributes
[35:14] displayed
[35:17] you couldn't do that you got to let him
[35:19] come first
[35:22] you got to bring in a natural creation
[35:25] and that's what the scripture says
[35:31] first corinthians 15 46
[35:35] and so it is written the first man
[35:38] adam was made a living soul
[35:45] the last adam
[35:48] was made a quickening spirit
[35:52] now which came first
[35:59] albeit that was not first which is
[36:02] spiritual
[36:04] yet we know it was first
[36:08] but the physical man has to come first
[36:13] spiritual man is part of god but that
[36:16] which
[36:17] is natural
[36:20] and afterward that which is spiritual
[36:25] the first man is of the earth earthy
[36:29] the second man is the lord of glory
[36:35] adam was not the second man jesus christ
[36:38] was the second man
[36:41] the lord of glory adam was the night
[36:44] first natural man
[36:48] now follow me he was made that away
[36:54] to where the attributes could be
[36:55] displayed
[36:57] there would be a capability of the fall
[37:01] with adam coming physically before jesus
[37:06] had jesus come physically first there
[37:08] would have been no fall
[37:11] right don't put no lustful thing in the
[37:14] lord jesus
[37:21] but things can happen in adam
[37:24] there adam
[37:28] was a spiritual being in eternal life in
[37:31] his soul
[37:33] but then god created him a body what'd
[37:36] the prophet say
[37:37] he put the genesis 1
[37:40] man into the genesis 2 man
[37:45] right he put him in there and as he did
[37:49] now you have adam
[37:52] on the earth with eternal life in his
[37:56] soul
[37:57] but he's not got it in his body
[38:02] right adam doesn't have eternal life in
[38:05] his body
[38:08] see because that's that would do away
[38:10] with the condition or existence of the
[38:11] fact that man could fall
[38:15] had jesus come first man couldn't have
[38:17] fallen i'm physically saying it now
[38:19] physically
[38:20] if jesus physically had come first there
[38:23] would have been no ability for a fall to
[38:24] taken place
[38:26] but by bringing adam into existence
[38:31] and making him a natural man
[38:35] not eternal life in his body
[38:39] not eternal life in his spirit part of
[38:41] him of memory reason consequence
[38:43] with eternal life in his soul
[38:47] it's no problem with me i don't know
[38:48] where it would be with you or not
[38:51] and see then the things can start
[38:54] transpiring
[38:57] the fallen condition can come into
[38:59] existence because you have the ability
[39:01] with adam to fall
[39:05] there's no ability of jesus christ to
[39:07] fall
[39:09] but adam could fall and did fall
[39:16] he became a living soul right
[39:20] genesis 1. he had eternal life in his
[39:24] soul
[39:27] but that wasn't in physical being to
[39:29] where the fall could come
[39:31] so then you have to put the man into the
[39:34] genesis 2 man
[39:35] you put that spiritual man over in you
[39:37] don't do away with his eternal life in
[39:39] his soul you don't have to
[39:42] yes but brother dale if you have eternal
[39:44] life you can't fall
[39:46] you can't fall and go to hell but you
[39:48] can sore stoma a whole lot
[39:51] right don't think just because you have
[39:54] eternal life that you can go
[39:56] out and live like the devil now don't
[39:58] talk to me on language that way i ain't
[40:00] talking to you
[40:01] don't talk to me and say well brother
[40:03] dale i can't sin because
[40:05] i'm born again i got what the prophet
[40:09] said there go ahead
[40:10] but just come on back with it the way
[40:12] it's supposed to be
[40:15] what are you understanding
[40:19] i'm trying to do two things one thing
[40:21] bring eternal life into being
[40:25] but on the other hand showing that that
[40:26] eternal life can step into a human body
[40:30] and that body can come forth and display
[40:32] the attributes of almighty god
[40:39] huh adam then was the first
[40:43] physical man
[40:47] jesus was the first spiritual man why
[40:51] because he condescended
[40:54] into the world that's why the bible says
[40:57] that
[40:58] adam was formed
[41:03] but it don't say that of jesus
[41:08] see jesus actually went through a birth
[41:14] he went through a birth
[41:17] see he was begotten amen
[41:21] adam was created brother around and said
[41:24] right from the hand of almighty god
[41:28] adam was created but jesus wasn't
[41:31] created like that
[41:33] he was begotten he just
[41:36] went from one existence to another to
[41:38] another existence
[41:39] and kept coming until he become human
[41:42] right
[41:43] and that took 4 000 years
[41:49] that took the prophets with the word and
[41:51] the thing
[41:53] to bring that to where that jesus could
[41:56] be the word made flesh
[41:59] the son of man all right
[42:04] so now you're following me
[42:07] phase one we're still in it that that
[42:09] was in phase one
[42:11] which was before the foundation of the
[42:12] world now is moving over closer
[42:15] into the coming into natural being
[42:20] so you take adam from genesis 1
[42:24] with eternal life in his soul
[42:29] you put a body then in genesis 2 put
[42:32] that genesis 1 into genesis 2.
[42:34] now you've got
[42:37] a human being
[42:42] but don't ever think that you've got a
[42:44] human being that can't fall
[42:47] now you can't fall and be lost
[42:50] we do not believe in that you can't have
[42:53] eternal life
[42:54] and lose it
[42:58] are you with me you can't have eternal
[43:00] life and lose it
[43:03] but you can't have eternal life and live
[43:05] like the devil
[43:10] they don't don't try to go that way and
[43:11] say well you know that that means that i
[43:14] i'm eternal and and i can't fall
[43:18] no i agree with you
[43:22] if you have eternal life today you can't
[43:24] fall from eternal life where would you
[43:26] fall to
[43:31] but if you have eternal life you don't
[43:32] want to fall
[43:36] why would you want to fall what would be
[43:38] your your thoughts
[43:39] why would you even have human thoughts
[43:41] in your mind to think
[43:43] well it don't matter what i do i'm a
[43:45] christian
[43:47] it doesn't matter what you do
[43:50] because you can prove what you are about
[43:53] what we do
[43:54] all right so right now we are with our
[43:57] phase one
[44:00] brings the eternal soul of an eternal
[44:02] being
[44:04] into existence
[44:07] and then genesis 2 you put that into the
[44:10] flesh
[44:13] and there's the flesh man adam now adam
[44:17] can go out with the animals and things
[44:19] and it'd be
[44:20] close but still it's not the natural
[44:23] atom
[44:25] that's going out there with the animals
[44:26] and controlling it
[44:28] right it's the spiritual atom that's in
[44:30] with inside
[44:33] adam then would be made a living soul
[44:38] a person with eternal life
[44:41] all right now you've got an ability
[44:44] though
[44:49] for the man to fall so now you're coming
[44:52] with your attributes
[44:54] are you with me now you've got your
[44:56] you're coming to the basis that you can
[44:58] have attributes come into being
[45:02] in other words god can come down and
[45:04] fellowship with the mankind
[45:07] but yet he can't fellowship no further
[45:09] than the fact of being
[45:11] knowing that he's a human being
[45:15] but he can be a savior he can be a
[45:17] healer he can be all of those things
[45:19] through the attributes that have been
[45:21] displayed
[45:22] not by adam
[45:27] no adam made the way that the things you
[45:31] know
[45:32] god to use adam to make the way for
[45:34] things to take place
[45:38] now you've got your attributes of mine
[45:41] now you've got a flesh man
[45:45] and then that odd to think about that
[45:47] you've got a flesh man
[45:49] the flesh man adam come before the flesh
[45:52] man jesus
[45:57] that's what i'm saying that's hard to
[45:59] express
[46:00] but you've got to have if you've got any
[46:02] sense at all you know it's the truth
[46:07] because you read your bible
[46:13] come on read your bible the first man
[46:17] adam was made a living soul
[46:22] eternal life within his soul
[46:28] the second adam is the lord of glory
[46:33] adam is not the second adam you don't do
[46:35] that you have the first adam and the
[46:37] basis of what
[46:38] he is to do but the second adam is the
[46:40] lord jesus christ
[46:47] but now you have the ability to fall
[46:53] well i never thought of it like that
[46:55] would you explain it to me then
[47:01] well i don't believe adam and eve had
[47:03] eternal life
[47:04] well they didn't anyhow know where to
[47:06] fall from
[47:08] see
[47:14] did you understand the point if adam and
[47:17] eve didn't have eternal life
[47:19] how could they fall you can't fall if
[47:21] you ain't got it
[47:25] you can't fall off a roof until you get
[47:27] up there
[47:31] and see you can't fall from eternal life
[47:33] to go to hell
[47:35] because god made the way because that's
[47:37] part of his attribute
[47:39] and he left out that attribute as savior
[47:41] then you would have the ability to fall
[47:43] and go to hell
[47:45] but he didn't he's got all of these
[47:46] attributes amen
[47:49] savior healer alfred amiga rosa sharon
[47:53] all of that you've got all of the things
[47:55] that he has the
[47:56] ability to display those things
[48:02] and it took him 4 000 years
[48:10] think about that
[48:13] from the time of adam in the garden and
[48:15] all until the birth of a baby named
[48:18] jesus christ
[48:25] but you see look at adam
[48:30] follow my point now eternal life and
[48:33] soul
[48:35] but not in body and spirit when the lord
[48:38] jesus christ stepped upon this earth
[48:41] he was in exactly the same condition
[48:45] he turned alive in his soul but his body
[48:48] and spirit was not eternal
[48:53] because now the displaying of the
[48:55] attributes come into being
[48:57] that he can die
[49:02] just as i said don't think you can't
[49:04] fall
[49:06] just think of the being the fall being
[49:08] in the right order you can't fall and
[49:09] lose eternal life no
[49:15] but you can be cut short
[49:22] but the lord jesus when he came
[49:26] he couldn't fall no way all right
[49:31] and see then when he was made a child
[49:35] think about it see we're up on stage two
[49:40] stage two and now is
[49:43] god to come into human flesh
[49:49] god coming into human flesh was not the
[49:52] uh
[49:52] how can i say this now come on by adam
[49:58] and eve coming the way they did in the
[50:00] fall that we've been through
[50:01] then you can see that there is a fallen
[50:03] condition that can exist
[50:05] i hope you understand that you can see
[50:09] that
[50:09] mankind did fall
[50:12] adam and eve fell but they didn't fall
[50:15] to death
[50:18] well i got where the prophet said he
[50:19] felt that adam fell from eternal life
[50:21] where did he fall to that's all i'm
[50:23] asking you i'm not arguing with you
[50:25] where did he fall to
[50:30] adam had the capability of falling
[50:33] physically
[50:35] and he did physically but he never died
[50:38] spiritually
[50:43] right see but when jesus came upon the
[50:47] earth
[50:49] he became the second adam
[50:52] to be able to take the place of the
[50:55] mankind
[50:57] that had fallen or to display his
[50:59] attributes
[51:01] now you're coming to phase two that
[51:03] we're trying to get see then
[51:05] adam listen jesus was begotten
[51:15] adam was not begotten adam was created
[51:21] he said it's all the same no no it ain't
[51:25] jesus is the only begotten son
[51:28] we're sons by by uh uh adoption
[51:32] and things
[51:37] so listen to what your prophet is saying
[51:40] first creation is a spiritual creation
[51:43] of god and adam as the spiritual birth
[51:48] the second part is the lord of glory
[51:53] that comes into being
[51:56] to where that he can be into that and
[51:59] and god can look down
[52:01] and see what's taking place
[52:08] adam was his first created son
[52:12] taken from the message uh god's powers
[52:15] are
[52:15] transformed jesus was his only begotten
[52:21] he was begotten by a woman
[52:24] but adam was right straight from the
[52:28] hand of god
[52:29] in the creation so adam was created
[52:34] he created a physical body back there
[52:36] and stuck adam in it
[52:38] adam the spiritual man was put into the
[52:41] natural
[52:42] the lord jesus was begotten
[52:48] see from a woman all right
[52:52] come on
[52:57] let's go ahead and read just a little
[52:58] bit go to number five brothers we'll
[53:01] just pick up a short cut cut some of it
[53:03] anyway
[53:06] you know that we've done been through it
[53:08] god gave himself birth to his the son
[53:10] which was before there was even an adam
[53:15] he started to make another creation now
[53:16] let's go to number five
[53:19] he comes from the future home holy ghost
[53:22] descended upon the earth jesus was the
[53:24] beginning
[53:25] of the creation of god oh you see it god
[53:28] made
[53:29] in creation he was spirit the bible said
[53:32] he is the beginning of the creation of
[53:34] god how did he begin
[53:37] in the wounds of a woman which is
[53:40] what the woman is and that's what i told
[53:43] you when i
[53:44] come through that i like that wounds
[53:49] natural wound but a spiritual wound
[53:53] eve had a natural wound for a natural
[53:55] child but she had a
[53:57] spiritual wound for the word of god
[54:01] so then you've got the wounds and the
[54:03] wounds of a woman
[54:05] like how them blind people can't see the
[54:07] serpent's seat
[54:09] right here the eve was put here on the
[54:12] earth
[54:13] and before satan ever touched her or
[54:16] anything else
[54:16] god said to them multiply and replenish
[54:19] the earth
[54:20] that's right but satan comes in here and
[54:23] if that was
[54:24] adam's son then word adam was a direct
[54:28] descendant from god
[54:30] and you can only take the nature of your
[54:32] parents
[54:33] and when you get born again you take the
[54:35] nature of your parents
[54:37] all right are you following me then what
[54:40] happens
[54:42] go to number six
[54:50] okay jesus christ is the beginning of
[54:52] the creation of god
[54:54] revelation 1 is that right then when
[54:57] when was god created he is the beginning
[55:00] of the creation of god
[55:02] and god is eternal is that right but
[55:04] when
[55:05] god was created now listen when a little
[55:09] baby
[55:09] that was conceived in the wound of a
[55:12] mother
[55:13] a virgin and she began to develop those
[55:15] cells within her
[55:17] to bring forth this little baby that was
[55:20] the beginning of god's creation
[55:25] right for god was made flesh and dwelt
[55:29] among us
[55:30] and become emmanuel god with us the
[55:32] beginning of the creation
[55:34] of god do you understand
[55:38] when he came into being
[55:42] it was through the wound of a woman
[55:46] now follow back
[55:50] adam was created
[55:55] are you with me god created adam
[56:01] god formed jesus
[56:06] through the birth the birth had to bring
[56:10] forth why
[56:11] because he's going to have to display
[56:12] his attributes
[56:14] you can't display the attributes without
[56:16] it being
[56:18] him being god himself in human flesh
[56:22] god adam was his son
[56:27] a created son creative son
[56:32] but jesus was his only was his begotten
[56:35] son
[56:37] and god was in jesus reconciling the
[56:40] world unto himself
[56:42] are you with me now
[56:46] adam was created let us make man
[56:50] he made him but jesus wasn't formed he
[56:53] was birthed
[56:56] mary gave birth to the lord jesus christ
[56:59] why because that would bring forth all
[57:01] your attributes
[57:03] now you've got everything in order when
[57:07] that baby was on this earth
[57:08] he was emmanuel right
[57:12] yet he couldn't die for your sins
[57:16] he was 10 years old he couldn't die for
[57:18] your sins
[57:20] when he was over there with discussing
[57:22] the bible with the pharisees and
[57:24] he couldn't die for your sins when he
[57:26] become 30 years of becoming 30 he had
[57:29] to reach to that point
[57:33] that he could be a creative be a savior
[57:37] see now you've got the creator back in
[57:39] the way he's wanted
[57:40] to be as begotten the only begotten of
[57:45] the father
[57:47] he was the only one that had begotten
[57:48] that way now the rest of us has begotten
[57:51] that away
[57:52] he was begotten that away
[57:56] that was his way of coming you know i
[57:57] didn't cut it we come by natural mom and
[57:59] daddy
[58:03] right you say well you just said
[58:07] that they should come forth in the wound
[58:08] of a mother yeah but that was
[58:11] without sex
[58:16] right that was without sin
[58:19] see don't put him as a sinner now
[58:22] leave him to be what he's supposed to be
[58:24] a creator a savior all of those things
[58:26] yeah
[58:27] but don't make him a sinner see
[58:31] god come forth into human flesh
[58:36] to become our savior
[58:40] and as he did adam
[58:46] could not die for my sins
[58:53] there's no way adam could die for your
[58:54] sins it wouldn't work out
[58:57] but the great creator
[59:02] could die but it would take him then 30
[59:05] something years after coming into the
[59:07] world
[59:09] becoming 30 the bible says
[59:13] that's why you can figure out the three
[59:15] and a half and the different things and
[59:16] it'll come out to be perfectly right
[59:18] because jesus was becoming 30.
[59:23] not to be 30 to be a minister you had to
[59:26] be becoming 30
[59:28] in other words on your way he was 29 and
[59:30] a half and that makes it the worst
[59:32] jesus could preach three and a half
[59:33] years and then preach three and a half
[59:35] years
[59:35] and it come out now the ministry and be
[59:37] in the correct correct order
[59:39] just put in a little point
[59:43] but are you following me
[59:47] so he was that
[59:50] second stage of creation
[59:55] was the bringing into order
[59:59] first the man adam
[1:00:02] put it with the ability to sin
[1:00:05] put him in a condition that he could
[1:00:10] sin do wrong
[1:00:14] but yet he would never be lost
[1:00:17] god didn't curse adam god didn't curse
[1:00:21] eve
[1:00:22] god cursed the ground he couldn't he
[1:00:24] couldn't he cursed that beast and that
[1:00:26] but he didn't curse the human race
[1:00:29] that's where we're wrong thinking we did
[1:00:31] no but when that baby come into the
[1:00:35] world there come your savior
[1:00:38] there was god in human flesh
[1:00:44] adam was not god in human flesh adam was
[1:00:48] adam
[1:00:48] in human flesh a son of god
[1:00:52] a child of god but jesus was god
[1:00:55] almighty
[1:00:56] in human flesh
[1:01:01] right the only begotten
[1:01:07] the only begotten what about it
[1:01:14] he started a new race
[1:01:18] you've got the easy of supposed to read
[1:01:20] them
[1:01:23] he started a new race in in adam
[1:01:28] because he brought forth a natural
[1:01:30] person a new race
[1:01:32] new creation new race
[1:01:36] but all that got wiped out in the
[1:01:38] ability to portray it or do it
[1:01:40] by the fall and the conditions and was
[1:01:42] all made to be right
[1:01:44] but here comes jesus christ
[1:01:47] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:01:51] god steps down into human flesh
[1:01:54] through the wound of a woman to be able
[1:01:58] to take away the sin
[1:02:00] of mankind to be able to display his
[1:02:03] attributes and make man
[1:02:04] make it come forth into the correct
[1:02:06] order and he started a new race
[1:02:13] now jesus started a new race adam just
[1:02:16] started
[1:02:18] race
[1:02:20] jesus started a new race
[1:02:24] a new creation a creation of himself
[1:02:30] as the way he wanted it right
[1:02:33] as before the world ever begun that he
[1:02:35] wanted it
[1:02:38] now he's not lonely anymore because now
[1:02:41] he's coming to the poor
[1:02:42] to where he can really display
[1:02:46] what he has need of so do you understand
[1:02:49] phase one and phase two maybe that
[1:02:52] maybe it's not enough i'll i'll pray and
[1:02:54] see if we'll go back over and i'll go
[1:02:55] back over because i don't don't bother
[1:02:57] me
[1:02:58] you know i just keep preaching until i
[1:03:02] get satisfied
[1:03:04] or either confuse you enough to make you
[1:03:06] where you'll study
[1:03:08] because that's one point but listen
[1:03:12] a new creation
[1:03:17] you can't depend upon adam
[1:03:20] even though he had eternal life and soul
[1:03:24] even though he was a child of god in the
[1:03:28] physical points of of
[1:03:30] being you know uh different than uh the
[1:03:33] rest of the people around
[1:03:36] right you agree with that i mean he he
[1:03:39] was a a child of god yeah and he was
[1:03:41] but he wasn't physically made any
[1:03:43] different but yet he was
[1:03:45] in the bases that god could deal with
[1:03:49] adam
[1:03:53] right god can deal with you by the new
[1:03:57] birth
[1:03:58] that's right all right
[1:04:02] see but to come forth in a new creation
[1:04:08] now naturally speaking adam was the
[1:04:11] beginning of a
[1:04:13] group of people but spiritually speaking
[1:04:16] jesus christ was the beginning of the
[1:04:18] creation of god
[1:04:19] god coming down into human flesh
[1:04:22] all right now but that don't end the
[1:04:25] story
[1:04:28] i don't know how to approach this part
[1:04:30] right here so i'll do the best i can
[1:04:32] it's part of the story that we're not
[1:04:38] understanding
[1:04:40] not understanding childhood
[1:04:45] we're not understanding how we are the
[1:04:46] children of god
[1:04:48] now that we're the offspring of almighty
[1:04:50] god
[1:04:53] by imparting eternal life into your soul
[1:04:57] he has made you now listen
[1:05:00] he has made you back like adam
[1:05:04] was before the fall
[1:05:08] he has given you eternal life in your
[1:05:10] soul
[1:05:13] you can never lose that you have eternal
[1:05:17] life
[1:05:20] huh
[1:05:23] but that's not all of the race see
[1:05:27] now adam was doing fine
[1:05:30] but it's not said of adam that he was a
[1:05:32] new creation a new race
[1:05:35] we know it was because god chose it to
[1:05:39] be that way
[1:05:41] but what about a church what about a
[1:05:44] group of people
[1:05:45] okay go to number 13 let's read this and
[1:05:48] then we'll quit
[1:05:49] i want to read this whole thing the
[1:05:52] number 13 if you will
[1:05:59] you'll see that i jumped around a lot on
[1:06:00] this and you understand i jumped around
[1:06:05] and listened to what your prophet had to
[1:06:07] say
[1:06:09] from the ladies in church age of church
[1:06:11] age book
[1:06:13] but now he's standing in the midst of
[1:06:15] the church
[1:06:18] as he stands there revealing who he
[1:06:21] is in this last age he calls himself
[1:06:27] the author of the creation of god
[1:06:31] this is another creation
[1:06:34] now watch this has to do with the church
[1:06:43] this is a special designation of himself
[1:06:50] now this is himself coming into being
[1:06:51] the way he wanted it i want to put that
[1:06:53] right there
[1:06:55] what i'm reading this about is to get
[1:06:57] you to see god
[1:06:59] wanted his what how did brother uh
[1:07:02] right around and said god had his church
[1:07:04] the way he
[1:07:05] started the church the way he started it
[1:07:07] and he wanted it the way
[1:07:09] he finished who who's the statement my
[1:07:11] brother uh henry greene was the one that
[1:07:14] made it
[1:07:17] that god started his church the way he
[1:07:19] wanted it and he wanted that church back
[1:07:20] again
[1:07:22] that's the point i can't get the exact
[1:07:24] wording but listen
[1:07:26] he says this is a special designation of
[1:07:28] himself
[1:07:31] who is he
[1:07:34] he is the creator of that church the
[1:07:37] heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:07:39] bride
[1:07:40] as the spirit of god he came down in the
[1:07:42] virgin mary
[1:07:44] the cells come down and created in the
[1:07:46] virgin mary the cells from which his
[1:07:48] body was born
[1:07:50] i want to repeat that he created the
[1:07:52] very sales
[1:07:54] in the wound of mary for that body
[1:07:57] now remember how that we were in the
[1:07:59] message last
[1:08:01] week that
[1:08:04] that jesus christ
[1:08:07] that body
[1:08:11] it's how do you say it
[1:08:16] the the body of almighty god
[1:08:20] was not something that he took material
[1:08:23] and
[1:08:23] put it together now i'm trying to get a
[1:08:27] point across so listen
[1:08:29] it was spoken into existence
[1:08:33] it was not something that he built it up
[1:08:36] and see he didn't do that with
[1:08:37] with uh you know a natural baby
[1:08:41] but he spoke it into existence now
[1:08:44] that's what i'm trying to get you to see
[1:08:45] here
[1:08:46] the bride of jesus christ is the very
[1:08:50] word of god
[1:08:54] spoken into existence
[1:08:58] okay so now listen
[1:09:01] it was not enough for the holy spirit to
[1:09:04] simply give life to a human
[1:09:06] over him supplied by mary that would
[1:09:09] have been
[1:09:09] sinful mankind produced in a body that
[1:09:12] would not have produced the last adam
[1:09:15] of whom it was said lower body thou hast
[1:09:17] thou father
[1:09:18] prepared for me god not mary provided
[1:09:22] that body
[1:09:23] mary was the human incubator and she
[1:09:26] carried that holy child and brought him
[1:09:28] to birth
[1:09:29] it was a it was a god man
[1:09:33] he was the son of god he was of the new
[1:09:35] creation
[1:09:36] man and god met and joined together he
[1:09:40] was the first of this new race
[1:09:42] he's the head of this new race who's he
[1:09:45] talking about the lord jesus christ all
[1:09:48] right
[1:09:48] and it comes forth there you see that
[1:09:51] though man was
[1:09:52] of the old order or creation now
[1:09:55] in union with christ he has become the
[1:09:58] new creation of god
[1:10:02] now he's become the new creation
[1:10:08] okay no longer is he dealing by ways of
[1:10:11] the flesh
[1:10:13] that was how he dealt with israel he
[1:10:16] chose abraham and abraham's issue
[1:10:18] through the
[1:10:18] godly isaac line but now out of every
[1:10:21] kindred tribe and nation he has
[1:10:24] purposed a new creation he's the first
[1:10:27] of that creation
[1:10:29] he was god created in the form of man
[1:10:34] now by his spirit he is creating many
[1:10:36] sons unto himself
[1:10:38] god the creator created himself a part
[1:10:40] of his creation
[1:10:41] this is the true revelation of god
[1:10:46] the true revelation of god is god and
[1:10:47] man becoming one
[1:10:52] god and man becoming one is the real
[1:10:55] true
[1:10:57] revelation of almighty god and he chose
[1:11:00] you
[1:11:04] he chose you to be his child
[1:11:10] he chose you to tell you this mystery of
[1:11:13] redemption
[1:11:15] he chose us to be that new creation you
[1:11:19] race
[1:11:21] new creation no longer dealing by the
[1:11:25] old ways
[1:11:27] don't deal by the new way which is the
[1:11:28] new man the christ jesus
[1:11:34] so then adam was created yeah
[1:11:38] but jesus was begotten
[1:11:41] now if he's the only begotten of the
[1:11:44] father who are we
[1:11:50] we are his offspring
[1:11:56] we're his children we're sons and
[1:11:59] daughters of a living god
[1:12:02] by the new birth that he has given to us
[1:12:04] eternal life
[1:12:07] making us part of that new race
[1:12:12] you realize what he's done for you and
[1:12:13] me
[1:12:16] stage one sure we'll get back to it
[1:12:21] if you wouldn't back there you never
[1:12:23] will be backed up
[1:12:27] stage two brings a physical man
[1:12:33] adam in the garden stage 3
[1:12:37] brings it back the way god wanted it
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:42] he wanted that whole creation before the
[1:12:44] foundation of the world
[1:12:47] to be part and he's making you and me to
[1:12:50] be part of that new creation
[1:12:52] that new race
[1:12:55] his offspring
[1:13:00] if he was the only begotten then we're
[1:13:03] begotten through him
[1:13:06] right we're begotten through jesus
[1:13:09] christ
[1:13:12] eternal life given into your soul
[1:13:14] waiting the redemption of the body i
[1:13:18] told my brother russ here today about it
[1:13:19] i said
[1:13:20] thing that i'm looking at right now is
[1:13:22] the change of the body
[1:13:26] the change of the body
[1:13:29] why because everything else is in order
[1:13:33] what i was talking about was the natural
[1:13:35] part that we were talking about
[1:13:37] that we now have
[1:13:42] the white house with the woman
[1:13:45] it's full of catholics so it can be
[1:13:46] either way that you want to use it as
[1:13:48] the
[1:13:49] natural church or if you want to use it
[1:13:50] as a natural woman
[1:13:52] as vice president you have that in order
[1:13:55] right now and there's no telling what's
[1:14:00] going to happen
[1:14:04] just like i told brother russ i said
[1:14:05] i've never been a doomsday
[1:14:07] i've never been down
[1:14:12] hmm
[1:14:15] this is the greatest hour there could
[1:14:18] ever be
[1:14:20] to thank that god made a new creation
[1:14:23] a new race and you are that new creation
[1:14:30] you are his offspring you're his
[1:14:33] children
[1:14:37] sons and daughters of a living god is
[1:14:40] god made manifest
[1:14:41] in another form called the bride

[1:14:48] in the church
[1:14:49] book of himself this has to do with the
[1:14:54] church
[1:14:57] the church is his bride
[1:15:04] you ever thought about a bride being
[1:15:05] more important than the children

[1:15:12] little bit
[1:15:17] a bride cause you know what a bride is

[1:15:35] give your heart and soul to almighty god
