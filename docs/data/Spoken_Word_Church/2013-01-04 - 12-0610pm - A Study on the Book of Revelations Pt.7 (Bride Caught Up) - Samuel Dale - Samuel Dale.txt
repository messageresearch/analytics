the second thing let me get let me get through this then we finish our date Randy class and I'm going to call your name I want you to stand Boinga then it actually in Jonathan left okay aiming Jeffries on here just the way I know how K&E definitely shop for those you hear it Joseph Rachel Richard nana and out and sit to Rebecca out of these people plus Ma Jun 55 others from Keller wait for from keller williams and brother Joseph sister Debra out of these people you see standing up in 13 weeks they paid off ninety six thousand dollars in a savings thirty-nine thousand four hundred fifty dollars and the dead that was aborted is 380 2360 wanting to work at some of these people it works you can be seated now we're starting a new class we're not going to start on July the 15th this year because I talked to one of the representatives that the university there and they got all brand-new material totally different this the one we went through was 13 weeks now they say that much money in 13 weeks we took them out when we started we took them out 13 weeks later that's how much they saved in 13 weeks then money that they paid off in debt and you say how much why is that so much for debt avoided we'll see like june and i refinanced our loan at a 3.75 percent interest rate for 15 years so we reduced our years plus we reduce your interest rate so we saved 40 thousand dollars in interest that was dead avoided had we not put the class with a state where we're at all right sins and things like that we avoided other things but we can get into that when we do the class but the class will now start all this to fifth for those of you that are going sister Regina sister milka grubbing rude Bobby Monica aaron and sarah joyce and danny anderson and now sister Barbara Jacob fountain Timbo being a brand-new rich in charlotte treaty two sons already signed up feel free to sign up if you want to it will pay yourself on your web on this guy's went guns all over it back here and then Boyd and Dan had said I think they're there they're kind of running neck and neck and he's trying to save the most money but but it works but with that makes 13 couples are 20 people but we're going to start off as the fifth because it's all new material everything's brand-new actually we will probably one of the first classes with the new material all right so we wanted to do it on july but we need to wait till August the fifth to get all the material here and it will run from august the fifth to sep tember the 30th or if you want to take off labor day week and we will take off labor day weekend if you're going out of town because it's you know ask the other guys it's it's it's critical that you're there at everyone and it's critical that you're there each consecutive week because it's just like that you know it's late for something you if you can do it at home as you want to but you know it's kind of like you said if you were going to Weight Watchers if you didn't have to go over tuesday and get up on those scales in front of all these people you feeling laughs but if you know you've got to do it on tues then you got to get up on those gals in front of those people then you'll you'll you know your attitude toward it will be a little bit stronger but I'm going to put this back up downstairs to sign-up sheet so if anybody else wants to do it fine with me Jim and I love to do it and honest-to-goodness always hope make a living we don't make nothing doing this we do this other goodness there are hard but it'll start from five to seven after the service is over here at 4-430 whatever and go goodbye David whatever will make sandwiches here something we will get an oil for ourselves if you want to make your own sandwiches here that's fine but we'll start at five will be four five to seven AO smith a shortened it to an hour and a half so if they shorten it to an hour and a half the next much better kick but it's nine weeks nine forces and it will be fine for those of you that have already took it you know you ask any questions about a new material from the old members is the key is forty nine dollars but when I talked to the representative he said all you need if you want to come to the class is a new workbook which is fifteen dollars so those users took the class and want to come into this class but remember I want to stretch this some of you that's taking this class please watch some of the children for these people that are going to take the class because you've been through it somebody's watched your kid come and watch somebody's children while they can take the class for those of you that are gonna take the classroom for maybe some of you others that are not going to take the class that's the too stubborn to change we will allow you to watch their kids for a little while but the class will be started all this the fifth and we'll do downstairs on my son's to class but we should have the TV up by the end of TV stream the 42 inch screen so we'll show the videos on that and we will continue on with that for those of you that said this morning talking about how they breath around we had all the answers I just wanted to look up Thursday understanding working home I looked up brother Graham talk about money 1,900 pounds answer me 1994 to do with even investments if you'll reinvestment sure he's making a natural point about it or a spiritual point but he brings a natural point look up some of those quotes that will bring and there's 800 scriptures in the Bible that talks about money the Bible tells us to be a good steward brother Ram talks about man good steward of your money okay if you're not a good steward of your money you definitely not gonna be a good steward of Dodge money and you I'm getting real bad trouble if you're a bastard right it's all God's anyway you just let him have ten percent back he live off the 10 percent better than you run to live on for 90 right you do one to ten and we need to do with 90 but it's all his and what we deal with it no we're going to give an account for it i'll read you some quotes home and go downstairs in the class a bouncer grocery photographs that you will be held responsible for what you do with your money just to saying brother Dale's gonna be responsible for the money that comes into this church cars going to hold you responsible don't think we're going to get my old thing where I'm going to get back and it's Christians we shouldn't want to get by we shouldn't want to get my wish it low and try to weasel on her way out of something there's no way you don't get out you think you you think IRS is not looking but I do look at that you guys if he's looking he's going to require of you after the hour s is already gone I know the deal with them going to deal with him right so listen that was that that's just someone you to bring chase the blessing some blessing to do this June and I really enjoyed which everybody would do it but it takes a change it

able to see him compute going to see everybody in the house of the Lord be looking out there was in the back while ago I said a couple of holes in the back did everybody go home and everybody good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you like turning your Scripture earn woman reading in Revelations one and now remember i forgot to announce that this morning most of you know when brother Donnie Moore that goes up to brother Richard Wilson he had a for bypass heart open surgery or what she called it more bypass he had one that was blocked 201 to buck the 90s to unblock 60 and you know so he he had that and he's come to it real fine we just pray for Cody's gonna need prayer and then we pay you know from the people so remember that remember brother Gibby's preaching lord willing i'm preaching down it brother a sister day so remember that and i'm sure my wife wants to thank all of you for all of the gifts and cards and the notes and the things and to thank you and we certainly want to thank you for all of the food and it was wonderful if i get the Birkin you know if you work will call a burp a name NSS I forget to Berkman I said man you in the spirit now no look night after night I just remember to pray one parameters got all the announcements anymore that we have I don't think so okay to week we did with the Dave Ramsey class we did pay for all of the ones from the church her that went and we will pay for this time coming around for everybody that wants to go to that and you say well why would you want to pay for them to do that well if you can save as much money as it's been saved some of you move debts around and got some finances better we are going to be facing some tough times and i really suggest you get your finances don't worry because you know it may be in some type things coming up and i will just do that argument let's let's pray before we read your scripture father we thank you we love you we ask you Lord to just help each and every one of us and guide each one of us and not understanding more than editor let your love be with us forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and just keep us Lord come and speak to us this after those by your spirit and dark our hearts that we may speak to your people but we truly believe faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word goddess now forgive our sins because that's what we wonder stand completing you we don't want nothing to be a hindrance whatsoever between us Lord we love you we thank you in Jesus name we've been reading this we read this scripture ever services coaching it's the whole point right the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show it to his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who buy a record of the word of God and of the test Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw this it is he that readeth and they they hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written our end for the time is at hand ever you may be seated where that is blessing the reading of the word now we're trying to cover some things no I hope that helps you because to you know get a good understanding got some comments about the mornings message and you know I'm just trying my best to get us to a place that we can be anchored in the word not carried about by every wind of doctrine an idea but just stand on it and you know it's been quite a controversial thing over the people of the message of this x brother round has said and you know but if we just wait I know one person said like from the Feast of the trumpets they put a round of mates with me slips of the tongue it couldn't be understood that he said it was dust at the boy well you know I don't think he might slips of the tongue I think what he does is he spoke by revelation when you speak by revelation it's going to automatically wind up you know looking odd because as I said this morning about that scripture where it said jesus said I am the door of the Sheep he didn't say I'm the door the chief oh that's fine that's over another stretcher you know that he is that door but Mara was you too John chem 7 I think that you know I am the door of the sheep and see that's what i wanted to me i want you to be my whole goal my revelation my desire my thoughts and everything is to be based upon him and that's what we're trying to do is get that understanding to us of the word of God but its revelation of Jesus Christ the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus cravat but he then we found that we were in a day and time maybe of thinking about a revelation of Jesus Christ even actually come into message and that was right to try to understand about Jesus himself and that was good but then we come to find out that all of the time he's been trying to get us to see where he's at and I've always said it that way I said you know we've said spent six thousand years time to prove there's a God up in heaven and God has spent six thousand years found the privity down here with us look like we'd get that right eventually and I'll be able to move on with a whole thing but they would always try to figure it happen when we try to figure it out then we will miss it by trying to interpret it that's right now and that's that's where we try to wait I've seen things and had things in my heart and sometimes keep them as much as 20 to 30 years before it ever get to preach other because if I can't see it by revelation then what's in the needle me just making an intellectual speech you know I've giving you the quotes and the things and also when you hear me preach you you know for sure that there is something that I'm trying to get across before I spoke to me about and it may take it may not be in one message you might take 10 to get off one thought you know the people and get it covered up alright so now what I want us to do is go back to quote number eight on the mornings message and and review that just a little bit and you know try to get to a point to see something that we covered this more in it on and been covering how that John was a type of the rapture well now as I've tried to bring out this morning to you that John was typing at without within 2,000 years almost from that time and the rapture itself has a transpired yet but John spoke of it back there and what's happening now is exactly what he spoke out there you know and was given unto him to bring up to us and all but it doesn't mean see if it will but people say well the Lord came in 63 and you know and they say well Mary what I prove it to you see look at I said the Prophet went out of Arizona and he met the angels of the Lord to come back to the seals inside the other and so the Lord came in 63 what you know that was only program right because if he didn't speak it and what you did catch it while he was preaching on the seals and things you know some people caught it but most of the basis of people didn't catch it no and so then it it's something that I've tried to get you to say look at the Bible asst is speaking to you and I all right it's revealing Christ but it's Christ the mystery of God reveal a they paid said before that the Prophet said the brightest part of the mystery and must be revealed well then if you just went through the Book of Revelations and speaking only of Jesus then where would you be like I told you you won't see him in Revelations myself he's in bright for because why because under their Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came he's been in bright for me recently and that was the form of God that is the form of God all right we'll get to it maybe wednesday on some pains but run around said he come down to the church age is a son of god was that didn't write in the end time he'll come forward to the son of man well he's got to do that before he can go to the Millennium to fulfill the scriptures you know and fulfill what we'll get to Wednesday you know about the throne of God come on but now we were trying to get that point across this morning that I believe it's a day and a time to understand as we read it dirt spoke of learning revelation 13 this is the time to understand this is the time now to do what this is the time to be caught up rapture word rats remember profit that's not even in the Bible says the word caught up right all right this is the time for us to be caught up in the revelation of what the profit is brought to us all right now there she ratchet man see because the little ate them all in the blink of an eye is what we talked about rats you know gone off the earth but if we're not caught up into the revelation and prepared for the moment then we're not going to be in that group that will be changing them all to take the life we may have to go by the grave then I've said that 40 years ago that's the biggest portion of people in the end time would have to go by the grade because we would not be I said we would not be able to have the time to change us the more quickly and that's fine with me if I have to go that way it's not degrading nobody right but it's the truth somebody's going to have to stand there that can look Beth right in the face and say get out of here you know how no part to do a lesson yeah just go on huh you said well we will never do that well the Prophet said we would so I believe it and why can't we believe it we're part of it you know I mean if it can be done I want to be part of what's being done all right but now John being caught up he is the type of the bride but then we were covering how that John had an experience now hi I see I'm trying to think of how it was preached years ago and forget I mean miss it a little bit think about it that John never saw his own experience I'm sure he's in the part of the body of Christ and I don't understand but John didn't necessarily see his own experience he did because I said that he was in the body part of honor but what he saw was the experience that you and I are going down because if he saw his experience now listen and that's all he saw then he was in the grave better you're saying right did you say well John saw his experience well he's in the grave then but he saw somebody that haven't experienced that is going to have an experience upon this earth to be able to be changed all right so then he would be on the speaking of what is here in the end time the orsay wouldn't say about that that he he had his own experience but with his experience he's in the grey somebody go out to how the experience of not going by the credit all right why can't we believe we're part of it you know I mean somebody's gotta be it why not no one on us and just me into that point all right now so let's see if we can be caught up in the red elation you know how our walk each day in the life that we're living but now let's go back to where we were this morning ending it up by covering it and then we're going to recover this afternoon about the relations for 219 and see what's going on so let's just go back and start with a little bit at the top now made it laughter he showed the end of the age of his work here he went on up into heaven now let's do you just feel going up see then I'll show you what's going to be after this after the church in he said John I can't tell you down here in the Lord I never remember when we got down to paul the paul couldn't tell it it was the time it wasn't time to tell what pawnshop all right man do you think he's not going to tell us you know right i mean some word he's going to to come forth and speak about it well maybe we'll be down to the eternities you know and receiving dark but not look but i can't tell you that here in a more cuz I left down here I'm come on higher come up here with me I'll show you what's going to take place you're at home on Oh caught up in Division caught up in the glory his experience now his experience is to see these things like halls experience to see these done but remember Paul and John with the experience they had or in the grave sure now waiting on somebody to have an experience then we'll bring them out all right now thank own though sciency his experience must have been something like that at all take the bridges 12 to 24 if you're putting it down second Corinthians 24 always gone up one day into a vision did you know that he saw things that wasn't expedient for him to even talk about 14 years never even mentioned it see but listen that the difference between them now the difference between John oh all good right is the John you're going to see good right here also he was forbidden to speak off yet hard to put it out to the public oh my I don't believe he could do it for our little trip I took one day I never got over it and never will key and he eats all things that he couldn't talk about I guess he didn't have words to he was caught up in the third Halen's go see up into the third heaven now different when how different when John was caught up and seen Jesus and John couldn't explicit I mean Jesus Paul good eats bread jon is going to expression all right and not a that he's gonna ride it down but remember what I said that when he wrote it down he wrote symbols that's it you put it in symbolic all right see meaning the N would have to be over here how different when John was caught up and sing jesus he was sitting right in a book what you up scene and get it back send it back to the churches always forbidden to speak and join work even asked to put it in a book so it would go all down through the ages oh my it's really turn out to be revealed in this life stays it wasn't revealed in his days it's revealed now as we go along by jon is told to write it down but it was told to put it in simple see knowing then that in the end time the Prophet would come that's right to show it and that's what I something like this morning you enjoying his over the revelations 10-7 and riding he's knowing that all of these things has got to go back to the church but he's wondering how in the world he hit at ipac that's it amen now you can get it back to the church but then it strikes you but the seventh angel is going to be a prophet so then that's the point that we're drilling on but not think about what I'm saying John writes about the church he rats about the church he writes what's going to take place read those Church Ages when you get talent when specially to the overcomer you watch this coming Wednesday night when we get to it because the look at the Lady of seeing overcoming right sit with me and my throne is out what we're coming set my father needs strong that's right they did will begin to pick up a little bit and understand some things about what's going on all right now but think about it all good right john told to ride it send it to the church in you believe it in symbol waiting for the end time to be able to understand so in John sees in Revelation 41 a door open in heaven he hadn't see a door you idiot but he used Jesus he heard a voice and knew it was the voice of Jesus in heaven all of those things getting him ready to come to that point now let's go to number nine because I want you to I want you to think about this segment it doesn't have a weird statement this is taken from our guy a guide 1962 in Fort any evening service good progress selling and now the next time don't you to read it when you read it now the next time before it i know it's nineteen sixty too much fart another thing you will be after the church is completed I retired show brother and my 62 he he was gone and wouldn't coming back no the church is completed are we completed we said oh we're not completed well then she brought around says a lot of things and you know what a lot of it is still in symbols right really quote I hate this quote I throw it in the trash pull it back out so i'll put it back in I didn't see the wall we go why put it back in I said well I'll put it back in and now the next time is far as I know to be with you will be asked to the church is completed now he's probably talking about the building because they were working on the building all right now but think about what he's saying and I walk to the end after the church ages there are we want to go into the selling my seals now he's telling you what he's done he waiting for them to complete the building run in he's done priests on the church ages so can you see what John done John wrote the church ages but never live to see him fulfill right right does that change anything let make any difference because John is not alive today I'm never know it makes his ride John writes to the church ages cinema and sends it to the church Amy then he goes on and he sees the seals the funny exactly what brother branham was doing he finished the church edges and then the seals broke to the prophet and he preached it me I asked her the church is completed I'm gonna come back and it was know that you know I started having services and then they had the seagulls honey we get the point John sees these things and rocks them and sims them to the churches that it's not even come into being yet i right 8090 50 wouldn't be in with the first church in Berkshire change started 1853 about 10 150 80-63 151 we get he's sending them to the church brother rather set it to the church Amen all right what's up to God and reveal it to John is actually writing about the things that would take place in the church Agius and sending them to the church ages before the ages even started other than the first one you see that then what would we argue and fuss or think about you know what I was talking about this morning on revelations 10-7 and thinking move run around got to be over there when he says the bride's not open see why would we think that what up they get like John John what are you gonna do them all right this thing now they've been cold him a legend that would you put in our language to that I've been going right now and matter to have to the summer at Burghley no on it and before they even started he's telling them what's going to be at his age is that a problem you through the problem for run around to stand here and tell us all the way to the change of the body and email to die and go how the grave and waiting on you and I did you trouble so we got to have it all then chronologically laid out I'm trying to keep our thinking on well if you're studying right you'll see it as identically chronologically correct John is writing to the age for the age ever starts right tell them to the bat of it but tell another do it right there little lady of see ya now it would be an angel messenger they would understand it would be completed I after the church is completed he had wait on something did brother round make the statement like this he said I've got just another step back everybody used the word and fall back he said wait on this to catch up over here he said no nothing sinful you know for the ride you were gonna go out and it yo mama here besides that I guess people was thinking courtly going but he said I can't progress any further he's I'm glad to wait until this catches up over here but I think we've had 40 years 40 something now for the world to catch up and I think we were to be able to look around system caught up pretty good you know in what's taking place another day in the hour that we're living and it's time to understand but now what I want us to deal with this afternoon will be the point of seeing revelations for through 19 and the bride's not here but you know what I love about it you know that it shows us you know that John was shown back guard that the lady of seeing age would take a rapture John was shown that contrary to the religious society that the bride would not have to go through the tribulation see you may only take that as a quote but to me it's an actual lay in order of scriptures money it's a great meaning that the bride don't have to go through the tribulation relationally the wrath of God poured out upon the earth is not these plays this is the amateur tribulation that's happening now that you see in people die Michael always emphasized you find the book of Revelation it tells you about a drastic thing happening in like seven thousand million doc let's that's drastic but what about a well let you to show me and I need say those murdered you 200,000 yep you think we're not near town look around right and no one let us know you were in the antenna but that's one thing I like about it so let's just cover that this is a minute what's your profit had to say maybe you've never thought about why would it be that we would you would emphasize that we're going to miss the tribulation do you realize that under Catholicism everybody goes to hell right my last hope it dies he went to hell now that's for dr. Joe Ghana Hades whatever words in one of you but you know they found out that that Iceland he done so good and he only has a whistle-stop know you don't want to use that he'll far and threaten you with it and then you got to pay you people out of perfect ovaries you know so many things they'll mouse up to so many so many Pence's mess up to so many days off so many good deeds gets you so many days off to everybody here they were down they got to the Catholic Church where to get a free trip to heaven weldon we're the day when like Steven Wilson said nobody goes to hell so they will have to do away with it I guess because everybody's preached into him well you don't want to appreciate ahem anoche because who's giving the money to the preacher preaches under heaven you said what do you do brother daily I had my brother nawl passed away just recently I'm not understanding so it's time to like you did you've ever said to me well she preaches Kimmel I preach to the congregation sitting in front of the window mentioning good i don't know where he was nailing but they're hailing racing tomatoes but he's done a good job raising delayed of the murder maybe they had him up garden have a job already Florida now would you see that's where they get your money from now what would it do how it applies brother Colley if all the preacher got it and preach all the people that roll down in the casket reach them in the hail I think you have a new church in a hurry would does everybody see if still got that same way one form or another and there's a threatening form to it if you leave us you doing this till you find that the message you out right right you find that where the preachers miss Mason said you leave this church you're going to you're in trouble now let them say that we know that's that same old funny that's Purgatory's and play in them you get out you know if you know a married they got much money you don't know not too good jerks miss messy you might accept you a little bit but you're very rich you're a deep inner preacher come on what i tell it like it eating rice you no i mean you got you got some advantages if you got a good billfold go that's pretty tourist season there by then the religious society held over mankind then we're going to a Tribulation Period doing run around again to preach it what the bride will not go through the tribulation I'm sure he was not well accepted upon that point don't you because it been talking people ever since it's born and all you know we're gonna all go through the tribulation what's the difference in saying we all got a goat relations are saying we all gotta go to hurt her to her right sure you know what's the difference just give a word all turned out to be the same problems it's a wrath of God perching us run around when they kept emphasizing he said now you mean if you married a wife it if you're going to put her through before you marry are you going to put her through tests and trials and and torment to say she don't stand it man said one time and the total further on it but he had his wife living out in the house that my country with no running water no nothing he said my wife stood the test I'm a mover in the time get her some running water I have to admit I wanted to give him some running water come on I didn't like it right all of that deal is I didn't care for it all right but listen church well would the Prophet would emphasize you know why would you think that you have to go through person of persecution in the tribulation to purge you it means you don't believe that the blood of jesus christ is sufficient and I make caramels I said sit done it enough it means you don't think the blood of jesus christ is sufficient yep so you're going to need a purging so you don't go through the tribulation there for a virgin I probably said we don't do that hey man now that meant a lot to him it certainly means a lot to many a man to think about that somebody can believe God enough to where there's not any purging to have to be done with that in mind now let's just read a couple of quotes of profit head-on then we'll get over it and you'll see these will all just stop right together now the bride will go up and that's the reason she goes up to look at number 10 see the reason she goes up it's a real reason money this is nothing 62 60 to take inside with Jesus Mary 55 56 57 which we realize in Revelation it's just one two three chapters to the church the church goes up in the fourth chapter it does not return any more to a 90 chap in order don't come back to earth you remember this morning we said we would be showing that runner Adam would say the drive goes and not seen the lower something I got the revelation 19 not see no more on earth she's going up in the rapture all right no he does not return again turn in war to a 19 chapter that's hike through the tribulation beauty when God called out the Jews he's in the tribulation that God calls the Jews out right right now that's right do I eat it he went out before one drop of rain every hit the earth he was gone the true license city now I'm going to ask you how many of you but only honest and action it and said I'd always connected that Enoch would walk off the earth they look like that no one of them would go through the tribulation you better read much right there to find that what note would represent some honey and watch that's right not one drop of rain he was going with tribulation city Noah was in the arc you didn't say it right up come over right he had hard times but he was in the art no tribulation to no one you ninny ark he gets rolled up and rode over honey watch now before he tribulations it a lot without sodomy the man of God loves he was out of Sodom before in tribulation Cillian new and the church will be gone before he Tribulation Period now here in the Tribulation Period that will be the sleeping virgins will be hunted down and all of the things and the multitudes will be killed but get the point Enoch mother even though I was in the arc and a lot without a solemn so no wonder bread around says you have no Scripture if you get the ball I'm talking about yeah we're gonna say well we got stripped her for going he say where's your fitness they know what you don't know why he was in the end up he was in a true relation with run said no he was in the our little bit trouble going on that sadly than our they might have said well lot look at him it's a yell at luck without a shot before the fire rain down there's no scripture whatsoever then put the right across in the tribulation the way you'll purge your fart if the blood of Jesus Christ purges us now if you don't believe it purges enough now I guess that's right you know you can think that about lift an excellent now watch all these will be tied together now let's start tying it together with the revelation where the bride goes up this is the breach between the church edges masiela spreader graft 2363 317 evening now we're going to turn to the fifth chapter and this is not the seals it's the bridge between the church ages and the seven seals now there is also a sixth chapter and there was a fourth chapter of Revelation and that it kind of reveals something that would take place after the church point up that the church goes up on the third chapter of Revelation and does not return until the nineteenth chapter of Revelation see therefore the church misses the tribulation a man he said that was contrary for an ear out of teachers leading you up they've got all mankind top that this ol holdover from the Catholic Church trying to find a purgatory to purchase or something to do huh but now notice what he said the church goes up revelations third chapter in other words the end of the third chapter then you're going to read it to church goes up to 4 chapter now you're going to go up to 30 big one pit forward the ending of the third is the opening of the fourth if you've ever one time study the seals on that line if you've ever study the seals on that one line I thought the Prophet said the sealed was like building up set of steps right now would it be something brother Gary to say well okay now we're going to bypass the bottom we're gonna start with step 3 I tell really hearing that I don't you feel me some step but I want you to leave off the two bottom ones he said I can do it but while have you start on the sandwiches come day no they got nothing to hold it up right so the end of the first seal is when the second seal open the end of the second seal is when the third seal open the bride goes up in the end of the last verse of Revelations 322 I think if she goes up which would be the opening of the next because it's a burn that step the god is calling up for one is calling it up are you understanding right that you're ending on 33 22 go for one is you going up to seek something and see that time together the whole entire Bible don't watch what he says that little number let's go to number 12 this is the fifth seal 1963 322 all right well a few paragraph 87 but the reason that he reveals that I have I understand that it is because the mystery of the book of redemption as far as the Antichrist being revealed now that's the ending of the fourth seal this is in the fifth seal the ending of the fourth seal is showing the Antichrist revealed and you're going through this thing that it covers the church and Dom tree right here and at the same time the church is gone these things don't even happen in the church age y'all never be in the fakirs tonight gold any money the seals in the thing'll actor we're going to read exactly where they happen with the next book that's right there away from the church aid the church absolutely fractured at this time the church goes up in the fourth chapter of Revelation and does not return until it on back with his King in the nineteenth chapter he seals here are revealing what has been what is and what will be and now what was to be for the church age was revealed body sale Lisa steals reveal what's going on with church hey look the next me he says the revelation of Jesus Christ 1960 1204 the morning service my graph 24 word I do all of that because some people here in tapes knew they even see it over with our with somebody you're in tight your decisions long ago joelma set up with a quote for the evening service I gave them to him it's morning I have a think I better go get something straight im gonna go out there and call for a quote they don't yet now going out and i said brother Joe we're gonna take over number eight no from there he said that number eight in the evening service no that's number eight the mortise there's so you know you got your back stretch so when I call off these things it's better with me calling that the places are defined you all right like somebody out tradition to Ted over what stalking me now revelation all right this is prayer at playboy the first three chapters deal for the church Linda Church disappear we see it no more until the end time come on Revelation 1 2 3 is the church huh revelation for 219 is Israel a nation and 19 to 22 is both together then the plagues in the morning so forth at the end Kenny three parts and we're taking the first three chapters pertaining to the church huh so there's better than order you know exactly how spicy all right see then a bride is no problem the other thing the bride goes up they go into the next it was a 12-8 you look at someone you got the extra notes you had to get an extra piece of paper this is the fifth single 1963 322 my graph to 18 and that far at this time if you'll notice this till so you'll be an open now this is opening of fifth still see the church is gone it's just be just be it it just can't be the souls under the early church now now please if you ever did give this attention get attention now now this is a great controversy Joe want you to listen real close man you got your papers and things right now I know what you know now these cannot be them sold because the the souls of the of the righteous martyr no Matt debridement the righteous people the church the ride and done bid took up so they would have been under the show they wouldn't be under the altar right they'd be in glory with the bride now what are they are gone in the rapture in the fourth chapter of Revelation they was taken up now who are the soul in other words where these other is Israel under the fifth seal right but you see there's no problem dealing with the fifth seal and the sixth seal to try to push it away and say that it's not to the ride because its fifth seal showed them the altar six sealants the tribulation nobody runs along so what about the settlement that's let me say it in a way that maybe you understand the opening of the seals is the revealing of Jesus Christ in the bride because he just told you that we missed the tribulation he just told you under the fifth seal the test not us are sold under the altar no we're already gone it's a revealing of Jesus Christ it is behind comedy flick the next this is from the Feast of the drunk 1964 719 one in church paragraph 36 37 now begin to notice that the preaching of the seven church ages which is a pattern are the forecast of all that God was going to do with the churches and through the churches and Polly positionally setting them up the first three chapters of book of revelation revealed all the happenings unto the church the end from the third chapter unto the 19th chapter of Revelation there is no more scene of the church now remember he's talking about Brian he's not saying church like worldly church you told that bride he called her chart right that's not no more scene of the church the church filled it up into fourth chapter of Revelations and return back in the nineteenth chapter that's moving riding back with him you don't come in a one-horse it the bride and the groom together coming to the earth and then from the nineteenth chapter is conclusive of the 22nd chapter it's all on the millennium and what will be in the ureters to follow during the fourth to the nineteen guard is dealing with Israel right huh now if that be true what would be the problem of understanding that the CEO for not to us the revelation of the seals are not I don't want it right over our see what happens in the tribulation to you I don't even one beer / rounded I certainly wouldn't want to go even to see the field sealed modern Jews right no brother on said it was the Jews from the time of matt baer hearing away he said underling I me the time of Christ it come over to the time of Christ when I get right the fifth sealed you is from the time of Christ and the crucifixion and then through the dark ages of the times they had funny that's your fifth seal jus all right those has been giving their lives I wouldn't want to visit that with you why can't church then we just simply sat down and read the Bible as I said this morning to find ourselves and find what God is thinking about us sure there's a lot of problems in that like I've always said do you think renren said did you think those Jews would have wrote about Abraham giving his wife away line and everything you know there to there to start you with you they're too proud of her leads yeah yeah but they had to ride it those prophets had to write what are you sure John seeds in the church ages I said the other day the bad side but that's all we look at well that's right it shows that's where we had like one brother here in this church one time he said he said I see myself as that first seal denied my horse rider he said then come on over to the fourth now get straight now I said if you see yourself there's a white horse ride are you lost yeah we know naturally that really thrilled the experience yeah you know about that I mean it really thrilled it for me to say that dude but if you think you're the right oh it's rather than you all because there are two sets of East there's a deer on and then there's the beast is called the bride remember the four for combat lease was down to the church named mr. Braddock rise that's the combat we see the deer on base are untouchable that's right amen there's no right to the control why would you want to see yourself and uncontrollable of course it's a great revelation I was once uncontrollable and then I got converted now I'm controllable now you can be your horse until little lucky would be careful they'll get you an anybody gets to change but if you love me to fight for you it loves you difference in these yep so the bride goes up in Revelations for one and she's not seeing the more to 19 21 when she writes back with him then why we want to think that we're over there why do we want to study the sealed or anything to try to see how bad we are I thought we would read the book to find out how good we are but our problem is we're trying to find out how we're good we are I trying to be good or sales remember it is neither hath made us not we ourselves right that's Bible he's the one that's made is perfect why is it you and I as the natural people no matter how good we are we would be due to we deserve to go to the trim lunch right we deserve to go to hell it's best if we could do Evan was he eaten by the way we don't have to you might away we don't have to go through the tribulation I'll try to get you to see that even if you look into the John riding through the chapter two or three of the church a jury wraps of the bad suree rocks that they're leavin spirits and things like that in the ages of none but then he also he never ends it until he writes about the overcome and now perfect GU moment we want to think about being in the tribulation well bro today we got that right now brother and said without going through tribulation look I just can't see that other part about the seals more not what amazes sales reveal handicraft the Holy Spirit reveals Jesus friend right by a man no man could go Jesus the Christ except it be by the Holy Spirit right there's my one of these days you'll realize what that prophet was saying I'm brother Ray said you start off the first seal run around send the seals ready lieutenant knows the individuality it is only one seal that's right six of the seal is broke and Jesus crafts me preach them in the Bible they would only one seal to be revealed in time it was a Holy Spirit he's the only revealer of the word me sure we look at you receive the sealed an agent hey what about us being able to hear now leave it the man of sin will be sitting in the temple of God shortens have to be as God now in the tribulation and yet you and I can see it now before it ever takes place there are you now / even in the message of where they ain't supposed to be no more pokes in this life nobody's supposed to be number so-and-so I don't even know how many they say my god I forgot that many woods they're supposed to be so many folks and this is posted this max guy coming up supposed to be the likes of number-wise well could that be the same thing that everybody said we had to go in a rapture in 1973 could it be the same way was it matter to me who the Pope is the Pope I'm worried about is that nickel ATM spirit that is trying to conquer the Leia and the Conqueror the ministry said we're Minister spike well bless and neglect cover lately don't cover me no it's already guessed already gosh yeah well I sit right middle of an antichrist system believe in the doctrine of this message nice now you know we're about Devon getting you you've already got you with Z church God shows us we don't have to go through the trouble I had he send this concrete proof but he takes us up for touched money and then we're not in there any word until revelations not kidding you know where we're at work and glory you know what brought around said about it one day you've talking about the Jews the 144,000 I'm sure fronting the sick see what he's talking about he said well we're up there to marriage supper are you explaining this one but that's what he said he said he'll slip back he'll leave us during slip back down here and reveal itself to the Jews now we're gonna be running around with thrill out of here looking for me nah bigger speech bigger speech man knee you know the Corporal body laid on the throne the Spirit of God is down here with us gives us the dead nope he's real busy amen you won't Spitzer he's real busy in my father's house are many mansions if we're not so would have told you I go to prepare a place for you but around them on the future home cities affair right now preparing a place for the onion that's on a horse spirit down here the body repairs would have to be lifeless that's what you're thinking that's why you need to get rid of your carnality right you're talking about God in His ladies because he doesn't come down physically to reveal himself to the Jews wait a minute where you get the reference no they see him by revelation he doesn't come back physically to the earth and feel the millennial reign right so then when he reveals itself to the Jews it won't be a corporal body right we'll still be right there wasn't having a good time to marriage something you know what brother Brent said they do he said he'd wipe the tears of our eyes and say well done to make sure we're gonna be crying in heaven sadness are happy you a lot of people get happy they start crying right let me start crying here did before that he is down line right well because it happy listen jerk this is the only point I want to get across got it on the enter the next did you read revelations folder there's going to be a throne but read it real careful my round speaks of the salad seal and he said revelation 81 is the same s ii we got SCE in heat same to the Seventh Seal where nothing else is not really said a scene if we take the book of Revelation to think of the symbolic ssin and think of the scene that we're talking about like I said John looks up to see you drive through an open door he saw Jesus now you're going to have to enter in to heaven for the next scene to open and the same job having only open one scene at the time just like a bloody unfolded the next one phone read revelations for one you'll see one comp now when john goes up he mentioned again that he gets in the spirit just like he did when he started back over here and relations one he saw throne you know it's always on we've seen on both he saw one sitting on the front you don't worry about because God had revealed everything to you and I at one time we couldn't take it that's right we couldn't stand it you money he unfolds what we have need of he shows us the same we just wait let the prophet tell us what that is but John sought throne after he got in him you wasn't on earth looking for a throne you didn't help ever then he saw one on the throne they saw rainbow about the Trump ladies all 24 elders it just keeps unfold is that not the actual play a movie that you see we just remember revelations for one all that you're seeing in between there is going to be related to it which showed it do this for me or you see why brother Adam saying he was going to issue you remember that you remember that he was going to Israel program was going to issue you already had his ticket never mind my people come to humor the with addie cost of the deep when the two men came to they said well your ministry brother round the Jews will accept it number in the video he was headed that way and his teeth he landed in one place over her and everyone around looking while they were going around looking again Lord spoke to its at kumon behind a hang or something talk to you he said the naked Tillman rice is not fulfilled yet you can't go you know what he couldn't go you realize if he went Israel would have accepted it right there right in the Providence of God you and I wouldn't have been part of it Oh the hell was old enough to be back Darwin runarounds ministry somewhere mighty close to work that he made no statements of trying to go that make him be the only one in the building would have an opportunity I don't believe that he said the Nick with you our house is not full field he said don't go he turned and went down through Cairo each other i guess or something then went out when you think those people thought when he said I can't go right I'm running around why we done got the tickets get everything ready you need a wet bar with a massage sign what do you think they would have done why because all this over there is just books and tapes this message is in this room I'm actually viewed it when not an inner what we viewed it off of work run for a great actually put this message and run around picture only the news media there but they're not going to accept it no it's not their time but it's yours in that time right there's the time to understand who we are and what we're doing here day event and only those for the Holy Spirit will get a full understanding of what's going on and to see the others that don't have would just argue running down what do you mean you leaving bread rack mounted it's goofy you said we were going up for one you wouldn't see no more I didn't say that but around here you get your mind in the great border first I voted what he said that's right with my revelation we were to see the blood of Jesus Christ don't take this the record i am at we don't have to go to look tribulation a man who's the next thing this world strikes after the rapture this ride is a tribulation you think this is a problem that'll be the wrath of God when the Bible says they'll even pray to die they will cry for the rocks to fall on in and hide them clever but we're in the time the work is to preach a relation what about six many six million Jews killed in a preacher of life no under aight let him earn it right what about over here the whole world's going to lead to see by the Antichrist yeah right like I've tried to tell you years ago about it it's not to un it goes after the two witnesses to kill 144,000 it's the Jews right back where they were when they were killing the Apostle the natural Israel is going to go after the 140-foot how does the natural Israel will be an opponent with me enter crash that's how deceiving you will be but you're not can lead to see a bad vibe they were to see we're lost that's the best way pudding we're lost right at least we were to be able to say you're not saying what policy a try to ban propensity be glad if they don't tell it boys but like on these tiny measure we miss the tribulation we miss the wrath of God being poured out there man because we're done don't interaction but now the summit of what i'm trying to say but we're the ride they have apples and by being the ride God has unfolded the entire book even from where we are throughout all the rest of the world even told us about the future home and all of the past my way of the Prophet message yeah the symbols are all broken the war we can understand that the bride is no longer a symbol she's a reality amen let's come in musicians mr. make on these lands we are the bride of Jesus Christ we get the whole book to be able to read it and how the Holy Spirit to bring it to us and make it manifest
