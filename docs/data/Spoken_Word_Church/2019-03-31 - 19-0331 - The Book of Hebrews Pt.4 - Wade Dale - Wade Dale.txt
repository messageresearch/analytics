TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] alright alright let's go in we're in chapter 2 of Hebrews thank you all for being here we we already talked about something so we're not gonna go those let's go to verse 11 and backed up and went to verse 14 but let's go to verse 11 what can't increase chapter 2 for both heated sanctifies and they knew are sanctified are all of one you turn everything on yeah but I need to make a note right here with notes for mojitos sanctify that they are saying goodbye to all one because he's talking about Jesus Christ for weeks cause he has not ashamed to call them brethren because what happened while we were talking last Sunday verse 9 but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the Angels see what we're talking about in our illustration here's the here is eternity of this way and here is time down this way right now the creator and the creation began in eternity and then when the fall happened then we had time alright so this is an eternal line here of those eternity is always up here to hope of God he was the son of God the Creator the one to create and what did he do is is when the fall happened he had to this man despair God had to become a flesh died to take away our sin because least I had my new sending their flesh they didn't send her soul her soul is eternal they send in their flesh alright and it was animal flesh someone asked one time I kind of want to clear this out someone a small talent it's a good question someone said well why did God put us in this kind of flesh with you understand what a man with the organs and everything that we are the human male and female if he knew what we were gonna do well seeing creative evolution which we believe in creative evolution God created the animals first well they were procreating with a male part in the female part before even up in here when God created the heavens in the earth and created everything before the sixth day when he created animals they were procreate and they were having babies okay but what happened when God he took and just put up this is not this is sure this is human flesh but this is animal flesh this is animal this so what God couldn't God couldn't get away from the pattern of a male female dog the male and female cat mental female this so when he took Eve out of the side of Adam he put her in a female body of flesh according to what he had already created in the animals and he put Adam in male flesh from what the male party is of the animal kingdom so he and then remember the everybody's trying to find the missing link we all were in school trying to find the missing link when we know what was that beast oh god in creative evolution he creates creates great grades up higher higher higher fifth day creates the beast in the animals we created the beast which is the Matt one between McKean and man all right he gave that species but human-like body we say human my body but really work this is just this is flesh animal it comes from animal you know we know we're human no you don't get me wrong but in creative evolution God pit and create mentally mMmmm female and then that's with no way to reproduce but we weren't supposed to reproduce that way who's supposed to reproduce by the spoken word which come from the inside this guy right here is all male no doubt son of God is a male he's a man he's not a woman in demand alright but you know it doesn't take a woman for him to create he created without sure we were all inside that they wouldn't allowed but they're one that's the two people standing up there it was one Creator God but when he come down here in human flesh to take away the sin first he had to come through a one a human one to take the same curse away up even from the womb all the way down alright so so it's not and then like the other man said when we go back to that theophany body which is inside of us it's not going to be it's not going to be for sexual pleasure or anything like that it's going to be the spoken word is the original seed sure God's got a bride and we all are feminine in nature but that person inside of us is not a girl in person inside was a man Christ Jesus in spirit form now again and the son of God that come to the church ages but he had to come down in flesh because what this is man blood son of man is man if God was blood then I got that that's what the son of man that's why brother Graham could not beat thee son of man he was born sexual birth no one born sexual birth is good no one period so brother Branham was not the Son of Man Jesus Christ the Son of Man because he was born without sex at all men you and I were in every spawn a total in the Philippines I see you look around us and I might be an American you I feel Filipino you might be a lifter that we come the exact same way no one came different we all come by say every person on the face of this earth I don't care if it's artificial insemination it came by the act of a male or female they had to be an act of something being done so but not with this man so this is the son of man but he had to come back to be the head so at least be the body he had a physical body on earth but he took that physical body over into another dimension and now we're his body were the bride we're the bride where the body is us all right which makes us like mother Dale's preaching and we are in in time we are these not a man as a collective body of believers we believe that now God is trans forming from the inside out changing us into that form this inside of us that's why that I don't say does it Joe the people like sister cleaning the ones that are heading toward their end seemingly in their older age there there's that close to their debacle until they took a change you say no they're gonna die on one thing cuz there's our live time they don't step over in another dimension yeah be more alive than they are here because in here you got pain and suffering and all that stuff but over there there's not so I just want Christ came let's see it was made lower than the Angelus no angel created by God can be a son of man or a son of God okay angels are created beings for worship now they do make a choice because Satan made a choice those guys that I made you perfect Ezekiel I made you perfect until iniquity was found in you so he made a choice and part of the Angels made a choice to go Satan that's who's bothering us now the part of them did okay so they do make the choice but they aren't they they're not ever in flesh their their worship beings they're actually God's helpers as we read in verse one are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them that shall be heirs of salvation who's there of salvation we are we're the only ones that are the heirs of salvation right mm-hmm that I can see today you understand what I'm saying but you're giving an angel the Prophet to God told us yeah aim to have birth to take care of you now that's not your theophany I've heard people in the nation's preach to that was in no way your theophanies not maintain your being often it is you your theophany is I don't understand that I really know I don't understand that that that God gives you a God gives you a spirit I think what that is that spirit being the inside you it somehow it has to be once this come down here because remember Jesus Christ when he was born he was Almighty God he didn't have a spiritual being of no one else okay his nature was the nature of God but remember when he was at now that didn't make when he come out of the crib he stood up and started speaking no he was for a lack of words he was encapsulated in him in a human body and could not get out he had to be to be our brother and he had to be born just like we are in that way not not my safe but by that way through the womb but when he come out he was Almighty God about 50 was Emmanuel God with us all right but he had the growing grace of knowledge the Bible said he had to he had was made per being made perfect why because he was encapsulated by that humanity then he come into all right but now see that's different for me you we weren't born with the Holy Spirit as our spirit we were born with a spiritual part of us memory reason conscious facing imagination now remember those things don't develop much until you're older you don't have you don't have a memory when you were sucking your bottle so you're developing that but now the soul is inside of you I don't know this little baby I just I don't at that part of donors name because remember the age of accountability is when you begin to make a choice of your memory reasoning conscious affection imagination because it's not bad for a five-year-old kid to imagine thing or use their you don't have much of a memory but my brother Brown said you put the five year old boy in the five year old girl in the in the bathtub give a shower they play with their toys and don't even worry about anything else going on but don't put a fifteen year old kid in the 15 a 15 year old boy a 50 little girl in the showers you get a whole different idea I think huh probably yes you so but you face the same two people but what's developed in their mind is what I'm saying is about even with Jesus he wasn't he didn't come out of the womb quoting scripture yeah he wasn't Word made flesh he had to develop as a child now when he got 13 years old which I believe after her brother Brian kind of got his because listen you can't I need some accountability brother Brown says it's when you realize right from wrong that can be 13 or 30 and with some that and this is another thing say we can what are we getting in Bellevue well that's the only question you know but listen what about a one about somebody's now listen God didn't give a soul I give them perfect soul but what they were born into their genetic makeup some way and their spiritual being got messed up somewhere because God didn't put a slow learning soul or alimony bucks they were targeted but remember brother Graham said they'll go to heaven they have a special angel he said it a special angel is given to a person why because he knows that's going on he's gonna hurt him all through this life and that's why just for an example like like Donnie's brother Tommy he was hurt at Birth by five or six your goalies in the car car run over himself well he's been slow and not right well he's got a more chance to get to heaven then I told them did some of them brothers said that to think their religion he's got one good chance of getting into heaven which I believe you will because God said to a prophet then when somebody's like that we'll see that's not it his salts not but what happened to what he was living in was messed up okay so you see that's why I thank God brother Brown give us a definition of a body a spirit of salt and even told us that you could commit suicide and still be a born-again believer now but that don't fly in denomination denomination especially the Baptist if you commit suicide that's your straight ticket to Haiti there is no maybe trust me I've talked to them they said no there's no way no that's it man they just lose their mind yeah I just lost their mind and did what they did you know but thank God for a prophet they come separated all that out for us and gave us the definition of a body spirit result but Jesus Christ came on earth made his self lower than the Angels all right which we got there in verse nine he was made lower than the Angels why because an angel didn't walk around him in this dimension in human flesh no their spiritual beings they can move in and out they they're not completely in that box like I said before you and I got caught in the box when that really did what they did there's here you go you've got three dimensions and you're stuck in then you are stuck in three dimension laughs like matter for this radio waves and we can't pick up can you pick it away from your head now some people may think I bought it today but you think one of them let's go Christ when he came though he hadn't be stuck in them three dimensions here to be around right to be and to be our total example to even be the headship that's why we can't understand this guy here how can you understand it God that just what was he standing on when he created them don't matter he had to be somewhere brother Graham said he's not a spirit like that he's not like he's not spiritless just there's a fog just he's always been human or we were made Foggs just as one said let us make man in our likeness and then our image mm God's always been a human being always been a human being but what was he standing on when he said let there be over here this galaxy with the seven billion stars and let there be this over here but that same person came down here and human flesh so that we can understanding come he said I came from God and go back to God well there wasn't gravity okay there's been that somewhere but you guys I want to say that we could not comprehend that's why in the Old Testament there was no comprehension of God he was just this something so massive that that we couldn't understand him and even when he went when Moses went up on Mount Horeb to get to to get the word of the Lord you know remember the the people said no to you Moses you going up there and get it no God want to talk to all the people because he told Moses he said you bring your people to this mountain when you get out of Egypt and I'll tell them all of it remember what they said no Moses you going up and get them you know they were scared they were afraid of this big guy thank God but we're not because remember we can now come boldly to the throne of grace we come boldly to this what do you remember this man in spirit form would come down into the temple into the Holy of Holies and you can even look at him except use the high priest and you hadn't do exactly what was said or they drug you out there remember they couldn't even touch the are members of godly I mean one what about a nice guy like Thailand he sees the are getting ready to tip over and he reaches up push your heart back up God kills it while he couldn't break us a lot its lawsuit you couldn't touch ER but thank God we can touch it now we can touch this thing now subscribe because he this great one became he funneled itself down to this man called Jesus Christ right which is the son of man which was making over the Angels he took on man blood or man flesh listen brother Brown said Jesus could have had children so that means he in all functions he was a male all functions so he wasn't this elevated something well we know he was inside but he was in calculated like I said in the human body he obviously had asleep head they they had new things while but he sanctified himself remember I set myself apart i sanctify myself for this situation which is wonderful but we see Jesus it was made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death those remember he can't die here son of God never never never died the son of man died now when the Son of man died he released that that was caught inside of him which was the Son of God he released that life to go back into theophany form alright the oppening form is not some midst of rain it's a person God's always look like he did he never changed he's always like I said before he's always been a twenty year old guy always he's never been old yes body is real it's a real body it is not a we put your hand through you know Jesus even proved that even in a glorified body when he came back he walked through a concrete wall yet he ate fish right remember he appeared in front of them and then disappeared out of their sight you know if you have anybody that eat a piece of fish and it didn't hit the floor it it went somewhere God got a stomach yeah I'm stone you'll how it's done you're human but now remember there is there is a connection there because remember those people across the curve the time said we don't eat over here so you have to be careful they don't eat or he's remember they told him we don't eat over here what they're waiting to come back and get the body they ate in this body yes so they come back and get this body it meshes together makes it glorify just like Jesus did mm-hmm so that's what crowned him with glory and honor property God said hanging on a cross that's okay but when he come out of that tomb instead of all power in heaven earth has been given unto me no man had ever done that before oh yeah they've been people raised from the dead we know that but nobody had ever went from mortal to immortality that's what the Bible says no man has reached immortality except one man and that's Jesus Christ that's why my brother Brian wanted to see Jesus he was back up here in this dimension where you couldn't see him he was in the seventh dimension but he took that glorified body with it remember this body had to be made eternal Jesus Christ's body got an inheritance it was eternal life preached that many times before many times brother Brown says the eternal life that he inherited so he describes when he came on this earth as the son of man he didn't ever he didn't have eternal body he looked fifty years old he was only thirty so his body was wore out right so obviously that wasn't eternal but at one time when I was standing other day when he walked out of that tomb he didn't have that old body anymore he was a young boy that's my Mary Magdalene didn't know who he was he turned back to a twenty year old person he he he had connected back with a theophany that was inside of him that guy they said let us make man that's why he discussed it before Abraham was I am the I am was back there Jesus Christ put them back there the flesh man the I am was back there though this is he I am right here the Sun God see I am Moses I am that I am Jesus dead before Abraham was I am then you come over to Revelation 20 I am the Alpha and Omega I am all these things alright that's what we're trying to get the people in Philippines to see we'll talk a little bit about today to see that now that if that guy is the I am then if he's inside of you ones that make you that makes you the I am I come from God I go back to God we don't start believing that we're going to keep going we're just gonna keep dying we have made ourselves a second person separate from God that's what we're dying you ain't hair and dress and no TV washing dishes and whatever you know it's a laundry death no well if we don't truly believe that now our flesh in hi flesh we are going to make manifest in another form called a bride we're just going to keep that because the son of man proved that the body change can happen this guy didn't need a body since I didn't need no change in he ain't changed since eternity but this man to come down to be your brother that flesh he was then had to be made eternal so he inherited eternal life in his flesh you and I may inherit eternal life in the flesh Jesus didn't come to grant you an inheritance no if he come to bring you an inheritance he had a beginning he came to return us back to our inheritance what God cut off was when this was went into time that could offer our inheritance of being spoken word children there has no one listens there has no one since Adam been a spoken word child except that man right there but by the word coming back in the in town in the son of man ministry to prove that God is now in human flesh your flash in my flesh that we can take a body change while we're standing on earth we don't have to die okay I committed to me that's the whole essence of this message the essence of this message is not hair and grass and being good that was way before brother Graham got here it was lost in the traditions of doctrine of denomination brother Branham came back to brother Brennan Jesus Christ came back three-way and ran to tell us that we are now sons and daughters of God we are the son of man made manifest we are God in human flesh brother brand a long time ago preach God in flesh and then maybe we wanted to head to India trip so he's outside that is it was his whole goal was to turn us back and to bring this revelation of who this man was that he's not appearing anymore sure he came back in the form of the Holy Ghost the Son of God to go inside of you but still that's not all because if he just got the Holy Ghost inside of you you gonna die I'm just gonna prove it to you it's happening already it's been happening brother branham's dead rotate them brother mode brother duncan i hold on sister doctor they've all passed on they're over there in their company having a wonderful time in the Lord and another dimension waiting on us to destroy death over here because why don't you come back into a place that they're still death and they will be to the outside world but in Goshen where the bride is death will be destroyed we're not gonna get anywhere but we see Jesus who'd make a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor see that's why I'm I think you know that's why Pilate didn't care everybody they were going wow this guy's wanting to make himself a king no the Jews this time to make yourself a king Pilate said are you trying to make yourself a king what did Jesus say he said if my kingdom was it this there in other words if my kingdom was of this earth you were now change you and how jams they said my kingdom not of this world policy hey Jim it's just a lunatic like the rest of them let him go let him play take his little group and go out in the desert you know and he'll just die normal death like that other guy did member the Bible said somebody took 400 out into the wilderness and they all perished well that's what Pilate was not fearful of hit Jesus that left the kingdom in his kingdom in Pilate Kingdom you understand that's why he said oh I find no fault in this man and then of course you know the Jews what they did they don't want him to be the king so anyway so that's what happened he by the grace of God should taste death for every man which he did it's not a man died God can't die but the Son of God inside the son of man was captured inside that body and had to be broken to be released and that's what happened to Calvary he broke open and he released the body into thy hands I commend my spirit no man till Jesus he died himself he died when he wanted to die he didn't die when somebody made him die he died when he wanted to die right for it become became him for whom are all things the Creator and by him all things in bringing many times on this glory which is up to make the captain of our salvation perfect through suffering so Christ was made perfect through suffering for both he that sanctifies and they they are sanctified are all of one they didn't say - this is one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren and then the midst of the church last thing praised under they and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I am the children which God hath given me for as much then as children as the children are partakers of flesh and blood that's you and me we protect numbers not eat we're potatoes when we were born we were flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same what'd I just say baby was born in the womb he was a little baby he cried he had to have milk and learn to walk he didn't just come out of the womb quoting scripture and walking into the temple no there's nothing to talk about of him until about thirteen years old and then he goes into the temple and like I said I believe that maybe for a brother I'm kind of got the age of Kalin deal accountability of being about thirteen to sixteen thirteen to fourteen years old go there was Jesus in the temple talking to the priest so he had learned some things right all right so now let's sing with it share part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil because when this happened and we stepped out into town we stepped into who's Satan's domain we fell that's why they call it the fall we fell from something but now what does redemption do though Redemption tation from whatever you fell to it takes you back to free fell from okay and deliver them that through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage and it's still happening now that's been 2,000 years ago the same thing happening now right for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of Abraham remember he I think was the natural seed of Abraham Christ is the spiritual seed liquor because remember it says in Galatians not to seeds as of many but one seed which is Christ that one seed is come from the faith seed of Abraham not the natural genetic seed a natural genetic sperm seed will kill you I don't care what you where you put it and whatever happens we're dead in that that's what killed animes what's this list of having the liberal act primarily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of Abraham we're for in all things it behooves him to be made like unto his brethren us that he might be merciful and it might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people now there's no sin from here up this is the eternal line remember there's no sin up here he gotta bring himself down into sin he went born in sin but he was born in sin they sinful place he was not born in sin he was born in a sinful place hey why does his body get old because he was born in a sinful place the fall everything you fell down all right but remember like I said when he come out that tune he went no 30 year old man who looked 50 please Lord know that the offing inside that man was never got older than 20 years old that's why I believe brother Graham took that 20 years old the problem why God that listen God's not one millisecond older than he was when he said let there be life we just don't understand that but when he came down here and became the son of man we understand him more because now we can talk about going back to that parent saying well he's not he's not this guy never got old with this guy dead he got old because of me and you didn't get old but he needed to or what he to him he got old because of me in you wherefore and all things that behooves him to be made like into his brethren that he might be merciful and faithful and faithful high priest what to us he's not high priest by what she a priesthood opening eyes at 51 which one did that piece of do Peter Pete stop where did I believe that report who has declared who will declare the generation on their feet soon to become my faithful high priest in things pertaining to God Comerica for the sins of the people see we don't know what we don't understand is is Christ can do nothing else but what he did on the cross and what he did coming out of the tomb he can do nothing else beside that we just have not come to a position of believing that it's already done it's finished I mean there's really there's nothing that Christ is going to come back to do except get his people for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted arrested he was tempted of women Mary Magdalene was a prostitute he live didn't live with her you understand me but he lived in the same household because it flatters him Magdalene Margaret Martha thank you they all live together I mean they lived in the same area Lazarus yelled actors were there with mom you'll read you'll see them all kind of together sometimes you know so so I'm sure he was tempted but he is able to secure or to aid or help them that are tempted that's us okay that's ice now remember man put chapter 3 in there this is a continuous rhyming of Paul he's riding a lever and this is a continual riding because he's continuing his thought man put that chapter three of them so what's he saying where for what it's where for listen to what I was just saying because I'm gonna sum maximize this whole thing up right here wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession he narrows it down to one man Christ Jesus all of that in Chapter one and two it started off a chapter 1 God willing sometimes a diner with divers manners spake to the prophets speak through the prophets now speaks through his son well he's your son Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house for this man was kind worthy of more glory than Moses Michael he's Almighty God as much as he who have builded the house had more honor than the house Christ built house Moses didn't build house you understand what a man he built the natural temple but guys want to build everything else in other words you go back to the same thing about the the Potter and the clay how can we there's no way we can say you made me this way there's no way you can say that all right don't everybody's made with a choice for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is God want khalida created he created all things Hey and Moses barely was faithful in all this house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after hour afterwards but Christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if being worth nothing if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm and to the end okay remember I told you one of my favorite scriptures he doing doors to the end shall be saved that's that's really a promise you got to endure to the end listen we've been in this thing a long time now and you say why wait well got no results well then you just not eat it maybe you're not part of the results maybe you're not part of the results if you don't see that there's any result or anything going on in your life then don't blame anybody else blame yourself yeah if you do what God said you might change the blessed but Christ is the son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and resourcing of the hope firmament to the end wherefore as the Holy Ghost that said today if you will hear his voice know what watch here is remember we talked about interpolating for those you work here it's not interpretating it's interpolating means it means that that you're going to stop just a second and and you're going to make this square for if you take all that take this out see that parentheses over there it ends right here so Paul is interpolating he actually introduced this itself to explain what he's fixing to talk about because look it's supposed to say wherefore wherefore wherefore take heed brethren lest there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from women cause that's the way it should have been written but Paul interpolates wherefore stop a minute I'm going to explain what this where forward is going to be wherefore as the Holy Ghost said today of you we hear his voice actually most of the time when Paul interpolates he's quoting you the Old Testament khalakka say it's actually an Old Testament scripture almost verbatim as the Holy Ghost said today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation now what is that that's back in the of children of Israel in the wilderness they were provoking God that's what provocation means our rebellion and the day of the temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempted me proved me and saw my work 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in their heart and they have no no way so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest he's explaining what he one God's fixed in one God room told Paul right now I'm sure God told him to write this because it wouldn't be in the Bible if he would but that was the great Apostle Paul interpolating and telling us explaining to us what God has told him to write down cuz watch what did this talked about this talked about that generation we preach on this because what you will see in some of the things this afternoon the the theme of brother Royals anniversary meetin was the Joshua generation the ones that rose up and went over because the old ones did not they did not enter into the Promised Land now the promised land is rest the Holy Ghost is I promised land it's a type of what they went over into if I understand that one what the children of Israel went over into was the rent you know they went the old fighters all died it was only Joshua Caleb and the young people that were twenty years old and younger that started to journey well they had grown up and got older but all those old fighters had died God had to get rid of it cuz he told him he said they're all dead maybe Jesus didn't we man in the wilderness and Jesus together all dead that were damned is eternally separated they'd had to halt die off because why they were unbelievers Joshua Caleb was only to true believers that started the whole journey right they were the only ones who believed and then they got the other group to start believing all right look they shall not enter no my wrist so now wherefore take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief see that's what I was trying to give us the see but he told palm to go back into the Old Testament and bring up a group of people that were known believers departing from the Living God that's that whole interpolating right there if you ever see that the parentheses that is Paul explaining what's coming up there okay with it take heed brethren lest there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from believing God but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made protectors of Christ if we if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end not let's go let's start right there next time [Music] yep that's where you're standing yep Aaron you take that back okay hit that button
