[0:05] Jeremiah chapter 32 so we were just
[0:13] reading in Leviticus chapter 25 how let
[0:21] me just summarize quick so ever every
[0:23] seven years you grow your crops and
[0:26] whatnot for six years and then every
[0:27] seven years you gotta rest yeah then 7
[0:30] times 7 is 49 over 49 years then on the
[0:34] on the tenth month or the seventh month
[0:36] on the tenth day if somebody would blow
[0:39] the trumpet I go out and throw the
[0:41] trumpet and that means that they did you
[0:42] hear the 50th you get to go free now now
[0:47] bring that on forward as if there's a up
[0:49] you know when you're looking at day in
[0:51] 70 weeks one of the things that to kind
[0:53] of put everything in context it's that
[0:55] one of the reasons that God sent them
[0:57] down in the battle on as if you read
[0:59] through think about Jeremiah 34 35 that
[1:03] Jeremiah begin to tell them look they
[1:07] sit on this it's the seventh year let
[1:10] all your that you're the people that are
[1:12] working for you and what not let him go
[1:14] free and and they did they let him go
[1:17] free they said we're going to obey the
[1:18] world order and and but then they change
[1:22] their mind they said no never mind we're
[1:24] gonna we're going to pull them all back
[1:26] into bondage and and and take all these
[1:29] you know are the people that would have
[1:32] been set free and whatnot and go back on
[1:35] our work and not obey the word of the
[1:37] Lord and then you know there's a few
[1:41] chapters after that phone Jeremiah God
[1:44] tells Jeremih to go go talk to the sons
[1:47] of the ring cab the reek of ice who
[1:50] their father had told him to to abstain
[1:53] from wine and so Jeremiah goes assist
[1:56] down in front of him and he puts mine in
[1:58] from them and says drink the wine and
[1:59] they said no I father told us not to
[2:01] drink wine so we're not going to do it
[2:02] and all these other things they told us
[2:05] to dwell in tents and all these all
[2:06] these kind of things and it becomes an
[2:08] example to the people of Israel Jeremiah
[2:11] goes back and says look the the children
[2:13] recap can obey their father and you
[2:17] can't obey your father they can obey
[2:20] what their father told them to do but
[2:22] your father told you to obey all these
[2:24] Commandments and things in Leviticus 25
[2:26] and elsewhere to not put huge burdens on
[2:30] your brothers and those kind of things
[2:32] so God sends them down into battle on to
[2:35] make sure that this rest comes to pass
[2:37] for 70 years so put kind of put that in
[2:41] context so and you know you can run that
[2:45] as you know go to brenham tall you can
[2:48] run that that 50 jubilee all down
[2:51] through the the Bible until it comes out
[2:53] in 1977 Milgram said that was the 70th
[2:57] Jubilee of the Leviticus 25 8 which is
[2:59] there a 49 so it's important to get that
[3:02] get that straight now it is 249 and then
[3:06] we can go free right but anyway I want I
[3:09] want to kind of go through Jeremiah
[3:11] chapter 32 before we start reading
[3:14] through this this whole chapter let's
[3:17] just go over and reverently Lord God me
[3:20] thank you for another opportunity to
[3:22] come into your to the house of the Lord
[3:23] to serve you and to hear about you or I
[3:25] pray as we go through this chapter or
[3:27] that you'll open it to us Lord Jesus be
[3:29] with the services our brother burly's
[3:31] with brother Wade but all the weeks over
[3:32] there
[3:33] granite mortgage will be with the
[3:35] services here at I church board and open
[3:37] the eyes about heart to hear you know
[3:39] more about you go Jesus and they grow
[3:41] closer to you to walk with you Lord we
[3:44] ask in the name of Jesus Christ yes yes
[3:50] city thank you it's good to watch out
[3:55] for one America all right now so so
[4:01] Jeremiah just to put put things in
[4:03] perspective aware where are the nation
[4:07] is right now they've been a battle to
[4:08] all these different countries flip
[4:10] flopping back and forth between the
[4:12] syria and egypt for from many years i
[4:15] got some numbers down ten hands of judah
[4:19] he got afraid years ago that the rules
[4:25] going to attack other things he goes
[4:26] down to assyria and appeals to their
[4:28] king TIG laughs policer of the
[4:31] neo-assyrian empire and judah becomes a
[4:34] part of the Syrian empire I become a
[4:36] vassal now and then from then on looked
[4:38] up until they go into captivity in
[4:39] Babylon a they keep flip flopping back
[4:41] and forth between the one now they're
[4:43] they're paying taxes and whatnot to
[4:46] Egypt and King nikka Federer Nico kills
[4:49] Josiah and now they're there they're
[4:53] flip flop back and forth through Syria
[4:55] and Babylon and and so at this point in
[5:00] time they're paying their like a vassal
[5:03] state to Babylon and they begin to the
[5:07] hip connacher and and so forth all the
[5:10] rulers begin to hear whisperings of
[5:12] revolt and they keep you know little
[5:14] revolts keep popping up and things so
[5:16] you know that's what eventually leads
[5:18] them to the Nebuchadnezzar just comes in
[5:21] and rolls over the place and just takes
[5:22] everybody day on the Hebrew children all
[5:25] the the prime people of the land takes
[5:28] them down into Babylon and and the 70
[5:33] years of captivity stars let's start
[5:35] reading to check
[5:37] chapter 32 the word that came to
[5:39] jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year
[5:41] of Zedekiah king of Judah which was the
[5:43] 18th year of nebuchadnezzar but then the
[5:47] king of Babylon zarna the seat Jerusalem
[5:49] and Jeremiah the Prophet was shut up in
[5:51] the court of the prison which was in the
[5:53] king of Judas house I this time Jeremiah
[5:57] is such a sad story such as sad from the
[6:01] natural eyes if you look at Jeremih he
[6:05] was constantly mistreated nobody
[6:06] listened to his prophecy and then at the
[6:08] end of a lot of his life he thought they
[6:10] did finally he gets to stay in the land
[6:12] after that everybody goes down into
[6:13] Babylon and the captain of
[6:17] Nebuchadnezzar army says you just stay
[6:19] here with the guy we're going to put in
[6:21] charge couple years later that guy gets
[6:23] assassinated and they take to your mind
[6:25] it's crap root down into Egypt and he's
[6:28] never heard from again so you know is
[6:32] that you look at you looked for with
[6:33] natural eyes are so many of God's people
[6:35] Isaiah that was Saul and a half and Paul
[6:38] that had his head chopped off it looks
[6:39] like their life and from the natural it
[6:41] looks like their lives just became to
[6:43] know but their life was totally killing
[6:45] over to God it was just everything they
[6:48] had to give it over to God he got what
[6:52] an example for us for them the king of
[6:55] bow was honored to see Jerusalem and
[6:57] Jeremiah the Prophet was shut up in the
[6:58] corner of the prison which was in the
[7:00] king of Judith's house this print prison
[7:03] was a little bit different maybe because
[7:05] it first falls in the King's house and
[7:07] you know he shut up but he can go in and
[7:09] out he can have people come to Yemen and
[7:11] talk to him and so he has a little bit
[7:15] of freedom I guess maybe a little bit
[7:16] like Paul I wasn't wrong or you could
[7:18] have people come to him and and sit with
[7:20] him and fellowship a little bit he was
[7:23] he was kind of shut up in a nice not not
[7:27] a thang a horrible prison but
[7:30] at this time later on that you know they
[7:32] throw him down that the whale and and do
[7:37] the other things to it for Zedekiah came
[7:39] jus had shut him up saying were formed
[7:41] us stop prophesied and say thus saith
[7:44] the lord behold i will give this city
[7:46] into the hand of the king of babylon and
[7:48] he shall take it as Eric I king of Judah
[7:51] shall not escape out of the hand of the
[7:53] convenience but shall surely be
[7:55] delivered into the hand of the king of
[7:56] Babylon that shall speak with him mouth
[7:59] to mouth and his eyes shall behold his
[8:02] eyes and he shall leave Zedekiah to
[8:05] Babylon and there shall he be until I
[8:07] visit him say it the Lord though you
[8:09] fight with the cow because he shall not
[8:11] prosper Jeremiah said the word of the
[8:14] lord came unto me saying behold had a
[8:17] meal the son of showing thine huncle
[8:19] shall come unto thee say by be my field
[8:21] that is an Anna thought for the right of
[8:24] redemption is dying to buy it so let's
[8:29] pause right there and go back to it when
[8:31] the children of Israel came out of Egypt
[8:33] they crossed the Jordan River and the
[8:36] aryan to the land of promise where
[8:38] Joshua began to appoint he divided begin
[8:42] to divide up the land this tribe is
[8:43] going to go here this tribe is going to
[8:45] go here and then further on down they
[8:48] divided it by loss they had a little
[8:50] process whereby to your take lots and
[8:52] whatever the lot fell on than that
[8:54] family would get that little piece of
[8:55] land so you know Joshua types the Holy
[8:59] Spirit so Joshua the Holy Spirit is
[9:01] given everybody their inheritance their
[9:03] possession and when you got that land
[9:05] you can look down on that land and maybe
[9:08] like in the old westerns and stuff they
[9:09] run your fingers to it this is my
[9:11] inheritance this is mine and my children
[9:14] are going to have part of this
[9:16] inheritance and you know take take that
[9:18] inheritance and I think a little bit
[9:20] spiritual it out for a second take your
[9:22] inheritance not just laying not land but
[9:26] it's a person your inheritance is the
[9:29] person of Jesus Christ and you have a
[9:31] part of that inheritance with him that
[9:33] you can look and see it that if you have
[9:36] that inheritance you know the way we are
[9:39] going to explain it he said you can look
[9:41] and you can say my children
[9:44] going to be part of this inheritance
[9:46] homo second if you can have that
[9:52] inheritance you know like they can look
[9:54] down on that land and say this is this
[9:56] is what God has promised from me go
[9:58] ahead and you can look at it you can
[10:01] look at God's Word to say everything
[10:04] that God has promised is mine I'm trying
[10:10] not to get bush so that land that land
[10:18] was special to them those it was it amid
[10:21] everything to them because it meant that
[10:24] they were part of God people it would
[10:26] part of his plan they were part of part
[10:28] of the whole a whole reason they
[10:30] wouldn't journey through wilderness and
[10:32] came out of Egypt everything was to get
[10:34] into that promised land to get to get
[10:37] into that to get into that was that was
[10:40] the finished work they complete her work
[10:43] and you know there's so many of those
[10:45] little stories like everyone Joshua were
[10:47] they what I always did if you go back
[10:49] and read through josho that was it uh
[10:51] and you might have heard these stories
[10:53] before that it was seven tribes I think
[10:56] they everybody else had gotten their
[10:57] land but they didn't so they they went
[10:59] through the land and they put they
[11:01] observe the land and they wrote it down
[11:03] in the seven-part book that sense for me
[11:05] and when they went back they you know
[11:08] that Joshua inheritance was given out
[11:11] and they they got their inheritance from
[11:14] what was written in that seven-part book
[11:16] but I think about this now one of those
[11:21] cities that was given out was an atop
[11:24] was this little city that's in dispute
[11:26] here that they had a meal at an owns
[11:29] this little fielding and look they can
[11:34] see that the Babylonian army at the gate
[11:36] an ax toss was maybe three miles outside
[11:38] of the cities of Jerusalem's it was
[11:40] right there they can the Babylonian army
[11:43] is there and hamel's he's looking around
[11:45] he you know this
[11:46] bad economic situation their economy is
[11:49] doing poorly and he's probably running
[11:52] low on funds and whatnot so he said I
[11:54] won't I i I'm going to lose my land I
[11:58] want to keep it in the family and the
[12:01] Babylonian army might come in and take
[12:03] it over and then right at the doorstep
[12:06] it's but I want to I want to keep my
[12:09] land now no no how did how did they lose
[12:13] their inheritance how did the we just
[12:17] can't talk through that they lost their
[12:19] inheritance they lost the right to him
[12:22] they lost the right to live on that plan
[12:25] and to stay there and got carried away
[12:27] in the captivity because they disobeyed
[12:29] God word how did how did we lose our
[12:32] right to how did Avenue bring forth the
[12:36] right to bring forth at that book the
[12:38] right to the what was originally written
[12:42] in God because they disobeyed God word
[12:45] one word off but you know you need
[12:49] that's why we need a redeemer somebody
[12:51] to come and take back what God has
[12:54] already given us and what was written in
[12:58] God before the foundation of the world
[12:59] so you think a little bit spiritual as
[13:03] well as a reading through this because
[13:05] from a natural I this story makes no
[13:08] sense it makes no sense for Jeremiah to
[13:12] want to buy the land when the Babylonian
[13:15] army was on the doorstep it made no
[13:17] economic sense I was listening to a
[13:19] little a little lesson that bill at all
[13:21] or even some he was speaking at a church
[13:24] and all the little kids were asking him
[13:26] questions and one of the things he said
[13:27] was as he was growing up brother Brandon
[13:29] would do things and say things and he
[13:31] would think that makes no sense at all
[13:33] and how in the world is that going to
[13:36] work out it makes no sense but you know
[13:39] God's ways are so far higher than I were
[13:41] like little puny ass to be able to even
[13:44] begin to comprehend him how can we
[13:46] comprehend God's infinite ways in his
[13:49] mind but you know what
[13:51] when God spoken and prophet said it and
[13:53] it's everything just begins to work out
[13:56] exactly the way they should maybe when
[13:59] you read some of these Old Testament
[14:01] stories it almost you can almost see the
[14:04] exact same thing kind of paint it out
[14:07] like as well as I've been kind of
[14:09] studying books Daniel seven weeks along
[14:11] brother late in my own private time you
[14:13] can see how that the world looks at day
[14:15] 30 weeks is like so many people call the
[14:18] Book of Daniel is like this big favor
[14:20] that's just written because because you
[14:22] know there's so many questions that
[14:24] aren't are difficult to solve if I just
[14:28] like looking at the natural timeline and
[14:30] whatnot gotta have a revelation what
[14:34] would we do without a prophet to come
[14:36] and tell us exactly the dates and
[14:38] exactly times an exact when everything
[14:40] went and exactly how everything's going
[14:42] to pan out so we do exactly what we know
[14:45] if we know god's mind it that it's so
[14:49] beautiful all right now let's get back
[14:52] on track in beholding hannah middle the
[14:54] son of showing uncle shall come into the
[14:56] same body my field that is an aunt atop
[14:59] the right of redemption is dying to buy
[15:02] it so Hannibal my uncle's son came to me
[15:05] in the corner of prison according to
[15:06] world over and said unto me by my field
[15:10] I prayed it as an inner thought which is
[15:13] in the country of Benjamin for the right
[15:16] of inheritance is dying and the
[15:18] redemption is died buy it for thyself
[15:26] then I need that this was the word of
[15:30] the Lord I think about tea by jeremih
[15:35] sitting there and he had a vision from
[15:37] the Lord this is going to happen and
[15:38] then it happened and you know we're
[15:42] walking in a vision right now because
[15:44] you can see the the things that were
[15:46] spoken of in Daniel the things that were
[15:48] spoken of and all all through Scripture
[15:50] are being fulfilled right now right now
[15:52] side and I take you out what I've been
[15:57] looking through day I'm saying the weeks
[15:58] it really does that you could give you
[16:00] chills and make you just to realize that
[16:03] our that we're living in and to see the
[16:06] things I just want encourage everybody
[16:11] to keep up to go back and brother way
[16:13] he's going through this and go back and
[16:15] reread it and reread it until it comes
[16:17] alive to you cuz Oh what will get in
[16:20] something here just said I know by my
[16:24] field I pray that as an inner thoughts
[16:25] which is in the country before arriving
[16:27] here just as down and redemption is
[16:29] dying by for thyself then I knew that
[16:32] this was the word of the Lord and i
[16:34] bought the field of hannah me on my
[16:35] uncle's son there was an inner thoughts
[16:38] and waiting the money even 17 she cools
[16:41] of silver and I subscribe the evidence
[16:44] and sealed it and took witnesses and
[16:46] wagon the money in the balances now now
[16:49] that's Paul right there see how what
[16:52] great care in Jeremiah took to make sure
[16:55] that the debt was paid exactly there was
[16:59] nothing left out that the debt was paid
[17:01] that you could
[17:03] if you went back and looked at the
[17:04] evidence there would be no reason for
[17:06] anybody to say that there was a piece of
[17:09] the dead that was left unpaid it was
[17:12] totally paid then go over to a new
[17:15] testament look how Jesus standing on the
[17:17] on the on the banks of river Jordan easy
[17:19] telling John that we must I must fulfill
[17:21] all righteousness every job and every
[17:24] tittle has to be done so the debt is
[17:27] completely paid and program said to pay
[17:30] I was reading last night he said to pay
[17:32] the debt life had to be paying for death
[17:36] so Jesus on the cross back here there's
[17:39] that number again 17 17 she calls that
[17:43] we stayed on a while back so look at
[17:46] Jesus on the cross think extinguish
[17:48] spiritual eyes he's on the cross and
[17:50] he's he's doling out the price he's
[17:53] paying the price clinking and into the
[17:55] into the balance and you know go back in
[17:59] the Old Testament bill she's all that
[18:00] hand wrote on the wall your way to the
[18:02] balance and found wanting but here Jesus
[18:05] was paying all the price so that the
[18:07] whole price is made it out and pay
[18:09] there's nothing left and see what what
[18:13] care Jeremiah took the pay all the price
[18:15] and what care Jesus took because he came
[18:18] down God came down himself to hang on
[18:21] the cross and died and pay the price and
[18:24] put the illness the evidence was in an
[18:27] earthen vessel was it his own life don't
[18:30] come jumping over here that's what
[18:32] everything i bought the field a
[18:34] handwheel my uncle's son that was in
[18:35] inter Todd and waiting the money even 17
[18:38] chicos of silver and I subscribe the
[18:41] evidence who wrote it all down and
[18:44] sealed it and took witnesses there Jesus
[18:48] hanging on the cross everybody could see
[18:50] what the prices we had been paid and
[18:53] weighed him the money and the balances
[18:56] so I took the evidence of the purchase
[18:57] both that which was sealed according to
[19:00] the law and custom and that
[19:03] which was open now let's pause for a
[19:09] second when you got up when you're
[19:11] purchasing the land where you got you
[19:13] know brother Brandon broken down into
[19:14] three different things there's a title
[19:16] and abstract and addie the title says
[19:19] you got on the right to this land the
[19:22] deed gives it to somebody so if I'm
[19:25] purchasing it from somebody this person
[19:27] gives me a deep and that says now that's
[19:31] the document that said the title has
[19:32] been transferred to you and the abstract
[19:35] is what you can go all the way back up
[19:37] again because what if somebody gives you
[19:39] a title and and but there's an issue
[19:43] with their like a couple of couple of
[19:45] owners ago some there was an issue with
[19:48] it that later they could come back maybe
[19:50] and say well oops you don't really own
[19:53] the land because of this this problem
[19:55] whatever so abstract traces it all the
[19:57] way back all the way back to and
[20:01] verifies that it's really yours there
[20:05] ain't nobody can come in and say oops
[20:07] found out there's a problem with it now
[20:10] now how did he explain that with a new
[20:11] birth with a new birth you can look in
[20:13] the Bible and say well I believe like
[20:18] you can read in the Bible all these
[20:21] promises of what not you can say well
[20:23] I've got it I've got it now well that's
[20:26] your title when you gotta have an
[20:28] abstract it traces it all the way back
[20:31] to eternal life now that's what that's
[20:34] what element that's the evidence that
[20:36] Jeremiah had to put in that earlier
[20:39] vessel not just the Hannibal on the land
[20:42] and he passed it up at Jeremiah but he
[20:45] had to write down all the way back to
[20:49] Joshua when Josh was doling out the land
[20:53] all the way back so you can trace it
[20:55] let's see what Burnham said I there I
[20:56] found quote
[20:58] ok I can find it I got so many quotes
[21:08] in the water second
[21:23] ah
[21:26] with this real feelings maybe i'll get
[21:28] to in a second when the Spirit of God
[21:30] comes upon you and you truly are one of
[21:32] God's attributes that he's spoken of now
[21:35] if you're not you're wondering flush
[21:37] straight and run here there and
[21:38] everything else and never come to the
[21:39] knowledge of the truth if you are one of
[21:41] those that all things pass away right
[21:43] quick see and you become new and the
[21:45] plan of salvation is finished you're
[21:47] ready to obey every word of God they
[21:50] were that God ever spoken to you see for
[21:52] you to do your submissive to his word
[21:54] the contract exactly the abstract to the
[21:59] contract the title key belongs to you
[22:02] the debts are all paid it's all struck
[22:06] off and as it was at the day of
[22:08] Pentecost it's all the little doubts
[22:11] although the problems they might have
[22:12] been there if you've got the abstract or
[22:14] struck off because it goes all the way
[22:17] back to the original I hope I hope
[22:19] that's not born anybody sometimes I get
[22:22] when I do this little bobble straight
[22:23] for my family my wife says you putting
[22:26] the kids to sleep now now look at
[22:35] Revelation chapter 5 over and said now
[22:36] when Jeremiah wrote this book was sealed
[22:38] here's a good thing i want you to notice
[22:40] all of you to read it did that MC look
[22:42] now remember he was going to be gone he
[22:44] had prophesied now he didn't know it
[22:46] only who prophesy are you following me
[22:48] from prophecy new through the revelation
[22:50] of God that there was going to be away
[22:52] from that country for 70 years you
[22:53] remember him promise on that he would be
[22:55] 70 years they've been in captivity so he
[22:58] wanted to be sure that this seal that
[23:00] his inheritance will be kept because he
[23:02] had inherited his colors inheritance so
[23:05] he had it all rode up legally and what
[23:08] did he do with it so when rock a rust he
[23:11] put it in an earthly vessel and put it
[23:13] away so it wouldn't rot a rust until
[23:16] them 70 years was expired
[23:20] oh here here's that cordless phone
[23:23] praise Allah Revelation chapter 5 how
[23:26] many ever read it all right you ready
[23:27] ready then all right now he took and
[23:30] sealed it just exactly the way these
[23:32] Scrolls will seal here it's the most
[23:34] beautiful outstanding thing that you
[23:36] ever seen now I'm going to try to
[23:38] illustrate it with this piece of paper I
[23:40] don't know what I can here's the way it
[23:43] was written up like this now you've done
[23:44] it and you seal it like this he's down
[23:46] now what happened I want to each one of
[23:49] those seals rotor out of here his
[23:51] inheritance and what taking place and
[23:55] all the ones that fail before him and
[23:59] how young to inherit it was all sealed
[24:04] like that now that's that's a little
[24:07] natural story that he ever taken trace
[24:11] it all the way back to originally how he
[24:14] got it now Thank spiritually when you
[24:17] get the new birth the abstract titled
[24:21] eat it of the new birth experience in
[24:24] your soul can be traced back all but not
[24:26] traced back because it's not like
[24:28] there's previous owners and those
[24:30] different things like that but it's the
[24:32] proof that the original life is now that
[24:37] you're part of the original life and
[24:39] there's nothing in between my brother
[24:41] animals he said he's talking about he
[24:43] said just a few minutes ago I prayed for
[24:45] this little epileptic girl that had
[24:48] absolute epilepsy because in her natural
[24:50] genealogy her grandma she said he said
[24:53] he got it came from her grandparents so
[24:56] he said the abstract can wipe all that
[25:00] away because the abstract title deed
[25:04] gives you the right hmm
[25:10] it gives you the right to the land and
[25:13] then that the devil ain't got no hold on
[25:16] me the Devil cake come and say well what
[25:19] about this because the abstract can be
[25:22] traced all the way back to God's eternal
[25:25] life where you written in him before the
[25:27] foundation of the world and the way that
[25:30] God had to get that down to us was he
[25:33] had to put it in an earthen vessels so
[25:37] that it would last a long time it's
[25:40] gotta be in an earthen vessel so that it
[25:43] will last so first he came and put it in
[25:46] his earthen vessel I'm trying to line up
[25:48] here because of running out of time and
[25:52] then like Paul said in second
[25:57] Corinthians 47 we have this treasure in
[26:01] earthen vessels that the excellency of
[26:05] the power may be of God and not of us
[26:09] maybe you can take that much scripture
[26:11] and wreck it down so much look at that
[26:14] insulin say the power maybe Oh God go
[26:17] all the way back to when God began
[26:20] instituting this right of redemption and
[26:23] the land and whatever it what if what he
[26:25] told it always he said the laminating
[26:27] ain't even yours is mine and I'm letting
[26:30] you I'm letting you use it it's it's God
[26:33] working in us it's not us it's not us
[26:37] doing something but it's God being made
[26:41] manifest and so oh goodness I got two
[26:45] minutes I'm a rapper than just a second
[26:48] so I took the evidence of the purchase
[26:50] both that which was sealed according to
[26:52] the law and custom in that which was
[26:54] open and I i just got a second time i'm
[26:59] gonna skip over that real quick but now
[27:01] look you can look at that you know
[27:03] program TV he was bringing their
[27:05] scripture out when he's talking about
[27:07] the seals when there's going to be
[27:10] sealed the seal means a finished work so
[27:14] he sealed up the illness so and put it
[27:17] in an earthen vessel so when you ask a
[27:18] long time when they came out of
[27:20] captivity they can read that oakland the
[27:22] open pieces say well this land belongs
[27:25] to jeremiah you can read this book and
[27:28] see well this this I got them I got the
[27:31] ride or whatever but there's got to be
[27:32] and something something something
[27:34] revealed to you something sealed a
[27:37] private piece this that there's an open
[27:40] and a private piece there's an open best
[27:43] visible to the world and a piece that's
[27:45] just visible to you reveal to you and
[27:47] your secret chamber this up there like
[27:50] like they all he got down and he began
[27:52] to read about Jeremiah said we're gonna
[27:54] be down first forget for 70 years and he
[27:56] got down on his knees and the angel
[27:58] Gabriel came and said well this ain't
[28:01] all us about it's not just about 70
[28:04] years in captivity but i'm going to show
[28:06] you all the way up to the consummation
[28:07] and i'm going to tell you about God 64
[28:10] purpose and about how that this evidence
[28:13] that sealed within this earthen vessels
[28:15] got to last all the way until 144,000
[28:18] get the same message that the Gentiles
[28:20] do and I'll stop right there are two
[28:23] next year
