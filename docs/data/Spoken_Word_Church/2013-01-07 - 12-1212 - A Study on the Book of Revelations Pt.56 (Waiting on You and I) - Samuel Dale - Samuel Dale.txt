========================================

yes open the eyes my amen i want to see you i am in the light of your glory pour out your power is good to see everybody in the house of the lord you like turning your scriptures turning back to where we've been reading in revelations one but then we'll go to revelations one will go to ephesians one see revelation one that ephesians 1. my wife and i want to thank everybody for all of the the gifts

healer a deliverer of all in all and jesus is your name thank you for everything father and just have your way now as we read your words you come and speak to us that we may lord deliver to the people what's upon our hearts god is now in jesus name amen revelations 1. one through three that we've been at it for a while it says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pies and he said and signified it by his angel and to his servant john and by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy we're a blessed people right and keep those things which are written they're in for the time is at hand the time to understand is now upon us okay ephesians 1 let's start reading verse 2 grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blind before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace when he hath made us accepted in the blood that's right in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will what to adopt us to put us into a place bring it to an end here in the end time according to his uh his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time we might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him now notice evidently there's something not completed when paul is saying this right yep now there's evidently something not completed because paul is looking forward to a dispensation a time right this is the dispensation of redemption right the finishing of all things so now paul was looking to that prophesying see that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth look how far the redemption brother brown says goes all the way into heaven even in him and also we have obtained an inheritance see now here we see drop back to us us then us now all right and also we obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory he first trusted in christ in whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance what now until somewhere later not there which is the earnest that's the new birth but there's something to come until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory and be seated that is blessing lord add it to the world all right now he's talking about a purchased possession right you know it's finished but it's not made manifest yet right all right now that's kind of what we'll we'll talk about a little bit tonight we get time but and we will try to get to our point but i said we'd have questions and comments tonight and uh i just want to lay down a little bit and and make sure you follow me it's kind of like i was referring to the brothers that when we were in the meeting just recently about the daniel 70 weeks i said now at least if y'all are going to come together to not talk about the situation daniel and and argue about what we said at least you ought to go listen to the tape right you know right you to what we've already said you know and not just come out and present what you believe but you know you're going to discuss it so if we're going to discuss redemption then it's very vital to uh clarify establish uh set in order what we think about and then we can talk about redemption and just like i was reading there from paul in ephesians he's going from present tense of himself right to future tense to you and i right us then he's going on to show that the purchase has already been made but it has not been applied that's right all right redemption was done at calvary amen he's not to have to come back in the end time and when i get to that in a minute don't have no reference in your mind to think that we're saying that he has to come back in the end time and do something it's already finished all right but everything wasn't uh made up or applied to mankind brother and said he paid the price for the jews and their salvation but he said because of their rejection it was not applied in their day all right so then it would have to be a time to apply right well see then that's what we've been trying to talk about is understanding you know that what part of the book and where we're at and what we're sewing for and and the salvation of all mankind because according to to romans 6 and 10 it says jesus died unto sin once amen he never died a dozen times all right he died under sin once right that all might be able to live see and he paid the price there of a eternal redemption amen for everything that's right in him was it was finished he even went to hell paid that price he prayed our price for us right he even brings forth and and and comes to a resurrection to show that there will be a people in the end time that will be raised he comes to a change you know he goes for mortal immortality and the whole thing is in a redemptive form already paid for but it would be like me telling you you know and i'd say not now brother marlow i know he likes him suits and everything and then our store we're used to working and i paid for you a suit well i got a new suit let me go tell everybody i got a new suit six months later i got a new suit and something wrong right i want to see you soon right but you see he didn't understand me i said it's paid for but he had to go get him right right so there's parts about this redemptive plan that was not made manifest back there that's right it's waiting until the end time that's right and thanks even to the redemption of the world see because his blood dropped on the earth to cleanse and claim it but it's in a process just like we are we're in a process peter says being born again but how well what do you mean i just born again and then you know maybe later i'll do this or maybe let no peter says it's by the incorruptible word of god right all right so everybody is not being born again that's right amen right now this is what i'm saying then ever so-called christian is not being born again if they don't have someone to teach them the fundament of the gospel right you understand not sitting there lost just saying they're not progressing forward they're not going on the bible says to go on to know the lord which means you don't know the lord all at once right you go on to know the lord all right now we talk about the scripture but do we really understand that jesus said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free now if that's right according to the english language he's making a statement about the truth but his point is you shall know the truth but everybody doesn't know the truth right amen right right i mean now come on you're in a trinitarian thought or concept you're not in the truth i don't care how much letter of the word you can quote to me how much you can memorize it you're not in the truth jesus said i am the truth right amen well if we're not in the revealed word of the hour right that's it now are you listening then we can't claim to be knowing truth that's right like i've always tried to tell you it's not to know about truth right that's what people want to do they want to know about truth and they call that truth you know i mean you go ask a trinitarian is he is he in the truth he'll tell you to hurry i mean the truth you say well what about jesus saying i am the truth right yeah jesus is the truth i believe him no he said i am that i am is the same word that he spoke to the little one that said we believe the messiah is coming he said the one that's speaking to you that's me i am see if you're not into truth how can you say that you're serving god that's right i'm not saying saying that you're not serving some god or a form or a thought but then you'd have to admit that the biggest portion of the world is not serving the true god amen agree now those it hasn't hurt that's what we've done sunday and i want to read every how you say it i want to say over again a little bit to make sure you follow me see god understands right right yep and that's our problem we say god knows my heart well if he didn't know my heart i might be all right but that's the problem now you and i can't say it we can't say that god will wink at her ignorance and brother dale do we have to know everything no but how could you have salvation now i'm asking this seriously question to you how can you have salvation believing in buddha as a god yeah right come on now i mean is there any salvation in that right is there any salvation in believing of any god other than the one true and living god right amen all right and we'll get back to that in a minute because that's what i was trying to say sunday and i i just had to drop my thoughts and leave it those people i covered the the groups of people and then all of those groups of people all of them were related or connected to the worship of that one true god amen whether it would be jehovah the old testament you know or jesus or the new or whatever you want to call it and i had no reference to anyone outside of those that had worship of that god not a god or some god right go if it's not the truth what's the difference right if you're not going to believe truth what's the difference right you can call him buddha hindu whatever who did who did he watch you know right joe jim charlie or anything because it'd be the same god you'd be talking about because it's not but one true and living god right now in his name is jesus christ that name was not used in the old testament it was jehovah yahweh elohim different forms were used to express that god but now there's no salvation there's no uh god winking at ignorance of people that are taught wrong and worshiping buddha i know that requires you to think a little bit see there's no salvation in any other god amen that's right there's no salvation in any form of those things he said but those are honest people good sincere yeah but now that's my emphasis that was what i was trying to get out sunday that you don't have salvation in any other form god thoughts ideas or anything that are not related to the one true and living god all right amen you said but what about my family well that's right what about you right that's right right it's not about your family because right there's they're standing between them and god right that's right but you see god did wink at ignorance but now i'm i'm going to try to make it as great as good as i can do that even while we were believing in the trinity we were still trying to relate our thoughts within the form of that one god right right whether we believed in god in three persons or whatever you know and that's why your foolish virgins can come up at the white throne judgment and receive eternal life that they have a confession right but not a possession right but you don't qualify for a food foolish virgin to be a muslim or hindu whatever right now i covered that so that was in the message they can be good to you or good to somebody right and that's why it's based upon a cup of water in my name it's not based upon the cup of water in buddha's name right right now right man are you listening it's a cup of water in my name right right a foolish version will only apply then to a person who would have some relationship or form to those of the true god that's right maybe you want to write your questions you might have some on these but i try to make it as plain as i can because i realize that i'm talking to people that maybe did not connect onto the first service and hear us you know i'm trying not to leave it such of a vast gap until there wouldn't be any understanding you see there's no salvation in worshiping any or any connecting a form of salvation connected to any other god outside of the one true and living god all right because there is no other god now are you listening i said a foolish virgin could qualify for a cup of water in my name but that's still related to jesus christ are you listening they would still be related into the form of the true worship it would not be just being good to a buddha or another hindu you know that would be a foolish version right amen i know these are plain statements that maybe you've never considered but i've done a lot of them sunday that i hope you listen to that type over and over and over and anybody didn't hear it i wish you would as i said while ago people make statements and just lambast you about some when never hearing the the what you saying right i don't believe him don't believe what you don't even know what i play yeah go back and listen and then say i don't believe it right then you got you're in good shape with god or you're in bad shape so it's left up to you but listen church do you understand what i'm saying i place base everything sunday upon the everybody that would ever have any form of salvation whether it be bride foolish virgins uh physical jew 144 thousand two witnesses uh whatever you know that it would still have to be related to their belief their faith their connection their their life is dependent upon them in that form of worship of the true god because there's no worship outside of that sure jesus christ died for all yeah but if you won't believe in him right that's why i thank god that this prophet could tell us some things that we didn't know right amen that's right about the truth of redemption now we're not talking about everyone in the world to be saved i remember about years ago a man preached a message in this message he called it the place for everybody well there there is a place for everybody but i wouldn't want to go to one of those places that's going to be a lot go-to right i want to be in a redemptive place don't you all right now listen then then to know the truth not know about truth but to know the truth that that truth could say i am are you following me right that the truth that you could follow could say i am but jesus said i am all right i'm the way the truth right right so if you want to know truth where do you go to where's nominee no you have to go to the bible and to go see what god said and the plan and way that he made for all of us to be redeemed but remember all could have received it but all will not receive it and then thereby he'll be able to judge them because they'll have some form of uh connection but johnny and i were talking about it yesterday so you think about that jesus went and preached to the spirits in our souls in prison but now it specifies who they were right now i i don't have time always to explain something but i try see he never went to preach to the souls that were in prison in the days of abraham right that's right the days of of uh ezekiel or isaiah he specifically stated who he went to was to those in the days of noah which meant goes from genesis 1 you know the creation up to the first 2 000 years because that's where noah came into existence and the world was cleansed those people had only um partial yet it was a world as populated as this world because ecclesiastes says there's nothing new under the sun the prophet said that this there's people that are just like people today right but see jesus had to go there to speak to those that were back before the beginning of abraham and the prophetic laws and the prophets coming into being because those people only had enoch uh they would have had coming down to noah they had like we were talking about like seth uh you know a few connections that they would have had to you know have been connected there's no listing of any prophets right right you know from from genesis right in coming to the flood so jesus had to go preach to him right but there was no redemption for him right that's correct because that they rejected and they went wrong on what little bit they didn't know right that's right and we're condemned our bible that's why when brother random will cover the countdowns of different messages then it goes to paradise you'll always begin with abraham and what's that because then we like we covered sunday that the paradise of the old testament could be called the bosom of abraham amen right right see because then there begins the prophets the the the word being more uh brought out into the open as a condemnation whereas from genesis one to i say that you know go to mankind i think right but run said when he went there he said he told them i am the seed of the woman right that was genesis 3 16 verse 15 right because he had to go there because there was no prophetic utterance to condemn right that's right all right you see i don't have time to explain everything i i try to preach and everybody thinks i drag my legs out you know well he's been on this for three months on one thing i'd say six months right there in genesis 1. and never get out of it you ought to know that but see i was trying to lay down something someday and the main thing was that no matter where mankind is and showing this like that that jesus had to go to that group of people he couldn't leave him without a a condemnation right right or a witness we call it that's a better way i guess that's right a witness you had to witness to them that he was the seat of the woman right and the dead turned that down and you think about it seven billion people in the world today how many was in the world before the flood everybody that's right ah they were just 14 or 12 of them maybe 10 of them that's what we think about we don't think about a large group right we're really struck and i'll get back to it in a minute then we'll run around and say that heather to be raised up in the millennium is it going to be 14 of them 12 of them their hammond is going to be there all that are supposed to be there that's right which could be millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of trillions they've never heard the gospel god's great god amen whether you think about it or not i'm trying to show to you god's great god that's right that he would think about those people he doesn't judge anybody without first giving a witness correct amen you're following me all right so he had to be a witness right to those that were in hell or whatever the word would be used for the place of abode of those from genesis up to noah right he's a great god amen that's right and he considers everything he considers whether you've heard of him or not that's right considers whether you've heard the truth about what you've heard of him he's a wonderful god amen we're not talking about some petty pattern you know that's running down we don't know where they were going to be where where's the scriptures gonna be brother ryan said it one day i'll find it and read it to you but he said it amen now if you're gonna believe it was a prophet okay if not go on to john right a lot of things brought around and said it takes a while before you find the scripture but you know what you'll always find it that's right you'll just keep searching all right now think about what i'm saying only those who are connected whatever the word's using to a redemptive form it would only be those connected or related to the true and living god that's why jesus died once for all amen all right amen and the scripture actually you know you look it up and say well well the bible don't say jesus died once foreign all right we use brother branham a lot of times when what he's saying is correct but the scripture is a little different wording right of your understanding that's why when we were back there in the talking of the the tribes over in the book of revelations the brother branham will state he said in revelation 7 dan and ephraim is missing he said and joseph and levi is put in but then you go to read revelation 7 you finally it doesn't mention ephraim it only mentions dan and i've tried for all of ever since i've been in this message it's about it to get people to believe that there was originally supposed to be in 13 tribes and you don't never hear anybody talk about that right is it because they don't understand i talk about what i understand i don't know what you talk about but without having it the way the prophet put it together but when you do see it there was a 13 tribe amen yes sir that ibrahim and manasseh was placed in to the 12 sons of jacob making it 13 pull joseph out put him over because the tribe was never the prophet said to be named after him but it was because of the fallen what man done but then when you do dan and ephraim is missing out of the book of revelation 17 that seventh chapter why because it was supposed to been 13 tribes right right i love it like that i love it when i stand behind what he says and they'll just all tie together maybe that's why we don't get so many comments about what we preach i guess but maybe it's hard to argue with an old dude like me whatever i am but now i want to review just a little bit because we've already been doing a lot now uh we covered the groups of people that would be involved in redemption and we we showed that they would have an out of and in two form to their salvation and that their belief in god their uh you know thoughts of god the jehovah god now not talking about i said i keep saying it not talking about this hey god there's nothing i covered is any way related to belief in just any form of god it's all related even the foolish virgins would be related to a belief in a form of god being maybe god in three persons blessed trinity but still related back to to jesus christ so now we covered the old testament saints and in that covering i made some statements that you know i had never made before because i really didn't understand it before and maybe i don't know so just pray for me and you know just let it be that way but i said there's a the old testament saints that raised with the lord jesus i don't believe they raised in mortal bodies right you said when i run around and said so it's i know all the quotes right no problem well you're trying to correct him no no no i'm trying to state something of my own belief but the reason of that belief is the scripture says that no man of the preacher has approached amen they're in timothy no man has approached immortality it said jesus christ now you know if you can bring that and tie that into what you're talking about then all right that's okay i'll listen but i believe they raised in theophany form and they went to the sixth dimension right they went to paradise because paul was taken to paradise because paradise was taken up remember we covered that and paul said he went up to paradise well they must ever be a paradise which is not like the old testament paradise it would be changed to a form and connecting to the belief of jesus christ and what all of them spoke of you know right and see then that old testament saint they would go under the altar and i said it you go ahead because if you believe that they raved in mortal bodies then you don't have to raise them up to take them into the millennium right so if that's what you want to believe about it go ahead because my point was they're going to be in the millennium that's right not every old testament person right but the predestinated right the israel of god amen because israel is the name of redemption right right so those old testament signs the ones that raised with jesus they will one day step into the millennial run right and say well you can't prove that well you can't prove they won't we're sitting in a stalemate i guess i ain't worried about it because i'm going to argue with you i'm just going to state what the prophet says as much as i can the millennium will be israel as a nation that's only seven seal if you don't live nowhere else i've listened to it yesterday it's israel as a nation in the millennium a promise to david that's correct amen well is it only going to be 144 000 jews we've already proved it's got to be 144 000 plus twenty four thousand in the millennium so why not just lay down your thoughts and listen and pray for me see by them being taken up though irregardless of whether eternal immortal bodies or whether that's theophany regardless of the point i believe they'll be in the millennial reign right all right because they don't have to go to the white throne judgment they're already raised up they've already entered paradise anyone that would enter paradise would not have to go to the white throne right that's right i know that requires a little thinking but consider it so we dealt with that group of people all right and we saw that they could be in the millennium they build a temple and all like that because when we come back it's a honeymoon it's not a basis of working force for us and we come back there you know and they already have everything set up now in that millennial temple i'll say this before i consider it going to say anything else because the way people think you're talking about the millennium temple there is no uh sacrifice of animals right jesus christ is our sacrifice and he will be there to prove that they won't be offering animals just in case somebody's listening that's still maybe hasn't heard the truth are so carnal in their own concept there won't be any killing in the millennium will be in the offering of sacrifices right but you see what i'm saying that they would bypass or miss the lights on judgment and would be able to go to the millennial reign to be raised up any way you want to bring it i brought over as mortals eternal if that's the way you want to consider it to be then we went to the see that would be that form because that'd be the only one you can deal with we went to the 144 thousand and we dealt with them as the word brother branham said actually page 41 the church age book that that 144 000 would be in the millennial reign as servants to the bride amen so he gave the scriptures and the different things to to be able to be considered within that so if they go to the millennial reign i hope you listen to what i'm saying when that form of redemption is there that is taken part and then in the millennial reign they don't have to go to the white throne right because 144 thousand given eternal life right here that's right so what would they have to be judged for what's the old testament saints got to be judged for right if they're already in that place irregardless of whether you say mortal or not mortal it wouldn't make no difference to me because the same thing is going to be the end thereof all right but that 144 000 and it's the two witnesses they have eternal life here there is a record in the bible that the two witnesses will go off into rapture but there's no record in the bible that the 144 thousand go up in the rats right they are killed 144 the two innings that are raised up and then that's end up in the sixth rapture of the bible three and the old tree and the new right all right now then they don't have to go to the white room right amen they could be raised up and taken into the millennium see then you say well but i don't understand that raising up what are you gonna do where the prophet said that those heathering would be raised up paragraph 177 questioned the nature of 1962 he said they'd be a gospel because we'd have to have something we're going to rule and reign for a thousand years he said we're going to have something to rule over the rain over that's right he said they'll hear the gospel so the heathen can be raised up and taken into the millennium so you got things that could happen backing up into 144 000 you're dealing there in the book of revelation 7 with the 12 listing with danny from missing but in the millennium ezekiel 48 and we gave you all these quotes wrote around and said seventh seal ezekiel in the millennium in chapter 48 throw them back in perfect order which would mean 13 tribes that's right and he names them all right and so it would be the girl you're dealing with 24 000 is going to be raised up going to millenniums in some form or source or whatever so we're getting a point if you're understanding me we're getting a point of seeing that there's going to be good many people in the millennium that we can prove by the prophet right all right so then there's no argument in that 144 000 they missed the rightful judgment then we dealt with what would be called the fifth sealed you as paul was talking about that all this will be saved and we see according to the fifth seal there's going to be a vast number of jews that will be given eternal life white rose right and according to the scriptures they're giving it given unto them before on the fifth seal before the two witnesses and the 144 000 are killed right and they're told to wait a little while that's right and they can save can we go back now he says no these others got to be killed right so then fifth field you could wind up in the millennium because if they're given white robes this is prior to the muslim judgment they don't have to stand the white trump right they don't have to go to that micron judgment right it means a great thing that's right they can go into the millennial reign because they have nothing holding them the only groups of people that we dealt with was the foolish virgins and brother ryan said these foolish virgins comes out of every church age right amen and i went ahead and made a statement to it what i believe that there would be a form of foolish virgin in the old testament i used the word the way i mean it a form of or a top of right that would be good people but that's why i brought around said all that's why the bible stipulates that all didn't raise see there's going to be a general resurrection one day or the second resurrection that's right that they will have to be going to the white room so the foolish virgin will have to go to the white throne to be judged because she has no white robes while she's here or as the field shield you of any connection to a white robe right all right and as you do then those people will have to be judged well then i have no problem with bringing up all the old testament people that didn't go up when jesus went up bring them on up to the second resurrection as we'd call it and and bring them to the white throne and be judged all right but remember the key to one thing the millennial reign is to the jews that's right it's to the jews as a nation because it was promised to him right right now those foolish virgins don't get to go through the millennial reign they don't need to live through it right well because we're watching this later on right all right now then in the future home it's not listening as israel as a nation anywhere are you listening in the future home you're talking about the bride being in the city and being able to stay in the city and her attendance our servants would be allowed to stay where she is and we could go in and out but there's other people which would be known as nations that would come into the city bring in i don't understand what they mean but they bring in their offerings the bible says the prophet said it and they bring their offense they lay them down but they're gonna go back out of the city but as they go out of the city they do a marvelous thing they're capable of reaching over and taking a leaf off of the tree of life now i don't think taking the leak off means you're going to run out of leaves out of why i got my own thinking of that i believe when you pull the leave off the tree of life there's going to be another leaf on it i believe when you reach up and get a bunch of grapes you know to be able to eat one day that is not going to be a hole that you've got the grapes off of and what i love about it there ain't going to be no bathrooms in the future home because whatever you eat is going to be consumed in an eternal glorified body so it's going to be wonderful we don't understand what that could be but do you see what i'm talking about right then we tried to cover that the heather that would have the gospel preached to him in the millennium now i don't know how to deal with that i'm honest maybe one of these days the lord shall not talk to us more about it but until he does i don't understand it now if they have a gospel preached to them surely they must be in some way that they can help they can receive that gospel you know i mean you know why preach the gospel to somebody they can't receive it right so maybe they can receive that gospel you know that's going to be me and you is going to preach too because that's what the bible says we're ruling rain right now seeing those people then there will be some marvelous things take place as we see the plan of redemption for everything then we went on the end of the lights and just said a few words about that one day the world would receive a fiery baptism and the world would be made eternal and you'll come forth in the future home all right now we said and we taught it and i believe it that all of those in redemption as i started off with is related to whether or not jesus christ was almighty god amen you remember the prophet said it was dependent upon him to come down why because he said he would that's right to come down and die that we might have life and then he might be able to deal with all of these groups of people that we've named and deal with them in an honest form to where that he can bring the true ones to redemption so it's not just a fact of a bride is always going to be in heaven or a bride is always going to be in the millennium there's going to be a lot of people in the millennium because if you see what i was saying while ago when you bring them them 13 tribes back into the original form of ezekiel 48 in the millennial reign the levite's going to be in the middle and we're going to camp around just where it's supposed to be and you're going to have it beautiful as we draw it out from the prophet and he brought all the things that he told us and that way dan and ephraim can be put back in levi is taken out and put in the middle joseph is removed because joseph is the type of christ all right a beautiful plan amen that way you can deal with that twenty four thousand extra that i've always asked you how you're gonna deal with because the bible speaks of it the prophet speaks of it so you know well i never heard where he said 24 000 well just keep reading you'll find where he's talking about it you know but now listen all is dependent are based upon belief in the true god that's right right all redemption is based upon our beliefs and true god not in buddha hindu muslims i explained that a buddha could be good to a bride sure and receive eternal life as a white throne right virgin form but a buddha being good to a buddha i ain't gonna worry about him gonna be there right i'm not concerned about it i'm talking about the ones related to the worship of true god the one true and living god now i already asked for a raise of hands but i won't but i hope you raise it in your heart that no matter what you think about all that i've said about any of these groups of this or groups of them that all redemption is based upon whether or not jesus was almighty god or not amen i mean we should all have that as a what common ground or whatever point you want to call it not trying to find places or counts but we should all believe in the redemptive plan because jesus christ died for all the old testaments and whether it's the news right that's why he died under sin once yep all right so we paid those prices so the world was dependent upon or has always been salvation has always been dependent upon whether or not he was god all right that's right he said unless you believe that i am he right you'll die in your sins we believe you jesus it wasn't referring to just jesus that's right right he was saying unless you believe that i am he the jehovah of the old with jesus or the new now you've got it in correct order and you believe in it all right i told them jehovah witnesses one time the house ain't never been back i wonder about that but i told him i'm a greater jehovah witness than you are and young men how's that i said i'll leave jehovah the old jesus of the new man he wanted to talk the old man got him armed and let him off he didn't want to talk no more yeah maybe they put an x because i don't said something to them when they're out there i know you guys i know what y'all do so go ahead and put your eggs in there i said you put a little x by my house and you won't talk to me tomorrow i said go ahead put a little x out there but this won't make a difference but i'm going to argue with you i'm just going to tell you about jesus christ but now listen if you believe that all is based upon the truth and whether or not he is the truth it's all based upon him now right now do you realize the end that there's a lot dependent upon a group of people called the bride of christ that's right exactly right a lot is dependent upon that now not dependent upon the bases that the bride has any salvation to give in that way but she does have the ability to impart something right you want to study that quite a while brother and said if you want to do that said come on there's water out here said we'll get baptized man lord jesus christ he said it's not being you that's going to give out eternal life like highest as we give out to go to town use an army or something you know but there's a lot of dependents were left because now you agreed with me when i first started on the basis that even though salvation was paid for by jesus christ even though all was completed the world redemption everything but yet a lot of things didn't happen back there right right but jesus christ died that didn't save the world because the world didn't want it right right he paid the price for anybody that wanted it right but then the first coming of the holy ghost was on the basis now i hope you listen because on the basis of the promise of god right the day of pentecost was fully come that was not upon what any man had any connection i hope you understand now we know that the old and can connect it together but see that was the promise of god and you know those things brother random made statements that i love to think about he said god is not going to send the holy spirit the headstone on the merits of our us right he said he's going to send it because he promised it i love that i i like to take god and say now lord you promised it right amen i'm not dealing with trying to get a new car and say you promised to give it because he don't say he promised to give me a new car you know but when i find something in the word like the salvation of my family i circle that right i say that's you lord speaking to me amen says you'll be there with your offspring amen you mean your kid's going to be saved because brother dale your they're your children no grandkids or great grandkids no never have implied that right that's right but it's going to be based upon whether or not i can accept it right and then i can try my best to help you to see it and that way i can help impart it right and if my family believes it they're going to be there i don't care how bad you're living what you're doing go ahead you're going to find a bump in the road one day all right you're gonna find out you better turn around just don't make it too late because you can't override the free mortal agency of god just don't do that right just make sure that you understand you're not going to be saved because you're my children my grandchildren my great-grandchildren no no it's because that god promised me amen and if you'll take that same promise he'll save you all right that's right that's right no matter how bad you are what you are he'll save you if you believe it but it's based on what i've been saying the belief in the correct god well i'll just go down here to baptist church and join up with them brother today we'll go right ahead lord's going to get you anyway that's right right stop and talk to a man one day used to come to church here oh man he's so mad at me still to this day you want him hard to look at me i stopped drove over where he was walking around the pasture i got out walked up to him i said how you doing robert he said i'm doing pretty good i said when you gonna quit playing around what do you mean i said well the church has already prayed for you and we believe that you're coming so you just might as well pack up your duds and come on boy you talking about a man he used to have a bullet a german shepherd it was tough and that wasn't nothing compared to what i saw he wanted to break me into and he was capable he took a cocoa bottle broke glass cocoa bottle in the old days and break it slap him too he was that strong never seen a man with strength of that but he could do it he wanted to break my neck i just ran and said see you later robert got in the car and drove off i said i'll just come by and tell you that we waiting on you now he told donnie where i could go i guess that won't make no difference you see church this is not based upon fiction or right whatever it's based upon reality right he said well what if he don't come i don't have to worry about it what if he does come you have to worry about it we could go a lot on saying how that god has spoke to us here about people and a couple of them sitting here right now and i'm looking at one in this corner and one in that one and i just told joyce one day i said don't worry about it joyce danny's coming danny says well i wish you told me about that i couldn't do that no that's right i don't know why i told jim not to worry about wade he'd be there you see when he speaks to you then you're not dealing about a god of history right or another god or another form because those other gods can talk to you right that's right i hope you followed me get back to the thought we received the baptism of the holy ghost the bride of jesus christ while we're here on earth we've come up through as we've read there in ephesians to the adoption and we come to a place in that adoption until we even come to um romans 8 about 22-23 and it says the whole world and it's later on in message i'll get it here the whole world is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god amen that's right so jesus never completed his whole work while he was here right be nicely right there with it people would argue and say word that okay we just keep it vote for them have to worry about it we we just tell you where the prophet said it all right we'll get to that just a second because i want you to read with me go ahead and pull up hebrews 11. i want you to read hebrews 11. not the whole thing we will go through it we just read a little bit going over to verse 31 33 to verse 33. talking about the people of the old testament and the new right hebrews 11 about faith enoch offered them to god by faith noah by faith then come on down to the new testament right who through faith subdue kingdoms brought righteousness obtain promises stock the mouth of lines all right whence the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness we're made strong wax violet in fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens you can go in throughout the scripture to spend weeks right there right women receive their dead raised to life again and others were tortured once not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection because the one that was raised from the dead might have died later and went to hell true some didn't want to accept it that way so they wanted a better resurrection others had trial of cruel markings and scorching yet he moreover of bonds and imprisonment see going from old testament around me than you they were stoned they were sawed asunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wondered about his sheepskins and goat skins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts in the mountains and indians and caves of the earth what and these all haven't obtained a good report true faith received not the promise see they're still in the grave waiting right they're still in that form somewhere what do you want to call it waiting and what are they waiting on they're waiting on now don't misunderstand me so then i'll say it over and over they're waiting on jesus christ to fulfill the complete plan of redemption all right but now we've got to find out where jesus christ is at right amen get that faith and belief correct right because of the last verse having provided some better thing for us i'm glad they left it off until it come up thank you brother anderson that they without us should not be made perfectly amen perfect means complete a full age or in other words those are in the grave waiting on you and i to bring them out right they're waiting there to worry that they can come forth one day all right now let's just read some things that brother brown said because see jesus never completed everything right the dead hasn't been raised in the end time right now don't misunderstand me me at all it'll be him that raises the dead amen but it's where he's at that's right see when he came to the bride of jesus christ he had a plan not to just save the souls he paid the price for them but how would you bring up all of those old testament saints any words you put them 144 000 still sealed jew foolish virgins for the heathen now the gospel preached to him in the millennium how would you do that without first considering something is going to take place that there's got to be a bride and that's right who becomes the word by her and through her let's go ahead and read a little bit look at number three take them to the spoken words original seed 1963 62-318 now if you remember this statement is from it and then the next is the church age book is taken from work that he had the word of the lord came to him and he told him to write you know the things that happened all right notice what harmony jesus never did anything until sin of the father or the father showed him first harmony between god and christ see john 5 19 soul will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death first the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen then i got a great big hallelujah here is the secret the word is in the bride amen and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name what she has does say of the lord i didn't say she had it he did now if she has it what's the next statement then it's germatized we have just said the lord the bible said thus they have the lord you're healed the bible says thus saith the lord if you believe that you're saved but then it's got to be dramatized you know made alive all right now so the holy spirit waters it until it is grown and serves its purpose they do only his will amen i believe that no one can persuade them different they have thus have the lord or they keep still that's good they will do the works of god they will do the works of god what for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill so now he listening it's him in them it's not them right right it's him in them right to fulfill once as he did not complete in his day all things when he was here he did not complete them he when he was here for it was not time what is it that he didn't complete going up the next right now this is taken from page 172 of the church in the book that from her to me and age those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know what it they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his works while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride right she knows that but it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time what is that sounds like god having provided some better thing for us hebrews 11 40. the day without us should not be made perfect right god's waiting on you and i am yeah right amen look at the next one is the eagle surface nest 64 tree it's loud paragraph or takes 38 it's loud over time for the elect's sake and he's bringing it down right said it's past you like you know like it was in the day of noah wayfix but god's waiting to get his church in order he's waiting on you now may he correct your blessings you pray he's waiting on you and i that's right god's waiting on you and i right to the next one number seven whole creation groaning for we know that the whole creation growth and throat left in pain together until now why is it groaning something's wrong somebody not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we in ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the rejection of our body now how long have we been quickly on the word to it to understand the whole world has been waiting on somebody to be able to come to the place to be able to understand all right look at number seven what was the holy ghost given for 1959 paragraph 51 but now when we need it the spirit of god raises up a standard what is it he's pouring in his spirit then those who are resting out younger in the grave are under the altar of god as the scripture says are crying how long lord how long how much longer god's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when god can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church in christ becomes so close together your christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go in the rapture amen that's not a corporal coming right i'm trying to find one because i messed up trying to put it in but they're where the scripture says they're waiting to with the redemption of the body but around says if i don't have it in here he said the first resurrection is what they're waiting on right because in that first resurrection comes you and i right he said that's to take place at the first resurrection so if i don't get to that part you just hold on to it look at the next one number eight adoption part 3 1965-22 is that right waiting god trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this say there's my spirit flowing freely there it is that that i can work here get another one over here and place him i can place him adoption placing manifesting him out here and put a ceremony on him visiting with an angel tell him something now if he's told the truth now if he's just making up something it won't work no no that that won't work we have a lot of that but i mean i mean manifestation of the sons of god when god manifests himself and he sends himself out there and then he goes forth and what he says is truth what he does is the truth what he does he manifests christ how are you judging by the way he stays with the word how do you judge anybody but the way they stay with the work yes but he was so great at delivery ain't like you brother dale than having any cough drops to preach and then we get it done until he takes care of it watch how he stays with the word right with the word see that's how you know all men is by the way he stays with the word if they speak not according to the word there's no life in them says the bible say leave them away good point right go to the next one let me hurry up this is adoption part three this is program 163. you believe in dispensation big man in this message one time said he didn't believe in dispensation i'm sure like took him that quote but that's all right that's what he believes bible said so i'm in the dispensation of the fullness of time that's what the bible scripture said what is the fullness of time there's been a dispensation of this well there was a dispensation of the mosaic law there was a dispensation of john the baptist there was a dispensation of christ there's a disputation of church organization there is dispensation of the outpouring of the holy spirit now it's the discipline say now is the dispensation of adoption but the world's waiting groaning and when the fullness of time comes then the dispensation and the fullness of time what is that fullness of time when the dead rises when sickness seeks when all the earth ceases to grow the fullness of the dispensation of time watch this and when the dispensation flows down you might gather together in one all things in christ it's not without him folks aren't you glad how is he going to do it how's he going to do it getting together all things and who congregation says christ how do you get in christ by one spirit congenital sin right by one spirit we're all baptized into one body one body of that body is whose body christ already judged he took our judgment then what are we when i see the blood oh blood i'll pass over you every time he looks at the body there it is sitting there bloody i'm in there by how the holy ghost is passed over he's waiting on you and i the dispensation of adoption the dispensation of adoption okay a couple more what does it come down to be then here you him this is number 10. you know what happened when that boy became a certain age that boy was adopted into the family now how did they do they took them out of the public place put on a metro robo name and had a ceremony right we were in israel we saw bar mitzvah is that the way he gets that pretty close hey and all the people who sit together around and look and then they looked upon this boy and the father had a ceremony of adoption oh don't miss this after that son was adopted his name on the checkbook was just as good as it did theirs were god's trying to get his church right just stay to this mountain be moved and it'll move authority sons of god the whole creation groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god waiting to a spot where that this sickness will be arrived and it will be that way the blind will receive their sight what's wrong with eyes being opened now and helped him receive their sight death and done we pray for them now but then you will command it do say these sons shall follow them that believe but the house told me sunday said i'm going to tell the doctor when i get dark he can run his test if he wants to but i'm better right and everything's going to be all right well okay your doctor had to do it and he signed up for him that believed they shall pray for the sick he said they shall cast out devils not i will they will if you say to this mountain not if i say now the mountain ain't going to move if god ain't in here right speaking back out amen but it's connected to you and i to work that that's what he's waiting on sons and daughters need adoption amen okay this is the last one this one i'm hunting for a while ago the revelation of jesus christ uh revelation chapter five cuba part one paragraph 108 1961 6-11 we are waiting for the fullness of adoption this will take place when at the first resurrection that's when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we are and we'll have a body like his own glorious body where we shall see him as he is and we will be like him when he appears we appear in his likeness we will have a body like his a glorious glorified body all the trials and the struggles will fade away these earthly tabernacles listen folks everybody would amen down to when it says the sick will be healed cast out devils but you don't hear what's talked about than when these bodies are made new or eternal and how at the first resurrection the devil raised because you and i will call for it well brother dale i've been around now a long time i've heard a lot of people call for i'm glad you said it like that i've heard a lot of people call for it you've never heard jesus christ call for it and it didn't work that's right right right right right do you want to stay all night now to talk about a dead man laying a shot of a tractor one day that's right i roll back and i always said no i pray i do or this wait said daddy he's dead i never prayed for her never laid hands on him i just called his name i said randall he just raised his eyes looked around amen you stand up here like i did many many years ago and said i'm not kidding you god told me wade would be would come back to the lord you know a lot of people are actually offended because my son can one stand to be a preacher and one standing to be a deacon and all my kids could be in the church and their kids ain't you know they're upset at me on account of that you know they don't like to be around me why didn't they raise their kids that way that's right that's right we tried to raise ours right amen well i tried to but what did you do went to church every other month whether you needed to or not you know well what's your kids going to be and you know that hatred as in psalms today hatred breach hatred that's right man that's right right no love can bring you to the right place do you love your family amen yes brother dale i'd do anything in the world shut up if you don't take them to church you don't love them okay blood you don't take them to church and try to be before them a christian you don't love them that's right you got a feeling that's it that's right think about it the world's waiting on you and i folks somebody's going to believe this one day well i've heard that 40 years if we're around here next year you'll hear it again because it is the word amen but i'd hate to be sitting in a congregation where that my pastor couldn't explain things to me about certain things the prophet is taught i asked a sister one time i said what does your pastor say she went there for four years i know i said what does he teach on her soul she said i don't know ain't never heard him teach it three or four years that she'd been there didn't know what he believed about her soul not trying to get people to live try to get people to the world amen amen trying to get people to do what i've tried my best to explain tonight and i did sunday salvation redemption and all things is based upon a belief in one true and living god it's based upon whether or not he was god that's right what do you believe well i believe he was but do you believe he is amen and don't say he was i tried that's right he that cometh to god must believe that he yeah amen right right understand come on brother come here ain't got no time for questions so maybe you've got enough time to write them down by the weekend come back from sunday morning you just hand them to me my dependence is upon him i believe he'll tell us the right thing don't you what about it waiting on you and i all right let's joe click back the title and put it waiting on you and i instead of comments and questions we'll get them next time okay i'm glad these brothers can run that machines back there and be able to delete anything because we don't have time it's about three minutes till now but think about it waiting on you god left something for you to do to complete his plan the plan to redeem these bodies right he's laying in our hands he said well i just don't see you know anything in the word is left from me you need to come to lula let's sit down talk a little bit because everything in that whole book of revelation is left to be in you that's right you're coming forward to a change of our body at home to live and be what he wants us to be all right what do we got 97 97 anybody have any world will try to set his mind until you is is thank you is is thank you knew me is hello is oh jesus yesterday about from 11 to about one something was going on somewhere but i'm not a prophet so i can't able to tell you but i just know that somebody during that time was needing prayer or something help so i just stopped praying when i do then the nervousness goes away i believe all is well whatever it would be i don't know but it was during that period of time see because i believe that god can lay on our heart things he doesn't have to explain it right amen it's when you have a feeling just pray i don't know what to pray for we'll pray for everybody easy to do you see god is real that's right and i'm sorry reserve of god that's a real god when it can take care of a lot of things as far as we just let him right that's right amen we don't let him then it's all based upon whether or not you and i can yield ourselves to god he promised that they'd be a bride yes sir that would be so much of himself within her that she would call for the dead to raise that she would be the final voice under her messenger see he didn't finish it he left it for you and i haven't to finish the work that's right let's get on with it let's get on with it father we thank you we just ask you to go with us now as we go our separate ways going home take care of everybody give everybody a safe journey and we ask you to just lord let your love and manifestation be with each and every one of us we love you and we thank you unless the sick among us touch each one lord may your love be
