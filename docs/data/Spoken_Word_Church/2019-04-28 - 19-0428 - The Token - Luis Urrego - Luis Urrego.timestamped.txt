[0:15] what comes to your mind
[0:23] oh well we got but but that's what sinks
[0:33] that's that's uh it's just uh you know
[0:37] you're not going to be deceived about a
[0:39] Baptist in this day you're not gonna be
[0:42] deceived
[0:43] you're not going to be deceived by by by
[0:45] Pentecostal you remember brother bang
[0:48] talk about the two spirits in the
[0:50] framework of the church the two spirits
[0:55] almost alike so hard to to to to to
[1:00] differentiate but what was that what was
[1:02] the diff what mean the difference was
[1:03] the light the token right so the
[1:09] children of Israel they had to grab this
[1:11] blood from the lamb and place it on the
[1:14] doorpost right so it wasn't the lamb
[1:17] itself for the brand said was not the
[1:20] token the token was the blood right but
[1:25] really in actuality wasn't the blood it
[1:28] was the life the life because that blood
[1:31] you can have the blood all you want to
[1:33] as well you could have they could have
[1:35] had that blood all they want to but it's
[1:40] the life that had comes back upon the
[1:42] believer that changes who you see Jesus
[1:46] Christ rogram said Jesus Christ spilled
[1:49] all his blood spilled all the blood and
[1:50] there was only enough blood to just go
[1:52] for for a certain amount of people it
[1:55] wouldn't been able to cover everybody
[1:56] right in his physical element you see
[1:59] but that's the reason why I said one
[2:01] when go Terry II upon a day in the upper
[2:06] room
[2:06] that was the message go that was a
[2:09] message to them go eat tarry in the
[2:10] upper room and there you'll be in dwell
[2:13] with the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost
[2:15] there the comforter will come you see
[2:18] that is the that is the element that I
[2:22] believe people are missing in this day
[2:25] they're looking they're looking at
[2:27] they're looking at the physical things
[2:30] and forgetting that there's a life that
[2:33] needs to be lit you see so it's making
[2:37] people it's making people lazy and
[2:41] drowsy and nonchalant when in actuality
[2:47] these do you see how they had to act in
[2:49] the before this exodus they had to move
[2:52] you know they had to do something about
[2:54] this message that Moses and Moses gave
[2:57] them you see they had to act upon it
[3:00] right so let me go back to you come on
[3:05] oh this real quick
[3:12] so just real quick so what is a token
[3:17] it's a thing serving as a visible or
[3:21] tangible representation of a fact
[3:24] quality feeling excetera
[3:27] then give an example here I wanted to
[3:29] offer you a small token of my
[3:31] appreciation well when you give somebody
[3:34] a gift for example I give brother Bob
[3:37] this gift
[3:38] I appreciate for the bob now I gave
[3:53] rather Bob that gift but that's not me
[3:56] that's not me but it's a representation
[4:03] both of my appreciation to him
[4:06] so every time he looks at that token it
[4:09] should remind him of me right use your
[4:13] own sanctity so every time you look at
[4:15] the token amen the holy ghost working in
[4:18] a believers life or in your life and
[4:20] should point you back to Christ you
[4:21] shouldn't point you back to a man right
[4:25] it shouldn't point you back to a tape
[4:27] they shouldn't point you back to
[4:29] something physical all those things were
[4:31] good
[4:32] those were tokens amen to us you see but
[4:36] that that's not Christ again like I said
[4:39] the tape didn't die for me it was Christ
[4:43] that died for me amen Brian said here
[4:49] now what is first a token it's a word
[4:52] that's commonly used among we
[4:54] english-speaking people especially here
[4:57] in America token is a really that
[4:59] they're the dictionary says that a token
[5:01] is a sign it's a sign of a fair price
[5:04] paid see that the fair or price required
[5:07] price that's been paid I give you an
[5:10] example in Toronto when we go and get on
[5:12] the subway they don't use money
[5:15] order for you to get on the subway you
[5:18] have to have paid your fare and they
[5:21] give you these tokens and that's what
[5:23] you present to the person that's letting
[5:25] you in that's gonna let you in into the
[5:27] subway and if you don't have that token
[5:29] even though I got money I'll give you
[5:32] some money well that's not gonna work I
[5:35] got the Bible I've got the message I've
[5:39] got the picture of the Statue of a
[5:40] perfect man I've got I've got it all but
[5:42] that's not enough you got to have the
[5:45] talk right you've got to have that the
[5:47] representation of the life of what that
[5:51] is you see you have to have that life
[5:58] and that's what's gonna let you in God's
[6:01] not gonna look at you because you have
[6:02] you've listened to every single message
[6:05] that brother brown agrees or it's great
[6:10] that you do it's great that you read and
[6:13] you continue to do it over and over and
[6:15] over but that won't save you that's not
[6:20] gonna that's gonna save you it'll save
[6:22] you if you dress what the Prophet was
[6:24] talking about in those tapes and applied
[6:26] to your life that's what's gonna save
[6:28] you see so the children of Isreal they
[6:31] had this token they had the blood amen
[6:34] but they then they had the land and so
[6:37] in another place you know they in that
[6:40] the covenant of circumcision was given
[6:43] to them before Moses told him to go and
[6:46] and in apply the blood and on all this
[6:50] like this now what if a man would come
[6:53] up to Moses and say look I don't need to
[6:55] do that I've got circumcision I could
[6:57] show you I never would have been enough
[7:00] even though it was part of God's it was
[7:03] part of God's covenant that he had given
[7:08] to Abraham that would not have been
[7:11] enough that was not the token the token
[7:16] was that blood on the on the doorpost
[7:20] and Saints that blood why is it on the
[7:23] on the house because that house
[7:25] represents you
[7:26] you're you we are the body of Christ I
[7:28] see that that token has to be placed on
[7:31] your on your home you see it has to be
[7:34] on display there the letter there's no
[7:37] hey Christ was in here yes right yeah
[7:42] there's gonna be certain things that are
[7:44] gonna they're gonna come there was
[7:45] physically if we continue reading
[7:47] they're an exodus when we don't have
[7:48] know how much more time but we continue
[7:51] reading there there are other things
[7:53] that they had to do in order for them to
[7:54] prepare them for the journey they have
[7:56] to were they had to shop how shoes on
[7:59] while they were eating the lamb while
[8:04] they were eating the lamb they have to
[8:05] have shoes on in other words but coming
[8:07] to the Lord is soon at hand we need to
[8:09] be ready right right we need to be ready
[8:13] that was another the fact that they
[8:16] believed that message was the fact that
[8:19] they were acting upon the message in all
[8:21] those different areas but that was that
[8:24] blood showed that that lamb took my
[8:28] place and then that lamb dwells here and
[8:33] then they they had to eat all of the
[8:35] lamb like sister Paige said they had to
[8:36] leave that D all of the lamb including
[8:39] the entrance the heart the guts the
[8:44] brain everything kittens liver every
[8:49] single thing well I don't like that part
[8:51] of pres nasty they have to eat it all I
[8:57] like the way brother Sutton said
[8:59] preaches he steps on my toes too much I
[9:02] don't like what he says but is it the
[9:06] word that's the thing is it the word
[9:10] because if it's the word and it's not
[9:13] off the word you have to eat that right
[9:17] you see you have to in order in order
[9:20] you cuz you the body of Christ has to
[9:23] feed on all the work Amen praise God so
[9:28] the blood of the lamb was the token for
[9:29] Israel and
[9:38] program says here to the world it's a
[9:40] bunch of foolishness but to God it's the
[9:42] only way the only thing that he requires
[9:46] is that token it must be there and you
[9:49] cannot have the token until the ferret
[9:51] is paid so Jesus Christ paid the fare
[9:53] for us right then you are a possessor of
[9:56] the token which gives you the privilege
[9:58] of a free pass I'll see the blood I'll
[10:01] pass over you what a time that that what
[10:05] a privilege to know that you packed
[10:07] within you the pass when I see the blood
[10:10] I'll pass over you it's the only thing
[10:12] that he will recognize it's the only
[10:15] thing that you'll recognize God didn't
[10:17] give any other or any other substitution
[10:19] for the token it's nothing else that can
[10:22] take its place no substitute no
[10:25] denomination no nothing else it takes
[10:28] that God said that alone will I see so
[10:35] others are trying to put other things
[10:36] into place
[10:38] you see and that's what happened in the
[10:39] Garden of Eden the Adam and Eve when
[10:43] when when they had to do with with a
[10:45] life right it was they they sinned and
[10:50] then they try to put in a substitute
[10:53] something that was easy
[10:55] something that was simple you see but
[10:59] that God had to provide himself a lamb
[11:02] you see God had to give them the lamb
[11:04] amen and say put those skins on don't
[11:06] put that way I don't want your your your
[11:08] religion I don't like it I can't stand
[11:12] it I don't want you to be to be colored
[11:14] by that I want you to be covered by this
[11:16] and there was blood involved with that
[11:18] two things so does anybody have any
[11:22] comments or any questions
[11:26] it occurred to me while you're talking
[11:28] almost countries in Asia at least before
[11:31] you go into somebody's house remove your
[11:33] shoes so it just kind of struck me when
[11:36] it said super shoes or while you're
[11:38] eating that was part of the armor the
[11:49] armor the whole armor of God yes that's
[11:51] right I mentioned that when I was in
[11:53] Toronto a couple of weeks ago I I was
[11:55] mentioning that and I told them I said
[11:56] all the Filipinos here because there's a
[11:58] lot of Filipinos there at the church
[12:00] Oh Filipinos here they look they just
[12:02] take they love taking off their shoes as
[12:03] a custom to take off your shoes when you
[12:06] go into a house but they're in Canada a
[12:08] lot of people do it anyways because the
[12:10] there's salt on the roads it's just
[12:12] nasty and you don't want to go in the
[12:14] house so so but I said in this case in
[12:18] this case they had their shoes on
[12:23] rather Brad said you know he just come
[12:26] to tell us the word it was thrilled not
[12:28] give it a roll I should tell us the
[12:30] Revelator we got get drilling but what
[12:34] are the people gonna do when it says the
[12:36] Bible says the fivefold ministry will
[12:39] affect the same
[12:41] I'm a perfectionist hide you get so that
[12:45] there's really saying that but cut
[12:47] brother bronsted at the back home
[12:49] magically perfect assignment so they're
[12:52] really saying you did you didn't really
[12:54] tell us the word because they saying
[12:58] that that's not right five minutes so
[13:01] it's a it's unfortunate its segment
[13:08] perfect for a Sunday School lesson I'm
[13:11] sort of Church and brother branham big
[13:14] brother Ben questions an answer for the
[13:17] rim says you're perfectly by the Holy
[13:19] Ghost but really that's the hot that's
[13:32] all you try some from a naked man I got
[13:35] their folk that's all I don't like but
[13:38] really an actuality you take redness
[13:40] both things together it's the Holy Ghost
[13:43] and they're awful just like it's not
[13:45] just a lot of the ministry is sound just
[13:47] why brother others don't enough so you
[13:48] can't put faith that God can speak
[13:50] through human flesh and yeah cuz you
[13:53] can't see past this veil with all its
[13:56] faults and failures that the God that
[13:58] created all the things that stuck
[14:00] through Brennan can speak through us
[14:01] that's absolutely there's a quote that I
[14:04] wanted to read to you I don't have time
[14:06] but brother barely mentions that he says
[14:08] he says we don't have faith of the
[14:10] minister cannot help you
[14:12] I cannot even help you if you don't have
[14:14] faith in what I'm telling you since
[14:16] right right so therefore if you already
[14:19] come with your mind insane I I don't I I
[14:22] listen to the tapes that's the voice for
[14:26] my day and when you come to church and
[14:28] you're listening to the minister it's
[14:33] coming but it's just kind of hit
[14:36] you know and you're not going to be able
[14:38] to get what is being preached because
[14:41] you already put a filter there yes these
[14:58] are his words bourbon you will become
[15:00] what you pay attention if it is
[15:08] repetitive and if it does if that didn't
[15:10] work then marketing wouldn't work you
[15:14] custom to here commercial over and over
[15:16] and then when you hear the jingle
[15:18] somewhere yeah they reminds you of that
[15:20] coffee thank you the best part of waking
[15:23] up true absolutely that's absolutely
[15:41] right and then and that that's the
[15:45] because you have to you have it has to
[15:47] agree with in a word that you have
[15:50] received as well and you see not just
[15:52] because well you know he said it and
[15:54] that that must be it but that's the
[16:10] things things do you know it for
[16:12] yourself whether Dale probably has had
[16:15] lots of things for many years do you
[16:17] know it for yourself about Ron do you
[16:19] know that where he got that from you see
[16:21] which is investigating the Bible listen
[16:25] to the tapes that's right I mean I hear
[16:27] some ministers when they preach I'm
[16:30] scared that they discount bella rhythms
[16:34] so I'm you know are the food their
[16:37] wording that I'm scared that
[16:40] young couples you know coming here that
[16:44] bait makes the oh right they don't have
[16:46] to listen to the tape yeah and you can't
[16:48] do that
[16:48] and another thing is there's a balance
[16:50] we are so fortunate to have the ministry
[16:54] we have here but what about people that
[16:57] go to that church you know what about I
[16:59] mean they like she said they believe
[17:02] with them and we're really blessed but
[17:06] you gotta find someone Holly goes just
[17:10] got a late June which goes back to have
[17:13] you read the Bible is mistake if you
[17:17] don't have you a church to go to you
[17:20] better be listening to those teams
[17:22] consistently neither that mean your
[17:23] church I'm in being better but when you
[17:26] got a church to go to services both
[17:29] morning and evening
[17:31] you decide to stay at home when you know
[17:34] the words going forth that's between you
[17:39] and God but you know people must not
[17:42] think because with those two quotes that
[17:45] you said with two different sentences
[17:55] what do they mean if you believe in a
[17:58] prophet you truly believe you would have
[18:01] to think about because the word says it
[18:15] obviously and then the Prophet he spoke
[18:17] about it you know bring the balance of
[18:20] that so let's go ahead thank you over
[18:23] here
[18:25] [Music]
