come lonely days without the sun if there's sorrow more like you i'll be calm i'll trade sunshine for rain comfort for pain that's what i'll be willing to do and whatever it takes for my will to break that's what i'll be willing to do that's what i'll be willing to do yes everybody ready to hear the service you don't end get to doing good to see everybody just pray the lord would open our eyes because that's why we sing the song right to where we can do that part amen let's get right on into service remember all these that are sick among us the lord would be with each and every one all right open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart i want to see amen glory as we sing holy holy holy high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory you love him pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy think about him holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy i want to see everybody what does c mean understand i want to understand him because you know what you got to understand him before you can see him physically see him you've got to have to understand him first he said the world will see me no more but i'll be with you and you'll be able to see me the world won't be able to see but you'll be able to see me good to be back in the house of the lord good to see every one of you back and good singing and good worship so we thank the lord for all that i still do not believe how that little little woman can sing that cloud she got pretty long neck though so i guess those vocal cords are kind of stuck in there you know so she can wonderful addition to the church that group is now that family yeah absolutely hey man good to see some fresh faces come in every once in a while help us out a little bit but if you got your bibles let's turn to second peter one we'll uh get started right into the right into the service and try not to uh be so long today we're gonna have a little patience temperance first and then patience just remember all these announcements and look downstairs and and thank these brothers you know when you go by and see that beautiful thing that they've got down there that uh announcement board that we don't have to write on there anymore that it's just constantly moving and and showing you what's going on in the church so we thank the lord for the brothers to do that i um i was talking to a guy yesterday we were um i'm taking a beekeeping course uh commercial beekeeping course from a man and he had a student there with him and and the guy was telling us how he couldn't get this done on the internet and he couldn't get that done and he was gonna have to do this and he's gonna have to pay for this gonna have to pay for that i just in my heart i said well thank god we got a group of guys god brought them here to do what needs to be done amen because we sure if we would have had to sub out a lot of this it'd be very very expensive so you you thank these brothers you know what a lot of times when we're at home sitting reading you know times magazine joe or some of them luis or some of them are back there trying to put something together like that downstairs for the church because it just doesn't create itself it has to be created by somebody and then put in to whatever like even this what goes into this is a is a is a monumental accomplishment that a lot of churches don't get and if they do get it they have to pay a lot for it so we thank god that he's put he's put these uh able-bodied brothers that can amen that can use their talent not only in their job but in the service of the lord so we thank them for that always but remember all the ones that are sick good to see brother gary back with us and uh just keep him in your prayer have strong faith that's what we're talking about you gotta have that strong faith that virtue faith where where you can uh draw strength from each other and not be divided draw strength from each other and um and i believe there's a lot of strength in here to be drawn from sometimes we just don't plug it in the right generator you know but we got to plug it in the generator and uh overcome all these things because you know what we're all overcomers through jesus christ all of us we we may you say well i'm not like brother joe or bill luis well you got jobs tale you got a job still it's not just them everybody's got a job every person's got a job if your job is just to say amen and show up to services that's an overcoming ability that a lot of people don't have so ii peter one start with verse one let's uh let's bow our heads before we get started heavenly father we pray lord that today that you would be held up lord that it would be you father not us that you would be lifted up high above all because we know that there's one thing for sure that as a as a creator as a living god you came so low to us to get us and take us back to where you are father what a mighty god what a mighty king what a lord of lords that would come down and down an old rugged cross for such a worm as i somebody that didn't deserve it lord but you knew that we would there would be a part of us that would want it more than life itself and lord now it's a gift that you give us and it's ours so let us take our gift from you the holy spirit and let us add these virtues to our faith and let us believe in you father forgive us of our sins and many mistakes be the ones that are sick and not here lord the ones that maybe are are a little feeling a little bad here we pray lord that you would as the word goes forth that you will just heal them father let them just forget about what's going on and focus as the man at the gate called beautiful he focused on what peter said and forgot about that he couldn't walk and he stood up and walked father we pray that you just bless us now take care of us be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor father we ask just bless each one take care of us lead this guide us by your holy spirit in jesus name we pray amen second peter 1 verse 1 simon peter a servant and apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace grace and peace if you don't want turmoil get into this it'll give you a little peace grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness so we were talking about the same thing today life your everyday life living in godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us the glory and virtue whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these what these promises the ones he's made right here you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and diverse your knowledge and knowledge temperance temperance patience patience godliness into godliness brotherly kindness and the brother the kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall you may be seated in the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now what we're talking about this morning just the background again because it's uh it's something that that uh if you say it 15 times they said you know if you say it 15 times they'll get it so you're on about number seven so you're halfway there to where you can recite this amen there's nothing we can we can remember we can pride ourself remembering all the 50 states how many of you can name the capitals of all 50 states say how many of you knows what i like that what brother brown said he's talking about that guy that was a bible student he's talking about the days and miracles of the past he said he went through about three scriptures and he finally said do you know john 3 16. the guy couldn't even quote any scripture he i believe it's on the statute proper man can you not quote john 3 16 he couldn't quote all the other in john 5 48 and all those like that so he couldn't quote them but it's not our intellectual thinking how many times have you me and all of us have been going through life and we've we've we've god has brought things to our remembrance that we would have never remembered naturally we would have never remembered because he said i'll put in your mouth what you need how many times have you walked away from somebody and said i should have said quit doing that because you know what if you're standing in the in the if you're standing in the protection of the almighty and if you don't say it it's not time it for it to be said all right so you just trust in that i've always all of us have second guessed and said man i should have said well no it wasn't time because you know what if you'd have said that it might have been a stumbling block or it might have been something they couldn't digest at the time so hold that thought though say it a little bit later when you're led to say that because remember the bible tells you you're going to be brought before kings and all these kinds of judges and he said don't worry about it in other words you don't don't study you know the day before don't study the day before he said i'll give you what you need then all right but still you got to study to show yourself approve all right you got to do some studying it's not you don't do no studying then you just sit there and say god just pour it in me well you know who gets there first don't you yeah okay the devil gets there first if you didn't know that he gets there first and then uh he muddles the thing up but we were starting this morning we're looking at the chart now start with justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost faith is our foundation right all right and then how we get it is ephesians four apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists gonna try to go through this pretty quick so we can get to a little more on temperance everybody like temperance that was a good one this morning i like temperance was something that you really think well that's my temper that's my temper no it's control it's not even just control your temper it's control it's it's and i'll read you a quote here in just a few minutes where brother brown talks about supreme power in control so we'll but he gave what some apostles prophets pastors or evangelists and some pastors and teachers for what the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come all right so it's a journey till we all come not when you get it but till we all come to the unity of faith and knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ all right so we know what to get we know who to get it from now we just got to go get it amen all right that's where that bible says diligent you got diligence means you go seek something you got to go for it it's not going to come to you you got to go get it all right so you got then we got now hebrews 11 1. don't ever forget faith faith is what that's the foundation you can't sit there and not believe and get anywhere okay you can't just say well i'm in the message or i'm in this or i'm in that you've got to believe and put yourself in a place to where uh you can believe go to hebrews 11 1. brother bob brother bob is uh taking brother munini's place back there brother anderson but without faith it is impossible impossible to please him i can say that because i can say it right munini is right right brother anderson extra i thought so he said you say it very well i said thank you for he that you've got to be careful but he that cometh to god must believe that he is what he is god he's the creator he's the one he's the one that has given us all this and he is a rewarder what's the reward virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness the statue of a perfect man that's your reward for diligently seeking god how in the world are we going to believe and have faith if we diligently seek something not believing that god's going to give it to us how are we going to do that you got to believe that he's going to give it to you once you get there all right and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him hebrews 11 1. now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen all right so what we're talking about this morning the substance of faith is what you add because that's the substance you got you can't just have faith alone brother brown said faith alone won't do it right that's a shocking statement yeah that a prophet will say well you gotta have faith and he builds his whole he builds his whole sermon on faith and then he says faith alone won't do it right okay so what he's saying he's calling you to another level to a higher level in god because he knew that's just staying at faith nobody changed right even not is including a body change it's just being a little more a little more of a man in god instead of a baby yeah because god don't want a bunch of crying babies right all right you don't want a bunch of crying babies he wants us to grow up in him and have what we were talking like this morning the controlled faith and all these things that we have we virtue faith he wants us to have strong faith he wants us to have knowledge faith knowledge and how to take the word and how to how to be to where where where we can you know let me just be real honest peter didn't have to go back to jesus to get what he had right all right peter didn't have to go to paul to get what he had and that's what brother dale's been doing he's been trying to build you know a lot of preachers and i'm going to say this and i don't care if you like it or not there's a lot of preachers that come they want to meddle in everything you do they want to know how everything's going and they want to pick and choose and you know but you know what that makes babies stay babies one day my dad said look if you're gonna walk ain't happy tomorrow if you're gonna get anywhere walk by yourself same way with us as christians he's trying to build christians where we are individuals that we don't have to call brother dale every 15 minutes i know that's what he's doing he's doing he told brother colley he wanted to get enough where he's wanting to get enough in us to where hey one day if we are separated guess what right you ain't got to go find somebody you got it in use you said well i'm a i'm a woman i'm not a preacher i don't make one hill beans worth of difference to god we're all one the bible says in the body of christ one amen now we know they can't preach but that doesn't mean they can't get a revelation probably sometimes better than men they're wired a little different than we are amen praise the lord anyhow where are we from venus they from mars or something they're on some weird planet somewhere off somewhere but look god wants us all to grow i think sometimes in the message we think well the men's got to do this and the women's got to do this you know if we're all one in christ then we're equal if it goes back to before the fall then it was adam and eve and when god looked at adam and eve he saw one he didn't see a lower form he just saw adam in another form he didn't see a lower form he saw adam in another form called eve and that's why that jesus christ and us are joint heirs whatever jesus got we got right amen if we ever realize that then we'll go somewhere all right because whatever he's got because he had these he had these working in his life and he was that headstone now you and i have got to get back to that place still that headstone now lives in us all right then really john 5 there where it says the world will see me no more but you'll see me right because i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world all right virtue let's look at let's go to uh the chart with virtue and everybody knows that virtue is strength and that's what we must have we must have strong faith that's why i like to call it need to be one that says virtue faith brother bob brother anderson must have hid that one from you on purpose but that should say virtue faith because it is it's not faith and you leave it at the foundation it spurs your faith it comes up to where it says thank you that's pretty quick virtue faith which is a strong faith you and i remember to have strong faith we must do what exercise you must exercise your faith we have not because we ask not all right now that's pretty simple but to me that's virtue faith that's taking the faith you have and asking believing that god's going to do it amen that's what we got to get to because remember just regular faith won't do it baby form faith is good that gets you started with the new birth but that alone will not do it right all right it takes a virtue faith or a strong faith brother brown said one time you know he's talking about uh jousting he said it's not just that you got a joust he said when you stick that thing into the heart of that opponent you got to make sure you push it in it takes a strong arm of faith to handle the devil and that's what we're looking at god is now adding something stronger to equip us for the journey right all right for our journey to to go on all right so now let's look at knowledge we don't have to stay on board we we've run through virtue a few times knowledge remember what we're talking about this afternoon this morning knowledge faith is what discernment the ability to decide right from wrong the ability to discern is a requirement of all christians totally a requirement of christianity is to be able to discern right from wrong like i said before how many times have we been in meetings where we we hear somebody preach a sermon and and we hear you know something that that maybe is not exactly the truth and you feel that little that little bump right there's a little something goes off in you well what is that to me that's knowledge faith brother dale and the ministry here has put enough knowledge faith where we can acquire it he can't give it to us he can put it up where we can get it all right so we can get that knowledge faith and we can sit there in the crowd of 600 people and not feel bad because the first thing the devil's going to do is say well you think you are writing all these 600 people wrong you know the devil he works with numbers god don't care a thing about numbers he takes gideon and says gideon i want you to fight a battle 30 000 people he said we got it whipped god said no you don't that's too many that's right cut sit down gabriel said we're still okay we're about even now god said nah we're not using that many got down to 300 people and they destroyed an army of like 30 000 people 20 some thousand people with 300 people so god don't deal with numbers but the devil does the devil thinks if he can get enough piled over here on his side he can defeat god with it he can get everybody on his side see because you know what he's selfish oh yeah satan is a selfish selfish person it's always i i mean me selfish stuff god's always said hey gideon you take 300 and you go down there and you get the work done so god you know he come down and uh and save the whole world with one man so he's not worried about numbers i'm not worried about numbers but satan he likes to get those numbers together you know but so he says well 600 people out of 600 people you guys must be wrong and then but still something does what that anchor still holds in there and you walk away from that service going thank you lord not thank you that all and really not thank you that 600 people were wrong no your heart bleeds for that amount of people that have been ill taught but you say thank you god that i was able to discern the truth from the error and to pull it apart and then amen the right part and then oh me oh me the bad part are the part that's not right because look people the only way we're going to take a body change is to be 100 what jesus preached for three and a half years is that headstone we must be 100 true in our word or there's no body change 100 not one word off right 100 what that man preached for that three and a half years it's got to be back in the end time or we don't take a body change right amen so there's where knowledge faith comes in faith to discern and then when you discern it what do you have to do you have to believe what you deserved just like that situation with that you know you got to walk out of that auditorium and say god i know the truth you showed me the truth you got to believe that knowledge faith what is faith faith is belief so you got to have a knowledge that what you believe is right all right so you put all these things together and because wisdom you come back to the word wisdom which is the ability to think and act using knowledge see what we've done is is we and i hope you don't mind me using that that example but what we done we took the knowledge that we had previously heard all right yeah we're sitting in this auditorium 600 people the brother gets up and he's preaching you know just say the river jordan doctrine he's talking about you know jesus not being god well everybody else is up shouting and we're not well what we're doing is is we're if we had not had something to build on a foundation before amen a foundation before if we had that knowledge we carried that knowledge with us to the meeting we didn't get it there because all them other ones got knowledge but it wasn't knowledge faith it was an it was a human man's knowledge not godly knowledge all right so we brought that in because wisdom is the ability to think and act using knowledge experience understanding common sense and insight and then we we read what brother brown said it would take a group of people with prophetic insight right the only way you're going to be able to understand any of this is you're going to have to go from the natural realm to the supernatural realm because these are not natural virtues these are supernatural virtues right sure you can have these virtues man virtues but to have these kind of virtues that the prophet of god is talking about and that peter was talking about you must have supernatural understanding all right not super-duper right everybody gets super-duper revelations and they're mostly wrong but to have a supernatural revelation to have supernatural knowledge that puts you in another category i just believe it does now temperance this morning we were talking about temperance bring temperance faith and and i i thank everybody not everybody but most of you that came up to me and said that they really enjoyed it because because most time we look at this right here and the first thing we do is we look at anger and madness and mean and i got to get rid of my anger and you know i got it's really not all that it's control temperance means self-control then you can put whatever you want to underneath that self-control of of not tattling brother branham he you know being a tattletail loose lip and all that stuff or your temper or um some people are are um like me your mouth runs before your brain has a time to catch up i raise mine brother dick brother okay brother yes lord bless you i'm in a group thank you they say group therapy's good they're older than i am so i got a long way to go temperance faith but look temperance is what controlled faith it's a faith that you have with control behind it all right same way with brother branham the instance remember when he walks into the house now see to me that's temperance when brother brown walks in the house he said there'd been a hundred people in my house all day devils and people won't be prayed for him people prophesying thus saith the lord brother ram you've got to go here and he said my wife was crying my kids were fighting joseph was throwing things and he said when i walked in he said i knew right then i had to change the situation now he could have walked in there like most of us and said woman where's my food and you should duck when you say that get up and beat the kids and make it worse what brother brown day he put on an apron yeah he's you remember he kept saying now god he kept touching me to he said he's honey i i i saw him dress over there and she's like a dress what are you talking about a dress all this junk going on talking about he said i just kept saying lord what was it that was controlled faith to me that was temperance in total control brother branham he said remember 10 minutes later he said sarah and becky were playing together joseph was you know doing what he was doing and she was wanting to go look at that blouse now what that was a control that was a controlled faith that's the only and you say well that was patience well that was patience too but the first thing was is if we would have walked in first thing would happen is something would have rose up and said you need to be doing this you need you understand what i'm saying but he walks in and says look he says lord this thing's got to change so he took that controlled faith or temperance and changed the whole situation changed the whole thing without having to whip the kids and without having to say anything wrong to his wife and it's what we were talking about this morning that controlled faith it says i believe i can see he walked in knowing that he could change that situation just by being in control all right you want a little more of that let's go on a little bit further let's go to um we won't read titus or any of those but you can go to quote number nine if you want to what we were talking about this morning on temperance faith and i hope you enjoyed that because it really helped me because because i didn't really even see that it was it was that much of a control when i was downstairs but because look tempers doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol either no no tempest doesn't mean alcohol it's cured not in this case this is bible temperance holy spirit temperance that's just one of the lusts of the flesh what i was talking about you know if you're still doing all those things you're not even in the body you don't need to take communion you don't you need to get yourself right then you can come into the body of christ and you get all the benefits all right that's just one of the lusts of the flesh but we're talking about holy spirit temperance that means how to control your tongue not be a toddler how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you oh my oh temperance well i've read you said boy a lot of us are going to fall off before we get started aren't we and these things add temperance to it oh temperance how to answering kindness when wrath is spoken to you all right and then you keep going on to save time go to the next go the next quote number 10 now if you got this like that add it to your faith if you still blow up and sass and fuss and stew and carry on uh huh you ain't got no you can't add that because it won't add see it won't vulcanize you couldn't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron and that's what we try to do a lot of times we still got that old stony heart we got that old heart of stone and we're trying to vulcanize god's spirit with it and it won't work all right you got to have the heart of flesh to attach it to all right same thing with here a piece of iron it just won't work no it's got to be flexible just like the rubber is and when your faith and your temperance becomes the same kind of holy ghost temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him you're added to it when you virtue is like his then add to it when your knowledge is like his same thing all the way down all right let's go to 10a i pulled this one up just a few minutes ago and i want to read this one to you this is neat why are my people so talked about that's a real good message to read by the way why are people so tossed about if you've been tossed about read that message all right some people get the wrong impression of what the anointing is remember we talk about this at the end of the service this afternoon this morning was was its control temperance is control all right did you ever think of that when was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone and what did they do when they had the anointing it's talking about jesus christ right in luke chapter 4 the greatest anointing was ever given to anyone was jesus christ we have the spirit by measure he had it without measure and one day he had entered in the temple and picked up the scroll and read said the spirit of god is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the acceptable year to bind up the broken hearts heal the sick give sight to the blind and now we would think if such anointing was on him that had been prophesied 800 years before it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the lord upon him we would want to run all over the building scream and holler yeah but the bible said he laid down the scroll set down and precious word proceeded from his mouth that's what he done under the anointing the anointing is not emotions right the anointing is supreme power in control control faith supreme power in control like knowing exactly what and how and look what he said and that's what's here he was saying it was here and that's what's here the anointing is not emotion the anointing is supreme power and control you know when jesus looked down at those scrolls you know what he did he identified his self in the word that's the same way with me and you if we ever identify ourself in that word and he knew that word was talking about him well i figured maybe inside of him he wanted to get up and run around and shout but he knew he had a word he had something to do that's right so he oh he closed the book he laid down the scroll sat down in precious words in other words he preached him a good sermon i bet you he preached them a just a monotone it didn't get any loud you know there wasn't a lot of hollering the anointing is not emotions so controlled what we when we look at temperance when we looked at temperance before to me that's an emotion you got temper that's an emotion right we take all the emotions the anointing is supreme power in control the anointing is not emotions the anointing in other words what he's saying is you don't have to be way up here for the anointing to hit you or way down here for the anointing to hit you amen you just got to know where you're at in the word it's when the anointing will strike amen you got to know where you're at in the word identify yourself not your pastor not your brother sister or mother you got to you got to identify lord this is where i'm at right here all right now look if that's where you're supposed to be talk about matching pieces if that's where you're supposed to be and god saw you in that because look he said this was prophesied 800 years before jesus is reading a scroll that somebody said the spirit of the lord is upon me 800 years ago it was talk he said hey that's me that's me that's what i'm here for that's my commission that's what he done under the anointing same thing with you and i you get temperance it's not going to just absolutely make you cause you know what let's just take brother gary krantz hey buddy i don't believe he'd get well i've seen him upset a few times i've never seen him mad that's right okay i don't think you could get him mad that i know of but see that's him in his nature to a degree but boy being born again makes him real me you know real my real me he he married julie so that's enough them that's enough to get you going anyway temperance patience brother sorry we're getting patient in just a minute i'll use her for that in a minute but do you understand what i'm saying to to just say well i need temperance because i got a bad temper that's not all that right let's work on what let's say well i got a temper i got to get rid of it no let's say well i got a problem god help me control control how to control brother since how to control well i got it on blasphemous names but i didn't bring it he says how to control your ungodly temper that's what he said how to control it that's the same thing with all of us we need plenty of control and temperance so let's let's put temperance as a controlling factor because when he controls look you're getting on up here pretty good now yeah you know you get on up there we got patience godless brother kindness but that baby right there i'm telling you that's kind of the middle too that's the one where you really gonna have to move through that knowing that you have now a controlled faith a faith that will control all situations brother branham that's the same way he was i mean you know brother billy paul was amazed a lot of times that and how his his daddy was so in control why that wasn't that seventh grade education man in control he was moving over and letting that control that was in him come out all right you say well i got a temper well if you got the holy ghost you got one inside of you that don't have one that doesn't have one so who's winning you feed this one he wins you feed this one he wins kind of simple all right like brother brown now remember brother branham remember the lady told him said tie them knots around your finger when you get mad tie ten you know tie knots around your finger remember he said he got mad at them boys he said he tied about two knots throw the string down and i'll off you know off to beat them kids up or try to but he had that was a temper and the lady was trying to get him to do it by human ability but when he come up to the born-again experience i don't believe he could have done nothing to him to make him upset all right i'm not upset now we get upset i'm talking about temper temper is red-faced and mad yeah yeah i mean we all get upset and frustrated we get frustrated at ourself more than anybody i get frustrated at me than anybody else but that's just human nature but then you know god you've got to see that god has put something in you to control that right all right so we have control faith which is temperance all right and let's define that if you want to brother um now let's don't don't worry about it don't worry about it let's go to quote number nine go back up one i want to read this one again go back to nine there you go cause look look if it's the right kind of virtue right then add knowledge if it's the right kind of knowledge now we're going to add temperance and then temper if it's the right kind of temperance right that's once you get see it's what he's saying the right kind of temperance is what control so the right kind of temperance is the controlling factor in this whole thing and to me it's going to control not only you but see you got to look look at knowledge look how that thing builds on top of each other you take the knowledge that you have and to me if you have the right kind of knowledge that's what's saying here if you've got the right kind of knowledge then that right kind of temperance is going to lay right on top of that that's right because remember knowledge is knowing discerning discerning good from evil or right from wrong and then right there lay's temperance to control that part of you that you've discerned this part's right then god's going to send you down this avenue and control that he's going to control you i we just have a lot of problem with controlling ourselves we try to control ourselves we can't do that we got to let go and let god do it he said well brother that's too simple i don't think that's too simple i think being having controlled faith is is to me it's it's paramount before you get to patients because boy patience we're going to get to it right now in just a second let's go to patients now because it's the next one and it's patience faith we got to go we got to continue with the faith go to patience faith because remember it's faith all the way up patience faith now what is patience go to luke 21 19. luke 21 19 says in your patience possess ye your souls now you don't have two souls that ain't a two-soul doctrine all right he's talking about all of us in your patience possess ye your souls now watch the definition of patience go to patient the definition keep that in mind endurance steadfastness constancy what is constancy if you know what to control you can stay constant if you know what you can control you stay constant with that all right because you know what how can you believe something and then you get up so far and you say well i don't believe that anymore i believe this well not in this people you can't do that you can't do that now if you're not born again sure you can come up to say well say matthew 28 19 you know say well baptism named the lord jesus christ that's exactly correct and then two years later say no i don't believe that anymore now that don't put you in the bot that does that's not discerning the right way no we take the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ all the way from faith all the way up and it's enduring faith or it's faith that keeps going watch this right here steadfastness constancy endurance in the new testament it's the characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose now what was jesus supreme power in control he knew who he was and he knew the purpose he came here you got every one of you brothers and sisters everybody down to the children if you're born again you got a purpose god has given you a purpose and that purpose is up to you to fulfill it right it's up to you to fulfill it all right the characteristic of a man who has not swerved just like brother nick said brother dick said uh you know some things happen to me and you you need the glory in that tribulation worketh listen the ones that god loved he chastened and if he didn't know you could make it through it he wouldn't put it on you got it listen and i'm i'm just being honest with you if you come to a place right here and you say well i can't get rid of all this and i can't be in control that's where you're going to stay that's where you're going to stay and god knew that but you don't that's right so you've got to run we'll talk about this in just a minute with paul he's talking about running the race i think paul knew his purpose and he knew one thing for sure he wasn't going to see the coming of the lord right right he wasn't going to see the resurrection alive so he was trying to get the people to see that but he knew his purpose was though is to do one thing and that was to get a people ready at that moment all right he wasn't trying to get luther's people ready because he didn't even know who a man named martin luther was but he might have preached on justification he might have preached on these things but he didn't know the man's name was martin luther that come on down a little bit further but he preached what he did to the first church age people but it was so profound that it became the foundation for all seven church ages right all right because he was a prophet but this word enduring patience he said well i gotta have patience with my wife or patience with my brother branham i'll read it here in just a second he's going to tell you to have patience with first but let's read right here the characteristics of a man who has not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings about that patient enduring sustaining perseverance listen this has been a long journey remember sight and time is god's worst enemy because we get as we get more down the road we tend to lose a lot of this because we're human beings all right but the characteristic of a man who has not swerved from his deliberate purpose see that's a confident person that you come up to the statue of a perfect man you get the patience patience to me is confidence because when everything else is going wild the 600 people are shouting about whatever the guy was preaching brother was preaching on and then here you see it man you just got to have patience all right let's go to the next one let's go to romans 5 verse 1. and we're going to recap this next sunday therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand brother branham said one time he said if you've done everything you've prayed you fasted he said stand that's our problem people that's we just don't have enough patience to just stand there when you think a whole are all hells against you and your kids and your family and ever stand there that's what abraham did that's why he's the father of the faith he stood there all right wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of god and not only so but we glory in tribulation also that's a hard one knowing all right let's go back to knowledge knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience what experience and experience hope amen knowing that tribulation worketh patience the trials of our faith which is what much more precious than gold is showing us patience and we think well i gotta have patience with this one or that one the other let's just keep reading hebrews 10. we'll see what brother brown said first thing have patience with for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise for ye have need of patience that after you've done the will of god you might receive the promise brother brown talks about people and you've seen people that go out above the plan of god what happens he said it's a train wreck it's a train wreck we got to stay with the program of god not go out past the will of god this says after that you've done the will of god you'll receive the promise right right all right after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise all right let's go to hebrews 12 1 and two wherefore seeing we also are compassed about was so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin with just so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking under jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him there's that word endured right endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god run with patience the race that is set before us looking under jesus the altar and finish of our faith now look let's go to james 1 verse 2. james says my brethren counted all joy when you fall into many temptations the word divers means many one more time my brethren count it joy that's a hard one count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations look knowing this see there you got to go back to the knowledge you got to go back to that knowledge faith knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing now patience is pretty powerful that's a pretty powerful statement right there knowing this that the trying of your faith worked with patience that's why i said you can't leave faith faith when you're going through a trial what's going to hold you your faith is going to have to hold you because you know what circumstances your brain your thoughts your carnal ideas are not going to get you through that that's where many people fall they don't just stand say god i've done all i can do now look if you happen he's going to remind you of that okay if he said lord i've done all i can do he's going to say now how many times you missed church last month oh well let's go back and do the let's go back to the elementary get the abc's right yeah then let's work on this but when you've done all brother brown said you've done everything and why christ speak he says when you've done everything he said you stand there right hard to stand sometimes but you stand there stand there and believe for your children your husband wife parents whatever but you got to stand there and believe it and not see anything at all see patience why do you need patience why would i need patience with hannah my daughter if she was sitting on the front row full of the holy ghost i don't need patience when she's sitting there enjoying the word of god and groaning in the word of god i don't need patience for that the patience is i don't see her here and i know what she's doing that's the patience you gotta say god i believe your word and this is where i'm gonna stand cause knowing knowing with that controlled faith of temperance you stand there and say god you said it it's gotta happen you said it it's gotta happen now look our problem is i want you to watch this next one this is a good quote right here now it doesn't have a whole lot to do with the with the virtues but it does 1957 what does it take to make a christian life listen to this this is the whole thing i'm gonna read it all not gonna be long today we'll just read a few more quotes then we'll start again next sunday the holy spirit will make every movement like christ it'll make you christ-like the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience faith these things are what the holy spirit controls what do you say it was our emotion our emotions our emotions is not so much as jumping up and down you could do that a shin dig will bring that to you for those of you that don't know what a shin dig is it's a hoedown for those of you that know what a hold down is watch hee-haw but a shin dig is what they used to go it's a dance all right it's an uncontrollable dance i guess you might call it but a shindig will bring that to you but the holy spirit brings you into operation or in what what did we just talk about control temperance control of god that you walk see everything i read now i see temperance patience godliness brotherly kind everything brother brown says i see it because i saw it in this right here all right you could do that a shin dig will bring that to you but the holy spirit brings you into operation are in control of god that you walk in peace and in love and in joy with long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience roll it on up you see it isn't something that you do it's something the holy spirit does in you you see it's no longer an intellectual thought of your own it's a subconscious moving of the holy spirit oh i wish i could i wish i could shout the praises of god around the world to that church of the living god lula church there's where our pentecostal move failed we have some man-made musical clap hands jump up and down emotion when if we go back out in the street and the holy spirit doesn't govern our lives to cooperate with that we have not got the holy spirit i wish we could admit that but look he said that's not skim milk but brother that's what the church needs only life can come by the holy spirit but look right here it isn't something you do when you get up into these virtues it's not some you can't learn it from a book it's got to be like brother brown said it's got to be a supernatural knowledge a supernatural virtue a supernatural temperance now a supernatural patience it's the holy spirit does in you you see it's no longer an intellectual thought of your own right it's a subconscious moving of the holy spirit right see that makes it supernatural it's a subconscious moving oh i wish i'd shout the praises in the world for that but i caught that one and i thought man i'm going to read that because it's really good at this point we must realize listen when you get to that words patience right there you ought to know one thing's for sure it's not you it's not the old you doing any of that because the old you is down there at the bottom still babying around crying daddy daddy and can't get along with your neighbor all right come on people but once you realize you get up to that you know what that ought to bring such a peace right that ought to bring look that you walk a control of god that you walk in what peace and in love and in joy with long suffering goodness meekness and all the nine fruits of the spirit because you can actually take the nine fruits with the spirit and run them in all these two it's the same thing all right so let's go to quote number 12 and let's see what brother brown says about patience now then after that fourthly this statue of a perfect man sometimes we forget to read that for people that are listening the ones that are watching can see it the statue of a perfect man in 1962 then after that fourthly you want to add patience to your faith if you've got faith it worketh patience the bible said we just read that so this is patience now what's the next thing going to build this stature you know god has got real material in his building see how short we are brother sister see see why where we're at yes sir see we have glory we have shouts and things because we got faith but when we come down to these things here i believe he's pointing to that god can't build us into that stature see he can't he can't make us up to that kind of a place we got all these other things we fall slight off with it he can't build his church paragraph 233 patience with what what kind of patience patience with your wife and your kid first things have patience with god if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because faith worketh patience when god says anything you believe it that's all you got patience say well i asked him last night to heal me and i'm just as sick this morning oh my what patience god told abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one sign he was still believing he was patient with god uh-huh put him always before you let him be the next crossing thing you can't cross him so just keep him before you he said so and it's going to happen keep him before you that's right let's go to the next quote oh look yeah noah had patience no had real godly patience what about 120 years you know we preach an hour and we think everybody ought to get it and we don't have a lot of patience noah preached the same message for 120 years and only his family got it plenty of patience not even you fell from heaven wasn't nothing just as dusty as it ever was for 120 years when he was patient then god tries your patience that's right god tries them remember he put noah in the ark shut the door and it was seven days before after that before he even started raining i mean he was locked in that ark with all those animals he had to have a lot of patience all right let's go to the next one number 13. statue of a perfect man and we should have patience with one another too one time we get so much we get so much impatient with one another's and we think we got to be like moses moses had patience with the people look that's what caused them not to go over remember moses what he done he he couldn't go over because remember he struck the rock instead of speaking to it he didn't have patience all right like i've tried to get this message over to tabernacle to see that each member of the tabernacle become this i believe he's pointing to that it's hard to do i've tried to have patience this is 33 years say have patience women still bob the hair still just the same but just have patience see just have patience weight have to if you ain't got it don't try to build on this down here have patience all right let's go to the next one 14 is shalom 1964. some people say but brother branham i've tried and i've tried but wait a minute patience is virtue patience is holy spirit virtue now this is a year or more after he preached the statute of perfect man he's building on something here they that wait upon the lord shall renew the same strength you say how can i wait any longer just keep on waiting when you've done all you can do to stand then stand see just stand how am i going to do it stand look he said it's the truth and it's the truth he said it'll happen how i don't know that's our problem we'll try to figure out how god's going to do it now god didn't get put us here to figure it out just believe that happened he said so he promised it if he promised it it's going to happen that's all it can't waste in other words god can't have one thought like we're talking about and then turn around and say no i don't want that one i want to do another one no his thoughts are eternal all right let's go to the next one number 15. this is the thytaran church age church age book i like this one the scripture says i know your faith now he does not say here as he did to the church in pergamus you hold my faith he's not talking about his faith now but he's commending them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentions their patience now faithfulness and patience go together all right in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for it says in james 1 3 the trying of your faith worketh patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of our faith so that's what we're facing it's got to come to that romans 5 3 says tribulation work is patience how highly god regards this outworking of our patients as seen in james 1 4 but let patients have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing boy look if we get up here and he's talking about lacking nothing god's will it for us is perfection and that perfection is patience waiting on god and waiting for god look read that right there this is the process of character development amen how highly god has commended these saints of the dark ages you know of course that was a dark age that had patience but patience first thing you have what patience with god the problem is we go god when i don't see anything do we see to believe or do we believe to see i think we're supposed to believe and then that triggers something called faith and then we see it all right instead of one because remember if i see hannah on the front row worshiping god i don't have to have faith that she's going to get saved same way with any of us that's see to us that's too easy that's easy for us to say wow my children there they are no you've got to pray for him pray for him pray for him not look at the circumstances abraham didn't look at his circumstances abraham was not i don't believe abraham was worried especially at the very end because he come to the place where he couldn't do anything you know he could try to help god at first he could produce a little bit but when you got down to him 99 or 100 years old he's dead i think he said one day finally he just said hey god if you're going to do it you're going to have to do it because i can't do it myself god said i've been wanting you for 25 years to say that but now that you've said it i'll send you somebody named elohim in human flesh and i'll let him tell you what's going to happen because remember he didn't tell god didn't tell him at the first of the journey right that he was going to have the baby through sarah he just said you're going to be a father of nations this is what you're going to do we'll see in the development of his in the development of his journey it come to a place to where god said okay i'm going to do it through sarah same way with god now god come down through seven church ages and he said i'm gonna have a bride but at one day i'm gonna have a bride that's gonna take a body change one day i'm gonna have a bride not different from the others but yet also a little bit more up higher a little bit i'm going to send them a prophet where now they cannot just read i mean how many times do you read second peter when you right even not in the message i mean you know if you just was a nominal christian you read sure it's been in the bible for 2000 years right but how about applying it to you and then it be a requirement and then as that requirement comes you see your life being brought up in god that didn't happen in the denomination world they really don't know how to live it without the holy ghost you can't live it it's just it's just like they said it's alcohol it's anonymous it's just suppressing a feeling you know it's trying to get trying to get people to come to church and then they started going well we can't get anybody's church so now they can come as they want to you know see them big scientists come as you are well i don't mind you can come as you are here but just don't leave as you are one more time you can come as you are but don't leave as you are or actually don't leave as you were because remember this is a life-changing operation here this is not this is not something we try to a good thought or a suppression of our feelings and we need to we need you know we have set like you be like a monk yeah you know and that's okay if they want to do that but god didn't call us to be monks he didn't call us to be to where we didn't have a wife and and all the things like the catholic church says he called us to be full have a full christian life right children wife kids listen god knew you was gonna have problems with your kids way before you did right but my question is did he equip you for the job i believe he did he didn't just make you a parent he made you a holy ghost-filled parent my problem was in bringing my kids up is i didn't have the holy ghost so what kind of virtue could they draw from that and that's my problem what about you and i what about all of us all of us we could but we can't go back because you know what god didn't go well i knew you weren't going to do that so i should have told you before no it was a journey you had to go through it was a process you had to go through to have some virtue faith that you can pass it how many how the world are you going to pass it to your kids if you don't have it right right you got to have it first how are you going to pass it to your neighbor if you don't have it first how you going to present it to somebody if you don't have it first brother adam even says when he comes up to the to the great seals he said if if god doesn't come on the scene we're only presuming well my the man had sick healed dead raised the opening of the word to a partial amount right then he comes up to the seals and says we're only presuming if god don't come and do this presuming you know what presuming is venturing without authority i believe in the statue of a perfect man but see brother branham had to grow amen he had to grow in all these and then god god told him right there and on sunset mountain now he may not have told him told him but he was positionally placed to do a job now listen that wasn't all for brother branham i like what that brother said one time he said i think it was brother harris he said now you got to have a sword in the hand experience you've got to have a mount whatever experience you it's got to be you can't say well brother branham got the sword in the hand and he was the only one that had the word i don't believe that did he put that sword back in his sheath and take it with him no he passed it down remember he said i've preached a word break it down and he said i give it to the preachers and they break it down in little nuggets and give it to the people you remember what jesus did jesus did never passed out one slice of bread jesus never passed out one fish he just multiplied the word and his what preachers give the fish and the loaves to the people don't you think you need a five-fold ministry absolutely you need a five-fold ministry if you don't then we're not perfected let's stand musicians come patience number one patience with god we've had 50 years and you know why god's let it go 50 years to try our patience he just said right there god's going to try your patience listen don't worry about your neighbor or your husband or your wife or your children or your or your boss trying your patience god said i'm going to try your patience now he might try your patience through those people but he's going to try your patience so that you can become a better christian yes gloria not a different one a better one we're not different christians than the first church age we just know a little bit more as far as in the word of how to put this thing together now we're going to sing a song brother dick i told him what i'd like to sing is page 389 i want us to come to this conclusion and this faith i like this song it is well with my soul i want everybody to sing it get you a book if you don't have a book i'm gonna throw one at you try your patience well temperance first then patience but i want to sing this song everybody sing this is it's in the spiral bo spiral book sorry when peace roll be patient now whatever my life thou has taught me to say it is well with my soul though satan control his own blood for my soul amen oh it is worse is it well with your soul today with my soul it is well it is well with my soul my sins oh the bliss you believe that no more praise the lord praise the lord o with my soul it is well it is well with my soul i like this one and lord hates the day when my face with my soul singing time oh it is well with my soul it is well it is well with my soul listen to this now the lord is for thee for thy coming we've got to have patience the sky not a great revelation of the angel the rest on my soul the last one but the lord is for thee for thy coming we wake the sky not the grace the voice of the lord blessed hope blessed rest of my soul oh it is well let's lift our hands with our soul it is well it is well with my soul it is well with my soul it is well it is well with my soul amen amen there's some resolve have some resolve man tis for thee for thou come and we wait now the guy that wrote this or the lady that wrote this probably never heard the shout of the angel probably never heard the voice of the lord as far as the way we've heard it but hallelujah we've heard the shout out we've heard the voice what a privileged people listen if it's not well with your soul you know it you're the only one that does it but you know one thing for sure i was thinking the other day we're to manifest who we are it really doesn't matter how much we try to hide it this is manifesting time it's time for the god to everything's laid open the book's open everything's open right so we're going to absolutely show our colors somewhere down the line and we see a lot of people dropping off in the message brother gary that that that really never had it to start with but man i want i want us to all this week to just just ask god say look lord let me do a little checkup let me do some checkup let me let me go to the doctor go to the physician and get a checkup because you know there might be a little something wrong with the body the reason we're not out of here is there is something wrong with the body all right not our physical body for so much say but the whole body of christ we must be all working toward one goal right the sky not the grave is our goal we've heard the shout of the angel we've heard the voice of the lord hey it's not hope anymore right it's here i mean this is it you love the lord amen anybody got anything to say before we dismiss i hope everybody got healed today i hope everybody that had a heartache or a trial or a tribulation i hope today god has absolutely just wiped that thing out yeah we play our hearts out and not all the time do you sing everyday amen here i heard the voices of the savior when it comes from here it really doesn't matter if you can sing well you make a joyful noise sister go right here just johnny i go for um the follow-up on my tomorrow i on thursday and i'm asking the church to believe with me that when they go and find out what is going i have a hammock in my head i'm believing that the holy spirit gonna find out that with my blood pressure going that high that's what's causing it and when it goes look again it's not gonna be there and i want the church believe me when i go when i go in on thursday morning at 8 13 and get the results from the tapes and all that it's all as well but if it's not got them took care of it everybody remember that thursday morning thursday morning 8 15. you know what we put a lot of things in our little note pads and our little computer notepads why don't you put that in there and pray for her during that time well because they were too talked about had to go for colonoscopies i'm gonna ask i am asking the lord and we'll testify to them i had one two weeks ago they found no polyps no cancer and only a little bit of dive diverticulitis and they said that was normal for my age sure praise god for that and i'm looking for my brothers come back that's right amen amen he never left the healing business and he don't ever close his door it's he's he's got an open sign on all the time and it's all it's all because we believe we got to believe he's already done it he's got to believe he's already done it so you love the lord pray for each one pray for each pray for each person pray for all like brother donny said that when you don't hear the musicians well it's not it is good but it's not it's wonderful to hear your voices come up because a lot of times you know a lot of times you can you can hear this musicians before you can hear the the voice but you know what this is going to be the quietest place we'll ever be in when we get over there see it's not going to matter how much that we shout because we're not going to have a voice that goes away we'll be able to shout the victory but what a great thing to know though that god has given us something to me we let me talk tell us one more time you talk about brother brown we're talking about our emotions to me this what this is what calms our emotions the statue of a perfect man calms your emotions because when you first get born again there's a lot of things god does for you but then if you go through some kind of little trial you just everything goes haywire but when you but when you go on through a little bit higher up there to patients that say the reason you know you're growing is is you get you have those experiences and nobody knows them but you and how you really react to them you had that experience down here but you know several years later as you grew in the word maybe that same experience will come by and and you reacted a totally different way to it see that means you're growing that means that god has he he showed you this one that you failed he's going to show you this one that you won all right so you got to go through it you got to go through it because remember the remember the scripture says after you've
