name amen amen god bless you saints thank you for that um so let's go to the word this afternoon and we're going to read from second peter chapter one second peter chapter one a very familiar scripture to us and ii peter chapter one verses three through eleven all right according to his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness though the knowledge of through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust we just certainly want to escape that corruption where the things get more rotten by the minute and besides this give giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity from that scripture right here this is where we get this chart right here all right that's the statue of the perfect man now i wanted to concentrate on verse 8 through 11. for if these things be in you now if they are supposed to be in you amen we know that this is to perfect to perfect us on the outside but they got to be inside of you first by the holy spirit amen and if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful that's key see these things are going to produce fruit because brother of the holy ghost if you have the holy spirit in your life it's going to produce manifest a certain type of fruit amen and the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind that's pretty strong words and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins in other words you forgot where god saved you from wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fail amen for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ amen you may you may be seated the lord had blessing to the reading of his word praise god so it's if these things be in you now we have to understand again that we've we've explained this before that faith virtue knowledge temperance see all these things come from god amen you can't produce him on your own sure we have a little bit of of of some virtue some human virtue some human knowledge some human some human temperance we we're good to people i i know there's people out here that we see they're good they're patient there's some people that are more patient than some of us and they don't even go to church more patient than than some of us who say we believe the message and are christians filled with the holy spirit they got more temperance than some of us but but see these things amen true a true virtue true knowledge true temperance true patience true godliness and true brother ellis has to come by the holy ghost in your life and how do you get the holy ghost it's by a new birth amen by by by the new birth amen a revelation personally to you amen we all know these things but it is so key in order for you to manifest these things you have to be born again amen because they they will make you neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ again these things will produce the holy spirit in you will produce fruit amen right amen something's got to come out of out of out of god in you and it can't be you it's got to be him amen it's got to be his life because if his life is in you it's got to produce his life not your own thing not your own idea not your own way god is not interested in none of that god is only interested in his word amen in his word and then his word is life and his word should be our absolute amen praise god and and that's why the reason why i titled this uh uh give the diligence to make your calling an election sure in this hour saints it is so important that in this hour that we're living in so crucial so uh uh i believe the coming of the lord is in a hand i believe that that that that this thing is winding down i believe that this thing is uh is is is squeezing is squeezing us and and and sure it's it's happening in the world but you know i think ultimately it's god allowing it for you and me for me if you know over anything god is allowing it for you and me to what to examine ourselves this is not a time for us to get lacks this is not a time for for or to continue going our ways and some of us maybe even getting worse instead of getting holier we're getting we're getting worrier right it's for us to be able to examine ourselves and say where am i in the faith lord amen see as he said give diligence to make your calling and the election sure all right what what we what the things that that happened to us in order for us to do that amen squeezes have to come through you see sometimes uh so you know when you when you have an orange i always give it this example when you have an orange and you want and you when you squeeze amen that juice that comes out it proves what that orange is right you see that juice that comes out i'm not expecting pineapple juice to come out of the orange you see i'm expecting for orange juice to come out so sometimes squeezes and problems and tribulations amen are for us amen to see what we really are who are who did we really believe what is the word that we believe what what is this amen or is it just just another meeting just another coming to church just another message club because i believe some of us have treated the the coming to church coming just like we're coming to a club we're coming to a lodge amen i'm going to church i'm going to warm up a pew i'm going to warm up you know that's amen you need to be sure where you're standing in the word amen you need to know amen that what what is being is going forth in through by this behind this pulpit amen as being you're applying it in your life and fruit is coming out of that amen praise god amen so we are free moral agents god made us to be free moral agents god is not willing that any should perish but but that we come to repentance see and and it's awesome that god that's i believe that's the grace of god that god made us three more agents that we can choose to serve him or not right right amen but god knew that before the foundation of the world but god's not going to push you again as brother dale's been preaching lately amen chosen in him god's not going to push you through a tube and and the same way he pushed you is the same way you're going to come out and know amen there's got to be a choosing in your life as well you the things that have happened in your life has been because of choices bad or good that have happened in your life your mama didn't make you do it your daddy didn't make you do it your grandparents didn't make you do it your children don't make you do anything you decide ultimately what what it is that's happening in your life whether it's good or bad am i going to be a good father that's up to you as a father my children aren't going to dictate that the word of god is going to dictate that to me am i going to be a good husband i'm gonna look at the word and see what a good husband's supposed to be amen i'm not gonna look at anybody else i'm not gonna i'm gonna look at the word because there's no better husband than jesus christ was there's no better father than than the lord jesus christ amen there's no better son than the lord jesus christ amen that's the greatest examples that we have praise god so god knows who will make it and who won't he knew that before the foundation of the world praise god but we are free more agents to choose amen exactly where what what we're going to do amen with this word that's preached behind the pulpit are we going to take it really sincerely and apply it in our lives so that fruit can come out so that others can benefit from that fruit remember the fruit that you give off is not for you to eat is for others to enjoy right see the fruit that i get off that i give off is for zach to enjoy for brother dawn to enjoy amen they can learn something from oh wow praise god amen they can glean something from that fruit amen gain strength from that fruit you see but it's not for me i've never seen a tree eating its own fruit i've never seen a tree eating its own fruit the fruit that the tree gives off is for others to enjoy and for animals to enjoy amen praise god so look at yourself look at your life that way what fruit am i given amen is it good fruit is it bad fruit is it half rotten fruit amen because this fruit others are going to be eating from it as well amen others are going to be eating from that fruit praise god so i can do whatever i want to amen as a christian i can do whatever i want to that's right you know you know some people say some people say well you know it doesn't bother me to do this that or the other amen that's between you and god amen but i can go out here to the girl to the liquor store and buy me some vodka buy me a grape whatever gray goose or or 40 or whatever whatever whatever and i can drink but when i help when the holy spirit-filled person amen is truly filled with god they don't have a desire to do that anymore where i used to do it amen where i used to be comfortable doing it and being around my friends and doing it now when god changes your life there's no more comfort in that and the other thing is because i don't want other people to see me amen with a bottle of grey goose in my in my hand you see that's not who you are anymore praise god if i can do whatever i want to i just don't want to you know there's certain things that that i can do and i just don't want to not maybe because they're evil but sometimes it's because of their testimony's sake right there's many things you could put in there the bible's paul says blessed is the man who who whatever he do with he's not condemned within itself you see now that's between you and god whatever you think is good whatever you think is bad amen but amen we we need to make sure that that whatever we uh uh whatever we partake of amen is glorifying god and it's not damaging our testimony as christians because you could be your life could be a stumbling block just as much as a blessing to somebody somebody's always watching you always make sure i always remember that somebody is watching us maybe this is not what you came to hear this afternoon amen but this is uh maybe a little bit of admonition type word amen praise god every now and then we need to shake up amen sometimes amen get a hold of yourself amen amen and just and just so we can move on praise god amen this is what god put on my heart so but see some of the things that we do saints i don't i don't i don't smoke i i don't i don't drink i don't do none of these things and we do those things and we don't do those things it's because out of appreciation to god you appreciate the lord what he's done to you for you and therefore you don't do those things see i could i could i could go uh download all the uh the the hip hop music that i used to listen to when i was out in the world i sure could listen to outcasts and all those types of things i i could go back and listen to that if i wanted to the problem is amen i don't want to amen and the people that's what that's a problem amen the people having their life they don't have that i don't want to in them anymore they don't have that i don't want to do it amen they're doing it only because maybe mom and dad told him to do not to do it or my husband might catch me or my wife might catch me amen but if it's not in you amen to stop and let go of the world amen then something's wrong with you the altar is right here and you need to repent same thing with me we got to keep our testimony amen we got to check our motives amen check our modens to see if they're wrong amen if they're wrong or if they're right what are our motives like amen do you have good intentions behind the things that you do praise god is it too true is it to bless people amen is it to glorify god with your life or is it to just try to get away with things in your life and see how close you can live to sin before before falling in i'm just gonna just teeter-tatter you know i'm still over here in the church i go to church i read a little bit every now and then i i i shake the preacher's hand but i just you know i just want to i want to be you know you better make you better make sure that you know you you're going to end up falling at some point somebody's sitting there doing that the whole time at the grand canyon eventually the wind's going to come through and you're going to fall you're going to end up falling amen we don't want to live peter tattering amen on the world amen the world has nothing good for you amen for a christian praise god amen you know people will show who they really are i don't have to ask them you don't have to ask anybody they will just eventually show who they really are you know i don't have to ask a person coming in here you know uh with with with you know with dressed a certain way or whatever and walking down you know and and and like like a pimp or something like that and you know what kind of lifestyle he lives you know right you know what you know what uh somebody with long hair you know coming in here and and a shirt that that has you know this this right here and and and this you know you know what kind of lifestyle what kind of music they feed off of you know i don't have to ask them they just show it the same thing with you and i saints we just show where we really are we don't have to tell anybody we don't have your life will show exactly what's in you jesus christ said that out of the abundance of the heart speaketh the mouth you are going to say you are going to live exactly what's in your heart if the word is in your heart it's going to show forth the word there's going to be holiness in your life there's going to be temperaments there's going to be there's going to be a certain aura about you amen and nothing hypocritical either amen but if the word is not in your life and if that's not what you feed off on a daily basis it will show amen it will show so you're not fooling anybody eventually it will come to light i mean you can be fooling some of us here and you can be fooling people out there but you're never going to fool god you're never you're never going to fool god god knows exactly where you are spiritually in your life and so as ministers we have the responsibility to preach the word of god amen the whole counsel of god we're commanded to preach the whole council of god not just the things that you like to hear we are commanded to minister and preach the whole council of god we are commanded to teach the great doctrines of the bible whereas we are also commanded to preach against sin and to get into your home a little bit whether you like it or not right brother branham did he was the prophet of the age amen so did paul in the bible and he was one of the messengers of the of the of the church ages i believe a true called minister does that not because he's preaching against the people but he's preaching against the sin he sees the danger coming ahead amen and he knows that if he doesn't say something against that amen the people are going to be ruined it's going to drag them away that's right and i have to use brother wade uh i really got uh uh inspired by those scriptures that brother wade's been reading lately there in ezekiel about the watchmen amen now we're going to read those scriptures here in just a moment but we're going to read them in in the english english standard version it's a much simpler easier way to read them so that you could see the importance of god has called watchman over your life amen i think we should reverence them i think we should respect them i think we should we should we should thank god for it for them amen because they're there amen trying to listen amen to see what is it god that you want me to speak to the people in order to help them not to cling them on the head not to not to thump them on the head amen not to bring them down amen but to help them so that they could get up from their slumber amen and continue moving on with god amen praise god amen again it's not it's not to call you out but it's to call out the sin in your life that's that's the key to call out the sin in your life not to call you out i think that would be inappropriate for a minister to do that especially from behind the pulpit unless he's on one on one with you amen praise god so let's let's read let's read that ezekiel chapter 33 brother brother bob if you could bring that up from the english yeah let's just read this real quick the word of the lord came to me he said son of man speak to your people say to them whenever i bring enemy soldiers to fight against the country the people choose someone to be a watchman okay if this guard sees enemy soldiers coming he blows the trumpet and warns the people that's his duty that's his job amen and he shouldn't be criticized for it either because that's his job if people hear the warning but ignore it the enemy will capture them and take them away as prisoners that's going to be the consequences if the if the watchman doesn't do his job they will be responsible for their own death the people will the watchman's not responsible if he's doing his job they heard the trumpet but they ignored the warning so they are responsible for their own deaths i'm not responsible brother wade's not responsible no minister is responsible if the word is being preached then you don't go do exactly what the word says that's between you and the word that's between you and god they heard the trumpet but they ignored the warning so they are responsible for their own deaths if they had paid attention to the warning they could have saved their own lives but instead you know he's just up there meddling he's just up there you know just ask just him that i'm not gonna you know no what if he's telling you the word of god [Music] amen but what if the guard sees the enemy soldiers coming but does not blow the trumpet since he doesn't warn the people the enemy will capture them and take them away as prisoners they will be taken away because they sinned but the guard will also be responsible for their deaths that's not something that i want to have on me amen i don't want your blood to be on me amen when god amen when i when god tells me to say something amen now son of man watch this now son of man i am choosing you this is god now speaking to ezekiel directly and telling him i am choosing you to be a watchman for the family of israel you know and i'm sure brother wade could probably say the same thing i didn't i i never thought that i would be a minister i never and even even in prepping this this sermon this sermon last night i woke up this morning i said i don't want to preach this you don't you don't you don't want you know to to tell the people and and and tell them to think on their ways no you like for people to be able to come back and say that was a great message and rub you you know all you know but but but you know what sometimes that can't happen especially when there's nonsense going on and you know what nonsense is going on in your life i don't know you see but this is the whole council of god amen amen now son of man i'm choosing you to be a watchman for the family of israel if you hear a message from my mouth you must warn the people for me i might say to you these evil people will die then you must go warn them for me if you don't warn them and tell them to change their lives those evil people will die because they sinned but i will make you responsible for their deaths amen but if you do warn the evil people to change their lives and stop sinning and if they refuse to stop they will die because they sinned but you have saved your life it's clear as mud right now who can argue with that oh that's just only for the old testament jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen right that's right it's it's no no that's just only for israel god was the only talking to no the whole council of god is the word of god you've got to see christ from genesis to revelation amen and that word applies to us in this hour saints amen don't think of somebody amen when somebody's really in love amen trying to tell you and warn you amen hey watch your way stop doing this what are you what's going on dude what people end up doing is just getting upset they don't and you know what that is that's pride what's pride when you don't recognize your folly because you don't want to bow down to the person not bow down but submit to the person that's telling you you're falling right what if god sent that person to you what is it that why is it you know let's look for example at david when nathan came to him and told him about his fault about what he had done what if nathan what if dan what if uh uh david would have reacted with i'm not listening to you don't tell me what to do i could do whatever i want to i could go sleep with more women if i wanted to and and murder more if i wanted to david would not have gotten to the place where he where he got he softened his heart and he and he knew that that was the lord talking amen he recognized the word amen that was directly to him i believe god i really honestly believe god is speaking through us it's not coincidence that brother waves bring bringing these these these scriptures amen to us amen it's for us to reflect and to look at ourselves amen and to think amen where am i at in this hour because i don't think we have much more time saying and the time that we have left here amen it's the grace of god and the mercy of god to you to fix things in your life wherever they're wrong you know what it is don't pat it don't pet things and don't baby things when you know that you need to get rid of them in your life amen praise god i had to do that myself the other day listen i'm telling on myself there's things amen that i had to i had to think wait a second i want my daughters to go this way to walk this way as a father right i want my daughters to look at this example but i'm not doing exactly what i want with the i would want for them to do in this certain area that i would that i'm talking about god knows what it is now i as the father have to lead as an example and if you want your children to see a man an example in your life and to go a certain way you have to model that for them you have to be the model for that because that's all they know is you as their as their parent until they get older and get the holy ghost themselves i had to come to that conclusion myself as a parent amen because they're looking for you they're looking at you i have i have been called out by my own children and said papi you're telling us to do this but why are you doing this amen sure what what what are you supposed to say to that what in the you know and and you know what as parents some of us we don't want to we don't want to lower ourselves to our children and say honey you're right you know you are absolutely right and i believe it's god talking to you no we just get mad at them go to your room yeah right yeah yeah you don't talk to me like that you're grounded for a week well let's [Music] [Laughter] god uses our children to talk to us i believe that with all my heart and i think the younger they are the more they even talk to you [Laughter] amen so uh proverbs 22 3 the bible says a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself see but the simple pass on and are punished you see a prudent man looks ahead looks wait a second this ain't right in my life this is and does something about it doesn't let it just grow and fester and continue amen and you know and you know you do something about it and the but the simple pass on and are punished in other words the ones that don't think on their ways they're good they're gonna they're going to receive the uh the uh the the consequences of that of those things is this simple enough for us amen praise god isaiah 58 1 that brother wade has been reading i think this is wonderful too cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and show my people their transgressions this is to isaiah now to ezekiel he was telling him the same thing and to isaiah he's telling him the same thing amen right amen jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and listen show my people their transgression and the house of jacob their sins that's that's for us too amen why is it that god put a faithful ministry for us we don't have old testament prophets like they had back then you know we have prophets that's part of the the but why is it that god gave us a five full ministry amen to warn us right for the perfection of the saints amen and you're only going to be perfected by the word amen that there's they're speaking that it can't be contrary to the word amen it's got to be it's got to be go with the word it's got to go with the message and if if you are not perfected it's not god's fault if your word doesn't perfect you instead when the word goes forth you get mad and you draw that preacher and he's like he's not one of my favorite preachers anymore yeah you know you're out of the circle no because he preaches on me too much then you're not letting the word perfect that's between you and god amen see as ministers all we do is cast out the net all right that's all we can do amen we cast out the net now jesus typed the net as the with the word and that is the word we just cast out the word amen we want to go fishing i'll go with you fishing someday [Laughter] but we want to go fishing spiritually i was talking to the brothers there in nicaragua in honduras i stay in touch with them all the time the young brethren and they are all of them are ministers most of them and they are so um they want this thing to just go away so bad because within their they got counties uh their own count they can't some of them can't even not even leave their own counties they got them in lockdown so much and in so many restrictions that they can't even go they have to show their ids to to be able to go from one place to another i mean like it's it's it's it's bad so we don't we can't complain here i see people still at the restaurants i still i still see people still shopping for clothes i see these people got it bad and they tell me and they're so used to being out preaching the gospel and and missionary work that's all their life that's their life young people and and and they tell me oh brother luis i can't wait for all this to lift up i want to go back and preach the gospel so bad i want to i want to talk to the people i want to see the brothers and sisters in this area again amen i i you know and i feel the same way too amen i've not been back in the mission field now it's been about over a year now over almost two years i want to go out and and spread that net you see but thank god you know we have other platforms that we can do it amen but as ministers that's what we do now we are not responsible for what comes up on that net in that net sometimes you know you're fishing for fish but but sometimes you get terrapins and you get snakes and you get crabs and you get all kind of bugs and all spiders and all kinds of different things i can't help that and you know what the the the all those animals they're all jumping in and in there in the net and you know and they're they're having a good time under that word all of them oh it feels good to be all under the word amen and jumping around and shouting and that's all wonderful and good but eventually they'll show their true colors they'll get out from under the net and get away and even the fish there's fish that will do the same thing too they'll jump in and and you know and and shout and and all these things while they're under the net you know but eventually them being make believers they look like fish like true fish eventually they'll come out from under the net too but the true fish amen the true fish will submit to the net to the word amen and we'll get carried with the word amen and be used for the master's purpose this has this has to do a lot with submission saints submitting ourselves to the word amen how are we going to be perfected through the word that's preached through the five-fold ministry it's not the five-fold ministry that perfects you it's the word that they preach so when you're coming against the the the faithful ministry or when you're or when you just say they're just meddling or they shouldn't be in my business they're being nosy and all this kind of stuff you're coming against the word if the word is preaching in your life and you're there squirming and and and and blowing up like a toad you know then it's the word that's discerning that in your life it's not the preacher if the preacher doesn't live with you take that for what it's worth and think about it again maybe this is not what you were expecting you were expecting for us to talk about god's peace and god's reassurance amen we need to hear these things too amen amen praise god saint so those those fish submitted amen the church has to be run by the holy spirit amen and if you have the holy spirit in your life again you're going to produce fruit in your life god's fruit not your own fruit we are to bear fruit not we don't produce fruit we are to bear fruit amen we don't produce fruit amen see whatever a tree is whatever that life is in that tree that's the kind of fruit that's going to come out of that tree you see that's the reason why i don't have so you don't have to ask certain people what they believe or what or what they you know what their ideas are or what they'll just it'll just come out of them it'll just come out of them you can see it that doesn't have to be a rock a rock star or a rapper or anything like that you can see it even in the church what people are like what people what what people really are you just see it especially by the way they talk and by the way they carry themselves you can see what they do and don't do amen amen praise god brother brown says here and the message the brothers could bring this up why some people can't keep the victory there's a lot of things i got from this message so you just go back and read that message amen and brother branham we will just we'll just tell you the same thing i'm telling you now notice now the church doesn't need a polishing it doesn't need a facelift and it needs a birth it needs a conversion something's got to happen not just to strengthen our borders not to bring new members a revival is not to get new members a revival is to revive what we got that's what we so badly need amen we have the word right we have we have the the we got the doctrines lined up everything we can explain them away but what does that matter if you don't know how to treat your wife at home if you don't know how to treat your husband at home if you don't if you kids don't know how to obey your parents what does it matter that you could explain daniel 70 weeks to the t and all these things as as good as those doctrines are and we need them i'm not discounting them so don't don't don't misunderstand me we need that but if you don't know how to treat your wife at home amen and respect her and and and and and see her for for what god has given her to you amen something's wrong with your life see we feel we got we got this comfort this the security blanket over us that you know we hear the word we come and we listen to the word here and when brother wade believes the word and brother dale preaches the word but but you know what saints that we shouldn't use that as a security blanket the real christian life is what the life that we live at home at church is easy to be a christian at church is easier to show something that you're not right and to dress the part and to even talk the part but it's at home and it's at your job at the things that you do on a daily basis on your personal life that shows who you really are amen or or what is it that you're really feeding on amen praise god brother branham here talking about about a revival you know and and we look at a lake or an ocean amen when those waves are moving and when those waves you know that water amen that lake or that ocean has no more water in it right than when it's moving amen then when it started or when it stains still yeah it's the same amount of water you see amen see god has given us a a certain amount of water in our lives amen he's giving us word amen and that and when the wind starts blowing the pentecostal wind the the the winds of the word amen when they start blowing through it's going to shake amen that in you that word that you've already heard and cause a revival in your life amen see i believe that that the other day when we had when we had the the wonderful services that we had with brother brother andrew glover amen and and and i believe god was in our midst amen in a powerful way and we saw things that we definitely needed to have them amen praise god but you know what if you are if you are doing those things and there's no word in you amen then it's it's nothing amen but when the word is in you amen and you're and you're and you're rejoicing in the word and man running down the aisles or whatever amen and you're rejoicing in it amen there's no condemnation i mean the word is in you amen that that's what that right there that word just revives the word more and causes you to act amen praise god i believe all of us we need that yes we need we need those with those things sometimes we just get too comfortable over there in the corner right you know yeah preacher brother dale yeah amen and then and then when something like that happens in our midst an evangelist comes in and stuff like that we don't we don't know what to do yeah oh my goodness he's he's preaching too fast he's you know amen it's the fatherful ministry that's right we all need amen amen praise god and so see that that those when those waves are moving that's a revival to us amen praise god and it what is a revival a revival a lake has waves and the ocean has waves in order to take the trash out from the ocean that's the reason why the waves move and the ocean moves and the lakes move is to take the trash out that's the reason why we need revivals in our lives amen not not necessarily that you need to jump shout and scream and stuff like that but you need to i mean look into yourself and examine yourself if you look and examine your life amen i believe the fact that you're doing that that's a revival within itself you see if the word causes you to do that and not just to look at yourself and say i do need to do this but you don't do anything about it then that that's not that's not going to get anywhere it's not enough just to acknowledge it's when you acknowledge and do amen acknowledge and do make a change in your life so that your family can see it so that others can see it amen praise god hebrews 12 1 says let us lay aside every weight and the sin amen wherefore seeing we also are compassible with so great a cloud of witness let us lay us out of our way every way and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us [Music] god didn't say there that uh that i'm going to lay aside your weight and your sin that no he said for you to do it you've got to do it i can't do it for you god can't do it for you see the word says it so you do it amen amen praise god amen it's like that goldsmith amen that goldsmith that's beating that gold amen beating that gold amen he bleats it he beats it and then he turns it over and he beats it all on the other side amen until he sees his own reflection and very man the word is never the word is not always going to be nice and pretty and and and it's you know you're going to say amen to it all the time you know it's going to be harsh sometimes but that's the word jesus was is the exact same way amen he said he talked about the beatitudes and when we think about the beatitudes when he preached the sermon on the mount we think that oh my he's you know he's he's just telling the people you know in such a you know kind of like a intellectual way you know and he's talking to them amen and we receive that we love the beatitudes but we hate it when he comes in there and takes a man and he starts knocking things down and because he's jealous of the word that's being broken we don't like that too much we don't like that jesus we like the jesus that's soft and kind amen but we need both of them we need both of them in order to shape our lives amen praise god amen so in order to take out the the the gold is beat amen amen that word beats you in order to take out the pyrite the copper and the dross out of that gold before it can be used amen praise god um see saying sometimes you know we're so we're so loyal we're so loyal to to our our our country we're so patriotic and we're so you know and i believe you should you should be patriotic you should be you should you should love your country and you should love for what it stands for and stuff like that amen but there's so much loyalty to those things and i like what brother aaron says you know you you you're fussing and you're stewing about politics and and you're talking about i'm a more of a republican i'm i'm a conservative and all these and you and you're just gun-ho about it i'm a conservative i stand with with president trump trump 2020 you know and and you're not gun hoe about the word the one that really loves you trump is not going to change anything neither is biden and you can see what just happened yeah trump trump can't fix anything no god's the one that fixes things and and you're gun hoe about posting it on facebook 24 7 and you're there posting your politics when that's not going to change people the changes people is the word amen what is beneficial to somebody is the word the eternal word that's what changes i'm you you know it's fine you can be you could be uh but you know i i i love my country i love colombia i love where i was born and grew up in and part of my life but hey man i'm a citizen of another country amen and i'm going to look to that i'm going to post about that right i'm going to that's what i'm going to i'm going to talk about much more than any of these things that are perishing brother like brother aaron said you're just arranging the the the the furniture in the titanic it's going to sink the titanic's going to sink and you're talking about republican versus democrat here and there all you're doing is just arranging the furniture eventually it's going to sink it's sad to see our country go that way but the bible says that it would go that way so why are we trying to be just so gung-ho and say my rights it's my right you know yeah what about god's rights the rights that it's in the word and yet you don't know anything about it when somebody asks you about the word you don't know what is the new birth i don't know i just go to lula see when a preacher starts preaching that way we're just call meddling we're told that we're meddling where you shouldn't begin in my business and all those types of things and and now you shouldn't be doing that but jesus did it and and and brother brown did it many times too didn't call out people by name no but he called out that sin amen i use that as my example yeah those are my examples amen amen see if the word of god gets all up in your business it makes you squirm and stuff hey man it needed to do that that's right see satan doesn't like to be exposed satan you know what the times when brother branham would be exposing satan in people's lives they'd get all squirmy and you know satan doesn't like to be exposed amen i hope this is exposing satan in in some of our lives including my life i can say saints i i'm not where i i would like to be amen but i i i want i i know that i'm not what i used to be but i know that there's a place that i want to be a man and i'm striving and achieving amen day by day to do that praise god we should just say when somebody is preaching like this and calling things out amen is is is god you love me so much that that brother up there doesn't know what what doesn't know anything and i believe it's god speaking to you no amen instead you just get upset mad and angry at the brother it's not even the brother's fault [Music] amen you draw him out of your circle you don't want no it's not my favorite preacher anymore no that's amen praise god i'm trying to skip a lot some of these things mark 6 i mean if you read mark 6 where jesus was was uh in his own country in his own country to want to minister to the people to want to uh do good for the people to want and in his own country because people knew him and they were comfortable with him isn't this uh joseph's son and and he's a carpenter and he's mary's son um you know yeah you know where did it's all right what's he's listening to what he's saying it's okay you know but i'm still gonna go over here and do my own thing afterwards you know and and still you know and the bible says there that the people there in that country were offended at him we're offended at jesus miracles taking place everywhere else and all kinds of wonderful things taking place but in his own country he didn't have nothing hardly going on the bible says there in in mark chapter 6 that the people were offended at him and he jesus could not do many great works actually no great works in that city he said it says except he only laid his hands on a few people and healed him now i wander saints because of our disrespect and our and our in our in our uh the way we look at the ministry and the way we look at people we're so we're so comfortable with one another and we disrespect one another so much that god cannot do many great things amongst us it happened in jesus life and could it happen in our life because we're so comfortable with each other we mistreat one another by the way by the things we say to each other the way we act towards each other the way the way we're so we're so neglectful about our attitudes towards each other and you don't understand that that's hindering god's move in our lives think about that saints going forward amen is my life hindering god's move or is it drawing god's move amen i want to draw god's move in my life i want to see people be delivered not just he not just healed physically i want to see people be delivered spiritually and are you asked the question is it me that's causing these people to not be delivered is it me that is causing young people to not come in and be born again have a true new birth in their life we thank god for the ones that have come in recently and we thank god for what god's doing in each one of them and i believe god's doing the work in every one of our young people but we as adults we as we we need to show we need to be salty before them and if they see that we're disrespecting one another and mistreating one another and mishandling each other amen that's gonna that's gonna cause them amen that's not that's gonna hinder the moves of god don't say no no it's just god that does it all no yes he does it all amen but we also have something a part to play in that as well that's right our attitudes amen we'll we'll shape things whether for the negative or the positive your attitude towards the word amen praise god so so um brother branham in that message and i like that he talked about the old skins and the new skins amen the wine skins amen and and and the old one jesus said that if you put wine in old wine bottles amen they new wine they would burst they would burst why is that well it's because the old wine bottles they don't have oil see old and old skins don't have oil they don't have you know the thing that would allow the the skin to stretch the more you put wine in there the more it should be stretched it should be stretching but he said that if you put good wine new wine in new bottles amen even old bonding new bottles it's going to be the skin is going to stretch in other words that skin because it has oil in it the oil from the from the animal baby it's going to allow it for it to be flexible and saints that's the thing if we have the life of god in us the way we say that we do the way you should as a christian believer of this end time message should when the word of god is preached and that wine amen that stimulation amen is going forth behind the pulpit amen you should be able to make way for that amen and say god i want to allow more of this in my life in order to change me amen because as that wine expands inside that new skin amen it's causing a change that skin isn't the same from where it started you see but because we are we don't have the holy spirit in some of us in our lives we don't have the holy ghost in our life we're just church comers amen we're going to end up just bursting and the whole wine amen just goes to waste and so does the skin amen in other words what you've already heard just goes to waste because you don't allow the holy spirit to mold you in in in in your life the way you should praise god amen amen and so look what look at first john chapter three give me about five more minutes first john chapter 3 says verse 21-22 because your prayers they are not going to be answered when you're in disobedience to the word they're just not i mean this is what john says beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence towards god and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight now you know if you're pleasing the lord or not see in verse 21 it says beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward god if you have con if you have condemnation for about the things that you do in your home and the things that you allow in your home and those types of things if that condemns you but you don't do anything about it that's between you and god rest assured god is not going to listen to your prayers because there's condemnation in your life now there's a way to get out of that and say lord i'm getting rid of that in my out of my life i'm taking that in my life amen for the example of my children for the example of my wife for the example of my of the church family amen and i'm not going back to that again because i want i don't want my prayers to be hindered anymore that's what it says is that what it says and whatever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight amen it reminds me of of when joshua uh was fighting the battle there the amorites and it was when moses was still uh with his hands raised up and aaron and er were on each each arm trying to keep his hands raised up but every time that moses lowered his his arms amen the people the israelite people would would start losing the battle but every time he would raise his hands back up the people amen would start winning the battle and out there in the battle was the holy spirit joshua out there fighting with them because the bible said that he would be with us even in us amen and joshua was hearing the word from moses the word of the lord came to moses and joshua got that word and gave it to the people and said this is what we need to do in order to keep fighting and win this battle amen and the bible says there in verse 14 of that chapter that that god that day fought their battles for them fought that battle for them but i thought it was the israelite people fighting it was it was there it was they were fighting but because they were all in submission all in order all doing exactly what the prophet said all doing exactly what joshua was telling them to do the lord stepped in and fought their battle right amen amen because they were all in order what happened on the day of pentecost they were all in one accord and the holy spirit did the rest of it when you do your part god will do his but when you don't do your part and you're slacking and doing your own thing adding your own ideas your own intellectuals into it and think that you can get away with things you know and on the verge of going into the world and all kinds of stuff you better believe it god's not going to hear your prayer god's you're hindering yourself and you're hindering those around you amen brother branham says here with this quote i'm finishing and the same message why some people can't keep the victory let us bow our heads while we think of the other what is it maybe you've been a church member for a long time but do you really have do you say i've got to quit this i've got to do this is that the way you operate look what brother brown said that's intellectual that's intellectual but is is there something in you is there something in you the real love of god in your heart if it isn't why don't you accept it today why would you accept a substitute have all that you got to know that you're a christian because you belong to a church it is all you've got to know you're a christian it's because you're you've shouted all you got to know that you're a christian because you spoke with tongues see i believe all these things but i've seen witches and wizards speak in tongues all that you've got to believe maybe you've got oil in your hands or a bloody face you know brother branham keeps going he says he says brother you're miserable yes why not you take the real why take a substitute when the pentecostal skies are full of the real why take a substitute saints why take a substitution of just going to church and i i listened to brother dale and my brother dale preaches the word and i know that i'm okay because i i go up there to that church that's not that won't save you you need an experience with god yes you have to have your own experience with god we appreciate everything in the ministry here uh definitely but brother dale can't do no more to you if you don't listen to what he's trying to tell you brother wade can't help you if you don't listen to the word that he's trying to preach it's got to be your decision that's the reason why god made us free moral agents you're going to advance with god or are you going to just stop god's going to keep moving the bible says if we walk in the light as he is in the light because he's constantly walking he's alive word and if you're there walking in the light in that word amen then that word will fight your battles that word will change you from the inside out saints god bless you i trust that this helped you spark something in you amen to listen look at yourself and examine your personal life and say god where am i with you really truly where am i am i just a church goer am i just one that just says i believe the message and it's like coming to a club or something like that no am i really a born-again christian the way the bible says amen amen god bless you all let's stand to our feet musicians come praise god i don't know if you know that if we know this little this little verse we'll just sing it you pick it up sister esther if you don't if you don't know it but it goes do you have it do you have it do you have it like the bible says do you have

clap of praise hallelujah if you really want something amen you're going to seek it you're going to you're going to find a way to get it if you're really thirsty amen you're going to find somewhere to get water you're going to go you're going to go out of your way to do it and that's the same thing with the things of god if you really want it you're going to do something about it but if you really don't but just leave it aside move on with my life but you're it's going to end up in death amen praise god brother boyd we'll sing one more greater c women greater is he that is he that is in me

it amen god bless you saints keep us in your prayers continue to pray for these ones continue to pray for sister peggy pray for brother dale as well i'm sure that it it's hard on him as well but he's
