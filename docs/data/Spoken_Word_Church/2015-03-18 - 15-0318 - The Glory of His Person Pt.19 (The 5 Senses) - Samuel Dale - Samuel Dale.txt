the church is a whole lot cleaner and make sure that you try to park over that way as many as we can in the grace and kind of fix them we'll have the deacons to be out there and they can direct you as to where to park and the things like that and take care of it also we may have to do some seating because some of the other and another churches said theyve probably come the one from mville so maybe we'll have more than we've had we still have the downstairs that we can do with the big screen we can take care of that but just remember that all right remember all the things that's going on and

all we announced make sure that you get here on time if you want your seat you better get here before anybody else sits down in it you know and we may have to push together a tad bit instead of staying arms length from each other for one service you could set close you know and that'll that'll help all right okay Revelations 1 Genesis 3 and 2 Corinthians 11 we want to try to carry on our thought from this past Sunday uh that we were doing uh sister Susan said we had a sex education class this past Sunday so we may try to continue it on you know a little tonight okay all right we did that one time with the girls and now maybe we just do it with everybody maybe we all need it all right father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us Lord thank you for all things we love you and we thank you most of all for loving us because if you didn't love us it wouldn't do us any good to love you CU Your Love came first you loved us and you died for us we believe you and we thank you we ask you now to just come and speak to our hearts as to what to say to your people and may we be gathered tonight together around you which is the word we love you and we thank you forgive our sins and cleanse us remember the sick among us remember your promise that you sent your word and healed us and we believe it father keep us now in your grace and love in Jesus name amen revelation Ians 1 that we've been reading verse 12 and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one lik un to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the paps with a golden girdle now let's go to Genesis and we'll go to chapter three we will not be getting into necessarily a lot of the natural because I want to make sure we understand what we're talking about cuz everybody's preached to you what happened in the garden you know you should be enough to believe that and as adults talk about it but I want to make sure we understand really the whole situation so Genesis 31 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman y hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden remember he's talking to her now she starts preaching and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God ha said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons all right now let's go into second Corinthians 11 we'll go with verse two for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as Chase ver as a Chase virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent serpent begal Eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said we want to try to continue our thought on the kind of the style that we were talking uh Sunday and getting to a place to to understand and I went back and and viewed most of that service this afternoon to try to pull my mind back in to a thought and uh I would hope you would listen to it and uh you know review it because that's what we make them for and then that way you wouldn't be well I don't know what he means well if you listen you can pretty well tell what I mean that's that's one thing I've noticed that I am very very blunt now in the basis of the way I say things and and uh it's done for that purpose that you and I should not be deceived now we think about ourselves oh I can't be deceived I'm a predestinated seed well just remember there are also some that are predestinated under rep probation so you might want to make up your mind which side you're own and remember that if you reject the word then you prove which sides you're on I mean no problem if we reject the word we prove what we are okay so then that would would run into that Rim all right but now did you follow what I was trying to say I hope you did through the message our Sunday afternoon especially when we were talking about that Eve was made per perfect she was not made in in a way like we think I've heard the people of the message express it and listening to them that that you know it looks like they're trying to say that brother brandham even said you know that Eve was made a certain way and them describing Eve making a certain way would mean that God made her a certain way so she would fall well now I don't agree with that because if he made her in any form whatsoever in a wrong way then he cannot judge her for being wrong I hope you get that embedded into your mind you know to understand because that would make God the author of the the the part being wrong and that can't be it was the way he would have to make her as perfect and then give her a choice and her choice would would bring the downfall of that but we want to try to put it on a basis in our thinking that there was something wrong well if you're going to do that then uh we might as well forget it eat drink and be married cuz tomorrow we die forget it you know but to think about it maybe you've heard heard it maybe that's the way you think you know maybe you think that a way maybe that's the reason I'm trying to nail it down so hard because I want you to at least know where I stand then that way you can do what you want to what you believe right all right because if Eve was made in any form wrong right then you can't judge her for being wrong amen right all right and remember it's so beautiful that she was not even taken I know everybody wants to use that byproduct I know what brother brandom is saying about it that she was not in the original creation but remember she was in him in Adam in the original creation well you don't hear that you don't hear people talk about how she was in Adam you just hear them talk about she wasn't in you women y'all wasn't in original creation but makes yall a byproduct and like I say and I put it on every tape when I mention it go home get your Dictionary look up byproduct I don't have to look it up I know what it means well maybe you ought to read a little bit about the prophet maybe you ought to run in some of the things that he says like I was looking at one and I'd be glad to look these up for you if you question me on it because looking at one there the other day where he was talking about and he said see said she was in Adam in the original creation but said she was not made her own Identity or person he said she was a byproduct but a byproduct means that that product came from Adam well like I said Sunday I ain't put it in there I was listening I was laughing in my own ways I guess but you know we think about Eve be Adam being male and female so I guess the rib that was taken out of Adam was a feminist rib all the rest of them was masculine you remember that Sunday I I try to make those points to get you to think you know and if Eve was made wrong she came from Adam that's right that's right then that make Adam created wrong you see that it doesn't pan out it won't work but we think we have it all figured out because it we never knew about these things until the prophet came right then once we heard what he said then we conclude that we've got it figured out now you know and then we can take all that Old Testament Bunch back there and say well look back there woman wouldn't even count it back there she wouldn't even recorded she would nothing she did well you know they must have had pretty good the idea too you know what I mean right I don't see how that you could I love my wife and I wouldn't do anything at all to harm her you know and and if I would love my wife like that do you think if I was in the old test I'd treat her any different I kind of like sometimes what I view and all and I know it's not good but I remember seeing in a movie one day and they were talking about this this uh chief of the tribe or something or something and then I can't remember the whole story cuz it doesn't matter but the point is is what he said the guy that was talking to him said you don't have one wife and said you're allow polygamy he said my wife don't like that idea well I thought that pretty good you know well evidently he loved his wife and didn't want to act that way but see we we want to make make it something to where that we've got it figured out and and we think we know the story so we try to back it background it and build it up with our own thoughts and ideas but if Eve was made in body wrong she can't be judged if she was made made in spirit wrong she can't be judged if she was made in Soul wrong she can't be judged all right amen and Adam the Bible says was not deceived all right and whether you listen to what I was saying or not remember they wouldn't have been no Adam and Eve if the minute Eve sinned right the second she sinned she would have been annihilated right right but how come she wasn't annihilated I mean naturally why wasn't she annihilated because the Bible said that he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world cuz he knew what he was going to do he knew Eve would sin and go wrong he knew that right all right and in knowing that then he would have it prepared as a covering for her amen right right you see we don't we don't listen we don't think a lot of times but understand what I'm trying my best to bring to you Eve was Body Spirit and soul Eve body coming from the rib of Adam right spirit and soul coming from almighty God the same as Adam was Body Spirit and soul body by creation spirit and soul coming from God made him Adam then God breathed in his nostrils and he became a living Soul an eternal person that's right well I told you Sunday whether you agree or whatever you going to do uh I believe Eve was the same way cuz what are you going to do that's right I proved I think my point to where brother Randon said that Eve was still in theophany right the part of Adam that's right all right now you can go all the way back you can get a lot of quotes from brother brandham because I was looking at them today for a moment there that he speaks of Adam and Eve being the same person yep amen and just divide it out then it becomes Adam and Eve but just remember when they were divided out it become Adam and Eve all right then she was the byproduct yeah she came from Adam but her soul and her spirit didn't come from Adam it come from God Amen all right so then we've got to leave it that way are we going to have to go into some other form or something to try to understand but now you follow me if we can see remember the background now what the background of all of this is man made in the image of God you remember if we can see what the man is we know what God is if we can see what God is we know what the man is because it's the same image all right now I believe that if we look at Eve in the right understanding and that's what I was trying to bring out Sunday and to see what went wrong with Eve we can see what's going wrong with us I mean that's the only way I can explain it is to look and see what went wrong with Eve and then I can look look and see what WR went wrong with you and I or is going wrong with you and I and I hope to Heaven I know I said it in there a couple of times I hope to Heaven that you never get so super religious until you think that you don't do wrong that's right cuz you know where that I can quote from Brother brandham when they said do you sin he said every day that's right but yet right above there he said he lives so close to God he forced the gift to work what about a man living that close but yet admitting where he was at what about the great Apostle Paul when he was speaking of life and man and he comes out he said of Sinners I'm Chief oh that was before well you talk to Paul about it no he said he was Chief you remember the old Indian that brother random laid a lot of emphasis on after me receive holy ghost in me two people one does good other one does bad white dog black dog which one wins Chief want I feed the most Paul said what the things I do I would not the things I want to do I can't do them I'm all tied up in this situation he said well then from the inward man I serve the law of God but from the outward man I serve the law of the flesh just don't ever get it into your mind that you're so super religious until you don't do wrong right because I'll show you if you'd like this I was looking at it today brother Brown said eve thought she was right he said and the church thinks she's right is any way to convince the church they're wrong I don't care where you want to call them uh Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Catholics or branhamites or Lula ites right you know what people that get in their mind that they're right you're not going to change them I was thinking about it as I was talking about Eve being the first woman preacher and I said and she was anointed now brother Brown said that's why you can't I knowth that not he said you can't tell that woman it's wrong for her to do them things he said cuz she's anointed you go tell a woman preacher she ain't called to preach you know what brother brandom said one day he said I'm not going to tell you that God didn't call you now come on you don't need to quote he said but it's not in his word amen that's right right well you know what he just laying it right back in your La said all right you going to take the word you're going to take what you believe and I'm anointed you think you can convince preachers that they're wrong I've tried it for years and failed on every one of them so I just put it that way all right you said well what if you're wrong well okay I'm wrong no problem now what you going to do about it see that's your choice all right but now look let's get into the thought now with a background that we had of trying to bring of how Eve was not made wrong she was made correctly and how that Satan would look at her body and I emphasized that Sunday that he looked at her body he couldn't find any inroad because according to the scripture sure the body without the spirit is what dead all right so there no problem there so we need to get away from that bodily thoughts we have right cuz your body sisters brothers can't you you can't function on any form without something motivating you in natural life or what kind of life you want to make it so it's not the body the problem n that's right the body you remember how I was trying to bring that the body only displays the it's uh what is sin sin is not drinking gambling smoking run around with women what that's attributes of unbelief the body only displays what something motivates that to do all right so then you're going to have to go inward to find out where the problem is at so I order to do away with the fleshly things that we can all just thing that's oh well we we know know now wasn't eatting no apple well we got that well you know what I've told it and I don't mind keeping on telling it my mom told my daddy that they ate an apple in the garden and he laughed at her and he told her what happened now I don't believe he was a prophet I'm just saying he had common sense if you want to learn a little bit about what happened in the garden just go down and buy your Playboy magazine somebody in that realm has come up with a lot of things with snakes and women and all kind of things ain't going to gra no okay you're so super religious I was sitting down there one day in an office in a little cubicle thing and I was preaching on the pyramids and most of you heard me say it and I don't mind saying it I'm telling it for the truth and this man this buddy of mine he said he said I got to play boy magazine got an article on the pyramids I said bring it and let me read it so I was sitting in the boss's office and most of the time I didn't do a whole lot cuz boss didn't know what we was doing and he had to depend on me so you know I got a lot of setting around reading time and if brother collie was here he aen it cuz I stayed up in the tire backing with him about half the time me and him talking about the Lord but this other man right next boy he come over and he looked over in that thing and oh the preachers got the Playboy magazine come here everybody this was a white guy the black guy was when that brought it to me he didn't gently explain it to the guy he grabbed that guy and shoved him against that office and he said I brought the Playboy magazine to him there's an article in there on what he's preaching on and you shut up you know nobody never mentioned that again sure I mean he did if Tom was here he could tell you who the guy was and that that done it and how the guy told him said Sam's a great guy I wasn't care about the Playboy magazine I was interested in any article I could find upon those things and there was some good written news in there all right but see we can be so super religious until we become forget it all right but we seen that Eve was made perfect her body was made perfect not Eternal perfect her spirit was made perfect not Eternal I believe her soul was made as Eve perfect but not Eternal then God gave her through the nostrils eternal life as he did Adam cuz you can prove Adam was in blasphemia names all right now but in doing that then you see where that as we tried to cover it where brother brandham said that he took the spirit part of the feminist from Adam and put it into Eve all right then those things he began to talk about them as being the uh senses of the spirit Realm as I told you Satan was looking at her and trying to figure out some way to enter the human race but yet he couldn't do it he looked her over real good he couldn't figure out anything and all at once he began to see something not that God made her spirit wrong I emphasize that over and over Sunday God didn't make her spirit wrong he didn't make her body wrong he didn't make her soul wrong he made it perfect but as the point of where that you take from what was taken from Adam not his spirit because you'd leave him without a spirit but it was the feminist part that would make Eve to be what she would be and her desires and things would be to be a mother she would have those instincts dwelling within her and she'd already been told in spiritual Parts in Adams they were told to multiply replenish the Earth am she knew the story in a part but she didn't understand how it could be brought forth right and Satan he begins to reason get her to reason he begins to deal with her emotional side he begins to talk with her about these things not physically touching her in contact but to deal with her from the inside all right just like I told you Sunday girls you you know what I'm women you know what I'm talking about you first accept the man in the brain and I put it in there cuz I try my best to be so explicit or so blunt to where that somebody can't can't come along and say you did you said that I put it in there and I said I'm not talking about a rape case I'm not talking about a drug given to you and you go do something wrong I'm talking about normal Humanity or normal doings all right cuz I know I'm blunt you know what a a girl that is raped I'll be glad to talk with you out of a service if it's forceful thing she's still a virgin I don't care what you say because I can tie that with every scripture in the Bible no no well then what are you going to say what are you listening so Satan he saw his point that if he could get her to reason if he could get her to working in that emotional side that it would bring into being the motherly Instinct and things that she was made with the spirit coming from Adam as to that that she would have the feminist Spirit about it and that would be what it would be far was to be a mother all right and as it happened then Satan he just slowly gradually talked with her until he got the attention H then we know that he couldn't deal with the body to do anything he couldn't deal with the soul because she had eternal life in her soul so it was dealing in her spirit realm her memory or reasoning we will read a little bit in a minute of what the prophet had to say about Eve and what took place but I want you to think with me about it see we read that L Satan through his subtility his very smartness his very shrewd ability that he had that we would not fall as the scripture says so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ that we be not deceived but I I can't be deceived brother brother I can't be deceived well that's up to you and God but if you turn the word down you're already received that's that's no problem I turn it down that's my doings right all right so then Eve coming from Adam was part of the original creation sure not made as the animals were made you know male and female but made in Adam brother brand said he thought so much of her until he would not go to the dirt to get another clot of dirt to make a body he said the same way with Christ and his church now do we believe that right see then Eve as being in Adam coming from the body of Adam see the spirit coming from God the soul being her person or being or who she is the soul is the real you it's what you are then in doing that let's don't be deceived today I I thought Paul was talking to you and me right right I didn't know he was just talking about Adam and Eve you know I thought he was talking to the church amen amen all right and if he's talking to the church he's talking to ones that are in Christ amen cuz it's the only way you can be in the church is being in Christ he's talking to Born Again Believers sure I know the Corinthian story right they had a lot of problems but you know they did have a lot of truth right they just needed some help that's maybe us Lites need a little help that's right right let's just don't be deceived and being deceived you know what being deceived is you know what it is if a person's deceived they believe they are right or why else would you talk about being deceived they believe they are right right now let's take a little illustration and walk through it for a little bit and let's just see if we're deceived okay us lulaes now not what's on the internet listen that's your business I'm not throwing off on you I'm just saying I'm not your pastor out there I'm the pastor of this church what you listen to me is up to you what you talk about is up to you not up to me don't call me I've had I've turned down people that would call me and say brother Dale I want to know about this I said go to your pastor or go to the prophet's message and I've had them to say this I'd say brother Dale I am a pastor and I've refused to answer their question because that would become me trying to Pastor them I say go to the prophet's message and I said all right now if you are in confidence enough to call me to want to know something then if you will go back a few services to a message call so so and so and so on a date you might find your answer I have done that because that's left up to them that's tried to explain this one time on this situation here we're going to get into to about 25 ministers and some of them begin to realize that they had been deceived remember we're trying to find out what happened to Eve and in doing that is to help us to find out what's happening to us cuz now whether you agree or what you're doing it's up to you see where you're going to put yourself you got to make a decision I know that I require that for you to make a decision I'm sorry not sorry for doing it but I'm sorry that it has to be done that you must make a decision you've got to either decide what I'm saying is right or decide what I'm saying is wrong okay and if you decide it's right then all right and I don't mean I'm ever word right you know now don't we garbage canand with me and I won't be with you I've still got a lot of questions about this message that I don't have the right answer for amen Aaron Roberts back there called me first time he talked to me on the phone he asked me a question I FLT told him I don't know the answer he started laughing and he said I called a man that everybody said had the answerers and he told me that he didn't even know I saidwell why me tell you something that I don't know right all right cuz you see if we find out what happened to Eve we can find out what's happening to you and I now we ain't got to the death yet we're still in the stages coming up the next message the Lord willing will be about how that death comes involved but it's getting you to what's going on all right right in said if we find out what went wrong with Eve we can find out what's going wrong now you say what do you mean by that well we've been around here quite a while amen I think we walked around horb long enough don't you you remember they had about 40 years around horb right amen you take that and lay it down on the mount one time I guess the tick when I think of mankind you lay down on a map the the horb and the position of Israel and they walked 40 years look like somebody would have said we was here last week cuz there's that same rock that I put my ex on surely they had to cross their own tracks many many times walking 40 years even they didn't go with a mile a day that would have been 365 miles and you know that's a lot of mileage all right but now consider it I believe this is to me is one very very important matter that will help us to understand what happened to Eve is what's happening to us cuz now I keep saying it because I I just let there's no quotes from brother brandom says about Eve receiving eternal life not that I found maybe you have but I don't I've come to that conclusion so that's what you say that's what brother Dale has to say about well you tell me what you got to say about it because if Eve didn't have eternal life you can't compare with her right and you can't say God started his church that way and wants to end it that way you're going to change somewhere in the line so I believe Eve had eternal life in her soul I don't ask you to agree with that I just ask you to listen so if she had eternal life in her soul and her body and spirit was not Eternal how many of you claim to have eternal life tonight right amen well your body and your spirit is maybe I said it wrong did I say it right I said the body spirit and soul get it right way it's supposed to be Eve had not eternal life in her body not eternal life in her spirit she had eternal life in her soul by that part of the theophany that was placed within Eve right all right that's exactly where you and I are sitting tonight by the new birth we have eternal life in our soul our body and our spirit is not eternal now do you see the the conclusion of the matter what else can it be we can look at Eve and find out what went wrong and by seeing what she done wrong we can turn against that and try to do what's right now if You' have asked Eve about the time she'd begin there a few days talking and walking around if you'd have said Eve or you deceived no I straightened that old booger out I told him that we couldn't eat a ever tree there was one out there right that we couldn't eat of good woman preacher all right but now here's something that I began to study the message and even back when we didn't have computers to run things we wrote Our Own concordances and done everything we could to try to find you know the connections and put it together what the prophet had said in many different places and that's why if you see my Bible it's got a lot of writing on it you see any of the books that I have they have a lot of writing which is references in one to the other backwards and forth and you know that's a real good thing to do but I realized one day that there was something wrong because I believed Eve had eternal life in her soul and brother brandham would say paraphrasing close enough that Eve sinned in her soul if she's got eternal life how could she do it then we'll get into another point in a minute where brother brandham says do we sin he said every day but then there's another quote right there close to it he says do Christian sin he says no it is impossible now what you going to do you got two sides what are you going to do we're going to flip a coin to see which one's right or we're going to do it by the weight of your matter of how many quotes we got or are we going to try some way to let God reveal that to us to where that it would take away the unbelief amen well it don't matter me whether I guess it don't matter to you where acts 238 Compares with Matthew 28:19 what well it don't matter to me I don't need to well you don't need to understand Matthew 28:19 next 238 you don't need to understand whether it's an eternal hell or not an eternal hell maybe we don't need anything we just need to eat drink and be married remember we've been 40 something years walking around horb right amen but brother brandham in his early Ministry now I've preached this many many many times here over the 40 something 50 years I've been preaching cuz when I saw that that opened a channel to to me that took away all of the doubts and the frustrations of why would this quote be here and this quote be here I I love to see it come together that you don't have to deny neither one of them amen right where he said today was listening to in the truck going down the road where he said I like to take the scriptures and let them come together and make a beautiful picture all right see then as the prophet begins to explain and all the way through his entire Ministry he spoke of a trown being right yeah always spoke of a triun being that is what we were and he said God's a trione being he said he's Father Son and Holy Ghost he said now not a trinity he said and you're not three people he said but you're a tri being and in his early Ministry he'll say that you are Body Soul Spirit but then when he comes on up into the seals and they begin to break to him you can watch him on if you'll really study it you can watch him on greatest battle ever fought and he's he's look like he's moving I studied that message till I could just see him he would he would be like trying to line up something and he was fighting a great battle himself and somewhere along after the opening of the seals he began to preach that it was Body Spirit and soul of the tri being where in his early Ministry he would been preaching on a basis of Body Soul and Spirit all right do you do you need those quotes go ahead with number one then Brothers we'll I'll just read them to you then that way you can't say that it ain't something but watch what he says here in and North it not 1965 he draw a little circle and things and draws the Rings and so forth I'm going to make one ring like this and I'm going to make another ring on the inside of that ring that's two then I'm going to make a ring on the inside of that ring there's three rings three circles now that's you that's God God in a Trinity is One and without a trinity he's not God don't blow your brains out without a triun he's never believed in Trinity right that's God God and a trinity is one and without a trinity he's not God he can't be manifest any other way now he's a triun being not not a trinity of beings right he's a tri being and without a tri own being he can't be cuz remember I spent so much time explaining what if you say that it's Father Son and Holy Ghost three persons you're over here on a Trinity right where did the Oneness go they went over here to one like you finger and one Manifest this that and the other without having the Triune being he cannot be God you're going to be a trinity or Oneness one but yeah we can get all tied up in little wordings now watch neither can you be manifest without being the Trinity person that you are that's Body Spirit Soul without either one of them you're not complete see you didn't have a soul you'd be nothing didn't have a spirit you wouldn't be nothing you didn't have a body you'd just be a spirit not a body so it takes the body the spirit and the soul to make an individual all right now then he used this all the way through the message to explain that the being of a person and what we are in comparison to God and what he is but even though and I'll restate this over and over even though he changes the wording from Soul to Spirit he never changes the senses of that position so the senses of the position gives you the right answer there's five senses to the outside man which is cast field smelling here the second real of man no matter what he called it the five senses of memory reason imagination conscience love and different whatever the five senses now when you read the message and you think there's something wrong that he send in her soul go back and check the senses she sending her memory reason conscience affection the second real so no matter you say well well he needed to correct that and I am certainly quick enough to say I am not smart enough to correct him and you ain't either so we don't worry about that all right because this is not a correction it's a statement he didn't have to explain that over again because he always gave the senses the same the outside Rim five second Rim memory reason conscious the third rim him was always one sense either Faith or doubt right so he didn't have to explain it you know why you know this is Brother Dale okay you know why that was done it was done where people could argue about it what does it say that you baptized name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost but then 10 days later he would say in the name of Jesus Christ that's right now that has deceived the world right that's right you agree that has mixed the world up amen amen that's why when you hear me baptize somebody cuz I heard the prophet say it one day I say to fulfill the Great Commission of Matthew 28:19 to baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost I now baptize thee my brother sister what in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know both of them are saying the same thing right right now you tell me they're not saying the same thing father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ right now here I leave this one for you to explain all right would you accept somebody in the church if they came in here and they saidwell brother I want you to know I was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ NOP NOP got to be Lord Jesus Christ you ain't got no scripture right that's right brother you ain't got no scripture because it said in the name of Jesus Christ read your Bible brother brandham put the Lord onto it to show in Father Son and Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ would you hear him even say said we baptize them people in Christian baptism in the name of Jesus Christ I had some of these people that were here some of you came may not be here now but and they said they was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I said the only one question I ask you I said I accept Jesus Christ because that is Bible but the question I ask you when you was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ was you baptized under regeneration and they said yes cuz see I know they do that they baptize in the name of Jesus Christ under regeneration they baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ under regeneration that's right said you think I need to be baptized again I said I ain't going to tell you what to do but I'm certainly going to tell you in a hurry I would do it well everyone I talked to I baptized them again even though they'v been baptized before because it was what it was the problem under regeneration we don't believe in baptism under regeneration that's right so there's a lot of things that maybe God said through His prophets and his writers that would leave mankind away to argue and that would be what Paul was talking about through the Simplicity that is in Christ Jesus what is the Simplicity is in Christ Jesus father Son and Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ that's simple okay so now what we're talking about using those as example that the prophet in his earlier Ministries up until somewhere in the mid 60s he would basically talk about body Body Soul and Spirit then in his later Ministry he stated what body spirit and soul that don't have to be corrected it has to be understood amen right let's read a couple to make sure that you don't misunderstand me to think that I I don't bring it to you go ahead with number two which is taken P perseverance 1962 uh 218 paragraph 23 through 25 he's talking about faith and things things and he said we have our body and our being here is like a seed and a seed on the outside has a shell inside the shell has a crust or a pup pardon me and inside the pup has a germ that's the way we are Body Soul Spirit now to the body there's five senses c t feel smelling here to the soul there's conscience and so forth five Avenues to it okay the inside is one one Avenue and that Avenue is the same place as that before every man from Adam down to where where we are of self will all right so in 62 what's he saying he's saying Body Soul Spirit okay going up the greatest battle ever fought pick up the next one paragraph 72 uh let's see that's still part of that's part of the other that's where he's telling about the two masters spir go ahead to number number three the greatest battle ever fought he said you'll find out that the outside body has five senses it's contacted by and that is SE taste feel smell and here that's the five senses that control the human body inside of the body is a soul and that soul is controlled by imagination conscious memory reason and affection that's the thing that controls the soul but the spirit is is only has one sense the spirit it either dominates it which is Faith or doubt all right do you see what the prophet is doing but remember what he did do five senses to the body five senses to the second realm to here he calls the soul one sense to what he calls a spirit it only has one all right now let's read number four which is taken from works as Faith Express 1965 now remember you're in a cycle of three but you're one person like Father Son and Holy Ghost cycle of three but one person three attributes of the same God fatherhood three offices like fatherhood sunship and Holy Ghost and you are Body Spirit and soul now the outside body has five inlets to it to contact your Earthly home see taste feel smell and hear and the inside which is a spirit it has five senses conscience and love and so forth but the inside of that the soul as one thing that's where you live see as I say a while ago I believe God allows these things to happen to let people deceive their own selves if you ever talk to a person that believes in Two Souls you you will find out in a hurry it is very valuable to know the difference between Soul and Spirit you remember the Bible plainly tells you that Hebrews 4 and12 that the word of God and who's the word come to the prophet the word of God discerns between Soul and Spirit that's right you know that Paul gets over there and explaining I'll get to it in a minute where he's talking about uh and names it but he doesn't name it in an order form he names It soul body and spirit showing that Paul knew of the trone part of man but in that quote he doesn't say Body Spirit and soul he doesn't say Body Soul spirit he says Body Soul you know it says says soul body Spirit I'm 99% sure I'll find that in the minute cuz I got in my notes all right but you see what he's talking about but you jump back to find out where Eve went wrong go ahead with number five this is taken from the greatest battle ever fought Eve could not sin until she laid aside God's word opening up her channel of reasoning through her soul and begin to reason now come on he's done told you the cerm can't reason is Faith or doubt you see now which one of these do you want I take them all because it gives me a great understanding all right well certainly my husband has never told me these things but I believe that you he told me I shouldn't do this but you know you made it so real now what you may argue with me that Adam and Eve talked why certainly my husband has never told me these things but I believe that you he told me I shouldn't do this sure amen but you know you make it so real and plain I I I believe it would be wonderful because you're making it so plain to me see there was the first battle and through that battle has caused every other war and every Bloodshed that ever be what did she do she disbelieved God's word amen right Eve began to stop number six I just want to make sure I've just given you these most of you know them but but giving them to you where somebody else out there listening they wonder what we believe at Lula we believe what the prophet says but bring it together Eve began to stop to reason when he she quoted the word to him God said you should not eat thereof for the day you eat thereof that day you die and Satan never disagreed with her he said certainly that's right but he said you see you you need new light something a little different from what God Said and if you do do it you'll be just just a little smarter your eyes will be open right on the tug of war pull the whole human race into death because Eve listened to a reasoning against God's word that's a shame that she did but it's done are you following me now said pull the whole human race did Eve listening to reason let's see if he still had that same thought in 1965 go to number seven now I got to check this cuz we got a 7 a okay leave it that way Satan's Eden 65 notice she pulled off the holy Veil to see what sex really was compare that what lust really would do she pulled a veil from off her eyes the holy thing that God had put over her eyes she wanted knowledge to know what it was all about so she pulled a veil off to see what it was all about she listened to the devil and noticed what a place it put her in wanted knowledge knowledge is one of your B thoughts of the spirit you know memory reason conscience affections and things your knowledge comes through your spirit part of you right so it looks like he had the same thought in 65 but what about it what do you see well I don't think it's important well it's not important to get baptized correctly so we just go and do what I want to I'm sorry sorry for being a smart at it but if I save your soul and I die and go to hell I hope I get a drop of water because I'm trying my best to save your soul not your body and not your spirit all right now as I said when we started give me a quick minute Christians sin but a sinner cannot sin because he's a sinner that's taken from adoption in 19 60 but look at him number eight yeah that would be the seven look at number eight questions and answers in 59 do Christians sin absolutely no there is no scripture where a Christian sins he cannot sin I know there's a resentment to that well we'll just go to First John 3 and see what the scripture says a Christian does not sin now where'd he go to did he go to the scripture where it talks about it's impossible for a man to sin because a seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin see the seed remaineth in you and you cannot sin the seed can't sin that's right okay brother R's right in both statements sir he's exactly right in both statements he's explaining that do we sin and let's go on down to the next one while we're on it and you can run it up you can to to number nine says you get that this morning how that we're perfect perfected absolutely spotless and blameless no one sin on us listen are you above Temptation never do you sin every day yes sir but yet we are perfected because we are in him and God couldn't judge us no more than he can judge him now is the Bible right and the prophet right what about it so Eve couldn't Sin from her soul right she sinned in her spirit realm now here's where you ain't going to like so go ahead lock it down a true born again Christian sins in their spirit and not in their soul because they cannot sin in their soul because the seed remaineth in them and they cannot sin that's right that ought to be straight amen well brother Dale do you do wrong every day brother brandom do you sin every day well he he he didn't really mean that he done that to deceive you well he done a good job deceiving me because that fits the rest of the Bible that fits Paul the things I would not I do the things I do not I would that really fits a whole lot of things and then it fits some quotes brother brandham gave of how that in the Bible says Jesus was tempted in all points as we are yet without sin brother rown said he was even tempted of women but he didn't sin it's not wrong to be tempted it's wrong when you yield to the Temptation you can't go nowhere in the world today without naked women in front of you right you go to drive by these churches and look what's going to them wouldn't it be nice one time brother brandham there was a lady came in I'm paraphrasing it so but it's pretty close the lady was didn't have on too good of a and you know what he done he took his coat off and spread it over her legs well he said one time he said I've got a couple of good suits you know well let's say he had two good suits and four bad ones okay that's six suits he's run out in a little while today that's true right spreading over the legs oh you know what that gets a point across whether you th KN it or not it sinks in that's why I do that a lot but do you what do you think a true Christian can't Sin from his soul right no way if you're born again so you got to take it to another realm and you got to realize then that the body without the spirit is dead so then you can't say the body is what done it I just can't help it this old body lust the body don't lust that's right that's right that's right come on it's the inward part of the spirit part of us that Satan is still working on just like he did Eve amen that's right cuz you can't lust with your body without something motivating it amen right so then the center real of mankind I mean the second realm of mankind whether you want to call it Soul or whether you want to call it Spirit just make sure you got your five senses of memory reason conscience affections tied up in there and you find out what Eve done in the garden she listened to the devil's lie contrary to the word of God how many times have I made this statement I'm not going to tell you you can't turn on a tape recorder or computer or whatever and listen to somebody else's Services because that is your choice your free moral agent what have I told you on that though I said you listen to what you want to because that's your business but when you bring it back in this congregation what you've heard brother so and so say that is contrary to brother Dale brother Dale is going to speak out and if any of you go among which I know you do so then I'm exposing that and you talk your little petty feelings and I'm going to preach what I believe is that the way we talk a lot of time I'm going to believe it this way well go ahead and believe it but just remember when you tell somebody else that death is on your shoulders that's amen yes sir I never had any trouble with anybody here I've even told the preachers I said just don't come to this pull pit and preach contrary to me until you sit in my office and explain why that's right then when you explain in my office what's wrong I'll give you the pull pit to explain what you believe but no you can't keep preachers from doing that they're going to put it out they're going to tell you what they believe because they're anointed your anointing can't be different from the word may I quote brother Brandon was listening to him today and he say but but we're anointed he said what does the word say he said then your anointing paraphrasing it your anointing doesn't have anything to do with it and like I've always said you go tell somebody I'm wrong do you realize until you come to me first you wrong and we'll answer to God that's right that's your choice you go tell somebody you at least come tell me I'm wrong I ain't whooped anybody yet because they differed with me why can't we sit down and talk you see what Satan has done through his subtility he deceived Eve through working upon her emotional side through memory reason conscience affections Etc that's right and he caused all of this death next we will cover death and what it is because death is when we turn the word down the Bible says about Cain that what he went out from the presence of the Lord that's when he died because there was no hopes he would not listen what about you and I I believe a Christian can do wrong but as quick as he finds out he's wrong he's going to straighten it up right amen if not may I quote the prophet about the Ramsay that his name the Hebrew Book or Smith Smith R it's in the Hebrew Book where the man wanted somebody to preacher wanted somebody to go get him some beer and bring it and he refused to do it he went out and got his own Ramsey again so many days later which was 10 days 2 weeks or something very short time the man was dead now you can argue over whether or not he was born again I'll just quote the rest of the prophet he said God could not let his child Mar his name so he took him home now you can argue whether he was a born again Christian or where he was adopted manifested son or whether he was lost or whatever he said he took his child home premature death that's it why Paul says to turn people over to the destruction of the flesh that what that the soul may be saved as of by fire right right amen all right I believe a true born again Christian as the prophet said I sin every day that's what he said about himself you say yeah but that's unbelief now the next message will be the clarification of unbelief CU I don't have time 15:09 I I will state it on this way there has to be an unbelief according to the Bible that is unbelief but not under death the Bible says it says there's a sin not unto death but there's a sin unto death and he said I don't I say you don't pray for that sin un death now I'm paraphrasing but it's close enough right see if you know somebody's wrong and you go try to help them and they won't straighten up you stop praying that's right that's right why because let God's hand take it if he's a child it'll straighten enough he's not it between him and God no brother Dale we need to pray for everybody I had that to house happen here and some of you would say well who's going to cast the first stone I'm the guy that's got to cast it I have no choice right because I've got to say what that says and I have no choice it's not that I want to do you think that Peter was sitting over there wouldn't it him when the man come up if you sold this for the property this he said yeah he said you've lied against the Holy Ghost don't you think Peter loved that man he didn't want him to Die the next we'll talk about death and how that the Bible says the woman that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth remember we are the woman right that's just not meaning the females in the crowd Crow us males can get by not exactly do you understand what I'm talking about a true Christian can from their Spirit real of memory reason conscious affections can actually do wrong but understand what I said they won't stay wrong quick as this brought to their attention they'll get straight because we're facing god let's stand come on Brothers evees unbelief but I don't have no unbelief what are you holling about you say but so there must be an unbelief that can even be in the Christian realm but not in their soul but now let's don't lay on that too heavy well I've got it straightened out now it ain't my body that's the problem I used to think I couldn't have it cause my body was made this way so now brother Dale's got that out of the way so now it's my spirit I just can't have it in my spirit maybe we just can't help it anyway go ahead brother uh 41 spiral book wings of the above amen 41 the spiral book anybody have a need think on these things no on the flood many days anybody have a need he
