good time doing it so we always say to you first time welcome glad to have you with us and just make yourself at home amen if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Romans 8 and we'll be reading in Genesis 2 Romans 8 Genesis 2 now remember to pray for I know you have but pray for for Brother Ray Gabriel uh there's not any problem much with his kidneys but there's a blood count keeps activating you know going down or doing something and they want to run some test on it think he's going to do a scan test on it and also just just remember him and keep him in your prayers the reason they're not here she's sister Kathy is having to work some late you know so that makes it hard on them to try to get here but just remember these remember the sick among us and pray that the Lord would bless each and and everyone and keep us all in his love amen Romans 8 and Genesis 2 Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day in your grace unto us we thank you for Calvary we thank you for your love and your understanding we thank you for All Things We Praise Your Great Name and we believe that your word is true that you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so come among us tonight Lord and work your work Among Us and just set your people free and guide each one of us may we all be together as one in you and just forgive our sins make us to be what you want us to be have your way with us now and guide us in Jesus name amen amen Romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose now if you notice it's saying to the called so it's a special group but it's also saying uh you know that uh all things work together for them that love God well that doesn't mean it's going to work for everybody right only who those who truly love God and for those who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he Justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things what is it if God be for us who can be against us right amen let's go over to Genesis now and where we pick up our thought we'll just read a little bit in Genesis 2 uh 7-9 then jump over to verse 177 and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his night noil your breath of life and he became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made he made out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now notice two trees one is the Tree of Life the other is the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil all right now's go look at verse 17 see where the Commandment came verse 16 and the Lord God commanded a man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now now we've been studying for quite a while from here in Romans and thinking about and the topic has been you know how does God predestinate am all right now how does God predestinate see some people think that he predestines because of maybe they're good you know a good people so he predestinated me there's many doctrines world has basically the religious realm is basically split split over the doctrine of predestination you have your your uh calvinistic form which comes forth and brings it on into the Baptist Etc and they hold to a point of you know especially the old primitive form of Baptist hold to the point you know well I'm predestinated I don't even have to worry about it God's going to save me one day somewhere and even as I've told you and you go back and check your history that some of them back there they didn't even believe in having Revival because they're afraid you might your kids might get saved when God didn't want them saved you say now that's that's kind of dumb well you go read the history and see if that's not what they said you know that was their thoughts and if you want that you just contact me about it be glad to show you where it come from and the doctrines well then you got that part then you go over from the calvinistic over into the Armenian form of uh Works Etc and people lean on the basis of I done something good this that or the other etc etc you know I paved the parking lot you know there's a lot of people preached into heaven that live like the devil all of their life and they just you know paint the church or pave the parking lot and the preacher preaches them into heaven because that's their their way of going you know right and that's their predestination but what have we found after all of studying and trying to cover all of the things that Paul summed it up by saying those who he for knows right amen forne Forno he did predestinate all right so we've been through it for quite a while studying it on the point of thinking that people want to go to predestination first which means a a destiny set that's the word predestination or or a set point the uh you know you didn't have anything to do with it there's no way you could kept from coming to church tonight cuz it's predestinated well see you did have something to do with it you got ready you cleaned up you know you you come to church you drove a lot of miles so there is a lot to do with it but see then looking at it correctly we we think about it as for knowledge is the greatest thing that could ever be thought of about uh Mankind and his doings that God fornew some people would want to be saved that's right but it's also at the same time he forew that some would not want to be saved now he will not override your free moral agency he gives you the choice it's not a stamped act of fact coming into life you know no well I happen to be born of a certain lineage and like coming into the message people they get into where if you're born from Adam you could be saved but if you come down from the lineage of the Beast you couldn't be saved well that's all garbage can and Paul said it endless genealogies and he said he didn't like that all right but thinking about it see for knowledge then will come before predestination amen he didn't predestinate and then for no no you know I mean you and I wouldn't do that we wouldn't go build a house and then decide what kind of house we want to build right you know what s thought some boards and build a house well how you going well we don't know how going to it's going to build it we wouldn't do something like that God doesn't either amen right remember we're not playing with somebody that doesn't know all things amen when you're talking about God remember he knows every thought that ever could anybody could ever have or else he's not omnicient if he's not omniscient then he wouldn't be Eternal and if he if he's just gaining ground of knowledge then which tree is he on we'll get to it in a little bit we're going to talk about those two trees all right but see forn knowledge comes first right so God fornew who would want to be saved and who wouldn't amen so then he could predestinate and say Jacob have I loved right but Esau how I hated that's right all right before they were ever born right right before they ever done anything wrong that's right whatever he could go ahead and say why because he could look all the way down to the end and see what would be am all right that's his for knowledge so he forew all things all right but then in knowing it and for knowing all things we know too that God had as we call them attributes amen he he wanted to be a savior am right you said well how do you know because I've experienced it haven't you so he wanted to do that amen now he wanted to be a Healer you say well how do you know cuz I've been healed all right he wanted to be all of those things but how could he display them and be perfect in what he was doing and then as Romans says the thing formed couldn't say why did you make me this way because God doesn't predestinate even by his own desires because the Bible said he desired it all be saved right now if you're going to put it on God remember you keeping it on the right way you're not holding it on some penan deal right but he knew who would want to be saved and who wasn't MH so he could predestinate right amen see we've been dealing now for quite a while for months in speaking of for knowledge the mind uh the thoughts of God and how they're Eternal and he cannot have another thought because if he did he wouldn't be God he can't say something in Genesis and change his mind by the time he gets to the Book of Revelations right right my saying is like this carnal but apply he couldn't start off in Genesis with a white dog wind up in Revelations with a spotted dog and said well I got a dog no he ch changed so that wouldn't be God he said I'm God and I change not therefore the sons of man could be dependent upon him I'm just paraphrasing that scripture right amen that we can depend upon it that he doesn't change that's right so all we got to do is just find his word that speaks to us right and then follow it from that all right and then we can walk right on into what we need to do so he doesn't predestinate by desires he predestines by forn knowledge right all right now but for knowledge remember is a knowledge of what will take place at a later time right amen right so now we're going to start tonight talking about for knowledge in an odd way a strange way because we're going to start talking about that God had these attributes in him and he wanted them displayed all right now how could he be a Healer when there was nothing sick right right how could he be a savior when there was nothing lost he created angel angels and they worshiped him right that gave him the name God as we call it MH because God means an object of worship so when the Angels worship him that would make him God Amen but that didn't make him savior healer Etc Advocate high priest he has many many titles to him all right so in doing that now we see that for him to display these things that some way they would wind up being somebody that would be lost and would need to be a savior that's right provided somebody would be sick you say well how do you know because we've experienced it right we've lived it that settles a whole point Point all right but now remember he can't make us lost that wouldn't be correct that's right we'll see in a minute about Sin see there's no way that sin that God can do anything in the line of sin right right no right and if he could change his mind you could accuse him of getting close to send him about your your life but now remember you can depend upon it if he if we realize he don't change right all right so then let's start on predestination remember what we said now lay aside all of your thoughts because you've been taught the Presbyterian talk predestination in other words the B Baptist Methodist I mean Baptist pre predestination and Presbyterian and like if if I'm going to step down here well I need to go ahead and get that done because I ain't going to never to reach nothing else till I do that cuz that's predetermined well now where's your for knowledge right you see we backed up in the mind of God and spent many services talking about his mind and his ways of being right mhm now we're going to start talking about predestination and we're going to see that first it's got to become by for knowledge so never forget that now no matter what we talk about remember for knowledge is first amen all right had they took that back there there wouldn't have been a split in the Baptist Church and split over PR destination to Brothers all right this has been a doctrine of mankind since for probably 4 500 years and even longer than that going back into the Catholics and the the uh doings on backward but now as I said then if there's going to be a if he's going to be a savior there's going to have to be somebody lost right mhm now we don't believe in the Mormon Doctrine right if you studied the Mormon Doctrine they believe we was all up in heaven everybody was up there and we decided to come to Earth to be lost and that Jesus would come down and die for us well I don't believe we would all up there right cuz I've been over it and over it and over it the only words you can use back in up in the even the the scholars for their words you know the the great learned ones is the word Elohim you can pronounce it him or him it means self-existing amen so if you're going to believe in God you got to remember there was a time that he existed alone right but then he begin to bring into being things that would uh later be of great value and see in doing that then he would provide the things that would now I hope you follow my thought God will provide the things that can be used to bring about the fall but he doesn't make them wrong right all right amen and we're going to talk about Lucifer son of the morning the Bible calls the anointed cherub yes that Stood Beside the Lord the Bible says he was created perfect that's right in his creation we have another word for him called the devil Lucifer Satan it's just a way of using it but he's called many things in the Bible he's called a serpent he's called the the Devil he's called uh Satan but he starts off as Lucifer the son of the morning all right now he would go from that of being created perfect and remember he was given the same thing you and I were given he was given free moral agency to make his own choice the devil was Lucifer so he wasn't created the devil he wasn't a bad guy to begin with in other words if you want to put it up in the correct order of understanding he was God's right-hand man he was there with the cherubims The Sims of the Angels but God knew that by allowing Satan Lucifer the devil to have a free moral agency a right to choose right free moral agency right that he would go wrong right now THS is for knowledge amen right right God's for knowledge Knew by allowing Satan to come the way he would allow him to come that he would turn out to be the devil right but he couldn't make him the devil he can't make a sinner and send a sinner to hell that's right amen he didn't make sin there's nothing in God for sin to originate from amen come on now I read a little scriptures too but let's don't get into carnality I know the Bible talks about Good and Evil I know the Bible talks about I create good and evil but remember if he created evil he's the same base as you and I are on right I don't mind saying that because you go back and check the original he permitted evil he never created evil I've tried to get you away from those words of creation beginnings and and things he permitted sin to appear amen all right he didn't make it all right now you following with me amen see we're talking about the predestin ation that I told you about 8 or 10 sermons ago I said we'll get back down to predestination and then we'll start seeing how valuable it has been to understand for knowledge all right so now by for knowledge he knew when he created the Angels he knew that Lucifer and he created him perfect now right but he knew he would go after his own desires all right we're going to read it in a minute in Revelations 12 but he knew that if he allowed him to do that that he'd get all exalted within himself and that he would lead at least a third of the Angels in into his Doctrine idea concept but my warning is I hope I have time enough to get to the end of the message is just remember Paul said that let Satan through his subtility be able to deceive or begal you and I as he did Eve see he warned us about that so that's the end of the message if I can get to there but don't I'll take it up Sunday all right so now remember he created angels I'm going to read these come down a second but I want a point in your mind he created angels they worshiped him that was nice and according to all of the understanding I've ever been able to read about about him uh he was placed over the northern kingdom and according to Scholars and readers that was the worship Kingdom or part of where worship was great and you just think about worship you mean that Satan would worship God may I quote the prophet he said you can worship God every day your life still be lost right you say no wait just a minute well just find it out check it out amen that's right you can worship all you want to but if you're not born again what good is it right right you go to churches and you see people and my Lord Saturday night they're in a honky tonk drunk or on drugs Sunday morning they go to church they put them on the platform and they singing oh how I love Jesus yeah worship read a story one time of a prostitute or the way she was must have been but she was a strip teas and she'd do a strip teas act in a club and then she'd go talk to the people about getting saved what from yeah see that's Satan through his subtility right has gotten to the minds of people amen all right but now follow with me my thought so then God would permit to come into being the things that would bring about the fall right he would place it in the garden he would do the things to where that all the things could be used and to bring a fall upon mankind but he couldn't make it now to be done he would permit it right all right permit it to come into being they would be two trees as we read during the scriptures there'd be two trees in the garden right one of them is a tree of life and we know that's Jesus Christ am correct all right and there's a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil right those were not apple trees pomegranates peaches or some amen that's why we don't believe that eve eat an apple that's right Apple only give you belly ache we're going to get down to what it is but one of them is a tree of life the other one is a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen you know Satan's not all bad you know we think about him the guy with the horns and H with a stick great mix and we think he's down at the hon he's not down at The Honky Tong tonight amen you know where he's at sitting on the fuse right here in church why does he want to go down there right remember he was over the worship he loves good music sure amen he's the author of it you ever heard Amazing Grace sung to the tune of the House of the Rising Sun sounds beautiful but you know what the House of the Rising son is don't you a prostitute house out in Texas I believe it was but yet you put them down and you sing it it sounds beautiful would you just take the words out you can sing the other song Right worship don't forget that but he predestinated now we're going to get into that now so by his for knowledge now listen are you following me right he looked down through and knew that if he created Lucifer they he go wrong right so then he could predestinate amen right now we getting the word predestinate he could set of Destiny he could set Lucifer's Destiny all the way to his destruction and put it in the word amen right he could predestinate he didn't make him the devil right so he could predestinate those angels that would take Satan's lie Lucifer's lie you know and he could predestinate their Destiny amen you know what the ones that fail now we're talking about the Fallen Angels you know that those Fallen Angels is what causes us to have a nature a lot of times the way we are that's what your Prophet said so we'll get back to that one of these days why do we act a certain way why are we certain doings you know like certain things something's motivating us right see those demons that fell for Lucifer are trying our best to drive us away from the word amen right but there were two-thirds of the angels that never fa and the Paul I believe the writing of it it's in the scriptures there that they are ministering SP spirits to minister to the hours of Salvation right that's the Bible right so he could predestinate him and he could have one ready for you when you got saved and he could help you and guide you take care of you you ever come very close to being killed wondering why you wouldn't killed amen amen and you come find out there was an angel there protecting you and other people may even see that angel and try to figure it all out you know predestination now comes into view the prophet said it ain't too bad of a word if you approach it correctly you keep it that he fornew so then he could predestinate Lucifer to be what he'd be right then we'll follow him he could come down as to be in one of those trees standing in the garden but remember he's not the bad guy with the horns that we look at you know right he's a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil right right it's a good tree sometime off of those trees we've come up with a lot of good things we don't have to sit and fan tonight we got an air conditioner y we could ride to church we didn't have to walk right you can get on an our plane and fly to California it's a matter of a few hours see your family fly back home all within one day or less get your schedules right you can just fly out there and see them fly right back good things but think about it now we're going to be talking about God's forn knowledge being transmitted down to earth amen and to see where we're at here in life okay now then in doing that let's just read a few things go ahead brother Joe and let's pull up number one we believe God sent a prophet we believe what he said so we can read what he said don't worry about it amen you believe in John Wesley you're going to read it you believe in Alexander Campbell you're going to read that we believe God sent a prophet amen so we don't strangers to it neither are you right all right preached a message called the Easter seal in 19654 you know paragraph 61 now there's a great statement and I want my Ministry Brothers to try to understand this see in the beginning God the great spirit he wasn't even God then and listen to him just listen to simple seven seventh grade education language and just listen to it in the beginning God the great spirit he wasn't even God right then he was the Eternal one God is an object of worship he had nothing to worship him there was no there was no Angels no nothing just God Alone him alone is eternal but in order to be God there had to be something to worship him so he created angels and beings and cherubims and so forth to worship him his great plan begin to unfold amen now his great plan you remember from Christ The Mystery of God revealed we were talking about that God had a plan and a purpose that's right that he was going to see achieved that's right he was going to have a people that wouldn't fall like he fell right she's going to take the word and stand on it amen all right she's predestinated yes to do that so I don't have no problem using the word then because all of it is dealing with for knowledge but watch his great plan unfold plan this plan is going to have to do with these two trees because we're going to drop from there down into the Earth in a second but remember now God had a plan yes his plan was not now listen carefully his plan was not for man to be lost so he could save him that's right no way no now if you believe in that kind of a god you sure got a messed up God and you also got a messed up mind so you need help on both lines I don't mind talking plain right I'm not deceiving nobody right right amen I'm just talking plain he never planned for man to be lost right but by his for knowledge he knew what would take place that's right his plan was to reveal himself to his family if he was to be a father if he was to be a savior A Healer that was his attributes and to be his father would mean that he would have a family right I Don't Call Him Father just cause it's some out of the way word some n name has been tacked on him he's my father amen amen because I'm talking about a spiritual Kingdom that's right amen not a natural all right we see his plan was to reveal himself to bring mankind into being give us a free Mor agency and reveal himself to us and for 6,000 years that's what he's been doing he done it for four and then come in flesh 2,000 years ago Amen to make yourself known but remember his great plan is to reveal himself but to do that he had to permit the other side to come into being amen are you following me okay now then watch what he says look at number two there well let's see yeah go ahead let's read number two then we'll go to the other one I gave him to brother Joe in a certain order go with number two and then we'll back up to 18 okay brother Jo he should take him to the baptism of the Holy Spirit preached in 1958 928 the morning service before there was a world Jesus Christ died to save it amen you believe that cuz the Bible said you know died for the foundation of the world now we know he didn't physically die in 2,000 years ago but in God's mind amen that's where we've been all this time in God's mind right right and what why did God the infinite God ever permit sin why did he permit sin you know there's attributes in Gods and if God would have never permitted Satan watch you he knew when he created Lucifer that he was to be the one to corrupt the world now if he didn't know that he not God so just forget it go home eat drink be married you're glorified among anyway off a Darwin street now we don't believe in junk do we that's right that's why I make statements like that be happy live and die forget it if you don't believe in God correctly he knew Lucifer if he created him God's got God's not something like pushed off in one corner but he's infinite God who never had a beginning or never will have an end and in him him is in his ATT and in him he is in his attributes is a savior how could he ever be known as Savior if it hadn't been something to save how would have ever been known so now what happened go back to one a brother Jo Revelations 12 and let's read what happened all right now don't get massively confused in Revelations 12 is compound meanings okay so if you don't understand that call me I'll tell you Revelations 12 7-9 says and there was war in heaven now war never begun on Earth we go to it in the minute sin never beun on earth now boy I tell you what I ain't never heard nothing like that seeing up in heaven well you tell me where it come from all right there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angel now the dragon is Satan the serpent the Lucifer the devil okay Michael is Christ all right now that's over in Daniel where it says Michael you're archangel but Satan was fighting but he prevailed not neither there was Place found anymore neither was there t h e i r those angels and that devil was cast out of Heaven amen all there's place no more found and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his Ang Angels were cast out with him all right so what happens he comes to Earth to the Garden yep he's cast out amen so look at the next one the prophet would tell you from that day on Calvary number three 69:25 paragraph 45 sin did not start on the earth sin started in heaven right right see Lucifer was the original unbeliever cuz what is sin right sin's not smoking gambling running around with women that's attributes you do that because you're an unbeliever sin is unbelief he that believeth not Jesus said is condemned already am amen right so what is sin unbelief so sin did not start on the earth sin started in heaven Lucifer the devil was condemned was The Condemned creature for his Disobedience before he ever struck the Earth sin began in heaven where God put the angels and so forth upon the same basis that he put human beings on now what what basis he put him on knowledge of the tree of knowledge the tree of life and the tree of knowledge where man could take his choice and Lucifer was given the premiss premises every to make his choice he wanted something better than God had that started to trouble and what happened he fell to earth when he fell to Earth in the garden amen all right now we come to where we read while ago that man was created put upon the Earth you know we'll get back to all the other part about Eve being taken from Adam Etc but they were there and they were told that they could have eat every tree in the garden except for one tree that was a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now you know yourself has been taught to you all your life that Eve ate an apple and it caused to fall now I think it's about time to get out of our dumbness let alone our stupidity if eating apples make you find out you're naked we need to get a a couple of billion bushels and start pour them out right well no they don't believe that they BL you ate a pomegranate right don't want to get too far into that because I'm W to hold one thing I'm wanting to hold to the point that showing you and you and I looking at God by his forn knowledge knew if he allowed Satan to come into being that he would go the wrong way and he would come straight to the Earth and he would attack the people on Earth and we keep on attacking them until the end to where it's full completely Clos it out all right but now there was two trees in the garden you can eat of all the trees just leave that tree of knowledge a good and evil along what about having a big old Vineyard a great big thing with apples pomegranate peaches PES plumps all kind of fruit I mean just everything and there's one tree and you told just don't foot with that tree that's right you think we wouldn't be dumb enough to do it but if we could get a little bit of knowledge how good that Apple was on that tree we might want to bite out of it but they wouldn't trees show me a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that's right that's all I want to see any tree you name Oak Plum Peach P figs peon anything some good right but where's there a tree that's called a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen where's that tree that you can eat off of and Get Smart no you get fat you get the belly EG you get all kind of things but you don't get smart amen right right right so now us deal with who them two trees are right and think about them cuz they're going to be in relationship to mankind right or they would not have been in the garden that's right m you think of Adam and how great he was we covered our Sunday he had control of the animals he was the god of the earth amen he was right amen he wasn't the god of Heaven no we don't believe in that the god of the heaven is God himself but he was God of the earth you know that we're still in control of the earth amen you fly over to Africa you jump out as long as ain't something wrong with him you jump out and you run out there and there a big old line he just takes off running bck old elephant he goes running why because he knows there's something about that one that's in front of him that's different than they are man was made a marvelous thing as we talked about Sunday God put to Genesis 1:26 man end of that 27 man that's right breath in his nostrils and he become a living Soul amen he was controller of the earth that's right but yet this one that had his Creation in Beauty and wonderful he's also the deceiver amen and he comes down to earth and when he comes to Earth he's dwelling there and see we look at it like trees well okay I've asked for a tree of knowledge I want to see a tree of knowledge I'd also like to see a tree of life right is there any tree we can eat of to get young they do we need it is any tree that we can need of to live forever right right not quite so it's not dealing with that so let's read a little bit just a few things then we'll start preaching well go ahead to number four brother Joe Ephesian Church age 1960 1205 paragraph 250 Jesus he was talking about Jesus being the the bread of life you remember that in the scripture right he said if you'll eat of this bread you'll live forever amen now what was Jesus talking about was it a certain baked bread that he made a Kentucky Fried Chicken you know or was it even to eat his own body right that couldn't have give no life to nobody but he said he was the bread that come down in the wilderness right right am I quoting scripture what came down in the wilderness Mana but it tyed Christ right so aren't you following him if a man eats this bread he shall never die will this man give his will this man give his body to eat they said now he's mad sure enough the bread of life was from the Tree of Life listen which they were eating from the Garden of Eden he was the tree of life now where to know that anybody Bible readers know that Jesus Christ is the Tree of Life the bread amen all right now now the tree of life was a person amen right right that's right the person of Jesus Christ the only author of Life the only ability to receive life not a bread we eat we just took communion Sunday not a wine you drink that's his blood and a body that bread that you eat that's his body those are symb olcs nothing real symbolics he was the symbol of the bread that came down in the wilderness he was The Giver of Life right but now watch he was the tree of life if the tree of life was a person then the tree of knowledge was a person that's right right right who are those those two persons go ahead to number five which is Page 102 Ephesian Church age book Church Ephesian Church age in the church age book now we have come this far let me try to crystalize your thinking on this subject so you can see the necessity of going into the serpent Seed doctrine as I have we start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden the tree of life was Jesus the other tree is definitely Satan because of what came forth from the fruit of that tree amen now that should be sensual amen does that need any great light bub to turn on sensible seventh grade education language right right but a prophet of God what now then we know that both of these trees had a relationship to man or they would never have been placed there they must have had a part in The Sovereign plan and purpose of God in their relationship to the Mankind and to himself or we could never impute omnicient unto God this is all true so far is it not now the word must definitely set forth that from before the foundation of the world the purpose of God he goes on according to election and goes on down but these two trees amen sir have a definitely Rel relationship to man it's easily to establish and no one would argue the point that Jesus Christ was the Tree of Life in symbolic speaking right why because there is no life without him am he was the bread that come down from heaven Heaven is all things well then what would be the tree of knowledge why would it be so a commandment if it's just some form of head knowledge or thoughts you know of good points why would it be so bad to prot take of the tree of knowledge knowledge is wonderful as long as it's not contrary to God's word I said we rode in a car coming to church we didn't have to walk that's knowledge is good but when it takes the place of God right all right so then in the garden was two persons standing there one of them was Jesus Christ the other one was Lucifer am the devil Satan all right go on brother Joe with the next one so it will prove the point of what we're talking about page 97 of the Ephesian Church age but what is the Tree of Life well first of all we know first of all we would have to know what the tree itself stands for what in numbers 24 and 6 as balam described Israel he said they were tree aign AO which the Lord ha planted he's calling the People Trees you remember the man that was prayed for there in the Bible and he opened it and he he began he said that he seen people walking but he said it's like trees moving but yet here see trees throughout the Bible or the scripture refer to persons that's Psalms 1 you know Psalms 1 what is it he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water right so trees are referring thus the Tree of Life must be the person of life and that is Jesus that'd be easy to accept but what about the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen it would have to be the Devil Himself two trees look at the next one 9 98 Ephesian Church 8 all right if the tree of life is a person then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is a person also it can't be otherwise thus the righteous one and the wicked one stood side by side there in the midst of the Garden of Eden read it Ezekiel 28:13 read it thou Satan H has been in Eden the Garden of God all right Satan was in the garden y two trees all right with Mankind in the garden look at the next one expectations 1958 503 508 E20 and in this lifetime if we have a CH chance to choose right and wrong it's back to the same like it like it was in Eden a man and a woman given a choice to do right or do wrong they have two trees before them we are taught in the scripture one of them was the Tree of Life the other was a tree of knowledge man chose to eat off the tree of knowledge and the first time he at ate from that that tree he severed his friendship with God you remember what happened when they ate of the tree of knowledge right God come down in the cool of the day and Adam and Eve was hiding making them some fig leaves clothing you know now if it was Apples why did they want clothes to put on right amen amen right right if you can't see what happened in the garden that's right from that then you're blind just put it that way that's right that ain't throwing off nobody it's just blind thinking the other one was a true of knowledge man chose to eat off the tree of knowledge the first time he ate from that tree he SED his friendship with God and he was made a mortal being he brought down since then man has desired to live from that tree of knowledge and he's done great things but knowledge only can reach so far knowledge is all right but when you've reached the the end of your knowledge then believe on their own tree of knowledge you know the tree of knowledge was able to produce uh the ability to make a languages and write Bibles right sure right the tree of knowledge we wouldn't we wouldn't have this like this if they hadn't to come up with the printing presses and etc etc and finally got it where they can print it for us tree of knowledge is fine all right but think about it let's jump over and then we'll come back to these later Eve begin to stop and reason now there was no snake in the garden the Bible says it the serpent was the most subtle of all Beast a serpent is a snake a beast is an upright creature right right amen right the serpent is a symbolic of Satan right the serpent from the garden all right Eve be to reason with that old snake that's something ain't it snake laying up in an apple tree with a Big Apple in his mouth come on that's right and he starts talking to Eve and he says you can eat of every tree in the garden she said every one of them but one now am I reading the scripture you want to read it she become a good woman preacher that's why the Bible forbids her to preach that's right amen cuz she was also the first one deceived y right now you can like it or lump it but a woman's easier to deceive than a man anytime why because that's the side of her brain that works on emotional emotional side you just picture in the garden that old snake running around there trying to talk to Adam right if you going to make it a snake and had him talking to Adam Adam ain't going to listen to him but Eve began to listen right and she took her free moral agency to listen she was told to leave that tree alone right but it's like I said you tell them kids now go home and try it you tell them kids you can touch anything in this house but leave that lamp alone you might as well go buy you another one right where's the kid going the best thing to do is to tell them you can handle that lamp all you want to and then won't fool with it you know but when you make it tantalizing everybody wants to know what it is we're not going to get into the seat of the serpent tonight we're just talking on one thing Satan through the ability that he had was able to talk to Eve right that wasn't no snake crawling around right the Bible says the serpent was the most subtle of all Beast right he was an upright creature walking around in the garden that looked just exactly like man right now to show you one more Point that's why Darwin can never find a missing link between man and the monkey but if he read the Bible right right that's right right amen he could come all the way up to the monkey but he couldn't cross from the monkey to the man right if he'd read the Bible he would have found a beast standing there amen read your Bible he was made a snake re on thy belly shalt thou go and dust shall be thy meat he wouldn't no snake to start with that's right amen he was an upright creature a manen walking around in the garden and the devil began to talk to him the only problem with that Beast was that Beast never had a soul right he'd have been brought up into the human race if he had have been he was didn't have a soul it was just like all the rest of the animals but he can be used amen you said animals can talk come on get home turn the TV on you'll find dogs talking horses Counting right and if you think animals can't be used uh I thought bam was riding on a donkey one day that the old donkey started talking to him am I in the Bible he said I've been you I encourage you all over the place while you be me he said if you look right over there there's an angel standing there with a sword fixing to kill you yeah P wait a minute but see Satan got into he entered into that Beast Amen in the form to talk amen now let's get plain and get a short part of my message and quit what's the most deceiving Place position Etc that Satan could be using today the preachers in the pull pit now you tell me that ain't right that's right amen I'll be glad to open the office to you for the rest of the night you tell me that the worst thing is not a preacher the Bible said that even Satan's Angels or ministering spirits right let's read the last one and quit see Satan said you can eat of every tree he said no wait wait just a minute now let me straighten you out on that good woman preacher right yeah now you ain't going to get me to go tell no woman preacher she ain't called to preach cuz that's her business she just ain't going to preach here that's right as long as I'm here she ain't going to preach here but the worst part of it is a bunch of perverted men preachers with women's preacher spirits on right that's it so you'll know what I don't like right amen and see the Beast begin to talk to Eve and she begin to straighten him out ain't that what women like to do come on straighten you out he said what about men do too so don't worry about it but you get a hard-headed woman you ain't going to convince her now you can do what you want to you can knock a man in the head and he'll change his mind at least he won't talk in front of you you ain't allowed to hit the woman so you can't do nothing that way you get a hard-headed woman you ain't going to convince her about nothing amen the Bible says that Eve still thinks she's right that's right amen right come on so what is it let's get one more scripture and then we'll quit okay go ahead with 2 Corinthians 11 Jo Paul said for I'm jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband one God we don't believe in a trinity amen the word Trinity is not in the Bible we laugh in the other day somebody was watching somebody to one of the visitors and I said there ain't no word Trinity in the Bible and somebody happened to be looking over and they was going they went back into the the uh concordance thing in the back in the Bible then he just folded it up you couldn't find Trinity there ain't no Trinity in the Bible we don't believe in a trinity we believe in one true and living God and Jesus is that God that's not Oneness because we believe Father Son and Holy Ghost makes the one true and living God there was a time he was manifesting himself as the father and even the Holy Spirit now in I mean the son now in the Holy Spirit the same God Amen not three Gods believe in one true and living God that's why we're gonna get to it that's what Paul's saying I have espoused you I've wed you I've taught you I've brought you to the understanding of one husband that's Christ amen right he's the head of all things is that what Paul said that's right that's why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not father son Holy Ghost show it to me in the Bible show me in the Bible anybody's ever baptized father son Holy Ghost and I'll give you $10,000 amen that ain't exalted or smart ellic that's just showing you how sure right amen the word of God is well Matthew 28:19 yeah read it let go baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit that's and when I baptize you that's way I do it I said to fulfill that Great Commission to baptize you according to the Lord Jesus Christ he said to baptize you in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit I now baptize thee my brother in the or sister what in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right that's right right if you ain't been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ your baptism come in the Catholic church that's right so go ahead stay with Mama that's right that's right you see I don't have to be be re baptized I was sincere when I got baptized so were there in the Bible when they were baptized under John but when they come into the new they had to be baptized again so come on look what he said but I fear right L by any means as the serpent begot Eve through his subtility you know what he told her he said God and Adam's keeping it from you I said you were made to reproduce and she went right after it y now you tell me they wasn't two kids born from one you got one act from Adam and two kids born one of them was Cain the other one was Abel Abel followed Adam's lineage Cain where did he get that nastiness to kill his brother amen that's right from his daddy come on so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity look that is in Christ and folks we're in the worst day in the age ever that that could be fulfilled we're in the age when men in this message are taking this message and preaching two Lords preaching Jesus wouldn't god Till The River Jordan Etc the Simplicity of Christ and they're not holding it right and they're making many gods out of it that's right sounds like Satan has got to Eve again the Eve in the last day the church was that what Paul was afraid of the Simplicity that's in Christ what about a man could stand up what about brother brandom standing there in his day and speaking to theologians that could wrap him up with newspaper work where all of their their big you know they've been to school and he says listen said the Bible says now you you remember this the script says the Eternal godhead can be understood by the things we see right now is that scripture brother cor be understood by the things we see what is it one God I am a father I am a son I am a human being I have many manifestations to me that is the Simplicity of Christ Jesus amen but you see there's where men go the wrong way go ahead brother Joel pull that back up because I ain't finished I want to ask you what you think about this scripture pull pull it back up brother Joe 2 Corinthians 11 what do you think about that scripture for he that cometh preaching another Jesus whom we have not preached know words another God another way another Doctrine besides what he was preaching what did he say in Galatians is it galatians: 18 where he says that no it's not Galatians but it where he said let him be condemned if he got any other Doctrine than what I've brought all right Galatians 18 okay for he that cometh preaching another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received now what does he mean you receive another Spirit which you have not received my brain's going something's being said figure it out you receive another Spirit which you have not received okay simple language you receive another spirit that we didn't preach right amen where's that Spirit going to take you or another gospel which you have not accepted now what does it say this end you but well bear with him I don't that sounds odd so Paul what are you saying are you telling me that or another if I receive another gospel you might well bear with him you know just go with him no cuz Paul wouldn't tell you to go with him right right what is it saying you see there's where I come up against the wall and I stand there and I said Lord now you said something what' you say right you said if a man comes preaching another Jesus and we have not received or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted is he saying Just Go With It Go with it now that's not Paul uh so I searched and I searched Knox was the best understanding that I could get the Bible the Knox understanding he said Paul is saying if somebody comes along here with all these other doctrines all these other spirits and all these other gospel he said what you need to do he said you need to bear with me you need to be patient with me he's not telling you to go with it he's telling that you need to be patient with him who's trying to explain it come on Paul is saying bear with me until I can explain it to you don't go with it but if you don't understand be with me Church I know the way that I preach and the way that I do and the things that I tell you and I teach you but I've never told you to go somewhere else and do I've told you to bear with me bear with me until I can find words to explain it cuz I'm not talking about another gospel I'm not talking about another Spirit I'm not talking about another God Amen I'm talking about the one true and living God in Jesus is his name bear with me until I can get it into better words but instead of that I'm called the intellects everything in the book but that's all right cuz that's got to go with it that's right it don't hurt me it hurts inside of me because the spirit inside of me is trying his best to get the truth to you and I right bear with me because I'm trying to bring Christ to you I'm trying to bring it in the garden and let you see what this devil is doing the devil is now into the mind of mankind in the greatest way it could ever be cuz he's taking this message that's right this message is what he's using Y ab and destroying the gospel truth come on brothers let's stand two trees one is the Tree of Life the other one is a tree of knowledge knowledge the Bible says puffeth up but you go look up knowledge now go home run in your computer the word knowledge in the Bible you know what I mean go in the Bible pull up knowledge and you'll find only about two times of knowledge that it's speaking that it's bad I really don't know about one it says knowledge puffers up the rest of them are wonderful things the knowledge of God is wonderful right knowledge and wisdom goes hand in hand knowledge the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil but this is the way brother R said he'll give Satan will give you just enough knowledge to kill you why because you think you got it figured out and you can't figure it out that's right there's scriptures in the Bible right today that I would not speak on none whatsoever because I do not understand it I will wait until he speaks but when I speak then I don't fear no problems I know where he stands go ahead brother 403 in the spiral book anybody have a need predestination is not a bad word amen I've been to the water and I've been baptized I've been in the blood of the Lamb I've been changed from the creature that I once was and is now my name
