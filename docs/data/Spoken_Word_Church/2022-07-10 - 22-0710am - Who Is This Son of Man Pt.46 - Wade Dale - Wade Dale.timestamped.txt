[11:04] we believe

[11:09] amen we're going to meet the lord today
[11:11] boy we had a good time in bible study
[11:13] last night
[11:14] somebody say amen
[11:15] [Applause]
[11:17] and saying nothing against the old
[11:19] people that weren't there but you should
[11:20] have been
[11:22] cause we had a good time
[11:24] a good time a real good time and those
[11:26] ones that was on the zoom meeting sister
[11:28] freda and different ones that zoom
[11:29] meeting is open for anybody if you look
[11:31] on whatsapp you can get uh get the
[11:34] address to uh to get on it and you can
[11:36] ask questions and and you can just be
[11:38] part of the group if you're not able to
[11:40] i know it's tough
[11:42] but you know what
[11:44] a little bit later on we're going to
[11:45] preach on faith is works
[11:48] huh
[11:49] no works is faith expressed
[11:52] your works shows that you've got faith
[11:54] amen and brother branham i just read a
[11:57] quote where brother brown said
[11:58] it ain't shouting
[12:02] faith is not that
[12:04] faith is a settled in your heart
[12:08] that god's going to do what he said he'd
[12:09] do
[12:11] you know why
[12:12] god said so
[12:14] from now we're going to say god said so
[12:17] not man
[12:18] not an angel
[12:19] god said so
[12:21] and god gave us this word to believe
[12:24] let me read you a little quote here
[12:26] on there's only one provided way of god
[12:28] for anything
[12:29] brother brown says i don't believe in
[12:31] intellectual speeches
[12:33] i believe in the word itself
[12:35] and then stay with that promise until
[12:37] it's made manifest and fulfilled that's
[12:40] our problem
[12:41] that's our problem we say okay we
[12:43] believe god's word this is a good thing
[12:44] to be this is a good meeting that we're
[12:46] in this is a good feeling that we're
[12:48] having and then you go home and the
[12:50] devil goes
[12:57] god will never do that
[13:00] if y'all were here last night i
[13:01] appreciate
[13:03] everybody that was here
[13:05] but i want you to understand something
[13:06] as we were saying last night and i
[13:08] believe it'll turn a switch on if you'll
[13:09] think about it
[13:11] that
[13:11] listen
[13:13] god can't change his mind
[13:15] right
[13:16] think with me god can never have a new
[13:19] thought he can never think of something
[13:22] and then think of something different
[13:24] everybody with me
[13:26] so if he loves you now
[13:30] he always
[13:32] has loved you
[13:35] there's not an up and down in the day
[13:36] you think oh god's left me no you left
[13:38] god
[13:41] not don't put the fault on god
[13:43] because he don't change
[13:45] but we have to if we meet his
[13:46] requirement then we what we changed to
[13:48] him not him changed us
[13:50] and there's not days sure we have bad
[13:52] days sure we have good days but you know
[13:53] what
[13:54] god still loves us
[13:56] if he loved this before the foundation
[13:57] of the world there's no way he can
[13:59] change that
[14:00] amen because he saw that you would love
[14:03] him down here
[14:04] therefore by foreknowledge he loved you
[14:06] up there amen really simple
[14:08] predestination and so see you think well
[14:10] that's just god pulling you through a
[14:11] tube no it's god seeing what you wanted
[14:14] seeing your desires by your free will by
[14:16] your free moral agency he saw what you
[14:18] wanted
[14:19] and if you didn't want it
[14:21] he didn't have to have it back there to
[14:22] give it to you
[14:23] if you never wanted it
[14:26] adolf hitler they never wanted it so god
[14:28] never had him in the eternal part of his
[14:30] mind back before the foundation of the
[14:31] world sure he thought of adolf hitler
[14:33] but he out hitler was not in his eternal
[14:35] thoughts
[14:36] you and i are not just part of the
[14:37] eternal thoughts we are his eternal
[14:39] thoughts
[14:40] made manifest and unfolded down here we
[14:43] had to come down here god loved us but
[14:44] we had to come down here
[14:47] to do what show that we love him
[14:50] amen come here as my savior my healer my
[14:53] redeemer all the redemptive names of
[14:56] jehovah that's why we love him more
[14:58] than just being zombies that come to the
[15:00] earth and saying oh this is our god no
[15:02] we come down here to go through trials
[15:04] tibulate tribulations and all these
[15:06] different things sicknesses
[15:08] that we go through i was thinking
[15:09] yesterday i'm gonna keep you standing
[15:11] for a minute
[15:12] stretch your legs
[15:14] but i was thinking yesterday you know
[15:15] brother ron spencer everybody knows him
[15:17] he has stage four cancer
[15:19] it's in several parts of his body he's
[15:21] taking chemotherapy
[15:23] he stood in a prayer line the other
[15:24] night and prayed for people for an hour
[15:26] with stage four cancer now
[15:29] what is a greater testimony because see
[15:32] he went back to the doctor and the
[15:33] doctor says you still got it
[15:36] but we don't know why you're reacting
[15:38] like you are
[15:40] freda
[15:42] been taking chemo and all different
[15:43] things she don't even look any different
[15:44] than she did before
[15:46] right
[15:47] but there's brother ron and i said what
[15:49] a greater testimony what's a greater
[15:50] testimony than for for ron to come in
[15:53] and say well they found nothing i'm
[15:54] cancer-free you say oh praise god that's
[15:56] a miracle but what about him standing
[15:58] and preaching every sunday going through
[16:00] a prayer line and
[16:02] and he goes to the doctor and they said
[16:04] you still got it but we don't understand
[16:07] that's a greater mystery and a miracle
[16:09] to me that if you can have it
[16:12] this disease
[16:14] and still function
[16:16] as the bride of jesus christ so let's
[16:17] just take that as our faith and let it
[16:19] build our faith
[16:21] that all things are possible with god
[16:23] stage four cancer boy it sounds bad
[16:26] well watch him online every once in a
[16:28] while
[16:29] you think he's got stage four holy ghost
[16:30] is what you think he's got and ain't no
[16:32] stage four cancer not in that guy

[22:26] should be with them father just take
[22:28] care of us in the furthem of this
[22:29] service we ask in the name of jesus
[22:31] amen
[22:32] all right john 1 1 in the beginning was
[22:34] the word the word was with god and the
[22:35] word was god
[22:37] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[22:40] among us and we beheld his glory the
[22:42] glory of the only begotten of the father
[22:44] full of grace and truth now how many of
[22:45] you know that we know for one thing's
[22:48] for sure that scripture was fulfilled
[22:50] when jesus came on earth and now we know
[22:53] where that jesus is he's in me and you
[22:56] so now our flesh
[23:01] our flesh listen his flesh is no
[23:03] different than ours as far as flesh goes
[23:05] he had to have a german and egg come
[23:07] together god created it we know that
[23:09] and he but but that flesh was not
[23:11] eternal
[23:13] that flesh was not perfect
[23:15] that flesh was getting old
[23:18] it was dying
[23:20] but by one scripture
[23:23] it couldn't corrupt
[23:25] it was corruptible but he couldn't
[23:27] corrupt because of one scripture i'll
[23:29] not leave his soul in hell
[23:30] or suffer thy holy one to see
[23:32] corruption so when are we gonna jump
[23:35] into that
[23:36] we jump into that we'll see that since
[23:38] he's already died
[23:40] we don't have to
[23:42] we don't have to die
[23:44] we don't have to
[23:45] by faith we're going to see that romans
[23:47] 12 verse 2 says and be not conformed to
[23:50] this world
[23:51] but be transformed by what by the
[23:53] renewing of your mind
[23:55] our thoughts
[23:57] and that statue of perfect man
[23:59] is not so much it's inside the soul but
[24:02] it's letting me out into the other
[24:04] outlets of memories and conscious
[24:06] affection imagination which that's where
[24:08] you're what
[24:09] that's where your mind is
[24:11] amen so
[24:13] by the renewing of your mind that you
[24:15] may prove now look that you may prove
[24:17] not god you god's going to prove through
[24:20] you
[24:21] what is that good and acceptable and
[24:22] perfect will of god we know that's his
[24:24] word for i say through the grace given
[24:26] unto me to every man that is among you
[24:28] not to think of himself more highly than
[24:30] he ought to think
[24:31] balance
[24:33] but to think soberly according as god
[24:35] hath dealt with every man the measure we
[24:38] were talking about last time of faith
[24:40] for as we have many members in one body
[24:42] and all members have not the same office
[24:44] we don't have 12 pastors
[24:47] we don't have 24 preachers
[24:49] right
[24:50] you've got certain ones that stand in
[24:52] that position and that position is what
[24:54] we need we honor the position
[24:56] and we have laity we have deacons and
[24:58] different ones but that makes a body as
[25:00] brown said not an organization but an
[25:02] organism
[25:03] all right everybody with me on that an
[25:04] organism not an organization all right
[25:07] having them gifts different according to
[25:09] the grace that is given to us
[25:11] as brother louise said we can some of
[25:12] you would some of you come up under
[25:14] pentecost and you can shout and speak in
[25:16] tongues and because that's what you came
[25:17] up under
[25:18] somebody come up under baptist some of
[25:20] it become other presbyterians some of
[25:21] them just come up from the world
[25:23] all right and so you have different
[25:25] gifts but you know what that's what i
[25:27] want you to see that you move into that
[25:28] you've got to move into that
[25:31] you got to move into that part that you
[25:33] are and stay there
[25:35] stay in that gift that god gave you
[25:36] because you know what he's not going to
[25:38] give you somebody else's gift
[25:41] he's going to give you your gift if you
[25:43] believe that
[25:45] whether it be prophecy let us prophesy
[25:47] according to the what proportion or
[25:49] portion
[25:50] of faith that is given to each one of us
[25:52] you may be seeing the lord as blessing
[25:54] to the reading of the word
[25:57] so now we've been talking about the
[25:59] first stage we're going to fly through
[26:00] this real quick because i want to get to
[26:02] something
[26:03] the first stage is the birth listen you
[26:04] got to be born again and we were talking
[26:07] last night you know it's it's good that
[26:12] let me say it this way
[26:14] if if you're if you're a beginner in god
[26:18] and if you're trying to get your life
[26:20] right and you're trying to get the new
[26:23] birth or you're trying to to do things
[26:25] right
[26:26] you may be your backslid maybe you've
[26:28] maybe you've went away from god maybe
[26:30] you don't have the new birth but you try
[26:32] don't worry about the seal
[26:36] don't worry about daniel 70 weeks
[26:38] don't worry about what you're gonna eat
[26:40] in the millennium
[26:41] don't worry about how we gonna do it how
[26:43] now listen we talked about that last
[26:45] night but i thought
[26:47] you can talk to a baby
[26:49] but then you also gotta talk to the
[26:51] mature ones
[26:52] there's your balance
[26:54] we can have so much teaching until we
[26:56] leave the little ones away behind and we
[26:58] can have so much milk until the ones
[27:01] that won't meet gets hungry
[27:03] amen so you got to have that balance so
[27:05] every once in a while you gotta go one
[27:07] way with the young kids and stay here
[27:09] but let me instruct you though if you're
[27:11] a young person in christ
[27:13] just get to know christ
[27:18] read your bible study the word of god
[27:22] and then what your works is going to
[27:24] show how much faith you got
[27:27] come to church
[27:28] read your bible
[27:30] be a part of the church you don't have
[27:31] to be a part of the church
[27:33] well i got to do everything i you got to
[27:35] be aware of those people sometimes
[27:37] that wants to do everything right
[27:39] we had a guy at mcdonald's one time when
[27:42] they have that we just had the new
[27:43] double drive through remember you know
[27:45] how they are you pay on one side and
[27:47] then go get your food on them just got
[27:48] it this was back in the
[27:50] oh i don't know maybe in the motherboard
[27:52] 80s
[27:54] so
[27:56] so this guy i mean how many of you kids
[27:59] love to work on friday night
[28:02] not many
[28:04] how many of y'all love to work on
[28:05] saturday night when all your friends
[28:07] without pottering and having a good time
[28:09] no you didn't want to wear it this one
[28:11] kid he wanted to work every friday night
[28:13] and every saturday night
[28:14] and we thought you know what first thing
[28:16] we thought man
[28:17] this guy we need more like him
[28:20] the joker was stealing us blind
[28:24] friday night and saturday night are you
[28:26] two busiest nights of the week
[28:28] he was in that back double drive-through
[28:30] and he was taking and taking if you give
[28:32] him four dollars he's getting 350 and
[28:35] putting it in the tail and taking 50
[28:36] cents to put it in his pocket
[28:42] so beware of those people that want to
[28:44] do everything
[28:45] right
[28:46] i'm i'm here i'll just do whatever well
[28:48] be careful that's why i said luis good
[28:51] sermon today balance
[28:53] amen balance i don't want to do
[28:55] everything
[28:57] and y'all may hate me i don't care i
[28:59] really i really don't care if you hate
[29:00] me about this but i've got sister
[29:02] regina's going to do part of this this
[29:04] uh
[29:05] um
[29:06] leaving and and getting on time and
[29:08] doing all this stuff because you know
[29:09] what we need it and i don't want to do
[29:11] it
[29:13] i got other things to do all right so we
[29:15] what we delegate amen but you delegate
[29:18] it to somebody that you feel
[29:21] can do a good job all right but that guy
[29:23] was stealing us blind there's no telling
[29:24] how much that little kid finally about a
[29:26] month a month later somebody said
[29:29] that guy's working too many friday night
[29:31] to be 16 years old and
[29:34] so we started watching him from the
[29:36] outside somebody would stand outside in
[29:38] a car sit in a car and watch in that
[29:40] drive through and watch him take in a
[29:42] five dollar bill and then give an amount
[29:45] of change and then we pulled his drawer
[29:46] real quick and counted it and yeah we
[29:48] found him real quick
[29:49] let him go we didn't we didn't send him
[29:51] to the pokey but
[29:53] those of you that don't know what that
[29:54] was that's the jail
[29:56] we just slapped him on the hands and
[29:58] said look man
[29:59] get out of here
[30:01] but he was jealous he was zealous about
[30:03] what he was doing well he was zealous
[30:05] because he wanted to steal his blind
[30:07] so romans 8 verse 5 why in the world i
[30:09] said that for as many as are left by the
[30:10] spirit of god they are the son just
[30:12] beware
[30:14] they are the sons of god for you have
[30:16] not received the spirit of bondage again
[30:17] to fear now look fear and faith doesn't
[30:19] work together
[30:24] faith has no place for fear
[30:28] ever
[30:29] right so you've not received the spirit
[30:31] of bondage again to fear but you have
[30:33] received what the spirit of adoption
[30:34] whereby we cry have a father the spirit
[30:37] itself bearing witness with our spirit
[30:39] now we were talking about that the other
[30:40] day that we are the children of god now
[30:43] look
[30:44] that's good to just stop right there
[30:46] but you got to continue on because you
[30:49] get something if you're a child
[30:51] you're an heir you're an heir of god and
[30:53] join heirs with christ if so be that we
[30:55] what
[30:57] suffer
[30:59] suffer
[31:00] with him
[31:02] that we may be also glorified
[31:04] together as i was saying a few weeks ago
[31:06] listen your life according to your
[31:08] eternal life is not even counted
[31:11] your natural life down here is only
[31:13] about 70 to 80 years and that's it
[31:16] but what about an eternity
[31:18] so are you getting ready for this life
[31:22] are you getting ready for the other one
[31:23] that we got
[31:24] are you getting ready for the life
[31:26] that's why when we receive the life of
[31:27] christ that's why the new birth is so
[31:29] important when you receive the life of
[31:31] christ yes you got to do all these
[31:32] external things but there's one motive
[31:34] that brother louise was talking about
[31:36] there's one motive of that guy he don't
[31:37] want to be out that wire all the time
[31:40] he wants to get to that other side
[31:42] because you know what it doesn't matter
[31:43] how much faith he's got he's on a tube
[31:46] about that big around
[31:47] he wants to get out there where he's on
[31:49] flat ground where he can stand on his
[31:50] two feet that's the same way with me and
[31:52] you i won't go to heaven
[31:55] and i know heaven's here we know that
[31:57] but i want to be able to go into that
[31:59] other dimension
[32:01] with god where he is whether he takes me
[32:03] by death now that's okay it's just a
[32:05] vehicle
[32:06] to take me to where i'm going
[32:08] you know pull the pill apart take the
[32:10] shell off go into the other dimension
[32:11] come back pick the shell back up and
[32:13] live for an eternity and where we're
[32:15] going to live right here
[32:17] you know where judgment you know what
[32:18] the judgment seat is going to be right
[32:20] here the white throne judgment is going
[32:22] to be right here because this is where
[32:24] they stand
[32:28] is where you did all your
[32:30] stuff you're going to be judged for
[32:31] right
[32:32] you weren't judged in heaven you're
[32:34] going to be judged down here and thank
[32:35] god you and i are not going to be on the
[32:37] receiving end of that judgment
[32:40] you know what you're having your
[32:41] judgment right now
[32:44] come to church read your bible do the
[32:45] things of god
[32:47] you're being judged right now
[32:50] what god said
[32:52] so we looked at justification baby form
[32:54] we know that's chopping off our past
[32:55] sins we should but see we still got to
[32:58] have faith that god will do that because
[33:00] you and i can't
[33:02] you and i cannot forget we were talking
[33:04] about last night you and i cannot forget
[33:05] what we did like god just takes the
[33:07] slate and wipes it off
[33:08] he can't remember it anymore for an
[33:10] eternity
[33:12] amen
[33:13] see if god's forgetfulness never to be
[33:16] remembered again
[33:18] all right but you and i remember and
[33:19] that's the fight that we have going up
[33:21] that statue of perfect man is it's like
[33:23] i was saying last night it's not virtue
[33:26] that you live a virgin life never
[33:27] touched a man that man's never touched
[33:29] you you you uh
[33:32] no it's the virtue of god it's the
[33:34] strength of god it's the virtue that you
[33:36] get from the holy ghost not that you get
[33:37] because you're this
[33:39] all right there's going to be many
[33:40] virgins in hell
[33:44] but if you don't accept the lord jesus
[33:46] christ it doesn't matter
[33:48] if you don't accept him as your savior
[33:50] you are going to hell one of the you
[33:51] know one of the two it's not an
[33:52] in-between there's not a purgatory to go
[33:54] to or something that you get in the
[33:56] middle of and you know one or the other
[33:59] but the work of justification is in your
[34:01] soul
[34:02] then sanctification is in your soul he
[34:04] clean the unclean spirit has to go out
[34:06] of your soul
[34:07] the old nature this is where we talk
[34:09] about the renewing of our mind do you
[34:11] know what you're doing today is totally
[34:13] contrary to god
[34:17] what you're doing today you say what me
[34:18] i'm doing you're thinking bad thoughts
[34:21] you had to eat this morning you had to
[34:23] put on clothes you i hope some of you
[34:25] took a bath
[34:26] right it's all contrary to god that's
[34:28] not the purpose of god god didn't put
[34:30] you on here put you on the earth
[34:32] to do this this is all permissive will
[34:35] of god it's not the perfect will of god
[34:37] the perfect will of god is when we walk
[34:38] into the future home and we don't have
[34:40] any sorrow no heartaches we don't need
[34:42] faith
[34:45] we didn't need adam didn't need faith
[34:47] he was faith
[34:49] all right so that's what we're coming
[34:51] back to right jesus didn't need faith he
[34:53] was faith
[34:55] why because he didn't have a carnal mind
[34:56] he didn't have a he didn't have to have
[34:58] his mind renewed now there was thoughts
[35:00] that came to his mind
[35:02] that he couldn't help hello somebody he
[35:04] was human
[35:05] brother brown said he could have been a
[35:07] father he could have been a husband
[35:11] so he was ever wit human
[35:13] but he didn't have a carnal mind he
[35:15] didn't lean back and say well my mama
[35:17] well my daddy
[35:20] hello somebody
[35:23] i do this because my mama always did it
[35:25] my daddy always did it boy my uncle he
[35:28] just ruined me no you ruined yourself
[35:34] all right so the sanctification the
[35:36] unclean spirit goes out
[35:37] walks in dry places seeks red finest nun
[35:40] and then brother brown says god what
[35:41] does he do he comes in and gives you a
[35:43] new spirit
[35:44] which is not the holy spirit because
[35:46] remember sanctification is cleaned and
[35:48] set aside for service not put in service
[35:51] never with me
[35:52] all right but now it's potentially there
[35:55] the potential is there to put you in
[35:57] service
[35:58] but
[35:59] you
[36:00] you
[36:01] have got to keep that demon out
[36:04] because he's going to come back to his
[36:05] house the bible says in there in luke i
[36:08] believe it is we've been reading it
[36:10] where he says i'll come back into my
[36:12] house cause it's still he's still got
[36:14] his dirty hands around me and you until
[36:16] god baptizes you with the holy ghost
[36:19] you're satan's
[36:22] son
[36:26] because you're not a son of god yet
[36:28] oh in the mind of god yes you are but to
[36:30] be a child of god i just read it you got
[36:33] to be born again
[36:35] you got to come to a place and realize
[36:37] that you are born by the what breath of
[36:39] god you're born by the word of god
[36:41] you're not born by your mom and daddy
[36:43] anymore amen
[36:44] they can't even birth you twice
[36:53] think about that
[36:55] because that's what nicodemus said
[36:57] he said have i got to go back and get
[36:59] into my mother's womb and be born again
[37:01] just like no and jesus was like man come
[37:03] on you're a teacher from israel you're
[37:06] the teacher you should know these things
[37:08] no you got to be born from above
[37:10] how many of us really know that we've
[37:12] been born from above
[37:14] i mean really you think about well i've
[37:15] got to i've got you know i got this and
[37:17] i got this and like i said i get this
[37:20] hereditary from
[37:22] well
[37:24] let's look at the heritage that god gave
[37:26] you
[37:27] it trumps all the heritage that your mom
[37:30] and daddy gave you
[37:31] it trumps all the heritage of your dales
[37:33] and caches that i'm connected to it
[37:36] trumps every bit of that
[37:39] have you ever thought about that because
[37:40] you lean on those you say well i got
[37:42] diabetes because my mama doesn't know
[37:44] you got diabetes because you eat too
[37:45] much
[37:48] sorry
[37:51] you control your own destiny folks
[37:55] i can't help it because now that's it
[37:57] find me that in the bible where it says
[37:58] i can't help it because
[38:01] i think the bible when when mary
[38:05] stood there with the impossible
[38:09] i don't know a man
[38:12] and the angel said with god
[38:14] all things are possible
[38:16] he'll say just some things
[38:18] all things are possible you know what
[38:20] she said be it unto me according to that
[38:22] word
[38:23] amen and then what happened boom
[38:25] the promise of god happened to a virgin
[38:27] called mary
[38:28] but he said he'd give you a new spirit
[38:30] and that spirit isn't god's spirit but
[38:31] listen i'm trying to drive this home
[38:33] because
[38:35] even the ones that baptize and the
[38:36] different ones that are sitting here
[38:38] we look
[38:39] we want everybody to be born again we
[38:41] don't want everybody to feel good
[38:43] we don't want everybody to be perfect
[38:45] yet we don't want everybody to to come
[38:48] every once in a while
[38:50] right
[38:51] i want you to realize you're either born
[38:52] again or you're not
[38:55] and your desire should be to read the
[38:57] word of god come to church we're sheep
[39:00] we have to be led sorry that's the way
[39:02] god said it i can't say it no other way
[39:05] for the perfecting of the saints he give
[39:07] us apostles prophets pastors teachers
[39:09] and evangelists now that's in the word
[39:10] of god because you know what we've got
[39:12] to believe that because there's some
[39:14] people don't believe it
[39:16] and you know what that makes you if you
[39:17] don't believe the word of god you become
[39:18] an unbeliever
[39:21] amen
[39:22] you become an unbeliever well i don't
[39:24] believe i gotta come to church twice
[39:26] you
[39:27] don't believe that's not what god said
[39:30] right
[39:32] well i think that's your first problem
[39:37] i think
[39:39] what's the bible saying
[39:41] the word of god say
[39:43] i can read it to you out of the bible
[39:44] this is not something sure we have a
[39:46] think about this the other day we do in
[39:48] the economy of this church and every
[39:49] other church they have an economy of of
[39:52] that well we don't we don't want you to
[39:54] chewing gum in church you know and we
[39:56] don't want you to drink any drinks in
[39:57] church and and we don't want you to do
[39:59] this now that's just common things
[40:04] but when it comes to this you can't
[40:05] change everybody's got to be the same
[40:08] all right everybody's got to be the same
[40:12] for satan not assembling yourself
[40:13] together
[40:16] i keep harping on that but if you don't
[40:18] come to church if you don't come to
[40:19] church some of you don't even come 50 of
[40:21] the time you're lost
[40:23] get the new birth
[40:25] it will put you in church
[40:28] it will not tell you to not go to church
[40:32] the new birth can't tell you that
[40:34] because he'll be contrary to his own
[40:36] word
[40:37] i can't change this
[40:39] you say why ask god i know why
[40:42] ask god to give you the new birth and i
[40:44] promise you he'll tell you why
[40:47] you struggle in your life cause you
[40:48] don't come to church
[40:52] i can see it we can all see it it's just
[40:54] if you don't show up for church it's
[40:56] like
[40:57] okay
[41:01] but look folks you're judging your own
[41:03] self it's not somebody else judging you
[41:05] you're judging your own self
[41:07] amen
[41:09] and it's just like i said last night
[41:11] the bible tells us in our age to buy
[41:14] isaf
[41:15] the bible tells us that there's five
[41:18] wise and five foolish virgins and those
[41:20] five foolish virgins
[41:21] at one time they couldn't get oil
[41:26] when i get finished drinking this
[41:27] there's no more
[41:30] there's gonna be a day come when we come
[41:32] up to this church or any other time in
[41:34] our life and god's gonna say that's
[41:36] enough
[41:40] and there'll be no more
[41:42] there'll be no more water there'll be no
[41:44] be no more i salve there'll be no more
[41:46] holy ghost given out
[41:49] i'm sorry
[41:50] if you
[41:51] if you think well
[41:53] you're talking to me yeah i am
[41:56] but it's not me talking
[41:58] it's god telling you what the word says
[42:00] all right
[42:01] buy of me i said
[42:03] bye
[42:05] come and get you got to come and get it
[42:11] draw nine to me and i'll draw nine to
[42:13] you well it's really simple
[42:16] now what we want to do is sit home
[42:18] with our feet up on the
[42:20] couch
[42:21] and say god bring me the blessings
[42:26] no you're going to get the curses
[42:27] because you're not you're not what
[42:29] you're becoming an unbeliever you're not
[42:30] believing just what the simple word of
[42:32] god says
[42:35] it didn't take william brown to tell us
[42:37] we need to come to church
[42:40] bible said it
[42:42] and you know what if god put it in the
[42:44] bible there's no way he can change
[42:47] and he put it in there for a purpose
[42:50] for us to live by it
[42:52] pete come on wake up
[42:55] if it looks like a donkey smells like a
[42:56] donkey and honks like a donkey what is
[42:59] it what is it um
[43:01] hudson it's a donkey
[43:04] we got a donkey that braves all the time
[43:06] he go you know you know
[43:08] you know what do you know when that
[43:10] thing goes you know we don't go where's
[43:12] that duck
[43:14] where'd that duck go
[43:16] no we know that come from a
[43:19] yeah
[43:21] a donkey
[43:24] looks like one smells like one acts like
[43:26] one that's what it is
[43:27] if you look like the world smell like
[43:28] the world night like the world you're of
[43:30] the world
[43:32] but if you look like god act like god
[43:35] you must be god
[43:37] faith and works have to work together
[43:39] amen
[43:42] balance
[43:44] i got all faiths
[43:47] i got a quote by terry i'll read it a
[43:48] couple of sundays from now brother brown
[43:50] says if you got faith you need to let it
[43:53] he told one sister in the prayer line i
[43:55] got it it was reading it just few
[43:56] minutes ago he said sister you've got
[43:58] faith you're just not letting it out
[44:04] you've got faith
[44:05] if you're born again she was a christian
[44:07] lady
[44:08] lady you got faith just let it out
[44:12] and obviously she did because she got
[44:13] her healing
[44:14] but it just takes what it just took a
[44:16] preacher to say hey you got it you got
[44:17] faith but it's locked up
[44:19] you got it locked up by what
[44:22] your mind like we said before brother
[44:24] brown said a prostitute can come across
[44:26] the stage been with a you know 100
[44:28] different men just to blow life drunk
[44:31] whatever and get her healing
[44:33] and a true saint of god will come across
[44:35] the platform and miss hers why because
[44:37] the prostitute in her mind
[44:40] she said i'm going to believe what that
[44:41] guy says and then see then god's got to
[44:43] say if you believe what i say
[44:46] i'll heal you no other condition
[44:49] but a christian comes up and says
[44:52] oh i said something bad i cut somebody
[44:53] off in the road i'm just unworthy i'm
[44:55] not this i'm not that and you worry
[44:57] about that and you lose your healing
[45:00] because of what because of a carnal mind
[45:02] i hope this is okay
[45:05] he said he'd give you a new spirit
[45:07] all right so so we watch these things
[45:10] and and being being in the ministry and
[45:12] different that you watch
[45:14] i take the 19 that was baptized
[45:17] have they changed some have some haven't
[45:20] i'm just saying you know the 19 and that
[45:22] you know you can point your finger if
[45:24] you want to but there was 19 people been
[45:26] baptized some don't show back up again
[45:32] some are moving on with god
[45:35] i don't have to pick them out
[45:38] god picks them out
[45:39] the word of god the mirror brother
[45:41] around what do you always say the mirror
[45:42] of the word
[45:44] you stand in front of that mirror i was
[45:46] thinking the other day
[45:51] try to say this where everybody will
[45:52] understand it
[45:53] because when i think in my mind
[45:54] sometimes you might not understand what
[45:56] i'm thinking
[45:57] but we we harp on people being
[46:02] um
[46:03] qualified to preach or qualified to do
[46:05] this or qualify to do the other
[46:08] and we say that fornication is an
[46:09] abomination right that's the bible says
[46:11] fornication abomination
[46:14] but now you take abomination
[46:17] we know what fornication is unclean
[46:18] living sexually
[46:20] we take that out of the way because we
[46:21] know what that is but what
[46:24] the bible tells you sisters that is an
[46:26] abomination for you to put on clothes
[46:29] pertaining to a man we don't read them
[46:31] parts
[46:32] so you're under the same abomination
[46:35] because if it's one abomination to god
[46:37] all of them are abomination to god
[46:39] that's why you're an unbeliever when you
[46:41] do that that's why that when you cut
[46:43] your hair you've cut yourself off from
[46:45] god
[46:47] because why because you don't believe
[46:50] that that part of the word's right
[46:53] you don't believe and how many of you
[46:55] you know you you witnessed the people
[46:57] why do you where you well that's in
[46:58] deuteronomy 29 or whatever do you
[47:00] remember 19. well that's in the old
[47:01] testament what that matters in the bible
[47:04] so it's the ten commandments do you live
[47:06] by them
[47:08] amen correct but he'll give you a new
[47:11] spirit that new spirit will you watch
[47:13] those i was thinking
[47:16] yesterday
[47:18] we're in i told him last night you are
[47:20] influenced by a spirit i don't care if
[47:22] you're born again you're influenced by
[47:24] the spirit of the world we brother brown
[47:26] said america had a spirit that's right
[47:29] look at it entertainment we love
[47:31] entertainment
[47:32] we love sports we wear our favorite
[47:35] jerseys
[47:38] we go to our favorite places
[47:40] we have our favorite things to eat
[47:44] that's the spirit that motivates you not
[47:46] saying bad or good but there's a spirit
[47:47] that motivates everything you do
[47:50] everything you do amen
[47:53] now some holy and some is not
[47:57] but towards the divine line the word
[47:59] what the word of god says
[48:01] seek ye first the kingdom of heaven
[48:04] then if you want to go to a ball game go
[48:05] ahead but don't make it on sunday
[48:08] balance
[48:10] balance
[48:11] balance
[48:13] listen the prophet of god had to go to a
[48:15] ball game because he was telling about
[48:16] the guy getting so happy
[48:18] and and a lot of you young people don't
[48:20] know this but if you look at old
[48:21] baseball games
[48:23] people used to wear straw hats not the
[48:26] ones like people wear now but they're
[48:28] they're they're flat rimmed like this
[48:30] not a fedora
[48:32] flat rimmed and with a square thing and
[48:34] it's all made out of
[48:36] of a thatched material
[48:39] go look at all the ball games you'll see
[48:40] them well brother ryan says one guy took
[48:42] and put his head through one of them
[48:44] they were so happy remember oh no well
[48:46] he had to see that
[48:48] he said the guy got so happy he reached
[48:50] and got his hat and if you can't if you
[48:51] do it strong enough you just pull it
[48:52] right down over somebody's head and that
[48:54] top pops off of it
[48:56] y'all laugh if you want to but just go
[48:57] back and put in about 19 30 for a
[48:59] baseball game about where brother adam
[49:01] would be watching baseball games you'll
[49:02] see all them people with them straw hats
[49:04] on i don't know what they were called
[49:05] but he must have been there to see it a
[49:07] prophet yeah a prophet
[49:10] but i'll put my spirit in him
[49:13] it begins to divide
[49:17] the bible says dividing the word of
[49:19] truth
[49:20] and dividing gives you measures
[49:24] right
[49:25] you don't just say i'm gonna put a
[49:27] gallon of milk make one make one cake
[49:29] i'm just well
[49:30] one gallon you know
[49:33] you know like dad his uh his his
[49:35] philosophy is if two nails holds a two
[49:37] by four good 17 holds it 17 times better
[49:40] he just don't know he splintered the
[49:41] whole bottom of the two before
[49:43] so
[49:44] or if one quartz good two quarts is
[49:47] twice as good no you can't overfill your
[49:49] motor in your car now he never did that
[49:51] that's something that i think i did one
[49:53] time so
[49:54] i was influenced by my wife
[49:56] so um
[50:01] i'm just kidding
[50:03] but then the way we are though
[50:06] you do some goofy something and you give
[50:07] it you tell well god that wasn't my
[50:10] fault
[50:12] she made me do that
[50:15] no you did it
[50:20] but they'll give you a new spirit
[50:22] that new spirit
[50:24] will change you
[50:27] that new spirit even that new spirit
[50:29] that's not the holy spirit
[50:31] see you're waiting on the holy spirit to
[50:33] come to make you to make you
[50:35] born again or religious or act right no
[50:39] they got it wrong in the message
[50:44] you got to get rid of the things you did
[50:45] at sanctification those old
[50:48] unclean spirits have got to be
[50:51] rendered out of your soul
[50:53] and when they're rendered out of your
[50:55] soul it changes
[50:57] your mind it changes your spirit it
[51:00] changes your attitude toward who god
[51:06] it changes you
[51:09] the change doesn't begin at the new
[51:11] birth
[51:14] the change begins at sanctification
[51:17] i'll put my spirit in him then though is
[51:20] the holy spirit all right
[51:23] read it right there god gives you a new
[51:24] spirit then he says i'll put my spirit
[51:26] in him now what if he gives you a new
[51:28] spirit and then you invite all them
[51:29] olins back
[51:35] that can happen because you know what
[51:36] it's not sealed yet
[51:38] i'm drinking this so i can put my dirty
[51:39] finger down in here
[51:41] but why can't i
[51:42] it's not sealed
[51:44] the devil's going to come right back in
[51:47] and make you seven times more religious
[51:48] put you in a message church
[51:51] but you will not endure to the end
[51:55] you will i'm sorry you will disappear
[51:57] from the congregation
[52:00] if you make a move for god and then you
[52:02] stop and you don't continue on with god
[52:06] regardless of what devil tells you
[52:09] regardless of what your neighbor tells
[52:10] you and listen not regardless of what
[52:12] this man telling you because i believe
[52:14] i'm telling you the truth just like
[52:15] brother dale told you it's true for all
[52:16] those years you've got to be born again
[52:20] before it totally changes your life but
[52:23] it's got to start its sanctification
[52:26] because justification look justification
[52:28] i
[52:29] ain't getting nowhere justification is
[52:31] the unclean spirit gone out of you
[52:34] man i felt so good
[52:36] because i believed
[52:40] faith
[52:42] in what i heard
[52:44] that he would
[52:45] take my sin
[52:47] and put him in the sea of god's
[52:49] forgetfulness
[52:50] never to be remembered again
[52:53] and whether i ever think of him again or
[52:55] not
[52:56] god has no thought of them
[52:59] because he loved me from the beginning
[53:03] he knew i'd want him more than life
[53:05] itself
[53:06] he knew i'd come to one day when i would
[53:08] be sick and tired of being sick and
[53:09] tired and who was i sick and tired of me
[53:17] have you ever come to that yet if you
[53:18] have never come to that yet you need to
[53:20] get born again
[53:22] get sick and tired of what you're doing
[53:26] listen who's our worst enemy the devil
[53:28] no
[53:29] you are
[53:31] you and i are our worst enemy
[53:35] listen god wants to save the whole world
[53:39] and if he saw that in his mind it would
[53:41] have happened but he knew that even if
[53:43] he gave somebody like adolf hitler a
[53:45] million years to repent adolf hitler
[53:47] would still be a killer a million years
[53:50] if as much as he was when he died he'd
[53:52] be a killer a million years from now
[53:54] because he never would change
[53:56] he never would what get the unclean
[53:58] spirit out
[54:00] he loved him
[54:02] brother brown says they said brother
[54:03] brown why did that woman get cancer
[54:04] again why did that woman get the um
[54:08] epileptic or whatever it was it came
[54:10] back on her in other words he said
[54:11] because she loved it
[54:14] it was draw it was driven out by god
[54:17] but her she didn't have enough faith to
[54:19] keep it away
[54:21] remember brother brown said you can be
[54:22] healed of cancer today and die tomorrow
[54:24] what
[54:26] it's temporary
[54:29] but this spirit when you get the spirit
[54:31] of god it changes you and you know what
[54:34] people will see that change
[54:38] people will see that change you know why
[54:41] because you've changed
[54:44] ain't now why people see change because
[54:46] you changed
[54:50] right
[54:52] but the thing god has to do is give you
[54:54] a new spirit make your nature see he's
[54:57] working on your nature
[54:59] a little more gentle this is before the
[55:01] new birth
[55:04] this is before he seals you where
[55:07] nothing else can get in or out
[55:10] and then he puts you in service
[55:13] he's not going to put you in service
[55:14] because he always there's an option
[55:18] something can get back in and only god
[55:21] knows in his mind whether you let it get
[55:22] back in or not
[55:24] it's not god letting it back in you let
[55:26] it back in
[55:27] and that's what happens you get a
[55:29] brother brown i read you that quote
[55:30] several times where brother brown said
[55:31] we get a real good case of
[55:33] sanctification
[55:34] we shout we speak in tongues or we we
[55:37] just get happy in the lord and
[55:40] then we never see him again
[55:43] now
[55:44] that was nothing new birth
[55:46] that might have been some sanctification
[55:48] going on
[55:49] but the unclean spirit came back in just
[55:51] a little bit later and took him right
[55:53] back out
[55:54] i hate to see that
[55:56] but you know what there's absolutely
[55:58] nothing you can do but just pray for
[55:59] people
[56:00] that's all you can do
[56:03] why would i want to drive my mama tried
[56:05] to drag me to church for 20 years
[56:07] i mean she wanted me saved i mean every
[56:09] mama would want but
[56:11] didn't do me a bit of good
[56:13] didn't do me a bit of good
[56:15] if you come on christmas and easter
[56:17] you need to get bored again
[56:20] if you only come at christmas and easter
[56:22] because that was me the c and e crowd
[56:24] you know the christmas and easter crowd
[56:25] you show up and
[56:27] sorry mother's day
[56:28] you better show up on mother's day
[56:33] you better show up when the door's open
[56:36] that's what brother branham said
[56:38] we love the quote like we were talking
[56:40] before we love the seals and the daniel
[56:42] 70 weeks and what we going to eat in the
[56:44] millennium and what's this and that the
[56:46] other but do you even come to church
[56:49] do you even read your bible
[56:52] do you even pray more now than you did
[56:53] before because that new spirit is going
[56:55] to push you toward doing that it's not
[56:58] gonna listen the old one that got cast
[57:00] out of you is the one that took you in
[57:02] this direction
[57:03] all right
[57:05] but that new spirit is heading you
[57:06] brother brown said you get a new spirit
[57:08] he said
[57:09] your name goes on the book at
[57:10] sanctification what a book a book of
[57:12] religion a religious spirit
[57:15] but you be careful that's got to be
[57:17] turned from a religious spirit into
[57:20] god's spirit because satan has a
[57:22] religious spirit
[57:24] he knows how that is and he'll pile it
[57:27] on you
[57:28] and you'll think it's god
[57:30] because see remember the bible says he
[57:32] wants to sit in the temple of god
[57:34] showing himself to be
[57:36] as god
[57:37] where's the temple of god
[57:41] right here
[57:42] the temple of god's right here it's not
[57:44] a temple
[57:46] the temple of god's right here this is
[57:48] where satan wants to this is where he
[57:49] wants his seat and he'll get it with the
[57:52] antichrist the beast he'll get that seed
[57:56] and then like we were talking about in
[57:57] daniel 70 weeks he'll break that
[57:58] covenant and then all hell's going to
[57:59] break loose but we're not here
[58:02] thank god
[58:03] what we have what got the new spirit and
[58:06] then got
[58:07] went on further and got the holy ghost
[58:10] seeing that you purified your souls and
[58:12] obeying the truth
[58:16] what did samuel tell saul
[58:18] obedience is better than sacrifice
[58:22] so i said oh but but saw but samuel i
[58:27] i brought so many thousand heads of
[58:29] sheep and we can sacrifice them to the
[58:32] lord
[58:34] right
[58:35] oh we're gonna save these two kings
[58:37] because we're gonna make them suffer
[58:40] we've destroyed their kingdom
[58:42] samuel says
[58:43] i hear the blatant of the sheep
[58:46] and then saul tells them all that good
[58:48] stuff which sounds good
[58:50] but samuel says no
[58:53] i told you god told you through me
[58:56] kill them all
[58:58] kill all the animals
[59:00] definitely get the kings out of the way
[59:01] because what samuel do oh what a good
[59:03] prophet he was
[59:05] he pulled a sword
[59:07] listen samuel was not something that
[59:09] just set in a cave
[59:10] he knew how to use a sword because he
[59:12] took them two kings put his foot on one
[59:15] of them and he goes
[59:17] put his foot on the other one
[59:20] wiped his sword off and said that's what
[59:22] god told you to do but you didn't do it
[59:24] he said but now he said your kingdom has
[59:26] been rendered away from you because you
[59:27] did what obey
[59:30] obedience is better than sacrifice all
[59:33] right so that's what it says right here
[59:35] you obey the truth what is the truth the
[59:38] truth's the word of god
[59:41] well i don't know if i see i don't know
[59:44] no i do you get the new birth you'll
[59:46] know
[59:48] you'll know that that something inside
[59:50] of you is pulling you off that tightrope
[59:53] you've been on all your life
[59:55] onto some good solid ground
[59:58] but you got to have faith in what god's
[59:59] already said not what god's saying
[1:00:01] that's what god's already said
[1:00:03] seeing you have purified your souls
[1:00:06] talking about the soul now not the
[1:00:07] spirit
[1:00:08] you've purified your souls in obeying
[1:00:10] the truth
[1:00:11] through the spirit unto unfeigned or
[1:00:14] or no
[1:00:15] there's no up and down
[1:00:17] unfeigned love
[1:00:19] of the brethren see that you love one
[1:00:21] another with a pure heart
[1:00:23] fervently
[1:00:24] being born again not a corruptible seed
[1:00:27] you were born of corruptible seed i'm
[1:00:28] looking at it right now
[1:00:33] but by the word of god the incorruptible
[1:00:37] seed or the word of god which what
[1:00:39] liveth
[1:00:40] and abide this forever
[1:00:42] ephesians 1 we talk about being
[1:00:44] predestinated you and i are
[1:00:46] predestinated this journey put us in
[1:00:48] here
[1:00:49] right here today
[1:00:52] so you're predestinated for a purpose we
[1:00:53] know that right in whom also you trusted
[1:00:56] look after you heard the word of truth
[1:00:58] how are you going to how are you going
[1:00:59] to trust in something you never heard
[1:01:01] you got to hear the word of truth that's
[1:01:03] what convicts you
[1:01:05] because if you read a book by
[1:01:07] um charles darwin you read a book by
[1:01:10] um
[1:01:11] some good
[1:01:12] just to some good novelist
[1:01:16] that's not mean nothing
[1:01:18] how many times when you when i was in
[1:01:20] the world i like to read books and i'd
[1:01:22] read books by certain authors different
[1:01:23] ones you know
[1:01:25] i can't remember one of them
[1:01:27] but i sure can remember some of the
[1:01:28] things i've read out of this
[1:01:31] because it's ingrained in my soul
[1:01:33] all that other stuff is just okay good
[1:01:35] thoughts and all that stuff the only
[1:01:36] book i ever remember that i read that i
[1:01:38] really liked was i don't even know the
[1:01:39] author but it was called children or
[1:01:41] like wet cement
[1:01:44] children are like wet cement the
[1:01:47] impression you make before the cement
[1:01:49] sets up stays with it how many times
[1:01:51] have you
[1:01:52] built something on i know we built
[1:01:54] something at the house and and zach
[1:01:56] which is grown now
[1:01:57] he put his little old handprint you know
[1:01:59] what still there
[1:02:01] and if we would go up up at
[1:02:03] guildsville where
[1:02:04] daddy built that house in 64. we all had
[1:02:07] our little handprints in that
[1:02:09] amen
[1:02:11] it's still there
[1:02:12] because there was an impression made
[1:02:14] before it's set up
[1:02:16] so that's why we need to get our kids we
[1:02:18] need to teach them right teach them to
[1:02:20] say thank you
[1:02:22] teach them to say yes sir no sir yes
[1:02:25] ma'am no ma'am
[1:02:28] thank you goes a long way
[1:02:33] thank you
[1:02:34] see you there make you feel better thank
[1:02:35] you
[1:02:38] but this is all going to happen after
[1:02:39] you heard the word of truth the gospel
[1:02:41] of your salvation whom also after that
[1:02:43] you believed so you got to have faith
[1:02:46] we read it before we read it again
[1:02:47] there's that big thing called faith is
[1:02:50] as louise was talking about the leaning
[1:02:51] tower pizza you were using pizza and
[1:02:53] then you took pizza what you got peace
[1:02:56] on your mind brother must remember he
[1:02:58] used a piece of pizza as the pyramid
[1:03:00] then he goes to the leaning tower of
[1:03:02] pisa which is in pisa italy right and
[1:03:04] that's where pizza anyway so you see how
[1:03:07] that spirit got on him this morning
[1:03:10] that pepperoni demon
[1:03:13] i'm hungry he said i'm hungry
[1:03:16] well let's get hungry for the word of
[1:03:17] god first all right let's get influenced
[1:03:19] by that spirit that's why that's why
[1:03:21] when you come to church that's why you
[1:03:23] are either better or worse it took a
[1:03:25] prophet
[1:03:26] that could look into another dimension
[1:03:30] everybody with me it took a profit that
[1:03:32] could look into another dimension and he
[1:03:33] said i could see demons hanging off the
[1:03:35] rafters when i'd go into a place
[1:03:38] went to a motel one time and he said i
[1:03:40] need to change rooms they said why he
[1:03:41] said there was adultery committed in
[1:03:43] there and that spirit's still in there
[1:03:46] and you and me we just go oh it's a good
[1:03:48] room what's going on in you know
[1:03:50] but he but he
[1:03:52] is conscious we were talking about last
[1:03:53] night our conscience is sometimes just
[1:03:55] far apart
[1:03:56] we were talking about having dreams
[1:03:58] but his conscience was right here
[1:04:00] he didn't know whether he was in this
[1:04:02] realm or he was in this room but see
[1:04:03] that was his gift but see god allowed
[1:04:06] him to go into that so that he can tell
[1:04:08] me and you that right now
[1:04:10] we're being influenced by spirits
[1:04:13] everywhere you go you're influenced by a
[1:04:15] spirit somewhere
[1:04:17] it's which one you lean towards which
[1:04:19] dog you feed the most is the one that's
[1:04:22] gonna take listen
[1:04:24] satan is powerless
[1:04:27] right
[1:04:29] you give him the power
[1:04:32] satan is powerless
[1:04:34] before the church of god but the church
[1:04:36] of god is letting him in the door
[1:04:40] i'm sorry in all of us
[1:04:42] the little things that we do and the
[1:04:44] little things that we don't confess
[1:04:46] look which is the earnest see that's the
[1:04:48] earnest of our inheritance when we come
[1:04:50] to this new birth when we come to this
[1:04:52] getting this spirit of god inside of us
[1:04:54] and and by that time we should be able
[1:04:56] to be comfortable with the spirit of god
[1:04:58] how many of you before you got born
[1:04:59] again was comfortable in the church
[1:05:04] put the camera on these people
[1:05:06] how many of you were comfortable
[1:05:09] going to church well mama would call me
[1:05:11] and she'd say son it's mother's day you
[1:05:13] need to be in church
[1:05:15] i got to shaken
[1:05:18] because i didn't want to be in church
[1:05:20] i knew there was some good people there
[1:05:23] i knew there was spirits that would
[1:05:25] influence me to be good and i didn't
[1:05:26] want that
[1:05:28] i'm just being honest
[1:05:30] are you
[1:05:32] i didn't want to come to church because
[1:05:33] it wasn't comfortable
[1:05:35] right
[1:05:36] you know where i was comfortable where
[1:05:38] the devil was
[1:05:40] i was out in the world i was so
[1:05:41] comfortable going to
[1:05:43] xyz so were y'all
[1:05:45] comfortable with the cigarette
[1:05:47] comfortable with the beer
[1:05:48] why because we were influenced by that
[1:05:50] spirit and actually we were influenced
[1:05:52] by the big one that was down inside
[1:05:57] either faith or doubt
[1:05:59] today you either got god in your soul or
[1:06:01] the devil in your soul one of the two
[1:06:03] you're no gray area there either
[1:06:06] the only gray area is maybe when you
[1:06:08] pass through sanctification but you
[1:06:09] don't continue on you're going to drop
[1:06:11] back
[1:06:13] to that other spirit
[1:06:15] but we are influenced by spirits we'll
[1:06:17] get in a little bit more because to go
[1:06:19] up the statue of perfect man's like i
[1:06:20] said it took a prophet
[1:06:22] to go
[1:06:24] you see that demon of cancer
[1:06:26] he's screaming to that demon over here
[1:06:29] for help
[1:06:30] there's a black streak and he said i can
[1:06:32] hear him screaming now the people and
[1:06:34] you know brother ryan said can't you see
[1:06:35] that light over that person well there's
[1:06:37] nobody can see no light over nobody
[1:06:40] right
[1:06:41] i mean some of you were sitting in the
[1:06:43] meetings and you were trying to go
[1:06:46] ain't there because your eyes couldn't
[1:06:48] see it
[1:06:50] but it's real
[1:06:52] today you got a lick of fire
[1:06:54] and it's not hanging over you it's
[1:06:56] burning inside if you got the new birth
[1:06:59] there's still spirits hanging around you
[1:07:03] influencing you
[1:07:05] well i don't think i want to hear him
[1:07:06] again i'll just find me somewhere else
[1:07:07] to go
[1:07:10] later gator
[1:07:12] devil
[1:07:14] you got your day coming don't worry
[1:07:18] don't you know that everything he put on
[1:07:19] us
[1:07:21] we're going to keep it back on him
[1:07:24] and he's going to have to keep it on him
[1:07:26] we're going to get rid of him he's not
[1:07:28] going to bother us anymore
[1:07:32] john 14 says these things have i spoken
[1:07:34] unto you being yet present but the
[1:07:36] comforter why would god send a comforter
[1:07:39] who's got oh
[1:07:40] christine's got a a
[1:07:43] comforter around her
[1:07:45] she's cold
[1:07:47] and listen if y'all gonna go with us on
[1:07:48] that bus you better bring you a
[1:07:49] comforter
[1:07:51] cause i'm turning the air conditioner
[1:07:52] down
[1:07:54] you will not die you might freeze but
[1:07:55] you ain't gonna die but bring you a
[1:07:57] comforter what but what does a comforter
[1:07:58] do
[1:07:59] makes you warm
[1:08:01] it gives you what comfort
[1:08:03] the holy ghost is to give you comfort
[1:08:05] it's not to scare you
[1:08:08] it's not to scare you it's not to give
[1:08:09] you the spirit of fear anymore i've
[1:08:11] lived with a spirit of fear long enough
[1:08:15] we want liberty we want to be able to
[1:08:17] feel good we want to feel the pull
[1:08:19] we felt the pull of the world long
[1:08:21] enough
[1:08:22] but we had a prophet to tell us
[1:08:24] there's three pulls
[1:08:27] and they're not pushes
[1:08:30] we we want to push people into it but
[1:08:32] it's three pulls
[1:08:34] where god is pulling you as brother
[1:08:36] louise was talking about
[1:08:37] that rope
[1:08:39] but that over there is where it's
[1:08:41] pulling me
[1:08:43] and that was good brother louise and
[1:08:45] brother branham even tells us about how
[1:08:47] the little boy rode the bicycle on a
[1:08:49] little bitty board
[1:08:51] i mean you have to try that
[1:08:53] don't ever look down at the board if
[1:08:55] you're driving a car don't ever look
[1:08:56] across the hood and look straight down
[1:08:58] into the ground you'll be doing this
[1:09:01] where do you look you look from here to
[1:09:02] the door 30 40 feet away from you and
[1:09:04] you stay straight as a string you all
[1:09:06] didn't know you was going to get a
[1:09:07] driver's ed course today did you
[1:09:10] but that's the truth and that's the same
[1:09:11] way with god if we look at every little
[1:09:14] circumstance
[1:09:15] that we come upon
[1:09:17] and we go oh i don't know now look at
[1:09:19] the prize look at what we're heading
[1:09:21] toward
[1:09:22] you're going to have problems you that
[1:09:24] that that um cable is going to wobble
[1:09:27] there you go
[1:09:29] because of your life
[1:09:31] but look at the
[1:09:32] prize out there
[1:09:35] is solid ground
[1:09:37] there's no spirit of fear
[1:09:39] there's a comforter which is the holy
[1:09:41] ghost whom the father
[1:09:43] will send in my name he shall teach you
[1:09:45] all things and bring all things to your
[1:09:46] remembrance whatsoever i have said
[1:09:50] unto you
[1:09:52] acts 1 verse 4 says but you shall
[1:09:53] receive power or dunamis after that the
[1:09:55] holy ghost has come upon you in other
[1:09:57] words you're powerless before
[1:09:59] hello
[1:10:01] you shall receive power after that the
[1:10:03] holy ghost has come upon you and you
[1:10:05] shall be witnesses unto me in jerusalem
[1:10:07] in judea and samaria
[1:10:08] and the uttermost parts of the earth and
[1:10:10] we know that means dunamis and power
[1:10:12] let's continue on
[1:10:14] now what brother brown what is the
[1:10:15] evidence of the holy ghost now we know
[1:10:17] that brother brown said it was a
[1:10:18] personal revelation to you in christ the
[1:10:20] mystery of god revealed but i believe he
[1:10:21] really summed it up right here
[1:10:23] in this message
[1:10:25] in the smyrna church age
[1:10:27] oh grief this is in the church age book
[1:10:29] some of y'all that don't believe in it
[1:10:30] just turn it off
[1:10:32] you're crazy if you do
[1:10:34] you're doing away with the very word of
[1:10:36] god if you do away with that church age
[1:10:38] book
[1:10:39] you're doing away with an integral part
[1:10:41] of your christianity if you do away with
[1:10:43] that book
[1:10:44] amen i don't care if it's a woman's book
[1:10:47] doesn't matter
[1:10:49] brother branham approved it before he
[1:10:50] died he read it said
[1:10:52] publish it
[1:10:54] i trust his discernment not them other
[1:10:55] peoples
[1:10:57] he told us the evidence that what would
[1:10:58] happen after being baptized after
[1:11:01] being baptized with the holy ghost was
[1:11:03] that we would have the teacher come and
[1:11:06] teach us all truth
[1:11:09] but that teacher was an inside teacher
[1:11:11] not an outside teacher now you say well
[1:11:13] then brother i can sit at home and i can
[1:11:15] just listen to tapes and i can press
[1:11:18] play and yeah you might be able to do
[1:11:20] that but your inside teacher didn't tell
[1:11:21] you to do that
[1:11:23] if you got the holy ghost your inside
[1:11:25] teacher can't go past what this word
[1:11:26] says
[1:11:28] so it says you must go to church you
[1:11:30] must read your bible you must study you
[1:11:33] must listen to a five-fold ministry amen
[1:11:39] listen i know people can't get here
[1:11:41] because of certain um you know health
[1:11:43] issues and and distances and all that
[1:11:46] but
[1:11:47] um
[1:11:49] my brother was telling me the other day
[1:11:50] he said
[1:11:51] there was a group of people that were
[1:11:52] streaming him
[1:11:55] for maybe a year or so
[1:11:57] and one couple decided to move
[1:12:01] to the church
[1:12:02] that was a good thing
[1:12:04] but the problem was
[1:12:06] the brother said when the sister and the
[1:12:08] brother walked in it looked like she was
[1:12:09] getting ready to wash clothes and he was
[1:12:10] getting ready to go the garden
[1:12:15] what what does that mean bro
[1:12:18] they hadn't been to church in three
[1:12:19] years they didn't know how to dress
[1:12:22] they dressed the way they watched it
[1:12:24] online
[1:12:27] about that who it was
[1:12:29] the brother said
[1:12:32] y'all don't need you in church now you
[1:12:34] need to dress like you're in church now
[1:12:36] get the slippers off
[1:12:38] put you on some good clothes
[1:12:40] and come to church
[1:12:43] that was the problem they'd sat around
[1:12:45] drank their coffee and tea and their you
[1:12:47] know sister didn't do her hair and she
[1:12:49] wore or gown and whatever and you know
[1:12:52] even when brother dale was
[1:12:55] sick and streaming and couldn't
[1:12:58] come here
[1:12:59] he had his good clothes on
[1:13:02] sitting in front of that watching i
[1:13:04] think we ought to all do that
[1:13:06] we all not all be in our pajamas we
[1:13:08] already at least if we can't make it to
[1:13:09] church you ought to feel like you're in
[1:13:11] church
[1:13:11] amen
[1:13:13] just a little bit of
[1:13:15] a little bit of wisdom there
[1:13:17] those who were filled with the holy
[1:13:19] ghost heard the word
[1:13:21] received it some of you are turning it
[1:13:23] down
[1:13:24] because you're acting like it
[1:13:27] and lived by it
[1:13:30] those who did not have the spirit heard
[1:13:33] it only as carnal men oh that's just
[1:13:35] brother wade oh that's just brother dale
[1:13:36] that's just bro louise that's just
[1:13:37] brother aaron that's your brother bob
[1:13:40] you better be careful
[1:13:44] those who did not have the spirit heard
[1:13:46] it only as carnal men put a wrong
[1:13:48] interpretation on it and went into sin
[1:13:53] in every age every age of the holy ghost
[1:13:55] for the true believer i say in every age
[1:13:57] the evidence was the same
[1:13:59] those who had the spirit the teacher
[1:14:02] heard the word and that spirit in them
[1:14:06] took the word and taught it or revealed
[1:14:09] it to them and they were of the group
[1:14:11] that heard the messenger
[1:14:13] and his message
[1:14:15] and took it and lived it
[1:14:19] amen wow
[1:14:22] just a few more minutes and then we'll
[1:14:23] stop right here this is where we'll
[1:14:24] probably
[1:14:25] start this afternoon
[1:14:26] matthew 11 verse 12 says from the days
[1:14:28] of john the baptist until now the
[1:14:30] kingdom of heaven suffers violence
[1:14:32] and the violence take it by force the
[1:14:34] violet take it by force the kingdom of
[1:14:36] god is taken by force you gotta listen
[1:14:38] it's gonna it's really easy to sit at
[1:14:40] home and and cut the cut the thing on
[1:14:43] and watch it
[1:14:46] it's an effort to get here
[1:14:49] i admire a lot of you that drive sister
[1:14:52] trudy used to drive four
[1:14:55] hours one
[1:14:57] way
[1:14:59] to hear the word of god
[1:15:01] and you know what sister trudy
[1:15:03] how many times do you break down during
[1:15:05] that whole 20-something year 20 years
[1:15:08] not one time she had a volvo that had
[1:15:11] what
[1:15:12] three three hundred thousand miles
[1:15:14] it has to be miles getting count them
[1:15:17] but you know what god honored that faith
[1:15:21] and you know one thing's for sure i want
[1:15:23] yeah
[1:15:26] i'm gonna give you a rose while you're
[1:15:27] here
[1:15:28] [Applause]
[1:15:29] she was never late
[1:15:33] oh that ought to burn some of y'all up
[1:15:37] four hours
[1:15:40] that meant she had to leave at five
[1:15:42] o'clock in the morning
[1:15:45] to get here by nine
[1:15:47] not 9 30.
[1:15:50] she's always here at least almost an
[1:15:52] hour early
[1:15:54] four
[1:15:55] hours
[1:15:58] and when she left that's why we have
[1:15:59] services at two at two o'clock in the
[1:16:01] afternoon mainly so sister trudy can get
[1:16:03] home when it's because it's not so late
[1:16:06] because if she leaves here at four
[1:16:07] o'clock now she lives closer now but
[1:16:09] then she didn't she drove years and her
[1:16:11] husband didn't come with a show by
[1:16:12] herself
[1:16:13] well i gotta have my husband with me
[1:16:16] you don't have him all the time will you
[1:16:18] sometimes you tell him to go do
[1:16:20] something else
[1:16:21] but she didn't have her husband with her
[1:16:24] and she still got in the car
[1:16:26] and you know what at four o'clock i
[1:16:27] always thought about this at four

[1:26:46] the blessings of god oh brother you
[1:26:48] don't understand i'm just struggling are
[1:26:50] you doing everything that god told you
[1:26:52] to do
[1:26:54] you the only one that knows that
[1:26:57] you're the only one that can say yes or
[1:26:59] no if you say no then whose fault is it
[1:27:01] god's no it's your fault let's start
[1:27:04] owning up to what we do
[1:27:07] and not like brother louise was talking
[1:27:09] about well
[1:27:10] brother so-and-so is gossiping i think
[1:27:12] i'll just gossip on him you know
[1:27:14] what about you know what the world says
[1:27:16] tit for tat you know you do this to me
[1:27:17] and we'll do this to you
[1:27:18] that's not christian
[1:27:22] if jesus would have done that he'd have
[1:27:24] just destroyed the world
[1:27:26] right
[1:27:27] you hit me i'll hit you
[1:27:30] you hang me on the cross i'll put you on
[1:27:31] a cross
[1:27:32] you put me in a tomb i'll put you in a
[1:27:34] tomb no
[1:27:35] he said father forgive them for they
[1:27:37] know not what they're doing
[1:27:39] come out of that grave and he said all
[1:27:40] power and heavenly earth has been given
[1:27:42] unto me and i'm fixing to give it to a
[1:27:44] bride
[1:27:45] on the day of pentecost i'm going to
[1:27:46] come in 120 and we're going to destroy
[1:27:49] this devil oh it don't look like it
[1:27:51] but he did it
[1:27:53] you know when you are hit over in a
[1:27:56] sixth dimension satan has never put his
[1:27:58] grubby feet in that dimension
[1:28:01] never has he been in that sixth
[1:28:03] dimension because that's only for the
[1:28:05] believers
[1:28:07] just like i said about the future home
[1:28:08] he he might be in he'll be around in the
[1:28:11] millennium he'll be able to come back to
[1:28:12] the earth and do some awful things
[1:28:15] but when that new city comes down out of
[1:28:17] heaven
[1:28:18] he'll never
[1:28:20] ever
[1:28:21] ever
[1:28:23] touch that city
[1:28:24] he'll never touch that ground that's
[1:28:26] been walked on but you and i will for an
[1:28:28] eternity let's sing one more
[1:28:31] [Music]

[1:29:05] with and
[1:29:08] i've just been really impressed
[1:29:10] um

[1:30:04] a brother you know what i said or you
[1:30:06] don't know how to say it but i said
[1:30:07] something about a brother up in
[1:30:08] tennessee
[1:30:09] and that burdened me and kept burdening
[1:30:11] me and you know what it's like brother
[1:30:12] dale said if he keeps burning you long
[1:30:14] enough you go oh really that wasn't
[1:30:16] important
[1:30:17] no it's always gonna stay there
[1:30:21] what hurts you worse a great big thorn
[1:30:22] that you can pull out notice that little
[1:30:24] stinker that breaks off on the end of
[1:30:26] that and you get it and it keeps
[1:30:28] festering it keeps fast and you can't
[1:30:29] dig it out
[1:30:30] well that's what it was it was digging
[1:30:32] at me
[1:30:33] to get that right and when i got it
[1:30:35] right guess what i had him i had a what
[1:30:38] a justification again i had an emptying
[1:30:40] out
