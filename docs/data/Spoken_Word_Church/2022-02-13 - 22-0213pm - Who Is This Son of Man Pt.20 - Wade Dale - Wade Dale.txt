show up we're coming we'll have something candles on that thing and cause a fire downstairs so we'll we'll just get the eight and the two and that'll help with the fire code so just remember that i want to read you something real quick before we before we start this this is in a resume of the church ages i was just thinking about some things that i said this morning brother brown tells us he says he's talking about denominations protestants nicoletism humanizing the leadership of the church and disposing deposing the spirit he says you see they are ignorant but if the rapture should take place at this moment ignorance would be no court of appeal listen ignorance would be no court of appeal from the judgment of god for being in the wrong ranks one more time you see they are ignorant but if the rapture should take place at this moment now that's 1960-something one or two ignorance would be no court of appeal from the judgment of god for being in the wrong ranks you believe brother brown was a prophet okay then you got to believe what he said all right so let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you for this day that you give us we pray now that you would help us in this journey lord we know one thing's for sure that the battle is going to get harder but the victory's also sweeter victory is mine through jesus christ and no one else we're not preaching that we're going to be so great lord you know we're trying to get the people to see how great you are and how great you are that you've decided to live in a group of people called your bride and that you are going to manifest yourself just like you did 2 000 years ago walking on the earth in just one man you're gonna do it in thousands of bride around the world and lord we're looking for that time we appreciate you sending us a prophet lord without him we couldn't say these things and lord at this quote here lord it just rings in my heart that that if we need to get on the bus we need to be at the bus station we need to be there and ready to go father i pray that you would help us to do that lord i believe you have given us a roadmap i believe you have give us a gps god's predestinated seed lord i believe you give us that they'll take us if we'll just let it out and let it work father we pray that you'll be with us furthermore service bless us in jesus name amen you know i read a book one time and i cannot remember the name of it i think i still have it in my in my little library over there or something maybe dave ramsey gave to me but it was a book that a man wrote he said you know he said anything you do is kind of like a bus you can be on the right bus you can be going in the right direction you can have the motor running but the wrong person in the driver's seat and the wrong position of the people in the bus right people right bus motor running right direction but you're not in your position that's what we're going to talk about today being in in position amen you get on the bus you've got people that sit in the front you've got people sitting the back you got people that are tour guides you got people that are there that are that different ones if you have the tour guide which may be blind driving the bus disaster but if you put everybody in the right place that's why i read that about the wrong ranks being in the wrong race at the time of the rapture is no excuse and man brother dale's quoted that a thousand times and i tried to look it up the way i just quoted it and it ain't quoted that way it's quoted like this right here but it's the same thing paraphrasing being at the wrong being in the wrong ranks of the rapture is no excuse but there's no court of appeal brother ram said if you're in the wrong ranks at the time of the rapture man so let's just pray that we'll get to that i i don't i don't listen i don't discount anybody if you want to discount yourself that's fine but i don't discount anybody i think we're all going to make it i think we've all got a position to fulfill too right and then when the bride realizes who she is and what's she doing here she being invincible army i believe we're getting to that place to understanding who we are and what we're doing here and man let's go to john 1 1-14 in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god come on levi levi something wrong with it uh oh malfunction we have become malfunction junction here the past couple of weeks you all need to pray for this internet thing we good oh you gotta turn the thing on okay all right well we can and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seen in the lord as blessing to the reason of the word and we were talking this morning therefore when he cometh into the world sacrifice and offering that what is not but a body has thou prepared me and look this body has to be brother brown tells us many times that that we can be that we can have the word that was talking about the bus we can have the word and we can dislocate it we can mis we can misplace it but it be the word because listen truly the denominations are the or the world that preaches a father son holy ghost baptism is true jesus said and that's the way we baptize we baptize according to jesus telling the disciples you'll hear us when we baptize people in accordance with jesus telling the apostles to go into all the world preach the gospel baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost i now baptize you my brother or sister in the name of the lord jesus christ because we're doing exactly what god told us to do we know what the father is we know what the son is we know what the holy ghost is it's the lord jesus christ but to fulfill that scripture he did listen the problem with us is message believers sometimes when we see a false doctrine or we see um the denominations preach that and take that father-son holy ghost baptism we say oh well that's there's something wrong with that scripture it's just not right no it's exactly what he said please let's don't dis dislocate that scripture well the denominations take this scripture but we take this one no you can't fight scripture with scripture they either both right or both wrong all right so that's the same way with what we see now the body now has prepared me go to hebrews 10. but a body has now prepared me now you've got to decide whether you're in the body but god is going to build a body he's going to have a bride on the earth in the end time that's not going to be at the wrong ranks they're going to know who they are and what they're doing here all right now that's a promise everybody believe brother brown was a prophet okay all right then we got to understand what he's saying let's go to ephesians 5 verse 23 for the husband is the head of the wife and i'm going to try to fly through this because we went through it this morning for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body now remember there was a bridegroom listen to me just a minute there was a bridegroom that came to the old testament hello to marry his first bride israel amen you've seen many scriptures in the old testament of the voice of the bride and the voice of the bridegroom is not heard in her anymore why it's left there's only one bride and this is the end time people who we are that's alive now there's pride down through the church ages we know that but this group of people is supposed to hear from the bridegroom and then make him manifest because we it took a prophet to tell us that the scriptures that spoke of the bride groom also speaks to the bride so whatever the bridegroom gives we're heirs and joiners with christ it took a prophet to tell us that amen and the prophet told us that he said look husbands you're the head of your wife even as christ is the head of the church now how did that happen how did it happen before the fall they were co-equal before the fall eve's headship was christ or the father whoever you want to say the one who came down to cool today and talked to both of them equally he didn't have any secrets for the for the adam and no the one that had the secret was the serpent and he got involved in between them and that's what caused the problem but remember they were co-equal that's why paul could tell us in romans that we're heirs and joint heirs with christ in other words he has restored us back to full fellowship bride and bridegroom won but now since what happened with the fall the husband has to be the head of the wife as christ is the head of the church man let's don't drag our wives around by the hair with a club on their back and drag them into the into the cave unless you want god to grab you by the hair and drag you into the cave amen but that's the order that we got to go in i want you to listen this because we're going to go all the way to the very end and i want you to look at something here i think i brought it [Music] yes all right so the husband is head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of this body that he is building all right everybody got that all right so let's go now to colossians 1 18. for he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead and all things he might have the preeminence and i read you what that brother russ was talking about this morning do we give him preeminence listen it's nothing there's nothing wrong with going on vacation there's nothing wrong with making money there's nothing wrong with having a nice house but if you put that before god and if you say that is my success is because you understand what i'm saying listen there's a lot of dirt filthy people filthy rich people in this world that are horrible why they say filthy rich why they say filthy rich but there is this going to hell and if they don't give their life to god they're going to bust they'll wide open and have billions and billions of dollars why they didn't put god first but then you got somebody that i believe like stewart kathy the chick-fil-a founder we ain't working on sunday we're gonna do more business on monday through thursday on monday through saturday that mcdonald's does 24 hours a day seven days a week and they passed that just a few years ago in six days they do and have you ever been listening me and jim grew up working for mcdonald's but you look at the people that hire chick-fil-a and you look at the people they hire at mcdonald's those chick-fil-a people are nice you have a good experience when you go there i don't care if the listen the drive-through at mcdonald's if it's if it's y'all quit lifting the drive through at mcdonald's would can be lined out into the street and they'd be cussing and fussing chick-fil-a the lines will be wrapped around the building and out into the street and they're like just as happy as they can be and you know what that makes you happy yeah what are you saying brother wait listen stewart cassidy put god first now he might have not been a message believer come on people good grief there's going to be more people in heaven that don't believe this message than our there's only a small group of people that knows that god sent a prophet in the end time small group compared to seven billion people in the world let's go turn them out let's bring them in let's be salty because you know what i like to go to chick-fil-a now the reason we don't all the time jun don't like their french fries but i do so i bow to her every once in a while we go somewhere else but i need chick-fil-a all the time why it's a good experience good food good experience and i'm not i'm not just when i get get finished and look at one of my mcdonald's five minutes in the drive-through and haven't got your order yet it makes you a little bit upset oh oh temperance temperance and you white brother kindness out you got to have tempers first i'm just saying you oughta we ought to be able to even in our life to look and see who has who has lived a godly life and how that that their their uh economy their children all different ones i mean we got you know we got some of this but you take most people that try their best to live a christian life and god will bless them remember tithing is not just for the bride and to pour out the windows of heaven is not just for the bride the poor out of the windows of heaven is for everybody now you may not go to heaven but you sure will be blessed if you're not born again you're not going to heaven i don't care if you pay 90 but see the right ranks the right order if you go the right order everything will work out i promise you you can tell when people don't pay tithes it don't take brother branham to be here to be a prophet to discern who pays tithes who don't so don't think you're hiding anything and i listen i don't look at the title book it ain't none of my business really ain't nobody's business just saying but he's the head of the body of the church who's the beginning the firstborn from the dead and then all things he might have the premise that's where we got to him preeminence but if we don't see though if we give him the preeminence what are we doing with it after that turn it over to god and then take it back away from him how many times have you turned your children over to god come on people raise your hand everybody every every parent in this room raise your hand you give them over to god and then you took them back [Music] that's just human brother brown said turn them over to god and let them go let them go regardless i told my you know my kids are not here today but i said god save their soul i don't care if they're laying dead almost dead in the street give them time to repent give them time to repent because you know what i want to see them for an eternity if you don't have a desire to see your kids for 15 minutes while we're on this side i don't know why i'm doing this but but really if your kids ignore i mean never mind anyway what's going to happen over yonder come on now really same way with me y'all gotta have some somehow in this world y'all gotta learn to love me [Applause] you gotta find a way because i got i know you do i'm just kidding we got we all got the holy ghost and we all have our little quirks like we talked about this morning but but but you want me to read that thing i got my billfold again oh let me read oh nobody these brother brother brother um potato over there favorite quote listen you hear me you take this back to idaho but you need to come back here we love you man you did a good job that this morning was heartfelt that was good some people will never like you because your spirit irritates their demons let me read that one more time some people will never like you because your spirit irritates their demons [Music] i'm glad we're family but we do have family arguments every once in a while so it's okay but he's the head of the body of the church but listen we got to have headship we've got to have somebody to lead us that's what god said it's not something i did it's something god did god said you've got to have apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists oh sister lily you weren't in when i read that let me read that again go ahead you've heard it before about irritating my irritating demons i'm glad we got some said yeah yeah this police say yes they all said please say yes let's get on with this but he's the head of the body of the church who's the beginning the firstborn from the dead then in all things he might have the preeminence let's go to romans 8 verse 14 we're going to enter into that we'll probably do this next sunday or sunday afternoon let's talk about romans because as brother bob's preaching on three stages of of of grace there's three stages of adoption brother that was preached on it many many times but we've got some newer ones in here and we we want to bring it out again there's definitely according to romans if you'll read romans 8 read the whole chapter that just really gives you the whole walk of a christian even if the spirit of him that that raised up jesus from the dead dwelling in you he'll also quicken your mortal body hold on a minute your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you so let's wrote romans 8 14 for as many are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god now that's your born-again experience that starts in verse 14 and it continues on we'll not read all of it for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again listen you're in bondage as we were talking about this morning you're in bondage by the law the law will bind you grace will set you free and man grace will set you free that's why the headstone comes in jerubal is crying what not just grace grace grace unto it double grace is what we're going to have to have to get out of here for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry daddy daddy and that's the way you get started in your journey you become a christian if you ever remember you ought to remember you ought to just let that run through your mind maybe it'll keep you awake run through your mind of how you got started and how when i remember when i was a christian a young christian there in 99 and received the holy ghost there in kentucky come back here and then started opening services like terence does and i started doing bible study or sun school class and then god called me to preach but i can see myself going through that that i needed something but you know i just asked and god gave it to me first six eight months maybe a year i'd ask things and he just silver platter why because i was a baby i needed child training though but at that moment you don't spank a child when they're three months old if they don't know what they're doing wrong they're not going to process but as they get older yeah and that nerve in that rear end goes all the way to the brain some of them not so much but that's what god did for me i don't know if he did that for you but but now but now where are you lord then the last three things i asked i ain't got no email no text nothing hey man why grow up baby grow up baby i don't have to go crying to mom and dad say oh oh my dad i'm having a rough time i'm having a rough time you know what they tell me go back home you chose this road you live it that's the way god is folks for us to see what god does to us is to see what you're doing in your life and you know more than anybody else how you and god deal with each other hello you know because you either take the devil with you all the time or you take god with you all the time and you know that now there is times where you do it's like brother dale said how many times do you question your new birth he said every morning you do because you say mine why did i do that but there's guys come a time where you put that state down and say uh we're not going back no more we're going forward we're gonna hey we're on the right bus we're going in the right direction we may not know which seat is ours not yet but that's okay at least we got the bus into going in the right direction and we know we're on the right bus the right place amen but not in the wrong ranks no excuse the prophet said but we receive the spirit of adoption listen when you get born again you receive the spirit of adoption every one of you do whether you want to make it or not you know whether you want to go up a statute of perfect man if you're born again today you're a child of god just like brother brown was a child of god you got to decide how far you want to grow up amen because you know what we baby feed people babies until when it'd be real strange if we go downstairs between services and sarah's having to feed levi's mouth you know looks like he's doing a pretty good job doing himself but it wouldn't not be strange though to walk into a room and here's a 15 year 16 year old kid and his mama's spoon feeding him and he's going [Music] listen what would you think it would be something mental well see i think it's something spiritual that's the way god will see something spiritual if he's still gotta spoon feed you what do like we used to do here comes the bus open up here comes the bus now god will do that for a while because he's a good god but you know at one time point in time he told moses he said look buddy grow up grow up why cry moses speak and go forward that's what god's want he's never listened to me he's never had a bride on the earth since he came himself he's never had a bride that could speak the word like this group of people gonna be able to speak the word cannot will not because you and i i've got a quote in there i'll bring it next time where brother brown said tell me my brother my sister when has god filled the church as he's going to feel in the end time he said just for a moment just for a moment the world's going to see another jesus christ on the earth not just of not just as speaking but in action what the bible tell us when we get in trouble what do we do now when we get in trouble well i know what your kids do you start lying just kidding just kidding i'm lying but the bible tells us that if you're sent before what if you're sent before governments figures he said don't even think what you're going to say now what's the third first thing we do we start trying to figure that out hello we gonna we start going wait a minute what angle can i take to to to make that cop just give me a warning ticket oh i tell him i i gotta get my mother sitting in the hot you guys start lying most of the time if you're just telling the truth look i wasn't looking at the speedometer sometimes they'll give you that but anyway with god it's the same way we try to get out of stuff just admit it god i'm a sinner i'm lost i'm talking about people that's not born again just admit it even people has been in a message 30 years we've ought to sit down one saying look god what's wrong with me and he's going to say you're what's wrong with you i'm not what's wrong with you you can't blame god for stuff you do right we okay can i preach a little bit this afternoon but he's creating himself a body so he's always had the right bus he knew what he was going to have he was going to have seven church ages with seven stars and seven spirits real simple but the one in the end time is the one that's gonna have to be able to drive the bus to where it's going on its destination and see you can have all that look you can have all the 50 people at 50 people supposed to ride the bus and one guy's supposed to drive it what's the driver don't show up or what if the driver he says i think i'll ride this i'll ride the bus today the bus ain't going nowhere he's the driver and he's on the bus the motor's running but he says no i'm not the driver i'm this over here wrong ranks but somebody's gotta get an in drive that bus and i'm talking about your bus i'm talking about you driving your bus with your family and your kids and all the things that you do all your job and everything you the one that's got to take control folks it's got to be but it's not somebody like moses to rise up to take us over because moses didn't take us over moses died the prophet of the end time passed away but he showed us the promised land he showed us where to go and then he sent not not the third in line or or the the pot washer or the gravedigger joshua was his warrior standing right there beside him and god spoke to joshua the same as he spoke to moses as i was with moses so i want to tell you today just as god was with william branham except in the prophetic him being a seventh messenger but i thought under the seventh messenger we were the voice of the final voice of the final age so he has instilled in us joshua you're going to take them over we were talking about this today i've been reading a little book and it's not it's not a message book not a message believer either but he does a real good job to show how everybody was placed in the land but do you know some of their land was so big you know what god told them though he said when you get in this land you drive every ite out of that land kill them all drive them out that's your property you know what happened they got lazy they got lazy and some of their properties was so big until they didn't drive everybody out they just said oh they're up there in the north part of ghad we're just going to leave them alone and you know what that was their downfall every one of them all them ites standing out of churchite not reading your bible light looking at the wrong website and all them otherites amen that's what's wrong with me i don't know about y'all i'm preaching to me today okay y'all can just take it if you need to if you don't if you've already passed all that you sleep but this is for us people we got to see who we are yeah and what we're doing here and who's our leader who was the lead josh sure joshua but joshua type to what the holy ghost the holy ghost placed you we'll talk about that in a little while is placing that's what we got to come to we got to come to placing right bus right people right driver right mechanic everything's got to be exactly right because it hasn't been right in the church ages i read you that quote where the prophet of god said they had just enough to get them saved just enough to get them on the bus just enough to get them on the bus but they didn't go anywhere they didn't know where to go so an adversary gets on the bus and says i'm the driver and t takes them to down a false doctrine gets on a baptist bust or a pentecostal buzzer what a brand of might bus whatever you want to say i like what brother brown said in the rest of this quote i didn't read it he said it's not the people he said it's the system now listen can we be in a system i read you a quote the other day where brother brown says i don't know that we're getting them to christ he said i think we're getting them to an idea or theology or terminology our terminology is different than the world because we don't believe in three gods we don't believe in water baptisms in the name of fathers on holy ghost why our terminology is different but if that's just something you do as a ritual it'll do you no good that's what'll kill you that's why paul said the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life the letter of the law is what killed israel but the grace of god got israel into the promised land it was grace all the way through even when adam and eve did what they did it started grace right there actually grace started before the foundation of the world god slade himself remember slave lamb slain before the foundation of the world everybody all right but now we've got to come to this we talk about new creation and we'll try to jump through all that new creation a new race you and i are the aliens that that the earth has been looking for you ever thought about that we're supposed to be aliens right you know what the bible says we're supposed to be aliens we're not supposed to be like the world you see all these people how this superhuman race comes to earth becomes superman batman spiderman all these other people women too wonder woman all that stuff this is a superhero sitting here and it's not a comic book and it's not something you got to put on except christ a uniform won't save you captain america right they all had a flaw though remember but man has took that idea and said oh there's a superhuman race hitler wasn't far off but look what he'd done he killed 6.8 million human beings men women and children just because they were jews no other reason he wasn't mad at one guy because he was this no he was mad at the whole race you know why because they had his money but the mentality was i'm going to get rid of this race and make me a new one well the quote here says new creation new race how far off was he if he had to listen to god not listen to the devil he could have been a good preacher what brother branham say he wanted to talk to albert einstein see we had a spiritual einstein on the earth at the same time natural einstein was on the earth because you know by physics and by by even by mathematics he proved he einstein proved that if you could see an infinity you'd see the back of your head and that's the truth because what light travels in a circle light doesn't travel straight light travels in a circle so when you go so far to infinity and come back you see the back part of your head he proved that by what mathematics brother brown proved it by spiritual mathematics he put the word together he put this word together so me and you would have have a less hard time seeing what's going on like i said before if this message is hard you don't have the holy ghost oh i'm sorry i mean if you say i cannot understand this how can god give you something and then not let you to understand not let you have a something to understand it by there's a lot of things you can say look i don't understand that but you should never say i don't believe that that's the difference maybe i'm giving you some life lessons today you're staying awake a little bit more maybe it's okay we'll talk about life lessons more often husbands love your wife for you've not received the spirit of bondage again to fear that's what that's what the world what is what's going on in the world today everybody's scared of everything more than ever before you do that and about 20 people just fall and they go to doing this putting that sanitizer up man we used to play outside as kids kids were there old as me we used to play outside and my mama and daddy have to they're sitting right there they'd have to find us find us in the woods mom would scream supper if we wouldn't if we were already a mile or two out in the woods we didn't hear but you know what we come home we come home with tater patches around our neck anybody know oh sorry not an idaho tater patch i love you man but we did everybody who knows what a potato tater patch is donny huh me it's that real brown streak that runs around it what happens is all your sweat why i'm doing this i don't know all this sweat and dirt collects right here and you get a tater patch where you can grow taters around your neck if you were to plant them now today we sanitize everything we sanitize our kids we sanitize everything we never call it disease by having a tater patch what am i saying same thing with the gospel have we overstepped the simplicity of the gospel and thinks this is what we need to do we need to sanitize everybody you need to you know sneeze into your arms when they sent that out the other day well when it first got started they sent us a big you know we're federal i'm a federal employee so they send it to us first sneeze into your elbow i want y'all to try that no that ain't your elbow sister that's your elbow that's not your elbow that's your arm that's your elbow sneeze into your elbow that's why i think the the virus kept going people didn't sneeze in their elbow but that was instructions but how insane is that and how insane is it that us we want to be so protective and i know most of you in this room has had the virus before some bad case some not so bad case but come on how do these people that stay home never go out and they get the virus you snuck out went to walmart one day didn't you guarantee you huh think about it oh i'm not going to church because i might get or give but i got to go to walmart just saying the little things that we do or don't do affects all that and for god to be effective it's for us to listen to him now we said many times before you know the virus thing is some it's all a lot of it's political a lot of it's you know my stand on it i took one of the shots and i've been crazy ever since my body has my body not my brain but some of you didn't some of you didn't and that's okay you do whatever you want to do but what i'm saying is is when are we gonna just quit crying we're gonna quit crying say god i've had enough of this i'm going to church because remember what i just read you a couple a couple of days ago that the more you stay out of the church the more you don't want to go that's that's what it is it's the repetition that you get in that god wants you to get into that reputation repetition of going to church and then if you cut that repetition out look some people disappear and you never see him again just saying but we have an adversary folks that he's very very smart he's very very smart he actually is going to take this whole world and deceive him one man is going to deceive the whole world except the bride and when we leave he's got a hundred percent he's going to take a hundred percent of the people and persecute him all at the same time but he's here now he's trying to get me and you but we must believe that this whole body this body of believers there's a work for each one of you to do i want you to get into your place learn that position and stay in it husbands love your wives and we'll go through all that as he loves the church because we are his wife we're his bride and you are coming to a place let's skip all over all that i know second peter 1 verse 3 we'll talk about the the virtues we're going to get back and talk about the virtues but let's go um all the way to where we were at this morning to galatians 3 18 which uh brother levi you're gonna have to scroll through it's hot up here what's it on over there lyre that thing's lying it's about 80 up here i got sweat and i'm not even trying all right let's go to galatians 3 8 team it is hot up here though sure enough so now listen we all as human beings we talk about inheritance jim just got an inheritance if you mom or dad passes away you get an inheritance but remember it has to be the death of a testator before you can can get this all right they don't read the will while the man or woman is alive you got to be passed on that's why when jesus christ took took that cup and he said this is a cup in the new testament in my blood because that testator had to die to create a new testament because the old testament was by the law the inheritance of the law it is no more promise there wasn't a promise in the old testament read hebrews 11 where it says day without us will not be made perfect but read the scripture before that not having the promise great men david it names them all abraham um moses noah all these great men are able it says not having the promise what is the promise god listen when god said in genesis 3 15 he started in genesis 1 and said i'll make man in my own image well that got marred as the prophet said there's no way that could be birthed but god said in genesis 3 15 he said i'll put it back together i'll put enmity or division between you and me but i'm going to come back as human being and i'm going to put it right back together again under a new testament because the old testament only puts you what condemned you but god gave it to abraham by promise in other words when you start in genesis 12 or 13 he says i will i will abraham i will i will give you this i will do that i am i am i am well wherefore then serve at the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed could come to whom the promise was made us us and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator who's our mediator jesus christ but he wasn't that mediator in the old testament hello it was the father above them looking down through the blood it was the only reason they didn't die it's because there was a substitute there bulls and goats but when christ came let's go on all the way up scroll down now a mediator is not a mediator of one but god levi you're not driving a car okay there you go listen i appreciate these brothers doing that i'm playing with them but they know i appreciate them i appreciate brother joe and brother anderson and them training them so that they don't have to be in there the whole time they can come out here and sit and enjoy the service y'all don't understand what goes on back there in that room it takes up a lot of their time a lot of their mental time especially if something goes wrong and and 15 people start calling on the phone you don't hear it but they hear it back there they get hey man that's out i can't see nothing i can't hear nothing but thank god they're they're training a lot of people in this room to be back there and to do the work so that some of our brothers can rotate and sit out here and and enjoy the service now mediator is not immediate everyone but god is one is the law then against the promise of god so now look it's the law against god no the law was given because of transgression the bible tells us that jesus came under the law and not he couldn't do away with the old testament but he made it where we could live it he gave us grace to where we can live the ten commandments to what we can understand what isaiah was saying what uh joshua and all these different ones were talking about is the law then against the promise of god god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life barely righteousness would have been by the law in other words if there would have been a mediator come in the old testament and give his life instead of giving animal life we wouldn't have needed it righteousness would have been by the law but you can't get righteousness out of the law but the scripture have concluded i like paul's writings all understand he just threw it out there all of you and then if he left it right there we're all in trouble but he didn't watch that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe thank god that's me and you that's right now that's today but before faith came we were kept under the law listen when you were born you were born under the law because jesus didn't come to bring us a new way to get born by sex that's plain but he didn't you must be born again and poor nicodemus bless his heart if i got to go back and get in my mama's womb have i gotta go back get in my mama's womb carnal jesus said you can't understand because this is coming from above but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed that's why brother brown many many times he said faith is a revelation your new birth is what a revelation a personal revelation between you and jesus christ not between you and so and so in jesus christ no you and jesus christ there is no mediator as the catholic church see they insert mediators men human men that come in and and women sometimes if you're a saint they throw them in between that you've got to mediate to them and they mediate to this one and this mediates the god no there's one mediator the man christ jesus wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to christ there's your schoolmaster that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come in other words after you're born again you're not under school master bible what did the school master do told you you were lost but before faith came here's faith here's your new birth before faith your common life was what under the law shut up in faith which shall be after be revealed wherefore the law with our schoolmaster to bring us to christ to this point right here that we might be justified by faith but after faith has come we don't need the schoolmaster it listen you say oh now what do away with the schoolmaster no the schoolmaster what he's told you is now inside of you it's imprinted in you and if you're born again you can't have that taken away from you so it doesn't that the school master we have to do away with it paul when he says leaving the principles of doctrine of christ the baptism he don't mean to leave it not ever do it again he means that should be already in you so much it should be part of your dna christian dna amen that you don't have to fight over that anymore the schoolmaster brought you to a place to where you don't fight over these old things anymore now you got to fight still so that's why it gives you a tutor and a governor as you continue on with your schooling wherefore the law was our school master to bring us to christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come we are no longer under a schoolmaster for you are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus in other words when we read romans 8 we'll come back to this romans 8 said you received the spirit of adoption spirit of adoption in the line of adoption because listen folks the prodigal son was the son you all understand that the prodigal son was a son he didn't become a son when he came back now in the mind of god you always were that's where the people get all this mixed up in the mind of god you always were that son remember brother brown said you're not become sons by the birth but that's in god's mind folks i know i was lost i know i didn't have god nowhere in my life because he will not live an unclean vessel he won't even touch uncleanness but when faith came when the real mind of god come to you and said i want to birth you if you'll just believe me take me at my word then it will change you change your min change your thinking for we are all the children of god by faith in jesus christ whereas many of you that have been baptized into cross have put on christ there's neither jew nor greek there's neither bond or free there's neither male or female why we're all one in christ heirs and join us if you beat christ then you are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise now let's go down to the next which is this is a continuation now i say that the heir as long as he's a child difference nothing from a servant though he be lord of all like i said before now look at that position boy the son the son as soon as he gets about 16 years old or whatever he says you gotta listen to me you gotta listen to me because i'm the son that ain't the right attitude if it didn't humble you when god saved you you didn't get saved if that you let me say that again if you didn't get humble and thank god for what he did for you and that he didn't destroy you in your previous life that ought to humble you not make you proud now i say that there as long as he's a child different nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but he's under tutors and governors now here we go he's under tutors and governors now we got a little bit higher we're fixing to go to college now we got out of high school but under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father what time was that now now until that's when we needed it see that in the in the six church ages i say seven church ages i wasn't going to say that but even in seven church ages that's not the time appointed to the father for people to come to adoption everybody received the spirit of adoption crying father father everybody did but only one is going to be what placed that's what we're going to get to in just a minute placed that's the whole deal you got to be placed right bus right direction place yourself in the right seat even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law look to redeem them that were under the law redeem bring back that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying of a father or father father wherefore they are no more a servant but a son and if a son than an heir of god through christ as i said many times before never make yourself special god will do that for you god will make you special i've heard listen we've been in the message long enough i've seen people come by and they're like i wear this special we see like i said we have this special seating us when we're born well now you can call quote brother brown hey there's a verbatim quote but what's he talking about i've always tell him i'll tell you one more time god's a just god judgment is passed on sons and daughters too but it's not the great judgment everybody got that but everybody is equal when they're born or gods of respect they're persons so if adolf hitler walks up to the white throne he's going to look up and say well if you put something different in them than you put in me you can't judge me [Music] but god's going to say no you got it all wrong i came to you in 1939 so dave whatever it is he'll tell him exactly i tried to get you saved i tried to get you to believe in me and you wouldn't do it he said these people behind me i'll tell you what day they got saved that's the mind of god folks that's the mind of god not what's going on down here on the earth in the mind of god listen in the mind of god this thing's finished in the mind of god you didn't you didn't have a regular life [Music] brother brown said if god saw your sin he'd have to destroy you didn't know what he said if he would have saw adam and eve sin he would have had to kill them both we always talk about him throwing evil way he'd have thrown out him away too but remember there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world that was grace that was a covering for them were heirs of god through christ all right let's go to the next i want to read these quotes to you and then we're finished [Music] and i was going to read these quotes anyway this is not coming from anything that i said before but listen when i read these i want you to think about something we're talking about placing we're talking about a position i'm not calling no names no churches okay everybody understand what i'm saying i'm just going to tell you what brother brown said we needed i remember staying a year and six months in this book of revelations in the tabernacle this is on the seven church ages 1954 this is before he preached him in 60. that's what i like in teaching i just love teaching oh my i think it's wonderful it gives the basis and settles the church now who in the world wouldn't want to be a settled a settled church in preaching now there are some people that are preachers they can pick up the word with inspiration levi help me please thank you they can pick up the word with inspiration watch and sway it out there in places that's watering the seed that the teacher has taught i'm re yep i believe brother brown was a prophet okay then we're going to believe what he said that's watering the seed that the teacher has taught see now you've got to put some seed in first then water it and the watering comes from the preaching of the word there's a great vast difference between a teacher and a preacher see it's two different gifts of the spirit all together two different gifts and i humbly say this but i haven't a gift of either that's humble that's a prophet of god standing saying he doesn't even have both no he had all of them but how humble was he all right let's go to adoption listen just a few more we'll be finished adoption 1960. bible teaching is a little usually a little treacherous although you know kind of walking on thin ice we call it but we just feel that maybe at this point and this time it might be good kind of to bring the church to what i think is a complete understanding and watch his next word positionally positionally of what we are in jesus christ and sometimes i think that preaching is a wonderful thing but i believe sometimes brother bealer that teaching goes beyond that it kind of especially to the church everybody still believe brother brown was a prophet believe what he said okay some of you don't that's your problem but teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are never rightly have faith everybody believe brother brown was a prophet okay we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know know what we are everybody got that now let's read these next few right here there's one long one and i'll read it but brother brown explains it way better than i do so brother brown look what we're talking about this morning a couple weeks ago now what is adoption let's get this now i don't know whether i won't have time to get through this but i'll hit it then if there's a question you can ask me a little later on something to message sometime your adoption is not your birth scroll on up um so that they can see it your adoption is not your birth two different things but you can't have one without the other but you can have a new birth without being adopted but you can receive the spirit of adoption when you're born again so what is it folks it's what we do with it god's not going to pull you up that statue of perfect man if you don't want to go the holy ghost is a gentleman if you want to stay right here and say well just well that's what the pentecostals did and i'm saying this with extreme caution and extreme um in my heart when you watch most people in this message that's what they got they got the holy ghost and they shout the house down but no teaching he said that's where pentecost failed and a lot of people are just pentecostals and moving over into the message nothing wrong with that folks they're going to be there just like me and you but there's going to have to be a place that somebody is going to have to bring that headstone back not be a baby not be a pentecostal baby and you can't be a babe you can't stay a baby and have these virtues working in your life your adoption is not your birth and i will do that we'll pull it apart because i want to show you the two characteristics of each one but your adoption is your placing i'm the bus driver someone has taught me how to drive i have my driver's license to drive a bus so i know that's my position someone else raises their hand i know i'm the tour guide i didn't get my license to drive a bus somebody taught me how to be a guide in other words then you got other than that you got 50 people sitting on the bus and it's just sitting there somebody got to step up and drive a thing somebody got to step up and be the tour guide when you're born again john 1 17 i believe when you're born again of the spirit you are sons of god but look folks we were predestinated every age was predestinated we know that for a fact but what are we predestinated into adoption according to the scripture we'll read it later but we were predestinated now here's what i'm trying to get you to for this sons of the last day not luther not wesley not pentecost today to see we were predestinated to unto adoption now here we are now this is what hurts pentecostal a little bit they say i got born again praise the lord god the holy ghost brother brown said fine [Music] but yet that ain't what i'm talking about see you were predestinated into adoption adoption is placing a son we'll get into that play i want to get to the placing part but now let's let's read this real quick and this is that big old word that brother dale can't pronounce it's called bar mitzvah okay it's it's a jewish tradition bar mitzvah bar means son of remember you are simon barjona he knew that barjona that jonah was his son he was jonas's son simon barjona all right so bar mitzvah is son of the promise son of and mitzvah means promise so what they do in in that stage is is they take them at 13 or 14 years old whenever they're able to pass some tests that sound familiar whenever they're able to pass some tests not fail them pass some tests when they're able to pass some tests the father says okay now you can read scripture in the you can read the torah because before then you couldn't even touch it that thing's so sacred they don't let kids handle the word that's why jesus being who he was under the law he pops up at 13 years old and he's reading scripture in the temple because he went through his bar mitzvah but he's fixing to go through one spiritually on that mount transfiguration he went through a bar mitzvah up there and the whole world whole world us saw it so now look when this child was born he became a son the very moment he was born in the family you get it brother brown was trying to get him to see it now there was a tutor over this boy to educate him and to raise him up well he was no more than a servant said the galatian letter until he came to an age a certain limited time that he was set and this tutor would always take the father's word father take the father word your son is progressing or whatever it was and now that's where i'm not disagreeing my dear brother but here to take it from one here take it as from one who loves you you know he's talking to his talking pentecost because look he said there's where pentecost failed to see this and if the holy spirit and and don't get me wrong i'm i'm trying to i've been battling this thing all week we're not a special group of people but yet we are okay but let god pronounce that we're special not you let god toot your horn if you become the right son he will because you know what he's going to do he's going to say here's my son now if that boy if that boy at about 12 years old give me that torah walks into the sanctuary where he shouldn't be at that age picks up the book starts reading it no one would listen to him because he was out of order but there's an order to everything when the son turned 13 years old and he was a good child he studied he read he knew how to read then the father would take him out and say hey i'm placing this son in a position because he can do things now he can read the bible he can do part of the things in the now he couldn't do everything in the sanctuary but he could at least go in there now why but if he was not if he was a rebellious child if he only come to church every once in a while see if the holy spirit may be not willing to give it then look when you were born again of the holy ghost you said this is it brother and that's why he said pentecost is it that's what you see in the message i'm sorry don't get me wrong me and you do the same thing we like to go to meetings where there's a little bit of emotion right because we're humans and we like to feel good but i thought i just read where teaching places you in the body listen you don't know what you're shouting about unless you're positionally placed where you're supposed to be you're just tooting a whistle like pentecost did they have these pentecostal meetings where you've been to meetings before where they're they're already amen in the brother before he even says a word how they gonna understand that i told one brother one time i said they failed ever let me do that i'd trick every one of them i started preaching some false doctrine and i'd see what they always amended about because they just go jesus is the third person of trinity there's nothing wrong with a pentecostal revival but i would not want it all the time i need some teaching because i want to be i want to be positionally played listen there's no power in pentecost pentecost has lived this day why is he saying that right there there's where pentecost failed to see this and if we keep that pentecost here emotion not the pentecost 2000 years ago we failed it's why we've been here 60 years we failed to see that there's further growth and somebody needs to teach us that look when you were born again of the holy ghost you said this is it brother it was you was a child everybody still brother brown was a prophet right everybody okay all right you was just as much child as you ever could be you were born in the family but yet the tudor which is the holy ghost has watched over the church as it's been maturity all right keep going now this tutor in the natural went to the father and said now that boy's not going to be very good i tried to teach him and he just won't listen he's got his own head strong way boy that hit us all and he just won't listen he's going to be this or he's going to be that the father realizes right then that that boy cannot take over his domain that didn't make him not a son god can't give you the holy ghost and then take it back not an indian giver but he can give you the holy ghost and i love what the prophet said the prophet said the holy ghost is a timid person a gentleman a gentleman if you don't want to go do this he's not going to make you do it if you don't want to go and get some more virtue and get some more knowledge and get some more temperance it's your choice the father realizes right then that that boy cannot take over his domain that's right because what would he do he'd run it through look the return of the prodigal son gives a very beautiful picture of it what did he do he went out in the world and did what squandered his wealth right see he could not what he would do would be mortgage to farm or sell it off and drink it up and run around now the spiritual sense after we were born again in christ we become children of god but then see god knows best now here's what i say reverently disagreeing with the latter reign brethren you think i'm persecuting you think i'm persecuting church no my dear brother and neither am i everybody has their place but there's got to be a place folks where god can speak through us just like he spoke to his son and you can't do that being a baby jesus christ was not a baby when he was transfigured on that mountain he was a 30 year old man that had been through all his life now this boy after he got a certain age he had to be adopted into that same family he was born into any minister knows it's the placing of a son he had to be adopted into the family that he was born into could you imagine that but that's the old testament teaching paul's referring to here in ephesians the church of ephesus now the thing of it is brother we have tried to make each one here and each one this and each one laying on of hands and separating or getting setting apart we've made that but god has to do that the only one can do it now when the father became aware that this boy was not worthy he never disowned him are you with me just a few minutes he never disowned him he was still his boy [Music] but he couldn't put confidence in him he was too carried away about all kinds of winds of doctrine everybody believe brother brown was a prophet okay believe what he said okay i'm not being redundant like that i'm just going to make sure that you understand that this is what the prophet god's saying i'm not making this up that's what the scripture says be not carried about by every wind of doctrine be stable always abounding in the work of the lord for so much as you know your works is not in vain quickly wish we could stay on that a while but notice let's get on this is the long quote but finish in a minute this father then the day come when this boy maybe he'd been all right and he was a worthy man he listened to the father he took instructions hello take instructions from your daddy he listened to instructions he was a good boy then the father the son didn't just jump up and say i'm ready to be adopted daddy take me out there bless god i can do it you'll fail but if the father ever takes you out there he took instructions the father taking him out to a public street put special clothes on him and then the father what clothes is it faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity then the father had a ceremony and adopted this son into the family paul's saying here having predestinated us into the adoption seat unto the adoption moses was a pre-figure of it and when this son after he came out there he was given no longer was he just a servant under a tutor he was the boss he was the boss i hope that soaks real deep he was the boss but what kind of boss was he did he rule with a rod of iron or did he rule with wisdom did he rule with patience virtue knowledge temperance godliness brotherly kindness that makes you a real son it's when these virtues can be lived in your life and the world can see it that quote before that the world god just takes him out and says look he took william branham out there in arizona may i may i go there we believe brother brown was adopted don't we that's the only reason he could preach the sales because it wasn't brother around preaching the seals it was god preaching them amen took him out there and showed the whole world if y'all never seen that um brother joe i think he put it on our website where that brother um can't remember remember his last name up in uh at brother luke gibson's church that scientifically proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that cloud could not be man-made you could not realize how many hundreds of millions of gallons of water that a vapor from a rocket would have to produce to make a cloud 26 miles and 30 something miles high every 26 miles high 30 something miles long how many millions and hundreds of millions of gallons of water vapor because that's what that is the cloud is water vapor and he proves it scientifically there's no way a rocket made it it'd be like us trying to prove that we blew up that we blew up the state capitol with a firecracker humanly impossible but god placed his son and said here you him this was the second part of his message people not the first part not in the years of preparation what he's trying to get pentecost to get out of pentecost hello trying to get him out then he wanted to place us then he began to preach his message then he began to preach the seals because still the seals places you what else does [Music] the seals places you in the body tells you who you are what you're doing here and where you're going that which was which is and is to come brother brown said that's what the seal showed still shows what was what is and what is to come amen you love the lord listen just like everything in the world musicians come it's not for everybody [Music] it's not for everybody but i want you to say it's for you i want you to decide it's for you because you know what i believe that's what a teacher does a teacher simplifies hello somebody yeah anna my sister simplifies it so a kindergartener can understand but see that but see though wait a minute you got calculus unknown numbers binary numbers a plus b is c all this stuff that's no more than one plus one is two if it's taught right i understood calculus because i was a math major i understood calculus as much as i did my abcs and one two threes one plus one equals two two plus two equals what four but there's what am i saying there's a basis that you and i got to come to and that's the new birth let's stand our feet we to come to the new birth know you got it know that you know you know and then what have i told you since the beginning of this series whatever you got folks please let it out let it do what it's supposed to do open up [Music] and let the butterfly out anybody ever seen those kakedas or whatever they are they stuck on the side of a tree and there's nothing but a shell there and there's a crack down the back of it that all of a sudden you look up in the in the um and the flowers and what's what's there pretty butterfly that butterfly came from that ugly thing that's hanging on the tree that ugly thing was me and you hanging on the tree but you know what there was a man went hung on the tree for us so that he could do what release his butterfly and his butterfly could come into you and you can make a butterfly and you can make a butterfly and everybody could hey seed life comes through the body folks there's no way you can get it outside of listening to the message of the hour i mean message the hour i mean the message of the hour i ain't meaning just the message the message of the hour begins with you must be born again but it does not con stay right there you've got to come to maturity just like you've got children that you want to see them mature and you have to give them a little protoplasmic stimulation every once in a while to get them right back in line so does god have to do us the same thing but like i said before do we take it as a learning experience or do we take it and get mad at him it's all on how you take it let's sing a song amen i'll fly away god bless you we love you with the love of the lord remember all these announcements if you have a need we need to really pray for the ones that are sick pray that they'll get back next weekend and be with us and this thing won't go around again and again and again okay only believe all things are possible [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] listen you gotta know where you're [Music] that he knows where he's going and he's got a crew of people that know what they're doing and the maintenance guy has done his job if everybody does their job i'm going to get to my destination safely that's the same way with me and you trust the people that are taking you where you're [Music] prison bars [Music] [Music] lord i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ of whatever situation this is put on the lord that it will take care of lord and the lord it'll be a testimony another one and another testimony of what's going on we pray in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh i can [Music] [Music] few more days [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm [Music] fly away in the morning [Music] best musicians in the world [Music] gonna [Applause] [Music] [Music] you know there was a dispensation when that man that wrote that song that's all they knew he wrote exactly what god gave him inspiration to write whoever that was right that's all he knew be a christian and one day i'm going to fly away but i'm going to have to die right you hear all those songs it has death in it when this weary life is over you know but we've had an updated revelation we can sing i can't die i'll be raptured by and by we're not changing the man he had a good revelation of his time but what about now like i said before what about this time this is the time this is the manifestation of the sons of god these are the sons of god and daughters of god that's going to be in position and you're going to see things happen that you've never seen before pray to god to help you get in your position amen pray to god that you get in your position all right all mine's clear we'll beat wednesday night brother bob will be preaching brother richard high to be here with us this weekend coming up so you just pray that god will be with us be with brother dale the different ones be with the new baby and the mama and all these that are sick with kobe that they'll be done and finished and be back here on on sunday so we asked you to just be with uh uh mary kamani has a special unspoken request we're gonna pray over some prayer closets and then we're gonna give him to her so you just pray you stay back there it's okay i'll bring them to you you don't have to come up here you know that's another thing we i was just reading a quote well brother brown talking about it he said altar calls would never in the bible he said that was some of that was prostrating before an idol you bow down get down before an idol but we still we're okay for you to come up here but the gentile way never was that the gentile way was you just say it i believe who's talking and it'll come to pass that's what god's looking for he's looking for a bride that'll take him by his word always by his word and not have to have a feeling or any motion or even touching i'm just telling you brother brown said altar calls we're not even in the bible prayer lines are not in the bible [Music] the centurion said i have authority position i have position and i realize that he might even know jesus's name he said but i realize there's something different about you and you have a power over the demons i have a power over a hundred people i tell them to go they go i tell them to come they come he said i believe you got the same what was he telling him he was testifying that that man was going whatever he spoke the devil was going to have to flee from it now why can't we be the same way that centaurian he was a gentile he was a a roman that probably lord he was a heathen but he realized that man had authority when we're going to realize that god give us that same authority to not have to lay hands that we can just speak the word and then while the word was spoke over there every how many miles away that kid was healed i love laying on hands that's okay prayer lines are okay but that's not going to get us out of speaking the words going to get us out of here and speaking it right at the right time at the right day the right hour let's bow our heads dearly father thank you for this day pray that what we've said been pleasing to you lord we love this group of people lord we pray that you just raise us all up lord up the statue of perfect man growth where we won't be babies and run around have to be patted all over the place lord and powdered and baby fed that we'll take the word of god lord and take the sword and stick it to the heart of the devil and do it with a mighty hand and not with something lord that we don't know what to deal with lord we know what that sword is you told the prophet when that sword came down in his hand oh i i it just makes me rejoice when the prophet said it fit my hand perfectly see it wasn't a sword for anybody else it was a sword for him and lord we've got to have a sword in the hand experience where our hands are raised lord and one day you'll put a word in our hand lord that we'll get out of this place and the dead in christ shall rise lord i expect that to happen because the word said it would happen and i pray lord that we will come to that place quickly lord so that we can get
