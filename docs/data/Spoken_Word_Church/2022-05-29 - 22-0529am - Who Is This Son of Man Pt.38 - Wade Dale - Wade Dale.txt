leader and the good church brother shambo been watching some of his services he's like me i'm on part 38 he's on like part 80 something with ruth so so i really don't bother me to be on part 38. so but i'm not going two and a half to three hours okay y'all just be still maybe some other time but anyway congratulations and may god bless you and i want us to pray if you don't mind now let's stand i want to pray and they've been engaged so they are going to get married the wedding will be later on in the year they can announce that their self but we want to pray for them and their journey between now and then i know it's going to be stressful for them to get all the well ladies you know what it is but it's going to be your day it doesn't matter if he comes in blue jeans and a t-shirt but it's going to be your day and we're proud to have you here part of our family always so let's bow our heads and let's all pray that that everything goes well when we get to the wedding part all that'll go well and then the life together we know they're going to have ups and downs because we all still do but you know what with the holy ghost it makes them where you can work your way through amen so so i believe that they're born again filled with the holy spirit so they'll know how to handle some of this stuff you got a good you got a good foundation to start with so let's bow our heads dear lord jesus thank you for our brother and sister lord i pray now that lord as we see this union coming together that father it will not be just a union that man has put together but one that god has put together because you said what man puts together sometimes can fail but what god puts together let no man break asunder father be with him lord and take care of them be with them in the process of of getting a home and getting started with with the wedding and all the things that life lord we pray that you'd be with them and it'll go smoothly bless brother john and sister edie lord as we now there's two families and brother bob and sister monica bringing them together lord as families we're all still the family of jesus christ we're the bride but now we're bringing natural families together lord and we pray that you would protect them lord keep your mighty hand upon them lord and bless them lord through this journey to the days of the wedding and then after that lord may they just live in bliss father may they live number one for you and number two then for each other father just bless them take care of them be with them this day in jesus name amen god bless you proud to know you man prayer to know you both amen all right let's read the scripture we're going to preach here in just a minute let's go to john 1 1. like i said we're on part 38 of who is this son of man we know that we know who that is and it's god made flesh but it wasn't god made flesh just 2000 years ago it wasn't god made flesh 60 years ago in the prophet it was god made flesh in you and the word was made flesh so let's go to john 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and what happened the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day we appreciate the time we have lord with this group of people lord i pray that you bind us together closer to you lord his brother aaron was talking about bitterness on wednesday night lord don't ever let that root of bitterness come in lord cut that thing off lord as we bind closer and closer together that we as we see the union of of sister lily and brother zach lord we pray that they'll bind closer together each one of us too is husband and wife and parents and all we should bind together lord to defeat this devil as i've always said i want the devil to be uncomfortable in this place and the holy ghost to be so comfortable that he just breaks out into shouting and screaming lord praise god for that we have an opportunity today lord to hear from you now father i pray that you would do the speaking that they would do the hearing lord and as you would give the revelation we give this all to you lord in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you can be seated so we get started a little bit the background some will go to romans 10 verse 8. i want to read a little quote you know they send the quote of the day uh from the voice of god but i like this one this is from the intervale they don't have it so i'm just going to read it to you but brother adam says look i may not be a good preacher but i know what i'm talking about he said friends i know that a man without a new birth is alien from god amen he knows not of god i know you've got to accept that experience if you're ever going to heaven wow if he doesn't have that experience he will in no wise enter the kingdom the prophet of god said no matter how good you've been how well you treat your neighbor how well you went to church how you supported it that's all good that has nothing to do with it except a man be born again listen to this a mysterious birth that sends you out yonder into a spear now he just told us that we were if we were not born again we were aliens to god but now once you get born again he's fixing to tell you you're going to be an alien everybody believe brother brown was a prophet i just want to make sure we got the right crowd here today a mysterious birth that sends you out yonder into a spear that you know nothing of when you're an alien though you go to church and try to do right still that isn't in it friend are you born again these ques the question is are you born again washed in the blood of the lamb you will become an alien you'll become an alien to this world all you that were baptized sunday something was planted now let's see it grow amen let's see it in your works let's see it you say oh brother wait it's not words no it is after you get born again you got something to do as we've been talking about the son of man he didn't just become a baby and then he went and died at calvary he had a journey he lived through life just like me and you god in human flesh well what are we today about the baptism of the holy ghost you and i are god in human flesh amen but a mysterious birth the world don't understand when you say born again there's like nicodemus they say why how in the world am i gonna have to go back into my mother's womb and be born again jesus said nope gotta be born from above so those of you that were baptized you're on a good start seek the baptism of the holy ghost if you don't have it pray to god that you grow and you know what a plant is supposed to do is supposed to produce fruit i planted a garden the other day and i've got corn up about this high i want some fruit off of that well what's gonna happen i'm gonna have to give it some water i'm gonna have to get a little bit of fertilizer and i'm gonna have to cultivate it a little bit so once we do that and god sends the rain and we give the nutrients to it guess what about the end of july 1st of august i'm going to have some air corn and we're going to be able to eat that so that's what i want with god i want us to be where we can eat that fruit everybody can enjoy the fruit and everybody can enjoy the presence of god we want we should long for the presence of god more than anything we love each other but we love the presence of god and the quietness of the prayer time and the quietness of reading your bible and the quietness in the morning i told we were talking about something yesterday and where were we at we were always working josh's in-laws i said the best cup of coffee is a quiet cup of coffee hey man the best cup of coffee it's a quiet cup of coffee you get quiet in the morning you get that cup of coffee and that's the most important cup of coffee because you're talking to god or you're reading your bible or something's going on that's quiet coffee is what i like now it's time to be shouting over sprite and diet coke and all whatever ginger ale whatever you want to drink but i want that quiet coffee in the morning so that we can talk to god romans 10 verse 8 says but what saith it the word is nigh thee even thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if you should confess with your mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thy heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for when the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation we've been talking like i said 38 sermons on the son of man and and brother john we're we're still down at uh we're still down at faith on the bottom of the pyramid and and i want to tell y'all something y'all think i use a lot of charts y'all think i'd draw on a white board go to sparkling word tabernacle go to sparkle word tabernacle look up stephen chambo he's got a double white board right brother john forsyth that's right because he flips him over he's got a thing right here and it's four-sided an hour for each side but it's full by the time it's finished it's a beautiful picture so we're going i'm scaring them i don't want to scare the people but they don't have a second service we do so we kind of timely we got to stop and start over again so but brother stevens i've never met the brother but he's a good teacher he's a good teacher if you want to ever watch him online stephen chambers spoke about tabernacle right tabernacle yeah okay almost like spoken word church but we've been doing this for 50 years so we we got dibs on the we own the domain you can't ever be a spoken word church part two but we know that we've been we we have fun down here brother john but we know that we're predestinated to adoption we're not just predestined to get born again that's what we've been trying to stay down at the bottom of the pyramid but we got to go somewhere we've got a job we've got to as brother bob was talking about we've got to come under this son of man revelation and we know that brother branham will read the well we're not gonna read the quote i took it out but you ought to know that brother brown said your your birth is not your adoption two different things amen you can't be adopted without being born again but you can be born again and not be adopted because we're going to talk about this afternoon we're going to bring some quotes where brother brown talks about doors and doors where even when god comes into your house there's still doors there and that's what that's what these virtues are for you say well i don't god i don't want you behind that door and many times brother john i told him i said if i was the holy ghost i'd be knocking it down but brother brown said god the holy ghost was a timid god if you don't let him in he ain't gonna knock the door he's standing at the door knocking me and you we would have the battle axe and we would have we'd have the we'd have everything we needed to knock that door down and find out what's going on but remember patience we're going to talk about those virtues if we ever get to it but it's not your birth so let's look at the first chart if y'all want to bring the the one up that we um that we've been using but we know that adoption is in three stages brother dale's preaching on this many many many times so we're just kind of um redoing it again and and and preaching it lord in our in our revelation which is exactly like his not that one the first one i'm sorry i told him to get that one but we're going to talk about that one in a minute but bring the first one up that's the statue of a perfect man that has the uh justification sanctification the baptism in the holy ghost i'm sorry brothers that's my fault but in this three stages of adoption what's the first stage you've got to be born again you've got to get into the family of god amen israel was in the family of god before their journey they were born the fam they were born the family of god they they were israel they were god's chosen people so they were not in their wilderness journey they didn't become jews they didn't become israel they were the children of israel amen before their journey they were the children of israel so but we believe as brother brown did in dispensations we believe in god in stepping stepping stones they'll find it a man that's cute they'll find it in a minute we say pretty but as many as led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god so now we're going to start at the new birth and when they find that other picture they get it up there for me in just a minute for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption the spirit of adoption not adoption the spirit of adoption where you cry daddy daddy i'm in my crying stage i'm still in diapers but you know even even when you're born natural birth you're born what body spirit and soul amen but can you drive a car just as soon as you're born no way but you have every faculty your hands you've got you don't grow eyes you don't grow toes you don't grow feet you've got all that so brother brown tells us at the new birth you get everything you need for your journey all right well now you can either put it on a shelf and leave it there and let it rot there we go so that's the chart we've been using and i believe brother bob did that and we kind of just tweaked it a little bit but you don't get into the body of christ until you get to the new birth there is no way you can get the virtue of god without having the new birth now you can have natural virtue you can have natural knowledge natural listen satan's got natural knowledge the devil himself has got so much knowledge i'll read it to you in just a minute judas was in the ministry of jesus christ wow brother brown said he was justified and sanctified wow the devil himself anointed ones his brother bob was talking about the anointed ones that it's like we're going to read the quote later on this this afternoon that without these virtues you're a stumbling block to the believer because what you're doing is everybody wants to jump all the way up here and say well we're in this right here not yet you're not you're in the layout of seeing church age but you're not at brotherly kindness as soon as you get born again i'll promise you that amen and you should know that through your journey you should know where you're at at any time as what the prophet of god said but we're going to talk today about what we call brother john is baby form justification because baby form justification is you get your your sins chopped off but you still sin you're still sin you're still a sinner you're not even the body of christ even in sanctification that's what we've been talking about everybody says well how do you know you're born again i know brother bob covered it this morning but how you know you're born again well i quit drinking i quit smoking i quit gambling i started going to church that's and i started believing the message oh you can't you gotta leave that you can't leave that one out listen the devil comes to church more than y'all do he believes the message part of it and he believes part of the word because he wants to be like god he wants to have his own word right so close that's what it is it's so close we'll deceive the very lack if it were possible but if you ever get bored again and sealed in you can't stay deceived you might be deceived but you can't stay deceived amen but you've received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry daddy daddy or father father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god you're not the children of god because you quit drinking smoking cussing and what i call is a laundry list do's and don'ts that's right that just means you're a good person or you've you've you know you've alcohol it's anonymous or whatever you want to call it you know i just quit i you know i quit doing things sometimes when i was a center i'd quit doing stuff did that mean i was born again no no i didn't care anything about god i'm sorry i didn't oh you all did oh okay still believe brother brown was a prophet right believe his teaching well i guess some of you do know some of you didn't raise your hand there's another church right over there if you need to go but justification baby form justification is you get your sins chopped off it's put in the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered again and you are on your way to the kingdom amen because it it is a work of the holy ghost but you and i can get off that train anytime we want to because you're a free moral agent oh no i got this hello we'll get to that in a little bit so justification chops off your past says god puts it in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered again but you and i still remember and you and i still have that as brother brown calls his brother aaron will talk about that root of bitterness is still there you still have a soul that is black everybody with me but now when we become the children of god we become heirs and join errors so we get whatever christ gets that's what we get only if you're born again only you have may have went through justification sanctification in the baptism of the holy ghost so let's go to justification what we're talking about here it says look but what saith that the word is nigh the even thy mouth and in the heart that is the word of faith which we preach that's what we're talking about just a second ago that if you shall confess with your mouth the lord jesus and believe in thy heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness god knows if you're sorry for what you did you know you've heard the old phrase you find jesus in jail you believe in jesus because you got caught yeah that ain't justification no you're trying to justify yourself i want the justifier the one that don't have it to begin with i want him to clean start cleaning me up i want him to justify me i don't want to justify myself a lot of problem is we justify ourselves for when the heart believeth under righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation that's what you do when you first start as we were talking about last week in the baptismal service a lot of people just get baptized because their buddy gets baptized or they feel like they need to get baptized again but peter said repent repent and be baptized that's our problem we miss that step of justification repent and then go to the water and then let us kill you we're going to a funeral today right somebody is going to die if you'll let it the old you is going to pass away behold all things are going to become new or the bible tells us in romans in newness of life so we're going to come up in newness of life and leave that old stuff in that water amen romans 3 verse 24 is being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus listen baby form justification is absolutely a part of your redemption because you got to get your sins chopped off you got to get give god something to start working on amen whom god has sent forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness look and i believe this is where brother branham i know he got a he's a prophet and he got revelation but where did he get it from he got it from the bible he got him from the bible brother brown says you get your past sins chopped off i've heard preachers pray in this message lord forgive me for my future sins that's a bunch of bull that's catholicism it says right here righteousness for the remission of sins that are past you got to do it first through the forbearance thank the lord of god to declare i say at this time his righteousness not yours that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus where is boasting then it is excluded by what love works nay but by the law of faith therefore we conclude i like paul paul brings you something he'll bring you scripture and he'll bring you a whole chapter and then all of a sudden he'll say in conclusion this is what i was talking about therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law god forgive me but now remember the next justification when we get into the body of christ we don't throw justification away we have to continue on with that justification god forgive me of my sins i ask him every day to forgive me of my sins christians are the only ones that have sins if we'd realized we were sinners first and that we still have sins in our second realm if you're born again you don't sin in your soul you know that but we've got memory reason conscious effects and imagination that we have to deal with memory is what kills me my reasoning my consciousness of this world my imagination god don't imagine so where's that come from that comes from the devil god doesn't imagine when god thinks it happens he don't imagine something happening he's already seen it happen so that's what we've got to get to we've got to get to that faith it's the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things what not seen not sick have you did you see jesus get crucified did you see him resurrect but i sure believe it and i sure know that's that one that did it's inside of me that way i know that i can really believe it not just that he did it 2000 years ago but he's still doing it now so now let's go to sanctification see this is where that sometimes without good teaching it's what i said before brother dale when he first came in the message in 1968 what'd they ask him he's told you a hundred times well brother dale i know you got born again because you came out of the baptist church and now you're in the message right bob he said i was not he said i was two years seeking the holy ghost he ought to know two years seeking the holy ghost before he got born again so he went through the mat two years of the message of learning and studying and praying before god giving the baptism of the holy ghost so don't tell me that you just got it because you're sitting in church today or you just got it because you you don't wear pants or you don't want cut that's do's and don'ts but sanctification should get that unclean spirit out of you not at the new birth at sanctification all those things should go out of you see that's a dangerous part when we when we look at that we see that the devil can tell you at sanctification oh you're fine you're born again you're going to church aren't you you believe the message of the hour you're not doing this you're not doing that what'd bob say this morning one identification the greatest one is that this message of this hour is revealed to you over and over and over again and you don't just sit here with a bewildered look on your face no you're getting something limbs are growing leaves are growing fruit's growing something's happening and i believe we're in a stage where something's happening now something's happening to all of us the ones that's coming in the ones that's been baptized re-baptized we've rededicated our life so what i told you first of the year i said whatever you got let it out whether it be good bad or indifferent let it out my whole football coach said what lead follow or get out of the way and that's the way i look at it lead follower get out of the way and don't stand in somebody's way please don't let us stand in anybody's way matthew 12 43 says when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man what all that junk that you used to do and it didn't leave of its own accord it's just like i said about the ark there was a lot of claw marks on that ark when god shut the door same way with them evil spirits oh i just it just fell out of me and i'm just yeah right no i fought mine and there were some scratch marks going out the door as he went out he didn't want to leave but i did go through a stage of sanctification where i was cleaned out the snuff box did go out the door the cursing did go out the door that whatever i was doing went out the door sanctification but i had been taught well by brother dale because i could have come in and sat down and said well that's my birth that was not my birth i still was confused on matters and confused on certain things that i were that i was reading in the message of the hour but when god gave me the baptism of the holy ghost brother john all that come pieces come together and god started building a man a stature of a perfect man so that's just for the preachers now it's for the kids it's for the young ladies it's for the young men it's for all of you to come to this to come to this and listen it'll make your life better what we reading in second peter it's life and godliness it's telling you how to live your life and live it godly listen folks we're going to have problems the holy ghost will not take all your problems away but it will help you get through them amen and you'll be better on the other side when the unclean spirit is going out of a man he walketh through dry places seek and rest and find us none then he said i will return where into my house he's still got possession of it read your bible into my house from whence i came out this is an evil spirit talking i'm comfortable in that house right there but something has made me uncomfortable something has thrown me out and i look though he's come back and he finds it empty swept and garnished you start going to church i'll read to you in just a few minutes he goes and taketh what he's going to bring seven of his buddies and he's not going you're not gonna be a seven time more drunk he's gonna put you in church he's going to bring seven religious demons with him and they're going to put you in a message church and you're going to sit there and say i'm fine listen brother dale's 82 years old he's been in this message for 60 something years i don't believe there's a day he woke up and said i'm fine right pop i'm fine no it's a struggle it's a battle listen we'll talk about tonight or this afternoon even when joshua placed them in the promised land that was blessed there was battles there was heartaches in the promised land in this adoption stage so get ready brother brown said he's going to turn every gun satan is because he likes his he wants his house back because i remember brother brown said he's got dibs on you because you were born in sin shape and iniquity okay and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be unto this wicked generation second timothy 2 verse 19 says nevertheless the foundation of god stands sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also wood and earth some of honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore purge himself remember clean and set aside for service you're not in service yet you're in line for adoption but you're not even in the family yet all right if a man therefore purge himself from these he should be a vessel and honor what he made a choice we have a choice satan had a choice the angels had a choice abel had a choice cain had a choice adam had a choice eve had a choice if the devil himself had a choice so do you god made a choice god chose us yes he didn't choose to stay by himself he chose to have a mini-member body a bride hallelujah and meet for the white master's use and prepared unto every good work that's sanctification that's not the new birth it's heading you toward that it's a work of the holy ghost but remember that thing's not sealed yet whatever was inside can get back in you got a what you got to seal it and then what then what's good to seal this oh brother i got this water sealed it can't get out i want to drink this so god's going to break the cell um remember the boxcar brother brown talks about when i watched inside that boxcar junk no he said goods in other words a boxcar full of of say chicken this is chicken country but what's a box box car full of chicken gonna do you if it stays in a box car amen but it's sealed but at that in that journey somewhere that seal is going to have to be broke and then what's inside is going to have to come out that's what i said before whatever you got inside of you let it out good bad or indifferent so now watch judas this carrot was justified by faith oh my lord and believed on the lord jesus christ and was baptized everybody still believed brother brown was a prophet i hadn't we're still here okay all right thank you and believing on the lord jesus christ and was baptized and the bible said jesus baptized the disciples his disciples all right so before he could send them out he said sanctify them father so now we're at sanctification but now remember it can't be the sanctification right here that he puts you ready in service in the body he's still down here you're not in the body of christ yet everybody with me all right what's that thing brother stephen says all the time he'll say something to the congregation he'll say you know are you with me or he'll say are you hearing me or something it's cute i like it you have to get them every once in a while get their attention back sanctify them father through the truth that word we have to get them before they go to land or nod you'll get that in a minute thy word is truth and he was the word even before the atonement was made and what's the atonement the holy ghost before the atonement was made in other words as a preview father of my shed blood blood i sanctify these he gave them power against unclean spirits they went out and they cast out devils is that right they healed the sick they came back sanctified rejoicing jumping shouting and praising god doesn't that sound like a good message meeting and said even the devils is subject to us and jesus said don't you rejoice because the devil's accepted to you but rejoice because your names are written in the book of heaven is that right and judas iscariot was with them one of them i'm one of them see jesus the judas can sing that same song one of them i'm one of them yeah he was one of them all right but he fooled everybody listen to me this is this this is the point i want to make he fooled everybody but the son of man and that's what we're trying to get to we get to the message of the son of man not the son of god to the son of man i'm sorry to the son of man everybody with me the son of man is the only one that knew where satan was all the other all the other church ages were they were just scrambling around trying to figure out what's going on and right up to the right up to the crucifixion they was like well jesus is a good guy judas has been messaged for 30 years he was called just like we were we've seen it happen before brother john's seen it itself personally walk through life and think these people are saints of god called out sanctified and his name was written in the lounge book of white but remember it wasn't written in the eternal section because his name was erased said read matthew 10 and see if that's not right he called each one of them and judas and every one of them right down there he sent them out and gave them power against unclean spirits jesus knew who he was and still sanctified him but he didn't go to pentecost that's his problem he did not go to pentecost so let's read this next one from a hidden life i love this little sermon here how the thing was refreshing in the presence notice another thing once in the presence of god hold on a minute brother branham once in the presence of god we're supposed to be shouting and speaking in tongues and we still believe one more time is everybody all right well brother brown was the prophet we believe what do you see you get quieted because if you don't know what you're shouting about first you're just shouting that like brother brown said you're just tooting your whistle but if you get quieted first be still and know that i'm god be still and know that i have the new birth and that's why i'm shouting not why not i'm shouting because everybody else is shouting not shouting because of that anointing as brother was talking about that it's not a false anointing listen it's not a false holy ghost it's the true holy ghost on a false believer that's the problem that we see annoying ones at the end time it's a true holy ghost anointing someone that's black in their soul because they haven't been taught right they think they're fine they think everything's all right and they're not once in the presence of god you get quieted you're not tossed about by everything you know where you're standing there something happens you know that you've been in contact with somebody that loves you wow you know that something's happened down here and it's refreshing and not only that but you will refresh others well since i got a new bird boat away people can't stand to be around me you need to get a new birth you don't need just an anointing you need to get the new birth amen i know some of y'all can't stand to be around me but that's your fault you [Applause] quit clapping yeah i know it keeps you from sleeping i know that you've seen people that was nice people but you just couldn't hardly stand to be around them there's something about them they got a creative power around them that just seems to be different how i'd like to stop here if it was possible to tell you something on that you're a little creator yourself wow now this is why i brought this in because he's talking about sanctification he's over there in in the old testament talking about the new spirit and the old and the stony heart and the heart of flesh because everybody thinks they get the new birth and they're not they just get a new spirit watch he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't god's spirit right right everybody with me he's quoting the bible i can't remember the ezekiel i think it is thank you and that spirit isn't god's spirit now listen what is the holy ghost that's god's spirit the holy ghost is god's spirit inside of you that's the new birth so he's not talking about that he said that spirit isn't god's spirit that's your spirit everybody's still with me still believe brother okay all right don't leave god gives you a new spirit then he says i'll put my spirit in him but the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and what huh settle down you see people that's tossed about i've said before we all got a boat we're all a big boat but what runs the boat that one rudder in the bottom of that boat is only about this big that boat can be as big as this room and that rudder about that big and about that long if it's not on that every wind is going to blow you this way and that other wind is going to blow you that way i'm going to blow you to that church i'm going to blow you i'll get off of that but anyway so god gives you a spiritual rudder that when that wind blows you can turn it doesn't matter if it turns the ship i was telling you before we were flying into canada to bear hunt me and dad were and we were on a puddle jumper and i couldn't see the runway brother john all i saw was trees we were coming in sideways the wind was like 40 miles an hour across wind i was looking out the sidewinder and i said uh that's the runway i was looking at the pilot over here because it was polo jumpers that didn't have the doors you could see the pilot but what happened was they had a rudder they had a tail rudder and they had rudder on the wing so what happened right as soon as we got close to that they turned that rudder when they did we sit right down on the runway just like we're supposed to that's the same way with god we have a spiritual rudder now that gives us what it gives us purpose when we turn that thing it's because the wind's blowing this way if we turn it back this way because the wind's blowing this way so he had to get you fixed up first before he can come in you wow no i just got it's okay you might have got it all at one time that's all right show me the fruits don't don't lay out a church and be in six weeks and be gone and be done this and can't do this and can't do that and don't live for god you didn't get it let's just really be honest with each other if you got the holy ghost you'll be in church well i got that no god didn't ask about no stipulations so he has to get you fixed up first before he can come in i'll give you a new spirit then you take him anywhere you go all kinds of places what you don't go to the bar rooms anymore right you don't go to the hockey's home you don't go to this place in that place you go to a different place you go all kinds of places he's got to get you fixed so he can what so you can entertain him right so that's when you're on the first altar you're not born again yet but when you hide away and get his spirit then the holy spirit none other than god himself comes and dwells in you and that's right here that's at the new birth at the baptism of holy ghost that's that faith to put you in the body that he can put you in service you're not in service yet without the holy ghost and then there's something about you the neighbor loves you the people likes you let's read first peter one verse two elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through what sanctification of the spirit what is sanctification clean and set aside for service so you're cleaned up god gives you a new spirit he gives you a heart of flesh but he doesn't put his spirit in yet hello somebody he's waiting to see what you're going to do you say by the way god already knows what yeah he knows what you're gonna do but you don't unto obedience where does obedience come in why when i get the holy ghost i'm just no at sanctification you need to start being a bit obedient according to peter he ought to know he was not very obedient until he got the holy ghost he was cutting ears off cursing god running away from god going fishing right but when he got the holy ghost what was he first one out first one out the door and the first one to tell us we needed these virtues faith virtue and always temptation godliness brotherly kindness and love sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied brother brown says on the interval god prophesied through the prophet and said i will write my laws in their hearts where i put them in the tables of their hearts showing that that would be the dwelling place of god in the human heart not the human head everybody with me on that human heart not this thing it's something right here it's the heart of you the core of you what you think it's it's your attitude your aptitude your altitude i will write them in my heart and in their heart and they'll keep my statutes and so forth saith the lord god sent in another place over in ezekiel said i will in that day take out your old fleshly stony heart and i'll give you a new spirit and i'll put my spirit in you now a lot of people even you pentecostal people a lot of times get mistaken in that if we got some pentecostal ideas in here today let me just ask you that question even you pentecostal people a lot of times got mistaken on that you get a new spirit that's not god's spirit amen that's you that isn't god you get a little happy because you got a new spirit and you jump up and down run around the floor maybe shout a little bit speak with tongues run around a little bit and think you got the holy ghost that's not it that's not it that's a new spirit god gave you that's you then after he gives you your spirit then he said i'll put my spirit that's what's a matter with missed meal cramps you get today amen wow that's the reason you can't get nowhere with god that's what we're trying to do we're trying to get somewhere with god we're not trying to get somewhere with the world we're trying to get somewhere with god you see people out there in the world trying to build their own kingdom that's what that's in their mind that's what they want they want all the money they can get all the power all the authority all the rulership yes they're going to hell if they don't get the baptism by the holy ghost and on the day of judgment they're not going to stand any taller than the next person notice you put a new spirit god has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him you can't get along with yourself that old devil spirit you had in you preach it brother brown i'm going to say it so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit amen i'll put a new spirit in them and i will put my spirit in them and he said after he gives you a new spirit after he's given you a new spirit that's you don't get it confused with god's spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the holy ghost if he ever gives it to you if he ever gives it to you oh brother wait i was just before the foundation world yeah the mind of god you were in the mind of god you were an eternal seed but down here you were not you were born in sin shaped and iniquity the things i did god was not in my body when i was doing those things i was doing if everybody's okay with that can we say amen amen i knew i was lost i had a seed of representation i knew when the word came to me that i would respond and god knew that but you know what it was because i made a choice as long as you'll preach that seed with a choice i'll agree with you but you preach that seed with no choice you're wrong and i will put my spirit in them and he said after he give you a new spirit that why would he give you all this stuff if you already had it it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the holy spirit if he ever gives it to you amen because you and your condition never get along you can't get along with your wife how many people can say amen to that please don't say man y'all are not supposed to do that your wife's most of them sitting right here i can get along with mine she might not get along with me but i sure can get along with mine i can't get along without mine leave me for an older man her daddy let me make that clear her father you can't get along with your husband can't get along with your neighbor how you ever going to get along with god so he has to give you a new spirit before you can get along with him so he puts a new spirit in you and then he puts his spirit in you gives you a new spirit a new outlook a new faith then he puts his holy spirit in you that's what we're going to talk about just for a few minutes the baptism of the holy ghost i want us to every person i think it was maybe saint martin one that didn't that didn't didn't rest until he knew everybody in his congregation had the baptism of the holy ghost well we got a pretty good size congregation but i sure want every one of you to have the baptism of the holy ghost i want you to have the new birth not on your spirit i want you to have it in your soul so that you can respond to god amen that's my that's my my plea every time up before i walk out that door first peter 1 verse 42 says seeing you have purified your souls now you can't do it but god can't when he puts his soul inside of you that's god's soul perfect eternal can't sin yes that's what god's looking at let's get right with this thing that's what god's looking at he's looking at that he took uh his soul and put it inside of you not a second person not a third person i've said before we gotta start realizing that we're not part of god john's got that furrow and isn't it most people do that when i say that we're not a second person god is god satan wants to be like him satan wants to be him and without the new birth you and i can't be god but we're not a second person jesus prayed in saint john 17. he said god he said father i pray that they and me be one as the father and i are one how many were they one i don't want to be like god i want to be god amen by the baptism of the holy ghost my soul is god because if there's any party you left in there it's not done the work is not finished because he's going to judge your soul he's not going to judge your spirit he's going to judge your soul he's going to get right down in that center person and if there's anybody in there beside god brother john you're going to have to give account for your works please don't let me have to give account for my works let me give let me go up there and say oh i took you lord whatever he done put it on him didn't jesus say cast your burdens on me give it to me that's a problem we give it to him and go like i said before we go fishing in the sea of forgetfulness put a new fish inside there and leave it alone seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptible seed if you always was eternal why'd you need to be born again listen folks we were born wrong we had a we had an adamic nature we had a satanic nature if you don't get rid of that it becomes you and you vulcanize with satan just like brother brown said we vulcanize with god when we get the new birth when we get the new birth we vulcanize with god now when you vulcanize something i know brother john's about he's a little younger than i am but i can remember putting patches on tires especially my bicycle because we just poor folks back then and we had to patch our patches but what you do you heat it up you didn't go find a piece of wood or a feather you got another piece of what rubber you got a piece of god and you took that and by the baptism of the holy ghost and fire you had to put the fire to it oh you put the glue on there you know if you slap that patch on there you pump up and here's this big old ball of of uh like a balloon pops up why you didn't vulcanize it we got to vulcanize with god that's why i said we we can't be we we lean on the oneness that we're they're on this side we lean on the trinitarians and and we become the worst tunis it ever was it's me and god no it's god he decided you were going to be him he decided you were going to do these things and he wrote it in his bible but you have to start as a child of god just like each one of you had to start you have all your faculties everything you need except what except your growth except your development of your intelligence then you can drive a car abby's 15 now bless everybody's heart in banks county but she's going to be able to drive because what the law of the land says that she has come we're not going to talk about my grandbaby the law says that she has come to a place of maturity that now she can go to the next step and they give her a certificate if she passes the test always is a test always to have a testimony you gotta have a test first because one day what she's gonna do is she's gonna say i got my license well that's a testimony to her test and then her mom and daddy's gonna have a real test they did buy her hummer though so that's good either that or a tank they couldn't find an army tank so they got they got a hummer just don't hit anybody else but being born again not of corruptible seed but of the incred of incorruptible by what by the word of god you're not born again because your mama got born again or your daddy got born again or your pastor got born again you're born again by the incorruptible word of god you have to hear the word of god why does the seed have to come through the body why did why did paul have to go why did he have to go and find a nice i just got knocked off my horse and i believe this message no that ain't what happened paul actually got physically blinded and had to be led to the life i said life he saw the light but he had to be led to the life and nice pray for this guy lord you really he's killing us oh i got to work for him don't you worry about it why god was talking to one of his kids he was talking to his child a nice and paul was getting ready to come into the body everybody with me for all fleshes is grass and all the glory of man is the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower there'll fall us away just like our flesh but the word of god endureth forever and this is a word by the gospel that is preached unto you ephesians 1 verse 10 so that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth in other words he's there in here even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance remember i told you before brother brown told us he said he said jesus didn't come to bring us an inheritance think about that so that's where they'll get the furrow in their eyes if they hadn't heard it before brother mom tells us in the adoption series he said jesus didn't come to bring you in your heritage he said beg your pardon jesus didn't come to bring you an inheritance your inheritance was before the foundational world he just came here to get you a way back to it jesus never gave us an inheritance we already had an inheritance in the mind of god before the foundational world in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be the praise of his glory he first trusted in christ and whom he also trusted look after after you heard the word of truth you didn't trust them before you heard the word you trusted your own self you trusted them demons that was talking to you hello maybe y'all didn't come the same way i did some of y'all just looking at me kind of strange usually the devil looks at you kind of strange you'll get that in a minute too the gospel of your salvation how many times did brother ryan say oh i wish you could see the faces of the people now what it was those demons rising up out of those people it wasn't that he was just discerning this little black thing sitting on their shoulder he saw their reaction to what he was talking about but look in whom the gospel of your salvation whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance listen down payment down here then you've got seven payments you got to make seven payments which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory john 14 verse 15 says if you love me keep my commandments this is where i was getting to right here watch can you believe this and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that you may buy that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not see not not look at understand like i said we become aliens then again we become aliens of this world we're aliens of away from god without the new birth then we become aliens of the world because we don't have anything to do with them what is in all the movies that you see aliens come from another planet we can't understand them they look different praise god amen at least i'm not green but we do look different we act different there's a purity about the bride that the world don't even see that the world looks at us and goes you wear what you don't wear what you don't have a tv you do what on sunday two services oh my word i had a girl in my dentist office she said i'm leaving my church i said what you leaving church for that preacher preached over 15 minutes and i ain't gonna stand for it well my righteous indignation got up a little bit during that time they were working on my teeth but i told amy i said get that stuff out of my mouth i'm fixing to tell her something i said i looked at it i said lady i said if jesus christ can die on a cross and lay and hang on that cross for three hours for my sin i can go to church and listen to god what he's got to tell me 15 minutes won't get it done and i told her about that voice right there then amy stuck that thing back in my mouth that just gets me stirred up when people go well i want to be a christian but now 15 minutes is that grief i did i said i said lady if he hung there with nails and stripes naked in front of the world for three hours he hung there i said can't we sit and listen to the word of god for that allow mount the amount of time it never even phased her she just you know what there was nothing there i will not leave you comfortless i'll finish right here i will come to you yet a little while in the world see if me no more but you'll see me because i live you shall live also what we're going to see the alien god is an alien to this world ain't no doubt at that day hold on a minute at that day what you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i knew that's impossible to draw a picture of that but in my mind i can see that there stood god there stood father there stood jesus there stood the holy ghost and when i connect to that i'm standing inside that too we can't lose first corinthians 3 says in our brethren could not speak unto you as spiritual but as carnal even as the babes in christ it's okay to be a baby it's not okay to stay a baby i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet are you able now he's in corinth we know how they were for a year yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying strife division and you are not carnal and walking are you not carnal and walk as men first peter 2 verse 1 says therefore laying aside all malice all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes we gotta start as a baby and when you become a baby you are a little bit legalist you're in the news you're still in that spirit of do's and don'ts all right you look at people and you go then you have to you have to put some grace sam on it because without the grace they have you start running people off you know i told daddy many many times i said how you put up with these people he says they pay the bills as newborn babes desiring the sincere milk of the word that you may grow there by he's not talking about y'all we were talking about later on a long time i need to explain that he was talking a long time ago we were this was 20 years ago this is not today so some of you are still here from 20 years ago anyway let's can you forget what i just said brother joe take that piece off of the internet if so be you have tasted that the lord is gracious the air just went right out of the building john 14 verse 25 says these things have i spoken unto you yet being what present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things hallelujah and bring all things to your remembrance what revelation whatsoever i have said unto you now the greek lexicon tells that's paracletus and that's comforter advocate one who pleads your case before a judge he's a council for defense he's a legal assistant he's an advocate we can't lose go in the courtroom and and the guy that's every piece of the of the judicial system is one man and he's our daddy one who pleads another's calls with one an intercessor so of christ in his exaltation at god's right hand pleading with god the father for the pardon of our sins let's continue on down i want to get to something wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaketh by the spirit of god calleth jesus the curse now watch that's why that as we were talking when we first started there is a there is a teaching in the message that you've got to get all these virtues before you get the holy spirit because you see it up there at the top that's totally untrue totally untrue you can't have these virtues and not and and not be born again because that's the virtue of god that's not the virtue of man that's not something that your mom and dad gave you the genetics of your mom and dad that's the genetics of god so look no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost only way now let's get this real quick ii peter here's peter again simon peter servant apostle of jesus christ look to them that have obtained now he hasn't started in the virtues yet everybody with me he hasn't started in the virtues yet he said those that have obtained light precious faith with us all right so if peter had this kind of faith my finger because on the day of pentecost i believe he got born again and he said we've got to have that light precious faith so we've got to be born again before we can get these virtues with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of the god of jesus our lord look according as he as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertaineth unto what life and godliness these virtues will teach you how to raise your kids teach you how to okay well be i was gonna say something about the boss but it'll make you love your boss and people are groaning you love him and not like him let's get on to this according his divine power has given unto given unto what us all things that pertains unto life in godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us the glory and virtue we have given at us what exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature there's only one divine nature and that's the nature of almighty god everything else is filthy ranks amen but you can have that though by vulcanizing that together kill that old nature and let god have control you have escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust look and beside this so this is one thing and beside this besides verse one through four and besides this giving all diligence add amen add to your faith listen faith's not an ad face to birth it doesn't say add this to you it doesn't say no it says add to your faith so there's seven ads right amen we've been taught this before seven ads one two three four five six seven there's seven ads face not an ad face to birth and besides this giving all diligence ad everybody with me now let's look for just one second i will start on this this afternoon let's go to numbers 34 13 it says that moses commanded the children of israel saying this is the land which you shall inherit by lot now look this is moses talking to the children of israel now who placed them in the land though joshua placed them in the land is that all right but moses was the man of the hour to get them there everybody with me everybody see the allegory everybody see the parable that we're fixing to start here moses didn't get him in the promised land he got him to the promised land he gave him the laws he gave them the commandments he told them how to do this and how to do that but joshua was the one commissioned to take them in and brother brown said positionally place them in the land everybody with me all right this is the land which you shall inherit by lot which the lord commanded to give you unto the nine tribes and half tribes now remember i'm going to slow down just for a second there's 12 tribes of israel right for the tribe of the children of reuben according to the house of their fathers and the tribe of the children of gad according to the house of their fathers have received their inheritance and half the tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance the two tribes and a half have received their inheritance on this side jordan so if you're looking at a map we'll look at if you'll bring that map up near jericho eastward toward the sunrise so under moses there was 12 tribes of israel and they're going to bring it up here in just a second and this is a beautiful story everybody see that all right hold it right there no we got to whoa can you see that this is all the 12 tribes now now listen they're over here this is the jordan river this is the dead sea and that's the jordan river is everybody with me saying ma'am sea of galilee jordan river everybody with me this is the promised land this over here is where they coming out of the what they're coming out of the wilderness of sin they're coming out of coming out of sanctification everybody with me just for a minute then we'll close all right reuben and gad are cattlemen cattlemen a lot of grass over here so they say well look what we're going to do is moses to make this short what are we going to do moses is if you don't mind we would like to have this possession because of the cattle but what we're going to do is is we're going to go over jordan and we're going to help them fight to get their position they're back with me all right can y'all see that i'm talking about these over here okay so reuben gad and half tribal manasseh why a half tribe why not a full tribe because watch what happens they all go over and fight and then they come back this is their possession justification who's reuben reuben's the firstborn justification got to start somewhere sanctification i'm trying to hurry up the baptism of the holy ghost but what does the baptism of the holy ghost do it's got to continue over into the promised land to get your other half tribe everybody with me justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost because look you say oh brother wait that's the promised land no you're not you're not placed remember the holy ghost is different from the position the holy ghost is different from adoption this is the holy ghost this is adoption everybody with me over here this is adoption this is the placing of every one of them gets a certain spot but reuben again and half tribal manasseh said we're going to go over there and help you fight we're going to send the holy ghost over there to fight because without the holy ghost you can't find anyway so they're going to go over there and fight but they're going to come back here showing that the church ages sure they were in a promised land of their own but they never were in adoption they never were placed amen this is your life justification sanctification baptism holy ghost you can stay here if you want to but the holy ghost is over here compelling you to come on across because there's a man named joshua over here that's going to positionally place you where you need to go on that side jordan on the east side of jordan that's where the virtues must be in you let's read this right here the virtues must be in us watch this then when we get true virtue we can add it to our faith that's the next foundation wall now first you must have faith faith alone won't do it oh i got brother wait i got faith yeah you got faith you're right you got baby faith but you still need a mom and a daddy you still need to take the test to get to drive to drive the car faithful everybody still believe brother was a prophet i hope you all didn't leave and come back all right faith alone won't do it you've got to what add virtue to your faith you must have virtue in order to add it to your faith and we'll get started that not not this afternoon we'll get started on something else but that i just want to give you a little snippet of that that we're going to uh get to but i love that with the uh with the um justification about justice thank you baptism the holy ghost that takes you into the promised land without these three you can't get in it's a connection that's why the half tribe stayed out here and a half tribe was over here they were connected to each other but remember they went over and helped them fight but then they came back and settled and we'll read it this afternoon where brother brown talks about the church ages they were under revelation of the son of god not the son of man they didn't come to adoption they were not even they were not even under the mandate to come to adoption remember what i said what brother brown said he said they had just enough of the holy ghost to get saved heal the sick they can raise the dead do all these things but furthermore of the word is what we're talking about from now on the word is right here the listen these are all the children of israel they had to be the children of israel to even get any land so you got to get born again to even get in line to get any land but this is not all the land we want everybody else wanted some more they went on across jordan they died to themselves let's stand to our feet musicians don't have to come let's just sing let's just sing a little course or something um and then we'll be dismissed but we got to come to a place to where we want to go across even the ones that got anyone reuben again and east manassas they wanted to go across and help their brothers because that was the strength that came across the strength of the new birth will take you across but it's not going to give you everything in the land you got to fight for every inch of these virtues you got to fight for everything you need you got to fight every day you wake up and every day every night you go to bed when i wake up in the morning when i lay my head to rest i am blessed can you say that even those tribes that were on this side gad and reuben they realized there was green grass there and they had to grow cattle and that's why they took that side moses said but now you got to go over there and help them fight though that's what brother brown was talking about he was talking about the pentecostals and all the different ones okay you got the holy ghost what are you gonna do about it he kept compelling the pentecostals pentecostal yeah we got the new birth yeah we're just gonna lay down right here and cabbage down on this and this is it speaking in tongues is it but it doesn't matter how we live we cannot i don't have to have any virtue we don't have to have any knowledge temperance patience godliness they probably preached on it but you know what they had nobody to take them there you and i have somebody to take us there we have a moses that brought a message but what as i was with moses joshua as i was with the prophet william branham people bride i will be with you and i'm going to place you in the promised land by the holy ghost to a fivefold ministry that will take you into the promised land if you'll let them do that let's bow our heads thank you lord for
