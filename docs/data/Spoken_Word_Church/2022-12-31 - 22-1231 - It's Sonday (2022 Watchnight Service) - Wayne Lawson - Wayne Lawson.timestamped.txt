[11:55] You Are Holy Holy Holy
[12:02] Holy Holy Holy
[12:05] I want to see you
[12:12] amen amen God bless you all tonight
[12:16] it's a real honor to be here and we
[12:18] trust that you've come to a man to
[12:21] Worship the Lord and to entertain the
[12:24] presence of the Angel of the Lord
[12:26] let him come by your way and amen it's
[12:29] certainly good to see this God family
[12:30] and brother and sister Tatum and God
[12:33] bless you folks amen there
[12:35] good friends and we certainly have been
[12:38] blessed through the years with her
[12:39] friendship and you know um I don't
[12:42] usually mention things like this but
[12:43] middle of that covet it a little tough
[12:45] on the Evangelist you know that was just
[12:48] almost complete traveling I hadn't heard
[12:49] from Brother Ed in almost a year went
[12:51] out to the mailbox one day and there was
[12:53] something from them and tell me that he
[12:55] was praying for us and this one to help
[12:57] us get through those times and and uh we
[13:00] certainly appreciate what they've done
[13:02] and say God bless you and amen to all of
[13:04] you and and our friends here brother uh
[13:08] our sister Colin someone told me we've
[13:10] got to be here tonight with us and we
[13:12] want to say God bless you sis it's been
[13:14] a few years since we saw you all and
[13:16] amen we trust the lord to bless you
[13:19] tonight in a special way and amen to be
[13:22] able to be here and be a part of the
[13:24] meeting see you all come out together it
[13:25] sure blesses our heart uh Brother Sam
[13:28] God bless you and thank you for the open
[13:30] door to be here tonight and Amen brother
[13:32] Wade and his family I just want to say
[13:34] that it's it's an honor to speak to what
[13:37] I believe is the cream of the crop
[13:40] the Bride of Jesus Christ I I think it's
[13:43] the greatest privilege that a man could
[13:45] ever be given
[13:46] and brother random said it he said you
[13:49] know he said if we had a charger of the
[13:51] blood of Jesus he said how we would
[13:53] handle it he said but God gave that
[13:56] blood to purchase this people
[13:59] so this people is more precious to God
[14:01] than his own blood
[14:03] so I think we ought to think about the
[14:06] preciousness and the value that God has
[14:08] placed into you and amen and uh so it is
[14:11] a tremendous time last night to speak
[14:13] with you and if you're first time being
[14:15] here tonight we say God bless you and uh
[14:18] and we're just going to go into a few
[14:20] things here that's on our heart and it
[14:21] would be okay if I just kind of relax
[14:23] and preach to you a little while and and
[14:25] let the Holy Spirit lead us down some
[14:28] paths and amen there's some things on
[14:30] our heart and so I just want to maybe
[14:32] take a few minutes in it this is a
[14:35] Saturday night so I don't want you to
[14:37] think that I'm that I'm confused on what
[14:39] day it is but I want to preach to you
[14:41] tonight
[14:42] a little thought that I had been on uh
[14:45] it's Sunday again uh for about three or
[14:48] four Sundays I walked in our church and
[14:50] said it's Sunday again and so everybody
[14:52] got got to laughing at me because it's
[14:54] Sunday again but you know I'm not
[14:56] actually talking about s-u-n-d-y I'm
[15:00] talking about
[15:00] s-o-n-d-a-y it's Sunday again let's go
[15:03] into the Bible tonight hey man we're
[15:05] going to go into Mark the 16th chapter
[15:08] uh
[15:10] if you have your Bibles on
[15:13] sometimes I like to do this and please
[15:15] don't think I'm superstitious but I like
[15:17] to open the Bible and then pray
[15:19] I like to pray about that open word amen
[15:23] let's just bow our hearts now gracious
[15:26] father we thank you tonight
[15:28] for the word that has been opened and
[15:30] Lord we open the pages of the Bible
[15:33] but Lord it would take you to open the
[15:36] content
[15:37] to break the scripture Lord to your
[15:39] children
[15:40] and Lord
[15:42] late in the evening on the third day
[15:44] you took two aside and the Bible said
[15:47] you broke the bread Lord and they
[15:49] recognized it was you
[15:52] and Lord when they went to tell their
[15:53] friends
[15:54] about meeting you the Bible said you
[15:57] appeared again among them
[16:00] and Lord day was left with a message
[16:02] that you would meet with them
[16:05] and Lord here we are today in this hour
[16:08] where a prophet has been told by the
[16:10] angel of the Lord I'll meet you in there
[16:13] and Lord we know this is the meeting
[16:15] place when your word begins to open to
[16:18] the heart of your children that's where
[16:19] you meet them
[16:20] then I ask you tonight as we invite you
[16:23] into this place on this Saturday evening
[16:25] the last evening of a calendar year
[16:28] Lord I ask you that your mercy would
[16:30] just come into this building may you
[16:32] take a may you take a mind of a man and
[16:34] may you set it aside and may you take
[16:37] the gift which you've deposited and use
[16:39] it Lord For Your Glory
[16:41] I ask you that the Holy Ghost would just
[16:44] come in this room tonight and speak to
[16:46] the need of your children
[16:47] father that Supernatural words would be
[16:50] spoken to your people and father as we
[16:52] would charge the enemy to back away from
[16:55] your children I pray father the Holy
[16:57] Spirit would come and it would bind the
[16:59] Brokenhearted Lord it would Open the
[17:01] Eyes Lord of the Blind and I asked your
[17:04] father that your mercy would just take
[17:06] the room now as we commit this meeting
[17:09] into thy faithful hands in the name of
[17:11] Jesus Christ we pray amen
[17:14] and amen and God bless you and we want
[17:17] to look and mark the 16th chapter if we
[17:20] can
[17:21] and I want to read here uh from March 16
[17:24] and verse 2.
[17:28] Mark 16 and verse 2. and very early in
[17:32] the morning the first day of the week
[17:34] there came under the Sepulcher at the
[17:37] rising of the sun now these will be the
[17:40] texts brother Branham used for the
[17:41] message the rising the Sun but if you
[17:43] notice it says very early in the morning
[17:45] the first day of the week until about
[17:47] 321 A.D
[17:49] what we call Sunday now was known as the
[17:53] first day of the week but then
[17:55] Constantine gave it the name Sunday
[17:58] which it was a Roman word Sunday all
[18:01] right now if we go to Romans the eighth
[18:04] chapter
[18:05] in the 11th verse
[18:07] brother Brown's going to use this in uh
[18:10] also he uses Revelations 1 18. we'll not
[18:13] go there tonight but he it's a powerful
[18:15] scripture but Romans 8 and verse 11.
[18:19] but if the spirit of him
[18:22] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[18:24] dwelling you
[18:26] he that raised Christ from the dead
[18:30] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies
[18:35] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[18:38] Romans 8 and 11. now if we go to Luke 17
[18:41] and 30.
[18:44] for even thus shall it be in the day
[18:49] when the son of man is revealed and the
[18:52] day when the son of man is revealed God
[18:55] bless you you can be seated tonight
[18:58] we want to speak to you concerning this
[19:01] scripture
[19:03] it's Sunday again
[19:06] and in saying that I know that the
[19:10] prophet will actually speak to us the
[19:13] Church of the Living God from the
[19:14] message of rising of the son and in this
[19:17] rising of the sun brother Brandon was
[19:19] speaking to us about quickening power
[19:21] he's talking about what it causes to
[19:24] make us alive what what would what would
[19:26] resurrect us or make us alive and in
[19:29] doing so brother Branham was uh he he
[19:32] he's uh he's a powerful preacher and he
[19:35] has a way of saying things that are so
[19:37] simple that most of the time the average
[19:40] person will look over it and think well
[19:42] there's nothing to it but then if you go
[19:44] back and you just saturate it and listen
[19:46] to it and watch it it has something in
[19:49] it that is very much concerning the
[19:52] church now uh if you're if you're
[19:55] reading and and follow along with
[19:56] brother Brandon of course
[19:58] my brother by Adam will take us and uh
[20:01] and I'll skip the first part of the rise
[20:02] of the sun where he talks about uh what
[20:04] the power of the Sun the seeds and
[20:06] things but it he comes to a certain
[20:08] point and that he begins to read the
[20:11] scripture concerning the first fruits of
[20:14] the Book of Leviticus and brother man
[20:16] said I have a scripture here that I
[20:17] think uh he said I'd like to you to turn
[20:20] there and I wrote it down he said I
[20:21] think it might help you a little bit I
[20:24] found it in the Book of Leviticus if you
[20:25] want to turn Leviticus 23 and 9. amen uh
[20:28] he said now listen close in the
[20:30] levitical law God is speaking to Moses
[20:33] saying and all these things are a type
[20:35] now and we'll stop here for a moment in
[20:37] this type so brother Brahm is reading
[20:39] this Leviticus 23 9-11 and he's re he's
[20:43] reading it for a type now if let's read
[20:46] it together and the Lord spake unto
[20:48] Moses saying Speak unto the children of
[20:51] Israel saying unto them when you come
[20:53] into the land which I give you and you
[20:56] shall reap the Harvest thereof of then
[20:59] you shall bring a she for the first
[21:01] fruits of your Harvest unto the priest
[21:03] and he shall wave the Sheep before the
[21:05] Lord to be accepted now watch the
[21:07] scripture on the morrow after the
[21:10] Sabbath the priest shall wave it so it's
[21:12] on the first day the priest shall wave
[21:14] it so he's getting into a levitical law
[21:17] where Moses is talking about
[21:20] that the children of Israel was going to
[21:23] come into a place or under a land and
[21:25] brother Branham is saying that it's a
[21:26] tide in other words they're going to
[21:27] come into a Promised Land I'm going to
[21:29] read paragraph 82 and brother bam says
[21:31] of course he says see unto the place and
[21:34] brother bam is going to replace the word
[21:36] he said unto a place or unto a position
[21:39] that I have given unto you now you speak
[21:42] to the children of Israel that when you
[21:44] get to this certain place that I have
[21:47] promised you that I take you to when you
[21:49] get there in that land now speaking
[21:52] natural here but it's typing the
[21:54] spiritual and you shall reap the Harvest
[21:57] thereof that's the scripture he said
[21:59] when you get to this place and you shall
[22:01] reap the Harvest thereof but brother
[22:03] random says it like this you have
[22:04] received what I have told you in that
[22:07] place in other words God said you're
[22:09] going to go into a place but then you're
[22:11] going to receive something in that place
[22:13] and when you get there and you receive
[22:15] that then you should bring a Sheaf of
[22:17] the first fruits of your Harvest unto
[22:19] the priest and he shall wave it before
[22:21] the Lord to be accepted tomorrow after
[22:24] the Sabbath now of course when brother
[22:26] Branham speaks of this he tells us in
[22:28] the adoption he tells us that we are not
[22:30] going to a natural land but we're going
[22:33] to a spiritual land so the Church of the
[22:35] Living God like Moses brought them out
[22:38] of Egypt and then God LED them into a
[22:40] land Moses told them on the way you're
[22:43] going to a certain place and when you
[22:45] get into that place it'll be a land and
[22:47] there's certain things that will be
[22:48] there and brother random is saying now
[22:50] God has given the church a land and then
[22:53] when you get in that land there will be
[22:55] things in that land and when you reap
[22:58] the Harvest or you get the things that I
[23:01] told you was going to be there then
[23:02] you're going to give us a sheath waving
[23:05] and it will be on the first day of the
[23:08] week now this promise has been given to
[23:10] the church it's a spiritual promise
[23:12] that's why uh that you know if you think
[23:14] about Israel a lot of people will say
[23:16] well Israel is a Promised Land it was
[23:19] because God promised them the land
[23:20] that's that's why it's a Promised Land
[23:22] because God promised them he promised
[23:25] Abraham you can have this land and the
[23:27] reason that the spiritual land of the
[23:29] church is considered a promised land is
[23:32] because God made the promise that we
[23:34] could come to this place or this
[23:36] position in other words we have been
[23:38] predestinated unto a certain position
[23:40] that God has made us now of course in
[23:43] Joshua chapter 6 you see that it was God
[23:45] that told Joshua that he had given him
[23:48] this land now if you if you studied the
[23:50] Book of Joshua of course it came to a
[23:52] certain point that after the death of
[23:54] Moses then therefore he said arise and
[23:57] go over this Jordan and all of his
[24:00] people under the land which I did give
[24:02] them even to the children of Israel so
[24:04] there come a point in the journey where
[24:07] they were no longer coming out they were
[24:09] no longer journeying they were no longer
[24:12] in the wilderness they were no longer in
[24:14] the land of that they were they were
[24:16] living but what they were living in
[24:17] didn't belong to them they couldn't
[24:19] build permanent dwellings they couldn't
[24:21] build Vineyards they couldn't dig Wells
[24:23] they couldn't claim the property they
[24:26] were because none of it belonged to them
[24:28] they were only journeying through amen
[24:31] but then God finally told them you need
[24:34] to arise and go into this land that I
[24:37] have given thee now when God got ready
[24:39] for them to go in that land it was a it
[24:42] was this it was a certain season now I
[24:44] think it's powerful to acknowledge that
[24:46] God has seasons and in the seasons of
[24:50] God when he tells you to go a certain
[24:53] way or do a certain thing God is God
[24:56] enough to back that up and make a way
[24:58] where there just is no way for you to
[25:01] enter into the place that he told you
[25:03] could go amen when God got ready to send
[25:05] Joshua over brother bam said it looked
[25:07] like he would have seen him at a
[25:08] different time but he sent him in the
[25:10] spring of the year and when he sent him
[25:13] over brother says the Bible of course
[25:15] says that the Jordan was overflowing
[25:17] during that time would have looked like
[25:19] if he was going to cross a Jordan you
[25:21] would have done it at a better time but
[25:22] see God chooses impossible times to
[25:25] prove that he is a God who can rule the
[25:29] impossible situation and make it
[25:31] possible that it would take a
[25:33] supernatural experience to get where
[25:36] they were going it was because God was
[25:38] doing the leading and you know when they
[25:40] come up to the Jordan of course in the
[25:43] latter rains we're falling right we're
[25:44] talking about the harvest season we're
[25:46] talking about the spring of the year so
[25:48] the Jordan was full of the latter rain
[25:51] amen the rain falling and and as it
[25:54] falls how many ever been around the
[25:55] mountains when it rains in the mountains
[25:57] it melts the snow and the rivers run
[26:00] full with snow belts so you had a double
[26:02] thing going you had the rains falling
[26:05] the latter rain the Harvest rain falling
[26:07] on the snow and it was filling up the
[26:09] rivers and the and the thing was running
[26:11] full and that's the time God decides
[26:14] that Joshua was going to go over the
[26:16] river but see it doesn't matter whether
[26:18] we think it's a good idea or not but
[26:21] when God says get up and go over this
[26:23] land you can get up and go into that
[26:25] land and God was sending them into that
[26:27] land now the Bible tells us how they
[26:29] were going to do it of course they were
[26:31] getting ready to go and God told them to
[26:33] tell the to tell the Levites put the
[26:35] word on your put the word upon your
[26:37] shoulders and just begin to go over this
[26:39] land now would you get to the place that
[26:41] you come up to that River the Bible
[26:43] tells us that when the priests put their
[26:45] foot in the river amen that the Bible
[26:48] Bible says that the waters parted and it
[26:51] went into dry land and God was able then
[26:54] see to open up a place to go into
[26:57] something he had made a promise to them
[26:59] amen I hate to stop for a minute but is
[27:02] this my cutting in and out there or is
[27:04] it just in my ear
[27:05] it's just in my ears it's steady out
[27:07] there okay amen I've got a I've got an
[27:09] in and out in and out of whoever's on
[27:11] the sound it's it's clipping a lot so I
[27:13] don't know if you need to run the
[27:14] scanner or what but you see what it is
[27:16] is this God allows them to go through
[27:19] that promised land and as they as they
[27:21] enter in there it was in a supernatural
[27:23] time but God see wanted to Mark the
[27:27] season they were going in so he actually
[27:29] tells Joshua to Market in other words
[27:31] don't just let this happen but I want to
[27:34] I want to make a memorial of of the
[27:37] passing at this time so that he commands
[27:40] them to stack the stones and you know
[27:41] the story amen that he was able to stack
[27:43] the stones now if you're if you're a
[27:45] Bible reader there was actually two
[27:47] different Stacks there was a stack that
[27:49] was on the bank and then there was a
[27:50] stack in the river because he wanted
[27:52] them the stack Stones exactly where the
[27:55] priest had stood where the waters were
[27:57] supposed to be but they were there no
[27:59] longer so those stones were stones of
[28:01] Memorial of their Crossing so if you
[28:04] were walking with your son years later
[28:06] and you sing the top of a pile of stone
[28:08] somebody said what's in Stones piled in
[28:10] the river well that was where the
[28:11] priesthood how did the priest stand
[28:13] there well see God opened up the river
[28:15] right here in this part but if the river
[28:18] was high there was a pile of stones that
[28:19] was on the land over Neil gergow and the
[28:22] Bible tells us that they were there for
[28:24] a memorial so they could always see the
[28:26] stones now it's a powerful thing to me
[28:28] because I I I I you know if you read the
[28:31] history we actually been right there
[28:33] where those stones were stacked but they
[28:35] believed that's the very same place that
[28:38] John the Baptist baptized Jesus and of
[28:41] course when Jesus was being baptized
[28:42] y'all remember John sermon he said God's
[28:45] able these stones to rise children unto
[28:47] Abraham so he was there proving that the
[28:50] supernatural God is able to do things
[28:52] Amen in impossible situations he's able
[28:55] to raise people amen who were not people
[28:58] but it should make them the people of
[29:00] God God is able to take someone amen and
[29:03] raise them up to fulfill the problem
[29:05] promises that he has made for a certain
[29:08] generation of course in 12 Stones laid
[29:10] there in gilgal and it was a place of
[29:13] the crossing and the times now it's a
[29:15] it's a powerful uh significant thing to
[29:18] me to recognize the season that they
[29:21] crossed over and in Joshua chapter 4 and
[29:23] verse 19 it actually records that it was
[29:26] the tenth day of the first month and
[29:28] they encamped in gilgal I think it's
[29:30] powerful amen The Crossing happens in
[29:32] the tenth in the in the in the 10th day
[29:35] of the first month now if your study the
[29:37] Passover you know Israel's calendar amen
[29:40] it starts in in the in the first month
[29:42] but the first month is actually the
[29:44] Passover or the Easter time and the in
[29:48] the seventh month is actually September
[29:50] september-ish amen but it's it's a it's
[29:53] built off of the moons so when they say
[29:55] the the fifth day of the first month
[29:58] it's in the spring of the year and the
[30:00] Passover season amen now it's a powerful
[30:03] thing to me that that God chose this
[30:06] same time to bring them into the promise
[30:09] as when he brought them out in The
[30:11] Exodus under Moses remember Exodus
[30:14] chapter 12 when Moses went down to
[30:17] deliver the children of Israel out of
[30:18] Egypt amen if the Bible records that
[30:21] they was to do a Passover and when they
[30:24] were going to have a Passover it was to
[30:25] be done on the 10th day of the first
[30:28] month amen and so they were they were
[30:31] coming into Passover now you all know
[30:32] the word Passover amen is that God was
[30:35] going to pass through Egypt and he was
[30:38] going to execute judgment upon the gods
[30:40] of Egypt amen I know y'all probably all
[30:43] studied this out good but it's a
[30:44] powerful study amen that there's there's
[30:47] ten different major deities that was in
[30:49] Egypt during that time so when God began
[30:52] to exercise a power over Egypt that God
[30:56] was exercising power over every deity
[30:58] that they had to show he was the god
[31:01] that could exercise judgment over the
[31:04] deities of Egypt up show us that they
[31:07] would realize there's only one true God
[31:09] and that was the god of Israel this
[31:11] unseen God and he had great power with
[31:14] him and and we find out that God was
[31:16] going to execute judgment he said but
[31:18] but he sent Moses in there to tell the
[31:21] people amen that if you will put blood
[31:23] on your door y'all know that token amen
[31:26] you put that blood on that door that I
[31:28] will pass over your house but I'm going
[31:31] to pass through Egypt and I thank God
[31:33] tonight for the Passover
[31:35] that that was a lamb brother man said
[31:37] they kept it up 14 days before they
[31:40] could show us but he said there's your
[31:41] ages right there that 14 days watching
[31:43] that lamb but sooner or later amen you
[31:46] couldn't use the lamb you had to use the
[31:48] life of the Lamb is that right look at
[31:51] the mystery laying there amen when the
[31:53] death angel come unto the last plague
[31:55] which was spiritual death and brother
[31:57] Brown said that's the last pledge
[31:59] striking the church spiritual death amen
[32:02] but when that plague came they didn't
[32:04] have the lamb they had the life of the
[32:07] Lamb which was displayed in the blood it
[32:09] was the token the Corporal body was hid
[32:12] in the house but the life was displayed
[32:15] amen showing us that in the season we're
[32:18] living in that the Corporal body of
[32:21] Jesus would be in the heavens but the
[32:23] literal life of the blood the baptism of
[32:26] the spirit would be back upon the church
[32:28] amen that would protect us from the
[32:31] death plague that was falling upon Egypt
[32:34] during that time amen it was a beautiful
[32:36] time and anybody that's ever read Exodus
[32:38] chapter 12 if you've ever listened to a
[32:40] many theological ideas or you study any
[32:43] in the in the circular Realms
[32:44] everybody's always talking about New
[32:46] Beginnings New Beginnings well New
[32:48] Beginnings just pass over amen and the
[32:50] reason is because God spoke to Moses in
[32:54] Exodus 12 and he said when God began to
[32:57] speak to him he said let it be a
[32:58] beginning of months unto you in other
[33:00] words that God could come in the middle
[33:02] of the year and say the first month just
[33:05] started God can come whenever God speaks
[33:08] to a man things start over again Hey
[33:11] listen God can start right in the middle
[33:13] of situations and start things over
[33:15] again I know I know what I'm talking
[33:17] about he said well God can't take God
[33:19] can't change things but every time you
[33:21] write a check every time you you sign a
[33:24] name and date it the date you write down
[33:27] you write 2022 or now it's going to be
[33:30] 2023 and why is it 2022 or 23 it's after
[33:35] the death of Christ and it's before the
[33:37] death of Christ so he he is a
[33:40] dispensational motion that breaks up the
[33:43] channels of time of how you count time
[33:45] it's before and after Christ and you see
[33:48] your life amen that's it before Christ
[33:50] and there's an after Christ and when God
[33:53] comes into a life it brings a new
[33:55] beginning into that life and I thank God
[33:57] tonight that there's a memorial a new
[34:00] beginning of coming out and there's a
[34:02] beginning of going in amen look what God
[34:04] done to that new generation when he took
[34:06] him over in the Book of Joshua he
[34:09] recircumcised the entire generation that
[34:12] was born during that time I pray we get
[34:14] the knives out again and circumcise the
[34:16] children of God and the power of the
[34:19] Holy Ghost can return in the church and
[34:21] the and the reproach of Egypt will be
[34:23] rolled off of our young people amen that
[34:25] the power of God can reveal the church
[34:28] with anointing and Truth Amen to bring
[34:31] this generation to everything that God
[34:33] has promised them to become to I I think
[34:36] it's powerful there can be a new
[34:37] beginning I mean I I let me shock you I
[34:40] don't believe in second chances
[34:43] I don't believe in second chances
[34:44] somebody said well he don't believe in
[34:45] second chances no I don't I believe in
[34:48] third chances and four chances and fifth
[34:50] tenses and six changes and seven chains
[34:52] I believe no matter what chance number
[34:55] you're counting when God gets ready to
[34:57] change the matter he can change it in
[35:00] the moment he can change it and live in
[35:02] the very time you say how can God do it
[35:04] I'll tell you how he done it he took a
[35:06] lamb and if you got the lamb that I got
[35:08] Christ is my Passover Lamb and his blood
[35:12] has the power to change your life or
[35:15] your situation it don't matter how dirty
[35:17] listen I tell you what I've got I've got
[35:19] the Fuller soap I've got a blood that
[35:22] can clean the fatherless Center I've got
[35:24] a blood that can clean up any life I got
[35:27] a blood that can change any man he can
[35:29] clean up a dope attic he can clean up an
[35:31] alcoholic he can take anybody and change
[35:34] them listen I'm a witness tonight he can
[35:36] take a man that's lost and undone and
[35:39] fill him with the Holy Ghost and put him
[35:41] in a platform to preach the gospel
[35:43] possible of Jesus Christ as a testimony
[35:46] that he can raise a man up because God
[35:49] is able these stones to rise
[35:52] children under Abraham I'm talking about
[35:54] a real God I'm not talking about a
[35:56] second-handed God I'm not talking about
[35:57] the third God of some Trinity I'm
[36:00] talking about the God that created the
[36:02] heavens and the Earth had come right
[36:04] down into a life and give a man A New
[36:06] Beginning have you ever wanted to start
[36:08] over well let me tell you what a man can
[36:11] start over with God
[36:13] yes sir I believe it I believe a man can
[36:17] start over with God somebody said well
[36:19] brother Wayne hey man I don't I don't
[36:20] know about that stuff let me tell you
[36:22] why amen you all know that's barley
[36:24] Harvest amen scripturally that's barley
[36:27] Harvest amen that's barley Harvest and
[36:29] if you're reading your Bible that's
[36:31] exactly when Ruth came in Amen to
[36:34] Jerusalem Ruth came excuse me to
[36:37] Bethlehem when Ruth came into Bethlehem
[36:39] it was in the season of barley Harvest
[36:42] it was the Passover season it was a
[36:45] season of new beginnings she was an
[36:47] idolatrous she was worshiping Heathen
[36:50] Gods amen but her old husband died and
[36:53] God was going to give her a new husband
[36:55] to bring forth the seed of the Triumph
[36:57] of Judah and God had a season to bring
[37:00] him in and God's got a season for you
[37:02] and God's got a season for your children
[37:04] and I say this is the season God is
[37:08] marked the season he spoke to a prophet
[37:11] sent him among the church he preached a
[37:13] token message and he changed the
[37:16] dispensation
[37:18] oh brother let me tell you what the
[37:19] prophet of God said from this time and
[37:21] this time forward he said They Crucified
[37:23] the word and they're no longer a place
[37:25] of worship and When They Crucified the
[37:27] word he said from this time it's the
[37:30] word and the word only I do not have to
[37:32] humble myself to denominations I don't
[37:34] hear to hear what the domination thinks
[37:36] about me whatever a prophet said is
[37:39] exactly what God has for us in this hour
[37:42] we are under a prophetic word the
[37:45] dispensation of God the time of new
[37:48] beginnings amen we didn't even have a
[37:50] Roman word Sunday but we had the first
[37:53] day of the week
[37:55] brother Madam tells us this he said that
[37:58] Sabbath day is the seventh day he said
[38:00] but which we call Sunday he said but a
[38:02] Roman word they call it Sunday Son of
[38:03] God but oh how it's changed it's not
[38:07] s-u-n anymore it's s-o-n-d-a-y something
[38:10] changed now something's changed what is
[38:12] it brother random tells us this he said
[38:15] see it's a change something changed the
[38:17] day of the week something moved us from
[38:19] Saturday to Sunday
[38:21] my goodness I don't know about y'all but
[38:23] you can't find eight days on a calendar
[38:27] you they ain't eight days on the count
[38:29] of people say to me how do you put eight
[38:30] days you can't find it on the calendar
[38:32] because it ain't on the calendar it's
[38:34] back to the first day again it's the
[38:37] first day of the week amen what is the
[38:40] rising of the Sun the prophet of God
[38:41] said it's the first corn of wheat that
[38:43] raised from the dead it was God's first
[38:45] Corner Wheaton by quickening power God
[38:47] quickened his life and raised him from
[38:49] the dead of the first fruits of those
[38:50] that slept he was the Sheaf and that's
[38:53] what had to wave as the she for it was
[38:55] the first one to come to maturity it was
[38:57] waived as a memorial or Thanksgiving to
[39:00] God it was a sign a believing that the
[39:02] rest of them would come he said preacher
[39:04] what are you talking about when they
[39:05] come in that land after Joshua after
[39:07] they crossed after they come into land
[39:08] do you know the first battle they fight
[39:10] is the walls of Jericho and they do it
[39:12] down at gilgal which is so close to the
[39:15] crossing but if you go back and study it
[39:18] before they fight the Battle of Jericho
[39:20] they have a feast and they eat of the
[39:23] Corn of the new land do you know what
[39:25] they were feeding on come on church
[39:27] under the under the Wilderness Journey
[39:29] there was a man of falling out of heaven
[39:31] but the Revival changed now and they're
[39:34] not following they're not feasting at a
[39:36] Man Out Of Heaven now they're eating out
[39:38] of the Corn of the land now I don't know
[39:40] some people say brother ain't what in
[39:42] the world are you talking about I tell
[39:43] you what I'm talking about amen we're
[39:45] not just feeding out of the church
[39:46] messages anymore amen this ain't just a
[39:49] this ain't just a passing time but God
[39:52] had promised us 2 000 years ago even
[39:55] 2600 years ago through Malachi that they
[39:58] would come into Elijah Ministry in the
[40:00] last day and restore the word of Truth
[40:02] John told us that God would reveal the
[40:05] mysteries of the entire Bible in this in
[40:08] the end times amen Daniel said the book
[40:10] would be opened up that God would reveal
[40:13] the word so you and I are not just
[40:15] feeding from Men's ideas about this
[40:18] Bible I hope you hear me tonight men
[40:21] have held this Bible for 2 000 years and
[40:23] they have told you what they believe it
[40:25] means but in the end time and the lamb
[40:28] took his own word and the lamb is
[40:30] declared what the Bible means we are not
[40:33] feasting on the church ages we are
[40:36] feasting on the word of the son of man
[40:38] that is coming to this age he said
[40:40] preacher what are you talking about I'm
[40:42] talking about feasting on the fruit
[40:45] of the message
[40:48] do you ever think about what Joshua ate
[40:50] before he met the angel of the Lord and
[40:51] took down the walls of Jericho something
[40:53] changed his attitude
[40:57] my goodness his diet changed
[41:01] into this battle changed
[41:04] have you ever thought about it he moved
[41:06] from a defensive battle to an offensive
[41:08] battle he moved from running from
[41:10] Egyptians to defeating the Jericho he it
[41:14] was a different battle amen amen we we
[41:16] had a new beginning it's a different
[41:18] land now we're not running because it
[41:21] said I'll tell a story how y'all gonna
[41:23] think I'm crazy me and Jewel me and Joe
[41:25] Farney got this in common amen I'm a
[41:27] security cat
[41:29] might as well tell you I'll just tell
[41:30] you up try I'm a scaredy cat when it
[41:32] turns dark I won't be in the house with
[41:33] a light on
[41:34] that was 40 year old before I let my
[41:36] wife shut the light out
[41:38] I was proud of myself when it finally
[41:40] happened
[41:42] I can sleep by myself in the hotel room
[41:45] these days you know
[41:46] you said preacher what are you talking
[41:48] about one ties in Albion Pennsylvania
[41:49] now now they don't believe me but it's
[41:51] the truth they got a haunted house up
[41:53] there
[41:55] it's haunted ain't it it's haunted
[41:57] people turn lights on all night dishes
[41:59] rattle in there stop move the last time
[42:02] that I was in that house the last time I
[42:05] was in that house I come home from a
[42:07] meeting and preaching for him I think it
[42:08] was a Wednesday night I walked in the
[42:10] bedroom and there's three lights about
[42:12] this big around swirling on the wall
[42:15] and I went over and I looked outside
[42:17] ain't nothing out there I met I looked
[42:20] around the room is there any reflection
[42:21] there ain't no reflection and I turned
[42:23] back and they're still there they're
[42:24] just swirling on the wall I've been in
[42:27] the presence of God a lot of times in my
[42:29] life that had nothing to do with my God
[42:32] you know what I did I told them Devils I
[42:34] said y'all give me five minutes I'm
[42:36] gonna pack my bags I'm gonna go this
[42:38] house don't belong to me you can have it
[42:42] you can have it
[42:45] and I packed my bags and I was in North
[42:48] Carolina by morning
[42:50] I said they can have it it don't belong
[42:52] to me but if I go to my house
[42:55] and them same Devils is on the wall it's
[42:57] a different thing brother I got
[42:59] grandbabies I got children amen it's a
[43:02] different attitude this is my house you
[43:04] gotta go amen and that's what happened
[43:07] to Joshua when he realized amen this is
[43:10] my land God gave it to me the walls have
[43:13] got to come down have you ever thought
[43:14] about why them walls came down really
[43:16] amen I would studying one day I thought
[43:18] it was powerful shirt and you don't have
[43:20] to take it if you don't like it but I
[43:21] liked it amen I was studied and found
[43:23] out that brother random said when the
[43:25] Jubilee trumpet sounded he said you had
[43:27] to come out of the walled cities he said
[43:29] because you couldn't redeem anything in
[43:31] the walled City it was actually a law if
[43:33] that walled city was built the houses
[43:35] couldn't be redeemed out of it so they
[43:38] had to come out of the walled City to be
[43:40] redeemed but you know when God sent
[43:42] Messengers into Rahab the Harlot you
[43:45] remember the walls were on the city so
[43:47] she couldn't come out under the Jubilee
[43:49] she couldn't come out under it but look
[43:52] at what God done he sent Joshua in there
[43:54] and walk down the walls of Jericho
[43:59] so God said if you can't come out of it
[44:01] I'll tear the wall down to get you out
[44:04] of it because she was the property of
[44:07] almighty God y'all know what y'all know
[44:09] why she was a property don't you she
[44:11] hung that red ribbon out of the wall I
[44:14] wonder where they got that Revelation I
[44:16] wonder where they figured out a token
[44:18] would separate amen a woman from the
[44:20] rest of the city they knew that God
[44:22] separated Israel from Egypt he could
[44:25] separate Israel's cattle from Egypt's
[44:27] cattle he could separate the firstborn
[44:29] from Egypt's firstborn it's God that
[44:32] done the separated and identified them
[44:34] and that same God identified Rahab and
[44:37] it was God's Property so God just tore
[44:39] the walls down let me tell you what
[44:41] you'll never do you'll never wall this
[44:43] bride up you'll never do it amen you can
[44:46] put her behind the wall but if she can't
[44:48] come out God will just tear the thing
[44:49] down and bring Grace into those lives
[44:52] hey man I tell you what God's going to
[44:54] come get his own
[44:56] and when these men come into that land
[44:58] and they found that corn God said I'll
[45:01] tell you what there's a memorial I want
[45:02] you to do I want you to wave a chief
[45:05] offering now I'm getting the chief
[45:06] waving tonight how many's heard the
[45:08] chief wavens
[45:09] raise your hand if you know the chief
[45:11] wave and see I don't have to cover it
[45:12] you know what I'm talking about amen
[45:14] that was a Sheaf waving to be waived he
[45:16] said that waving of that Sheaf Pro
[45:18] showed maturity had come
[45:21] put the seed in the ground the same
[45:24] thing come out of the ground showing
[45:26] God's process works
[45:28] God's process works death burial and
[45:31] Resurrection I can bury it it can die I
[45:34] can resurrect it and have the same thing
[45:36] that went down and it could come back
[45:38] again and when it returned in the
[45:40] resurrection God would make them wave it
[45:43] to the people what went down has come
[45:45] back again God has the power if you lay
[45:48] down the life he could raise it up again
[45:50] amen I'll tell you tonight that's
[45:53] exactly the Revelation that was laying
[45:55] there that when Christ went into the
[45:57] grave and he rose on the third day it
[45:59] wasn't somebody else come out of that
[46:01] grave it was that somebody else come out
[46:03] of there but Jesus was dead brother man
[46:06] said he was so dead remember that he
[46:08] said but when he come on the third day
[46:10] he had risen from the dead
[46:12] yeah
[46:14] that's why he had to be waived because
[46:17] he had returned exactly what went down
[46:20] had returned again I tell you it's a
[46:22] powerful thing but where it's real
[46:24] powerful is when brother Branham turns
[46:25] it to our day
[46:27] and he says now the same thing that went
[46:29] down in the book of Acts has got to
[46:31] return in the last day hey can I
[46:33] announce something to y'all the bride
[46:35] ain't coming she's here
[46:38] can I say something to you the alpha has
[46:41] become the Omega it's a declared word
[46:44] it's a definitive Revelation it don't
[46:47] need talked about and wondering whether
[46:50] it's true or not absolutely it's true
[46:52] whether you think about it whether you
[46:54] feel about that about yourself I tell
[46:56] you God said the alpha has become the
[46:58] Omega then I say the alpha
[47:00] has become the Omega
[47:04] so preacher what are you talking about
[47:05] I'll tell you wouldn't it be the master
[47:07] that tells you when the Masterpiece is
[47:09] done
[47:11] you'd think whatever you want to about
[47:13] the work but the one who designed it
[47:15] when he says it's finished
[47:17] it's finished
[47:19] I said preacher what are you saying
[47:21] brother Ram said Michelangelo hit the
[47:22] image he said and said speak he said
[47:25] that when he hollered speak it was a
[47:28] proof that it so matched his mind he
[47:30] thought it ought to talk
[47:32] and brother man said when the bride was
[47:34] smitten out of layout to see her he said
[47:37] see it was a sign that the church was
[47:40] finished
[47:41] come on church amen it was finished so
[47:44] no matter what you think about me a
[47:46] prophet of God says it's a perfect
[47:48] Masterpiece of the original image that
[47:51] God had in his mind God restored
[47:55] Michelangelo couldn't put the peace back
[47:57] but God put the peace back and now the
[48:00] Church of the Living God is exactly
[48:02] where it's supposed to be the word that
[48:04] went down is the same word that has
[48:06] returned brother Bynum didn't have to
[48:08] take one thing out of Jesus Christ to
[48:10] present him to you
[48:12] wouldn't it be something amen the same
[48:15] God that could cause the same Rose to
[48:18] return next year
[48:19] he's the same God that could cause
[48:21] Christ to return in the same form that
[48:23] it went down
[48:25] another prophet of God said when that
[48:27] happens it's got to be waived over the
[48:28] people now we know that the we know the
[48:30] chief waving we know that is Christ we
[48:33] recognize we're waving Christ over the
[48:35] people right it's Christ that was went
[48:37] down as Christ that returns we're waving
[48:40] Christ over the people but the thing
[48:42] about it is is Christ has to become
[48:43] flesh
[48:45] so people all the time asked me so well
[48:47] was the chief waving was it brother
[48:48] random or was it Christ it was both
[48:51] brother Brown said when I spoke them
[48:53] squirrels he said see he said God was
[48:56] using my lips
[48:58] see God had to have flesh God had to
[49:02] take on a body and show the maturity of
[49:05] the church before it could be a chief
[49:07] wave and he waved a sheep that the word
[49:10] again is waved over the people the Dead
[49:12] traditions the man is dead the Son of
[49:14] God is alive with the baptism of the
[49:16] spirit right Among Us given us life now
[49:19] y'all amen I just have to say this as
[49:21] clearly as I know how to say it William
[49:23] Branham was not a braggard
[49:26] there was a lot of things happen William
[49:28] Branham never told you about but why did
[49:30] he tell you about Hattie right
[49:32] why did he do it because it had to be
[49:34] waived over the people
[49:36] they had to know there was an anointing
[49:38] on the Earth
[49:39] come on Church a prophet went and told a
[49:42] little room about creating squirrels
[49:46] now I know everybody thinks they wish
[49:47] they could create squirrels but go ahead
[49:49] and tell the congregation you did it one
[49:50] time for me
[49:52] you think oh oh it'll make me a big guy
[49:55] no it'll make him look at you like
[49:56] you're crazy
[49:58] I've had Supernatural experiences happen
[50:00] and think man I can't wait to go tell
[50:03] somebody about it and when you start
[50:04] telling it you can see it in their eyes
[50:06] and you think I'll never mind
[50:08] just never mind
[50:10] never mind amen because all of a sudden
[50:13] either you're bragging on yourself or
[50:15] you're making it up that's the way
[50:16] people think that's right so can you
[50:18] imagine brother Branham telling the
[50:20] story of creating the squirrels and he
[50:22] said even a man was sitting there who
[50:24] had made something out of it he didn't
[50:26] he said and when he put it the way it
[50:29] was he said how do you write said to him
[50:31] brother Branham she said how did that
[50:34] happen he said Hattie all I can tell you
[50:37] is the same Jehovah Jireh that was over
[50:39] there with Abraham on that mountain it's
[50:42] the same Jehovah Jireh that produced
[50:44] that squirrel in those woods and she
[50:46] said it ain't nothing but the truth
[50:49] listen do you know what brother bam said
[50:51] about that he said there was a greater
[50:53] anointing came out then than when he
[50:55] created the squirrel
[50:57] I was a greater anointing when she
[51:00] agreed with a message than when it
[51:03] created the squirrel who said brother
[51:05] Wayne what are you trying to get out I'm
[51:07] saying that when this message was
[51:09] preached back there in the 1960s it was
[51:12] an anointing on it but when the Bride of
[51:15] the last days began to catch the
[51:17] revelation of this message there will be
[51:19] a greater anointing sweep this Earth and
[51:22] change our body in the moment in the
[51:24] twinkle of an eye the anointing of God
[51:27] is not for another day it's for this day
[51:29] it's for this hour it's for this time
[51:31] and when she recognized she was in The
[51:34] Presence of Jehovah Jireh she said it
[51:36] ain't nothing but the truth I tell you
[51:38] it's a powerful thing and brother Brown
[51:40] said he turned around and said to her
[51:41] now what do you have
[51:42] let's wave it hey man it can be done
[51:45] what will you get out of it come on what
[51:48] if he waved it what did it mean to you
[51:51] it meant you can too it meant that God
[51:54] has not just sent this for brother
[51:56] Branham he sent it for the church to be
[51:59] identified in the power of his word and
[52:03] look at what she done she claims my
[52:05] goodness too much too much too much amen
[52:07] you know what she did she claimed them
[52:09] children I'm gonna ask you why she did
[52:10] that what she'd been eating caused her
[52:13] to speak a certain thing
[52:15] brother random said she could have said
[52:17] give me a million dollars he said been
[52:19] on the table
[52:21] he could she could have said let my
[52:23] sister Edith walk and she would have got
[52:26] up and walked so she wasn't after a
[52:28] Prosperity Gospel and she wasn't just
[52:30] consumed with Divine Healing he said or
[52:32] she would have not thought it was a
[52:34] Revival when that Soul was saved but
[52:37] because she had been feeding from the
[52:39] Tree of Life the fruit that was in her
[52:42] mouth was the word of life and she said
[52:44] give me the life of them two boys listen
[52:46] I'll tell you what there's no greater
[52:48] Paradox there's no greater power upon
[52:51] the Earth and one that could change the
[52:54] soul of a mortal man from time element
[52:56] to Eternal from martial to immortality
[52:59] don't you water this message down just a
[53:03] Pentecostal idea amen this message is
[53:06] the power of God a Salvation that will
[53:09] change your life and a soul and a heart
[53:12] this message has power it has anointing
[53:15] it has truth it'll change lives it'll
[53:18] change bodies come on church if it will
[53:21] change your soul it'll change the way
[53:23] you live if it'll change your soul it'll
[53:25] change the way you dress it'll change
[53:27] the way you dress it'll change the way
[53:29] you talk it'll change the way you walk
[53:32] are you hearing me it didn't just
[53:34] Quicken the soul but it also quickened
[53:36] the body
[53:39] preacher what are you talking about I'm
[53:41] talking about the bride coming to Christ
[53:44] that's what I'm talking about in Rise of
[53:46] the stun the prophet of God said that
[53:47] Christ was the first one to raise from
[53:48] the prophets and so forth and type in
[53:50] many places he was the first fruits of
[53:52] them to slept and in the bride coming of
[53:54] Christ
[53:56] I've known a lot of people that don't
[53:58] want me to read that quote
[54:02] is it okay
[54:04] does that offend you
[54:06] in the bride coming of Christ
[54:10] I'll tell you what it don't offend that
[54:12] bribe but it will set that devil mad
[54:14] that's Satan's having a temper tantrum
[54:16] bubble man said let him have all the
[54:18] temper tantrum he wants to have he said
[54:20] because this bride is already glorified
[54:22] in the presence of God there ain't
[54:24] nothing the devil could tell God he
[54:26] didn't know about you that's why you
[54:28] need the blood that's why you need the
[54:30] power of God to answer the sin question
[54:33] that was upon your life but if God chose
[54:35] you for the job God provided a way to
[54:38] put you in the job to cleanse your life
[54:41] amen in the bride coming of Christ the
[54:43] coming out of the church they don't have
[54:45] to be a sheath wave so we've seen
[54:47] brother random women we've seen him wave
[54:48] it creation of squirrels spoken word
[54:51] over had his children we've seen him
[54:53] wave it a resurrection of a little fish
[54:55] the power of the spoken word to put a
[54:57] storm back what was he doing he was
[54:59] waving that the same one that had been
[55:01] on the earth two thousand years ago was
[55:04] not in Jerusalem he was back in the body
[55:07] of the Bride of Jesus Christ I challenge
[55:10] you to believe that the son of man is
[55:13] revealed in the form of the Bride in the
[55:16] last days I believe it with all my heart
[55:18] brother I meant I believe it with
[55:20] everything that's in me that there is a
[55:22] bride somewhere and it's been churches
[55:25] and churches and brides and Brides but
[55:27] there's got to come one that's kind of
[55:30] come one it's a vision that God has had
[55:32] of this generation
[55:35] you know I'm quoting a prophet I
[55:37] challenge you go look that one up amen
[55:39] what is it it's the bride coming of
[55:41] Christ on the last day it's the waving
[55:42] of a Sheaf I'm sure you see what I'm
[55:44] talking about it was waived over the
[55:46] people and for the first time they will
[55:48] come forth for a bright age for a
[55:51] resurrection out of dark
[55:52] denominationalism that will be a message
[55:55] the full maturity of the word has turned
[55:57] again into power and waved over the
[56:00] people
[56:01] my goodness to bring a resurrection in
[56:05] the bride
[56:06] this message is to resurrect the Bride
[56:10] come on church I'm not talking about
[56:12] just physical Resurrection I challenge
[56:14] you to listen to the rise of the sun
[56:15] William Branham was not talking about
[56:17] physical Resurrection the entire time
[56:20] he's talking about a spiritual
[56:21] Resurrection in the Church of course we
[56:24] believe the devil raise of course we
[56:26] believe there'll be immediate all
[56:28] believers believe that amen but a
[56:30] prophet was bringing the Revelation that
[56:33] there would be a spiritual Resurrection
[56:35] among the people
[56:37] that the same thing that was in the
[56:40] first of the Bible would be in the end
[56:42] of the Bible and the church would be
[56:44] restored to its original order and its
[56:47] original place a resurrection out of the
[56:49] dark nominationalism there'll be a bride
[56:51] hey man I'll tell you what you can
[56:52] preach a whole message right here a
[56:54] bride with a message now that's powerful
[56:58] I know they're trying to sit down our
[56:59] preachers but I say this for the first
[57:01] time preachers got something to preach
[57:05] I know it's Revival hour for the church
[57:07] but it's Revival for the devil too ain't
[57:09] it he's got new material
[57:13] he's trying to pervert this message but
[57:16] somebody's going to stay with it
[57:18] somebody's going to stay with it it's
[57:20] for a resurrection out of dark
[57:21] denomination you still got your Bibles

[57:51] resurrection that was what a
[57:53] resurrection this is and look you've got
[57:56] two resurrections you got a resurrection
[57:58] of Jesus you got a resurrection of the
[58:00] Bride now look at the power of this
[58:02] because there's two resurrections watch
[58:04] yet a little while the world seeth me no
[58:06] more but you shall see me because I live
[58:08] Resurrection number one ye shall live
[58:11] also Resurrection number two what a
[58:13] resurrection that was
[58:16] I live what a resurrection this is ye
[58:19] live
[58:20] he lives you live two resurrections
[58:23] Resurrection it was resurrection and it
[58:26] is so brother random is showing that he
[58:28] made us alive by the quickening power
[58:33] that's how we're alive we're alive by
[58:35] quickening power amen it changed us from
[58:39] denomination to the word
[58:42] I'm Gonna Stand rise of the Sun a minute
[58:44] paragraph 64 and because I live and ye
[58:47] live also and I live in you
[58:51] and the works that I do identify myself
[58:53] what a message no wonder we've had a
[58:55] dark world of theology but in the
[58:58] evening time there shall come alive now
[59:00] he's in Luke amen now he's over there in
[59:02] the book of Zechariah in that day Luke
[59:05] 17 in that day what day are we talking
[59:07] about Sunday in that day after the
[59:10] seventh the first day of the week again
[59:12] we'll go back to this same thing in the
[59:15] evening time there will come alive look
[59:17] it so Sunday is an evening message
[59:21] it's a powerful thought now the third
[59:24] day had a morning and an evening right
[59:26] in the morning was a rumor Pentecost
[59:28] he's alive in the evening was the proof
[59:31] of the Resurrection in the little room
[59:33] was it because I live you live also the
[59:35] works that I do will identify what a
[59:37] message no wonder we've had a dark world
[59:39] of theology
[59:40] but in the evening time there shall come
[59:42] light again there will be a resurrection
[59:45] in the evening time that it will be a
[59:47] resurrection there shall be light in the
[59:50] evening time you ever think about
[59:51] reading Zechariah in that day in the
[59:54] evening it shall be light in the evening
[59:56] it will be a resurrection
[59:59] see when it says shall be light y'all
[1:00:01] know that scripture's fulfilled right so
[1:00:04] you couldn't read it in the evening time
[1:00:06] scriptures will be fulfilled
[1:00:08] because God will bring a resurrection in
[1:00:11] the bride to Quicken them to the word
[1:00:13] that's supposed to be lived out in this
[1:00:16] day something has to make this word
[1:00:18] alive it is the quickening power of
[1:00:21] Jesus Christ Because He Lives amen My
[1:00:24] Redeemer Lives he's not dead that's him
[1:00:27] that's here manifesting the message in
[1:00:30] our generation William Branham proved
[1:00:33] that Jesus was not dead can I propose to
[1:00:35] you tonight that our lord Jesus is not
[1:00:38] in a grave
[1:00:39] could I propose to you that deities not
[1:00:42] even in heaven tonight but deity is in
[1:00:45] the Bride of Jesus Christ in your shoes
[1:00:48] tonight to fulfill the promised word of
[1:00:51] the hour you're living in it'll take God
[1:00:53] to do it amen what was it we was in a
[1:00:55] darkened world of unbelief we joined
[1:00:58] Methodist Baptist Pentecostals
[1:00:59] Presbyterians and there was still
[1:01:01] something wrong we just couldn't figure
[1:01:03] it out all of a sudden while we were
[1:01:06] groping in the darkness great
[1:01:07] Resurrection came to us in the
[1:01:09] manifestation of the promised word of
[1:01:11] God he brought light to us it brought
[1:01:15] light
[1:01:16] now the prophet of God tells us when
[1:01:18] that light comes of course what's it do
[1:01:20] amen light makes the darkness turn loose
[1:01:24] light you you plunge this room just shut
[1:01:27] all the lights off plunge it right into
[1:01:29] darkness
[1:01:30] turn the light on and the Darkness moves
[1:01:32] so light is more powerful than Darkness
[1:01:37] light has a supreme authority over
[1:01:40] Darkness this message has a supreme
[1:01:43] authority over every voice you've ever
[1:01:46] heard it has the power to cancel
[1:01:49] whatever the devil has spoke to you
[1:01:51] whatever the devil has said to your life
[1:01:54] Satan tries to claim you with the
[1:01:57] thought patterns of the denomination of
[1:01:58] the world but God said I'll bring
[1:02:00] another thing I'll bring lie to the
[1:02:03] evening time and when that light began
[1:02:05] to shine it killed every seed of
[1:02:07] denomination and it drove out the
[1:02:09] Darkness and Light began to shine and
[1:02:12] when light began to come into that place
[1:02:14] I'll tell you what it did when you come
[1:02:16] into that land you come into the on the
[1:02:18] first day when you're in that land the
[1:02:20] Sheaf will be waived it'll be back to
[1:02:22] that first day again be on brother
[1:02:24] Bradham says it in paragraph 109
[1:02:26] powerful amen I'll read one away I
[1:02:28] quoted it to you there's been churches
[1:02:30] churches Brides brides and Brides he
[1:02:32] said but there's got to be one
[1:02:34] Hallelujah to become a real bride
[1:02:37] right
[1:02:38] so there's impersonation bride which is
[1:02:40] real bride
[1:02:42] somebody said well I a lot of people
[1:02:43] claim to be the bride I don't care what
[1:02:45] they claim to be there's a real one
[1:02:46] somewhere
[1:02:47] there's a real one because God said it
[1:02:49] would be there he said now watch this
[1:02:51] there's got to come a real bride now
[1:02:54] watch he must identify the real bride
[1:02:56] there must come one that's not only got
[1:02:59] the mechanics
[1:03:00] we've got to be real careful with this
[1:03:01] as message preachers as message people I
[1:03:04] personally lean to studying you're
[1:03:06] listening to me preaching you hear it
[1:03:07] don't you I I I I just saturate myself
[1:03:11] in it I I literally lay in the quotes in
[1:03:14] the scripture and how do they time which
[1:03:16] way do they go it's where my joy is it's
[1:03:19] where I it's where I really find
[1:03:21] strength and energy and I enjoy it so
[1:03:23] there's a mechanics of the word of God
[1:03:25] and how it operates and how it works but
[1:03:27] brother Adam said see but we can't only
[1:03:29] have mechanics he said but we've got to
[1:03:32] have the Dynamics of it he said see it
[1:03:35] makes the church live it makes it move
[1:03:39] and the power of the resurrection and
[1:03:42] until we come to that place until we
[1:03:44] find the place what good does it do to
[1:03:46] polish the hubs what good does it do to
[1:03:49] give her a face law a lift or a
[1:03:51] simonized job when there's no Dynamics
[1:03:53] in it no matter how much the mechanics
[1:03:56] prove to be right there has got to be a
[1:03:59] dynamics that will make that work
[1:04:01] think about you can prove this messages
[1:04:03] are as right ever ever service you can
[1:04:06] prove it's right every day in your life
[1:04:07] but till the Holy Ghost comes on it and
[1:04:11] makes it work in your life it does you
[1:04:13] no good come on church I'm gonna I'm
[1:04:15] gonna tell you what the word says the
[1:04:17] spirit brings life but the letter kills
[1:04:21] amen there's a lot of dead message
[1:04:23] people these days because they have went
[1:04:25] to letter letter letter letter letter
[1:04:29] and without the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:31] to come upon that life there's nothing
[1:04:33] to make it live it's a preacher what are
[1:04:36] you saying I'm saying if we're teaching
[1:04:37] the right thing it'll bring a power of
[1:04:39] God in the church said brother bam said
[1:04:41] it very clearly said the preaching of
[1:04:43] the mechanics is the gasoline and you
[1:04:45] try to get somewhere without gasoline
[1:04:48] come on Church crude oil made the
[1:04:51] gasoline gives you a way to go it's on
[1:04:53] the rise that's a great value in it
[1:04:55] because a lot of people ain't got it
[1:04:56] these days come on we need true word we
[1:04:59] need word preachers we must have word
[1:05:01] preachers but if it's gasoline let the
[1:05:04] spark come on it and see what happens if
[1:05:07] it's true gasoline Let the Fire come on
[1:05:10] it and see if it burns a little while
[1:05:12] but if we're just if we mixed up a bunch
[1:05:15] of ideas and we're putting water out in
[1:05:17] the church let the Holy Ghost fall and
[1:05:19] it'll just sputter out it'll just
[1:05:22] sputter a little but if it's real
[1:05:23] gasoline that's being put on the church
[1:05:26] when the fire of God begins to fall
[1:05:29] there's a spot that falls in the church
[1:05:31] and the Dynamics of God begins to move
[1:05:34] and you'll see Sons and Daughters of God
[1:05:36] moving and the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:41] oh hallelujah what good is it to talk
[1:05:44] about a God that used to be
[1:05:46] come on Friends brother man said we talk
[1:05:48] about God how he used to do and what he
[1:05:51] used to do and how he used to be you
[1:05:53] know what brother Graham said that was
[1:05:54] he said you're painting up a fire he
[1:05:57] said but no cold man ever got warm by a
[1:06:00] painted fire and it's amazing to me
[1:06:02] while men paint fires of yesterday they
[1:06:05] put out the fire of today they're
[1:06:08] talking about what God used to be and at
[1:06:10] the same time they'd laugh at the at the
[1:06:12] Holy Ghost they laugh at the emotional
[1:06:15] part of the spirit moving in the church
[1:06:17] they'd laugh at the prayer lines and the
[1:06:19] power of God that drops in the church
[1:06:21] but if it's a true and Spirit-filled
[1:06:24] god-cult man that's something that'll
[1:06:27] ring True by the word of God and bring
[1:06:30] life upon the generation that we have
[1:06:32] come to I don't think we ought to paint
[1:06:34] a fire I think we ought to plant the
[1:06:36] same seed they planted preach the same
[1:06:39] gospel they preach and if the gospel is
[1:06:41] preached with power it'll produce power
[1:06:43] it'll bring power
[1:06:47] now I'm sorry some people say well Wayne
[1:06:49] I've been in some of your meetings of
[1:06:51] people are just too loud and they just
[1:06:53] shouting and hollering and clapping and
[1:06:55] saying amen you excuse me this message
[1:06:57] has power I'm sorry if this message has
[1:07:00] enough power to get an amen out of
[1:07:02] somebody I thank God that this message
[1:07:05] will not allow us to delay dormant and
[1:07:08] quiet the prophet of God said the Holy
[1:07:10] Ghost is a man will amen the word of God
[1:07:13] something on the inside we're going to
[1:07:15] scream out to the outside I'll tell you
[1:07:17] why more people don't do it now because
[1:07:19] they've been intimidated by the mocking
[1:07:22] spirit of the end time that had black
[1:07:24] named the moving of the spirit of God
[1:07:26] but I believe somebody has got to be a
[1:07:29] real Pride somewhere that's the Holy
[1:07:31] Ghost and still move on the church and
[1:07:33] the power of God can still move in the
[1:07:36] power and demonstration of God in the
[1:07:38] Church of the Living God you said
[1:07:40] preacher what are you talking about I'm
[1:07:41] talking about the Easter message
[1:07:43] we know the Thanksgiving message another
[1:07:46] man said the Thanksgiving message you
[1:07:47] never done it in the first place and
[1:07:49] they ain't never been one priest like
[1:07:50] that brother amen you did it in the
[1:07:52] first place but how many knows what he
[1:07:53] said the Easter message is he said the
[1:07:55] Easter message is the Dynamics and the
[1:07:57] mechanics are together
[1:07:59] and we're not waiting on it it's here
[1:08:01] we're not waiting on the Dynamics it's
[1:08:03] here the mechanics is here and so is the
[1:08:06] Dynamics that'll make that Mechanics
[1:08:08] Work in our life and it will only work
[1:08:11] as it comes together
[1:08:14] now when brother Brown preaches about it
[1:08:16] you know what he does he takes Adam and
[1:08:18] he takes out of Adam Eve he said where
[1:08:20] do you come from the rib
[1:08:21] God formed her body from the rib the
[1:08:23] same as he formed the bride from the
[1:08:25] word
[1:08:26] because the second Adam came from the
[1:08:28] word
[1:08:29] he said so he forms the second Eve from
[1:08:31] the word but where did Eve get her
[1:08:34] spirit
[1:08:35] she didn't get another Spirit she got
[1:08:37] Adam's spirit
[1:08:38] God put Adam's spirit in Eve and she
[1:08:41] lived and because he lived she lived and
[1:08:45] the Church of the Living God has been
[1:08:46] built from the material of the word and
[1:08:49] it's a perfect church it's a masterpiece
[1:08:51] bride she's built in the very image of
[1:08:54] the god of Mercy that opened the word
[1:08:56] and designed her from the higher part of
[1:08:58] his mind we did not design ourselves we
[1:09:01] did not design the church there's been a
[1:09:03] prophet Among Us that we are now the
[1:09:05] spoken word literal seed bride of Jesus
[1:09:08] Christ the designer has designed her the
[1:09:11] architect has anointed her and when that
[1:09:14] body comes to Perfection there's got to
[1:09:16] come a dynamics that makes her live this
[1:09:19] ain't a dead bride this ain't a dead
[1:09:21] word she's a living breathing
[1:09:23] manifesting Church of the Living God
[1:09:25] it's a preacher what are you talking
[1:09:27] about can we just clarify what the
[1:09:28] Dynamics are
[1:09:30] I know y'all know what the Dynamics is
[1:09:32] somebody hollered out
[1:09:34] what is the Dynamics
[1:09:36] it's a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:40] how many knows Brothers said that you
[1:09:41] you identify with me do you know it if
[1:09:44] you don't put it up the Dynamics of the
[1:09:46] church will be a refilling of the Holy
[1:09:49] Ghost can we say it again the Dynamics
[1:09:51] to the church will be a refilling of the
[1:09:55] Holy Ghost the mechanics is the teaching
[1:09:57] of the word the Dynamics is a refilling
[1:09:59] of the Holy Ghost how many knows brother
[1:10:01] Branham said you can only prove the
[1:10:03] resurrection by a Pentecostal blessing
[1:10:06] you can't prove it any other way he said
[1:10:09] you'll never theologically prove it
[1:10:10] you'll never prove it he said by your
[1:10:12] education he said only the Pentecostal
[1:10:15] blessing can prove the resurrection of
[1:10:17] Jesus Christ I'm on church amen the
[1:10:20] Dynamics of the Church of the Living God
[1:10:22] is a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:26] I said Mel you lost your mind no I ain't
[1:10:28] lost my mind somebody's going to have
[1:10:30] the fire of God somebody's going to have
[1:10:32] the light of God listen this is Matthew
[1:10:34] 25 I'm preaching Matthew 25 straight up
[1:10:37] to you and with ten virgins went out and
[1:10:39] they all had they all had oil and they
[1:10:42] all had lamps
[1:10:43] come on that is use of Pentecost brother
[1:10:45] Brandon said they dipped it they dipped
[1:10:47] in the Holy Ghost it wasn't it but they
[1:10:49] dipped into it and they all walked
[1:10:52] together but that was a dispensational
[1:10:53] change come y'all know that and those
[1:10:56] Azusa Street Pentecost didn't carry any
[1:10:59] oil in their lamps they had what they
[1:11:01] had but that's all they had but those
[1:11:03] other virgins carried a vessel with them
[1:11:06] and they walked with that word and they
[1:11:08] stayed with that word do you all
[1:11:10] recognize that when the Midnight Cry
[1:11:12] came and when the and when the the all
[1:11:14] the lands had gone out now but those
[1:11:16] five wise versions the Bible said they
[1:11:19] refilled the oil in their lamps they
[1:11:22] refilled the oil can you imagine that
[1:11:25] there's somebody going to refill the
[1:11:27] lamp somebody's Gonna Keep The Fire
[1:11:29] Burning come on church amen this is the
[1:11:32] end of the year the fire's been burning
[1:11:34] but we can't let it go out we can't let
[1:11:36] the fire of God go out of the church
[1:11:39] he said preacher what are you talking
[1:11:41] about that was a supernatural Fire Star
[1:11:43] art in the Bible that the priest offered
[1:11:46] God's burnt offerings on Supernatural
[1:11:48] fire and they couldn't have Strange Fire
[1:11:50] or they would die with Strange Fire
[1:11:52] right that that gives the mystery of why
[1:11:55] Elijah poured so many barrels of water
[1:11:57] on the on the fires that they tried to
[1:11:58] start with false gods he said I'll not
[1:12:01] have no Strange Fire on this Altar and
[1:12:03] the altar of this bride we don't have a
[1:12:05] Baptist fire we ain't got a Pentecostal
[1:12:07] fire we've got the fire of the
[1:12:10] supernatural God and in the beginning
[1:12:12] was God and in the end is God and he's
[1:12:15] come to refill the church to Quicken
[1:12:17] them to bring Dynamics oh Lord Jesus to
[1:12:21] bring this mortal flesh to his flesh
[1:12:24] if you ever thought about that I'm gonna
[1:12:27] quote brother random to you mortal flesh
[1:12:29] becomes his flesh
[1:12:33] amen now we're still in Rise of the sun
[1:12:35] mortal flesh becomes his flesh
[1:12:37] amen you said brother Wayne how are we
[1:12:39] supposed to do that he said accept the
[1:12:40] word and it will transform you
[1:12:42] it'll take you from what you was to what
[1:12:44] you're supposed to be
[1:12:46] it'll transform you amen it'll transform
[1:12:49] and his word brings forth Sons and
[1:12:51] Daughters of God that's what it's
[1:12:52] supposed to do
[1:12:53] I live
[1:12:55] he live also that's speaking to his wife
[1:12:59] to be quickened from the dead now you
[1:13:01] know Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1 and
[1:13:04] you who he hath quickened
[1:13:07] who were dead in sins and trespasses
[1:13:09] were in times past you walked according
[1:13:12] to the course of this world according to
[1:13:14] the prince of the power of the spirit of
[1:13:16] that now worketh in the children of
[1:13:17] Disobedience among whom we had our
[1:13:19] conversation in times past in the lust
[1:13:21] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:13:24] our flesh and our mind and were by
[1:13:26] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[1:13:29] others I'd like that don't you by Nature
[1:13:31] not by seed we were by Nature the
[1:13:35] children of Wrath even as others amen
[1:13:37] but God who is rich in Mercy isn't that
[1:13:39] a powerful let me ever listen to that
[1:13:41] tape God rich and mercy 1965 but God who
[1:13:44] is rich in Mercy I'll tell you what amen
[1:13:46] there's my story right there but God I
[1:13:50] was going this way but God
[1:13:53] I I got Paul's testimony but God who is
[1:13:56] rich in Mercy this man riding this was
[1:13:59] on his way to kill Christians
[1:14:01] when God stepped into his path and he
[1:14:04] said who are you Lord who are you he
[1:14:07] said I am Jesus whom thou persecutive
[1:14:09] and look at what he done he blinded the
[1:14:12] Man's eyes so he could see
[1:14:14] [Applause]
[1:14:16] somebody shout hallelujah he blinded his
[1:14:20] eye so he could see he saw the great
[1:14:23] Pillar of Fire and it captured his
[1:14:25] vision and that's all he could think
[1:14:27] about and all that he could talk about
[1:14:29] because he had seen it with his own eyes
[1:14:31] he identified it was Jesus who was
[1:14:34] speaking to him look at what he did amen
[1:14:36] when he seen that he was only look at
[1:14:38] what he did amen when he seen that he
[1:14:41] was on his way to do something horrible
[1:14:43] and let me say something to you but God
[1:14:45] who is rich in Mercy sometimes it ain't

[1:15:24] never kissed a boy she never dated the
[1:15:25] boy I was the first boy she ever dated
[1:15:26] or anything in her whole life she didn't
[1:15:28] have a clue what the world was about
[1:15:31] and she said to me one time she said
[1:15:33] well I don't really have the testimony
[1:15:34] like I was delivering from this this I
[1:15:36] said if you ever stopped and thought you
[1:15:38] got brother branham's testimony
[1:15:41] you ever thought about that maybe
[1:15:42] somebody's sitting in here tonight you
[1:15:43] was raised on church pew and you come up
[1:15:45] and said well I heard about this God's
[1:15:47] in the world and they come out and I
[1:15:48] don't have their testimony no you've got

[1:15:51] drink you never smoke you never dope you
[1:15:53] never committed adultery you never had
[1:15:55] fun come on church because God had a
[1:15:57] word for you so some of us are testified
[1:16:00] at the grace of God but he can bring you
[1:16:02] out of and some of you are testifying
[1:16:04] what he could keep you out of either way
[1:16:07] God be glorified tonight if that Pillar
[1:16:10] of Fire has come into the church with
[1:16:12] anointing and with power do you see what
[1:16:14] it was amen Paul was the one writing
[1:16:17] that scripture there he hath raised us
[1:16:18] up together he when he were dead in sins
[1:16:21] he hath quickened us together and by
[1:16:23] Grace you are saved it's powerful Paul's
[1:16:25] talking about a resurrection right there
[1:16:28] Paul's talking about a resurrection
[1:16:30] brother man said see what caused this
[1:16:32] change
[1:16:33] he said there was a time being dead but
[1:16:36] to Quicken means to make alive there was
[1:16:38] a change from Death to life I'm
[1:16:41] preaching to you now there's supposed to
[1:16:43] be a resurrection in the end time
[1:16:45] something brings the bride from Death to
[1:16:48] life I live ye live is that right
[1:16:51] brother bam says see there was something
[1:16:53] he said there's no other thing that
[1:16:54] could happen to a person so great is a
[1:16:56] change from Death to life if a man was
[1:16:58] dying physically he could get healed
[1:17:00] physically but it'd be a great thing but
[1:17:02] nothing so great as when a spiritually
[1:17:04] dead and God quickens that man to life
[1:17:07] nothing paragraph 38 same scripture he
[1:17:11] says yep once same message yet once in
[1:17:13] times past you were dead and many of you
[1:17:15] here tonight one time can look back and
[1:17:18] know you were dead
[1:17:19] but now you ain't dead tonight

[1:18:34] surrendered at all what this is it's a
[1:18:36] little sign between me and the devil and

[1:19:05] by ourselves Because He Lives ye live

[1:19:24] ain't going back
[1:19:26] I'm on your hands
[1:19:30] and I say I wasn't always in church
[1:19:32] I I was a little bit rougher when I was
[1:19:34] in school
[1:19:35] and I was about seventh grade I think I
[1:19:37] was four foot ten and you ain't gonna
[1:19:39] believe this but I probably weighed 130
[1:19:41] pounds sopping wet
[1:19:43] I was a scrawny Feller
[1:19:46] but I grew up with three older brothers
[1:19:48] her two older brothers one younger
[1:19:50] brother but you know what I found out
[1:19:51] one day a big old boy big old boy come
[1:19:54] over and he told me she's gonna whip me
[1:19:55] I looked at him a minute and I said well
[1:19:57] I'll tell you what you do I think you
[1:19:59] probably can but you got it to do
[1:20:02] what you waiting on
[1:20:06] sometime or nothing you've got to tell
[1:20:08] the devil well you might do it but what
[1:20:09] you waiting on
[1:20:10] because if you're waiting on me to back
[1:20:12] up I ain't backing up if you're waiting
[1:20:14] on me to quit I ain't quitting if you're
[1:20:16] going to defeat me you're going to have
[1:20:17] to do it looking right at me because
[1:20:19] there's no retreat in me there's no
[1:20:21] backup in me there's no quitting me
[1:20:23] listen you're the Church of the Living
[1:20:25] God it's been anointed for the age we
[1:20:28] know who we are we know why we're
[1:20:30] standing here we know what we're about
[1:20:34] we know why we're here Amen brother bam
[1:20:37] said you got eternal life tonight if we
[1:20:38] have eternal life then you always were
[1:20:42] because there is only one form of
[1:20:44] eternal life
[1:20:46] and the reason we were is because we are
[1:20:49] a part of God and God is the only thing
[1:20:52] that's eternal
[1:20:53] somebody said to me one time so brother
[1:20:55] Wayne hey man how do you believe in this
[1:20:56] predestination stuff I said because I
[1:20:58] was a part of God
[1:20:59] just same as your son's a part of you as
[1:21:02] a part of him I didn't exist outside of
[1:21:04] God but as his life existed so when he
[1:21:07] manifestes his life it becomes a son
[1:21:10] through manifestation it's alive amen
[1:21:12] now now I I I just I'll just say this
[1:21:16] amen I'm going to preach the message now
[1:21:18] somebody's got a little idea or they
[1:21:20] think this way or think that way that
[1:21:21] don't that's not anything to do with me
[1:21:23] I'm just going to stay with a message
[1:21:25] that all right with y'all and the
[1:21:26] prophet of God said but one day you
[1:21:27] being a part of God you had to be a part
[1:21:29] of the word and when you heard the words
[1:21:31] you knew where you come from and you
[1:21:34] knowed it was the truth you were always
[1:21:36] see the seed was always in you the word
[1:21:40] seen the word and that was before the
[1:21:42] foundation of the world saw the word and
[1:21:44] you come to it and you said preacher
[1:21:46] amen now I don't I don't understand that
[1:21:49] well let me sit let me put it in
[1:21:50] hillbilly terms now the prophet taught
[1:21:52] us a lot of stuff if you come off the
[1:21:54] farm things get simple
[1:21:56] if you'll hillbilly you catch the
[1:21:58] message quick he said it was a little
[1:22:00] duck born down in the chicken yard one
[1:22:02] time and he said that little duck was
[1:22:04] trying to fit in you talking about an
[1:22:05] ugly duck amen he didn't look like none
[1:22:08] of the other people he was with he was
[1:22:09] webbed footed and had this bill he
[1:22:11] seemed funny talk funny act funny and he
[1:22:14] was different but thank God he was
[1:22:16] different
[1:22:17] right you were different you always was
[1:22:19] different I remember in high school I
[1:22:22] was different when I was in college I
[1:22:23] was different when I was with my friends
[1:22:25] I was different they amen I was always
[1:22:27] different I didn't understand why I was
[1:22:29] different but I was different
[1:22:31] and that duck was different and brother
[1:22:34] man said things went pretty good to one
[1:22:36] day he walked around the barn and he saw
[1:22:38] a pond out there he said the first time
[1:22:40] he smelled that water he went straight
[1:22:43] to it I'll tell you what him and because
[1:22:45] he was a duck to begin with amen it
[1:22:48] didn't change what he was it only
[1:22:50] revealed what he was and the prophet of
[1:22:52] God said see we always was a son you
[1:22:55] were a son to begin with the same thing
[1:22:58] that is to believe her there's something
[1:23:00] in him when he meets God face to face he
[1:23:02] comes to himself the seed is in him and
[1:23:06] it's quickened watch it's resurrected
[1:23:09] now that's why I'm preaching this it's
[1:23:11] Resurrection it's a quickening of that
[1:23:13] seed brother man said something got to
[1:23:15] hold of us something quickerness and
[1:23:17] that seed come to life they commence
[1:23:19] filter brother man said notice the word
[1:23:21] cannot deny itself it is satisfied or
[1:23:24] it's a desire of what what made you
[1:23:26] desire it in the first place now that's
[1:23:29] the question isn't it what made you want
[1:23:31] this us to begin with that's a powerful
[1:23:34] question sister April I tell you what
[1:23:36] that if that that is the answer to our
[1:23:38] life what made you want it to begin with
[1:23:40] what made you desire it out of all the
[1:23:43] others of all the people of all the
[1:23:44] situation you desire I'll tell you what
[1:23:46] it is brother random said because down
[1:23:48] in your soul there was a predestinated
[1:23:51] seed with eternal life that was always
[1:23:54] laying there it always was in there and
[1:23:59] all the father hath given to me will
[1:24:01] come there isn't any of them going to be
[1:24:04] lost
[1:24:05] brother praise be to God you said
[1:24:07] preacher what are you talking about
[1:24:08] brother Madam says it and take a man's
[1:24:10] filter he said when I think a man begins
[1:24:12] to think who he's going to stand before
[1:24:14] and the word of God when he begins to
[1:24:17] think then he begins to draw through
[1:24:19] that there's see there's nothing can get
[1:24:22] to it but the Holy Ghost oh brother amen
[1:24:27] how can a prophet of God say you would
[1:24:29] never commit adultery that you were
[1:24:31] ordained to begin to make a stand it
[1:24:33] blew my mind one day I was listening to
[1:24:35] brother Branham he said there's a second
[1:24:37] Eve that won't fall I mean it was it was
[1:24:39] a it was a mind-blowing revelation
[1:24:41] brother man said here it is here's the
[1:24:43] secret the second Eve cannot fall I fall
[1:24:48] dear Lord how can she not fall and one
[1:24:51] day a couple years later I'm listening
[1:24:53] to another sermon and brother Branham on
[1:24:55] the tape he says she can't fall he said
[1:24:57] that first Eve she fell from the word
[1:25:01] now that's that's the secret she fell
[1:25:03] from the word he said but now that
[1:25:06] second Eve can't fall because she is the
[1:25:09] word
[1:25:10] oh brother amen she can't fall because
[1:25:14] she is the word amen and heavens and
[1:25:17] earth could pass away but my word will
[1:25:21] never fail look at that if that word
[1:25:24] Amen brother bam said what is it it's
[1:25:26] the germ the c word from the beginning
[1:25:28] that God Amen you was in God at the
[1:25:32] beginning standing there drawing see
[1:25:34] life the seed is in Your Heart by for
[1:25:37] the nation the seed is already in there
[1:25:39] by the foreknowledge of God
[1:25:41] predestinated when it draws it can't
[1:25:43] draw nothing but the word look at that
[1:25:47] God put something in you that can't
[1:25:49] receive nothing but the Holy Ghost
[1:25:51] isn't that powerful the Bible said in
[1:25:54] the last days it would begin so
[1:25:56] deceptive it would deceive the elect
[1:25:58] brother man said there's election he let
[1:26:01] if it were possible isn't that powerful
[1:26:04] that if it was possible you could be
[1:26:06] deceived if it were possible you
[1:26:08] wouldn't be able to but God has designed
[1:26:11] you in such a way that you could not
[1:26:13] receive anything but this word
[1:26:17] my my mother there's only one thing that
[1:26:20] will pass through there that's the Holy
[1:26:22] Ghost amen what is it it's God Awakening
[1:26:25] the church to bring the promises of God
[1:26:28] effective upon the church now I want you
[1:26:30] to think about this brother man said
[1:26:31] there'll be a second crucifixion of
[1:26:33] Jesus Christ right he said the church
[1:26:35] would have a second crucifixion of Jesus
[1:26:37] Christ he said but this time it won't be
[1:26:40] crucified on a Roman Tree he said it'll
[1:26:42] be crucified from the pulpits right he
[1:26:46] said what do they do he said they don't
[1:26:48] they don't crucify the flesh they
[1:26:50] crucify the effect the word has upon the
[1:26:53] church we don't want to crucify the
[1:26:55] effect of the word but the word was sent
[1:26:57] that it might manifest Christ in the
[1:27:00] church now look at what he said it'll
[1:27:02] bring an Effectiveness in the church now
[1:27:04] watch this brother man said there's
[1:27:05] three Realms there's three Realms we
[1:27:07] live in we live in a human realm we live
[1:27:10] in a divine revelation realm but the
[1:27:12] Third Realm is a vision realm and look
[1:27:15] at the church we have we have moved to
[1:27:18] the realm of vision God has had a vision
[1:27:20] of the Church of what she should be we
[1:27:23] are living in the vision of God
[1:27:25] concerning the bride in the end time
[1:27:28] look at Ezekiel 37 it said that he would
[1:27:31] cause the Israel to come out of the
[1:27:34] graves those Graves were not natural
[1:27:36] Graves they were Graves of Russia and
[1:27:38] Germany and Italy and they were grazed
[1:27:41] all over the world because they were
[1:27:42] Jews to begin with they were born in the
[1:27:45] wrong place they were placed in the
[1:27:47] wrong countries but they were Jews to
[1:27:49] begin with and God would bring them back
[1:27:51] to their Homeland o Church of the Living
[1:27:54] God and God has a message you were in
[1:27:57] the graves of baptism in the grace of
[1:28:00] Lutheran and in the graves of
[1:28:01] denomination but God said I'll bring
[1:28:04] them out of the Grave there shall be a
[1:28:07] resurrection in the end time what is it
[1:28:10] it's a resurrection God has opened the
[1:28:12] graves and called the church out of the
[1:28:15] Grave I tell you it's a powerful thing
[1:28:17] when you begin to study the resurrection
[1:28:19] I know I know when you study I know when
[1:28:22] you study here and you see them when you
[1:28:24] see Lazarus in the Bible it's a natural
[1:28:27] resurrection of course it is but it
[1:28:29] would be would it be all right if we
[1:28:30] typed into the supernatural in the
[1:28:32] spiritual Resurrection would that be
[1:28:34] okay with y'all do y'all recognize that
[1:28:36] he was raised on the fourth day
[1:28:39] do you recognize that Jesus went the
[1:28:42] other way until he was already gone
[1:28:46] and returned when it was too late for
[1:28:49] him to resurrect and it happened to be
[1:28:52] an evening time he returns and comes
[1:28:56] according to vision and you you watch
[1:28:58] you the beauty of the scriptures amen
[1:29:00] that one of the girls stayed in the
[1:29:02] house and the other goes out to meet him
[1:29:04] you know there's a lot of going on there
[1:29:05] amen but but I want to get this point
[1:29:08] that Jesus was coming for the reason to
[1:29:12] fulfill the vision of Resurrection
[1:29:14] he was going to resurrect Lazarus and
[1:29:17] Lazarus was in the grave now y'all y'all
[1:29:20] study restoration of the Bright Tree you
[1:29:22] studied Joel 2 you know that there was
[1:29:24] four bugs of death and there's four
[1:29:26] Restorations right the last one is the
[1:29:29] word and the word itself was coming for
[1:29:33] the resurrection of Lazarus and the word
[1:29:36] itself comes for the resurrection of the
[1:29:38] Bride somebody else didn't come to
[1:29:40] resurrect you but the word came to do
[1:29:42] the resurrection now and when he found
[1:29:45] was wasn't it Martha comes out I got it
[1:29:47] written down here but it but it was it
[1:29:49] was here in the scripture amen that when
[1:29:51] I believe it was Martha comes out to him
[1:29:54] and she actually says to him Lord
[1:29:57] if you would have been here my brother
[1:29:58] wouldn't have died
[1:30:00] I think it was good over she said Lord
[1:30:02] at least if you would have been here
[1:30:04] when my brother Wouldn't Die do you know
[1:30:05] brother Brown said right there she had a
[1:30:07] right to be mad at him
[1:30:09] she had a right to ball him out for
[1:30:10] going the other way when she needed he
[1:30:12] said she had a right to do it he said
[1:30:14] but if she had took her right she
[1:30:17] wouldn't have seen the supernatural
[1:30:19] he said and you've got a right to live
[1:30:21] the way you want you got a right to
[1:30:22] think the way you want but if you keep
[1:30:25] your right you will never see the
[1:30:27] supernatural that resurrects the church
[1:30:30] right but she surrendered that right and
[1:30:33] called him Lord and said if you had been
[1:30:36] here my brother wouldn't have died and
[1:30:39] Jesus and Jesus therefore amen I think
[1:30:42] it's powerful amen that's when he began
[1:30:44] to tell her listen now amen amen Jesus
[1:30:47] said to her won't you just take me to
[1:30:49] the place where the stone lay upon it
[1:30:51] and Jesus said take away the stone
[1:30:52] Martha and the sister of him that was
[1:30:54] dead saith unto him Lord and by this
[1:30:57] time he stinks he's been dead four days
[1:31:01] now what she's telling him is I
[1:31:03] appreciate you trying but this ain't
[1:31:05] going to happen now
[1:31:07] this thing's too far gone for there to
[1:31:09] be a resurrection now you should have
[1:31:11] come a couple of days ago while this
[1:31:13] thing was still revivable
[1:31:14] but you've let it go too far too long
[1:31:17] and it ain't going to happen now and
[1:31:19] Martha said to him she said unto him
[1:31:21] Lord but this time he stinketh and he
[1:31:23] said been dead four days and Jesus said
[1:31:25] unto her I say unto thee that if thou
[1:31:28] wouldest believe thou should see the
[1:31:30] glory of God then they took away the
[1:31:32] Stone from the place where the dead was
[1:31:34] laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and
[1:31:38] said father I think thee that thou has
[1:31:41] hurt us me and I know thou has hurt us
[1:31:43] me always but because of these people
[1:31:45] which standby I say it that they may
[1:31:47] believe that thou has sent me and when
[1:31:50] he thus had spoken he cried with a loud
[1:31:52] voice Lazarus
[1:31:55] come forth now y'all know y'all know
[1:31:58] what that means that means a dead man
[1:32:01] four days in the grave he's done
[1:32:03] fellowshipping with Abraham
[1:32:05] he's done sitting at the table he's done
[1:32:08] talking with David and Abraham he's
[1:32:10] setting their fellowship and he hears a
[1:32:13] voice
[1:32:14] Lazarus
[1:32:16] can you imagine when he stopped and
[1:32:18] turned around and looked at all of them
[1:32:19] said hey y'all hear something
[1:32:22] y'all hear something no we don't hear a
[1:32:25] thing brother Brandon said look he said
[1:32:27] if he hadn't said the man's name the
[1:32:30] entire grave would have emptied but he
[1:32:32] called him by name I hope you're hearing
[1:32:35] me tonight amen I'm talking about a
[1:32:37] resurrection in the graveyard I'm
[1:32:39] talking about laodicea everything is
[1:32:42] dead but he called your name and there's
[1:32:45] a Revival in the middle of laodicea
[1:32:48] because a Lamb's Book of Life was opened
[1:32:51] and he called you by name
[1:32:53] I'll tell you what man he heard that
[1:32:55] voice and he was trained to that voice
[1:32:58] he was trained to that voice and he
[1:33:01] answered that voice you know what do you
[1:33:02] know what the prophet of God said about
[1:33:04] it he said Martha told him said Lord
[1:33:05] said it's too late and brother Brown
[1:33:07] says watch what she says but even now
[1:33:10] but even now brother man said there was
[1:33:12] a turning point
[1:33:14] but even now amen and he told this woman
[1:33:17] go go roll away the stone and Jesus said
[1:33:19] unto him Lazarus come forth and a man
[1:33:22] that's been dead four days comes out of
[1:33:24] the Tomb I'm talking about Resurrection
[1:33:25] a man been dead four days comes out of
[1:33:29] the Tomb because life was speaking that
[1:33:33] dead could not stay in the grave when it
[1:33:35] called his name
[1:33:37] now you may remember the service
[1:33:39] brotherhead you may remember the service
[1:33:41] when something called your name brother
[1:33:44] you remember when it was that you were
[1:33:46] sitting and something called you by name
[1:33:48] amen some of you said maybe you was in
[1:33:50] some other place but something
[1:33:52] identified you and you can't get away
[1:33:55] from it you can't shake loose of it you
[1:33:57] can't outrun it amen something has
[1:34:00] identified you in this resurrection and
[1:34:02] you come forth from out of the grave now
[1:34:05] I want you to watch something here John
[1:34:06] 14 go back to the 19th verse and let's
[1:34:09] read that verse again and let's read 19
[1:34:11] and 20 together and uh can I share
[1:34:13] something a little Revelation here with
[1:34:15] you amen John John 14 verse 19 and 20. I
[1:34:18] want you to watch something happens here
[1:34:19] amen now I've got a bunch of quotes on
[1:34:22] it I'm not going to read them too
[1:34:23] because I don't have time but John 14-19
[1:34:25] what he says yet a little while and the
[1:34:28] world seeth me no more but you see me
[1:34:29] now there's your two resurrections
[1:34:31] because I live ye live also what happens
[1:34:35] in the very next verse what's the next
[1:34:37] verse and at that day oh that's Sunday
[1:34:41] at that it's Sunday yo at that day ye
[1:34:45] shall know that I am in the father
[1:34:47] and you and me and I and you brother
[1:34:51] random breaks that down to this day
[1:34:53] right but he continues to say this is
[1:34:57] when Elohim becomes tangible in the
[1:35:00] bride
[1:35:01] y'all remember brother bam said it's the
[1:35:03] it's God amorphe In Bright form right
[1:35:06] amorphous speaks of the invisible
[1:35:09] becoming visible he becomes a visible
[1:35:12] tangible God in The Bride of Jesus
[1:35:15] Christ you become the hands and the feet
[1:35:18] and the body it is the bride body of
[1:35:20] Jesus Christ now if it's been
[1:35:22] resurrected now he's telling you you're
[1:35:25] going to be transformed that your mortal
[1:35:28] flesh will become his flesh so it isn't
[1:35:30] good enough for you just to be alive
[1:35:31] you've got to take on the word even the
[1:35:36] power of transformation y'all heard it
[1:35:37] y'all heard the entire take mother said
[1:35:39] now that we're saved now that we're
[1:35:41] filled with the Holy Ghost what do we do
[1:35:42] he said we're to be formed of the image
[1:35:44] of Christ
[1:35:45] so we're to take on the word that it
[1:35:47] would it would bring us into the image
[1:35:49] that God had designed us to be in in the
[1:35:52] back part of his mind and there's only
[1:35:54] one message it can get you there
[1:35:57] i i i i Alan's a good probably a good
[1:36:01] preacher Billy Graham's got some good
[1:36:03] thoughts uh I heard brother Andrew said
[1:36:06] it one time somebody said something
[1:36:07] about TD Jake said got some good points
[1:36:09] he said I got some good I got some
[1:36:10] pencils in my drawer it's got good
[1:36:11] points too
[1:36:15] we ain't talking about good points we're
[1:36:17] talking about the bride of Christ
[1:36:19] and if you want to be a good church
[1:36:21] member listen to any preacher you want
[1:36:22] to you want to be the bride of Christ
[1:36:24] you better get out of this message
[1:36:27] it's the only thing that can develop you
[1:36:30] into the image that God saw you in to
[1:36:32] begin with so he resurrects the bride
[1:36:35] and then he shows himself in the bride
[1:36:38] by the development of that word in the
[1:36:40] church it is the transforming power it's
[1:36:43] the strength in the part so watch what
[1:36:45] happens when Lazarus resurrects what's
[1:36:47] in the scripture when Lazarus resurrects
[1:36:50] Jesus don't leave him there he don't
[1:36:52] just resurrect him he turns and changes
[1:36:55] his dressing he says to them loose him
[1:36:59] yeah y'all know y'all know where brother
[1:37:01] Bram took that loose him he said let's
[1:37:04] take that word in the Book of Revelation
[1:37:06] 21 and there's a new Heaven and a new
[1:37:08] Earth coming down a new Heaven because
[1:37:10] the old Heaven and the old Earth that
[1:37:12] passed away but then said no it's not
[1:37:14] annihilated he said it's a change it's a
[1:37:17] change of the governments it's a
[1:37:19] changing of the of the of the politics
[1:37:22] it's a changing of the control brother
[1:37:24] Brian breaks it down in three worlds old
[1:37:26] world present World New World right he
[1:37:30] changes the thing he adorns it so what
[1:37:32] are we talking about that that word pass
[1:37:35] away means to loosen from the former
[1:37:38] condition
[1:37:39] it means to release from the bondage of
[1:37:42] what it has been amen that was an old
[1:37:45] Lazarus that was the present Lazarus and
[1:37:48] there was a future Lazarus the Church of
[1:37:51] the Living God Amen God wasn't going to
[1:37:53] leave him in the present State he was
[1:37:55] alive but it was bound up
[1:37:58] look at the Scripture it said loose the
[1:38:00] man and let him go
[1:38:02] blue seem and let him go I've got a
[1:38:06] vision for him I've got a purpose for
[1:38:08] his life it's the same words Jesus said
[1:38:11] to his disciples concerning the cult
[1:38:13] remember that amen Zechariah said he
[1:38:16] would enter the city right in that colt
[1:38:17] that cult was ordained to be the thing
[1:38:20] that carried the word of God now of my
[1:38:23] goodness there ain't enough time to
[1:38:24] preach I just ain't got enough time to
[1:38:26] preach y'all too good a congregation
[1:38:27] amen that that cult sitting there and I
[1:38:31] the reason I say that because I want to
[1:38:32] preach on the mule right now the
[1:38:35] cross-eyed lop-eared not need bowled
[1:38:39] back y'all remember him
[1:38:40] and he said I'm going to die at the
[1:38:42] moment the farmer sees me y'all remember
[1:38:44] that one I'm going to die the moment the
[1:38:46] farmer sees me brother Ben said but he
[1:38:47] had a scriptural taught mother and she
[1:38:49] said honey he don't sacrifice mules he
[1:38:52] sacrifices Lambs so in the morning he
[1:38:55] ain't coming to get you he's going to
[1:38:56] come and get a lamb and if he finds a
[1:38:58] lamb you can live and if it finds the
[1:39:01] lamb brother Brown that's when he said
[1:39:02] any old any you know any old man could
[1:39:05] be redeemed y'all know what I'm talking
[1:39:07] about amen anyone can be redeemed if you
[1:39:10] find the lamb and the prophet of God
[1:39:13] said when that when that when that mule
[1:39:15] got its lamb he kicked his feet up and
[1:39:17] joined it I I mean maybe it's a stretch
[1:39:19] but I kind of figured that was the cult
[1:39:21] that was tied down there
[1:39:24] for some reason they didn't write him
[1:39:28] and some reason nobody wanted I'm
[1:39:30] preaching to you for some reason the
[1:39:33] world didn't want you for some reason
[1:39:35] you were a reject everywhere you went
[1:39:37] but there was a land for you so God
[1:39:40] didn't kill you he held you to a time
[1:39:43] that he would lose you God would send
[1:39:45] the servant somewhere to untie the knot
[1:39:47] that held you that you could pack this
[1:39:49] word I'll tell you when he come off of
[1:39:51] the mountains in the Book of Matthew and
[1:39:54] he'd come off of that mountain and they
[1:39:55] began to rejoice and scream and holler
[1:39:57] and praise God Amen I tell you what's
[1:39:59] powerful I bet that I bet that colt
[1:40:01] might have felt pretty good a time or
[1:40:02] two and all them people shouting and
[1:40:04] screaming but they wasn't looking at him
[1:40:05] they were looking at that lamb
[1:40:08] okay
[1:40:09] thank God the word has chose a vessel to
[1:40:12] ride into this age
[1:40:14] take away the grave clothes that hold
[1:40:17] the man he's been in them closed four
[1:40:19] days he stinks he's he is he has
[1:40:22] transferred his stinking rotting
[1:40:25] corrupted flesh has transferred to the
[1:40:27] clothing he's wearing and he's he's not
[1:40:30] presentable and God won't leave him that
[1:40:32] way and nor will he leave his bride
[1:40:35] dressed in the rags of unrighteousness
[1:40:38] of denominational teachings he will not
[1:40:40] leave us come on Church the rejection of
[1:40:43] a prophet he said the the crowning of my
[1:40:45] ministry will be the dressing of this
[1:40:48] bride she'll be adorned in the
[1:40:50] righteousness of the word of God
[1:40:53] y'all know where I'm at don't you
[1:40:55] take the grave clothes off I love how
[1:40:58] y'all y'all ever y'all ever you ever
[1:40:59] preach on that much it's powerful point
[1:41:01] of scripture it said it was bound hand
[1:41:03] and foot
[1:41:06] he was bound by his feet was bound his
[1:41:10] hands were bound and you know you could
[1:41:12] start at the bottom just go up if you
[1:41:14] wanted to he was bound hand and foot
[1:41:16] y'all ever think about this uh years and
[1:41:19] years and years ago I preached the
[1:41:20] entire sermon titled mummified
[1:41:22] Christians
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:24] y'all can just imagine how that went
[1:41:28] thank you
[1:41:29] see you're alive but you're bound
[1:41:33] see Lazarus was alive he was breathing
[1:41:36] but his feet was bound y'all don't want
[1:41:39] that you don't want that you know what
[1:41:40] I'm talking about he couldn't walk
[1:41:42] he couldn't obey the word he couldn't
[1:41:44] walk the word now I like to put it over
[1:41:47] a little bit like this he couldn't dance
[1:41:49] either
[1:41:51] isn't it something God give us all these
[1:41:53] wonderful musicians
[1:41:55] come on Church
[1:41:56] [Applause]
[1:42:01] now adopted church has good musicians
[1:42:04] it's part of the body
[1:42:06] and these musicians that was ordained of
[1:42:09] God to play so a church that's going to
[1:42:11] be positioned in place going to have
[1:42:12] musicians God's going to bless you God's
[1:42:14] going to put them there and you said
[1:42:16] well when we don't have any well you've
[1:42:17] got to send them you got to get them
[1:42:19] there but if you got him God gave them
[1:42:21] to you
[1:42:23] now you said preacher why you say that
[1:42:24] because they some people don't like to
[1:42:25] hear our musicians play
[1:42:27] don't let them play with their heart you
[1:42:29] know they want to play want them to play
[1:42:31] but not play
[1:42:33] y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:42:35] play but don't play
[1:42:38] you know play but don't put your heart
[1:42:40] in it
[1:42:41] but I think you ought to put your heart
[1:42:43] in it
[1:42:44] I don't think you're playing for
[1:42:45] American Bandstand you playing for God
[1:42:47] [Music]
[1:42:48] come on church I know there's Church of
[1:42:51] Christ Spirits right here in the message
[1:42:52] I know it is they don't want to see our
[1:42:54] musicians enjoy what they do and play
[1:42:56] their music but God does God loves music
[1:43:00] I'm in the message you know I am
[1:43:03] amen and again God loves music but if
[1:43:06] you got good music what happened that we
[1:43:08] can't dance
[1:43:10] now I'm in the Bible y'all know I'm in
[1:43:13] the Bible Psalms 150 said praise God in
[1:43:15] the dance
[1:43:18] now it's either the word or it ain't the
[1:43:19] word
[1:43:21] come on church but something has took
[1:43:23] the dance out of the church y'all tell
[1:43:25] me who took it out
[1:43:26] somebody tell me please
[1:43:28] tell me who took the dance out of the
[1:43:30] church who bound the feet of the Bride
[1:43:33] so they can't dance no more
[1:43:35] now I I you know I'm just being honest I
[1:43:38] know I know we got a mixed congregation
[1:43:40] in here and you know what I mean it's
[1:43:42] it's a powerful thing to me that people
[1:43:44] have a liberty to dance I feel a little
[1:43:46] check right there a fell a little
[1:43:48] something come in the room but let me
[1:43:49] tell you something about that I know
[1:43:51] where I'm at scripturally
[1:43:53] you don't have authority to take the
[1:43:55] dance out of the church
[1:43:58] God put it in and by what Authority do
[1:44:01] you take it out
[1:44:03] come on Church
[1:44:04] I don't believe y'all y'all have
[1:44:06] hootenannies around here
[1:44:09] huh you used to have hoot nannies I grew
[1:44:12] up and they were hoot nannies all around
[1:44:13] where I was at they'd go out and drink
[1:44:15] yeah they dust the floor with some flour
[1:44:18] and they'll help play their banjos and
[1:44:20] this and that and they'll get out there
[1:44:20] and Hoot nanny I don't think our young
[1:44:22] people ought to have to go to a hoot
[1:44:24] Nanny to enjoy dancing
[1:44:27] right I don't believe it I don't believe
[1:44:29] the first time your young person dances
[1:44:31] they ought to have to go to a hoot Nanny
[1:44:33] to do it I think we are to get an
[1:44:34] atmosphere in the church that it ain't
[1:44:36] how to order to dance
[1:44:37] [Applause]
[1:44:41] somebody worried about a kid crying here
[1:44:43] a while back and I told him I said if
[1:44:44] you was in Africa you wouldn't even hear
[1:44:45] that kid
[1:44:47] but our churches get so quiet that every
[1:44:49] little thing bothers us
[1:44:51] somebody say Amen
[1:44:53] but I'll tell you what if you get the
[1:44:55] grave clothes off bring the worship back
[1:44:58] in the church amen left the Church of

[1:45:22] teeth he said if you go to heaven the
[1:45:24] angels of God are going to be worshiping
[1:45:26] y'all read the book of Isaiah
[1:45:29] and Isaiah went to the temple and the
[1:45:31] Bible said that the voice of the Angel
[1:45:34] shook the temple post brother man said
[1:45:37] that was one Angel did that
[1:45:39] one Angel the voice of one Angel shook
[1:45:43] the temple post he said what's it going

[1:45:48] a million Angels worshiping God at the
[1:45:51] same time brother let me tell you what

[1:46:36] finally delivered me amen of what
[1:46:38] everybody in the church thought about me

[1:46:55] presence of God and what about a

[1:46:59] the power of the Holy Ghost come down on
[1:47:01] the church I tell you what I think I

[1:49:12] taken off
[1:49:14] no shame to this God I serve
[1:49:18] no that you you can just go right up
[1:49:20] can't you because he had a the Bible
[1:49:22] said he had a cloth upon his face
[1:49:25] which spoke of what was coming his mouth
[1:49:28] was covered
[1:49:29] his eyes was covered he couldn't see the
[1:49:32] word he couldn't speak the word he
[1:49:34] couldn't prophesy he couldn't he
[1:49:36] couldn't rejoice in the spirit he was
[1:49:38] bound by grave clothes but God didn't
[1:49:40] leave him there he resurrected him and
[1:49:43] took the grave clothes and this message
[1:49:45] has done more than resurrect us it's
[1:49:48] done more than Quicken us it has loose
[1:49:50] the bands that would hold the church
[1:49:52] that they might have Liberty and have it
[1:49:55] with the spirit of God he said preacher
[1:49:56] what are you talking about I'll tell you
[1:49:57] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[1:49:59] a spiritual Resurrection but not left
[1:50:01] like you were I see it in the scripture
[1:50:03] when the prodigal son come home y'all
[1:50:05] remember he left but when he got ready
[1:50:07] to come home how many knows what the
[1:50:08] Bible said he said I will arise
[1:50:12] and go back to my father's house you
[1:50:14] know what he was doing come on church he
[1:50:16] was about to eat the husk of Pentecost
[1:50:19] he was getting ready to eat hush because
[1:50:21] he was living in a famine but the only
[1:50:23] reason he was in a famine is because it
[1:50:25] wasn't his position and he was trying to
[1:50:27] be somebody else and listen somebody
[1:50:29] else probably can be that but not you
[1:50:32] you'll never make it out there brother
[1:50:34] you ain't you ain't anointed to be there
[1:50:37] and when that man got ready to go home
[1:50:39] he said I'll go home and be a servant
[1:50:41] even the Servants of my father's house
[1:50:43] eat better than this out here what I'm a
[1:50:46] fooling with and he got ready to go home
[1:50:48] and the Bible said he arose do you know
[1:50:50] when he got home the Bible says his dad
[1:50:52] said my son that was dead
[1:50:56] is alive
[1:50:57] he resurrected church he meant it was a
[1:51:01] spiritual Resurrection he was dead but
[1:51:03] he was alive it's your story you were
[1:51:06] dead but you come alive
[1:51:08] gave your life and look at what happened
[1:51:10] when that prodigal son got to coming
[1:51:12] home listen there's a lot of men come
[1:51:14] over that Hill
[1:51:15] there's a lot of men walked down that
[1:51:17] road but when that father seen that one
[1:51:20] come
[1:51:21] when he seen that one coming he didn't
[1:51:23] let him get to the house
[1:51:25] no sir he didn't let him get to the
[1:51:27] house you know what he done he ran out
[1:51:28] and met him
[1:51:30] they sang that song the only time God
[1:51:32] Ran it was powerful isn't it God got up
[1:51:34] and
[1:51:37] why he he met him out
[1:51:41] I thought about it he met him out there
[1:51:43] and said my son that was dead is alive
[1:51:45] but you know what he did when he met him
[1:51:47] out there he embraced him how he was
[1:51:51] you know brother random said the moment
[1:51:53] you said in your heart I'm sorry God
[1:51:55] accepted it
[1:51:57] look at this Amen brother Brown talks
[1:51:59] about brother man talks about this and
[1:52:01] he talks about that mother of the
[1:52:02] prodigal son do you know what he said
[1:52:04] the reason they knew he was coming home
[1:52:06] he said because she had been praying he
[1:52:09] said in the angel of the Lord was about
[1:52:11] a half hour in front of the boy and said
[1:52:12] your boy's coming home
[1:52:15] so they was expecting him that morning
[1:52:17] because something had supernaturally
[1:52:19] taken place and when he started coming
[1:52:21] over there that was their boy
[1:52:25] that was their son
[1:52:27] and he was coming home and that Dad went
[1:52:30] out to meet him
[1:52:31] you know what he said I I don't have
[1:52:33] time to preach on the best road but I'll
[1:52:34] tell you this powerful thing right here
[1:52:36] he said bring me the best robe do you
[1:52:38] all know what the best robe is in a
[1:52:40] house like that
[1:52:41] that was not a poor man
[1:52:44] he said bring me the best robe
[1:52:48] bring me the best robe we got
[1:52:52] come on now the boy was standing there
[1:52:54] and his father
[1:52:55] the father took off the dirty garments
[1:53:00] and put his own personal robe around his
[1:53:04] own son
[1:53:06] look at what he did he was identifying
[1:53:09] that boy this is my son this is not a
[1:53:13] servant and no matter what you think
[1:53:15] about yourself and no matter what the
[1:53:17] devil has said about you you cannot
[1:53:19] return to God as a servant because you
[1:53:21] never were a servant you never were an
[1:53:24] angel you always was a son and you can
[1:53:27] only come home as a son and when he got
[1:53:29] ready he put that best robe upon that
[1:53:31] boy and I tell you what man you could
[1:53:34] preach an hour on this thought right
[1:53:35] here and he took the shoes and put upon
[1:53:38] his feet
[1:53:39] he said Preacher what's that matter
[1:53:40] because back in those days
[1:53:43] slaves didn't have no shoes
[1:53:47] slaves wasn't allowed to wear shoes
[1:53:50] and it allowed them to identify a slave
[1:53:53] a long ways off
[1:53:55] but that man was trying to come home as
[1:53:58] a slave and he couldn't receive him as a
[1:54:00] slave the household couldn't receive him
[1:54:03] as a slave he was not a slave he was a
[1:54:06] son so his father put shoes on his feet
[1:54:09] put a robe upon his hand Put a Ring upon
[1:54:12] his finger you said preacher what do you
[1:54:14] get now he would not allow that boy to
[1:54:16] go home in the condition he came in he
[1:54:19] wouldn't let the rest of the house see
[1:54:21] him in that condition but he changed it
[1:54:24] before he got him home whole Church of
[1:54:26] the Living God there's a pride that's
[1:54:28] going to hold one of these mornings
[1:54:31] but we're not going home without shoes
[1:54:33] we're not going home without a robe
[1:54:35] we're not going home without a ring but
[1:54:38] the heavens will see you the way God saw
[1:54:40] you to begin with
[1:54:41] [Applause]
[1:54:43] praise the Lord preacher what are you
[1:54:45] talking about I'm talking about you're
[1:54:46] the property of God and he has a right
[1:54:47] to redeem you
[1:54:49] he has a right
[1:54:51] to unclothe you from what you've been
[1:54:53] clothed and put on you now I know some
[1:54:55] of you I know some of you spent a long
[1:54:57] time in the world I'm closing I know
[1:54:59] some of you spent I know some of you
[1:55:01] spent your time and some of the
[1:55:02] situations you're in let me say
[1:55:04] something to you I don't care how long
[1:55:07] I don't care how long the devil's had a
[1:55:09] hold of you
[1:55:10] he has no right to hold you
[1:55:13] God owns you
[1:55:16] God owns you and has a right to call for
[1:55:18] you to come out of that grave
[1:55:20] and to change the robe that you're
[1:55:22] wearing
[1:55:24] you know something something come to my
[1:55:26] attention here just a few days ago I was
[1:55:29] down at my dad's and we we grew up we
[1:55:31] grew up there in Arkansas and most of
[1:55:33] our surveying down there pretty sorry I
[1:55:35] just have to be honest back in back in
[1:55:37] the 40s and the 50s you know they used a
[1:55:39] rock in a tree and you know
[1:55:42] it was a little bit matter of fact the
[1:55:44] the road that goes in front now where my
[1:55:46] dad it did it just twists like this they
[1:55:49] ain't a straight road there you know all
[1:55:51] the property lines are straight but the
[1:55:52] roads go around because it cursed
[1:55:55] through one guy's property and back to
[1:55:56] another guy's he don't fall in the
[1:55:58] property lines you know so everything's
[1:56:00] just goofed up and him and him and his
[1:56:02] neighbor up there there was kind of an
[1:56:04] old man's land and they got in the fight
[1:56:05] when I was a little kid they got in a
[1:56:06] fight over the property in the front
[1:56:07] yard my dad he hauled a bunch of dirt
[1:56:09] and took a dozer and fixed it all and
[1:56:12] and that guy come off the hill one day
[1:56:13] after it got good and fixed you know he
[1:56:15] came off the hill and claimed it he said
[1:56:16] this this property is mine my dad said
[1:56:18] ain't your property you live in the city
[1:56:20] this is in the county get get back where
[1:56:22] you come from
[1:56:25] he got pretty rough you know we weren't
[1:56:27] Christian people and we it got rough out
[1:56:29] there and it went to fist fights and
[1:56:31] then troubles and and people got hurt
[1:56:33] and one day I asked my dad I said Dad I
[1:56:36] said yeah I've never seen you fight with
[1:56:37] nobody I've never seen you fight like
[1:56:39] this with anybody I said what in the
[1:56:41] world is going on that land matters to
[1:56:43] you that much he said Son
[1:56:46] he said if I met that man out on the
[1:56:48] street somewhere I'd have some words to
[1:56:49] get away from him he said we was out
[1:56:51] here and and he come up to me in the in
[1:56:54] the gas station I could walk off and
[1:56:55] leave him I didn't get a fight with him
[1:56:57] he said but he come to my front door
[1:57:00] he said how far do you want me to run I
[1:57:02] can't run no further he's got me in a
[1:57:04] corner
[1:57:05] he said I gotta fight he said if a man
[1:57:08] won't fight for what belongs to him he
[1:57:09] ain't no man in him
[1:57:11] I said I got you I understand that's
[1:57:13] that's good
[1:57:14] so after a little while that fight went
[1:57:17] away and my dad buys a property next to
[1:57:19] him another lot and that it's it's a
[1:57:21] nice little lot there but when they
[1:57:23] built the house on the lot they built a
[1:57:26] road right in front of the house the
[1:57:27] house was setting on that guy's property
[1:57:31] but because the road was built there it
[1:57:33] was an easement and as long as the house
[1:57:34] was there they couldn't do nothing about
[1:57:36] it so when the people that owned the
[1:57:37] house passed away my dad made an offer
[1:57:39] to buy it and the night he bought it the
[1:57:41] guy burns the house down
[1:57:43] so he now has that piece of property by
[1:57:47] law he he contains that piece of
[1:57:49] property and it cut my dad off from the
[1:57:51] road so uh here a while back and then
[1:57:54] back this spring my sister she bought
[1:57:56] her a trailer she wanted to sit on that
[1:57:57] property well she comes down my dad's
[1:57:59] driveway sets the property up but soon
[1:58:01] she sets the trailer Here Comes the Sun
[1:58:02] to the guy I mean it's a family
[1:58:04] tradition here comes the son to the guy
[1:58:06] and he says he says you can't do that
[1:58:09] and you can't be here and they put a
[1:58:10] fence up man it was well it was Katie
[1:58:13] bar in the door try to cut him off from
[1:58:14] water and ready to fight and everything
[1:58:16] else well my nephew's a state policeman
[1:58:19] so when he showed up there to say What's
[1:58:21] Happening Here everything started
[1:58:22] calming down a little bit more you know
[1:58:24] so so I heard about him all the way in
[1:58:26] Ohio and so I I I called my parents and
[1:58:29] talked to them and I come down well if
[1:58:32] you come to my dad's house when you come
[1:58:34] off the main street it's a it's a hill
[1:58:36] you come off the main street you think
[1:58:38] you'd just come straight to his house
[1:58:39] you know but you got to go around
[1:58:42] this corner and then you come down to
[1:58:44] this house so his driveway literally
[1:58:46] curves just like that well in the curve
[1:58:49] of the driveway is a big old shop
[1:58:51] building belongs to that same guy
[1:58:53] so I got a plan of the whole area
[1:58:54] because I used to survey years ago so I
[1:58:56] said we're going to fix this final if if
[1:58:58] one property line matters all the
[1:59:01] property lines matters let's just figure
[1:59:02] out what's what so I'm looking at a
[1:59:04] plant and when you look down on that
[1:59:05] plant that guy has built his shop right
[1:59:09] in the middle of my dad's driveway
[1:59:12] and I'm like this guy that's so worried
[1:59:14] about that property line has a shop
[1:59:16] setting in your driveway in the property
[1:59:18] lines
[1:59:19] literally I said dad get you a lawyer
[1:59:22] make the man move the thing and put
[1:59:24] these property lines back and let's end
[1:59:25] this fight for sure he said son I went
[1:59:27] to a lawyer the other day and asked him
[1:59:29] about that very thing
[1:59:30] he said they can't do nothing about it I
[1:59:33] said what
[1:59:34] he said yep it's been there over 20
[1:59:36] years he said in the state of Arkansas
[1:59:38] seven years
[1:59:40] is a squatter's right uncontested it
[1:59:43] belongs to the man now seven years
[1:59:46] uncontested it I mean thing we can do
[1:59:49] about it I said nothing he said nothing
[1:59:52] I said dear Lord
[1:59:54] squatters rights and I got to think
[1:59:56] about that
[1:59:58] I thought you know brother remember said
[2:00:00] the devil was a squatter
[2:00:02] that's when you take true that's when
[2:00:04] you take trespassing too far
[2:00:06] it's one thing to walk across the man's
[2:00:08] grounds another thing say it's yours
[2:00:10] and Satan is trying to not cross your
[2:00:14] life he's trying to claim your life
[2:00:17] but brother Bradham said but by
[2:00:19] scripture there is no squatter right
[2:00:23] so there's no legal time no matter how
[2:00:27] long the devil has been plaguing you
[2:00:29] there's no time limit that says that he
[2:00:33] can stay
[2:00:34] so brother bam says Satan first of all
[2:00:36] you're a squatter remember he says
[2:00:39] you're a squatter he said then the
[2:00:42] church has a right to enforce the legal
[2:00:44] claim
[2:00:46] upon what God has given now I'm not
[2:00:48] often in a left field somewhere another
[2:00:50] man said restoration of Bright Tree when
[2:00:51] the Sun rises he said it forces the
[2:00:54] claim of life upon the seed and makes it
[2:00:58] return back no matter how long the
[2:00:59] Winter's been when the light begins to
[2:01:01] shine the flowers come out and brother
[2:01:03] mam said and Satan is a squatter in your
[2:01:06] life and has no right to stay there do
[2:01:08] you know if you've been sick even for a
[2:01:10] long time Satan is a squatter and all
[2:01:13] you have to do is notify him that he has
[2:01:16] no right to stay here and you have a
[2:01:18] right to enforce that rule upon him
[2:01:20] tonight for salvation or for healing for
[2:01:23] your body amen maybe a spirit's been
[2:01:25] plaguing you for years and Satan's
[2:01:27] saying to you you're always going to be
[2:01:29] nervous you're always going to be
[2:01:31] anxious you're always going to be
[2:01:32] depressed you're always going to have
[2:01:34] this sickness you're always going to
[2:01:35] have this trouble I've been here for 10
[2:01:37] years and you can't make me leave he's a
[2:01:39] liar
[2:01:41] and he's a squatter on the property of
[2:01:44] almighty God
[2:01:46] he's a squatter church he said preacher
[2:01:48] what are you saying I'm saying the Bible
[2:01:50] said a woman had an issue of blood 12
[2:01:53] years
[2:01:55] y'all ever wonder why it numbers the
[2:01:56] years
[2:02:00] but when she touched Jesus
[2:02:05] it was over

[2:02:55] 66 years
[2:03:00] 66 years
[2:03:03] and in one meeting
[2:03:05] the man walked

[2:03:15] there's no time limit
[2:03:18] you see I've been suffering with this
[2:03:19] problem a long time brother Wayne I

[2:03:22] squatter and he has no right

[2:03:33] came

[2:03:36] gray clothes off of them
[2:03:39] 38 years
[2:03:41] did you ever notice that Georgie Carter
[2:03:42] was nine years
[2:03:45] and some odd months
[2:03:48] nine years
[2:03:50] by the way the first time I realized why
[2:03:52] she was in that condition it broke my
[2:03:54] heart
[2:03:56] y'all know why Georgie Carter was laying
[2:03:58] there nine years
[2:04:00] her uncle was taking her to a piano
[2:04:02] lessons and raped her
[2:04:05] and it put tuberculosis in her body
[2:04:08] she wasn't laying there for her own
[2:04:10] account somebody did that to her
[2:04:15] but God said no matter what somebody
[2:04:17] done to you
[2:04:19] no matter why you're in the condition
[2:04:21] you're in
[2:04:22] even at Mid nine years
[2:04:26] and a prophet came by under vision
[2:04:29] and said thus saith the Lord rise
[2:04:31] and the woman got up and walked
[2:04:34] nine years
[2:04:36] I told this testimony down to brother
[2:04:38] Tim's meetings in the fall
[2:04:40] but last year you know brother you know
[2:04:42] Brother David Cross and Heather cross
[2:04:44] from Josh Bennett's brother Davids the
[2:04:46] cross Brothers to him and yeah
[2:04:49] every church has got his cross right
[2:04:53] Brother David and sister Heather
[2:04:56] anybody anybody know Heather no she
[2:04:58] suffered with arthritis about 15 years
[2:05:01] she it was bad enough me and her talked
[2:05:04] about it a couple years before before
[2:05:05] that meeting
[2:05:07] last year on the Saturday night they
[2:05:08] brought her in Joe Joe Adams actually
[2:05:11] said I feel led tonight sister Heather
[2:05:13] that you would come in this prayer line
[2:05:15] they brought her in the prayer line and
[2:05:16] when they did
[2:05:18] good
[2:05:19] spirit of God moved in there and after
[2:05:22] 15 years
[2:05:24] she was instantly healed in that meeting
[2:05:30] free
[2:05:32] after 15 years
[2:05:35] you know the devil's told some of y'all
[2:05:37] that it's been too long
[2:05:40] but things been it's been there too long

[2:45:47] thank you
[2:45:51] for everybody
[2:45:56] now let's give him a good hand
[2:46:09] you know some people think
[2:46:11] that we as
[2:46:14] preachers pastors ever how you want to
[2:46:17] say it that we you know I'm gonna call
[2:46:20] Brother Wayne because I like him or
[2:46:22] because
[2:46:23] no
[2:46:24] yeah we do get suggestions
[2:46:28] but what I tell you you ask every
[2:46:30] Minister that's come to my this church
[2:46:32] in the past year and a half
[2:46:35] what do I tell them
[2:46:36] I tell them thank you for helping my
[2:46:38] people
[2:46:43] right
[2:46:44] thank you for helping my people
[2:46:46] because we labor in a different way as a
[2:46:49] pastor and as assistant pastor we labor
[2:46:50] in a certain way but then we we have
[2:46:52] brothers as a five-fold Ministry
[2:46:55] that'll touch your heart like I can't
[2:46:57] touch it touch your heart like brother
[2:46:59] Dale can't touch you we can touch your
[2:47:02] heart like brother Wayne can't touch
[2:47:03] that's why you need a five-fold Ministry
[2:47:06] and and we we enjoy bringing ministers
[2:47:10] in but it's not just we don't flip a
[2:47:12] coin
[2:47:13] we don't just
[2:47:14] we just don't you know go through a list
[2:47:16] and say well I'll bring no
[2:47:20] we know the background of our brother
[2:47:21] and I knew we needed we needed him at
[2:47:24] the end of this year
[2:47:25] I knew we needed I called him a long
[2:47:27] time ago
[2:47:29] and he said yeah I'll be there
[2:47:31] and I was pleased
[2:47:33] that he would come
[2:47:35] and all the other ones we've had and all
[2:47:38] the ones coming up brother they're award
[2:47:39] different ones it's not just that we
[2:47:41] don't do it frivolously
[2:47:43] brother Dutch coming with a wonderful
[2:47:45] wife and always been just an absolute
[2:47:48] solid I mean I love solid people I lived
[2:47:52] under one for 60 years my dad you know
[2:47:55] so I said and not wish you wash in going
[2:47:58] off on this Doctrine and off on that
[2:48:00] Doctrine well somebody say amen amen
[2:48:03] amen solid so then we bring solid people
[2:48:06] in here
[2:48:08] we bring people that can preach the word
[2:48:09] of God and they can what what brother
[2:48:12] what brother Branham say he said all a
[2:48:14] preacher does is breaks the scale that
[2:48:17] the devil has put on your eyes out there
[2:48:19] and you come in here and you say God I
[2:48:23] got I'm alive but I'm going to own grave
[2:48:25] clothes I can't praise you I can't dance
[2:48:32] because I bet you Lazarus was trying to
[2:48:35] say thank you Jesus and he was going
[2:48:38] and Jesus said listen
[2:48:40] get him out of them grave clothes well
[2:48:43] he don't need them no more
[2:48:45] and that's why we're we don't need this

[2:52:50] 2022. brother Dale felt bad that and
[2:52:54] horrible cough on Monday November the
[2:52:57] 21st I called his primary doctor he
[2:53:00] couldn't see him so he had to see a PA
[2:53:03] that was Tuesday November the 22nd I was
[2:53:06] able to give him a bath and get his
[2:53:08] clothes on to go to the doctor we set up
[2:53:11] we were sitting on the couch and I was
[2:53:13] reaching down to put on his shoes and he
[2:53:15] fell off the couch sled off the couch
[2:53:18] into the floor
[2:53:20] I couldn't get him up Lisa come and
[2:53:22] helped me tried to help me get him up
[2:53:24] everybody else was gone so we couldn't
[2:53:26] get him up so Lisa come in and she said
[2:53:29] I'm going to call the paramedics to help
[2:53:31] us so she went outside to wait on the
[2:53:34] paramedics so brother Dale was still on
[2:53:37] the floor and I stood over him and I
[2:53:40] said Lord
[2:53:41] said we've got to get him up out of this
[2:53:44] floor
[2:53:46] well the next thing I knew I was
[2:53:48] standing over and he was about let six
[2:53:51] feet away laying on the floor
[2:53:53] and when I got to myself he was sitting
[2:53:58] on the bed six foot away out of the
[2:54:01] floor and I was standing beside of him
[2:54:04] well I did not know when I I did not
[2:54:08] walk over there he did not walk over
[2:54:11] there to the bed so the Lord had to come
[2:54:14] to our house that day amen
[2:54:22] and when you when you've went through a
[2:54:26] vision like this you'll never be the
[2:54:28] same person
[2:54:31] so the next thing that I knew that he
[2:54:34] was sitting on the bed and I was
[2:54:36] standing beside of him I don't remember
[2:54:38] any of that he doesn't remember any any
[2:54:41] of that the guy God had to move on me
[2:54:44] too because I was over there with him
[2:54:46] and I did not walk over there I did not
[2:54:48] walk over there so when Lisa come in she
[2:54:52] said with a paramedic she said well
[2:54:55] Nanny how did you get him up out of the
[2:54:57] floor I said I didn't I don't know he
[2:55:01] was on the floor when she left about 10
[2:55:03] minutes before when she got back with a
[2:55:06] paramedic he was sitting on the bed and
[2:55:08] I was standing beside of it
[2:55:12] they checked him and and said they would
[2:55:16] take him to ER but he'd probably catch
[2:55:18] more than what he already had so then
[2:55:22] um when he got to the doctor's office he
[2:55:24] had a high temperature that was why he
[2:55:26] was out of his head they gave him an
[2:55:29] antibiotic and the next day he went back
[2:55:31] and they called him and said they wanted
[2:55:34] a covet test we took him back for a
[2:55:36] cover test and it was positive so
[2:55:40] thank God he had a mild case that time
[2:55:42] this is the third time he's had it
[2:55:45] anyway thanks I want to thank him for
[2:55:49] visiting our house that day
[2:55:57] and we asked him that night I

[2:56:03] did not know anything from that morning
[2:56:05] until late that night he did not know
[2:56:08] anything that went on he didn't know he
[2:56:11] went to the doctor he didn't know
[2:56:12] anything
[2:56:13] so I just praised it with a glorious

[3:03:48] can I see a show of hands of who in here
[3:03:50] knows that I have back issues
[3:03:55] not bad not bad I want to tell you the
[3:03:57] story
[3:03:58] okay
[3:04:00] some of you know that I used to be a
[3:04:02] flight attendant back in the mid 70s I
[3:04:04] worked for a company called Capital
[3:04:06] Airways out of JFK Airport in New York
[3:04:10] and I lived in Connecticut
[3:04:14] I was working a flight
[3:04:16] from Europe to New York
[3:04:19] and we used to have these metal tray
[3:04:21] carriers that housed your meals in
[3:04:24] food tray carriers and I
[3:04:28] bent down to pick one up
[3:04:31] and my back locked
[3:04:33] and you know when something's locked you
[3:04:35] try to see if it's going to unlock it
[3:04:37] didn't
[3:04:38] but after about two minutes I was able
[3:04:40] to straighten up
[3:04:42] and I work that flight into New York got
[3:04:46] in my car
[3:04:47] drove the two-hour commute home
[3:04:50] went to bed and the next morning I
[3:04:54] couldn't move
[3:04:56] went to you know hospital and all that
[3:04:58] stuff
[3:04:59] they said I sprained my lower back and
[3:05:03] my neck
[3:05:04] the diagnosis is
[3:05:07] degenerative disc
[3:05:09] severe spinal stenosis
[3:05:12] and nerve impingement and for you those
[3:05:15] youngins or those who are not familiar
[3:05:17] with medical jargon I'll break it down
[3:05:18] for you
[3:05:20] nerve impingement is just as it sounds
[3:05:22] the muscles the tendons are all pressing
[3:05:25] on the nerves
[3:05:27] degenerative discs there's a sponge-like
[3:05:29] material in between each vertebrae in
[3:05:32] the spine it's degenerating
[3:05:35] okay so we got to get up out of here
[3:05:37] because it's going to continue to

[3:43:12] and he's going back to God when are we
[3:43:14] going to realize we came from God and
[3:43:17] we're going back to God Amen
[3:43:21] the scripture speaks of him speaks of us
[3:43:22] as I know what the prophet told us thank
[3:43:24] God for
[3:43:27] Authority on what the scripture is
[3:43:29] saying all right Jesus knowing that the
[3:43:31] father had given all things into his
[3:43:32] hand that he was come from God and he
[3:43:34] went to God
[3:43:36] he rises from suffering laid aside His
[3:43:38] Garment and took a towel I'm reading the
[3:43:40] let me go to Corinthians I'm reading the
[3:43:45] Paul tells us in second Corinthians
[3:43:49] I thought he was going to do some foot
[3:43:51] washing but not tonight
[3:43:55] you know Paul it took Paul
[3:43:57] um but there's always told us
[3:44:00] and I don't know if you thought of this
[3:44:01] or not but
[3:44:02] Paul was not in the upper room
[3:44:05] Paul was not there
[3:44:06] Matthew was there
[3:44:10] John was there
[3:44:12] nobody wrote about it like Paul did
[3:44:14] right because Paul had Clarity Paul knew
[3:44:18] what happened he knew why it was going
[3:44:19] to happen he was already born again when
[3:44:22] he wrote that so God just took him right
[3:44:23] back into the upper room and said for I
[3:44:27] have received of the Lord
[3:44:29] that which also I delivered unto you
[3:44:31] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[3:44:33] which he was betrayed took bread and
[3:44:35] when he had given thanks he break it and
[3:44:37] said take eat this is my body which is
[3:44:39] broken for you this do you in
[3:44:41] remembrance of me
[3:44:42] after the same manner also he took the
[3:44:44] cup and when he had stopped saying this
[3:44:46] cup is the New Testament
[3:44:48] that was an Old Testament they were
[3:44:50] living under the Old Testament but he
[3:44:52] said this is a new testament in my blood
[3:44:54] not animal blood my blood we're fixing
[3:44:57] to make a new testament that's why the
[3:44:59] New Testament didn't start Matthew
[3:45:01] Martin Luke and John
[3:45:03] Jesus lived in the Old Testament John
[3:45:06] was the one to bring us to the what to
[3:45:08] the new introduced the Messiah and then
[3:45:10] when he was crucified there was a new
[3:45:13] testament so the book of Acts is what
[3:45:15] really starts the New Testament
[3:45:17] as we know it amen after the same manner
[3:45:20] also he took the cup when he had stopped
[3:45:22] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[3:45:24] my blood this do you as often as you
[3:45:26] drinking in remembrance of me for as
[3:45:28] often as you eat this bread and drink
[3:45:29] this cup you do show the Lord's death
[3:45:31] until he comes wherefore whosoever shall
[3:45:34] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[3:45:36] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[3:45:38] body and blood of the Lord
[3:45:40] but let a man examine himself thank God
[3:45:42] he give us a place
[3:45:43] he said but
[3:45:45] let a man examine himself
[3:45:48] and so letting meat of that bread and
[3:45:50] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[3:45:52] drinketh unworthily either drinketh
[3:45:54] damnation to himself
[3:45:55] not Discerning the Lord's body now who's
[3:45:57] the Lord's body he was standing there in
[3:45:59] flesh but who's the Lord's body now
[3:46:00] that's me and you if you eat and drink
[3:46:03] this unworldly you're you're you're
[3:46:05] hurting the body
[3:46:06] right not the body sitting on the throne
[3:46:08] up there you're hurting the body here
[3:46:10] amen
[3:46:12] unconfessed sin brother Brown said make
[3:46:14] a congregation bitterly fail
[3:46:17] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[3:46:19] among you in many sleep
[3:46:21] let's get this right let's get this
[3:46:24] right and we won't have as much sickness
[3:46:28] we have seen people healed pop we've
[3:46:31] seen people healed taking communion
[3:46:34] I mean healed of
[3:46:36] um uh high blood pressure and sugar
[3:46:39] diabetes
[3:46:40] just by taking communion
[3:46:45] and if you're ever at home I want to
[3:46:47] tell you one thing if you're ever at
[3:46:48] home and you and you miss communion and
[3:46:50] you want communion if God will give me
[3:46:52] strength and Grace I'll bring it to you
[3:46:54] and you can take it at your house
[3:46:55] because we did that for one brother and
[3:46:57] that's why he got healed amen come up
[3:46:59] speaking in tongues right taking
[3:47:01] communion but if you need it if you
[3:47:03] can't get here on Sunday of the service
[3:47:05] you just call me and I'll try my best
[3:47:07] through all my three or four jobs I'll
[3:47:09] try my best to get over there or we'll
[3:47:10] get somebody to give you communion amen
[3:47:12] don't want you to miss it yeah because
[3:47:15] it cleans us it cleans us up it gets us
[3:47:17] to remember what God's done for us and
[3:47:19] that like I said this part of the Year
[3:47:20] this is remembrance of what God's done
[3:47:22] for us the whole year
[3:47:24] he's let us live as my brother said man
[3:47:26] he just let us get be here he's let us
[3:47:28] not just be here but being the best
[3:47:30] message in the face of the Earth the
[3:47:32] best people
[3:47:36] the best people on Earth yes
[3:47:39] why would you want to be somewhere else
[3:47:41] my word for this calls me near weak and
[3:47:44] sickly among you many sleep for if we
[3:47:46] would judge ourselves we should not be
[3:47:47] judged but when we are judged we are
[3:47:49] chasing of the Lord that we should not
[3:47:51] be condemned praise God
[3:47:54] with the world
[3:47:56] pulled apart separated from the world
[3:48:00] wherefore my brother when you come
[3:48:01] together to eat tarry one for another
[3:48:03] and if a man hunger let him eat at home
[3:48:06] that you come out together into
[3:48:07] condemnation
[3:48:08] and Paul says the rest will I set an
[3:48:10] order in other words when I come back to
[3:48:12] you Corinthians I'm going to set some
[3:48:13] things in order straighten some things
[3:48:15] out because remember the reason he said
[3:48:17] that is because they were having a
[3:48:19] drunken party
[3:48:20] making it to the Lord's table and he
[3:48:22] said no don't do that if you need to eat
[3:48:24] you go eat at home you go drink at home
[3:48:25] we're taking communion all right so
[3:48:28] let's tarry for just a moment the
[3:48:30] prophet of God said Terry he said pray
[3:48:32] for your pastor pray for brother Dale
