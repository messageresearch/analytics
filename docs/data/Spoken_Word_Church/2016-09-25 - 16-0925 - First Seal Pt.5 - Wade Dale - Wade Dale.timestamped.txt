[1:19] what we were problem at last sunday is
[1:22] the seal and let's read it before we go
[1:27] back to Jane let's read revelation 6
[1:34] first one I saw when the lamb opened one
[1:37] of the seals and I heard the noise of
[1:38] thunder one of the four beasts saying
[1:40] come and see saw and behold a white
[1:43] horse and he that sat on him had a bow
[1:45] and a crown was given unto him they went
[1:47] forth conquering and to conquer all
[1:50] right that's the opening of the first
[1:51] field now what you watch something that
[1:55] will it will help you as we flow through
[1:57] this
[2:03] right as we go through this watch the
[2:06] flow now he's going to get on he got on
[2:08] this horse at some point and Road which
[2:14] are horses a lot of power not a physical
[2:16] horse but it was it was a power but it
[2:22] was an evil power disguised as the white
[2:25] righteous church ok it was disguise
[2:27] because its way but I'm always went to
[2:33] the Bible on this one is if you're like
[2:35] it's a light that you think it's not
[2:37] like it's a light that you think you do
[2:41] you think it's like but it's not that's
[2:44] the greatest darkness and deception you
[2:46] can ever be in my father son Holy Ghost
[2:48] baptism Trinity you know if you believe
[2:52] that and that's part of your you're
[2:54] believing then you're deceived that's
[2:57] the biggest deception i read it to you
[2:59] in just a second out of the Bible and
[3:01] that's world remember Sunday right at
[3:04] the end I told you to watch this seal
[3:07] open up and show one true and living God
[3:11] ok dot 3921 true Living God because this
[3:20] fella is not God he's anti God and you
[3:25] say well how important is real important
[3:29] that that when when the property God
[3:31] said here stands a lamb with a book in
[3:33] this man that's not the third part or
[3:34] the second person of the Trinity Father
[3:37] Son and Holy though that's not the son
[3:38] standing there and the father somewhere
[3:42] helps and you got you know the Holy
[3:43] Ghost over here know Christ the Lamb the
[3:46] Holy Ghost one person God is one person
[3:51] with one personality not multiple
[3:54] personality that makes them let's get
[3:56] the phrenic come on in brother this is
[3:58] brother Gilbert right he is from
[4:02] cloverdale at brother fiscal dirty
[4:05] didn't have him with us today he's down
[4:07] for a conference where his work and he's
[4:11] going to be with us today we're good to
[4:12] have your brother god bless you come
[4:14] down in the south if you can't
[4:15] understand this just tell me you can
[4:16] understand on the plan you got it okay
[4:20] alright so we've been in the first seal
[4:23] now for a while and I want to come up to
[4:26] something because as we said before this
[4:30] seal was preached and broke by the Lord
[4:33] Jesus Christ in Matthew 24 right okay we
[4:37] ready Matthew 24 24 you come on in come
[4:40] on in there and find your seat we're a
[4:42] little tight today so come on in we've
[4:51] got the we've got to steal open now I I
[4:56] said before some say the seals are open
[5:00] some set of Steel's are closed right
[5:03] well if they say or if they whoever they
[5:05] have if they say the seals are close
[5:08] they are cuz you close your mind off for
[5:12] something you have clothes what God is
[5:13] open all right but Matthew 24 Jesus
[5:16] broke the seal it was in a mystery and
[5:19] then what did that same Jesus in the
[5:23] form of the holy ghost comes back on the
[5:28] that must I'll Pamela's and breaks the
[5:33] seal and symbol form to John right all
[5:39] right then we had a profit come in 1963
[5:44] in March and he brought the revelation
[5:47] of the seal right so we've had a
[5:51] three-fold confirmation Jesus himself
[5:54] reach them John wrote when he saw and
[5:57] then brother round took him and he give
[6:00] us the between the lines now let's not
[6:04] be so narrow-minded I like my brother
[6:05] round
[6:06] we're so narrow-minded you couldn't put
[6:08] a pencil between both eyes and not touch
[6:10] both of them that's real narrow minded
[6:13] when you got both eyes together alright
[6:15] that's going to be so narrow-minded
[6:19] excuse me to see that this is all there
[6:22] is to it brother ground it broke the
[6:26] seal 1963 right all seven I believe yes
[6:32] well why don't we take a raptor why are
[6:34] we 50 years down the road still teaching
[6:37] the same message right I thought he said
[6:40] it was a readiness of the bride not that
[6:42] the word wasn't here with the readiness
[6:43] of the people that are under the work
[6:44] that's the truth right so it's wonderful
[6:49] to know the symbols it's wonderful to
[6:50] know what they mean and the prophet of
[6:53] God told us what they made their right
[6:55] all right if he told us what they mean
[6:57] that we can take this this picture and
[7:00] put it together not by our own
[7:04] interpretation because remember we must
[7:07] read between the lines but it's got to
[7:09] compare with this line in this life all
[7:11] right when we you know many people if I
[7:15] brother's been in the message long
[7:16] enough he knows that a lot of people
[7:18] said that the seventh seal broke was
[7:20] polygamy are the seven still broke
[7:23] what's the seven thunders or seven
[7:24] voices like Joe Coleman and him up in
[7:26] New York you know that had to be seven
[7:29] people that broke the seals too it's not
[7:32] true that took them that didn't open to
[7:35] them that was man's idea that wasn't got
[7:38] all right just like Martin Luther
[7:40] preaching a trendy that what in God's
[7:42] idea God's never revealed a trendy
[7:46] colors nuts that stain God's never
[7:49] revealed three gods so they never won he
[7:52] ought to know that and if he teaches
[7:56] anything different he's not the real guy
[7:59] ok so the one that teaches that is
[8:02] somebody else and the proper and God
[8:05] said remember we've got twins so close
[8:09] so close Satan's not out in the barroom
[8:12] Saints not out in the prostitute rings
[8:15] in the places like that nice
[8:16] in church try but Nadia's in your head
[8:21] contrary to God's Word you shall what
[8:24] I'm immune to that well you're liar I
[8:29] was reading if you read your adoption
[8:32] series brother Brown said he was talking
[8:34] about sins he said a center I don't have
[8:38] since we were listening level of the
[8:41] night I read it again last night Center
[8:44] does not have sent sins I sent her as a
[8:48] center he's condemned because he don't
[8:51] even have anything of God he don't care
[8:54] he's just condemned but we as Christians
[8:58] have sins floral reading your adoption
[9:02] Siri we have sins around silly send
[9:05] every day but now the one inside was
[9:07] done the Holy Office thought I was never
[9:10] seen today in his life ya never had a
[9:12] bad thought never had a bad word there
[9:14] ain't anything right but we got to deal
[9:17] with the spirit realm in the flesh then
[9:19] really you don't be able to the flesh
[9:20] remember the flash is nothing with just
[9:22] them it's just the way you work this
[9:26] just holds one I am together alright
[9:29] because when you take this out what is
[9:33] this it's just a shell I'm not there
[9:36] anymore this is just a shell what's
[9:39] inside of me is that firing mechanism
[9:41] the property go I said that light that
[9:43] burns that makes your heart beat it
[9:46] makes all those things go together you
[9:48] know right and even in your spirit realm
[9:50] now you got to remember too that up I
[9:52] was think about this other day an animal
[9:55] doesn't help soul yeah it's a living
[9:57] being let's think about that so even the
[10:04] beast was a living being but he didn't
[10:05] tell salt an animal has life what that's
[10:09] the spiritual part of the person but a
[10:11] man is made in the image of God he has a
[10:14] soul because God is assault hey right
[10:17] and then now we take Satan and we see
[10:20] him trying to copy the reason that he is
[10:23] trying to copy is because God can make a
[10:25] soul and God
[10:27] he said don't worry about the one that
[10:29] killed the flesh he you worry about that
[10:31] man who can kill the soul is only one
[10:32] man can kill saw that's a guy thing
[10:34] created him killer right same can't kill
[10:37] yourself right no saying can't create
[10:43] another one so he perverts everything
[10:46] that God does he twists it just by one
[10:49] word yes I told y'all before and I'm
[10:52] telling you again if one word not got us
[10:55] out of the garden then that one word off
[10:57] is not going to give us back in the
[10:59] garden you show all that's impossible
[11:03] well Jesus was the sinless son of God on
[11:08] the earth right and human flesh right we
[11:11] know he wasn't born in sin but we are
[11:13] but you know what with the life that he
[11:15] has living in me it's what I told you
[11:17] the other day I want to tell you go
[11:18] don't beat yourself up if you're born
[11:20] again you're in rapture in condition
[11:22] you're already wrapped you're already
[11:23] sitting in heaven question their soul is
[11:26] actually in another dimension never
[11:29] that's where you get your revelation
[11:31] from you don't get revelation for this
[11:32] dimension Satan rules these first three
[11:35] dimension and really four and five see
[11:39] all them he's in and but God's got six
[11:41] and seven and he brings revelation from
[11:43] that seventh dimension and brings it to
[11:45] you and if it's a revelation from God it
[11:48] comes out of that faster dimension come
[11:50] then to that soul that you have and what
[11:52] there's that firing mechanism yeah
[11:55] everything's fired on the right cylinder
[11:57] alright everybody got that right so what
[12:01] are we doing we are showing the
[12:03] Antichrist but really this is let's go
[12:06] to the point to where this has got to be
[12:07] revealing Jesus Christ because of
[12:11] Revelation actually that what did he
[12:15] what did he do conquering and conquer he
[12:17] didn't go out physically kill people of
[12:20] course Satan is a killer destroyed but
[12:23] here this is spiritual he spiritually
[12:26] killed the people remember the first
[12:29] church age there was no badness
[12:30] Methodist Pentecostal there was no
[12:32] denomination to the first
[12:34] none so there was sure there were ideas
[12:38] sames don't remember those some sayings
[12:41] deeds to doctrines to incarnate right so
[12:44] the settings went out on this white
[12:46] horse he was saying even Paul says the
[12:49] greediest wolves have come among you and
[12:51] you'll keep reading the scripture it
[12:53] says that among you now so they were
[12:55] already there he knew that spirit of
[12:57] Antichrist Paul I mean dumb John when he
[13:00] comes back in Little John's he's talking
[13:01] about the spirit of Antichrist why don't
[13:04] each wingtip at once and saw what the
[13:05] thing was doing it was working through
[13:07] the church not through the world yes all
[13:11] right property gosh that if we get quite
[13:13] a revelation to the two spirits in the
[13:14] framework of the church message church
[13:18] not that turns out yonder this church
[13:23] because there is two spirits in this
[13:25] church if we have the pinnacle true Word
[13:28] of God which I believe we do we hold the
[13:30] truth more than anyone on the face of
[13:32] the earth don't you think that's the
[13:34] first thing they going after he's not
[13:36] going after he's coming right here all
[13:39] right he's gonna be so close and behold
[13:41] a white horse he's telling had a boat so
[13:43] we know it wasn't bluffing he had a bow
[13:45] but he had no arrows to shoot with the
[13:47] shoot and a crown was given unto him
[13:49] what his crown crown is recognition the
[13:52] recognition was given to him to go do
[13:54] what he's going to do remember he he who
[13:57] laid it will let until he be taken out
[13:59] the way right that's he who let it well
[14:02] that's Oh God let this happen to what to
[14:05] prove to Satan that he's God alright but
[14:09] watch this and I know you know this but
[14:14] we're going to go to everything James
[14:27] now watch games 19 thou believe is that
[14:32] there is one God that do as well I show
[14:39] me a Trinity in that there is none now
[14:42] believe is that there is one God what is
[14:45] the first commandment here the e 0
[14:47] Israel your God is one a man and Jesus
[14:55] said I come in my father's name while
[14:56] heating we don't call him father Bill
[14:58] with its Jesus Jesus Christ that's the
[15:02] only name God ever had with your Jesus
[15:04] Christ that's why we have to be baptized
[15:07] in it name now do as well but James tell
[15:10] us a little more the devil's also
[15:13] believe and tremble see there in that
[15:18] dimension of close enough to God to know
[15:20] that there's not three people sitting up
[15:22] there they've never seen three people
[15:26] but Satan their their head honcho send
[15:33] out an email one dance there's no this
[15:34] three you just can't see the other 2 i'm
[15:37] one of them says sleep that is no
[15:43] because look Satan is the second most
[15:45] spiritual person ever ever ever to be
[15:50] that's right God's one Lucifer was right
[15:54] next to God so he's the second most
[15:57] spiritual person in the world and any
[16:01] any dimension yeah that was perfect in
[16:06] Ezekiel that was perfect until an equity
[16:10] was founded what would come out iniquity
[16:12] product of iniquity we've done by the
[16:14] first sale right all right what is
[16:18] iniquity an equally is knowing that
[16:21] there's one guy and believe in three or
[16:26] even two okay
[16:29] but they're Devils also believe in
[16:31] trouble but then they filter down into
[16:35] this dimension 3 right they see where
[16:41] I'm going with this i hope this
[16:42] revelation of the first seal it's not
[16:46] only that the Antichrist is that white
[16:48] horse rider is the Antichrist but when
[16:52] brother instead when you see to one's
[16:54] got to be God one going to be the devil
[16:57] not three or four so when he says here
[17:01] stands a land with a book is hand and
[17:02] there goes the white horse rider there's
[17:05] God standing there and the devil is
[17:08] riding away from now that's what you
[17:09] want you want gun resist the devil and
[17:12] he will flee from you all right that's
[17:16] kind of a very short scripture but you
[17:18] know what it's one of those title
[17:19] prescriptions in the box in the bottom
[17:21] resist the devil and he will flee from
[17:24] you that's really hard it is hard cuz
[17:28] you know what we do we don't do that we
[17:31] don't resist him that's the problem so
[17:34] now through the ages man has proved that
[17:36] this scripture trying to find out saying
[17:39] that this was the Christ right me me me
[17:44] me me me me man commentary have told
[17:47] this even brother Adam in 1957 and 59
[17:50] priest the mighty conquer he read this
[17:52] scripture and called it the holy of now
[17:58] you say what you won't do but it was a
[18:01] firmament of Revelation when the seal
[18:03] open because he was getting ready to
[18:04] write the same notes I read it the other
[18:06] day in the steelbook page 109 I would
[18:09] have made a horrible mistake black he
[18:11] was riding the same notes he had brother
[18:14] mighty conference that this was the
[18:17] price not the Antichrist and you said
[18:21] we'll go that's that's horrible no it's
[18:23] not it's not horrible man if I find out
[18:27] I'm wrong but when I'm so deceived i
[18:32] think i'm right and i won't listen to
[18:34] somebody yeah that's worse cuz that
[18:39] light that i think i have has become the
[18:42] most gross darkness anyone ever had
[18:46] right bell grande para got 36 feet 10 i
[18:50] would have absolutely today and I hope
[18:52] people are spiritual so this is not just
[18:54] some goof up are happening gone planes
[18:59] this in this book place this in the
[19:01] prophets life for him to tell us about
[19:03] alright alright I want to win Hartley I
[19:07] hope that people are spirit I would have
[19:09] had have had a horrible mistake on that
[19:12] and that is capitalized in the book so
[19:15] they know what he was talking about the
[19:17] revelation of who this person was if it
[19:20] hadn't been about twelve o'clock when
[19:21] the Holy Spirit came in the room and
[19:22] corrected me on something that I was
[19:25] writing down say i was taking it from an
[19:29] old contact I had nothing on it so the
[19:32] Holy Spirit came right down and the
[19:34] whole thing opened up see that was the
[19:35] sealed opening to the Prophet what was
[19:38] it doing correcting error now even
[19:43] William Branham from the get-go he knew
[19:46] there was only one God he still was
[19:49] deceived by that one thing but when a
[19:53] sealed open vote Carolyn that seal open
[19:55] where did he see the white horse rider
[19:58] go he saw riding away from him yes we
[20:03] must see it riding away from us it'll do
[20:05] us no good to see that it rode away from
[20:08] brother Brown brother Dale or whoever
[20:10] you guys see it riding away from you
[20:13] that your error is being corrected to me
[20:18] that's the greatest opening on the seal
[20:19] what that does is that brings you up
[20:22] into a higher plane it brings you up
[20:24] into a level that I believe God can
[20:25] speak to you a little bit
[20:27] those remember God will speak to you but
[20:29] it will only speak to you by revelation
[20:31] he can't speak to you by error that's
[20:36] right he can't there's no way God can't
[20:39] do that that's my that's my brother and
[20:41] I will show you later when he saw that
[20:42] and remember that wasn't the only one if
[20:45] you go to the fifth seal he thought that
[20:48] sold under the altar was Christian
[20:50] people us and go ahead to correct him on
[20:53] that one no sold under the altar that's
[20:56] the Jews 26 in the half a million or 58
[20:59] mary 6 & 5 millions of Jews it was
[21:01] killed under i'm in a Hitler and abused
[21:02] it had held their testimony so you see
[21:06] then what we look we look at me said one
[21:08] good that doesn't mean anything yeah it
[21:12] does you know what he does it drives
[21:14] that unclean this out if I'm not unclean
[21:17] yeah in your spirit realm right now
[21:18] you're not clean you only had my have
[21:23] bad thoughts a day well then your spirit
[21:29] round up clean
[21:34] ewie memory reason we reason own things
[21:37] we shouldn't conscious imagination oh
[21:43] boy don't we imagine stuff Yeah right
[21:51] affection that affection in that in that
[21:55] realm there God has to come through that
[21:58] figlio love to bring that agape love to
[22:01] you got it we think filial love is so
[22:05] wonderful and it is God give us enough
[22:08] of that love down here to love each
[22:09] other love her wife and all these things
[22:11] right but there's something brother
[22:14] Brown said it goes further further
[22:15] further when he went across the curtain
[22:17] time he was telling that in the adoption
[22:19] theory when he went across the curtain
[22:21] time he said it's just perfection he
[22:23] said it's just something that you just
[22:24] don't know anything about don't leave
[22:26] not been there but we already charl
[22:28] creatures inside and I think it once in
[22:30] a while God allows it to raise up every
[22:33] watch sitting in heavenly places right
[22:35] in Christ Jesus and let's just be real
[22:39] honest eighty percent of our life is
[22:41] spent sleeping and doing worldly things
[22:44] and i'm not saying worldly things like
[22:45] where I'm talking about work sleep work
[22:48] parenting husband wife family yeah I
[22:54] don't get with just a little bit bro yup
[22:56] nothing get a lot but you know what
[22:58] though we must focus that little bit of
[23:01] time that we do now right and let God
[23:04] have that time yes just waiting have
[23:06] that time because he listened staying
[23:09] about this elevator ah sometimes I think
[23:14] we don't think God knows everything and
[23:16] I'm not saying hiding stuff I'm just
[23:18] saying you know you do something you and
[23:20] you know you goof up for you do
[23:22] something you know just a Oh God forgive
[23:24] me and you know he's like aw he is going
[23:26] to do that 10 billion years ago i'm no
[23:28] you know what now what you gonna do that
[23:31] okay I know what you're going to do
[23:33] about but you don't know what you
[23:34] right right but he know he knows the
[23:37] whole thing well I said this Bible
[23:40] perfect in the prophets message is
[23:41] perfect we must rely on that because if
[23:45] we're going to go to perfection it's got
[23:47] to all come back to that it can't go to
[23:50] the denomination or an idea that's what
[23:52] these sales report it's driving out all
[23:54] that uncleanness general you remember
[23:57] sister Sheppard's dream you saw when I
[24:00] got the Holy go back on everything why
[24:03] does sister Sheppard have a dream that
[24:04] that trash was coming out of the pyramid
[24:07] remember the pyramid and talk about it
[24:09] the water was running out and it had
[24:12] trash in it and brother Graham said she
[24:15] was asking what is she was born again or
[24:17] not young ground said yes you're born
[24:19] again but the trash was still coming out
[24:22] right so we still have trash well if you
[24:28] if you don't pray for me I did trash in
[24:34] trash out like you computer-guided you
[24:37] no good in good out bad in bat out you
[24:40] know and I behold a white behold and I
[24:45] saw behold a white horse he was telling
[24:48] how to vote crown was given unto them
[24:49] went forth conquering and to conquer
[24:52] what was he conquering with brother
[24:54] Brown even goes and shows that what
[24:57] influence I don't you can't see this but
[25:00] there's third age ended at six of six
[25:03] right that 606 was the Nicene council
[25:07] that took the let me say their
[25:11] revelation that Jesus was a light
[25:14] substance of God not these systems can
[25:16] go so that in turn made him a Trinity
[25:19] then they say well obviously there's got
[25:22] to be a holy ghost in there somewhere so
[25:24] let's make it three people three persons
[25:26] in the Godhead father son go go right
[25:29] what's the next age the next day just
[25:32] the Catholic age the prophet of God said
[25:34] the Dark Ages when Catholics rude is
[25:36] they dragged the longest a complete
[25:38] something
[25:39] 15 20 foot cross the daughter back and
[25:42] kill people for not believing their
[25:43] doctrine who was that with that God
[25:47] because we're fixing to get to where he
[25:49] jumped on this horse when he jumps on
[25:53] that horse we come into this age right
[25:56] but this horse doesn't stop this horse
[26:01] keeps going the seal ends just like a
[26:07] stair-step we've talked about the steel
[26:08] ends and the National come from the
[26:10] second seal it's what first thing is
[26:14] ready all right read what happened in
[26:17] that age 68 million Protestants were
[26:20] killed blood physically brother ever
[26:24] said no telling how many spiritual died
[26:27] during that time right there when the
[26:29] Catholic try to call dark when the
[26:31] Catholics took over but let's continue
[26:33] with this just for a second wild horse
[26:36] bow and a crown and concrete when he
[26:39] concur with that was one thing he
[26:41] concurred with he split got up so we
[26:46] thought this was God yeah at first we
[26:52] thought this was God and all the
[26:53] glorious things is going on the devil
[26:57] was hit right in there in the Word of
[27:00] God right cuz that he right there is not
[27:05] God that he is the Antichrist amen and
[27:10] he's being revealed he can only be
[27:14] revealed are made known by God being
[27:18] revealed in you that there's only one
[27:19] done because that's what the worst
[27:22] problem they had was the one God and you
[27:28] say well what a quiet 11 God's real
[27:31] simple listen 1 God's the whole message
[27:36] yes because that revelation comes from
[27:38] one God that's the true revelation then
[27:44] if you get something this contrary to
[27:46] that it's the devil I mean it's just
[27:47] like black and white in any ain't no
[27:49] gray area it's either from God all right
[27:52] either comes from the belt there's no
[27:55] in-between that's great you're either
[27:58] sitting on that horse within our he's
[28:03] riding away from you and when he rides
[28:06] away brother right he's gone as far as
[28:10] that revelation is concerned so that's
[28:11] why said about one good and one god it's
[28:14] like runnin l said you take one gun you
[28:16] say well water baptism different oh no
[28:18] it's not the true if you get a true
[28:22] revelation there's only one true and
[28:23] living God in Jesus Christ it is named
[28:25] there's only one way to be baptized then
[28:27] that's in the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[28:29] rather father's not a name son's not a
[28:32] name whole notes is not named they're
[28:33] not an anger of towels to that one man
[28:36] Jesus Christ great that guy right there
[28:41] the lamb right
[28:47] but it's all on the radio now that said
[28:50] it'd be roar like a lion but he bled
[28:51] like a lamb and that's good then it's
[28:54] true he roared like a lot of everything
[28:56] he said was exactly the truth he said
[28:59] haha coaches agree he said what I told
[29:02] you the truth well he went right he
[29:04] never lied her name is life okay so that
[29:09] was the pure lamb that opened the seal
[29:12] so where has he got to be to open it he
[29:14] can't be out there and he can't be in
[29:17] brother so and so whoever you put in a
[29:19] brother school brother Dale pastors of
[29:21] the church you got me in you he got be
[29:25] in you you've got to see the revelation
[29:28] of what this seal opening produces
[29:31] because it's got to produce something
[29:33] yet listen it has not produced a rapture
[29:37] yet but it will that's why those seals
[29:42] brother Brown said I'm worked in many
[29:45] rounds what about a land that stood in
[29:47] front of in India and saw a hundred
[29:50] thousand people be healed a hundred
[29:54] thousand there's not that many hundred
[29:56] thousand people in the whole city of
[29:57] gainesville in hall county yeah that's a
[30:01] hundred thousand people instant healing
[30:04] several thousand received Christ as
[30:06] Savior he said I've never worked in a
[30:09] realm spirit around like a word with a
[30:12] steel flat heathens temporary
[30:16] salvation can mean salvation but if you
[30:19] don't go on then what happened to those
[30:21] people they went right back into the
[30:22] churches number got saved that's okay
[30:26] but they never grew because they had
[30:29] nothing to grow with this is why this is
[30:32] the growth part of your development of
[30:34] the Christian Right it's okay to drink
[30:38] milk milk is all right I like a good
[30:41] cold glass of milk every once in one but
[30:44] I don't like it every day for every meal
[30:46] every time I come to church I don't want
[30:49] to drink milk okay because from the
[30:52] Bible's they posted your unskillful see
[30:56] brother branham skillful with the word
[30:59] he was a prophet he knew what he was
[31:02] talking about now he had his own idea of
[31:04] this because other content but when God
[31:07] opened that up to him see to me that's
[31:10] why that spiritual he came into a great
[31:12] around because he knew them one thing
[31:14] was for sure God was right there he
[31:18] wasn't off somewhere else he he was
[31:20] right there right cuz look let me ask
[31:24] you this question now brother branham I
[31:27] just read a parent page 109 in them in
[31:29] the steelbook brother I've said the Holy
[31:31] Spirit came in the room I thought the
[31:34] Holy Spirit was inside up he is holy
[31:39] ghost filled brother now I'm telling you
[31:41] he had the Holy Ghost Dance old man but
[31:45] that was a different anointing you saw
[31:47] yeah that's a different anointing you
[31:48] get an anointing for preaching you got
[31:50] anointing for him you got him only for
[31:51] this you got an auntie for that right
[31:53] different anointing and like he would be
[31:57] he would be praying for the sick or
[32:00] getting ready to pray for the sick well
[32:01] that's good profit a man offensive Son
[32:03] of God standing there saying I'm waiting
[32:05] on him
[32:06] what was he waiting though he was
[32:09] waiting on an anointing to come that he
[32:11] knew what it would bring her when he
[32:15] came ok same way with that angel but at
[32:19] Angel would come into the room and talk
[32:22] to him show em Scripture but remember
[32:26] that angel that spoke to brother round
[32:30] never revealed one thing doing it had to
[32:37] ring in here first it had a ran in here
[32:40] yes watch because he'd say the angel
[32:44] came in the room and then he'd spent all
[32:46] day looking at skechers one out if you
[32:49] and I be honest we're setting up
[32:50] studying we're praying and work we're
[32:53] meditating on something and all of a
[32:54] sudden a man walks through the wall
[32:57] walks in the room and he's standing
[33:00] there and he said I'm an annual company
[33:02] night number one you'd be scared to
[33:05] death but number two what if he said
[33:10] when I want you to go out today and I
[33:12] want you to preach father son Holy Ghost
[33:14] is the correct baptism now for ninety
[33:19] percent of people in the world world
[33:21] they would net they just dead run out
[33:24] they'd hit the pull pin say an angel
[33:26] walk through the law I told me what to
[33:29] say to you not a holy ghost feeling
[33:33] person that's not somebody skillful in
[33:36] the word that can cut the meat right
[33:38] sharper than a two-edged story to divide
[33:41] between the soul and spirit goes
[33:43] remember that that that angel came to
[33:46] the
[33:46] was it so hard Martin hema st. Martin
[33:51] and said I'm God worship me there was
[33:53] something wrong Martin's holy goes there
[33:55] was a little tough one envelope someone
[33:58] offensive huh you have a crime on your
[34:00] head word posed to crown you when this
[34:03] thing's over get out of here Satan right
[34:06] but why did that the Holy Ghost his
[34:08] filter this filter came up and gave him
[34:11] a revelation of what that was same way
[34:13] brother Brennan a revelation came up in
[34:15] him the Holy Spirit came into room and
[34:18] and I don't I wasn't there but he said
[34:22] he corrected him what he was going to
[34:24] preach see the angel could have said
[34:27] well brother ground when he breathed
[34:30] what he'd been preaching all your lap
[34:32] one true and living God in Jesus is his
[34:34] name and that Holy Ghost sinful that's
[34:39] another person
[34:45] that's another person
[34:49] the wheels go turning into profits head
[34:52] well if that's another person and tool
[34:54] antelope of the seal and that person
[34:56] riding away that's two people right go
[35:02] right back to your foundation if this is
[35:06] god that's got to be a different person
[35:08] fellow he calls him a fellow a lot that
[35:12] fellow that person why they don't give
[35:14] him any honor he just is there somebody
[35:16] seems Adele hiding and brother Brown
[35:21] says he corrected me on what I was
[35:23] getting ready free so so high what I
[35:25] what I'm telling you is is you can have
[35:27] the bathroom the Holy Ghost but there is
[35:29] an anointing that will come and it will
[35:31] teach you something man the inside
[35:34] teacher is the inside teacher but you
[35:37] gotta hear it from another listen if we
[35:39] if we believe the way we believe that
[35:42] every time another vesicle brother dale
[35:45] bro Louise aaron any of us stand up and
[35:48] preach and we preach the true Word of
[35:49] God that is the holy ghost speaking to
[35:51] you all right but now remember the only
[35:56] thing about brother Brennan was
[35:57] different is it's because the Prophet
[35:59] answers to nobody but God see the profit
[36:03] that God talked to the prophet the
[36:05] prophet delivers it does so nobody could
[36:08] get between brother random and God God
[36:10] had to come and deliver that revelation
[36:13] to the Prophet himself when you know
[36:16] what I'm saying no preacher came in
[36:18] between that's it brother Ram you're
[36:19] wrong there's no preacher Patel brother
[36:21] around me was wrong God is young 1 for
[36:23] telling it was wrong yeah then the
[36:25] filter comes down to the pastors
[36:28] teachers evangelist and all that to give
[36:31] it to you and I so we get it the same
[36:33] way brother Ram guy we listen to the
[36:36] Holy up we listen to what the only those
[36:38] headphones
[36:39] man that's the same thing i mean same
[36:42] thing happened what's correcting in our
[36:44] error the Holy Ghost is speaking to us
[36:46] through profit Patrick T that even your
[36:49] sister center on top brother right then
[36:54] so it's not so far what I'm saying it's
[36:57] not so far-fetched things that happened
[36:59] to brother round two things that happen
[37:00] to us it just happens in a little
[37:02] different way the holy ghost came into a
[37:05] little brother round of corrected equine
[37:06] nobody else can correct the problem but
[37:09] now we take what the Prophet said and
[37:13] then you know these people that put
[37:15] polygamy in to sold and seven
[37:17] Thunderbirds users all that they didn't
[37:19] get that from here they didn't come with
[37:23] a problem right so in between their step
[37:28] somebody and you know what they've done
[37:31] they accepted it instead of rejecting it
[37:34] brother brown rejected that old doctrine
[37:38] and it went away from riding away he
[37:43] went forth conquering and conquer what
[37:46] others maybe we read Matthew behold I'm
[37:50] Christ it's over here let's go over here
[37:52] behold crisis in the desert behold
[37:55] Christ is he if crisis in you you don't
[37:59] have to go to death
[38:03] because you know what they're gonna
[38:05] they're gonna try to lead you away whose
[38:07] day that he and his Devils they're gonna
[38:11] try to lead you away from that's why i
[38:14] said if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[38:15] you will be the same and you are all
[38:17] ready to see you don't have the bathroom
[38:20] the homeless in your soul you still can
[38:22] be too safe oh yeah you can't y'all you
[38:25] know you had a little a little bit of
[38:27] that last way for you yes you can't be
[38:29] too safe brother Brad wants to see right
[38:32] Martin Luther was to see by this
[38:35] brighter not enough word to get that out
[38:39] but when you come to the fullness of
[38:40] this word that got everything out
[38:43] everything out in the open that's what I
[38:45] said to me the seals are open in plain
[38:47] view but if you say their clothes you
[38:50] shut it right up you shut the book you
[38:53] shut the book bank but one man can show
[38:56] the book and open the book when Jesus
[38:58] walked in that temple that Danny said
[38:59] this danger scripture fulfilled about
[39:01] the city shows the book and handed it
[39:03] back to the preacher he's the owner but
[39:06] when you come revelation 6 open then you
[39:10] go to revelations 10 the book is open
[39:12] all right why is it open its open
[39:15] because there's a revelation in there
[39:16] that Satan is the anti-christ but
[39:24] there's one true and living God and
[39:25] Jesus Christ is his name and that to me
[39:29] is a revelation of that first seal you
[39:31] got to get that foundation right first
[39:33] cuz everything is built on the
[39:35] revelation one trail in the dark because
[39:37] even the devil's believe it and then
[39:40] they feed it to you that this tree what
[39:43] iniquity what a deception see that to me
[39:45] that's the highest form of nickel be
[39:47] there is it's for a spiritual being to
[39:50] look at the Creator that created them
[39:53] turn around and feed it to the people
[39:55] that there's three and Hempstead
[39:57] one and you say oh that's way up
[40:01] Gunderson nice working in your spirit
[40:04] realm every day you say well I don't
[40:07] have a problem with one God it may not
[40:09] be just wondering maybe a lot of other
[40:11] things got it so this first feel is that
[40:15] rider rides off what is it doing it's
[40:18] made us to the part that the lamb stands
[40:25] here with the book in his hand now
[40:26] that's not baby form justification we'll
[40:29] talk about that next Sunday because we
[40:30] got to put them we got to put the
[40:32] redemption in the seal right so we have
[40:35] to put justification sans kitchen
[40:36] bathroom hold off into the seal all
[40:38] right so what's the greatest form of
[40:40] justification the real you didn't do it
[40:42] right the real you never done it and
[40:45] that rides off from you the louie is
[40:52] justified he's already going funny
[40:54] that's all right glory in your
[40:58] justification that God has justified you
[41:00] and if you don't have a problem sound
[41:03] telling you one God if you don't have a
[41:04] problem with that slide it over to the
[41:06] side and lay it down and make a
[41:07] foundation and build everything up for
[41:08] company all right we'll talk just a
[41:10] little bit more on the first field next
[41:12] sunday then we go to sexy let's go
[41:17] you
