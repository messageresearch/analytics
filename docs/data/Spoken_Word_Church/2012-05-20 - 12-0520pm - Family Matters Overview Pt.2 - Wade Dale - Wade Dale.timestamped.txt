[28:18] 1-7 likewise you wives be in subjection
[28:21] to your own husbands now we're going to
[28:23] get into that a little bit this
[28:24] afternoon then if any obey not the word
[28:27] they also May without the word be won by
[28:30] the conversation of the wives why
[28:32] because the wives is where you can see
[28:34] it
[28:35] at you physically can see it from the
[28:38] wives us I mean I look like a regular
[28:40] guy you know of course people this day
[28:42] and time have tattoos all the way up
[28:44] their arms and earrings in their ears
[28:46] and you know you know weird junk like
[28:49] that but um but we are a little we are
[28:52] supposed to be different in our
[28:53] mannerism but the wife really shows it a
[28:56] Pure Clean
[28:58] woman I mean my what a what a testimony
[29:02] and see without even reading the word of
[29:04] God when they walk by yeah without even
[29:06] reading the word without the word be one
[29:08] by the conversation of the wise while
[29:10] they behold your Chase conversation
[29:13] coupled with fear whose adorning let it
[29:14] not be of the outward adorning of
[29:16] platting of hair and of wearing of gold
[29:17] and putting on of apparel Let It Be The
[29:19] Hidden man of the heart and that which
[29:21] is not corruptible even the ornament of
[29:23] a meek and quiet Spirit who is in the
[29:25] sight of God of great price for after
[29:27] this man in the old times the holy women
[29:29] also who trusted in God adorned
[29:30] themselves being in subjection unto
[29:32] their own husband even as Sarah obeyed
[29:34] Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters
[29:36] you are as long as you do well and are
[29:39] not afraid with any amazement likewise
[29:41] your husbands dwell with them according
[29:43] to knowledge we going to get into that
[29:45] today a little
[29:46] bit excuse me giving honor unto the wife
[29:49] as unto the weaker vessel and as being
[29:51] heirs together of the grace of life that
[29:54] your prayers be not hindered you may be
[29:57] seated the Lord and his BL lessons to
[29:58] the reading the word we're going to read
[30:00] that quote and I really actually forgot
[30:03] that I think they pulled it up on the U
[30:06] computer if you would pull that first
[30:07] one up brother Anderson said he was just
[30:09] going to scroll them he wasn't going to
[30:10] he was just going to scroll them and let
[30:11] me keep reading
[30:15] so Anderson got big old fingers back
[30:18] there he got long fingers and he can
[30:19] reach and get that button cuz you got to
[30:21] realize every time I say something and
[30:22] every time I want a quote to pop up they
[30:24] got to get it on the computer and
[30:26] they've got to hit this thing right here
[30:28] make it come up on the screen then they
[30:30] have to scroll it with their other hand
[30:32] to uh to get it to where we can read it
[30:34] so it's not just sitting back there
[30:36] pushing buttons you know they're they're
[30:38] at it pretty uh you know pretty well
[30:40] they're kind of the captain of the ship
[30:42] that you don't see you know they're
[30:44] actually running the show I just give
[30:46] them the information and they put it up
[30:47] on the
[30:48] screen look at adoption each the lamb
[30:51] was provided and divied up by
[30:52] inspiration and each one I can take the
[30:54] scriptures and show it to you exactly
[30:56] that he put them in the place where they
[30:57] were supposed to be now what's he
[30:58] talking about the positionally placing
[30:59] of the Israelites in the what land of
[31:02] Canaan all right positionally how the 2
[31:05] and A2 tribes stayed across the river
[31:06] how their mothers cried in their birth
[31:08] and how that each place was supposed to
[31:09] be and now after you are
[31:12] in what is the promised land type of
[31:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost right all
[31:17] right and after you're in that don't
[31:19] mean that you're out free from war
[31:21] everybody read that you still have to
[31:23] fight for every inch of ground you stand
[31:26] on so see Canaan did did not represent
[31:28] the great Heaven because it's war and
[31:30] troubles and killings and fightings and
[31:32] so forth but it did represent this that
[31:34] it must be a perfect walk right and
[31:37] there's where the church is failing
[31:39] today on that
[31:41] walk not that we don't know everything
[31:44] not that we don't have all the knowledge
[31:45] we've got all the tapes we've got all
[31:47] the books there's not any hidden secrets
[31:49] there's no Hidden Mysteries where the
[31:51] church is failing today on that walk do
[31:54] you know that even your own behavior can
[31:55] knock somebody else out and get it
[31:56] healed you're Miss behavior of
[31:58] unconfessed Sins Of You
[32:01] Believers didn't say unbelievers did it
[32:04] Believers am can cause this church to
[32:07] bitterly fail and at the day of the
[32:08] Judgment you'll be responsible for every
[32:10] bit of it oh you say now wait a minute
[32:12] brother Brenham well that's the truth
[32:14] think of it and he's talking about
[32:15] Joshua remember Joshua how about an army
[32:17] that went
[32:18] across fought the Hittites and the
[32:21] amorites and they didn't even need a
[32:23] scratch they didn't need a nurse or
[32:25] first aid or Band-Aid they didn't even
[32:27] need a Red Cross
[32:30] they lost nobody in the battle and it
[32:33] was hand to hand combat it wasn't
[32:35] shooting somebody from 400 yard away it
[32:37] was hand toand
[32:39] combat but God told him if you'll do
[32:41] what I say you'll never lose a battle
[32:44] amen you'll never lose a man right then
[32:46] what happened when aching come in and
[32:48] sin came in Camp what happened
[32:51] automatically what was it 20 people or
[32:53] something like that automatically killed
[32:55] Joshua knew there was a problem
[32:56] somewhere he called an assembly we going
[32:58] find out what this problem is all right
[33:00] so maybe we ought to do that a little
[33:02] more
[33:03] often we're not trying to get rid of
[33:05] people we're trying to get rid of
[33:06] problems right right same way this is
[33:09] what I'm doing with this trying to get
[33:10] rid of problems trying to trying to look
[33:13] you know look for the train wreck that's
[33:14] coming right get rid of the train you
[33:16] know get the trains on the right track
[33:18] so they don't run into each other all
[33:19] right so now we're talking
[33:22] here yeah this is it but where we had
[33:24] the double Covenant everybody understand
[33:27] we had one Covenant Y Man and female
[33:30] male and female co-equal now we've come
[33:32] to where Eve did what she did Adam Adam
[33:35] wasn't out here so holy and Pi he took
[33:37] him her sin right all right but God then
[33:40] put him under a covenant and said hey
[33:43] you because you're the weaker vessel
[33:45] because you look at the emotional side
[33:48] you look at the you know things like
[33:50] that and and you're different from the
[33:51] man and this is what happened through
[33:53] you right here's what's going we're
[33:55] going to do now notice after the
[33:56] beginning after the beginning the time
[33:58] again back in that was eternity is
[34:01] over now eternity is not over but he was
[34:04] talking about the eternity is over as
[34:05] far as we are concerned cuz we have to
[34:07] drop down into time all right notice
[34:10] after that fall was made by Eve after
[34:11] the fall there would need to be another
[34:13] covenant made now this is going to
[34:15] stumble you but I'm going to give you
[34:16] scripture to prove that is the truth now
[34:17] notice after the fall Jesus said God at
[34:20] the beginning made one of a kind but now
[34:22] after the fall now we're going beyond
[34:24] that the Covenant was co-equal but now
[34:26] after the fall there's another Covenant
[34:27] made now she is no longer ruler with him
[34:30] each must have a separate Covenant we
[34:33] were talking outside brother Collins and
[34:35] and dad were talking your sisters you
[34:39] think that we beat on the women and and
[34:41] all but you're a type of us right you're
[34:44] a type of Christ in the church right
[34:47] right that's right so we look at brother
[34:50] rown said what look at the women you'll
[34:52] see how the religious world's acting
[34:54] right all right so you have a standard
[34:57] that you you can hold yourself I mean
[34:59] you don't have to preach you don't have
[35:02] we you don't have to give an account for
[35:03] our
[35:06] stupidity right but we got to give an
[35:08] account for what you do
[35:11] right sisters ought to say praise the
[35:15] Lord that's right thank
[35:17] you but
[35:20] remember if you stay in your position
[35:22] that's where God needs you to be that's
[35:23] where you ought to be and that's where
[35:25] God saw you you needed to be and made
[35:27] that position for you amen amen God made
[35:31] that position for you okay remember
[35:34] brother Benny and sister Brenda they're
[35:36] traveling on their way to Savannah I
[35:37] just saw them missing over here and uh
[35:41] just remember them as they travel
[35:42] they're going to take a little vacation
[35:44] time which is not bad at all take a
[35:46] vacation all right now First
[35:49] Corinthians I don't mind this scrolling
[35:51] part I told him I said I'll just start
[35:53] reading and you just keep
[35:55] scrolling 1 Corinthians 11:3 but I would
[35:57] have you know that the head of every man
[35:59] is Christ and the head of the woman is
[36:02] the man and the head of Christ is God so
[36:04] there's your order we saw that last time
[36:07] when we were talking about this now
[36:09] let's go to 14
[36:13] a but now look I'm going to read this
[36:15] again just to leave that right there but
[36:16] I want you to know that but I would have
[36:18] you know that the head of every man is
[36:20] Christ now when we give oursel over to
[36:23] Christ what do we do we take on the name
[36:25] of Jesus Christ amen all right
[36:28] so we've lost our name we're not
[36:29] actually actually June June Thomas
[36:32] doesn't exist anymore right she doesn't
[36:36] right it's nowhere on the record that
[36:38] she exist oh sure back when she was born
[36:40] but I'm talking about after she married
[36:42] me she and I it's June Dale right right
[36:46] there's no other June Thomas anywhere
[36:49] that hadn't come back up that's dead
[36:51] it's gone right cuz remember like Dad
[36:54] said you you got to if you're still
[36:57] married to somebody else and try to be
[36:58] married to Christ you're an adultery
[37:00] yeah so your old name your old husband
[37:04] your old Nature's got to be dead right
[37:06] right dead but you see first decisions
[37:09] made next engagement then promise right
[37:13] and then the ceremony and that's when
[37:14] the bride takes the bridegroom's name
[37:16] she is no more than of her own name she
[37:19] takes the bridegroom's name all right
[37:22] 14b and I'm like that I want to make
[37:25] make it clear that I will not ever do a
[37:27] marriage ceremony if the girl wants to
[37:29] keep her made name cuz that means that
[37:32] she's not submitted herself right right
[37:34] to the husband
[37:38] all is't that right right that's the
[37:41] whole thing you're not submitting your
[37:42] whole self you're doing what daddy said
[37:45] you're taking some of the old you and
[37:47] just sticking it over here in the closet
[37:48] so I can reach over here and get it when
[37:50] I need it that's right but if the old me
[37:53] broy is dead or the old June Thomas is
[37:55] dead there's no more June Thomas anymore
[37:57] she's not even known as Jim Thomas she's
[38:00] Jim d right she's never more nobody ever
[38:04] called her Jim Thomas even her family
[38:05] they know she married me she took on my
[38:07] name all right and you know what she can
[38:11] have my protection because she's took on
[38:13] my
[38:15] name right you're not protected if you
[38:18] don't have your husband's name right are
[38:21] you protected in Christ if you don't
[38:22] have his
[38:24] name I don't think so so you got the
[38:27] only protection that your wife has I say
[38:29] the only when it comes to certain things
[38:32] is that she submitted her name to you
[38:34] giving up that part of her life married
[38:37] to you now you know what men you know
[38:39] what you've done women you've said here
[38:42] you're responsible for me
[38:44] yeah right if you fully given everything
[38:47] vows and everything you fully given
[38:49] yourself to your husband you're saying
[38:51] here right that's right you're taking
[38:54] care of me now right amen you're my
[38:56] protection
[38:59] right but if you're
[39:02] not you're not protected right then
[39:06] another thing after she was taking all
[39:07] those vows and so forth and the ceremony
[39:09] has been said like my wife's name was
[39:11] Bry before she was married now she is no
[39:14] longer a br she is brandom now she isn't
[39:17] no more Bry she is brandom same thing
[39:20] when you come into Christ you're no more
[39:21] of the world you're of Christ you care
[39:24] not for the things of the world that's
[39:25] what we're supposed to be that's one our
[39:27] problem is like we read there it's in
[39:29] our walk the things that we do in
[39:32] life we got to get away from these
[39:34] things don't try to live on the border
[39:37] get away from them same way with even
[39:41] looking for a for a spouse or even or
[39:44] even continuing on in the marriage that
[39:45] you're in we've still got to look at
[39:48] these things and say
[39:50] hey I don't want to be right on the line
[39:54] I want to be so far away from the line
[39:56] so the line I can't even see the line
[39:58] right all right I want to be away from
[40:00] that I don't know why in the world we
[40:02] want to keep playing around and you know
[40:04] what I thought the other day and I'm
[40:05] just going to say it uh Daddy's preached
[40:08] y'all for 40 years and you hadn't
[40:09] listened to him I wondered why y'all
[40:11] listen didn't listen to some of the
[40:12] things I said cuz some of you women
[40:14] still run your husbands around some of
[40:15] you people say things you shouldn't say
[40:17] and all that and I thought well if I
[40:20] hadn't done it for him in 40 years why
[40:22] you think he going to do it for me in
[40:23] about 10 so sorry that's just the way it
[40:26] is but some will and some won't we're
[40:28] not all
[40:30] made to be to where we can change and
[40:34] I'm sorry for that but you know what
[40:36] brother Bram said we're sitting I told
[40:37] him up in in Tennessee brother Bram said
[40:40] you're sitting on top of a razor right
[40:44] remember he said that you're sitting on
[40:46] top of a razor blade every doesn't
[40:48] matter how thin that razor blade
[40:51] is it's made like
[40:54] this right yeah and you're sitting right
[40:57] on top of it he said if you go off one
[41:00] side or the other he said there's
[41:02] absolutely no way to get back because if
[41:04] you start off this way you're going to
[41:07] just keep going right right once you get
[41:10] off once you fall and go down the only
[41:13] way is you got to come back and get back
[41:15] up on the edge again and that's where it
[41:17] what
[41:18] cuts that's the problem with us and
[41:20] that's a problem with most of us is we
[41:21] don't like change and we don't want to
[41:23] change but you know what if you don't
[41:24] change then you just go to an early
[41:26] grave
[41:28] Fellowship this was a purpose for
[41:30] marriage let's look at this for just a
[41:39] second Bob wake
[41:41] up scroll scroll
[41:45] brother Fellowship pray or marriage have
[41:48] to wake them up up after I bragged on
[41:51] y'all look what you did Fellowship the
[41:53] is the for was the first purpose of
[41:56] marriage now brother BR said in choosing
[41:58] of a bride when God gave him man a wife
[42:01] he gave him the best thing he could give
[42:03] him outside of salvation but when one
[42:06] goes to try to take a man's place then
[42:08] she's about the worst thing he could get
[42:10] a hold of right now see we can see that
[42:14] we can see the spiritual application all
[42:17] right so let's go to the next one let's
[42:19] go to
[42:20] uh this note I want you to see this note
[42:24] God had to separate him in flesh that's
[42:26] what he had to do had to separate Adam
[42:28] and Eve now I'm taking some I'm
[42:29] paraphrasing some of the things that
[42:30] brother Bram said and kind of put them
[42:32] together I hope you don't mind but it
[42:35] kind of keeps from having to read the
[42:37] whole quote God had to separate them in
[42:39] flesh in order to join them together in
[42:41] the fellowship of marriage in other
[42:42] words Adam and Eve couldn't produce Adam
[42:44] while Eve was still inside of Adam right
[42:48] Eve had to come out of Adam there had to
[42:50] be a separation before there could be
[42:52] Fellowship all right Adam and Eve were
[42:54] not made to be two separate individuals
[42:56] with each pursuing their own individual
[42:58] life they
[43:00] weren't rather they were two individuals
[43:02] placed in a relationship as one flesh to
[43:04] fellowship with each other and with God
[43:07] that was the intention and that's what
[43:08] we're getting back to all right we come
[43:11] down here to be individuals and do the
[43:13] things that we do as individuals but now
[43:14] up there we're going to be individuals
[43:16] we know that but the fellowship part was
[43:18] was for us to Fellowship back to God
[43:21] right that's the part we got to
[43:23] Fellowship back to God God wants our
[43:25] fellowship as a married couple as well
[43:27] as with us as individuals all right keep
[43:32] going Genesis 2:18 God gave us a want to
[43:35] help meet remember we went back and give
[43:37] you the definition which is one suitable
[43:40] for him one to meet that's why it says
[43:43] help meet not mate help meet one to meet
[43:48] his need for Fellowship right that's
[43:52] what we're talking about downstairs and
[43:53] we kind of laugh about it but you know
[43:56] if Jun said she could do without me if I
[43:58] passed away but I couldn't do without
[44:00] her I don't think I'd have to have
[44:02] Fellowship I'm sorry I'm you know but
[44:03] what are you doing it's that call it's
[44:07] that call in your in your in your human
[44:09] life that you need fellowship with
[44:11] somebody but I will make him and help me
[44:13] for him God said it is not good for the
[44:16] man to be alone in other words he don't
[44:17] want that to happen I will make him a
[44:19] help me all right let's keep
[44:23] going but now remember this is where the
[44:27] Fellowship was broken when when God
[44:29] comes to Adam and said I heard thy voice
[44:31] in the garden and I was what afraid to
[44:33] me that's a very striking thing because
[44:36] the fellowship was broke by fear Adam
[44:38] had no problem speaking to God before
[44:40] this he had no problem walking right
[44:41] straight up to God and fellowshipping
[44:43] with God had nothing in his mind that
[44:45] was wrong but now when this happened
[44:48] first thing he said I heard you calling
[44:50] me and I was afraid all right in other
[44:53] words I was I had fear all right and
[44:56] what what does Fear do let's keep going
[44:59] brother afraid why he walked among the
[45:02] Beast Etc but because of Sin unconfessed
[45:05] Sin breaks Fellowship right he didn't
[45:09] confess
[45:10] right Adam never confessed to God and
[45:13] said I'm sorry right he said it was a
[45:15] woman you gave me right all right but
[45:19] what did fear bring jealousy Pride doubt
[45:21] anxiety and worry that's the problem
[45:23] with all of us we've got all these
[45:25] things in there of fear
[45:28] right but why did Jesus always say fear
[45:30] not when he appeared he's bringing us
[45:31] right back to the fellowship that Jesus
[45:35] I'm going to say Jesus Jesus didn't have
[45:36] to say to Adam and Eve fear not right no
[45:40] he just come down in the cool of the day
[45:42] Adam and Eve walked up there and met him
[45:44] and they just just like me and Dad was
[45:46] set in fellowship with each other but
[45:48] when something came in between
[45:50] them Adam says I was afraid what I was
[45:54] afraid of what God was going to do to me
[45:57] right so I just went and put some
[46:00] clothes on or I just went and you know
[46:02] did this or or you know I went in bushes
[46:05] and started having church but why did
[46:07] Jesus always say fear not when he
[46:09] appeared cuz he wanted to reestablish
[46:10] that he was the second Adam right but he
[46:12] wanted to reestablish the
[46:14] fellowship that the first Adam and Eve
[46:16] had with God so establish Fellowship
[46:19] between you and your mate that's the
[46:20] same thing here on Earth praying
[46:23] together stops a lot of arguments yeah
[46:25] communicate with each other
[46:27] financially don't do it by text or email
[46:31] but financially or any of those you can
[46:33] use but communicate with your
[46:36] spouse communicate with your spouse yeah
[46:39] I mean that's
[46:42] just what hurts more
[46:45] sisters the silent treatment or just go
[46:49] ahead and talking the silent treatment
[46:53] huh the silent treatment yeah that hurts
[46:56] worse than anything
[46:57] the silent
[46:59] treatment just talk about it I mean
[47:01] that's your that's your bone your bone
[47:03] and flesh your flesh talk about it
[47:05] relationship now watch what is the first
[47:07] like the water of Separation the first
[47:09] is the first course the kitchen where
[47:11] you come and eat you feed in the kitchen
[47:13] when you come to church and you feed on
[47:14] the word oh don't you love the word
[47:16] feeding on the word that's the first
[47:17] place then in the next place you enter
[47:19] into kind of a relationship of this type
[47:21] that you embrace your wife you stand
[47:23] there maybe in the Parlor and she's
[47:25] taking off her bail and you put your arm
[47:27] around her you tell her you love her and
[47:29] that she's going to be the most darling
[47:31] wife in all the world and how that you
[47:33] love her and how you going to be loyal
[47:34] to your your marriage Val and so forth
[47:37] you've done had your little Feast the
[47:39] wedding feast and now you entered into
[47:40] tell her in the Parlor you set her down
[47:42] in a chair set her on your lap and tell
[47:44] her you're ready to enter into real
[47:46] Fellowship excuse me for this rude
[47:48] expression but that's not complete yet
[47:50] Fellowship complete only can come
[47:51] through relationship and the only way
[47:53] you can completely fellowship with your
[47:55] wife as your wife she's never become a
[47:57] complete Fellowship to you until she has
[48:00] abide in relationship that's the bedroom
[48:03] that's where New Life Begins now we
[48:05] understand that that that is true in the
[48:07] justification sanctification the baptism
[48:09] of the Holy Ghost right where we come
[48:11] into relationship with God but he wants
[48:14] husband and wife to have a good time
[48:15] with each other he wants you to enjoy
[48:17] each other uh there's nothing wrong with
[48:19] that you know the scripture always says
[48:21] that that uh about the U marriage is
[48:25] Honorable and the bad undefined
[48:27] have fun with your spouse have fun with
[48:29] you that's what you put here for do it
[48:31] in a Godly manner though let's go to the
[48:33] next one Genesis
[48:35] 1 he gave us the ability to
[48:39] multiply but not by sex the first part
[48:41] this part and God blessed him and God
[48:43] said un them be fruitful and multiply
[48:45] and replenish the Earth and subdue it he
[48:48] give that
[48:49] to
[48:51] them that's what he expects right them
[48:55] and have dominion over the Fisher Sea
[48:56] and the of the air and over every living
[48:58] thing that moveth upon the Earth so he
[49:00] gave it to them he blessed them and said
[49:03] unto them not just Adam he he said to
[49:07] them be fruitful and multiply and
[49:10] replenish the Earth and subdue it all
[49:12] right Hebrews 13:4 marriage is Honorable
[49:15] in all and the bed undefiled but wh
[49:16] mongers and adulterers God will judge so
[49:20] we need to make sure we stay in our
[49:22] clean living correct Ecclesiastes listen
[49:25] live joyfully with the wife whom thou
[49:27] lovest all the days of thy life of thy
[49:29] vanity which he ha given thee under the
[49:31] son all the days of thy vanity for that
[49:34] is thy portion in this life and thy
[49:36] labor which thou takest Under the Sun
[49:39] what to live joyfully with the wife whom
[49:41] thou lovest all the days of your life I
[49:44] love to see a a couple just really love
[49:47] each other nevertheless let every one of
[49:50] you in particular so love his wife even
[49:52] as himself and the wife see that she
[49:55] reverence her husband ship
[49:58] now we went over these and we'll just
[50:00] kind of cover them real quick for those
[50:02] of you that forgot but this is
[50:04] fellowship and relationship based on
[50:06] love not just lust and all the other
[50:08] things of the world cuz you got your
[50:10] double Covenant actually the double
[50:12] Covenant you say well that makes the
[50:14] woman down here and the man up here well
[50:16] if you look at it right it restores the
[50:19] order to where that we got to live in
[50:21] down
[50:23] here right we have to live in that order
[50:25] Christ is our head always right Christ
[50:28] is always going to be our head it didn't
[50:30] matter if we didn't have a fall right
[50:33] but the double Covenant restores the
[50:34] order of headship and fellowship it's
[50:37] giving us a way back to the coequal of
[50:40] joint airs yeah cuz what does it say in
[50:42] 1 Peter 3 we read it that they may be
[50:46] join airs with the grace of life or
[50:49] co-equal all right if men would act like
[50:51] men and women act like women will be
[50:53] able to have fellowship and relationship
[50:54] with each other and with the Lord Jesus
[50:56] Jesus bringing together for Fellowship
[50:59] based on love then we showed what the
[51:01] four loves were a goly love which is the
[51:03] love of God Divine love perfect love or
[51:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right
[51:08] A lot of people wants to know what
[51:09] perfect love is brother B said everybody
[51:11] that went across a curtain of time and
[51:13] that sixth Dimension had what perfect
[51:15] love right so guess what if they were in
[51:18] the sixth Dimension and they were over
[51:20] there all together they had to have the
[51:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost to be in that
[51:24] Dimension so perfect love is the baptism
[51:26] of the Holy Ghost amen people fought
[51:28] over that and questioned it and
[51:30] everything else what did what does
[51:32] perfect love mean well it means you got
[51:33] the Holy Ghost
[51:35] amen simple am now filal love is a love
[51:39] for your spouse OS is sexual love
[51:41] sensual lust or lust sensual love or
[51:44] lust and storage is a love between
[51:46] family parents and children now remember
[51:48] what we said the true the true will of
[51:51] God was for us to have a gothy love amen
[51:54] right right cuz Adam had the Holy Ghost
[51:57] Eve had the Holy Ghost right right they
[52:01] had eternal life in their soul amen
[52:04] right they have eternal life in their
[52:06] soul that's ay love that wasn't filal
[52:08] love right but when what happened in the
[52:10] garden what Satan done he took that
[52:12] highest form of love and he started
[52:14] doing what he always does is dilute it
[52:17] break it down and make it into something
[52:20] that he wanted it to be and God said
[52:22] okay I'll allow fil your love because
[52:24] that's a love for the spouse show a
[52:27] love right heos which is sexual love and
[52:30] he brings all that in we got to have
[52:32] that so we can procreate down here and
[52:35] then we do have love for our family
[52:37] which is app parent to a child you
[52:39] wouldn't have any of these other loves
[52:41] for a child but you see how though in
[52:43] the end time you look how Satan's took
[52:45] every bit of that and just rolled it all
[52:47] together you see all these men with
[52:48] these children having these loot acts
[52:50] and all stuff my Lord Brother brand
[52:53] thought it was almost insane I think
[52:54] we're past insane in
[52:57] 2012 all this junk going on in schools
[53:00] and all
[53:01] that we ought to know it's the end time
[53:04] right amen cuz Sodom and Gomorrah Sodom
[53:07] and Gomorrah I don't know if it was this
[53:09] bad I don't think it was this bad in a
[53:11] worldly SC in a world wide scale Sodom
[53:14] and gomorra was that way in two cities
[53:15] of the world and God destroyed those two
[53:18] cities but who was it I don't know it
[53:20] was brother Brandon but somebody said if
[53:21] he didn't destroy this country or this
[53:23] world he'd have to raise up Sodom and
[53:25] gomorra and apologize for doing that
[53:29] because that was just two cities this is
[53:30] the our whole world is perverted but
[53:33] what is go what is he doing though
[53:35] Satan's took out agapy love the love of
[53:37] God and he's perverted it down right but
[53:40] now what we're doing is we're taking and
[53:42] we're rolling it back up to that agap
[53:44] love right right which is the love of
[53:46] God because that's what
[53:48] uh I don't think I put it in here yeah I
[53:51] did 1 Corinthians 13 let's go to the
[53:52] next one and we'll read what the Bible
[53:55] said about it notice the Great
[53:56] Masterpiece of the family husband and
[53:58] wife cannot be truly a family unless
[54:00] they are one they have to be if they're
[54:03] not they're not a good family wife
[54:05] pulling one way and husband another that
[54:07] would make an awful family but in
[54:09] agreement with love one to the other
[54:11] that's a family and now that was God's
[54:13] Masterpiece and now all the true family
[54:15] here portrays that see and now the
[54:18] Masterpiece family has come again Christ
[54:20] and his bride ready to come the second
[54:22] Adam second Eve ready now to return back
[54:24] to their home and the whole picture has
[54:26] been
[54:26] what Redemption amen from where it was
[54:29] bringing it back see just exactly
[54:32] bringing it back again cuz what is
[54:35] redemption it's restoring back what fell
[54:38] right the fellowship that fell with god
[54:41] with man and woman being coequal that's
[54:43] what we're going back to or we didn't
[54:45] fall from that to start with but we did
[54:47] fall from that and that's what we got to
[54:48] get back to uh this gospel is really a
[54:51] simple go simple gospel if you'll listen
[54:54] number 18
[54:56] love should govern the home love is the
[54:59] greatest force that was ever put in the
[55:01] power of a man of man a home that's not
[55:03] disciplined by love is not much of a
[55:05] home if the husband and wife doesn't
[55:07] solemnly love each other they can they
[55:09] cannot trust each other and going down
[55:12] to the bottom now love is in two
[55:13] different words two different meanings
[55:15] in the Greek one of them is called filio
[55:18] that's the love that you have for your
[55:19] wife Agy love is the love divine love
[55:22] now the love that you have for your wife
[55:24] and the love of God Is So contrary see
[55:26] what Satan's done he's made it so
[55:27] contrary just listen to this the love
[55:30] that you have for your wife if a man
[55:31] would insult her you'd kill him on the
[55:33] spot with that kind of love fil your
[55:36] love but with a go of Love you'd pray
[55:38] for his lost soul that'd be the
[55:40] difference there's two different types
[55:41] of love and I'm almost sure that many of
[55:43] us has been deceived with having filal
[55:46] love and thinking it's a
[55:49] love see that's what's happening to the
[55:53] the uh people in the end time that the
[55:55] anointed one
[55:56] KN ones at the end time they feel that
[55:59] agape love they feel it on them right
[56:03] but it's nothing more than filal love
[56:04] it's just love of just coming and being
[56:06] around people and but Agy love is the
[56:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost that puts you
[56:10] into the body all right so that's what
[56:12] we got to have folks let's go have F
[56:14] Your Love F your love is
[56:17] intellectual right Agy love comes from
[56:20] the heart that's human love affectionate
[56:23] love and godly love Godly love doesn't
[56:25] question
[56:26] human love reasons but Godly love
[56:28] doesn't it's perfect in its trust it's
[56:31] perfect it just produces faith when you
[56:34] really love amen all right let's go to
[56:36] the next
[56:38] one kinsman
[56:42] redeemer I like this one him and his
[56:44] wife were talking laying in the bed
[56:47] talking children didn't have to go to
[56:48] school they got talking about different
[56:50] things how many of you do that I didn't
[56:53] think
[56:55] so no nobody raise your
[56:58] hand remember I remember one time
[57:00] brother Brown was talking remember he
[57:01] said he was preaching to Mee and said
[57:02] she he looked over and she was asleep
[57:05] yeah well I guess I wasn't he said
[57:07] something I guess I wasn't impressing
[57:08] her or something like that you know but
[57:10] a prophet youd think a prophet preaching
[57:12] but they were human you know so same way
[57:14] with you and I I said hatred had a
[57:16] beginning so it has to have an end love
[57:19] had no beginning so it has no end hatred
[57:22] is forever love is eternal hatred begins
[57:25] and hatred will end love never did begin
[57:27] and it never will end see it's Eternal
[57:30] and When a Man Loves a Woman and marries
[57:32] her because she's just pretty there'll
[57:34] be an end to that but when a man finds a
[57:36] woman that he loves he don't know why
[57:39] but he loves her and she finds a man
[57:41] that she loves no matter what he looks
[57:42] like he loves her she loves him that's
[57:45] an eternal mate in glory
[57:48] am they all death nor nothing else can
[57:51] ever separate them because they are from
[57:54] eternity they step down into space of
[57:56] time and return back to Eternity
[57:59] eternity has dropped in a body called
[58:01] time then it goes right back into
[58:02] eternity again it cannot perish now
[58:07] listen if you read that you look more
[58:09] like it you were back in eternity
[58:12] married to your mate well in God's mind
[58:15] you were yeah if she's born again and
[58:17] you're born again you're both going to
[58:19] heaven you both were in the mind of God
[58:20] right you both were you both were God
[58:23] saw you but you Ste down into space of
[58:25] time time and will return back to
[58:27] Eternity yeah because Adam and Eve were
[58:30] same here they're going to be the same
[58:31] when they get the glory it's not going
[58:33] to be Adam and 14 other people it's
[58:35] going to be Adam and Eve right same
[58:37] thing with you and I you know brother
[58:38] Bram told about him and Med and hope
[58:42] there's not any problem with that there
[58:44] right but God has listen this is my
[58:46] thoughts on
[58:48] this we could have
[58:52] stayed and been Eternal and and
[58:57] what would we have
[58:59] done but we come down
[59:01] here and God by Miracles put us together
[59:06] y lot of us by Miracles he put us
[59:08] together right and we had children and
[59:12] those children grew up and became
[59:13] preachers and put souls in glory right
[59:16] right how much more better would that be
[59:18] than it would be just to say well we
[59:19] were in eternity and we stayed in
[59:21] eternity and we were Eternal people
[59:24] no he said death nor nothing else can
[59:27] separate them they're an eternal maid in
[59:30] glory because they are from eternity
[59:32] what the eternal life they had was from
[59:33] eternity right right and they steep down
[59:37] into space of time and will return back
[59:39] to Eternity am cuz you're going back to
[59:41] that Eternal that always was right so
[59:44] don't get in your mind that you were
[59:45] married Soul mated back over here
[59:47] somewhere but actually in the mind of
[59:49] God if you're born again and she's born
[59:52] again you were with that Soul right back
[59:55] in eternity and God knew that you'd come
[59:57] down here and be be U uh you know you
[1:00:00] take Mom I mean dad's mom and and Dad's
[1:00:04] mother and father here he was 60
[1:00:06] something years old here she was 42
[1:00:08] going through the chains and then Here
[1:00:10] Comes him right well out of him comes
[1:00:13] here right without that it wouldn't have
[1:00:16] been any of this right you say how do
[1:00:18] you know well how do you not know right
[1:00:22] eternity has dropped down in the body
[1:00:23] called time then it goes right back up
[1:00:25] into eternity again it cannot perish
[1:00:28] right all right let's go to keep
[1:00:31] trolling 1 Corinthians 13:4 charity
[1:00:35] which is what love love suffereth long
[1:00:37] and is
[1:00:38] kind I want youall to listen to
[1:00:42] this because this is all about love this
[1:00:45] is the love of God and supposed to be in
[1:00:47] our heart toward each
[1:00:49] other charity suffereth long and is kind
[1:00:52] charity envieth not charity bth not
[1:00:55] itself other words it doesn't raise
[1:00:57] itself up to here yeah it's not puffed
[1:01:00] up does not behave itself unseemingly
[1:01:03] seeketh not her own and is not easily
[1:01:05] provoked thinketh no evil rejoices not
[1:01:09] in iniquity but rejoices in the truth
[1:01:11] beareth all things believeth all things
[1:01:14] hopeth all things endureth all things
[1:01:16] this is charity and you take that
[1:01:18] charity and you bring it down though to
[1:01:20] F your love between you and your
[1:01:23] spouse that's where we should be living
[1:01:27] yeah
[1:01:28] right that's where we should be
[1:01:31] living you say well that's between me
[1:01:33] and God you're not married to God as far
[1:01:36] as that's concerned you're married down
[1:01:38] here to your wife let's talk about that
[1:01:40] okay cuz if we don't get this thing the
[1:01:42] primer thing's right we're not going to
[1:01:43] get the the love of God I don't think
[1:01:45] like brother R said a person can't be an
[1:01:49] unbeliever and a Believer be together
[1:01:51] and have Harmony like it's talking about
[1:01:53] here you just can't do that I'm sorry I
[1:01:56] didn't make the rules but God said you
[1:01:57] just can't be unequally yolked and have
[1:02:00] this but if you have charity let's go a
[1:02:02] little bit further you that are that are
[1:02:04] sitting here without your spouse if you
[1:02:06] have that
[1:02:08] charity yeah you have that
[1:02:11] charity that's like the little woman
[1:02:13] that cleaned up after her husband
[1:02:16] supposedly drunk kicked everything down
[1:02:18] in the floor and said clean it up and
[1:02:20] she's cleaning up must Jesus bear the
[1:02:22] cross alone what' she do her love
[1:02:24] suffereth long that wasn't the feeling
[1:02:26] of Love cuz she could have probably
[1:02:28] inside of herself she wanted to kill
[1:02:30] him let's just be human about it
[1:02:33] truthful yeah she probably thought some
[1:02:35] things in her mind but what took over
[1:02:38] the love of God took over and said must
[1:02:40] Jesus bear the cross alone and all the
[1:02:42] world go free that was her charity that
[1:02:45] she showed but that charity that she
[1:02:46] showed went over and got that man yeah
[1:02:50] and his buddy M and brought him to the
[1:02:53] Lord amen amen amen come on sisters he
[1:02:57] didn't get they didn't get it from a
[1:02:58] pull pit preaching they got it from a
[1:03:00] life live
[1:03:03] right but it was the word of God living
[1:03:05] right through that sister right showing
[1:03:08] charity charity suffereth long and His
[1:03:10] Kind charity envieth not bth not bless
[1:03:15] God I'm a Christian and you're not no
[1:03:18] no just but you got to be
[1:03:21] different you got to be different you
[1:03:23] got to let them see that it's different
[1:03:26] that you're different all right let's go
[1:03:28] to the next one 1 John 4:18 God is
[1:03:31] restoring True Fellowship there's no
[1:03:34] fear in love what do we talk about Adam
[1:03:36] first thing Adam said I was afraid yeah
[1:03:39] now 1 John 4:18 is telling us right here
[1:03:41] there's no fear and love right but
[1:03:44] perfect love the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:47] Ghost castest out fear because fear hath
[1:03:51] torment right we were talking downstairs
[1:03:55] that's what's the problem with
[1:03:58] remembering our previous life yeah
[1:04:01] that's the torment part what kids that's
[1:04:03] what we're trying to keep you away from
[1:04:06] from making the mistakes that we made
[1:04:08] right where you don't have to sit down
[1:04:11] and and every time you drive down the
[1:04:12] street and you live this neighborhood
[1:04:14] all your life and and you know just for
[1:04:16] an example say you've had a relationship
[1:04:18] with this woman and that woman and that
[1:04:20] guy well every time you drive by if you
[1:04:21] still live there guess what the devil's
[1:04:23] going to say you remember when yeah go
[1:04:27] somewhere at Walmart and meet an old
[1:04:28] girlfriend from a long time ago remember
[1:04:31] when remember what you did yeah but
[1:04:35] there's no fear in that kind of love
[1:04:37] right right you have perfect love that
[1:04:40] cast out all that fear right you put it
[1:04:43] right back on the devil and say
[1:04:46] look that was not me that did
[1:04:49] that the one you're talking to now is
[1:04:52] not the one you were talking to back
[1:04:53] then right and you know what resist the
[1:04:56] devil and he'll flee from you amen he
[1:04:59] that fearth is not made
[1:05:01] perfect in love right he that fearth if
[1:05:05] you have
[1:05:07] fear you're not made perfect in love all
[1:05:11] right now let's go to number
[1:05:17] 20 about the only religion and salvation
[1:05:19] we have and love is amongst the real
[1:05:21] godly people you know the Bible said
[1:05:24] that would happen congregation said amen
[1:05:26] uh-huh you Bible readers I heard you
[1:05:28] holler amen and you preachers back there
[1:05:30] that that's right the love would be so
[1:05:32] far away in the last days the only love
[1:05:35] that would be left would be between the
[1:05:36] elect of God's
[1:05:37] people the father would be against
[1:05:39] mother the mother against father
[1:05:41] children against parents and different
[1:05:42] ones against each other and the only
[1:05:44] love that will be left will be just be
[1:05:46] that elect just the elected the word
[1:05:49] elect here comes from the word elected
[1:05:51] God's elected people all right you Bible
[1:05:54] readers the love would be so far away in
[1:05:57] the last days the only love would be
[1:05:58] left would be between the elect of God's
[1:06:00] people why cuz we have the Pinnacle of
[1:06:04] love we have a gothly love if you're
[1:06:06] born again so we're the only ones that
[1:06:07] know how to love everybody else is down
[1:06:10] here and those other three filo ER off
[1:06:12] stores they're just sitting down here
[1:06:14] just slopping around like brother Brown
[1:06:15] said dog eat dog this world don't care
[1:06:17] about marriage and divorce that's what I
[1:06:19] was telling you this morning they don't
[1:06:22] care tell me they care they don't care
[1:06:25] about me Mar and divorce and what what
[1:06:26] the Bible said about it is brother said
[1:06:29] misinterpret the theology is what god
[1:06:31] well what is that some preacher telling
[1:06:34] them it's okay yeah some preacher saying
[1:06:37] this and some preacher saying
[1:06:38] that but that's why I said only the
[1:06:41] elect only the Born Again people needed
[1:06:43] the grace right we're the only ones that
[1:06:46] needed the grace of marriage and divorce
[1:06:48] they don't need it they're just ding
[1:06:50] dogs slopping around they if they get
[1:06:53] born again then they'll need it right
[1:06:56] but they don't get born again they're
[1:06:57] lost anyway right so I said don't cast
[1:07:00] your pearls before slne
[1:07:02] people don't and I'm not saying don't
[1:07:04] waste your time no witness to them right
[1:07:07] amen tell them how Jesus saved your soul
[1:07:09] right amen and then do one more
[1:07:11] important
[1:07:12] thing show them that you change right no
[1:07:16] just lip service show it to them you
[1:07:18] show it to them and I'll guarantee you
[1:07:20] they'll come or they're not
[1:07:21] predestinated to it anyway amen all
[1:07:23] right one of the two all right right
[1:07:28] now let's go to the next
[1:07:33] one remember we talked about motive and
[1:07:35] objective and the threedimensional love
[1:07:37] which is Body Spirit and soul and then
[1:07:39] true love requires all three of those
[1:07:41] part right yep because now if you're not
[1:07:44] born again you're only you're only truly
[1:07:46] married in your body and spirit you're
[1:07:48] not you're not soul to soul brother
[1:07:50] Brown remember he it's body to body
[1:07:51] Spirit to Spirit soul to soul you're not
[1:07:53] soul to soul no if you're not born again
[1:07:56] all right now let's go to the note just
[1:08:00] keep scrolling on through in marriage
[1:08:02] there must be the same kind of love and
[1:08:03] unity in Body Spirit and soul that's why
[1:08:06] God took woman out of man so they could
[1:08:08] truly be one in marriage see you can't
[1:08:11] leave The woman Inside the Man the
[1:08:13] woman's got to come out for Fellowship
[1:08:14] amen all
[1:08:16] right and like brother um Colin said
[1:08:19] downstairs where did he take her out of
[1:08:20] right there at his heart right there at
[1:08:22] the rib right there at the heart of of
[1:08:24] of man and then indeed they were one
[1:08:26] being in the beginning man is commanded
[1:08:29] to love his wife as his own body and
[1:08:32] indeed they were one being in the
[1:08:33] beginning the only way that a husband
[1:08:35] can truly love his wife as his own body
[1:08:38] as if they have that three-dimensional
[1:08:39] love cuz you can't have it without
[1:08:41] threedimensional love you can't have you
[1:08:44] know you can say well we're body to
[1:08:46] body that's just lust that's just Eros
[1:08:49] that's just you know that's just having
[1:08:51] relationship we're talking about
[1:08:53] relationship and fellowship right once
[1:08:55] again again what is important here is
[1:08:56] that unless a man and woman are truly
[1:08:58] one in Christ they can never have the
[1:09:01] kind of true love and fellowship that
[1:09:02] God intends now that would be
[1:09:04] self-explanatory if one's God and one's
[1:09:06] a devil they ain't no Fellowship there
[1:09:08] right and listen if we're if we're not
[1:09:11] born again we're of the devil sorry
[1:09:13] right right if we're not born again
[1:09:15] we're of the devil they may have a unity
[1:09:18] in body and spirit in other words like
[1:09:20] things or get along with each other hey
[1:09:22] I've known people especially around our
[1:09:24] our community that been married 60 years
[1:09:27] probably never went to church a day in
[1:09:28] their life but they just got to know
[1:09:29] each other in body and spirit but now if
[1:09:32] they're not born again they're just
[1:09:34] going to go away right right they just
[1:09:37] lived here for no other purpose but just
[1:09:39] to be here they may have a unity in body
[1:09:42] and spirit but without a born again
[1:09:44] experience you can never have the unity
[1:09:47] in your soul right amen all
[1:09:50] right now let's go to Ephesians 5 so
[1:09:53] ought men to love their wives that their
[1:09:55] own B he that loveth his wife loveth
[1:09:59] himself for no man ever yet hated his
[1:10:02] own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth
[1:10:05] it even as the Lord the church for we
[1:10:09] are members of his body of his flesh and
[1:10:11] of his bones for this cause shall a man
[1:10:14] leave his father and mother here we go
[1:10:16] again this is just like it was back in
[1:10:18] the beginning and shall be joined into
[1:10:20] his wife and they two shall be one flesh
[1:10:23] right all right let's go to the
[1:10:28] next worldly marriages are established
[1:10:30] only as one or two dimensional
[1:10:32] relationship in a one-dimensional union
[1:10:34] their love may only be a physical
[1:10:36] attraction lust or romance a
[1:10:38] two-dimensional Union includes their
[1:10:40] Spirit the second realm they now have a
[1:10:42] friendship common interest and all that
[1:10:44] but only in a Christian marriage does
[1:10:46] all three dimensions come into view
[1:10:47] giving them a fulfilling relationship
[1:10:50] that's why you should never marry an
[1:10:52] unbeliever or never date an unbeliever
[1:10:54] thinking you're to get him to come to
[1:10:56] church or get him or her to do something
[1:10:59] just try to cut through that try to get
[1:11:01] out of all that and cut straight to uh
[1:11:04] like I said this morning you're going to
[1:11:05] have enough problems as it is much less
[1:11:07] being born again I mean not born again
[1:11:10] and trying to live a a life you know you
[1:11:13] just you just can't do it it'd be hard
[1:11:16] it's hard enough living two Christians
[1:11:17] living together all right let's go to

[1:16:26] 24 oh for the grace of God that he would

[1:16:30] Mysteries as Paul spoke here further
[1:16:32] down in Ephesians speaking of the
[1:16:34] husband and wife this is the mystery how
[1:16:36] the women should be in respect to their
[1:16:38] husband even the second place I believe
[1:16:40] it is the entire Bible that reverence
[1:16:42] was ever spoke to said the woman seeing
[1:16:44] she reverence her husband reverence her
[1:16:46] husband then a husband ought to live
[1:16:48] such a life before his wife here's where
[1:16:51] Abraham and Sarah comes in act like a
[1:16:54] lord and she'll call you Lord guys
[1:16:57] gentlemen
[1:16:59] brothers act the life then a husband
[1:17:02] excuse me ought to live such a life
[1:17:04] before his wife that his wife could
[1:17:06] reverence him as a Son of God and if he
[1:17:09] doesn't live that kind of life well then
[1:17:11] of course she wouldn't reverence him cuz
[1:17:13] she knows what he's made of but when it
[1:17:16] is a man that is a reverent man reverent
[1:17:18] and clean with his wife and before his
[1:17:21] family a real servant of God then the
[1:17:23] women children and all should respect
[1:17:25] that servant of God Amen with reverence
[1:17:28] is that right amen right
[1:17:35] amen I don't know if we going to have
[1:17:37] time to do all this or
[1:17:39] not can we do anything tonight yeah can
[1:17:42] we you ain't got anything
[1:17:44] pressing all right well let's skip cuz
[1:17:46] we'll go back to the role of the man cuz
[1:17:49] I want to get to the last one you're
[1:17:50] going to have to skip through there
[1:17:52] brother
[1:17:56] go
[1:17:57] to keep scrolling to the role of the
[1:18:00] family that's after quote number
[1:18:03] 40 three and you notice we were only on
[1:18:06] quote
[1:18:11] 25 we can understand all that keep going
[1:18:15] down to where the roll of the family
[1:18:17] we'll get into
[1:18:20] that that's what I like about this you
[1:18:22] can go forward and backwards
[1:18:25] go to 43 go back
[1:18:29] back keep going
[1:18:34] back go to gen where it says Genesis
[1:18:37] 1:26
[1:18:40] 27 working it there it is right there
[1:18:44] let's get into this one and then we'll
[1:18:45] do the we'll do the uh role of the
[1:18:48] husband and the wife Wednesday if that's
[1:18:50] all right with
[1:18:52] y'all amen all right am
[1:18:55] because I want to get we got more family
[1:18:57] here on on the weekends than we do
[1:18:59] shameful to say sorry but I L A lot of
[1:19:02] you live away and that but that's okay
[1:19:04] but we really want I want to get this
[1:19:06] with all the kids here and all the
[1:19:07] parents here so you don't have to maybe
[1:19:11] you don't have to find it and listen to
[1:19:12] it Genesis 1 now we're going to shift
[1:19:15] from Marriage we're going to do the roll
[1:19:16] of the male and the roll of the female
[1:19:18] Wednesday now we're going to get to the
[1:19:19] family cuz I didn't cover all this the
[1:19:21] last time and God said let us make man
[1:19:24] in our own own image and after our
[1:19:25] likeness and let them have dominion over
[1:19:27] the fish of the sea and over the foul of
[1:19:28] the air and over the cattle and over all
[1:19:30] the Earth and over every creeping thing
[1:19:32] that creepeth upon the Earth so God
[1:19:34] created man in His image and the image
[1:19:36] of God created to him male and
[1:19:39] female created he them so the role of
[1:19:41] the family is to have a male and a
[1:19:43] female right not a male and a male or a
[1:19:46] female and a female like this world got
[1:19:48] it messed up but male and female created
[1:19:51] he them for what
[1:19:55] Genesis
[1:19:57] 9:1 this is before the
[1:20:00] fall now let's scroll down to just keep
[1:20:02] scrolling we're okay and God blessed
[1:20:05] Noah now this is after the fall and
[1:20:07] after the flood and God blessed Noah and
[1:20:09] his sons and said unto them be fruitful
[1:20:11] and multiply and replenish the Earth all
[1:20:13] right first thing coming out he telling
[1:20:15] look multiply and replenish the Earth
[1:20:17] Genesis 2:23 and Adam said this is now
[1:20:20] bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh
[1:20:22] she shall be called woman because she
[1:20:23] was taken out of man therefore shall a
[1:20:25] man leave his father and mother here we
[1:20:28] go again and shall cleave unto his wife
[1:20:31] and they shall be one flesh all right
[1:20:35] then Genesis 3:16 here's where we were
[1:20:38] talking about where the double Covenant
[1:20:40] came in but what's what he tells the
[1:20:41] woman to do unto the woman he said I
[1:20:43] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[1:20:45] conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring
[1:20:47] forth
[1:20:49] children sisters were put on the earth
[1:20:51] to do what bring forth children all
[1:20:54] right and thy desire shall be to thy
[1:20:56] husband and he shall rule over thee now
[1:20:58] we'll get into that later on with the
[1:21:00] role of the male and the female but in
[1:21:02] the family that's what's wrong with the
[1:21:05] family now is the family unit now
[1:21:08] brother Brown there many quotes he said
[1:21:09] about that about the family unit Satan
[1:21:12] knew that if he could get to that family
[1:21:14] unit what did he do over there before
[1:21:17] the flood he took
[1:21:20] the
[1:21:21] daughters of man sons of God put them
[1:21:24] together what did he do he brother say
[1:21:26] he diluted the family yeah he got in
[1:21:29] there and took unbelievers and married
[1:21:31] them to Believers and then got he that's
[1:21:33] the same thing he was doing but God told
[1:21:35] him said You shall bring forth children
[1:21:37] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[1:21:39] and he shall rule over the right now in
[1:21:42] interpreting that God is
[1:21:44] telling
[1:21:46] us that the man has a position the woman
[1:21:50] has a position your desire sisters is to
[1:21:53] your husband not three other husbands or
[1:21:55] other boyfriend to your husband husband
[1:21:57] you are same to the wife and he shall
[1:22:00] rule over thee with Godly love not with
[1:22:02] a rule of iron or a rule of of hardness
[1:22:06] but you'll rule over her and she won't
[1:22:08] have to give an account for you but you
[1:22:10] got to give an account of what she's
[1:22:11] doing all right do you guys remember
[1:22:15] that I I don't think that sinks in too
[1:22:21] far your wife walks out in the street
[1:22:25] with her clothes all cleaning to her and
[1:22:27] her and her breast showing and her rear
[1:22:29] end and everything and got on spikes
[1:22:31] about that high what does you do when
[1:22:33] you got spikes on about that high
[1:22:36] brothers and sisters this goes this way
[1:22:38] and that goes that way right yeah m is
[1:22:42] that
[1:22:43] comfortable no it's to show yourself
[1:22:46] period right the
[1:22:49] devil it's a
[1:22:51] devil it's not you it's a devil it's not
[1:22:54] comfortable read what brother Brown says
[1:22:56] about these things but if she makes a
[1:22:58] guy lust after her sure she's going to
[1:23:01] have to give an account but you got to
[1:23:03] give an account for what she did what
[1:23:06] she put
[1:23:07] on this is serious business people this
[1:23:10] is not just something where old brother
[1:23:12] Wade's going to try to tell us how to
[1:23:13] run our life I'm not telling you how to
[1:23:15] run your life I'm doing my best to tell
[1:23:17] you the prophet showed you how to run
[1:23:18] your life and the Bible showed you how
[1:23:20] to run your life you just don't listen
[1:23:22] to it no more you listen to me and
[1:23:23] brother d amen sorry but it's the
[1:23:28] truth get on that other side of that
[1:23:30] wedge and the only way to get back is to
[1:23:32] come back to the
[1:23:33] truth amen if not you're just going to
[1:23:36] keep getting worse and worse and worse
[1:23:39] right I I didn't make these things that
[1:23:41] the prophet told us amen but here let's
[1:23:43] listen
[1:23:46] 43a impersonation of Christianity what
[1:23:49] brought you in the first place thust
[1:23:51] Thou Art sin crept in and we had to go
[1:23:53] well we're still God will never be
[1:23:55] defeated he expected this Earth to be
[1:23:57] inhabited so he just made woman to bring
[1:23:59] children he still pours the calcium and
[1:24:02] potash and the elements into them and
[1:24:04] builds them up then he brings them to a
[1:24:06] place and let you make a
[1:24:08] choice and if without a choice God made
[1:24:11] me one day a young man strong and
[1:24:13] healthy and happy and the Holy Ghost not
[1:24:16] some cold formal theological theological
[1:24:19] Theological Seminary Dogma but the
[1:24:20] Blessed Holy Spirit not the tree of
[1:24:22] knowledge but the Holy Spirit you see
[1:24:24] it's God's program began to woo over me
[1:24:27] and make love to me and I accepted him
[1:24:29] and then he came down into my heart and
[1:24:30] took his place what he saying is that's
[1:24:33] what's happening back up here God will
[1:24:35] never be defeated he put woman to bring
[1:24:37] children but he's still the one put the
[1:24:39] thing
[1:24:40] together what happens millions of germs
[1:24:44] millions of eggs how does one crawl over
[1:24:46] and get the one in the very
[1:24:48] back it's God right God's purpose is not
[1:24:52] going to be defeated right
[1:24:55] right you're going to get here if you're
[1:24:56] supposed to be here all right now let's
[1:25:00] go to number
[1:25:02] 43b he said but listen my dear you
[1:25:04] lovely little thing now this is Satan
[1:25:06] talking to Eve surely God Made You for a
[1:25:09] purpose you know that's right see you're
[1:25:10] a woman you were made for this purpose
[1:25:13] what was Satan doing through the Beast
[1:25:14] he was showing what he was showing the
[1:25:16] animals and what they were doing right
[1:25:19] they were procreating and and having
[1:25:21] babies so he said hey this is what
[1:25:23] you're made for Satan s through the
[1:25:25] beast that's what you're made for that's
[1:25:27] what it is you don't know it now but you
[1:25:29] were made for this purpose oh you're a
[1:25:31] lovely little deer old thing dear look
[1:25:34] at those dainy little hands well sure
[1:25:35] you will sure he said but oh you think
[1:25:38] that a good loving father God would do a
[1:25:41] thing like that yeah now you see the
[1:25:43] seed that she was holding and would have
[1:25:45] finally become a mother by the will of
[1:25:47] God through a spoken word y so that's
[1:25:51] how we were supposed to come yeah that's
[1:25:53] how the family was supposed to be made
[1:25:55] by the will of God through a spoken word
[1:25:59] she would have finally become a mother
[1:26:01] but she couldn't wait went into that so
[1:26:03] the natural act
[1:26:05] happened what natural act happened
[1:26:07] stopped you and I from being born the
[1:26:09] way we should have been born right so we
[1:26:11] had to come another way through the
[1:26:14] double Covenant coming down and through
[1:26:15] women being made to where to have
[1:26:17] children there's no secret that that's
[1:26:19] what you're supposed to do all right
[1:26:21] let's
[1:26:22] go next one
[1:26:26] now notice what happened to Eve's
[1:26:27] children the first one that was born now
[1:26:29] if God said multiply to his bride to
[1:26:31] Adam's bride and replenish multiply and
[1:26:33] replenish the Earth that was God's
[1:26:35] commission and she would have done it
[1:26:37] and he would mix themselves together but
[1:26:39] what happened when Adam got ready to
[1:26:42] come to her she was already a mother see
[1:26:43] what I mean when God give a commission
[1:26:46] which cannot perish God's word is
[1:26:48] eternal it cannot fail when he said
[1:26:50] multiply and replenish the Earth that
[1:26:52] was God's eternal purpose yeah to carry
[1:26:56] that out you cannot die because it's his
[1:26:58] word you have to live if that child been
[1:27:00] brought forth right there' have been no
[1:27:02] death but remember she couldn't wait
[1:27:05] right all right let's go to the next one
[1:27:08] note God purpos for husband and wife to
[1:27:10] bring forth children he was establishing
[1:27:12] the family the family is God's intended
[1:27:14] results of the marriage relationship
[1:27:16] that he established in Eden cuz he was
[1:27:20] what Jehovah God right father with a
[1:27:23] family am he wanted to be a daddy amen
[1:27:26] before Adam and Eve become before Adam
[1:27:29] become a daddy he become a daddy right
[1:27:32] because Adam was a Son of God right
[1:27:35] right all right so let's go through next
[1:27:38] one the way to have Fellowship his heart
[1:27:41] is greater for Fellowship than ours and
[1:27:43] the reason he makes us that way is
[1:27:45] because we're offsprings of
[1:27:48] his that's what makes us long for
[1:27:50] Fellowship
[1:27:54] that's what makes a woman would die for
[1:27:56] her baby why that's what makes a father
[1:27:58] would give his life for his wife a
[1:28:00] husband a true husband would give his
[1:28:02] life for his wife why because Christ
[1:28:05] gave his life for the church his wife
[1:28:07] it's a strain in you listen to this want
[1:28:09] you to listen to this and it makes a
[1:28:11] mother Dash to a burning fire not
[1:28:13] thinking about her own self and her hair
[1:28:15] on fire and her clothes on fire to grab
[1:28:17] her baby and run out with it why it's
[1:28:19] love of a parent and God is the first
[1:28:22] and Original Parent amen and there's
[1:28:25] where that strain comes
[1:28:30] through that's why it's in US yeah cuz
[1:28:33] God is that way he went through hell to
[1:28:35] get me and
[1:28:36] you right he went through hell to get me
[1:28:40] and you physically I mean literally he
[1:28:42] went down the hell you know we went with
[1:28:44] him so we don't have to go anymore but
[1:28:46] he stopped all this business to bring us
[1:28:49] up but that's where the strain comes
[1:28:52] from CU God's the first original Parent
[1:28:54] all right so we can learn something from
[1:28:57] what the way God treats us is the way we
[1:28:59] should treat the children correct all
[1:29:01] right now let's go to the next one
[1:29:04] excuse me Mother's Mother's
[1:29:06] Day here's the one I wanted you to to
[1:29:09] see then we shall see him then we shall
[1:29:12] be like him then we shall worship him
[1:29:15] then we shall see mother as God wants
[1:29:17] her mother would not be complete there
[1:29:19] without her family cuz the greatest time
[1:29:21] of all her life is to see the children
[1:29:24] children around the table and all of
[1:29:25] them healthy and happy and to see her
[1:29:27] pour the coffee or whatever she does and
[1:29:29] fixes supper and her dad her and Dad sit
[1:29:32] down while that's the happiest time in
[1:29:34] Mama's life see her kitties all at home
[1:29:36] now don't miss don't be missing that day
[1:29:39] let the great chain of your family be
[1:29:41] hooked together link by link let every
[1:29:44] spoke be in the wheel and then when we
[1:29:46] sit down with our families and groups
[1:29:49] across the canopies of
[1:29:51] Eternity what a day that will be
[1:29:54] then we'll understand amen amen you s
[1:29:57] there with your families and groups
[1:29:59] across the canopies of Eternity cuz you
[1:30:02] remember when brother Brown went across
[1:30:03] a curtain of time he didn't see Paul he
[1:30:06] didn't see irenius what did the angel
[1:30:08] tell him he he said are these all
[1:30:10] brandom he said no they're your converts
[1:30:13] exactly so they were in a group y inside
[1:30:16] the sixth Dimension there's a group of
[1:30:18] people that come under bram's Ministry
[1:30:21] there's a group that come under Paul's
[1:30:22] irenius Martin Columba Moody any of
[1:30:26] those I mean they were born again but he
[1:30:27] must have not have been able to see them
[1:30:29] but he says right here their family and
[1:30:30] groups yeah across the canopies of
[1:30:33] Eternity all right let's go to the next
[1:30:36] one I think of sometimes how mothers
[1:30:38] will refuse to raise children bring up
[1:30:40] children and young women practicing
[1:30:41] birth control and buy a little dog and
[1:30:43] lead them around and you only realize
[1:30:44] lady that just about 20 years of your
[1:30:47] life that you have that God's lotted to
[1:30:48] you that you're going to be able to do
[1:30:50] this great Duty for God do you know your
[1:30:52] child might be a modern f or something
[1:30:54] like that do you realize just 20 about
[1:30:56] 20 years of your life is as long as you
[1:30:59] you'll be able to raise children and all
[1:31:01] through the eternities you'll enjoy the
[1:31:03] blessings of God if you bring a child in
[1:31:05] this world and raise it right that star
[1:31:10] that shining Yonder in glory you'll be
[1:31:11] associated with it see and then to
[1:31:14] refuse to raise the little fellas
[1:31:15] because you'd rather take your running
[1:31:17] around and carrying on that's ridiculous
[1:31:19] you shouldn't do that and now don't do
[1:31:20] it no sir don't you do it you be a happy
[1:31:22] person mothers of old they love to raise
[1:31:25] children but all this modern American
[1:31:26] day that we're living in now I tell you
[1:31:28] our nation is simply polluted there's
[1:31:30] not a hope left to this nation as I see
[1:31:33] only an oldfashioned Revival and
[1:31:34] according to the scripture it'll never
[1:31:37] be Nationwide right amen so they're done
[1:31:39] with that all right let's go to the next
[1:31:41] one all right preparing for children
[1:31:43] this is where I wanted to get
[1:31:46] to Psalms 127 3-4 and I want you to all
[1:31:50] perk
[1:31:52] up and wake up
[1:31:56] I don't have a problem with children
[1:31:58] sleeping the
[1:31:59] adults the ones that needs to be
[1:32:02] awake excuse me low children are a
[1:32:06] Heritage of the Lord and the fruit of
[1:32:07] the womb is his reward see you ought to
[1:32:09] see right there that that
[1:32:13] Moses wasn't talking about a piece of
[1:32:19] fruit
[1:32:20] right you're the fruit of your mother
[1:32:23] right so when Moses was writing the
[1:32:25] accounts of what happened in Genesis
[1:32:27] right Moses was the one who wrote The
[1:32:29] Genesis right he wrote Don't partake of
[1:32:32] that fruit yeah not an apple brother
[1:32:37] Chris the scriptures all through there
[1:32:39] tells you this you're the fruit of your
[1:32:42] mother so it's not an apple that they
[1:32:44] that she ate she partook of another type
[1:32:47] of fruit to make the fruit of her
[1:32:50] womb is his reward right as arrows are
[1:32:53] in the hand of a mighty man so are
[1:32:55] children of the youth all right keep
[1:32:59] going children's children of the crown
[1:33:02] of old men and the glory of children of
[1:33:04] their
[1:33:05] fathers all right just keep running
[1:33:07] through them this is scripture all for
[1:33:10] all for uh raising children but I'll get
[1:33:13] to something in just a minute tell ye
[1:33:15] your children of it and let your
[1:33:16] children tell their children and their
[1:33:18] children another generation how do you
[1:33:20] think before we had text messages and
[1:33:23] and computers and all that stuff how was
[1:33:25] stories
[1:33:27] told passed down through generation
[1:33:29] children to children children to
[1:33:31] Children the uh
[1:33:33] Indians the Indians kept all their
[1:33:35] history in here yeah the old Shaman
[1:33:39] would pass it down to the next guy that
[1:33:41] that that that listen our problem is
[1:33:43] that's what I said this morning you got
[1:33:44] to listen right right we got to listen
[1:33:47] listen to what God has to say all right
[1:33:50] Matthew 18 and I said verely I say unto
[1:33:52] you except you be converted
[1:33:54] and become as Little Children You shall
[1:33:56] not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:33:58] look how important to be to act like a
[1:33:59] little kid sometime whosoever therefore
[1:34:01] shall humble himself as this little
[1:34:03] child the same as greatest in the
[1:34:06] kingdom of heaven and whosoever shall
[1:34:08] receive one such little child in my
[1:34:11] name receiveth me amen all right let's
[1:34:14] go to Ephesians 6 and 4 and ye fathers
[1:34:17] provoke not your children to wrath but
[1:34:19] bring them up in the nurture and
[1:34:21] admonition admonition of the Lord this
[1:34:23] is what want to get to right here all
[1:34:25] right let's go the word nurture means to
[1:34:29] cultivate when we cultivate a crop we're
[1:34:31] constantly doing what needs to be done
[1:34:33] to see that that crop reaches maturity
[1:34:35] and produces what it should you don't
[1:34:37] just go throw seed out there and walk
[1:34:39] away and come back in two months later
[1:34:41] and expect a crop you're going to get a
[1:34:44] crop it's going to be weeds it's going
[1:34:47] to be this and that and the other it's
[1:34:48] going to be suckers it's going to be
[1:34:50] things that are growing that you don't
[1:34:51] want growing right so what does say the
[1:34:54] Bible say I'm not making this up the
[1:34:56] Bible says to
[1:34:59] nurture bring them up in the nurture and
[1:35:02] admonition of the Lord
[1:35:04] children it it requires constant
[1:35:07] awareness of what's happening to the
[1:35:09] crop in other words go look at
[1:35:11] it and it requires that the one doing
[1:35:14] the cultivating is involved daily with
[1:35:16] the crop you see a little thing pop up
[1:35:18] about this High
[1:35:20] correct that's a weed that's going to
[1:35:23] just keep keep on growing and take over
[1:35:25] if you don't cut it off when it's little
[1:35:28] mama used to have a little old bitty ho
[1:35:29] that thing probably wasn't hoes are
[1:35:31] usually about you know about like that
[1:35:33] about that wide she had that thing F
[1:35:35] down it would about that big but boy she
[1:35:36] could get under them plants and she can
[1:35:38] she can knock them uh suckers and all
[1:35:41] that other stuff out from under and not
[1:35:43] hurt the crop what was she doing she was
[1:35:45] cultivating she was waiting she was
[1:35:47] doing something to help her crop grow up
[1:35:49] to what maturity all right that's the
[1:35:52] same thing you and I are our
[1:35:54] responsibility is to raise our children
[1:35:56] in the nurture and admonition of the
[1:35:58] Lord that they will grow up and be
[1:36:00] mature right all
[1:36:03] right the crop must have the right
[1:36:05] environment Soil and Water also pulling
[1:36:08] of weeds and getting rid of the bugs
[1:36:09] that could harm the
[1:36:10] crop all right let's go to the next
[1:36:14] one Proverbs
[1:36:18] 13:24 this is what I didn't put in here
[1:36:21] the last time
[1:36:23] read the book of prover or the whole
[1:36:25] chapter in the Proverbs read the whole
[1:36:28] book and you'll get a lot about life he
[1:36:31] that spareth his Rod hateth his son
[1:36:35] yeah the Bible said he that spareth his
[1:36:38] Rod hateth his son
[1:36:42] yeah but he that loveth him
[1:36:46] chasteneth him many times
[1:36:50] right not just once yeah I'm telling you
[1:36:53] people I see some of you doing it you
[1:36:56] can't be a friend to your
[1:36:58] child you can let him grow up and be a
[1:37:01] friend later but you got to be a daddy a
[1:37:04] mama to those children you can't be
[1:37:07] friends amen being friend that friend
[1:37:09] well you know what friend does friend
[1:37:11] runs you to Mama and runs you to Daddy
[1:37:13] Daddy's going to whip you mama's going
[1:37:15] to love you mama's going to love you
[1:37:16] Daddy's going to whip you you got a
[1:37:17] battle back and forth that's jun's not
[1:37:21] she's sitting back there she'll tell you
[1:37:22] she a not that's probably been our only
[1:37:25] battle right only real battle is that
[1:37:31] I'm the bad
[1:37:33] guy right CU I'm the bad guy and she
[1:37:35] said right cuz she makes me the bad guy
[1:37:39] but don't do
[1:37:40] that don't do that don't support your
[1:37:44] children remember you're guilty kids
[1:37:46] until proven innocent
[1:37:49] yeah so says the parents of the United
[1:37:52] States of America
[1:37:53] yeah you're
[1:37:55] guilty if you're not guilty you're going
[1:37:57] to be guilty of something to get by with
[1:37:59] so like I said if I give you one that
[1:38:01] you rather didn't need you probably
[1:38:03] didn't get one that you should have got
[1:38:05] so you run out about
[1:38:11] even this is
[1:38:14] Bible he that spareth his Rod hateth his
[1:38:18] son you're doing them a disservice by
[1:38:21] letting them get by with that but he
[1:38:23] that loveth him chasteneth him many
[1:38:26] times or be times let's go to the next
[1:38:30] one Proverbs 231 13-14 withhold not
[1:38:34] correction from the child for if thou
[1:38:37] beatest him with a rod he shall not
[1:38:42] die
[1:38:44] Bible Thou shalt beat him with the rod
[1:38:47] that's two
[1:38:48] scriptures and shallal deliver his soul
[1:38:52] right from hell
[1:38:53] exactly that's
[1:38:56] Bible withhold not correction from the
[1:38:59] child if thou beatest him with a rod he
[1:39:02] shall not
[1:39:03] die there's two things they took out of
[1:39:05] school that really took this nation down
[1:39:07] that was prayer and whipping in school
[1:39:09] that's right amen you asked my sister
[1:39:12] back there little kids five or six years
[1:39:14] old telling her she's a blankety blank
[1:39:15] blank blank blank that wouldn't a happen

[1:39:21] graduated 1978 for those on the inter
[1:39:24] internet they was teachers that had
[1:39:26] paddles that had names on
[1:39:29] them they had names for these things
[1:39:32] they were this big and they would drill
[1:39:35] holes in them to keep the air yeah from
[1:39:38] getting between your high end in the
[1:39:40] board they drill holes in them and call
[1:39:42] them big
[1:39:44] Bera and the rod of Correction and they
[1:39:47] wouldn't just whip you like this I had
[1:39:50] one teacher Old Miss Haren she'd take
[1:39:51] that thing like a baseball bat oh what
[1:39:55] amen and she make you touch your toes
[1:39:57] and if you took your fingers off of your
[1:39:59] toes you got another one you you
[1:40:01] remember Miss Heron big old big big
[1:40:04] teacher oh my goodness anyway she was

[1:40:12] yeah and like I said I got a buy with
[1:40:14] something I should have got but I didn't
[1:40:16] get but Thou shalt beat him with a rod
[1:40:18] and shalt deliver his soul from hell now
[1:40:21] you're not going to that's not going to
[1:40:22] beating the child's not not going to
[1:40:23] save him but let's let's look at the
[1:40:26] next
[1:40:27] one train up a child in the way he
[1:40:30] should go and when he is
[1:40:33] old he will not depart from

[1:40:41] and when he is old he will not depart
[1:40:42] from it amen now I'm not telling you you
[1:40:45] know when it says beat your
[1:40:47] child that doesn't mean beat with

[1:43:04] how he starts out look how he starts out
[1:43:07] now here here's this is Solomon he had a
[1:43:10] thousand wives so he probably had a few
[1:43:12] kids in there yeah the fear of the Lord
[1:43:14] is the beginning of knowledge but fools
[1:43:17] despise wisdom and instruction that's
[1:43:20] what I'm trying to give you today

[1:47:32] the world that don't honor their mother
[1:47:33] and father and I know a bunch of
[1:47:36] them some of these kids said to my mama
[1:47:40] what they said to their

[1:47:44] few days I promise you

[1:47:56] thing's going to start
[1:47:58] hurting but I said about whipping you
[1:48:00] don't have to beat them with a rod like
[1:48:01] Daddy said it's a very good idea don't
[1:48:03] whip them in
[1:48:04] raft but take you a long switch and I
[1:48:07] don't know if anybody on the internet
[1:48:08] knows what a keen Hickory is but Keen
[1:48:10] means something that's
[1:48:13] real it's real narrow like a like a pen
[1:48:16] or a a needle but it's long and we have
[1:48:18] them here in America and U they're
[1:48:21] called hedge bushes and they grow big
[1:48:24] long leaders on them it's got Little

[1:48:43] of a pencil either they'll go out and
[1:48:45] pull it out from the Roo and with you
[1:48:47] with the whole tree right so you got to
[1:48:49] bring them a good one yeah cuz what
[1:48:51] happens is that thing goes to swishing
[1:48:53] and in a keen Hickory Hickory is wood
[1:48:57] and that's what that that's what that
[1:48:58] comes from but boy you talking about

[1:50:22] as many as I love I rebuke that's the
[1:50:25] this age is that right so and then the
[1:50:27] Bible said also in Hebrews the 12th
[1:50:29] chapter and 8th verse and if they cannot
[1:50:31] stand and won't take rebuke they are

[1:50:39] right go ahead illegitimate right pretty
