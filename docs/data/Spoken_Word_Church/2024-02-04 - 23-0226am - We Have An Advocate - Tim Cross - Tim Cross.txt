in his presence so wonderful to be able to worship that way and and sing the words of that song it's more than a song it's a reality to us amen we greet you greet you in the name of the Lord this morning you can be seated if you'd like and um appreciate brother Wade um extending an invitation to come and be with you this morning it really shows a lot of confidence when a when a pastor will open his Pulpit while he's away and then um but I guess he knew brother Samuel would be here to keep a close eye on me it's just wonderful to be with you this morning and uh feel very much like family to you all and um it's been a number of years since we were by here and so we thank the Lord he opened up another opportunity I did not bring my my wife and our little baby that we've just adopted with me this morning um at the church where we attend now uh to this morning was the first service in a new building that the Lord has given to us and we really thank the Lord for that we we bring greetings thank you amen bring you greetings from uh brother Josh Bennett our pastor pastor and uh yeah for the last 2 or 3 years we've been meeting in the uh gym of a wesleyian church uh when the covid restrictions were uh put into law we didn't have enough room which we were running out of room as it was so uh when they made the 6 foot distance rule uh Wesley and church very graciously offered us the the exclusive use of their gym building and uh so we converted it into a sanctuary and had been meeting there since I guess 2020 or whenever that all started so um it was a tough go but we it was really something because um the the wesling church itself had um their membership had declined they were somewhat struggling and uh when they saw this this group move in and begin worshiping in the gym um you know just in the way we do it it kind of inspired them to say as soon as y'all move out of that building uh we're going to bring in a younger pastor and we're going to change the format of our services and they they they saw I believe what they saw was a living reality lived out in the hearts of worshippers and so they're they're they're wanting to shift away from maybe the traditional format that uh they used and I just you know I really pray that something real God will bless them number one for allowing us the use of their building but you know without a revelation uh they can only aspire to have what we have and I don't say that in a condescending way I I pray that something will will strike their hearts and ignite them to bring them into the fullness the reality of who Jesus Christ is today amen because he is he is more he's more than what uh any man's box or boundaries can Define him to be he's a living moving reality and we're following the the same Pillar of Fire that the children of Israel followed under Moses leadership and then under Joshua's that same pillar fire is moving today and so uh we just thank the Lord for um uh the goodness and the grace he's shown to us and so not having brought my wife with me this morning uh they they asked me if I would maybe play a song on the piano and so um if they'll lock the doors in the back and keep everybody from making a mass Exodus um I I will do that maybe play a song and maybe even sing thing but uh it really is a a um it really is a privilege to be with you this morning and to see brother Samuel and his wife and uh just knowing that you know this we just have a few moments in time here on Earth but we're going to share eternity together again like we did before there was a creation so uh may the Lord bless you this morning just Worship the Lord with me [Music] how many of you recognize that song it's an old song but it has a great meaning I don't know if there's a microphone [Music] hands and theot Str and the voice that subdued the rough bows will be heard in Judea no no more but the path of that long G with joy I will follow today and the TOs of the road we'll see [Music] nothing when I get to the end of the way the TOs of the road will see [Music] nothing when I get to the end of the way there are so many Hills to climb [Music] upward I often am longing for rest but he who appoints me my [Music] pathway knows just what is needful and best you have that confidence this morning I know in his word he hath [Applause] promised that the strength it shall be as my day and the TOs of the road we'll see [Music] nothing when I get to the end of the way yes the TOs of the road will see nothing when I get to the end of the way I love the words to this verse he loves me too well to for forsake me or give me one trial too much all his people have been dearly purchased and Satan can never claim such by and by I shall see him and praise him in that city of unending day there the TOs of the road will see nothing when I get to the end of of the [Music] way when the last feeble step has been taken and the gates of that City appear and the Beautiful song of the Angels float out all my listening here when all that now seems so mysterious will be bright and clear as the day then the to of the road will see nothing when I get to the end of the [Music] way yes the TOs of the road will see nothing when I get to the end of the [Music] way amen get started singing and soong just go from one to the other but it'll be worth it all brother Samuel when we see Jesus amen God bless you we'll stand this morning turning our Bibles to 1 John Chapter 2 came down last night and um got to go out and have a little fellow fell ship with brother Aon and brother Bob and um we just really enjoyed that time of Fellowship together um just pray the Lord will you know when you get up here as a minister you realize you you you can't do anything or you can't say anything okay can't do anything in and of ourselves that would be of a help to you but what we're depending on is for him to come on the scene and he did promise in his word if two or three would Gather in his name that he would come and be right in our midst and that's what we're depending on this morning so just before we read his word maybe we could go to him in prayer if you have a need in your life today something you're Desiring from the Lord why don't you just approach him now in sincerity and ask him to come and you know there's power in his word and there's power in his presence and we have not gathered in vain he he didn't make those promises in vain but he's a living living reality and I believe he'll just come right Among Us this morning and minister to our needs Lord we just come before you this morning with Thanksgiving in our heart knowing Lord that your word is true we are your people we're the Sheep Lord of your pasture and Lord when you made the promise you knew that there would be a people on the Earth in this day Lord that would be so dependent and so reliant on you Lord that we can't make it without without you lord we go through many trials and I'm sure Lord the last time I was here none of us imagined we would even still be on the earth Lord in 2023 and we would have just come through Lord a worldwide pandemic and Lord there's been a lot of water go under the bridge a lot of tests a lot of Trials a lot of turmoil Lord and I'm sure your children this morning Lord are still in the heat of the battle but God we're depending upon you because you're the author author and the finisher of our faith Lord you said in your word he that began a good work in you will be faithful to perform it until the day of Jesus Christ that's what we're depending on this morning Lord as a mortal man I'm depending on you to come and move me aside and Lord break the bread of life to our hearts and do what Only You Can Do Lord we can read the words from the pages Lord but it takes you Lord to Quicken it and make it alive in our hearts and we ask you this morning Lord it it's such an honor for me to come and Lord see brother Samuel still standing here Lord as as a witness Lord of your resurrection power Lord see the work that you have ordained here in Lula Georgia and to see Lord there are people that are being drawn Lord to this light and Lord to the radiance of your word and God to know that when we go forth from this place today Lord we will be Jesus Lord to our our co-workers and our family and those that we come and contact with so we're asking you Lord to bring us into the holiest of holies Lord and give us a charge of your spirit Lord Lord refill us Lord and strengthen us Lord to walk this Christian Journey Lord Lord and to hasten the day when we can be joined Lord to you in reality Lord never to have to part again oh God may you grant it and may you bless brother Wade this morning as he's ministering Lord amongst the Believers there father God your spirit is omnipresent and Lord you have the power to go even where Lord others would be watching or listening in this morning God I pray your spirit would fill their homes in the places where they are Lord and raise them up and lift them up father God grant it we ask in Jesus name we pray for you to be glorified and honored in our midst Lord is our desire this morning may you grant it now in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen 1 John Chapter 2 we'll just read beginning here at verse number one I want to speak maybe for a title this morning we have an advocate amen we have an advocate and John writes here and he says my little children these things write unto write I unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments he that saith I know him and keepeth not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but who so keepeth his word in him verily is the word of God or is the love of God perfected hereby know we that we are in him amen and also in Hebrews chapter 4 uh Verses 4 through or 14- 16 seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need may the Lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated this morning you know I believe if there's anything or if there's one thing that we can do as Ministers of the Gospel is to lift up the name of Jesus Christ and to stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance and to exalt the Lord Jesus and lift him so high amen that it would take your vision or your eyes amen from the here and now or the the you know all the things that uh batter us and try to weaken our confidence in our faith but just to get our eyes on Jesus Christ amen in such a way that it would actually inspire faith in our hearts amen uh to mold us and to make us into his very image you know we are we are powerfully impacted by the things that we behold with our natural sight you know when uh when Jacob wanted to get the cattle to look a certain way he put those sticks in the water trops that were had these carvings on them and it it and it affected what was bursted forth from those cattle and so it's important what we fix our eyes on it's important what we devote our time and our attention to amen so in in this uh 45 or 60 or 90 or 120 Minutes we have here this morning amen I want to get our eyes fixed on Jesus Christ amen he said if I be lifted up I'll draw a men unto me amen he was that bruised serpent or that brass serpent that was lifted up there in the wilderness that if the believer could turn their eyes from their Affliction to amen sin judged amen it would have a miraculous healing effect amen amen expressed into their lives and so that's that's my desire this morning is just to lift LIF up Jesus Christ who is the revealed word of the hour amen I know this morning we're not worshiping a historical God from 2,000 years ago we're not worshiping a God that has been defined To Us by a religious system but we're worshiping a God who has become a living reality in our lives and we are his Witnesses here upon the Earth today amen so we realize in the Old Testament amen when the worshipper was given instructions under moses' Ministry amen they would bring a lamb or a sacrifice Amen to be offered Amen in their behalf as a covering or as a uh H something to atone on behalf of them because of their recognition of their sinful condition amen and a conscience of sin that had been realized upon Humanity after the transgression that was committed in the Garden of Eden by his first created son and daughter and so we realized that the worshipper would bring this lamb as an offering to to the high priest and the high priest was acting as a as an intermediary between the worshipper and Jehovah God because the worshipper could not approach God directly at that time amen and so the priest was there serving as a representation of something greater that would follow amen but he was there to take amen something that was offered in sincerity amen something that was offered amen wholeheartedly by the worshipper and he was to examine that amen before taking it before the Lord to be accepted and so that worshipper was waiting there brother Lis and anticipation to see what the high priest response would be or to see how he would return to them with some validation that the atonement had either been accepted or rejected because they realized when the atonement was accepted they were accepted it was their taking their place or it was uh uh something there as a substitute on behalf of the believer and we know that the priest was not examining the worshipper he was examining the lamb he wasn't amen it was already a known fact that the worshipper wasn't qualified they were Sinners amen they were worthy of death they were worthy of the Affliction of sickness amen whatever it was it was a known fact that they were a sinner amen so the priest was not Examining The Sinner but he was examining what the sinner was presenting as the atonement Amen on his behalf and we know that when that propitiation or when that lamb was accepted amen that priest would come back and give that believer that Assurance amen and that that faith and that confidence that Jehovah God Amen has seen what has been substituted on your behalf and he has accepted it and you are free to go and worship with that being released from your conscience amen so I I want to say this though amen the way that lamb was kept up and the way that lamb was cared for showed this sincerity and the dedication of the worshipper that's it amen that worshipper didn't just go out there on the on the the morning of the atonement and just grab up any old lamb and say come along I'm going to I'm going to offer you right amen he didn't just go uh it wasn't haphazard it wasn't uh just something he did as a formality there had to be some sincerity some dedication and some devotion there otherwise God would not receive it amen God would not honor it amen so it shows we must have a sincere approach to God and me if we approach God haphazardly or or if our worship Services just become a formality or if the only reason you come to church amen is to check a box that you have done your religious Duty for that day or for that week amen amen you're not short changing God you are short changing yourself you are missing because you will not get the fullness of the effect of that service and that worship because your approach amen is not incomplete sincerity so it does matter what your approach is and no matter how worthy your lamb is Amen in order for you to go away amen with a true heartfelt worship you must have a complete recognition of what that lamb has actually done on your behalf amen amen so the worshipper and I'm just laying a little bit of a foundation here this is my first time maybe to speak on this subject and I don't know how it'll go with everything I've got on my heart or or the time constraints but I I just want you just to pull on the word and ask God speak to me this morning amen the worshipper was prevented from entering the holiest of holies but the priest took that atonement on behalf of all who believe I believe there was a once a year amen that the priest would go on behalf of the entire Congregation of Israel amen now he wasn't doing this for Egyptians he wasn't doing this for amorites he wasn't doing this for people of other nations or other Origins but he was doing it on behalf of a selected group of people that God had chosen to be the Earthly representation of God's kingdom he sent them this prophet amen he gave them this message amen and so they had been gathered by a prophet's life and Ministry yes they had been gathered out of Egypt amen and so they had been uh segregated if you will or they had been uh uh isolated from the other nations and peoples of the Earth because they were an again an Earthly representation of what was in the mind of God Amen a spiritual Kingdom that God was reestablishing on the Earth even after the fall of the transgression in the in the in the Eden amen and so there it wasn't for everyone but it was for the believer it was for the chosen it was for those who had marched out of Egypt's bondage in an exodus amen back into the land that had been theirs all along you say theirs all along brother Tim yes they weren't reclaiming they weren't stealing land from someone else they were retaking the land that God had given to their forefathers Abraham amen but it took a prophetic Ministry brother Samuel to reconnect them to their true origin their true spiritual Heritage when they were in Egypt they had been reduced to Slaves amen they had become a subcategory or a subass of people but a prophet's Ministry amen reminded them that before you in Egypt's bondage God made a promise to your father Abraham and he was there to reconnect him brother the Louis to their true Heritage and lead them out of Egypt back into their land to dispossess every squatter who had occupied that territory thinking that was their own I want to tell you this morning you're not taking the devil's salvation you're not taking the devil's healing you're taking yours back but there has to be a revelation in your heart that says that is mine it belongs to me God gave it to me and you have to drive off every squatter amen Hallelujah you know some people and I'm I'm veering off my notes here but some people seem to be uh afraid or scared amen or they're they're they're hesitant to recognize what being a child of God how exclusive that makes you but it's true for every Christian Christians are a segregated group right they are isolated from the world come out from among them and touch not the unclean thing that has always been amen and Jesus himself stood on Earth and said I am the way the truth and the life no man come to the father by me so what I'm trying to show you this morning is you don't have to be embarrassed in what God has foreordained you and and made you to be as children of the Living God you're not like the world and you're not supposed to be like the world you can't blend with the world Amen but we've been caught out as a separated people so this is an exclusive message amen this is an exclusive Ministry that has come to the Earth to call a people Amen to call a bride out of church enity amen and so just your ability to recognize that call and identify to it and be transformed by it is a great blessing and and friend it it it it doesn't make us anything I don't I don't want to sound like an elitist this morning I'm not an elitist I'm a sinner saved by grace but what Grace makes me and what the grace of God restores me to in my placing as a Son of God and as a daughter of God Amen should not be undermined by unbelief or a failure to recognize what God has imputed to you as the Earthly expression of his glory and his righteousness that's what gives him glory I've told this story uh years ago when I was a child we went to a to a church and there was a man there he had come out of prison he I don't know what he'd been accused of but uh he very much had lived a uh some portion of his life incarcerated for crimes he had committed and so then when he came out he married he was a Believer and he married a Believer amen there in the church a sister and I said I I I pardon me if this sounds crude but Brother Sam I said you could always know when he had arrived in the service you always knew when he was there because his wife that he had married just just a young sister am me he always dressed her in the nicest of clothes and she always had the nicest perfumes that she would wear and so as soon as she would walk into the doors of the sanctuary the the odor of that perfume would begin to feel the sanctuary and you would know she has arrived and you would know he has arrived and he was a poor man it was a he was a plain man he I think he was a Woodcutter something like that worked in the tree industry amen he would dress simple look simple I believe he had an eyebrow removed or something maybe' been a gang member something there an expression but you see all of his glory amen all of his wealth all of his status amen was being carried on display by his bride and it took nothing away from him but it was actually how he chose to channnel who he was she was the expression of that amen and she didn't have to wear a wedding band although she did she didn't have to walk around saying hey I'm married I got a husband amen I I know she just moved and walked without saying a word she was dressed in something she was adored in something that told everybody I'm taken that's right I'm married I've got a protector I've got a provider I belong to somebody I am somebody's wife his glory was being expressed through her oh my if that is not a picture of the Bride of Jesus Christ oh I'm off my notes now but I'm just going to preach I feel at home every creature God formed in the Garden of Eden the male was the most beautiful until God made something in his own image Adam was formed from the dust of the Earth with the more beautiful part of himself contained in his side as a mystery showing what Christ would do in all the lower forms of creation the glory and the beauty and the and the Splendor was expressed in the male creature but when God made something in his image the more beautiful part was still in side as a mystery but when Adam grew lonely and began to desire amen Fellowship communion with something of equal intelligence and power God removed now not from the dust of the earth brother Samuel but he reached right into Adam's side and he made her out of the same material that Adam was made of and he said this is now bone of my bone this is Flesh of My Flesh life of my [Applause] life Hallelujah and the more glorious the more beautiful expression of him was his bride Hallelujah and he said in Isaiah there is no beauty that we should desire him he was smitten he was bruised he was broken amen he was uh amen he was rejected he was despised by the world he was acquainted with grief a Man of Sorrows but what came forth from his side was a revelation of his actual worth his value and he was glorified in a people on the face of the Earth hallelujah praise the lord well I'm way off my notes but but see and and it's not who we are but it's who we are that gives us our worth and our value because in and of ourselves brother Bob we're nothing we're nothing without him I've talked about a a stock you know there's there's companies that their stock value holds Great Value I I maybe Microsoft or the Boeing Corporation or IBM computers or some of these great you know recognized names among stock Traders but you know I said you could go today and you you could be a millionaire and say I'm going to buy a million doll worth of Boeing stock and I don't know that it would increase the value of the stock at all it would just mean you own a million dollars worth of shares but there are investors who have a known history of making good Investments based on their assessment of not only a Stock's present value but its f fut value and so when a man like Warren Buffett amen when it is even rumored that he has an interest in a stock the value begins to climb it isn't even the stock itself but the fact that an investor who never makes an unwise investment has shown an interest in it raises the value so the value you are not worth very much in and of yourself but somebody took an interest in you one day someone who has never made a bad investment reached down into the dust of the earth and he saw potential he saw his own value expressed in you and he justified you to sanctify you to fill you with the Holy Ghost and glorify you that he could display you as the product of of what he is able to do hallelujah amen it makes me want to sing makes me want to shout makes me want to run a laer in this place because when I looked at my brother there I saw no value I saw a worthless creature brother Louise but when he looked at me brother Samuel he saw himself he saw something there Hallelujah that could give him glory praise the Lord praise the Lord amen and and that's why I give him glory that's why I worship him that's why there's something welling up inside of me Hallelujah that no matter that you know the world they don't understand but they've never experienced what we've experienced if they could only feel what we feel and he can be to them brother Joe the living reality he is to us he wouldn't be a mystery to them right amen so an advocate Webster defines an advocate as one who pleads the cause of another and specifically one who pleads the cause of another before a tribunal or a Judicial Court and then we we we saw the word propitiation there and propitiation is the act of gaining or regaining the favor or Good Will of someone or something something something that propitiates or appeases specifically an atoning sacrifice so it's something that meets the threshold of satisfaction for a higher authority amen that has demanded something to reconcile the difference that has been created by the transgression oh Hallelujah I hope we get to it this morning amen man you know my wife and I we we adopted a little baby girl uh she turned to just after Thanksgiving and the adoption was finalized but you know when you go to adopt a child it's it's a legal process and so uh the the the county uh or the state they actually have the care and the custody of that child and that child has an advocate that child has a guardian ad Li him amen Who was appointed by the court because that child amen is a newborn amen cannot speak has no way to express itself has no way to defend itself has no way to express its interest or desires so a guardian at Liam is appointed amen as an advocate to speak and represent the interest of that child into a court with the jurisdiction or the authority Hallelujah to determine the outcome of that child's life and so there there's another separate matter that we've been involved with that involves Court proceedings and and uh it's it's kind of a land dispute or a boundary dispute and so we were in the court one day and my if you've ever seen something that will startle you and Amaze you you ought to go see how court proceedings take place and all the all the craziness that goes on in the courtroom but you know one one thing you realize very quickly no matter how right you are or no matter how wrongfully you've been treated treed standing there speaking on your own behalf gets you almost nowhere in a court of law we were there in one of the early proceedings and I mean I I won't go into the details of it but to us it was plain as a nose on your face we have been wronged by a neighbor but you know what that judge and that court and all those attorneys and all those all those people there amen uh uh you are you are a pitiful helpless and defenseless party without legal representation we were there in one of the early proceedings and there was a a a sheriff's deputy that was there I think it was a BFF or just one of the deputies keeping order in the courthouse and he was mouthing to us get an attorney get yourself a lawyer and and brother and sister it wasn't easy to find a lawyer I went into the Yellow Pages I called two or three attorneys and everyone them said well we don't deal in these type of matters we don't specialize in this type of case we can't help you and they would refer me to others and they'd say well yes I I I used to do that but I don't do it this morning we were getting pasted from one to the next to the next to the next till finally we found somebody who was willing to take our case Hallelujah I am so thankful we found somebody who was willing to take our because we cannot approach the courts of God we cannot approach the great judge amen without representation amen because I've never gone to law school I don't know how the County laws work and the state laws and all these statutes and all these cases where precedent has been established amen for me to do that I would have had to go to study and digging through books amen trying to make all these loose connections and the judge wouldn't care to hear anything I said but brother and sister sister when we got an advocate when we got an attorney retained it didn't matter how many things were arriving in our mailbox it didn't matter how many papers were being served it didn't matter how many court hearings were being scheduled amen I passed all of that stress all of that worry all of that trouble on to the shoulders of an advocate hallelujah hallelujah I didn't even have to come to court in any longer he said I'm going to show up on your behalf I'm going to speak on your behalf from now on any accusation any papers anything that serve you just send it up to me Hallelujah let me tell you young person you don't have to speak to Satan you don't have to listen to his lies you don't have to be amen overwhelmed you don't have to be afraid you have an advocate and when you recognize ize that you've got an advocate acting on your behalf you direct everything you direct all correspondant to the attorney hallelujah hallelujah pass it All to Jesus Christ tell Satan I don't belong to myself anymore I don't speak for myself anymore I can't even defend myself he's doing it all on my behalf if you don't like it Satan take it up with him I didn't call myself I didn't choose myself I didn't for ordain myself I responded to someone who was interested in taking my case on my behalf all correspondents from now on Amen we had I mean you wouldn't have believed it brother and sister it was all it was almost like every two weeks I was having to cancel my appointments uh tell my work I've got another the court case I've got another hearing and if you're not there brother that does not bode well if you don't appear in court but you you're it's like it's almost like you're assumed guilty are you you the the judge does not rule in your favor but when when I got an attorney when I got an advocate he said you don't have to appear today I'm going I'll call you if I need you amen he was there and you see the thing about it is he has an in he has contacts he has connections with the court system with the judge you know if it's a traffic ticket or it's something you are actually guilty of those attorneys know which judges are serving on which days and they know which judges are the most lenient towards Speeders shoplifters whatever it may be and they'll get your case postponed or or or held until a judge is sitting there that is favorable to something you're actually guilty of because you have an advocate and he has a connection to the judge he also knows the other attorneys I'm not trying to give you an education on the on the broken court system but there was one day we showed up and and and there's our attorney I didn't even know he was going to be there and he said yeah yes I'm here that I'm your attorney now that's what I'm here to do is represent you and I said well wonderful but the other party didn't show up neither did their attorney and I said oh my praise God we're going to get a victory here today and they're either going to be thrown out of court or thrown in jail for failure to appear but you know what that other party's attorney had placed a phone call to the a district attorney or one of the pargal and she said my my daughter has a toothache and I got to take her to the dentist this morning I can't be there and they got the case postponed without her even being present because they've got connections and it doesn't seem fair and I told my I I I told my attorney I said look if this happens again somebody's going to jail if I've got to show up for these hearings and they don't have to come or even their uh representation come if this happens again somebody is going to jail but then he reminded me what if the shoe were on the other foot and there was a time we got the case postponed but uh because we were away ministering out out west somewhere so you know they try to keep some form of justice but the attorney speaks on behalf of the client amen so can I present to you this morning Jesus Christ amen our Prophet priest and and King Glory Hallelujah Paul are picks it up in Hebrews and he's talking about the priest said and he said for it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood and yet it is far more evident for after the similitude of MDC there ariseth another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life so he's actually showing a priesthood that holds a Supremacy over the levitical priesthood which was a type or Shadow pointing to something greater to follow for there is verely a disannulling of the Commandment going before the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God and in as much as not without an oath he was made priest for those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him that said unto him the Lord swear and will not repent thou art a priest Forever After the order of MDC amen by so much was Jesus made aurity of a better Testament amen and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continu with ever hath an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such an high priest became us who is Holy harmless undefiled separate from Sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those High priests who offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he wants he did once when he offered up himself for the law maketh men High priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated forever more amen he was offered up on Calvary amen he was placed within a tomb he rose on that third and glorious Easter morning and he appeared unto his disciples unto Mary oh I love it I'm going to just divert for just a moment you know on that glorious Resurrection morning Mary went out early in the morning to Worship the Lord for the final time and I love this and I want you to catch this is because we should never uh we should we should not come to church for what it can do for us she was approaching the Lord Jesus whom as far as she knew was dead deceased and could never do more for her but it did not stop her from wanting to do one more thing for him amen that's a real worshipper they're coming to to to they're approaching him in worship not for what it will do for them but for what they can do in appreciation for what he's already done for them am and so she came to the tomb and found it empty and she went back I think this is in St John 20 you'll read this she goes back and gets Peter and John and they come also to the tomb and go inside and see the same scene that she saw and turned and walked away they went back to their despair they went back to their despondent condition they went back to what you know when when Jesus was taken from them in a bodily form they fell away very quickly because they did not have the Holy Spirit within them to Anchor them but Mary had a different Zeal she had a different approach she had a different determination and to her it didn't matter what the others were doing she had come there with a purpose and she was not going to leave until her desire had been fulfilled are you seeing that this morning amen she didn't care what the reproach is she didn't care what the reputation is didn't we hear the message this morning the reproach for the cause of Christ many are leaving in this hour because of a reproach amen or what appears to be our reproach to the message to Jesus Christ revealed to us in word form but for Mary amen nothing could change her mind nothing amen could deter her away from the reality of what Jesus Christ meant to her Hallelujah so she remained there brother Louise at the place she had last been in his presence amen she stayed there steadfast unmoving amen unshakeable amen I came here to meet him and I'm going to stay here until I do and only moments after the ministers walked away two angels appeared in the same place they had all three just been oh my friend determination persistence when it's a derivative of faith will bring results she said I don't care what this does for anybody else I know what it's done for me and you know something she had precious spices she had precious ointments she had things that in the world had value they had meaning amen they had worth but to her it didn't mean anything unless it brought her into his presence we can have buildings we can have programs we can have fine things but it's worthless without him amen a reputation a past the history is worthless without his living presence Among Us amen we're only worshiping the memories amen of a day gone by and God does not expect us to live Hallelujah in the fake Aid of something that gone in the past God is not a prophet of 50 years ago or five years ago he is the I am God he's a God today and when you come with that expectation I came here to meet God and I'm not going to leave until I come in contact with him then some angels appeared some angels appeared to direct her Hallelujah there is a real five-fold ministry that's on the Earth today to direct you into contact with the living Jesus Christ amen he is the god of William brandham but he's also the god of the Bride of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Our Prophet priest and King 2 Corinthians 5:21 says for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we we might be made the righteousness of God in him see Mary was bringing those those sacraments she was bringing those spices those precious ointments but she said they're worthless unless they're on him he is what gives it its worth He is what gives this service value he is what gives you coming here today that's why you came you didn't come to see a building you didn't come to see one another you didn't care he come to hear a man expound you come to meet Jesus Christ and when that expectation resides in your heart as a living reality you won't walk away disappointed you won't walk away until it's been fulfilled and then like Mary you carry this message back he's alive he's risen I met him it's not a story it's not a fable he's not a memory of the past he's alive and well living in me to tell amen Romans 3:20 says therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for the law is the knowledge or the conscience of sin but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon them all that believe for there is no difference pardon me I keep reaching down turn off my for there is no difference right the fall in Eden established a difference but everything don't forget this quote that the prophet of God gives us everything the first Adam lost or forfeited in the fall the second Adam restored Satan created a difference when he made Eve unbelief but God removed the difference when he became our sin our propitiation he became everything that we had become so that we could become everything we had been in his mind amen as his attributes over the expression of his life amen before the foundation of the world we're being restored friend not to a new identity but to an original identity amen that gives us amen kingship with God Hallelujah remember he was a kinsman redeemer showing Not only was he our kin but we were his Redemption means to buy something back that was fallen from its original estate or its original worth but he came to redeem he came to seek and save those that were lost oh my friend do you see it this morning amen the righteousness of God that means it's God's which is by faith of Jesus Christ can I tell you this morning you don't even have your own faith you have his he has imparted his faith to you by the decree of his word and when you accept that word into a beding ground of Faith Hallelujah it attaches you and it creates an inseparable able Bond I'm moving quickly but it's I just I just feel like I could run a lap around this place the righteousness of God which is by the faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon them all that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Jesus in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be a propitiation that's satisfying the requirement amen how many say this morning Calvary satisfied the requirement amen we were identified there in him and remember friend you were judged in him you were in Christ when he was judged on Calvary for the sins he did not commit but you did and being joined to him and being contained within him in symbolic form amen he took our judgment amen wrapped it up in himself amen and then released a bride amen as the proof of his victory as the proof that it was amen a a a valid atonement with results can you say Amen oh my God help us a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare who righteousness does that make you self-righteous does that make you go around oh I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm in the club no it's not a club it's a family that you've been joined into by the blood purchase amen hallelujah to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus now I think that brother Bob was in the Sunday School lesson this morning may have just touched on the difference between Cain's approach and Abel's approach Abel's approach was an approach resulting from Revelation it was the it was the the fruit of a revelation that made him offer blood because somehow he knew blood was in the transgression and it would take blood to restore him back but Cain thought it was works he thought he could manufacture something that would appease the requirement of God and I just say this because he was not an expressed attribute of God all he could get was a legalistic revelation or a legalistic grasp of what God's requ now don't tell me Cain wasn't sincere he was sincere he was trying to regain God's favor but he never had it in the first place so even when God spoke to him lip to ear and said Cain if you'll do as your brother you'll be accepted he could not do it am you cannot make a Believer out of an unbeliever unless there's something on the inside amen which resonates when the word of God is presented and that that is that is the re I hope I'm not straying or or I hope I'm not getting too far out of the limb here but it it is the reconnection of the family of God amen here on the earth it is the very his very Kingdom being reestablished in the earth a justifier of him which believeth in Jesus where is boasting then it is excluded that's right by what law of Works nay but by the law of Faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law that's it now let me ask you this do Works follow does righteousness follow does holiness follow does a Sanctified consecrated life follow absolutely that is the proof amen that is a proof that you are under the atonement is when the life of the atonement expresses itself through you which shows a change from the man or woman you were in the old life now a new life has been born in you and you are a witness of that resurrected life whereas on the other it's just trying to manufacture oh if I can just be a better Christian or if I can be you know a more faithful church member I can pay more I can do more penants or all I I'll climb the climb the steps with broken glass friend that doesn't gain God's favor that's right amen Revelation is a realization that you had God's favor all along amen and that he has washed you in his own righteousness to remove that state amen of what Satan was trying to attach to you amen but was unsuccessful because Jesus Christ strips it away oh my I'm just all over the place now but they brought a woman to Jesus one day that they had caught in the act of adultery and they weren't doing it for any justice to be served but they were doing it to give opportunity to condemn the Lord Jesus they were tempting him right with the case they brought this woman caught in the act of adultery to Temp Jesus they had no interest in her they had no interest in her salvation they wanted to take the Lord in a snare so what did he do he began he knelt and he began writing in the St something about what he wrote made them all forget what had brought him there made them uncomfortable in his presence and they all Departed except for her nothing about his presence made her uncomfortable amen and when all the accusers had left he stood and said woman where are thy accusers where are the accusations that were levied against you before you came into my presence can you follow that she said I have none Lord amen they've all been dismissed they were having a court session right there a court session was being conducted and they thought that they had called the session but what they didn't realize was he had for ordained the session Amen to bring her back to the realization of who she had been all along and he said neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more amen now do you think she went out of that place oh I sure hope I can avoid a life of prostitution I sure hope I can live holy and righteous I'm going to try with everything that's in me to be a good Christian no it wasn't a decree or a demand with the expectation that she would fulfill it but it was a decree of his word which is power to transform when he was saying go and sin no more he was not asking her in and of herself to go and conduct a sinless life but he was giving her the protection of his word go and sin no more he was imputing unto her the power of a sinless life which comes from the decree amen of the of the highest supreme authority in the Kingdom Jesus was operating in the trifold manifestation of a prophet a priest and a king so he was placing a Royal Decree over her life amen to keep her in a sinless state until he could go and die on Calvary and send back the Holy Spirit which being enjoyed to her would enable him to live his sinless life through her hallelujah oh Hallelujah I just called caught a good nugget right here nobody else was present when he made that decree except perhaps the writer of that gospel all the doubt had been dismissed all of the false accusations had been dismissed they were in a secret chamber where she received a Royal Decree which empowered her with his power and his Divine characteristics were bestowed upon her Glory Hallelujah the world doesn't understand it they cannot comprehend it it has no meaning or Worth to them but to us it's everything Hallelujah you love the Lord this morning Philippians 3:9 and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith amen that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death I want to try to come to a close here but I was just touching on it and there's a lot of depth to what I'm saying here and and I don't have really a Teaching Ministry and it wouldn't even be my place you've got some great Ministries among you that can take these things and break them down or flush them out but I I do want to say this I want to I want to venture out just a bit here I believe I'm not venturing outside of what this church has been taught but in the end time revealing of the son of man we have the ministry of Jesus Christ coming to Earth again in a trifold expression of the offices of prophet priest and King the ministry amen of the son of man was not only the office of a prophet bringing forth extracting and divinely revealing now remember Only God Can reveal his word a man can't do it Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto you but my Father which is in heaven so it is the distinct privilege of the holy spirit amen prophetic uh manifestation or expression of God to reveal his word to the individual and not only to reveal it to them in an understanding but an actual expression of that word right amen amen just as Peter came out of the upper room now think about this before the upper room experience almost everything Peter said Jesus had to back it down right get behind me Satan even when he spoke on the Mount of transfiguration a voice overshadowed him said this is my beloved Son but when Peter came out of the upper room now it wasn't Peter speaking out of his own mind it was the Holy Spirit speaking through Peter which connected him to a prophecy yes and he stood there there unashamed Unapologetic where only days before he would apologize anytime he was pressed oh I'm not one of those disciples he would he would try to disassociate because he only had a caral understanding but when the holy spirit filled him it connected him to the prophecy and when they said what meanthis Peter said these men are not drunk as you suppose seeing it's the third hour of the day but this is that that was spoken by the prophet Joel he realized what was once a potential what was once a prophecy was now a reality and it made him stand very squarely on that promised word and say I'm not backing up it's not me manufacturing it it's him bringing the prophet's message to pass in my my life hallelujah amen so um let me just see if I can express this the way it came to me as a prophet he's reestablishing our origin and our destiny as priest he's returning from the holiest of holies to declare our acceptance remember when he went beyond the curtain of TI they said if you are accepted and you will be you will I'm paraphrasing but you you will lead us in they were coming in Under the Umbrella of the prophet's Ministry so he as the high priest amen was returning to show us amen the way to beyond the curtain of time amen was uh traversable by the believer amen whether you go by the way of the Grave or you part of the alive and remain you have been extended the golden scepter of God's grace to welcome you into his divine presence amen and he said and they and they testified those who were gathered they said we're already here enjoying this until the rest of those amen who come to Christ through your ministry join us here and then we'll all go right into his presence Hallelujah and as king he's issuing a Royal Decree to declare our true worth and that there is no difference and he's inviting us to be seated with him in his throne remember brother BR said he's coming now as a lion calling for his Queen to come stand by his side that comes to us through this message it's an exclusive message no former no Prophet no prior age took us to this level or to this understanding amen of what was in the word of God the entire time amen but it took the the ministry of the son of man it took the revealing of Christ through the office of a prophet Amen to to extract these truths from the Bible and to hand them to us for our acceptance Hallelujah and we like Mary say be it unto me according to the word to Thy word let this word find beding ground find a resting place in my heart that I may birth it forth you believe that this morning you know I I'm going to share this because I feel a liberty to say it when those sons of Aaron were consecrated to the priesthood there were all kinds of rituals there were all kinds of things they had to do in washing themselves sanctifying themselves the garments had to be a certain way there were all of these very uh detailed specifications that they had to follow to the letter to be able to serve God in that office of a priesthood but Moses as a prophet of God was able to ascend up onto the mountain where the holy presence of God Abode without any of that ritual it was the difference in the office that gave him the exclusive privilege and I say exclusive amen but God invited Moses into its presence to show him a pattern of something that God wanted carry out on the earth within the people right follow this brother and sister because Moses couldn't build the Tabernacle amen but he was taking a Divine pattern from the mind of God to the people of God to where the gifts that res resided in their lives could be expressed to build what was only a thought in God's mind and make it a living reality on Earth but it took the prophet's Ministry to carry the mind of God to the people of God and and I love this because you know Pharaoh just saw them as MD dobers in a land with all the riches and the wealth that Egypt had and they couldn't hardly stomp out good mud bricks amen but those same people got out here on the back side of the desert with nothing but sand and Deadwood and built a temple and God said I have placed gifts within the lives of these men Moses amen that your ministry amen will open up you preach them this pattern and it will awaken or Quicken these gifts to construct from their lives and from their substance that is around them this Tabernacle for for God's glory to come and dwell in oh my what does a prophet's Ministry do it quickens you to what was in you all the time but you were under the wrong leadership you were under a pharaoh you were under an Egyptian scheme you are under a false Kingdom but when you come under the prophet's Ministry you begin expressing things and You Begin transforming ordinary things around you into something that God can come and dwell in oh my praise the Lord isn't it beautiful and Moses could go and invite Joshua and the Elders of Israel to come into that mount and experience God's presence too without the garments and the washing and the blood of bulls and goats and all of those sanctimonious you see being joined to the prophet's Ministry gives you the privilege of being ushered into God's very Presence by what has been allocated to that ministry as God's desire it's important friend because that doesn't happen for the other nations of the world that happens for a call out people right amen I just want to say this to this morning I'm throwing this in I see it's 12:00 and I'll be closing there's no path back to Egypt friend we only got this far under God's Divine protection and we won't go back with that Divine protection so the only way for us to go is forward and if God takes the vessel off the scene God will raise up the same Ministry expressed in a manifold form to follow the pillar of fire on into what Moses Ministry made possible did you hear that there is a Joshua Ministry on the Earth today amen who fully joined to Moses message will place the bride spiritually in the Canaan land to give you the the to give you the strength and the courage to displace every devil that stands between you and your promise amen with no disregard to the prophet's message this is the compliment to the prophet's message that it has enacted it has awakened it has quickened these potentials within the body of Christ which God is joining his very presence to hallelujah our Advocate we have an advocate we have representation this morning we're not a despised put down people we're the Queen of Heaven God has sent a message to declare that to us you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect you are The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of God Called Love whatever you are you are Servants of God whatever God wants want you to do where your place is God placed in the church some Apostles prophets teachers pastors he placed that by virtue of his own predestination and you were that to begin with can you say amen amen your first wedding was an olded it was You' never done it in the first place because there's only one thing could do it that would be God come down himself and took your place place in the form of the Son of God Jesus Christ and washed you by the water of the washing of the Water by the word amen you know what and if they want to come back to the music prepare brother Bob there was a a little girl who lived in the Old Testament by the name of Esther a Hebrew and when Queen vashy refused to come before for the kingdom and display the king's Glory she was removed as Queen and opportunity was given for another to be raised up and Esther was selected now that King what was his name aashis aashis did not know who this little virgin girl actually was he just knew there was something amen that radiated from her that made her a distinguished young lady in the kingdom and was the only one that did not require makeup high heels the Fashions of the world or anything else to give her value her value came from who she was and she required nothing other than what the king's chamberlains appointed her which I believe represented The Messengers to the ages they dressed the Bride of each age and all that was needed for her to be presented and accepted in God's sight so the king put her on the throne as his Queen not knowing who she actually was and as the conspiracy developed because of hmon who was a high-ranking official in the Kingdom he recognized his Reign was under the threat the threat of of a specific class of people who refus to bow to him that's right and when morai refused to Bow amen a decree was given that all who refused to Bow and this was an irreversible decree it could not be reversed it could not be removed from the writings that if they refused to Bow they would be punished by death and it was a decree that was designed to extinguish the Hebrew people and hmon not recognizing that Esther was one friends let me say this your power lies in the identification of who you are and as long as it remains a secret you are a victim you are under the threat of an irreversible decree until you have the courage to stand up and speak out and say I am a Hebrew I am one of gods I had value Asus before you saw value the value I have isn't the value that you assigned to me when you made me your queen I had value before that that preempts what you have recognized and under the instructions of her uncle Mori he said you cannot keep your identity a secret otherwise you will perish and all of your people will perish but can I say this this morning if you will have the courage to come out of the closet and be identified as a Christian a Bible believing Blood Bought sin freed Christian son and daughter of God that identity is preminent above any other king any other Throne or any other power and when she made her Origins known to that King he did not reverse his decree but he gave her his protection he gave her protection to shelter her from the power of a decree that would have otherwise killed her and any who refused to Bow so so by realizing you're a daughter of God the Queen of Heaven you are under a Divine protection that offsets the Judgment you were born under all have sinned and come short of the glory of God but you are under the Divine protection of his decree that is made known because of his love to you and I want to tell you he hasn't given up to half of his kingdom he has given you a seat in his Throne we don't need closet Christians we don't need closet message Believers we need boldness to step out on faith and say I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I am proud of the Heritage that God has given me and I'm standing here on the Earth today as a witness that he's alive and well amen we have an advocate this morning oh Hallelujah would you like to stand to your feet
