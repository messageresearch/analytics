[34:57] Deuteronomy
[34:59] 1 these are the words which Moses spake
[35:01] unto all Israel let's just go with verse
[35:03] one on this side Jordan now this is
[35:05] where Moses is talking to him on this
[35:07] side Jordan this side of the Jordan all
[35:10] right in the wilderness in the plain
[35:12] over against the Red Sea between pan and
[35:14] toal and la and Lebon and herzo and
[35:19] diad the there are 11 days journey from
[35:22] Horeb by the way of Mount SE unto kades
[35:25] barnea and it came to pass in the 40th
[35:28] year on the 11th month on the first day
[35:31] of the month that Moses spake to the
[35:32] children of Israel according to all that
[35:34] the Lord had given him in commandment
[35:36] unto them after he had slain Zion the
[35:38] king of the amorites which dwelt in hbon
[35:41] and OG the king of Bashan which dwelt at
[35:43] asth in Ed on this side Jordan in the
[35:48] land of Moab began Moses to declare this
[35:51] law on this side
[35:52] Jordan on this side right all right in
[35:56] the land of Moab remember the moabit
[35:59] people he was in the land of Moab began
[36:01] Moses to declare this law saying the
[36:03] Lord Our God spake to us in Horeb saying
[36:06] ye have dwelt long enough in this Mount
[36:10] turn ye and take your journey and go to
[36:12] the Mount of the amorites and to all the
[36:14] places now there unto in the plains the
[36:16] hills the veils the South by the seaside
[36:18] to the land of the Canaanites and
[36:21] Lebanon and to the Great River the river
[36:22] Euphrates behold I have set the land
[36:25] before you go in and possess the land
[36:28] which the Lord swear unto your fathers
[36:30] Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto
[36:32] them and to their seed after them you
[36:36] may be seated and the Lord his Blessing
[36:38] to the reading of the word but he told
[36:40] him he said go you have dwelt long
[36:42] enough go in go in and possess amen all
[36:47] right God had given them that land when
[36:50] he promised it to Abraham correct he
[36:53] told Abraham anywhere the soul of your
[36:54] feet go that's where you're going to
[36:56] possess the people are going to possess
[36:57] that land cuz they gave it to Abraham
[36:59] Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to
[37:01] their seed after them all right and I've
[37:04] said many times before and I was saying
[37:05] this morning in the Sunday school class
[37:08] let's be warned of one
[37:10] thing you and I must go and possess a
[37:14] land but it's not a land like they did
[37:16] in the in the um ages we know that's the
[37:20] type of the Holy Ghost correct right the
[37:22] promised land is the type of the baptism
[37:24] of the Holy Ghost but you and I even
[37:26] being in the land being in that part of
[37:29] the
[37:31] land we have a a higher calling amen
[37:34] right not just to go in and possess the
[37:36] land what did Joshua do he didn't just
[37:38] go in and possess the land but he
[37:39] positionally placed each person in the
[37:41] land right had to fight for everything
[37:44] every inch of ground but God gave him
[37:47] that land well you and I have a land
[37:49] it's a land that's not been given to
[37:51] anyone else and it's a land that where
[37:54] you and I must possess it but we're not
[37:55] going to die and give give it to another
[37:58] generation okay we're not giving it to
[38:00] another church age I was telling them
[38:02] this morning if you ever realize them
[38:04] we're going to read in the Book of
[38:04] Joshua chapter 24 there was seven ites
[38:08] that Joshua had to deal with in that
[38:10] land we'll read
[38:13] them hites Hittites jebusites pites
[38:16] there was seven it's kind of strange
[38:18] there was seven that that Joshua had to
[38:20] deal with in the land in the land not
[38:23] going to the land he didn't have to find
[38:24] his
[38:25] way gave him everything and they had to
[38:28] get through Jordan and they had to get
[38:29] into the land and then the fighting
[38:31] began right I don't understand why
[38:33] people can't realize that that I didn't
[38:36] have a fight until I got in Promised
[38:38] Land you didn't have a fight did you
[38:40] fight when you were going to do things
[38:42] that and all things just flowed right
[38:43] out of your mouth you just grabbed what
[38:45] you wanted to you lusted after the
[38:47] things you wanted to Lust For and it
[38:48] didn't bother you one bit but see now
[38:51] that we are in a battle now that we have
[38:53] crossed Jordan and possessed the
[38:54] promised land that's when all those IES
[38:57] come out right that's when all those
[38:59] places that are that that we need to
[39:01] keep covered right we need to keep them
[39:04] cover because God said I will not you
[39:07] will not lose one man if you'll do what
[39:09] I tell you to do right right and when
[39:12] they didn't do what he told him to do
[39:13] they started losing men well Joshua real
[39:15] quick knew there was a
[39:17] problem he knew God had promised said
[39:20] hey you do this you do this and guess
[39:23] what's going to happen you'll not lose
[39:25] one man exactly not one
[39:29] man not one man amen in a war a battle
[39:32] that's unheard of cuz there was like
[39:35] 25,000 went out to battle the first time
[39:37] well in 25,000 you send 25,000 troops
[39:40] out somebody's going to die but God
[39:43] promised he said not one of you will
[39:45] die what a great thing we'll keep that
[39:48] in mind because we may use that in just
[39:49] a little while because you know what the
[39:52] people that are going to take a body
[39:53] change is going to have to take that
[39:54] same Revelation that same revelation of
[39:56] the body change is that you will not die
[39:59] exactly I don't care how many battles
[40:01] you fight I don't care how many wars as
[40:03] long as you do what you're supposed to
[40:05] do you will not die right cuz that's
[40:07] what he told him he said you'll not lose
[40:08] one man and then we know what happened
[40:11] with uh with a but we're not going into
[40:14] that right now now if you want to well
[40:16] go aad and turn to the book of numbers
[40:17] and we'll start in just a second but I
[40:20] want to excuse me tell you the reason
[40:23] that I asked that if I could do this
[40:24] tonight this afternoon was
[40:27] number one I I begin to think about this
[40:30] and I'm I was thinking about you know
[40:31] the promised land and I don't want when
[40:34] I get started with this I don't want
[40:35] anybody to think one thing's for
[40:38] sure that there's going to be some new
[40:41] somebody you know the what Keith said
[40:44] was you know the old Fighters died and
[40:46] this you know Hey listen they were lost
[40:47] eternally so let's don't talk about them
[40:50] exactly because you know what the Lord
[40:52] brought to my attention was when they
[40:55] crossed over in the Promised Land they
[40:56] were 20 and
[40:58] Below do you know when you cross over in
[41:01] the promised land that's what you are I
[41:03] don't care if you're 70 I don't care if
[41:05] you're 40 I don't care if you're 20
[41:07] right brother Brown said we'd be 18 to
[41:10] 20 years old yeah right so anything 20
[41:13] years old and Below that's that's going
[41:14] in the promised land so don't think that
[41:16] that I'm trying to say well those old
[41:18] Fighters you know brother Brown said
[41:19] those old Fighters but remember one
[41:21] thing they weren't born again right we
[41:24] got people that are sitting here that's
[41:26] been Fighters for a long time and they
[41:27] fult the faith and fult the gospel
[41:29] they're not the ones that's dying off
[41:31] this is a new generation when you're
[41:33] born again in this hour it's a new
[41:37] genation you've been reged I don't care
[41:40] if you're 70 40 20 or or 12 all right so
[41:43] don't think I'm talking about old people
[41:46] cuz you're more young than the than the
[41:47] younger people you're heading towards
[41:49] your youth we got this thing all
[41:51] backwards that's why I believe who was
[41:53] it said that we're supposed to cry at a
[41:55] birth and Rejoice at a funeral we do
[41:57] right the opposite we we cry at a
[42:00] funeral and rejoice when the baby's born
[42:02] we're not supposed to do that because
[42:04] we're getting closer but see what's
[42:06] going to happen is we got to change this
[42:08] guy right here we got to change this
[42:11] type of thinking that we've had uh one
[42:13] time I got you know he was a I think it
[42:16] was Zig Ziggler he said it's that
[42:17] stinking thinking that we've got that's
[42:19] what it is it's just when we get our own
[42:21] thoughts and our own ideas into
[42:23] something like we were talking about
[42:24] last night we get our own thoughts ideas
[42:26] into this and it becomes hatred malice
[42:30] emulation Strife what is Strife two
[42:33] people with two different ideas right
[42:36] it's not bad for me and brother dick to
[42:38] see different things different
[42:43] ways but see then if you start saying
[42:45] well brother Dick's wrong
[42:47] because or brother Wade's wrong
[42:50] because that's when you get into all
[42:52] those things of works of the flesh that
[42:54] we've been talking about in the the
[42:56] Sunday school I mean in the bible study
[42:58] which is very good because we do all
[42:59] have works of the flesh right we do all
[43:01] have Envy we do all have Strife we do
[43:03] all all those things but like we were
[43:05] saying before in James it says when lust
[43:08] is conceived brings forth Sin Sin when
[43:09] it's finished brings forth death right
[43:12] all right so if you let it keep going
[43:14] because the conception does what it
[43:15] plants the
[43:16] seed see it's not
[43:19] bad to have Envy it's not bad for me to
[43:21] be envious that somebody's driving a
[43:23] brand new car or we're
[43:25] suan
[43:27] Susan's driving my pickup truck so I'm
[43:30] envious of that but see I don't let it
[43:31] become so envious that I think all of
[43:34] her you know or think bad of her I told
[43:36] her the other day I said you know the
[43:38] Bible says that to not have ought
[43:40] against your brother but it didn't say
[43:42] nothing about your
[43:44] sister but that's just you're not
[43:46] supposed to do that I'm just telling you
[43:47] for a point don't don't do that but see
[43:49] there's things that we do as humans
[43:51] though in life that we shouldn't do like
[43:53] I just said resist the devil and he'll
[43:54] flee from you because we make these
[43:56] things and we roll them around in our
[43:58] brain and 99% of the time it's like the
[44:00] old saying is if brother Dick's talking
[44:02] to Sister Gail and she looks over at me
[44:04] and we're in a crowd but she looks over
[44:05] at me I immediately go well they're
[44:07] talking about me well no listen they got
[44:10] 100% more problems with their s than
[44:12] they got with me all right just for an
[44:15] example I
[44:18] guess I did that one time and somebody
[44:20] said me and my wife had a fight coming
[44:21] to church you didn't know that I said no
[44:23] I didn't know that I said but the Lord
[44:24] must have knew it he was there I wasn't
[44:27] but listen to get started the reason I
[44:30] was looking at this and seeing and I was
[44:32] going to give you a little experience
[44:33] that I had in Oklahoma is that I was
[44:36] ministering there the last time and and
[44:39] you know I don't I'm not what you say a
[44:41] very spiritual kind of guy you know but
[44:43] there are sometimes when God will drop
[44:44] down and say something to you believe
[44:46] and you listen amen cuz remember the
[44:49] first time remember they remember June
[44:51] and I had went on a cruise and we had
[44:53] went um to Seattle and we were were
[44:56] getting ready to fly back home and the
[44:58] night before you know I told you some of
[45:00] the story but the Lord just well I
[45:02] didn't know it was the Lord then I it's
[45:03] just an impression that you get that
[45:05] that the engine's going to catch on fire
[45:08] of the plane right just as plain as if
[45:10] dick said just what he said right just
[45:12] something just came and I didn't say
[45:13] nothing to June cuz I didn't want to
[45:15] worri but it put you in a position of
[45:18] desperation right to begin praying in
[45:22] Earnest cuz you don't want to get up in
[45:24] the sky and airplane and the engine
[45:27] catch on fire but that became so real to
[45:29] me that I believed that that's what was
[45:30] going to happen so I prayed and you know
[45:33] for those of you that don't know the
[45:34] story make a long story short we get on
[45:36] the the Jet and we're sitting there you
[45:38] know we're everybody's already loaded on
[45:39] the plane we're getting ready to leave
[45:41] and I thought well Lord you got to do
[45:43] something now cuz I want him to find it
[45:46] now I don't want him to find it up there
[45:48] right all right so I one but about 10
[45:50] minutes before we were getting ready to
[45:52] take off I look out and look out and I
[45:54] see all these people come running toward
[45:56] the wing of the
[45:58] plane well there was a huge gas
[46:01] leak in that engine of that plane and if
[46:05] they would have fired that engine
[46:07] up it would have caught on fire so so
[46:11] they got us off the plane well thank God
[46:13] for that God didn't tell me he was going
[46:15] to do that he just said that the engine
[46:16] was going to catch on fire he wanted me
[46:17] to
[46:19] pray all right well then it happened
[46:21] just the other day we were coming back
[46:23] from uh Oklahoma and and I was tell I'll
[46:26] tell you the experience of that in a
[46:27] minute but we were coming back from
[46:28] Oklahoma the night before June thought I
[46:31] was mad at her cuz usually when when I
[46:34] get to meditate and I don't say
[46:35] anything and uh same voice just come
[46:39] straight down and said there's going to
[46:42] be a flat tire but it's just something
[46:43] it's it's an impression it's not
[46:45] something that you know just there's
[46:47] going to be a flat tire well she didn't
[46:48] know it but every time we stopped cuz
[46:50] it's 2 and 1/2 hours from Bartlesville
[46:52] to witch car to get on the airplane and
[46:54] we were running kind of late anyway so
[46:56] I'd go around I was kicking the tires on
[46:58] every time we stopped get gas I was
[46:59] going around kicking I said Lord there
[47:01] going to be cuz it was that same
[47:03] impression and so I knew it was going to
[47:04] happen right well see I prayed in
[47:06] Earnest but when I got when we got ready
[47:09] to to go everything was fine we flew
[47:11] back into Atlanta and flew in and we get
[47:15] a phone
[47:16] call and it's Hannah she said I've had a
[47:20] flat
[47:22] tire on the interstate right but it
[47:25] wasn't so flat actually a policeman
[47:27] drove by and pointed down to a tire the
[47:30] front tire was almost flat so she had to
[47:32] pull off on the side of the road which
[47:33] she was running probably 60 or 70 M an
[47:35] hour and so she was warned of that or it
[47:38] would have burst so see here you go
[47:40] praying in Earnest and you to start
[47:41] praying well see don't things like that
[47:44] happen well the other day I had an
[47:45] experience in Oklahoma that I had
[47:48] finished ministering and and you know
[47:50] the the Lord was really come down in in
[47:52] prayer with the people and it was just
[47:54] the same group of people same normal
[47:56] group as it is but I'm getting to a
[47:58] story
[47:59] here but when I finished and brother
[48:02] claw took over in the Pulpit I just felt
[48:04] like just like you know you you when
[48:06] you're preaching you get kind of fired
[48:08] up you know you get a little bit you
[48:09] like Brother Dean said you know he was
[48:10] feeling bad until he got the pull pad
[48:12] and you do that you there's an anointing
[48:13] comes on you and it doesn't matter if
[48:14] you have a headache or whatever anything
[48:16] happens when you're up here and you feel
[48:18] the anointing of the people which is you
[48:20] pulling on the gift then you feel you
[48:22] feel you know you feel good right well
[48:25] baby when I see down well I didn't sit
[48:26] down I I went over and stood like I
[48:28] usually do and it was just like somebody
[48:31] had just took a a valve and just pulled
[48:34] all the energy out of my body if you've
[48:37] never had that happen before you're in
[48:38] for a treat amen but what happens is
[48:41] it's the virtue right it's strength just
[48:43] and I just I fell out I sat down and CLA
[48:46] looked over and he he didn't say
[48:48] anything but you know he then he started
[48:50] worshiping the people started worshiping
[48:51] and we had a real good time and I told
[48:54] him afterwards I said man I said I
[48:55] couldn't stand up that's right I said I
[48:57] couldn't stand up and I told them while
[48:58] they was there you know uh they got
[49:00] finished singing and I said can I say
[49:02] something I said whatever you need at
[49:04] this
[49:05] time you pray for it right now cuz God's
[49:08] here doing something I don't know what
[49:10] he's doing I mean he he don't have to
[49:12] write down on a tablet and tell you what
[49:14] he's going to do you know why cuz it's
[49:16] child training he's training me and you
[49:18] to when he
[49:20] speaks you know it's him amen and you
[49:23] better start doing something about it I
[49:25] mean he could told me he said well
[49:26] you're not going to have a tire flat
[49:28] your daughter is no he didn't he wanted
[49:30] me to pray and I was praying the whole
[49:32] time cuz you said I thought you were mad
[49:35] at me cuz by the time we flew into
[49:37] Atlanta I had forgot about the tire and
[49:39] then she's on the phone she said Hannah
[49:41] just had a
[49:43] flat and I just turned around and
[49:45] started crying I said God I said I know
[49:47] what it was for then I said it was you
[49:49] want me to pray because you knew that
[49:52] tiwer was going to go flat I didn't same
[49:54] way with the airplan
[49:56] but during that time I thought in myself
[50:01] that that the people there were of
[50:03] course we you know we're real close to
[50:05] each other and almost like we are here
[50:07] uh just a family but someone was pulling
[50:10] strength out of out of you know not me
[50:12] as a person but but what was being said
[50:14] what was being ministered and you know
[50:16] and Claude even even um said that that
[50:19] was the best he had heard in a long time
[50:21] you know of of what we've been
[50:22] ministering out there and it was more of
[50:25] a for the people amen and I come back
[50:29] and and I thought I thought
[50:32] Lord I need to do something because I'm
[50:35] stuck we all get in those places you
[50:37] know that where you just sitting there
[50:39] spinning your wheels we get stuck in a
[50:41] place and and you know just to give you
[50:44] a little bit of background uh the work
[50:47] that I had done was was a very stressful
[50:50] job it was a it was a job where you had
[50:53] to do a lot of you had to lie just be
[50:55] let me just be honest you were told to
[50:57] do things that were dishonest that you
[50:59] were not supposed to do and being put in
[51:01] a job as a as a plant manager there's a
[51:03] lot of stress and a lot of hours
[51:05] involved and I had forgot about you guys
[51:08] I had forgot about God really because
[51:12] that was on my mind 24 hours a day 7
[51:14] days a week it was something that I
[51:16] thought about continually and that was
[51:18] job this job that job this job that so I
[51:22] was sit and praying you know a several
[51:24] weeks ago
[51:26] and you know you sometimes you you just
[51:28] have to do what God says just like on
[51:31] those things about praying well that
[51:33] same voice that that had come the other
[51:36] two times come a third time and said
[51:38] we'll call your
[51:39] brother they call your
[51:41] brother cuz I've been praying I said
[51:43] Lord I need out of this because I'm
[51:44] dying spiritually and I don't want to
[51:46] die spiritually I don't mind work but
[51:49] when you get that thing work stuck in
[51:50] your head let me tell you something
[51:52] people physical stress
[51:56] won't kill you mental stress will kill
[51:59] you you will not get away from mental
[52:01] physical stress you can just take a day
[52:03] off for Saturday stay in bed till 8:30
[52:05] 9:00 and you're you know you're
[52:06] rejuvenated you you just have to you
[52:08] know you just have to pace yourself but
[52:10] mental stress will kill you right cuz
[52:14] you can't get rid of it there's no way
[52:15] of working it off right all right and so
[52:19] all that came about and I was sitting
[52:21] there thinking on what to do something
[52:22] to do and and praying about it and and
[52:25] that same voice came and said we'll call
[52:27] your brother see what he's got so anyway
[52:30] make a long story short I'm working for
[52:32] him now and and the stress level went
[52:34] from 100 to
[52:36] zero Bless but I I went and talked to
[52:39] Dad about it and you know I had been
[52:42] more I had been wanting to do more with
[52:45] with with you yeah and that's what the
[52:48] impression came to me from Oklahoma was
[52:50] that the people was drawing strength
[52:51] from from what I had to say from a gift
[52:53] that that God give me that that I've
[52:56] used in the wrong way for many years
[52:59] that I want to use in the right way and
[53:00] I haven't been doing it in the past
[53:01] several years because of that part of
[53:04] the work that I was doing but I thought
[53:07] Lord I want to do
[53:09] something more to help you yeah because
[53:14] we all need help and you know when Keith
[53:16] come last weekend and he started talking
[53:17] about the family I thought well God
[53:19] that's a there was a couple other things
[53:20] that I prayed about that was a
[53:21] confirmation that you know sometimes we
[53:24] we want to we want to be just like step
[53:27] out on faith and boy have that big
[53:28] strong faith but you like to have a
[53:30] little bit of a little no every once in
[53:33] a while that God is with you and and and
[53:37] we got that and in in what we're doing
[53:40] but I want to I want to do more with
[53:43] with you as a
[53:44] church because you know what Joshua and
[53:47] Caleb this is what all came to me Joshua
[53:49] and Caleb that 20y old group and Below
[53:53] they were raised under more I believe
[53:55] this now the Bible didn't say this but
[53:57] this is just what I believe they were
[53:58] raised under that Joshua and Caleb
[54:01] mentality right don't you think
[54:04] that they were under that Joshua and
[54:07] Caleb mentality but what they was when
[54:09] they got there to CTI barnea some of
[54:11] them weren't even born cuz it was 40
[54:13] years in the wilderness right some of
[54:15] them were 20 and below so they were they
[54:16] were born in the way that's what I was
[54:18] saying about the way yeah we get in the
[54:20] way a lot of times right that's what
[54:22] happened to those people over there they
[54:24] got in the way those two million people
[54:25] got in the way of Joshua and Caleb
[54:28] because Joshua and Caleb said we're more
[54:29] than able to take that ramp amen that's
[54:31] right and I believe if they let Joshua
[54:33] and Caleb go brother de they would have
[54:34] went and took the land cuz God had done
[54:36] said he said they'll not nobody stand in
[54:38] front of you glory
[54:40] nobody
[54:42] nobody where's Satan in this nobody
[54:46] exactly nobody will stand in front of
[54:48] you nobody will stand in front of us if
[54:51] we'll just believe so I got to think
[54:52] about Joshua and Caleb and that men
[54:55] mentality that they had been brought up
[54:56] under they didn't see the signs yeah
[55:00] they didn't see the Wonders but now they
[55:02] did eat the Mana amen cuz the Mana
[55:04] didn't cease till they got in the
[55:05] promised land exactly right so they ate
[55:08] the Mana right they saw that their
[55:11] clothes grew with them amen but Joshua
[55:14] and Caleb I believe was sitting there
[55:16] every day we going to take this place
[55:19] we're going to a new land we're going to
[55:21] possess this land we're going to go to a
[55:23] spot that you've never seen before but
[55:26] believe me we've seen it right Joshua is
[55:28] the type of the Holy Ghost and Caleb's
[55:30] the type of the end time believer right
[55:31] amen well that's those those little 20
[55:34] and Below must have fit in that Caleb
[55:36] Spot somewhere right cuz Joshua and
[55:38] Caleb was the one that was telling them
[55:40] even Moses was there right and we'll
[55:43] read it in just a minute that Joshua and
[55:47] Caleb lived with that group of people
[55:51] amen that's right I believe Brother D I
[55:54] believe they live with that group of
[55:56] people and train them cuz you know
[56:00] what the Lord told Joshua said as I was
[56:04] with Moses now what did Moses do Moses
[56:06] trained Joshua Joshua was there the
[56:08] whole time right exactly Joshua was
[56:11] right there with Moses the whole time
[56:14] amen so even though Moses went off the
[56:16] scene Moses was standing there in Joshua
[56:20] absolutely okay then now what is Joshua
[56:23] going to do he's got to take that what
[56:25] he's got and give it to this new
[56:28] generation right that's coming up if
[56:31] we've been here 40 years then we need to
[56:33] do something about getting into this new
[56:35] genation
[56:38] right so believe me or
[56:42] not like me or not you're stuck with
[56:47] me I told that I was going to start
[56:50] doing more with each one of you if you
[56:52] have any problems you can come talk to
[56:53] me he's still the pastor don't ever
[56:55] forget that I'm not taking nobody's
[56:57] place but I do want to help right I do
[57:00] want to help okay any any of you we're
[57:04] going to maybe go visit and do things
[57:06] Jun and I be able to visit more maybe
[57:08] with you and do some more things with
[57:09] you and I want to go after the ones that
[57:11] are not in here yeah the
[57:15] Lord I believe Joshua and Caleb went
[57:18] after that group of 20 and
[57:21] below and they focused on that group of
[57:23] people amen and they went after them and
[57:26] you know what none of the old ones made
[57:29] it but the Bible says all that were 20
[57:33] and under went in that Promised Land all
[57:36] of them all of our people we got we got
[57:39] empty seats where brother Robbie and
[57:42] sister
[57:43] Ruth all your children I want to have I
[57:46] want to I I I don't need your
[57:49] blessing to go talk to them but I would
[57:52] like to have some support amen as I do
[57:55] go talk to
[57:56] them okay um Richard H some of those
[58:00] others some of those people that are out
[58:01] there just floundering around in a world
[58:03] right uh I got a good chance to talk
[58:05] with Jeff's with me and and and Amy
[58:08] they're not in church all the time I
[58:10] want to be able to talk to them some
[58:11] more cuz Jeffrey will be with me most of
[58:13] the time while we're working and had a
[58:15] good chance to talk to brother Timothy
[58:17] and and even Lisa's brother was
[58:19] interested in some he heard an hour
[58:21] sermon he's going to have to sit in the
[58:22] car with me so he listened to everything
[58:24] I said you know I used him for an
[58:25] example cuz he was chewing Tob Backa and
[58:27] I used to do that so I kind of used him
[58:29] as an example and and Timbo was sitting
[58:31] in the back you know so you got a
[58:33] captive audience right they can't
[58:34] they're not going to get out 70 mph in M
[58:38] Atlanta
[58:40] so
[58:44] yeah but I want to be more involved
[58:46] because I want it's like I was saying in
[58:48] Oklahoma there was some there was some
[58:50] things and and I know I got a gift I got
[58:51] a gift to
[58:53] yaking but also that that the Lord has
[58:56] given me an ability to teach where I can
[58:58] break things down and and you say well
[59:00] well you're boasting no I'm like I was
[59:02] praying right in Israel just like gersan
[59:06] Solomon and them said said I can't help
[59:08] it in what God made me but I'm going to
[59:10] take what God made me and I'm going to
[59:11] use it now that's what the Jews they may
[59:13] be arrogant cuz they not born again I
[59:16] don't want to be arrogant cuz I believe
[59:18] I'm a born again Christian it's not
[59:19] going to make me arrogant right but I do
[59:22] know that God give us a gift amen and he
[59:24] told us that if we get in our
[59:27] position ain't that what we're waiting
[59:29] on somebody to stand up and say hey I'm
[59:32] I'm a deacon I know I'm an elder I know
[59:36] I have the gift of wisdom I know I have
[59:38] the gift of faith I know I have these
[59:40] other gifts all the way down all nine
[59:43] spiritual gifts you got to realize
[59:45] that's what you're looking at amen you
[59:47] got to realize that I told him I going
[59:48] to do
[59:49] this
[59:53] hey but everybody I'm telling you
[59:57] everybody him included I want us all to
[59:59] make it amen and I'm going to do
[1:00:02] everything I can right to see that we do
[1:00:05] make it cuz Joshua and what Caleb tell
[1:00:08] him he said give me my Mountain amen he
[1:00:12] said I am no
[1:00:14] more I am no more weak than when me and
[1:00:18] Moses talked about this 40 years ago I
[1:00:20] am no more weak today than I was
[1:00:23] then that was 40
[1:00:25] years he was 80 years
[1:00:28] old
[1:00:32] man but you know what he got he got the
[1:00:35] mountain exactly he got the possession
[1:00:38] that God had given that's what I want to
[1:00:40] say go in and possess the land that's
[1:00:44] right now look let me read you something
[1:00:47] turn to turn to numbers
[1:00:53] 14
[1:01:03] verse
[1:01:05] 29 and I hope I'm all right with this I
[1:01:08] am not wanting to get in your
[1:01:11] face and make you a Christian right that
[1:01:14] don't
[1:01:15] work I don't want to build church
[1:01:18] members that's right I do not want to
[1:01:20] fill this church up with people right
[1:01:22] amen I want to fill this church up with
[1:01:24] Christian amen and the ones of you
[1:01:27] that's been here for a while I want you
[1:01:28] to be a Christian that's what I was
[1:01:29] telling I was telling Timbo I said
[1:01:31] brother Tim I said he said well I don't
[1:01:33] know if I'm born again or not I said you
[1:01:34] know what I said sometimes I feel the
[1:01:37] same
[1:01:38] way but they somewhere you got to put a
[1:01:41] state down and say God like that brother
[1:01:43] said you going to find a bag of bones
[1:01:45] right here until you do something for me
[1:01:47] I'm going to stay right here this is
[1:01:49] where I'm going to put a state down and
[1:01:51] he made a good statement he said you
[1:01:53] know he said I'm going work in progress
[1:01:55] I said brother Tim we're all to work in
[1:01:57] progress I said but I want to see us to
[1:02:00] where this is this is what I want to see
[1:02:01] and I don't like I said I want to get in
[1:02:03] your face but I don't want to see when
[1:02:04] we start take communion this afternoon
[1:02:05] that half of you walk out that back
[1:02:07] door or half of you take communion and
[1:02:10] don't do the foot washing yeah come on
[1:02:13] people that's right the Bible didn't say
[1:02:15] do half of it right the Bible said do
[1:02:17] all of it so either do it all or don't
[1:02:20] do any of it if you're still smoking
[1:02:23] drinking running around wearing earrings
[1:02:26] and all this junk don't take communion
[1:02:28] today cuz you're not
[1:02:31] worthy we have open communion for
[1:02:33] anybody that wants it right but the
[1:02:35] Bible said that you are condemning your
[1:02:37] own body amen you will
[1:02:40] die
[1:02:42] right
[1:02:44] remember even when they brought the ark
[1:02:48] back they brought it back in a wrong way
[1:02:51] cuz it was on a cart right but what
[1:02:54] happened a good
[1:02:56] man that had good intentions come on now
[1:03:00] he had good intentions he didn't want
[1:03:02] that Ark to hit the ground but when he
[1:03:04] touched that Ark he was not worthy to
[1:03:06] touch that Ark and what did he do God
[1:03:08] killed him right so we got good
[1:03:11] intentions but like old saying is the
[1:03:13] road to Hell's paid with good intentions
[1:03:15] we got to be
[1:03:16] Christians we got to be born again
[1:03:18] Believers cuz when Joshua went in that
[1:03:21] land he didn't take halfway Believers
[1:03:23] with him right cuz we're going to find
[1:03:25] out something happened that they must
[1:03:26] have believe Joshua so much till he let
[1:03:29] them circumcise every one of them at 20
[1:03:32] years old that's right he circumcised
[1:03:34] them they didn't do it theirself and the
[1:03:36] doctor didn't do it Joshua did
[1:03:38] it then they went in took the land let's
[1:03:42] read verse 29 your carcass shall fall in
[1:03:44] this Wilderness and all that were
[1:03:46] numbered of you according to your whole
[1:03:48] number from 20 years old and upward
[1:03:50] which have murmured against
[1:03:53] me doubtless you shall not come into the
[1:03:56] land concerning which I swear to make
[1:03:58] you dwell therein save Caleb the son of
[1:04:02] jeffan and Joshua the son of none but
[1:04:05] your little ones and I wrote in my Bible
[1:04:07] that's me which you said should be a
[1:04:10] prey them will I bring in and they shall
[1:04:13] know the land which you have despised
[1:04:17] right but as for you your carcass they
[1:04:20] shall fall in this Wilderness and your
[1:04:21] children shall wander in the wilderness
[1:04:23] 40 years and bear your boredom until
[1:04:24] your carcasses be
[1:04:26] wasted in the wilderness we not read on
[1:04:29] because don't worry about
[1:04:31] that I don't think like I said everybody
[1:04:33] said boy you start talking about a new
[1:04:35] generation coming up then you got old
[1:04:37] people you know you got dad and you got
[1:04:39] dick you got all brother collie and all
[1:04:40] these gray-headed people brother how you
[1:04:43] think boy they're just going to rot in
[1:04:44] the will no when you become born again
[1:04:47] you become a 20-y old just like that
[1:04:49] exactly exactly when you become born
[1:04:51] again you're 20 years old that's like
[1:04:52] dad's been preaching
[1:04:55] you're redeemed sitting in Heavenly
[1:04:57] places that soul is is 20 years old
[1:05:01] exactly right ain't that what the
[1:05:02] prophet said amen so don't talk about
[1:05:04] these old people well they're got all
[1:05:06] die off well they might but you know
[1:05:08] what they're closer to being young than
[1:05:09] we are amen right
[1:05:12] but we're all the same age Glory when
[1:05:16] God looks at us so when Joshua looked at
[1:05:19] that group of people he saw that 20 and
[1:05:20] Below he said hey this is the group I've
[1:05:23] been looking for right here amen cuz
[1:05:25] remember the Bible says Josh that God
[1:05:27] raised up a new
[1:05:29] generation that didn't know all that old
[1:05:31] junk that had been going on all that old
[1:05:33] two Lords and seven Thunders and all
[1:05:35] that stuff that's what I'm telling you
[1:05:36] people you and I in this building
[1:05:39] today better realize one thing we're
[1:05:42] either going to go in or we're going to
[1:05:44] die like those people did cuz we know
[1:05:47] too much we've got too much going on
[1:05:49] here that we can't say well we're
[1:05:51] ignorant of these things we're not
[1:05:53] ignorant
[1:05:55] we're either with the Joshua and Caleb
[1:05:57] group or we're with that group that
[1:05:59] Jesus said they're all
[1:06:01] dead cuz you and I don't have there's
[1:06:03] not a gray area exactly you're not
[1:06:06] almost pregnant no you're either
[1:06:08] pregnated or you're not pregnated and
[1:06:11] like I told him this morning and they
[1:06:12] are and they are fruits to show that
[1:06:15] each one that's the way we should be all
[1:06:19] right but I want to do one
[1:06:23] thing
[1:06:24] brother R said I didn't come to build a
[1:06:26] church he said I come to build
[1:06:27] individual right I want us all to grow
[1:06:29] as individuals right cuz some are not
[1:06:31] going to be you can't say well now
[1:06:33] brother Gary you got to be no you ain't
[1:06:35] got to be it's like brother Keith said
[1:06:38] and I really enjoyed what he said he
[1:06:39] said now I was telling him in Sunday
[1:06:41] school not doing away with the fivefold
[1:06:43] ministry we know that the only way to
[1:06:45] get perfected is by can everybody say
[1:06:47] Amen we don't take the Bible away but
[1:06:50] there is a time where that need the
[1:06:51] Bible says no man need teach you why
[1:06:53] because what you hear from here right
[1:06:56] that inside teacher is going to tell you
[1:06:58] yes it's right or no it's or no it's
[1:06:59] wrong all right so it's between you and
[1:07:01] God you are the ones that you when this
[1:07:04] thing when this thing disperses and we
[1:07:06] can't meet like this anymore guess who
[1:07:08] it's going to be it's going to be you
[1:07:09] and God it's going to be you and God but
[1:07:12] you know what it's going to be what you
[1:07:13] built
[1:07:14] on while you were here and I'm not
[1:07:16] saying here as far as here this this
[1:07:18] physical but here in this message right
[1:07:21] that's what's going to take you in cuz
[1:07:23] Joshua and K I don't think they sat down
[1:07:25] individually maybe with each one but
[1:07:27] they took him as a group and said look
[1:07:28] here's the promised land right right
[1:07:30] it's a land flowing with milk and honey
[1:07:33] we saw it with our eyes we'll read it in
[1:07:36] just a
[1:07:37] minute Joshua said you hadn't been this
[1:07:39] way before so kind of stand back a
[1:07:41] little bit but who did he send first the
[1:07:44] priest he sent the priest first amen
[1:07:47] then when the priest got in Jordan roll
[1:07:49] back the waters then the people walked
[1:07:51] away all right but now the priest had
[1:07:53] not physically been there before but
[1:07:55] they must knew something they must have
[1:07:57] caught the vision of a message that
[1:07:59] Joshua and Caleb preached sometimes I
[1:08:02] think what we do is we take Joshua and
[1:08:04] Caleb and say well they were Mighty
[1:08:05] people but they were just
[1:08:06] men my it's an example for your whole
[1:08:09] journey it's an example for everything
[1:08:12] plus by the time we get in the promised
[1:08:14] land we still got all these IES that we
[1:08:16] got to fight the war didn't start till
[1:08:19] last till they Cross Jordan exactly all
[1:08:21] right but but God say if you'll do all
[1:08:24] these things right no man will stand in
[1:08:27] front of
[1:08:28] you all right now let's turn to Joshua 1
[1:08:33] cuz that's when they really started to
[1:08:35] focus
[1:08:39] in on the
[1:08:41] journey everybody all right say Amen
[1:08:45] am I want to help you people I've always
[1:08:48] wanted to help people right and I want
[1:08:50] to help you I don't want to ever hurt
[1:08:53] you and I know I've hurt hurt feelings
[1:08:54] Maybe by sometimes by the things I say
[1:08:57] but just God help me to clam it shut all
[1:09:00] right cuz I want to help you Gina I want
[1:09:04] to help you all I do sometimes maybe in
[1:09:07] in U joking like we were talking about
[1:09:10] last night you know brother brand said
[1:09:11] you shouldn't joke well he wasn't
[1:09:13] talking about cuz they said he told
[1:09:14] jokes all the time but if you if you if
[1:09:16] a joke was if a joke between two people
[1:09:18] hurts a third person that's not a joke
[1:09:20] that's right you understand what I'm
[1:09:22] saying you joke around make somebody
[1:09:24] feel lower right you're not helping
[1:09:26] anything so best thing to do just shut
[1:09:28] up you know best thing to do just be
[1:09:30] quiet all right so in Joshua
[1:09:33] 1 we see this man do we believe that
[1:09:36] Joshua now Joshua the man is physically
[1:09:39] dead now right now right but if he types
[1:09:43] the Holy Spirit then he's still alive
[1:09:45] amen amen and whatever we need to go
[1:09:48] into this land the Holy Ghost has
[1:09:49] already been there and he's trying to
[1:09:52] get us to go there right all right and
[1:09:55] then what he's going to do though people
[1:09:57] we can't stop there we we we say so much
[1:09:59] about getting into the land but when we
[1:10:01] get in that land there still work to do
[1:10:04] amen but there is a promise and I want
[1:10:05] to read you the promise in just a little
[1:10:07] while but in Joshua 1 now after the
[1:10:08] death of Moses the servant of the
[1:10:10] Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake
[1:10:13] unto Joshua the son of nun Moses
[1:10:14] Minister saying Moses is
[1:10:17] Minister

[1:10:37] you as I said unto Moses from the
[1:10:38] Wilderness un this Lebanon even into the
[1:10:41] Great River the river Euphrates all the
[1:10:42] land of the Hittites and to the great
[1:10:44] sea toward the going down of the sun

[1:10:48] man be able to stand before thee all the
[1:10:52] days of th thy
[1:10:58] life let that sink

[1:11:26] people the old ones that he was talking
[1:11:28] about you know that's going to die
[1:11:29] they're gone and this right here they're
[1:11:31] gone he's talking to that one group of
[1:11:34] people that raised up under his ministry
[1:11:37] all
[1:11:39] right be strong and of good courage unto
[1:11:42] this people shalt thou divide for an
[1:11:44] inheritance this land which I swear unto
[1:11:46] their fathers to give unto thee unto
[1:11:49] them only be thou strong and very
[1:11:50] courageous that thou mayest observe to
[1:11:52] do according to all the law which Moses
[1:11:54] my servant commanded theee turn not from
[1:11:57] it to the right hand or to the left that
[1:12:00] thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou
[1:12:04] goest all right let's go to verse n have
[1:12:07] not I commanded thee be strong and of
[1:12:09] good courage he's told him this three
[1:12:10] times Be not Afraid neither be thou
[1:12:12] dismayed for the Lord thy God is with
[1:12:14] thee whether soever thou goest if you're
[1:12:17] born again that's exactly what happened
[1:12:19] whether soever thou goest God is with
[1:12:22] you Glory then Jesus commanded the off
[1:12:26] then Jesus well same thing then Joshua
[1:12:29] commanded the officers of the people
[1:12:30] saying pass through the host and command
[1:12:33] the people saying prepare you victuals
[1:12:36] for within 3 days you shall pass over
[1:12:38] this Jordan what are we in now we're in
[1:12:41] our our 2,000 years is gone we're in our
[1:12:44] third day right you shall pass over this
[1:12:48] Jordan now what is Jordan type of death
[1:12:52] right if you're going to type everything
[1:12:54] you might as well go and type Jordan to
[1:12:56] go in to possess the L which the Lord
[1:12:59] your God giveth you to possess it and to
[1:13:02] the reubenites and gadites to half the
[1:13:04] tribe of Manasseh spake Joshua saying
[1:13:06] remember the words of Moses now we know
[1:13:08] that was a type of the church ages with
[1:13:11] Luther and Wesley and a half tribe of
[1:13:12] Pentecost you can read that in the
[1:13:14] message save time but there was two
[1:13:16] tribes and a half that stayed on this
[1:13:18] side and the they went over though see
[1:13:22] that's where people they say well Luther
[1:13:23] and Wesley didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:13:24] cuz they didn't go over into the
[1:13:26] promised land read your Bible right they
[1:13:28] went over in the promised land helped
[1:13:30] them fight and then come back out and
[1:13:32] got their land all right because
[1:13:33] remember Luther and Wesley couldn't get
[1:13:35] all the way out of their denominational
[1:13:36] ideas everybody understand that amen the
[1:13:40] two tribes and the half tribe they tped
[1:13:42] Luther and Wesley went over the land and
[1:13:44] helped them fight cuz this what Joshua
[1:13:45] said I want you to go over there and
[1:13:46] help them fight but when we possess that
[1:13:48] land you can go back and get your land
[1:13:50] on this side this side Jordan all right
[1:13:52] cuz they they had the new birth for
[1:13:54] their age but they didn't couldn't get
[1:13:55] all the way out they couldn't they
[1:13:56] couldn't go into that see this promised
[1:13:58] land is more than we just say well it's
[1:14:00] the Ty of the new birth it is the type
[1:14:01] of New Birth but it's the type of the
[1:14:03] end time believer amen Caleb was the
[1:14:05] type of the end time
[1:14:07] believer not the first age believer the
[1:14:10] second a the brother said the end time
[1:14:13] believer so Caleb is you and I the end
[1:14:16] time believer all
[1:14:17] right and these two tribes in a half
[1:14:20] they went over to fight and then they
[1:14:21] come back all right then we'll take skip
[1:14:24] chapter 2 we know that's Rahab but go to
[1:14:26] chapter 3 and then we'll finish right
[1:14:29] here you love the Lord I love him now
[1:14:33] you say well you love him more than now
[1:14:34] I love him more than ever cuz you know
[1:14:35] what he's sent me

[1:17:43] and little you in this thing none none
[1:17:47] chapter
[1:17:48] 3 and Joshua Rose early in the morning
[1:17:51] and they were moved from sham and came
[1:17:52] to Jordan and he and all the children of
[1:17:54] Israel and lodged there before they
[1:17:56] passed over now remember brother Dale
[1:17:59] talked about this morning if you read on
[1:18:01] down through the book of Romans we talk
[1:18:02] about a place that we wait for something
[1:18:05] yeah all right these people come to a
[1:18:07] place and that was that was the reason
[1:18:10] that they possessed the land they went
[1:18:13] by what God told them Joshua told them
[1:18:15] to do right now see the problem is
[1:18:17] here's here's the here's here's the
[1:18:19] people in the message they come up to
[1:18:21] Jordan and he Joshua is their leader and
[1:18:24] they come up and they don't want to
[1:18:25] Lodge they want to go over
[1:18:27] now yeah let's go now let's go do
[1:18:30] something you remember when the children
[1:18:32] of Israel said said you know let Moses
[1:18:35] speak and all that remember at the
[1:18:36] mountain all this how all this came
[1:18:39] about and then the very next day or two
[1:18:41] they said oh we can go we'll go possess
[1:18:43] it now remember what they done they went
[1:18:45] out of the will of God they went up on
[1:18:47] that mountain and the amorites killed
[1:18:48] them a bunch of them and they had to
[1:18:49] come back down why because God didn't
[1:18:51] tell them to go up at then he told them
[1:18:53] to go 2 days before and they didn't want
[1:18:55] to go right same way with you and I
[1:18:57] there's a time and a place for all
[1:18:59] things and we must be able to do just
[1:19:01] like this they lodged there before they
[1:19:03] passed over they had to wait till the
[1:19:06] right time to go over Jordan they didn't
[1:19:09] you know like I said I just see people
[1:19:11] today they say well they see the Jordan
[1:19:13] and they see the promised land well they
[1:19:14] just you know mule blinders and just
[1:19:16] take out that's why you have so many
[1:19:18] false doctrines that's why you have so
[1:19:19] many ideas that's why you have so many
[1:19:21] divisions it's because people want to go
[1:19:23] out ahead of the program even the
[1:19:25] prophet of God said that he said you see
[1:19:27] these scrap heaps of ministers laying on
[1:19:28] the side of the road tried to go out
[1:19:30] ahead of somebody and they fell off
[1:19:32] right same way with you and I and it
[1:19:33] came to pass after 3 days that the
[1:19:36] officers went through the host and they
[1:19:37] commanded the people saying when you see
[1:19:39] the Ark of the
[1:19:41] Covenant now what was in that Ark of the
[1:19:43] Covenant the two tables of stone brother
[1:19:45] B said The
[1:19:46] Headstone so we're not talking about
[1:19:48] some just little we're not talking about
[1:19:50] this baby form being born again now
[1:19:52] we're talking about The Headstone being
[1:19:53] with us we're talking about the Ark of
[1:19:55] the
[1:19:56] Covenant the two tables of stone fit
[1:19:58] inside that Ark and they had possession
[1:20:01] of
[1:20:02] that they had possession of that
[1:20:05] Ark so do you and I right and it came to
[1:20:09] pass after three days officers went
[1:20:10] through the host and they commanded the
[1:20:12] people saying when you see the Ark of
[1:20:14] the Covenant of the Lord your God and
[1:20:15] the priests the Levites bearing it see
[1:20:18] that's what happened they were supposed
[1:20:20] to Bear it the preachers were supposed
[1:20:21] to Bear the word not an ox cart or
[1:20:24] anything else cuz that's what got them
[1:20:25] in trouble with David that thing got
[1:20:27] ready to fall off if they if the priest
[1:20:28] would have been carrying it they would
[1:20:30] not have a problem all
[1:20:32] right then you shall remove from your
[1:20:34] place and go after it so the ministry
[1:20:38] goes before right that's what it's
[1:20:41] saying right the priests are going to
[1:20:42] Bear the ark they're going to go before
[1:20:44] with the word of God cuz they're first
[1:20:46] partakers right yet there shall be a
[1:20:49] space between you and it right about
[1:20:53] 2,000 cubits by measure come not near
[1:20:55] unto it that you may know the way by
[1:20:57] which you must go for you have not
[1:21:00] passed this way here to for right and
[1:21:02] Joshua said unto the people sanctify
[1:21:04] yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do
[1:21:07] wonders among you and Joshua spake un
[1:21:10] the priest saying take up the Ark of the
[1:21:11] Covenant and pass it over before the
[1:21:14] people in other words they put it in
[1:21:16] front of the people
[1:21:18] first that's what we're doing right now
[1:21:20] right right that's what we're doing
[1:21:21] right now the Ark of the Covenant is
[1:21:24] with us and we're passing it before the
[1:21:27] people and the Lord said unto Joshua
[1:21:30] this day will I begin to magnify the in
[1:21:32] the sight of all Israel that they may
[1:21:34] know that as I was with Moses so I will
[1:21:37] be with you and thou shalt command the
[1:21:41] priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant
[1:21:42] now who is this Joshua type of the Holy
[1:21:44] Ghost he's commanding the priest to do
[1:21:46] something
[1:21:48] amen you say well I'm not going to take
[1:21:50] orders from nobody well well you just
[1:21:53] lost the gift that God gave you right
[1:21:56] cuz God give you a gift and he tells you
[1:21:58] to do something you need to do it amen
[1:22:00] cuz Thou shalt command the priest that
[1:22:02] bear the Ark of the Covenant saying when
[1:22:04] ye are come to the brink of the water of
[1:22:06] Jordan you shall stand
[1:22:09] still in
[1:22:12] Jordan we waited a few minutes ago now
[1:22:15] we're standing
[1:22:17] still Joshua had to get all the people
[1:22:19] in
[1:22:20] order God don't like to confusion God's
[1:22:23] not going to have confusion God is not
[1:22:26] in confusion all right same way with
[1:22:29] this watch this and I can just picture
[1:22:31] this in my mind you got you got
[1:22:33] thousands of people and all these
[1:22:34] different tribes you got the Levites you
[1:22:36] got the priests you got but watch how
[1:22:38] this thing all just comes in order cuz
[1:22:41] they're going to they got to cross
[1:22:42] through one certain section of Jordan
[1:22:44] they don't cross through 14 different
[1:22:45] sections or 14 different doctrines they
[1:22:47] go one way right behind that word of God
[1:22:50] all right and Joshua said un the
[1:22:53] children of Israel come hither and hear
[1:22:54] the word of the Lord your God and Joshua
[1:22:57] said hereby ye shall know that the
[1:22:59] Living God is among
[1:23:01] you he realized God was among those
[1:23:05] people and that he will without fail
[1:23:08] drive out from you the
[1:23:10] Canaanites one Hittites two hivites
[1:23:13] three pites four gesit five amorites 6
[1:23:18] and the jebusites Seven there were seven
[1:23:20] IES that had to go in that land that
[1:23:22] were living there living there and
[1:23:26] Joshua and his army Had to Kill Them All
[1:23:28] Out behold the Ark of the Covenant of
[1:23:30] the Lord of all the Earth passeth over
[1:23:32] before you into Jordan now therefore
[1:23:34] take you 12 men out of the tribe of
[1:23:36] Israel out of every tribe of man and it
[1:23:38] shall come to pass as soon as the soul
[1:23:39] of you feet of the priest that bear the
[1:23:41] ark the Lord of all the Earth shall rest
[1:23:44] in the waters of Jordan that the Waters
[1:23:46] of Jordan shall be cut
[1:23:48] off from the waters that come down from
[1:23:51] above and they shall stand upon a heat
[1:23:53] yeah what are we trying to in this end
[1:23:56] time what are we trying to preach you to
[1:23:58] right a body change amen everybody was
[1:24:01] scared of that Jordan
[1:24:03] River cuz remember when they passed over
[1:24:06] it was out of its Bank it wasn't in just
[1:24:09] a little trickle season cuz in verse 15
[1:24:12] it says for Jordan overflowed all his
[1:24:14] Banks all the time of harvest and that's
[1:24:16] when they crossed over so the Jordan was
[1:24:19] not some little bitty Creek it was some
[1:24:20] big wide Place amen the people were
[1:24:23] feared but verse 14 and it came to pass
[1:24:25] when the people removed from their tents
[1:24:27] to pass over Jordan and the priest
[1:24:29] bearing the Ark of the Covenant before
[1:24:30] the people and as they that bear the ark
[1:24:33] were come un Jordan and the feet of the
[1:24:35] priests that bear the ark were dipped in
[1:24:36] the brim of the water what the Bible say
[1:24:39] blessed are the feet right of them that
[1:24:42] carry the gospel the good news you go
[1:24:45] over in the Old and New Testament all
[1:24:47] right and as they that bear the ark were
[1:24:49] come to Jordan and the feet of the
[1:24:50] priest that bear the ark were dipped
[1:24:51] into the brim of the the water for
[1:24:52] Jordan overflowed all its banks all the
[1:24:54] time of the Harvest that the waters
[1:24:56] which came down from above stood and
[1:24:58] Rose up upon a heat very far from the
[1:25:01] city Adam that is beside zaratan and
[1:25:03] those that came down toward the Sea of
[1:25:05] the plain even the salt sea failed and
[1:25:07] were cut off and the people passed over
[1:25:10] right against Jericho right and the
[1:25:13] priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant
[1:25:15] of the Lord stood firm amen they weren't
[1:25:19] on Shaky
[1:25:20] Ground they weren't on ship ing
[1:25:23] sand listen to the I try to take the
[1:25:26] words of this Bible and make them come
[1:25:28] alive amen they stood firm on dry ground
[1:25:32] right in the midst of Jordan and all the
[1:25:35] Israelites passed over on dry ground
[1:25:37] unto all the people were past I can just
[1:25:40] see them walk right past those priests
[1:25:42] right and knowing that they were the
[1:25:45] ones that were keeping that death off of
[1:25:46] them

[1:28:05] a palm tree right that's right that's
[1:28:08] right it wasn't a picnic it was a battle
[1:28:12] they didn't go to Jordan on
[1:28:16] vacation you didn't hear what I said go
[1:28:18] in and possess right possess the lamb
[1:28:22] means you take it you go in and possess
[1:28:24] the land right for the priest which bear
[1:28:27] the ark verse 10 stood in the midst of
[1:28:28] Jordan until everything was finished
[1:28:34] right see people were
[1:28:37] servants we're servants song leaders and
[1:28:41] we are servants I want people to realize
[1:28:44] that we are servants to the people in
[1:28:46] the congregation right amen and you
[1:28:49] should have this in your posted in your
[1:28:52] brain until everything was finished
[1:28:54] those priests didn't move exactly they
[1:28:58] stood still right there in the middle of
[1:28:59] Jordan Waters was pushed
[1:29:03] back until everything was finished that
[1:29:05] the Lord commanded Joshua to speak unto
[1:29:08] the people according to all that Moses
[1:29:10] commanded Joshua and the people hasted
[1:29:13] and passed over all
[1:29:16] right and then verse 14 say on that day
[1:29:19] the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight
[1:29:20] of all Israel and they feared him as
[1:29:22] they feared Moses all the days of his
[1:29:24] life all right now here we go in chapter
[1:29:28] 5 and we'll be finished right
[1:29:32] here now they already what they done was
[1:29:35] they had waited Brother Richard they
[1:29:38] waited till they got everything in order
[1:29:40] oh yeah priest stood in the water water
[1:29:43] receded back the people walk across into
[1:29:48] the promised land but they didn't just
[1:29:49] go running like a bunch of wild Banshees
[1:29:52] running around looking oh God we got the
[1:29:53] land we're here no watch this they were
[1:29:56] still in their order they were still in
[1:29:58] a camp they come went a cross and they
[1:30:00] stopped cuz remember Joshua said go over
[1:30:03] the land and then wait and then the
[1:30:04] priest if you'll keep reading when the
[1:30:06] last person crossed over when that
[1:30:08] priest that last priest foot stepped out
[1:30:10] of that right out of that water it
[1:30:14] everything went back right all right so
[1:30:16] they were in the promised land but there
[1:30:17] was something had to happen until they
[1:30:19] went and were positionally placed until
[1:30:22] they something had to happen so they can
[1:30:24] drive out these hivites Hittites and
[1:30:26] jebusites and all those other ites all
[1:30:28] right and it came to pass when all the
[1:30:29] kings of the amorites which were on the
[1:30:31] side Jordan 5 ver1 trying to hurry
[1:30:33] Westward and all the kings of the
[1:30:34] Canaanites which were by the Sea heard
[1:30:36] that the Lord had dried up the Waters of
[1:30:38] the Jordan so let's think about this for
[1:30:41] a minute there was an internet back then
[1:30:45] there was an
[1:30:46] email so these Kings had to hear that
[1:30:49] that something happened in Jordan so so
[1:30:51] they must have been there for a little
[1:30:53] while getting ready all right that's why
[1:30:56] you you know you well let's just get
[1:30:58] into this and all the kings of the
[1:31:00] Canaanites which were by the Sea heard
[1:31:02] that the Lord had dried up the Waters of
[1:31:03] Jordan from before the children of
[1:31:05] Israel until we until we were passed
[1:31:07] over that their heart melted neither was
[1:31:10] their spirit in them anymore because of
[1:31:13] the children of
[1:31:14] Israel right remember what Rahab told
[1:31:17] him said from the time y'all got over
[1:31:20] there and beat them Kings up and did all
[1:31:21] that stuff said there's been no fight in
[1:31:24] us we hadn't even wanted to fight you in
[1:31:26] other words we would have opened up the
[1:31:27] gates of Jericho probably if you have
[1:31:29] asked us you
[1:31:30] know and let you in that's why everybody
[1:31:33] didn't want they didn't want remember
[1:31:35] the Ark of the Covenant somebody stole
[1:31:36] it one time and they took his same back
[1:31:38] cuz it caused them so much problems you
[1:31:39] know if you if you're not of God that's
[1:31:42] like when we were Sinners we didn't want
[1:31:44] nothing to do with God we didn't want we
[1:31:45] didn't want no Ark in our in our uh TV
[1:31:48] room right we want no Arc in in our in
[1:31:52] our in our room where we did our little
[1:31:54] secret things you know read in magazines
[1:31:56] and all that we didn't want art well
[1:31:58] that's exactly what these people these
[1:31:59] Kings did they don't want no Ark around
[1:32:01] nowhere yeah verse
[1:32:03] two at that time the Lord said unto
[1:32:06] Joshua make the sharp knives and
[1:32:08] circumcise again the children of Israel
[1:32:11] the second time and Joshua made him
[1:32:14] sharp knives and circumcised the
[1:32:17] children of Israel at the hill of the
[1:32:18] foreskin and this is the cause why
[1:32:21] Joshua did circumcise all the people
[1:32:24] that came out of Egypt that were males
[1:32:26] even all the men of War died in the
[1:32:27] wilderness by the way after they came
[1:32:29] out of Egypt now all the people that
[1:32:31] came out were circumcised but all the
[1:32:34] people that were born in the wilderness
[1:32:36] by the way as they came forth out of
[1:32:37] Egypt them they had not circumcised for
[1:32:40] the children of Israel walked 40 years
[1:32:42] in the wilderness till all the people
[1:32:43] that were Men of War which came out of
[1:32:45] Egypt were consumed because they obeyed
[1:32:46] not the voice of God so it really
[1:32:49] doesn't um when Paul said circumcision
[1:32:52] or uncircumcision doesn't matter cuz
[1:32:54] they were all circumcised which was the
[1:32:56] type of the new birth but Jesus said
[1:32:57] they were everyone dead eternally
[1:33:00] separated right so that circumcision
[1:33:02] didn't do them any good because what
[1:33:04] here's the key they obeyed not the voice
[1:33:07] of God right right same way with you and
[1:33:10] I and their children whom he raised up
[1:33:13] in their
[1:33:14] stad them Joshua circumcised for they
[1:33:17] were uncircumcised because they had not
[1:33:19] circumcised them by the way and it came
[1:33:21] to pass when they had done circumcising
[1:33:24] all the people that they Abode in their
[1:33:25] places in the camp till they were whole
[1:33:28] I heard a preacher preach one time said
[1:33:29] they walked a lot different yeah if
[1:33:31] you're a male you'll understand what I'm
[1:33:33] talking about you're circumcised and
[1:33:35] you're 20 or something years old you
[1:33:36] walk a little bit different until you're
[1:33:38] till you're okay but that's the way it
[1:33:39] is listen and the Lord said unto Joshua
[1:33:43] this day have I rolled away exactly the
[1:33:46] reproach of Egypt from off of you right
[1:33:51] from off of
[1:33:54] you wherefore the name of this place is
[1:33:56] called gilgal unto this day which is
[1:33:58] called the hill of the force again and
[1:34:00] the children of Israel encamped in
[1:34:01] gilgal and kept the Passover on the 14th
[1:34:04] day of the month at even in the plains
[1:34:05] of Jericho and they did eat of the old
[1:34:08] corn of the land on the marrow after the
[1:34:10] Passover unleavened cakes and parched
[1:34:12] corn in the self same day and the Mana
[1:34:14] ceased on the Marl after they had eaten
[1:34:16] of the old corn of the land neither had
[1:34:18] the children of Israel Mana anymore
[1:34:20] right but they did eat of the fruit to
[1:34:21] the land of Canaan that year now and it
[1:34:24] came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho
[1:34:26] they lifted up his eyes and looked and
[1:34:27] behold there stood a man now this is
[1:34:30] after he's in the promised land over
[1:34:32] against him with a sword drawn in his
[1:34:33] hand and Joshua went unto him and said
[1:34:35] unto him art thou for us or for our
[1:34:37] adversary and he said nay but as captain
[1:34:39] of the host of the Lord am I now
[1:34:43] come in other words he's here now right
[1:34:47] and Joshua fell on his face of the Earth
[1:34:48] and did worship and said unto him what
[1:34:50] saith my Lord to his
[1:34:54] servant now
[1:34:56] listen here's what I saw this and the
[1:34:59] captain of the Lord's host said unto
[1:35:00] Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot
[1:35:02] for the place wherein thou standest is
[1:35:04] Holy and Joshua did so now
[1:35:07] Moses Moses did the same thing but Moses
[1:35:11] Heard a Voice out of a
[1:35:14] bush Joshua saw man amen look at the
[1:35:17] Revelation right Moses saw a burning
[1:35:20] bush he heard the voice of God now
[1:35:21] afterwards we know he spoke lip to ear
[1:35:23] and saw God but Joshua is looking face
[1:35:25] to face with his captain of the host
[1:35:27] amen he said loose off your shoes from
[1:35:29] off your feet for that place where you
[1:35:30] stand is Holy now listen to this let's
[1:35:33] go to Joshua 24 and we'll be
[1:35:37] finished this is coming to the end of
[1:35:40] Joshua's life but listen to what he's
[1:35:43] telling them chapter
[1:35:49] 24 and then we're going to reading
[1:35:51] Deuteronomy but I want you to listen to
[1:35:54] this cuz I want us to realize one
[1:35:57] thing God has already prepared the land
[1:36:01] for you and
[1:36:02] I it was prepared before the foundation
[1:36:05] of the world but you and I have to go in
[1:36:06] but listen listen to what he said see if
[1:36:08] this sounds familiar verse
[1:36:12] 13 and I have he's talking about getting
[1:36:15] rid of all the verse 11 verse 11 you got
[1:36:17] all the amorites andesites canites hites
[1:36:20] gites and I delivered them into your
[1:36:22] hand now see this is after Joshua had
[1:36:24] always kill the
[1:36:26] people and I have given you a land for
[1:36:29] which you did not labor
[1:36:33] amen and cities which you built
[1:36:38] not and you dwell in them of The
[1:36:42] Vineyards and Olive yards which you
[1:36:45] planted
[1:36:47] not do you eat that sound like a future
[1:36:50] home
[1:36:51] right see in the Millennium that's not
[1:36:53] right cuz we build houses and inhabit
[1:36:55] but in the future home it's already
[1:36:57] built for us amen it's already done
[1:37:00] after we after the battle's over after
[1:37:01] all this fighting and I have given you a
[1:37:04] land for which you did not labor we're
[1:37:06] not going to build that house we're not
[1:37:08] going to build a future homehouse
[1:37:10] remember Jesus said I go away and
[1:37:11] prepare a place for you and cities you
[1:37:15] built not and you dwell in them of The
[1:37:17] Vineyards and Olive Garden which ye
[1:37:19] planted not do eat now therefore fear
[1:37:22] the lord and serve him in
[1:37:24] sincerity and in truth and put away the
[1:37:28] gods which your father served on the
[1:37:30] other side of the flood and in Egypt and
[1:37:33] serve you the Lord let's read that again
[1:37:36] and put away the
[1:37:37] doctrines which your fathers served on
[1:37:40] the other side of the flood and in Egypt
[1:37:41] and serve you the Lord and if it seem
[1:37:44] evil unto you to serve the Lord choose
[1:37:46] you this day whom you will serve whether
[1:37:48] the gods which your father served that
[1:37:50] were in the other side of the flood are
[1:37:51] the gods of the amorites in whose land
[1:37:53] you dwell but as for me and my house
[1:37:57] amen we will serve the Lord we'll not
[1:38:00] read Deuteronomy 11 because it's
[1:38:01] basically the same thing but he G he
[1:38:04] give us a land amen read the book of
[1:38:06] Joshua cuz brother Dale's been in
[1:38:09] Ephesians brother Brown preached the
[1:38:11] sermon Ephesians parallels Joshua Joshua
[1:38:13] and and Ephesians are what a a placing
[1:38:16] Joshua physically placed a group of
[1:38:18] people in the land in Ephesians Paul was
[1:38:20] trying to place the people in the land
[1:38:22] all right but now remember what did Paul
[1:38:25] place his people in the land or was he
[1:38:27] prophesying that there was a people
[1:38:28] going to be in the land that that God
[1:38:29] was going to place by what Paul said
[1:38:32] because Paul didn't have a group of
[1:38:33] people that was that was positionally
[1:38:35] placed the adoption stage the adoption
[1:38:37] on stage that's why brother R said only
[1:38:39] in this age brother and sister only in
[1:38:41] this age is the adoption what the
[1:38:43] placing amen so let's not just go over
[1:38:46] and possess the land sure I was telling
[1:38:48] them this morning in the part we're
[1:38:50] doing about about the seals I can't give
[1:38:52] them a revelation everybody's want like

[1:46:54] let's focus Joshua and Caleb that's what
[1:46:56] I want you to get if you get nothing
[1:46:57] else one thing Joshua and Caleb took a
[1:47:00] group and got them so focused to where
[1:47:04] they just reacted when Joshua and Caleb
[1:47:07] told them what to do they just fell
[1:47:08] right in line the priest went first
[1:47:10] Joshua was just set he just sat there
[1:47:12] and he just talked to them you do this
[1:47:14] you do this you do this you do this you
[1:47:16] do well is the holy spirit confused I
[1:47:19] don't think so the holy spirit is what's
[1:47:21] placing all this together he's not
[1:47:22] confused that's right and we're not
[1:47:25] supposed to be you know the blind
[1:47:26] leading the blind but you know we are
[1:47:28] sheep right and sheep can't do nothing
[1:47:32] for theel sheep have to be led we all
[1:47:35] think we're real strong well yeah we may
[1:47:37] be strong but we're still Sheep amen
[1:47:39] Jesus said we were sheep so we're sheep
[1:47:43] and we have to have a Shepherd that
[1:47:44] takes that staff and you know puts us in
[1:47:48] the way that's why the hooks on the end
[1:47:50] of it so he can reach and get you
[1:47:51] sometime and jerk you back in the fold
[1:47:54] same way with the word of God but it's
[1:47:56] done with kindness and it's done with
[1:47:58] reverence and it's done with fear of the
[1:48:00] Lord there's not a lot of time left
[1:48:02] people and I'm not trying to scare
[1:48:03] anybody but there's not a lot of time
[1:48:05] left right we can say that but even a
[1:48:08] day we're a day closer to to getting the
[1:48:11] glory than we were yesterday amen right
[1:48:14] amen let's all do one thing bind
[1:48:17] together right keep that old root of
[1:48:19] bitterness out of us get it away from us

[1:50:57] go right into the communion and if you
[1:50:59] want to turn with us in 1 Corinthians 11
[1:51:03] verse
[1:51:03] 23 for I have received of the Lord that
[1:51:06] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:51:07] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:51:09] was betrayed took bread when he had
[1:51:12] given thanks he broke it and said take
[1:51:13] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:51:16] you this do in remembrance of me after
[1:51:19] the same manner also so he took the cup
[1:51:20] when he had s saying this cup is the New
[1:51:23] Testament in my blood this do ye as
[1:51:25] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:51:27] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:51:29] and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's
[1:51:31] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:51:34] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:51:37] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:51:39] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[1:51:41] let a man examine himself and so let him
[1:51:43] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[1:51:46] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:51:47] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:51:50] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:51:52] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:51:54] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:51:57] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:51:58] be judged that's the scripture I love
[1:52:00] right there that's right but when we are
[1:52:03] judged we are chasen to the Lord that we
[1:52:06] should not be condemned with the world
[1:52:08] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:52:10] together t one for another to eat t one
[1:52:13] for another and if any man hunger let
[1:52:15] him eat at home that you come not
[1:52:17] together under condemnation and the rest
[1:52:19] will set in order when I come let's just
[1:52:22] have a few moments of Silent prayer just
[1:52:24] praying one for the other and just
[1:52:26] remembering you know each other in the
[1:52:29] Lord that's right and everything before
[1:52:31] we go on into the
[1:52:45] communion thank you Father because we
[1:52:47] love you we commit all into your hands
[1:52:51] in Jesus
[1:52:53] name now anybody have anything to say
[1:52:56] before we go into the
[1:53:07] communion the Bible said he took bread
[1:53:10] and blessed it father we thank you for
[1:53:12] this bread it's been made for this
[1:53:14] purpose today and Lord Jesus we know
[1:53:17] that it represents Thy word it's not thy
[1:53:19] body but it represents Thy word that as
[1:53:23] we eat the word and Lord as our brother
[1:53:26] just read when they entered the promised
[1:53:28] land the the old the the
[1:53:31] manist and it become the old corn of the
[1:53:34] land which was a stronger understanding
[1:53:37] what's the same bread Lord we thank you
[1:53:40] for this and we ask you to just give us
[1:53:41] an understanding of Thy word that we may
[1:53:44] Lord all be together as you we ask you
[1:53:46] to sanctify the bread and the partakers
[1:53:49] that we may may all be together as one
[1:53:52] in the Lord in Jesus
[1:54:13] name never do this and I I think about
[1:54:16] the children of Israel in their final
[1:54:18] night before they
[1:54:20] left heading toward the promised
[1:54:23] land they had the
[1:54:25] communion they had a natural meal back
[1:54:27] there but then there was the things that
[1:54:29] was left over that they didn't truly
[1:54:32] understand then Jesus took that and they
[1:54:34] and he said all right now this part is
[1:54:38] what we're going to do we're going to
[1:54:39] I'm going to show you what this means
[1:54:42] and he opened their understanding of the
[1:54:44] scriptures of what he was doing and how
[1:54:47] they what they done all of the times in
[1:54:49] the Years
[1:54:50] before and he instituted what we call
[1:54:53] the the Lord's
[1:55:03] Supper it's a serious matter because
[1:55:06] what we used to do when we was in the
[1:55:08] churches years ago we we'd order bread
[1:55:11] and keep it for 3 months and put it in
[1:55:13] the freezer do all like
[1:55:16] that see we didn't know what it meant
[1:55:19] did right amen then we use grape juice
[1:55:22] things are those order father we thank
[1:55:24] you for this wine it's gone through the
[1:55:26] process and now Lord gets better each
[1:55:28] day and that's a an example of your love
[1:55:31] and grace unto each one of us and the
[1:55:33] greatest of all the Revelation that you
[1:55:35] given to each one of our hearts we ask
[1:55:38] you now Lord that you would just bless
[1:55:40] it it's an example of your blood which
[1:55:42] was shed for each one of us but lord
[1:55:45] it's not the blood but it's just an
[1:55:47] example of it it's not the the the
[1:55:49] things of life that we need we need only
[1:55:52] you we love you and we thank you we ask
[1:55:55] you as we take the bread and then to
[1:55:57] drink the little portion of wine that
[1:55:59] it'll come together in our bodies and
[1:56:01] Lord tomorrow it'll make blood sails in
[1:56:04] each and every one of us we love you and
[1:56:06] we thank you sanctify the wine and the

[1:57:38] carry my cross through the
[1:57:44] mid come
[1:57:48] morning
[1:57:50] for
[1:57:51] me you know people might say well I've
[1:57:54] never been to a communion where that
[1:57:56] they sang and done and there's always
[1:57:58] been a light reverence well that's
[1:58:01] that's good that's just not the way we
[1:58:03] do here we just are different people but
[1:58:06] you know I got it marked in my Bible in
[1:58:09] the Book of Psalms there that there was
[1:58:10] like three Psalms that they sang as they
[1:58:14] were entering the temple for worship you
[1:58:17] know coming in and uh
[1:58:19] you know that would be something if we
[1:58:22] just line up outside you know sing those
[1:58:25] songs as we came in to bringing us into
[1:58:28] the presence of the Lord to where we
[1:58:31] would do that see we don't do it but we
[1:58:33] should pray and get ourselves right and
[1:58:36] get our thoughts in the right order as
[1:58:38] we're coming in because we're coming in
[1:58:40] to serve God and coming in to hear from
[1:58:42] him they believe so much until they
[1:58:45] found a scroll one time that they hadn't
[1:58:46] been able to had had and yep you know
[1:58:49] what they done and I think it took about
[1:58:51] six hours seem like that they read the
[1:58:53] scroll and then they worshiped for six
[1:58:56] hours you know am now because they
[1:58:59] really realized see we found something
[1:59:02] from God that we didn't have amen so
[1:59:07] then we you know we cherish it
[1:59:18] right
[1:59:23] amen let's all protect
[1:59:36] together you can be seated for a moment
[1:59:38] while we get ready for
[1:59:44] now have the put
[1:59:48] worship
[2:00:05] John
[2:00:08] 13 and supper being ended the devil
[2:00:11] having now put in the heart of Judas his
[2:00:13] carot Simon's son to betray him Jesus
[2:00:16] knowing that the father had given all
[2:00:17] things into his hands and that was come
[2:00:19] from God and went to God he rises from
[2:00:23] supper and laid aside his garments and
[2:00:26] took a towel and GED himself after that
[2:00:29] he poured water into a basin and began
[2:00:32] to wash the disciples feet and to wipe
[2:00:33] them with a towel where with he was
[2:00:35] Gerty then cometh he to Simon Peter and
[2:00:38] Peter saith unto him Lord does thou wash
[2:00:41] my feet Jesus answered and said unto him
[2:00:44] what I do thou knowest not now but Thou
[2:00:47] shalt know Hereafter Peter said sayth
[2:00:49] unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet
[2:00:52] Jesus answered him if I wash thee not
[2:00:55] thou H has no part with me Simon Peter
[2:00:57] Sith unto him Lord not my feet only but
[2:01:00] also my hands and my head Jesus Sith

[2:01:11] not all for he knew who should betray
[2:01:14] him therefore said he you are not all
[2:01:16] clean so after he had washed their feet
[2:01:20] and had taken his garments and was set
[2:01:21] down again he said unto
