[15:37] seating parts you know not getting
[15:40] together in too close to the communion
[15:42] as far as that part and too we will have
[15:45] communion next Sunday but we will not
[15:48] have any foot washing because we'll just
[15:50] back away from that part of course we're
[15:52] trying to do everything to keep
[15:55] everything running in an order that can
[15:58] be an orderly thing you know and and
[16:02] doing that so just remember that next
[16:04] Sunday the Lord willing we'll be taking
[16:06] our communion you know okay let's see
[16:10] Richard is on the way home supposed to
[16:13] be traveling back in today from his dad
[16:15] so remember that and just keep him in in
[16:18] your prayers it over take care of him
[16:20] talk to brother Colley this week they
[16:24] have determined that he does have
[16:26] prostate cancer but they said that they
[16:30] thought it was treatable
[16:32] that there was not any problems with
[16:34] that and he so wants to be in church but
[16:38] you know how it is sister Johnny can't
[16:40] drive and brother Doherty can't drive
[16:42] because like he said about brother
[16:44] Doherty said the devil just working on
[16:46] him said brother Colley said he said
[16:48] every time he tries to go get something
[16:51] done for his I said he gets worse so
[16:54] let's just keep praying harder and
[16:56] harder because somebody's stirring up
[16:58] the devil in that line so pray that the
[17:01] Lord would take care of him you know one
[17:03] you'd ever
[17:04] where they can get a traffic you know
[17:05] get a way to drive backwards and forth
[17:07] because um know that there are a lot of
[17:09] there

[17:13] today remember him and pray to Lord we
[17:15] bless and our Lord willing he'll be
[17:17] ministering this coming Wednesday for us
[17:20] here to church okay any other
[17:22] announcements that's very close to where
[17:26] we're going so if you'd like to turn in
[17:28] your scriptures turning revelations 19
[17:32] and we'll begin reading in verse 7
[17:35] through 16 and try to continue our
[17:39] thought from last Sunday's message of
[17:41] you know the name of God and then we'll
[17:45] try to pick up today to get on over into
[17:48] the New Testament to pick up the name
[17:51] Jesus and have a better understanding
[17:53] I'm gonna pray that the Lord would would
[17:55] open our understanding to that father we
[17:57] thank you for your grace and your love
[18:00] and to us we thank you for Calvary and
[18:02] we praise your great name we ask you to
[18:04] just be with us now and let's your love
[18:06] be there and just help us all to walk in
[18:09] the light of your love and you be with
[18:11] us Lord in this day and time across the
[18:14] land and the whole world and all of
[18:16] these problems with the viruses and
[18:19] things but yet you promised to be with
[18:21] your little bride and to take care of us
[18:24] so we're not we're not depending upon
[18:26] ourselves we're depending upon you and
[18:29] there's no way that the enemy can come
[18:31] in and bring these things upon us the
[18:34] word says your prophet taught it to us
[18:36] you that you would take care of us and
[18:39] there's no way the enemy can come unless
[18:41] you allow it so Lord we just put
[18:44] everything into your hands and believing
[18:46] you and trusting you in the day in the
[18:49] hour that we're living forgive our sins
[18:51] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[18:53] guide us and keep us in your love in
[18:56] Jesus name I hope we get to this
[19:01] scripture today that will cease all
[19:04] right we're going to verse 7 revelations
[19:07] 19 let us be glad and rejoice and give
[19:11] honour to him for the marriage of the
[19:13] lamb has come and his wife hath made
[19:16] herself ready
[19:17] and to her it was granted that she
[19:19] should be arrayed in fine linen clean
[19:22] and white for the fine linen is the
[19:24] righteousness of saints he saith unto me
[19:29] write blessed are they which are called
[19:32] unto the marriage supper of the Lamb and
[19:35] he saith unto me these are the true
[19:37] sayings of God and I fell at his feet to
[19:39] worship him and he said unto me see thou
[19:42] do it not I am thy fellow-servant and of
[19:46] thy brethren that have the testimony of
[19:49] Jesus worship God for the testimony of
[19:52] Jesus is the spirit of prophecy and I
[19:55] saw heaven opened and behold a white
[19:57] horse and he that sat upon him was
[20:00] called faithful and true and in
[20:02] righteousness he said he does judge and
[20:05] make war
[20:07] his eyes were his eyes were as a flame
[20:11] of fire and on his head were many crowns
[20:15] and he had a name written that no man
[20:17] knew but he himself he was clothed with
[20:21] a vessel dipped in blood and his name is
[20:24] called the Word of God the armies which
[20:28] were in heaven followed him upon white
[20:30] horses clothed in fine linen white and
[20:33] clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp
[20:36] sword that with it he should smite the
[20:41] nation's and he shall rule them with a
[20:43] rod of iron and thread of the winepress
[20:46] of the fierceness or the wrath of
[20:47] Almighty God he says and he has on his
[20:51] vesture and on his thigh a name written
[20:54] watch all of this about a named king of
[20:58] kings and Lord of lords is that name all
[21:01] right you may be seated the Lord at his
[21:04] blessing to the reading of the word I
[21:08] want to try to continue the thought from
[21:11] last Sunday's message that you know to
[21:18] bring it to a point to where that we can
[21:21] follow God's Word I'd like to see
[21:24] something over here and the word and
[21:26] bring it through and bring it out to an
[21:28] end or whatever you want to call it
[21:30] and come to that point now what was our
[21:33] thoughts that we were talking about last
[21:35] Sunday all right it says in Genesis 1
[21:39] and that's 32 or three times that in
[21:42] Genesis 1 it says in God and it's g.o.d
[21:47] all right now
[21:49] and that is used all the way through
[21:51] into the all the way through there I
[21:54] read it and it says that God created the
[21:57] world God created yes God created that
[21:59] alright but then when you get over to
[22:02] chapter 2 and especially chapter 3
[22:05] you'll find a word added in there and
[22:08] it'll say the Lord God all right now
[22:14] that continues then throughout the Old
[22:18] Testament all the way up through in true
[22:22] and we'll follow into the New Testament
[22:24] - to see but my point was why would it
[22:31] be staying in one section of the Old
[22:34] Testament before do you've watch that or
[22:36] read it and what do it well read it real
[22:39] careful because it has drastic meanings
[22:42] to it that you read here of God will see
[22:44] God is not a name we saw what's the name
[22:50] of God his name is God we'll see that's
[22:52] that's not you make a God out of
[22:55] anything see God is not a name God is a
[22:59] title to a night and back they're the
[23:03] best they could do came out with the
[23:05] word Elohim for God our God for Elohim
[23:09] using that an Elohim means the self
[23:12] existing or he that exists throughout
[23:16] eternity you know and it tells it out
[23:20] but it doesn't give a name alright then
[23:24] you come up we did to Lord God we're
[23:27] done second chapter third coming to come
[23:30] all the way through as I said to the Old
[23:32] Testament and you find Lord God and you
[23:36] see in that that it's trying to describe
[23:38] and what they were doing what they read
[23:41] in trying to put over into
[23:43] a readable language for us and for
[23:47] translating it and they put down our
[23:49] Lord God all right see now God being
[23:54] self-existing why would it pick up some
[23:58] another title because that's what it is
[24:01] God is a title to a name it is not a
[24:05] name it's a title to a night well I've
[24:08] been told all of my life God's name is
[24:10] God well in heaven help us if that's as
[24:15] far as we can go
[24:17] I had enough of that knowledge when I
[24:19] was in the Baptist Church that I knew
[24:21] that God was not a name it was a title
[24:24] to a name all right now then you go -
[24:28] Lord God Lord is not a name it's a title
[24:33] alright and that title is picked up or
[24:36] derived from the wording the best they
[24:38] could do to come out with the word
[24:40] Jehovah
[24:42] alright so now when you go from Genesis
[24:46] one of understanding it opens up in
[24:49] Genesis 2 to describe this one in
[24:52] Genesis 1 that's doing this
[24:54] God created God crea then in Genesis 2
[24:56] you'll find that the Lord God created
[24:59] well it must be the same person there's
[25:03] only one creator alright and that's the
[25:06] word alright
[25:08] see the word is the Creator so then you
[25:10] come up to Lord God which is Jehovah
[25:12] Elohim Jehovah means like a father with
[25:16] his family that's the best basics you
[25:19] can come up with a name there and using
[25:22] that point that to understand it means
[25:24] like a father with his family so as you
[25:27] come on over from Genesis 1 in the
[25:29] creation and then all at once you find
[25:32] God becoming a creator of human beings
[25:37] and then he picks up the title of
[25:40] Jehovah and it becomes Jehovah Elohim
[25:44] alright now you can come all the way
[25:46] through your Old Testament bringing it
[25:48] to the basis of Jehovah Jireh the 7
[25:51] compound names of Jehovah and all the
[25:54] way through the Old Testament using that
[25:56] when you run across it and you'll see
[25:58] the Lord God go back and read those
[26:00] things it's very valuable to us
[26:03] you said well I've dropped just I'm just
[26:05] simple well that's what I thought I was
[26:07] I've never found out yet it I wasn't
[26:10] simple because that's what I am is very
[26:13] simple it just to take the terminologies
[26:16] and follow it and especially in the day
[26:18] that we live see we have the prophets
[26:20] message to describe it so all of this
[26:23] that I'm describing to you has been
[26:25] taught by your prophet when you get into
[26:28] the Godhead into the things of
[26:30] understanding he's the one that came up
[26:33] with these things and see Elohim is not
[26:36] a name Jehovah is not a name God's not a
[26:39] name then when you get into all of those
[26:43] titles and things you know of Yahweh and
[26:46] in a dawna ever how you pronounce that
[26:49] part
[26:51] all of that is titles to a name because
[26:56] God's name could never be pronounced
[27:01] alright it is actually if you've got
[27:04] them laying right here where the Prophet
[27:06] said it it's jvh you all right and the
[27:12] best they could do was to come up with
[27:14] Jehovah but I'm not nothing major than
[27:19] anything I'll just make just kind of
[27:22] have a little common sense see if you
[27:24] can't pronounce a name then there's
[27:27] something hidden within that name there
[27:30] is a great thing that you need to be
[27:32] able to follow that all right
[27:35] see so then back in the Old Testament
[27:37] when he was known as Jehovah the that
[27:42] was a title to a name of the person or
[27:46] being of Almighty God all right
[27:50] and in doing that then you come up to
[27:52] the point of trying to find his name
[27:55] well we'll call him this we'll call him
[27:57] that what is his name well he said well
[28:03] his name was got nothing on God
[28:08] and his name wasn't L of him that's
[28:11] still a title to a name his name wasn't
[28:14] Jehovah that's still a title to a name
[28:18] there was no name there to be able to do
[28:21] and they couldn't as I said go back and
[28:24] read you I'll give you what the prophet
[28:25] has said there was no way to pronounce
[28:27] the name
[28:28] it's j vh v aj vh u excuse me all right
[28:34] now you English major sometimes you you
[28:38] get into it and and help me out a little
[28:40] bit but remember there is only one vowel
[28:44] you got to have vowels everybody gonna
[28:47] knows what daddy
[28:48] that's the AEIOU that is that all of
[28:52] them that's the vowels okay we'll get a
[28:55] little English today ae oh you all right
[29:00] so you have one letter in the jvh you
[29:05] because I see you you have one vowel so
[29:08] there's no way to pronounce the name
[29:09] you've got to have the vowels to be able
[29:13] to comprehend the pronunciation are what
[29:16] you're doing with that name so there was
[29:19] no way to do it so they just put the
[29:20] best that could do and they wrote
[29:22] Jehovah but it's in Isaiah or I wrote it
[29:29] down yesterday I was gonna bring it in
[29:30] the RM sleeping but but see God said in
[29:34] the Old Testament their sin in Isaiah or
[29:36] one of them he said by my name Jehovah
[29:38] was I never known you run upon as your
[29:42] hover witness and they start talking to
[29:44] you about his name being Java so what
[29:46] okay here answer this scripture here he
[29:48] said by my name Jove I've never known
[29:51] the he couldn't be not be known but the
[29:55] jvh you and I said the best they could
[29:57] do was come up to Jehovah but those are
[30:02] titles to a name and he was known of
[30:04] Jehovah the Old Testament okay now
[30:06] that's where we like to the prophet to
[30:08] get her understanding to the point he
[30:11] said to Jehovah the old is the Jesus of
[30:14] the new okay see now we can find the
[30:18] name and that's what we were trying to
[30:20] do with that
[30:21] was to find his name because the name of
[30:25] God all right and see when it comes
[30:29] through the Old Testament all the way
[30:31] through you have no way to comprehend
[30:34] that to understand it okay now as you do
[30:41] then you wind up in a position to work I
[30:44] said go ahead number uh I'm jumping so
[30:48] okay go ahead and number four bring up
[30:52] number four now remember the point there
[30:57] was no way to pronounce the name so they
[31:01] don't the best they could do and they
[31:03] put it to jvh you but there's no way to
[31:08] pronounce that so they got to come down
[31:09] to something so they tried it by using
[31:11] jehovah all right but now that still
[31:18] doesn't give you the understanding what
[31:22] is his name but I remember and we'll
[31:26] read this here that when you come to
[31:29] Moses at the burning bush that's where
[31:32] this is then Moses was told I am the God
[31:44] of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I make it
[31:54] plain so it's sensible to human language
[31:56] Moses was standing there and he says I
[31:59] know the God of Abraham
[32:00] I've studied about him I've heard about
[32:03] him I know about the God of Abraham the
[32:06] god of Isaac the God of Jacob etc but
[32:10] now when I go down there they're gonna
[32:12] ask me your name and says what is your
[32:20] name
[32:25] you know let's carry this out over into
[32:28] what we're talking about so let's start
[32:30] reading a little bit Exodus 3 6 through
[32:33] 8 this is Moses at the burning bush
[32:35] remember what happened he comes up he
[32:38] finds a bush burning and he said I'll
[32:40] turn aside to see why the bush is not
[32:42] burning up all right when he does God
[32:44] says take off your shoes because the
[32:46] ground is holy and all like that all
[32:48] right but look moreover he said now this
[32:53] is God speaking to Moses I am the God of
[32:58] thy father now forgive me for putting in
[33:04] without injecting on anything but let me
[33:07] read it this way moreover he said I am
[33:10] the God of thy father I am the God of
[33:13] Abraham I am the god of Isaac and I also
[33:18] am the God of Jacob no I didn't inject
[33:23] anything I was just reading it bringing
[33:25] it to a point to where you were see that
[33:27] the same one was speaking okay and Moses
[33:33] hid his face for he was afraid to look
[33:35] upon God and the Lord said little dogs
[33:39] go back to that big capital Lord and
[33:41] things that we had understanded with
[33:43] when you see the capital Lord it4s up in
[33:46] phrases meaning God of glory when you
[33:49] see it in a lowercase L Ord you'll find
[33:53] it can be many things that can be
[33:54] brother Donnie in the Old English can i
[33:57] can say my lord my lord come in the
[34:00] house my lord urgency its difference in
[34:03] languages but when it's got that big
[34:05] capital it's only speaking of the one
[34:08] yeah I am well now watch what I'm saying
[34:13] the I am that spoke to the father's the
[34:20] I am that was speaking to Abraham of
[34:23] Isaac to Jacob him and to Israel all
[34:26] right and the Lord said I have surely
[34:29] seen the affliction of my people which
[34:31] are in Egypt and have heard their cry by
[34:34] reason of their taskmasters where I know
[34:36] their sorrows
[34:38] and I am come down to deliver them out
[34:44] of the hand of the Egyptians and to
[34:47] bring them up out of that land unto a
[34:50] good land with a large and unto a land
[34:53] flowing with milk and honey unto the
[34:56] place of the Canaanites and the Hittites
[34:58] and i'ma rights in the purchase eyes and
[35:01] the hive eyes and the Jimmy sobs all
[35:04] right now therefore behold the cry of
[35:08] the children of Israel has come unto me
[35:10] and I have also seen the oppression were
[35:13] with the Egyptians oppress them come now
[35:17] therefore and I will send thee he's
[35:25] won't his name and he's gonna send him
[35:28] those are gonna see they're gonna send
[35:30] Moses God said come on now Moses I'm
[35:32] gonna send you that thou must bring
[35:34] forth my people the children of Israel
[35:37] out of Egypt and Moses said unto God Who
[35:42] am I you're the I am Who am I you're
[35:50] trying to determine it you're trying to
[35:51] describe to me something but I'm asking
[35:53] you who am i he said I'm not worthy come
[35:56] on read it all I'm not worthy I can't do
[35:58] this I can't speak I can't do this and
[36:01] all like that right constantly
[36:03] complaining but look what happened Who
[36:06] am I that I should go into Pharaoh that
[36:08] I should bring forth the children of
[36:10] Israel out of Egypt and he said
[36:12] certainly I will be with thee and this
[36:17] shall be a token unto thee that I have
[36:20] sent thee now what's the token look what
[36:23] it is when that has brought forth the
[36:26] people out of Egypt you shall serve God
[36:28] upon this mountain that's exactly where
[36:31] he went when he brought them out of
[36:33] Egypt straight to that mountain right
[36:35] okay and Moses said unto God behold when
[36:40] I come unto the children of Israel and
[36:42] shall say unto them now watch
[36:44] the god of your father's has sent me
[36:47] unto you and they shall say to me
[36:51] what is his name what shall I say unto
[36:55] them now you're gonna read this part in
[37:01] here if you look at it he's saying to
[37:05] Moses he said I'm the God of Abraham I'm
[37:07] the god of Isaac I'm the God of Jacob
[37:09] I'm all right
[37:11] Moses said all of them I know about I've
[37:13] heard about studied about because they
[37:16] kept personal records up through there
[37:18] they didn't just throw it out and and
[37:20] and do nothing they they had records and
[37:23] things they knew and he could say yeah
[37:27] you was with Abraham you was with Isaac
[37:28] he was with Jacob and you say you're
[37:32] going with me but said I need a name
[37:36] because if you're going with me now
[37:38] I believe you was personal day Brian use
[37:40] personal dies it gives personal with
[37:42] Jacob right there with him doing all of
[37:45] the things taking care of him but
[37:47] sitting now who's gonna watch the name
[37:49] I'm gonna tell him right what is that
[37:55] names he and God said unto Moses okay
[37:59] back up what she always say to them God
[38:01] the God of your father's has sent me to
[38:02] you and they shall say to me what is his
[38:04] name what shall I say unto them and God
[38:07] said unto Moses right back where we
[38:14] started all titles and no name
[38:27] now I got one in here where the Prophet
[38:28] said God never had a name until Moses
[38:33] then we'll get to that in a minute if we
[38:35] can hold it what is his name
[38:40] what's your Los Angeles and God said
[38:42] unto Moses I am that I am
[38:48] now this his name that's what he just
[38:52] said what's his name I am that I am and
[39:02] he said thus shalt thou say unto the
[39:05] children of Israel I am hath sent me
[39:08] unto you I don't know 15 and God said
[39:18] moreover unto Moses thus shalt thou say
[39:21] unto the children of Israel the Lord God
[39:24] all of these Jehovah love him all of
[39:28] this coming in from the beginning over -
[39:31] which would cover what a little over
[39:34] 2000 years right because you got a
[39:36] thousand years before the flood and then
[39:39] I mean in in that period of time and
[39:41] then you got coming on over so you down
[39:43] over a thousand years so you got a lot
[39:45] of time that Lord God was used the Lord
[39:50] God of your father's the God of Abraham
[39:51] the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob
[39:55] has sent me unto you this is my name
[39:59] forever okay
[40:09] are you gonna get back inside of what
[40:11] we're talking about
[40:12] what does el ahem mean el ahem means
[40:17] self existing he said I am the self
[40:22] existing Almighty God but I've come down
[40:26] now to dwell with you I've heard my
[40:31] people their cries are good and they're
[40:35] their taskmasters and what they're doing
[40:37] but sit down coming down but I won't
[40:38] send you he says I don't even know your
[40:45] name and you're gonna tell me to go he
[40:54] said I need a little bit more does that
[40:58] plain enough to be human about it Moses
[41:00] was just plainly saying I need a little
[41:01] bit more would you please clarify
[41:04] yourself would you bring this to an
[41:07] understanding to her that I can follow
[41:10] you you and when they say what is your
[41:13] name then I have no trouble saying I am
[41:16] that I am because that's what his name
[41:19] is gonna stay I am that I am it ain't
[41:25] gonna never change
[41:31] come on is Hebrews 13:8 I was gonna read
[41:34] that in the scriptures but I didn't but
[41:36] Hebrews 13:8 is right he's Jesus Christ
[41:38] the same yesterday today and forever
[41:40] what he is he has always been and there
[41:43] always will be he's always the same
[41:45] he said I'll always be there that is my
[41:47] name right this is my name forever go
[41:56] and gather the elders of Israel together
[41:58] and say unto them the Lord God all of
[42:02] these you know about you your parents
[42:04] your understanding you know you you know
[42:07] about Abraham and how happen that were
[42:11] in bondage but he's saying you know what
[42:13] about all of these things you know about
[42:15] Isaac we know about Jacob you know about
[42:17] all these things okay going gather the
[42:21] elders of Israel
[42:22] saying to them the Lord God Jehovah
[42:24] Elohim the self-existing Almighty God
[42:28] dwelling with his family the fathers of
[42:31] Israel and now we're going to get a
[42:36] little bit more
[42:37] we'll get this right the Lord God saying
[42:42] Lord God of Genesis to Genesis 3 4 5 6
[42:46] 10 12 all the way up to where we're at I
[42:48] don't know what exact number which comes
[42:50] into Moses but it's a very short one the
[42:54] Lord God of your father's the God of
[42:55] Abraham and of Isaac of Jacob appeared
[42:59] unto me saying I how surely visited you
[43:01] and seeing that which is done to you and
[43:03] Egypt and I have said I will bring you
[43:06] up out of the afflictions of Egypt unto
[43:10] the land of the Canaanites into the
[43:12] Hittites and my rights and the prettiest
[43:13] sights and highlights and the jebusites
[43:15] unto a land flowing with milk and honey
[43:19] they shall hearken unto thy voice the
[43:24] ones they shall hearken to that voice
[43:28] that shall come thou and the elders of
[43:32] Israel unto the king of Egypt and ye
[43:39] shall say unto Him the Lord God of the
[43:46] Hebrews has met with us now let us go
[43:53] and we see see three days you know
[43:55] sacrificing the Lord our God now
[44:00] according to my understanding of the way
[44:04] things happens I don't know about that
[44:06] word and I can never pronounce it but
[44:08] what you call the hieroglyphics
[44:10] Herrig lippies which was the Egyptians
[44:13] writings and they wrote everything and
[44:16] kept records on their walls and drawed
[44:18] it all out and you remember in the story
[44:20] of Moses which was made up by them but
[44:24] it happened that Moses finally went back
[44:26] in there and looked on the wall and seen
[44:28] the child and knew who he was and where
[44:32] he come from because they kept records
[44:35] all of those nations kept records all
[44:39] right all of those the Egyptians note
[44:41] about the children of Israel that's my
[44:44] point
[44:45] they wouldn't if they just come up with
[44:47] a sum now he says you go to him now and
[44:50] tell them until the king he can go look
[44:53] on his wall and find out about Abraham
[44:55] Isaac and Jacob you said well you mean
[44:58] they can yeah they kept up with all of
[45:00] those things records was made the
[45:05] writing's on the walls of Egypt they're
[45:07] still there today as far as I didn't
[45:08] assume there would be whatever wasn't
[45:10] destroyed but look he's adding a point
[45:16] that whether you never thought of it or
[45:17] not I don't know but he said the Lord
[45:19] God Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph you've
[45:26] heard about these guys now let me ask
[45:29] you a simple question don't you ever
[45:32] think I mean I do every once in a while
[45:37] well you just think get a scene in your
[45:42] mind the children of Israel are down in
[45:45] Egypt
[45:46] the king is there they keep up with all
[45:52] the records and know all about it he
[45:55] walks into the king and says let my
[45:57] people go
[46:01] why didn't that King say cut his throat
[46:09] you don't think I mean a king of Egypt
[46:13] and two guys walk in Moses and Aaron
[46:17] they've done any other their own points
[46:21] yet that comes on in when they come
[46:23] walking in and says the Lord God of the
[46:30] Hebrews met with us
[46:36] why didn't I came to say here
[46:47] evidently he must have had a little bit
[46:49] of understanding somewhere right because
[46:59] that's what Moses saying he said the God
[47:03] of Abraham you heard about him hadn't
[47:05] you the King says y'all heard about the
[47:10] god of Isaac you heard about him
[47:12] yo yo are heroglyph except how you
[47:14] pronounce those big old words we got it
[47:16] on our walls what happened in these
[47:18] countries in our country and what took
[47:20] place why was that King I mean come on
[47:28] let me live in here make a story out of
[47:29] it all right sister Freda in the morning
[47:35] somebody knocks on the door and you get
[47:40] up and you lo yeah well I'm in charge of
[47:45] this whole community around here and I'm
[47:47] coming in your house and look it over
[47:51] you say no no no no no no no no no this
[47:55] is my house don't you think that King
[47:59] was sitting there thinking who is this
[48:00] guy but he had heard about him his
[48:05] granddaddy was the what was his name
[48:11] city come from get all of those names
[48:15] back there and you run them and do you
[48:17] know the guy that brought Moses up to
[48:21] thinking that Moses was his grandson I
[48:26] guess he's water you understand he knows
[48:32] all about these things get a still get
[48:35] it right or your understanding the
[48:37] Egyptians knew all about Moses and Moses
[48:46] said now you let the people go Pharaoh
[48:52] said well who don't take them out Moses
[48:54] says what I am
[48:59] you understand you don't think like that
[49:04] that king was afraid of him he knew
[49:12] about Moses and the things that had
[49:14] happened he knew about the God of
[49:16] Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[49:19] come on be sensible in your thinking
[49:32] the Lord God
[49:43] I'll put this in while we're thinking on
[49:44] it give you a time for that to float in
[49:47] it I was trying to illustrate what is
[49:53] that what is the Hebrew
[50:05] Abraham was called a Hebrew he crossed
[50:14] the river to our one day and come
[50:15] walking up he says my name is Abraham
[50:19] and the guy said that's right you're a
[50:20] Hebrew so from then on he's known as a
[50:23] Hebrew and the children of Israel known
[50:26] as Hebrews because they were descendants
[50:30] of coming down from Abraham right but
[50:35] your individual that was in bondage you
[50:36] needyou with the children of their two
[50:38] row of Hebrews coming down from Abraham
[50:49] but listen
[50:53] Abraham came from the other side the
[50:57] river are beyond as the original says he
[51:00] came from beyond
[51:03] he's a Hebrew that word Hebrew means
[51:07] that he's coming from beyond you know
[51:13] where the Bible says they were him come
[51:15] from he said I brought your father
[51:23] Abraham from the other side of the flood
[51:25] a little bit more than just saying he
[51:33] come across that River down there and
[51:34] we'll call him a Hebrew come on that's
[51:39] what the Bible says now be glad to find
[51:41] it for you so you know you can look at
[51:43] them and give it to me I can tell it if
[51:45] not then this go read your Bible and
[51:47] you'll find it it says I brought your
[51:50] father Abraham from the other side of
[51:52] the flood
[52:00] here's a little predestination to some
[52:02] of this isn't it
[52:03] right little understand in a free
[52:08] destination appears in our thoughts this
[52:12] will be in a hebrew these in that word
[52:20] Hebrew means not from one beyond our
[52:22] coming from the river over and there the
[52:25] scripture said I brought in from the
[52:26] other side the flood well there's no
[52:30] record that Abraham come over in the
[52:32] boat right they did only knowing his
[52:39] children what's he talking about the
[52:48] promised Abraham is a Hebrew the
[52:54] children of Israel Hebrews that's what
[52:58] he's talking about the Lord God of the
[53:01] Hebrews
[53:02] he's talking about the children of
[53:04] Israel that start at that moment down in
[53:05] Egypt God said I brought him the other
[53:11] side the flood how did he get over there
[53:19] he got over there from the lineages that
[53:22] come down okay this gives a little point
[53:29] let you think about it Hebrews but
[53:33] listen he keeps referring back that he's
[53:36] the Lord God the Lord God all right now
[53:46] let's go to list a hundred words we get
[53:49] to we got the eighteen
[53:56] but I want you to back up with me and
[53:59] think back up into that to verse 13 and
[54:10] bring them out so what we're gonna do
[54:12] Moses said unto God well when I come
[54:15] into the children of Israel they shall
[54:18] say unto them the god of your father's
[54:20] your Hebrews God of Abraham Isaac and
[54:24] Jacob sent me unto you they shall say to
[54:28] me what it is name what shall I say unto
[54:33] them then God said unto Moses I am that
[54:41] I am and he said thus shalt thou say
[54:46] unto the children of Israel I am hath
[54:50] sent me unto you remember where I
[54:54] Illustrated it while ago I am the God of
[54:57] Abraham I am the god of Isaac I am the
[55:01] God of Jacob I am the God of Israel I am
[55:04] the God of the Hebrews
[55:09] my name is to stay that perpetually
[55:13] throughout eternity can you find the
[55:19] name of God right there what would you
[55:23] say that I am that I am
[55:32] what about it what is his name
[55:38] well we know his name is Jesus well how
[55:43] did we learn his name with Jesus now
[55:46] listen we knew his Baptist his name was
[55:47] Jesus we had Jesus as we knew Jesus we
[55:49] knew about the name Jesus we we had
[55:51] understanding of the nine Jesus okay we
[55:54] could quote you scriptures doc I come in
[55:56] my father's name so what is the name of
[55:58] the Father Jesus so it is what is the
[56:01] name of the son Jesus but what is the
[56:07] name of God mean to you remember what I
[56:12] was illustrating Moses said I know about
[56:16] the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the
[56:18] God of Jacob the God of Israel I know
[56:20] about all of that but I ain't going
[56:23] until you give me something that is
[56:27] related to me do you see the name of
[56:34] Jesus as being related to you are you to
[56:36] see Jesus as what is the Hispanic name
[56:40] for jeshu or what is it come on y'all
[56:44] for now it's okay my brother branham
[56:48] said he said there's plenty of Jesus's
[56:52] he said that was jesus is back in that
[56:54] time but he said they wouldn't but one
[56:57] Lord Jesus Christ right wouldn't but one
[57:04] Lord Jesus Christ they wouldn't but one
[57:08] I am that I am so he advances in
[57:14] understanding of the god of a God of our
[57:18] fathers Abraham Isaac the Lord God of
[57:19] Israel and Annika as Jehovah ellingham
[57:23] now you're picking up something to get a
[57:24] little better understanding that I am
[57:28] that I am
[57:33] which means ever-present for eternity do
[57:37] you need the quotes from the Prophet
[57:40] which means ever
[57:43] present now if he is Hebrews 13:8 then
[57:49] whatever was dar is here now and
[57:52] whatever is here now will always be
[57:53] there every which way you go right
[57:59] Hebrews 13:8 shields it up
[58:02] what is Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the
[58:06] same yesterday today and forever thought
[58:11] that's what we're trying to come to an
[58:12] understanding on how to come out for the
[58:14] name Jesus when it was not pronounced
[58:18] back there there was no way to pronounce
[58:20] it
[58:22] you had to jvh you let's see the way to
[58:29] pronounce God's name is Jesus well
[58:35] that's how we know now is he something
[58:39] personal to you you get the illustration
[58:47] of what I'm saying Moses said I know
[58:49] about these I know about the I am and
[58:53] what happened in the days of Abraham
[58:57] I've read the stories of behind it or
[59:00] halted because basically what they've
[59:02] done back then was just word of mouth
[59:03] and curtain or lineage it's true it's
[59:05] like they do now there's I remember
[59:07] reading up one time about this certain
[59:09] tribe in Africa and they have people
[59:12] that all they do is they just memorize
[59:15] they memorize everyday know who's who's
[59:20] a who's who give you one a brother
[59:25] motion brother Ezra Georgia them not
[59:30] they must be downstairs or whatever but
[59:32] you know for certain that that guy had a
[59:35] brain brother mole had one but Ezra had
[59:37] a brain now brain to remember he had a
[59:40] brain to remember people and names and
[59:42] who was who and who done what and we
[59:45] were standing talking one day and he
[59:47] asked me what it was I said well we come
[59:49] down through the cranes we come over
[59:51] he said we better stop he said we're
[59:52] somewhere in the category of fifth
[59:54] cousins already
[59:56] because the heaters and that was brother
[59:59] moat knowing it yes for some of you
[1:00:01] grinnin life and you know about Ezra he
[1:00:03] he had a memory because that's what they
[1:00:07] doing back there they handed it down one
[1:00:10] to the other one generation another
[1:00:11] whereas the Egyptians wrote it on the
[1:00:13] walls and there's other than done this
[1:00:15] away another way but whatever it is they
[1:00:17] kept records see they could follow those
[1:00:20] records and the record came up to what
[1:00:25] from God in Genesis 1 Genesis 2 Lord God
[1:00:30] then Lord God coming on through and God
[1:00:33] the Lord in different things I gave it
[1:00:35] to you there the other day trying to get
[1:00:36] you to see about the name and here you
[1:00:40] come up to winding up to where Moses is
[1:00:43] standing at the burning bush and he so
[1:00:45] he knows something supernatural isn't is
[1:00:48] involved in things and he knows for
[1:00:51] certainly that takes somebody here
[1:00:53] talking to him that's different than all
[1:00:55] the others and that was the Lord God and
[1:00:58] he said I am never that's where we
[1:01:01] started reading I am spoke to Moses then
[1:01:07] Moses began to realize hey this is
[1:01:09] something great going on what's taking
[1:01:11] place I am I can remember the God of
[1:01:14] Abraham I remember the god of Isaac I
[1:01:16] remember the God of Jacob I know all
[1:01:20] about those things and I know that we
[1:01:22] are the Hebrews that we are the children
[1:01:23] of Israel and we're down here in bondage
[1:01:28] Moses knew all the whole story because
[1:01:31] he was able to read all of that you
[1:01:33] remember he was raised up a little boy
[1:01:35] in the king's palace and he knew all the
[1:01:39] whole stories oh we go to movies and
[1:01:43] they make a version of what they can do
[1:01:44] about it but when they come to that you
[1:01:46] go to the Ten Commandments and then it
[1:01:49] follows real good it makes a good layout
[1:01:51] and all but field watch it every once in
[1:01:52] a while it'll flick there's a little
[1:01:54] catch in earth that they don't exactly
[1:01:56] get
[1:01:59] I mean how did Pharaoh's daughter wind
[1:02:05] up not letting Pharaoh know all about
[1:02:08] what was going on well hey they made a
[1:02:11] picture out of it they made a movie out
[1:02:13] of it I met her this that was to sell
[1:02:15] Martin buy you know what to do forget
[1:02:17] what I'm talking about but the time you
[1:02:21] come to Moses you still have no name you
[1:02:29] don't like he's wording but that's all
[1:02:31] right
[1:02:31] you can't wind up with a guard with no
[1:02:33] name cuz you can't pronounce his name
[1:02:41] there was no way they were locked in
[1:02:46] under that basis but they had come to a
[1:02:48] place that it added to in the Moses in
[1:02:52] his account because before then it was I
[1:02:56] am I am the God of Abraham I am the god
[1:03:02] of Isaac I'm the God of Jacob I am Moses
[1:03:08] said I know all about that but tell me
[1:03:11] something personal he said I am that I
[1:03:14] am
[1:03:15] I'm dead I am I'm the one that spoke to
[1:03:20] Moses I mean to Abraham and Isaac to
[1:03:23] Jacob and all these things I am that I
[1:03:26] am you remember over in the scripture
[1:03:32] where it talks about when you say that
[1:03:35] stuff like it he said I am that voice in
[1:03:40] the wilderness you can get a lot of
[1:03:42] capital letters out of the Bible if
[1:03:44] you'll read it correctly and the right
[1:03:46] understand it but give what I'm talking
[1:03:48] about so you're adding an understanding
[1:03:57] to bring a clarity to the name so you
[1:04:00] adding what I am that I am
[1:04:10] Moses it okay
[1:04:11] I don't know what's going on but I'm
[1:04:15] going to eat you
[1:04:15] that's the best way to say cuz you think
[1:04:18] he knows all about that I don't I think
[1:04:20] he just decided about that time he said
[1:04:23] hey I know who I'm talking to
[1:04:25] I know who's talking to me and I don't
[1:04:27] know what's gonna do but he said for me
[1:04:29] to go and I'm gonna do what he says I'm
[1:04:34] going down there because if he's over
[1:04:37] here telling me what to do he's going to
[1:04:40] be down there to make sure it works
[1:04:46] right he's going to come along with me
[1:04:52] alright he gets down to pharaoh and
[1:04:55] pharaoh says huh you know they set up a
[1:04:59] point 'ln you know what I mean
[1:05:00] I mean did he just walk in the Kings
[1:05:03] walk in the palace and if moles in there
[1:05:05] and just walk in you we come and take
[1:05:07] over now I'll get the story sensible in
[1:05:10] your mind they get an appointment with
[1:05:13] Pharaoh Pharaoh says Moses I thought we
[1:05:22] got rid of that old boy doesn't know
[1:05:27] technically there's an argument over the
[1:05:28] setting that comes up second or third
[1:05:30] now if you ever read your scriptures and
[1:05:33] followed it you'll find a little little
[1:05:35] gap in there and I remember this and the
[1:05:39] Baptist Church we're studying about that
[1:05:41] Pharaoh you know they called each other
[1:05:44] called Pharaoh Pharaoh Pharaoh SETI even
[1:05:47] times they had names and you got a
[1:05:50] little argument over whether this guy is
[1:05:52] this guy or this guy this guy one of
[1:05:55] them was supposed to bend if Moses would
[1:05:58] have stayed where one of them was
[1:06:00] supposed to bend Moses his brother or at
[1:06:03] least his half-brother or whatever you
[1:06:06] want to call him some of them guys died
[1:06:08] off because it took quite a ha you've
[1:06:11] got Moses for 40 years out there and you
[1:06:15] got in 40 years and already come over
[1:06:16] here so he's 80 years old how old was
[1:06:18] that other guy and then this goes out
[1:06:22] and back I'm just saying it that way
[1:06:24] this leaving the point where
[1:06:25] you see we think we know all about it we
[1:06:28] don't study the story but set to ever
[1:06:34] what his name is that faces Moses wasn't
[1:06:37] Pharaoh because that was only I was his
[1:06:39] granddaddy but he'd have been glad to
[1:06:44] see Moses come back we just remember as
[1:06:48] Moses had studied those walls and led
[1:06:51] read those hieroglyphics
[1:06:54] so had Pharaoh and so had settee
[1:06:57] and so did all of them know what was
[1:07:01] going on
[1:07:02] and here comes up Moses said - he says
[1:07:08] hmm I thought we got rid of this little
[1:07:12] boy I thought we've run him out into the
[1:07:16] wilderness I better walk a little soft
[1:07:21] today you remember what the trouble was
[1:07:24] were the two SETI and Moses you know
[1:07:27] what I mean this user network said - he
[1:07:29] ever what the name comes up to be you
[1:07:31] know what it was that guy wanted to be
[1:07:33] in charge of Israel I'm in of Egypt but
[1:07:36] he wasn't because granddaddy had already
[1:07:38] made up his mind to make Moses the guy
[1:07:41] in charge right
[1:07:44] Moses was already in in charge called
[1:07:47] Moses was the one that conquered Moses
[1:07:50] wanted led to people they were afraid of
[1:07:54] that said he was afraid of Moses
[1:07:56] bringing an insurrection to when Moses
[1:08:00] comes walking back in the guy said who
[1:08:03] you say that Moses and says he's got a
[1:08:07] guy with him called his prophets that
[1:08:08] he's Aaron but didn't sit he just say
[1:08:15] boys do your job go get rid of them
[1:08:25] that was afraid of him hey this guy
[1:08:29] caused trouble before we better walk
[1:08:30] soft so Pharaoh says okay tell them come
[1:08:34] on in you know sit here what isn't I
[1:08:36] wonder don't come over there and Moses
[1:08:41] could stand there and look at him and
[1:08:43] say listen you studied in hieroglyphics
[1:08:46] as well a tire
[1:08:48] you know what took place he said I don't
[1:08:54] believe you you may not believe me but
[1:08:56] you know you know there's writing on
[1:08:59] them walls that declared it was a man
[1:09:01] come up here and what he was to do and
[1:09:07] said you had the children killed you're
[1:09:08] your daddy or a granddaddy which one it
[1:09:11] was
[1:09:11] said you had the children kill from two
[1:09:14] years of age and under to try to get rid
[1:09:17] of that Moses well you didn't get rid of
[1:09:20] him I'm here now what are you going to
[1:09:27] all I'm asking you is one thing let my
[1:09:30] people go and really it was a little bit
[1:09:35] deceiving when he first said because the
[1:09:37] first encounter was with said he was
[1:09:40] from Moses and said let us go three days
[1:09:42] out in the wilderness and worship garden
[1:09:43] we'll come back they went in didn't come
[1:09:46] back but I guess he was just human no
[1:09:53] why didn't have said he said okay that's
[1:09:55] taken going out there because God had
[1:09:59] already hardened that man's heart that
[1:10:02] there was no way that that man was gonna
[1:10:04] let him get away he had let him go ahead
[1:10:07] and let him get away back before then
[1:10:09] but he wasn't gonna do it now
[1:10:14] you understand but to Moses they had
[1:10:19] been added I am that I am
[1:10:25] Moses tender and says I'll go because I
[1:10:28] know about the I am and he says that I
[1:10:32] am I've got something more sure now but
[1:10:35] that's still not his name that's not his
[1:10:39] name
[1:10:41] it still titles to a name more
[1:10:48] understanding more of the story but not
[1:10:55] know add at night cuz still ain't got a
[1:10:58] night I am that I am that's still don't
[1:11:01] name we still JV h dr j vh you we're
[1:11:09] still hung you got a fast time between
[1:11:18] Moses and the coming of Jesus Christ
[1:11:20] upon the earth to where that he would
[1:11:21] come forth as being the Lord Jesus
[1:11:27] Christ
[1:11:31] you still need a night that's what gets
[1:11:37] me I'm sorry but it gets me of all the
[1:11:41] people of this message because they
[1:11:43] they've been at it ever since we've been
[1:11:44] in the message 50 years what do you know
[1:11:48] the new name of Jesus you know the new
[1:11:53] name of Jesus you can take over you can
[1:11:54] do I hadn't done away with a name yet
[1:11:57] I ain't got that finished yet I ain't
[1:11:59] even got to his name yet rah I'm still
[1:12:02] don't titles I've still got much by that
[1:12:06] somewhere around two to three thousand
[1:12:08] years before that can come into being
[1:12:12] about the name of Jesus
[1:12:19] they only mentioned I don't mean only
[1:12:21] but one of their only mentions of him
[1:12:24] through there between Moses and coming
[1:12:26] forth and coming up to Israel is in what
[1:12:29] is it Isaiah where he's talking about
[1:12:31] and I shall call his name Emmanuel what
[1:12:38] didn't they call his name that they were
[1:12:40] told over there any angel I'll get to if
[1:12:42] I don't know get it next time they get
[1:12:44] to that an angel told Mary called his
[1:12:47] name Jesus but he'd been told the
[1:12:52] fulfillment of the scripture would have
[1:12:54] been to call his name Emmanuel because
[1:12:57] the scripture had told him in there and
[1:12:59] is in Isaiah where he says his name
[1:13:02] shall be Emmanuel God with us
[1:13:08] so you still not know named Emmanuelle's
[1:13:11] not an item because it's not related to
[1:13:14] a person remember you got to have a
[1:13:16] person for a name to be important they
[1:13:21] say the most wonderful the words that
[1:13:23] anyone can ever hear is their name being
[1:13:25] called because it has a relation to the
[1:13:29] body of the human part of you thinking
[1:13:31] and you're standing in a crowd and on
[1:13:34] understanding and I say Tony don't you
[1:13:42] well because that's his name he knows
[1:13:47] his name and he knows I'm calling his
[1:13:49] name and if he knows my voice he knows
[1:13:51] especially as I'm calling his night he's
[1:13:54] looking for me to be calling all over
[1:13:55] the building to get all kind of Kony's
[1:14:02] but listen
[1:14:04] just getting a little dollop his name
[1:14:13] shall be called Emmanuel alright now
[1:14:20] we're getting just a little further you
[1:14:22] come over over into the new testament
[1:14:24] and iris marry and you get her down at
[1:14:28] the water pot that day and an angel
[1:14:30] appears into her there's Mary said
[1:14:36] you're chosen and said you've read the
[1:14:45] story get it all read it all read it in
[1:14:47] your understanding Mary
[1:14:49] it wasn't married you marry you haven't
[1:14:52] yet not know get the whole story Mary
[1:14:59] you've been chosen you've been chosen of
[1:15:05] all of the women of the world to do a
[1:15:09] specific job she talks with the angel
[1:15:15] maybe four hours discussing the matter
[1:15:19] we think he's different
[1:15:22] no she knew the whole story and she was
[1:15:28] told said you'll call his name Emmanuel
[1:15:34] no you call his name Jesus yes you can
[1:15:38] still use the manual because she knows
[1:15:41] what it means Emmanuelle they knew what
[1:15:42] he Manuel meant they could read Isaiah
[1:15:44] that his name would be Emmanuel you
[1:15:46] could say what will be that what will be
[1:15:48] the Messiah that will become one of
[1:15:51] these days and as you would quickly say
[1:15:54] his name shall be Emmanuel we see when
[1:16:01] it came forth it didn't come forth his
[1:16:03] name it would remain you well you come
[1:16:05] forth telling you that his name shall be
[1:16:06] called Emmanuel
[1:16:07] but the real waiter said is Jesus how do
[1:16:10] you pronounce the Emmanuel Jes us Jesus
[1:16:16] you'll call his name Jesus because he'll
[1:16:20] save now watch it not just any Jesus not
[1:16:23] just any person out there with the name
[1:16:25] Jesus because it gives us specifics to
[1:16:27] what it says because he'll be them a
[1:16:29] savior of his people
[1:16:32] right you've called his name Jesus
[1:16:34] because he'll be the savior he'll be the
[1:16:37] Redeemer he'll be the one his name is
[1:16:40] Jesus
[1:16:43] now you remember what I've asked you to
[1:16:45] are the other day for you to look it up
[1:16:46] and see they capitalized those the
[1:16:53] letter Jesus when I was talking about it
[1:16:55] in Matthew they bold it when they put
[1:16:58] Jesus after it had been directed what to
[1:17:04] do and they used his name twice there
[1:17:09] and they bold or italicized it read what
[1:17:11] you want to call it upper cases whatever
[1:17:14] you want to bring it and you'll call his
[1:17:17] name Jesus brother Brennan said the
[1:17:21] first time spoken by a human being a
[1:17:26] baby comes to life read your story first
[1:17:29] time spoken by human being was to a
[1:17:31] human being about a human being you'll
[1:17:35] call his name Jesus John didn't even
[1:17:40] because that was the angel talking so
[1:17:45] Mary goes and she leaves and runs over
[1:17:48] to her Elizabeth her kin folks you know
[1:17:51] and Elizabeth had been pregnant for
[1:17:55] about six months you know but baby was
[1:17:57] now removed or nothing Mary goes in and
[1:18:02] she says you know Hail Mary and as you
[1:18:05] greet her you know salutations army and
[1:18:08] they get through and they talking in and
[1:18:11] Elizabeth said Mary I'm worried that dog
[1:18:17] I know I'm pregnant but said the baby
[1:18:21] hasn't moved it's about six months
[1:18:26] that's not right
[1:18:28] and that mood very says well I'm
[1:18:34] expecting a child to Liz but oh you and
[1:18:36] Joseph got married Noah didn't you know
[1:18:39] the problems right Elizabeth said oh
[1:18:43] come on now say something going wrong
[1:18:45] here because you mean you're pregnant
[1:18:48] and you ain't married new is what's
[1:18:49] going on she gives the Bible calls it
[1:18:54] her salutation she said the angel of the
[1:18:57] Lord met me and said I would be found
[1:19:02] with a child of the Holy Ghost that
[1:19:06] child shall be his name shall be
[1:19:09] Emmanuel God with us
[1:19:13] to fulfil isin hell we said I was told
[1:19:16] by the angel to call his name Jesus
[1:19:23] right there was a human being speaking
[1:19:26] that word first the prophets right the
[1:19:30] others of the angels talking and
[1:19:31] descriptions are this to do with that
[1:19:33] and this goes with that we hear a person
[1:19:35] called the name Jesus John leaps in the
[1:19:41] moon comes alive now you've got the name
[1:19:52] now you've went from I am the creator I
[1:19:59] am the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I
[1:20:02] am all of these things
[1:20:06] my name is i am that i am no I ain't got
[1:20:12] time to finish that I'll take it next
[1:20:13] week with it go we're gonna get into me
[1:20:16] and you oh you remember me I'm just that
[1:20:21] away everything I've got and it relates
[1:20:24] to me and you okay
[1:20:27] so just hold on but just get the point
[1:20:34] his name is Jesus
[1:20:39] No was told over there was Simeon you
[1:20:45] called his name Jesus notice that you're
[1:20:50] reading all of those things in relating
[1:20:52] to Jesus it allows some references like
[1:20:55] I said it'll say something like who will
[1:20:57] save his people who will give his life
[1:21:00] for his people and every time the name
[1:21:02] is Jesus is mentioned a little baby
[1:21:11] Jehovah crying in a cradle Jehovah with
[1:21:19] no teeth now I'm quoting brother Branham
[1:21:21] right that you hope with the Old
[1:21:25] Testament is now known that's what the
[1:21:27] Jesus of the new now we can come back to
[1:21:31] what they will end it on this thought we
[1:21:33] would come back to Hebrews 13:8 there's
[1:21:39] never been but one person in the world
[1:21:41] could ever Akkad I'll ever be to that
[1:21:43] title it was a title but it had a name
[1:21:45] replied what Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ
[1:21:55] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:22:01] fulfillment of all the scriptures
[1:22:06] anything that'll ever be in the future
[1:22:08] will have to come from that come on or
[1:22:15] else you're wrong because when he told
[1:22:19] him to say I am that I am he said that
[1:22:22] will be my name for eternity I am mean
[1:22:27] self-existing and says whatever his name
[1:22:29] is it will stay that away he said yeah
[1:22:34] but brother Dale wait a minute now
[1:22:36] you're running I'm not running off you
[1:22:42] say well well we don't know the new name
[1:22:44] brother Branham was looking for a new
[1:22:45] name great so am i but I've also found
[1:22:49] where he said this
[1:22:51] he said maybe it'll be made known when
[1:22:53] we get there okay
[1:22:58] because what's going to happen somebody
[1:23:00] comes in here let's get her at
[1:23:02] illustration according to the Bible if a
[1:23:07] prophet gives a sign and it comes to
[1:23:09] pass you're supposed to believe that
[1:23:10] prophet right the Bible also says if a
[1:23:14] prophet comes and speaks it come on what
[1:23:22] is it if a prophet give us signing it
[1:23:24] come to fight but what about the one
[1:23:26] word if a prophet comes among you and
[1:23:30] gives a sign and it comes to Pais what
[1:23:38] are you to do and God says I sent him
[1:23:45] among you to try you to see whether or
[1:23:47] not you're gonna stay with the word is
[1:23:49] that true come on you in the scriptures
[1:23:51] you know what I'm talking about
[1:23:53] God sent are allowed to come an
[1:23:57] antichrist and their life's data to
[1:23:58] deceive the biggest portion of the world
[1:24:04] he permitted it to happen he didn't make
[1:24:07] it happen he permitted it to come into
[1:24:09] being he permits a prophet to give you a
[1:24:13] false shine as an antichrist what if he
[1:24:15] was standing here and they would come
[1:24:16] rolling our dead body in right here
[1:24:18] they've been dead proven for so long and
[1:24:21] then he said I'm gonna prove to you that
[1:24:23] I'm right he's gonna raise from the dead
[1:24:27] you reach over and he raises from the
[1:24:30] dead what are you gonna do but the Bible
[1:24:35] said if he takes you to another God if
[1:24:39] he takes you to another God or another
[1:24:43] doctrine or another idea or another
[1:24:45] faith that's why I can't be looking for
[1:24:47] another prophet to come I have no hope
[1:24:50] whatsoever never based it on anything of
[1:24:52] another prophet to come to take over
[1:24:54] it's always been the way he is run
[1:24:56] around and brought the message
[1:24:58] we believe his message we stay with that
[1:25:00] and we walk in the light of the word in
[1:25:03] the hour that we're living but now we're
[1:25:06] learning that his name is Jesus because
[1:25:10] he will save his people from their sins
[1:25:15] but I don't I don't like you using them
[1:25:17] prophets like it you don't like me using
[1:25:19] the Bible did I use the Bible the Bible
[1:25:21] says if a prophet give you a son and it
[1:25:23] come to vice you got to believe that
[1:25:25] prophet but then he said if a prophet
[1:25:27] come gives you a sign and it comes to
[1:25:29] PI's but he leads you to another God
[1:25:31] don't follow him
[1:25:32] there's your Antichrist look at the
[1:25:36] people of this message the way they're
[1:25:37] doing now when we come 50 years from the
[1:25:44] to souls to Lords Peruzzi is Parthia
[1:25:50] all kind of river Jordan all kind of
[1:25:52] doctrines that the people of this
[1:25:55] message you're running a hog wild after
[1:25:57] and going off and leaving the name of
[1:25:59] Jesus you think this thing is doing now
[1:26:08] I told you when this started this is
[1:26:12] only the day of the temptations to work
[1:26:15] that it'll be through you volunteering
[1:26:17] for what's taking place be careful what
[1:26:19] you volunteer now because we're in the
[1:26:27] last days but you see you understand
[1:26:33] what I'm talking about Moses could not
[1:26:36] pronounce that name Jesus
[1:26:38] they couldn't pronounce it it couldn't
[1:26:41] be pronounced it couldn't be understood
[1:26:42] it's not what I mean pronounced they
[1:26:45] could help they could make a stab at it
[1:26:46] and call him Jesus you understand what
[1:26:49] I'm getting at it it's not to just
[1:26:51] pronounce it it's to understand it
[1:26:59] I hope you fathered me of what I was
[1:27:04] saying because we if your doctrine will
[1:27:06] come out because remember Hebrews 13:8
[1:27:09] has gotta something in it okay you mind
[1:27:13] if I read it just see if I can find it
[1:27:23] okay
[1:27:37] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:27:40] and forever
[1:27:42] but what's verse 7 that's verse 8 if you
[1:27:49] can brothers pull up Hebrews 13:7 easy
[1:27:55] to get 13:8 do that and roll it
[1:27:58] backwards can you get it ok I'll just go
[1:28:07] ahead and maybe they'll pick it up
[1:28:08] Hebrews 13:7 says remember them which
[1:28:11] have the rule over you who have spoken
[1:28:14] unto you the Word of God whose faith
[1:28:18] follow considering the end of their
[1:28:21] conversation what is the end of a
[1:28:24] person's conversation Jesus Christ the
[1:28:27] same yesterday today and forever right
[1:28:32] remember them which how the rule over
[1:28:35] you who have spoken unto you the Word of
[1:28:37] God whose faith follow considering the
[1:28:40] end of their conversation
[1:28:42] what is the end of your conversation if
[1:28:46] it leads you to a false god or a false
[1:28:49] doctrine it is not Hebrews 13:8 if you
[1:28:52] understand what I'm trying my best to
[1:28:54] bring I had it written in here to bring
[1:28:56] it over and over when it comes forth
[1:28:58] what I am that's Hebrews 13:8 when it
[1:29:01] come forth with I am that I am that's
[1:29:03] Hebrews 13:8 when it come forth with his
[1:29:05] name Emmanuel that's Hebrews 13:8 when
[1:29:08] it comes forth to the name is Jesus
[1:29:09] that's Hebrews 13:8 the book of Acts
[1:29:19] 7:35 or something in there you realize
[1:29:23] it says Jesus was the angel that spoke
[1:29:27] to Moses from the burning bush are you
[1:29:33] with me you have read that Jesus is the
[1:29:37] angel that spoke to Moses from the
[1:29:42] burning bush can we get that let me see
[1:29:46] if I can find it all right come on
[1:29:47] musician well I'm picking up something
[1:29:49] come on
[1:29:53] did you get
[1:30:07] where every number number nine brothers
[1:30:12] in Murray's belief what is it what is
[1:30:15] the pillar of fire it's the angel of the
[1:30:18] Lord
[1:30:18] what is the angel of the Lord the same
[1:30:21] was one was in the burning bush the same
[1:30:24] one that was in Jesus Christ the same
[1:30:29] one that's in you tonight is the same
[1:30:35] one that was in the burning bush the
[1:30:38] same one here the same great Lord Jesus
[1:30:46] both the paradox
[1:30:48] he says angel of the Lord pillar of fire
[1:30:50] led the children of Israel through the
[1:30:52] wilderness that was a paradox that
[1:30:53] talked to Moses there in the burning
[1:30:56] bush that was a paradox and he goes down
[1:30:57] to explain what it was in a journey all
[1:30:59] day that here Jesus said before Abraham
[1:31:02] was I am
[1:31:03] I am was in the burning bush I am was
[1:31:07] the one that talked to Moses the Lord
[1:31:12] Jesus spoke to Moses from the burning
[1:31:15] bush the Prophet in the last days
[1:31:22] recognized who was speaking the Lord
[1:31:25] Jesus right come on let's tan Bank on
[1:31:30] these things can you see his name there
[1:31:38] not another nine given whereby men must
[1:31:40] be saved or can be say in the name of
[1:31:44] Jesus right they couldn't pronounce it
[1:31:50] back there they couldn't pronounce jvh
[1:31:52] you but we can call now we know what it
[1:31:55] is his name is Jesus but he had to come
[1:32:00] into human flesh the angels had to speak
[1:32:06] those things to bring it forth and
[1:32:08] clarity before the name could be
[1:32:11] pronounced on earth and human beings
[1:32:13] it's not just Jesus because that can be
[1:32:17] any named of Spanish or whatever you
[1:32:19] want
[1:32:20] but if Lord Jesus Christ the God of
[1:32:24] Abraham Isaac and Jacob I am that I am
