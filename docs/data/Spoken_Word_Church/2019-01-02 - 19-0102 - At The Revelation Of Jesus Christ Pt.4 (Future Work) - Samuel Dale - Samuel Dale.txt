time at the what's not service and really enjoyed the times in the fellowship that we had and all all that it turned out real good and I pray that you know that you enjoyed it and we're starting a brand new year so that's that's a wonderful thing you know time is is running out but you know the Prophet said everything is right on time everything so there's nothing out of cater nothing's wrong everything's are you said well what are we doing here we're at well for some reason we're here so then we just find that reason and move on and this keep going in and all things so you meant it's a revelation 1st Peter 1 and revelations 1 father we thank you for the night and your love thank you for your grace and your kindness thank you for you Lord and we pray that you would just bless us now as we read your word you come on the scene now and speak to our hearts and Lord let that word become alive to each one of us father we pray that you'd be with the sick ones that are among us and just

remember now the Bible study is coming Saturday six o'clock and with that be much in prayer for brother Lewis and the family cuz I think we've got a couple of dates on there that one of them was listed as afford another this is a seventh so it was on the board for the seventh but anyhow we pray that the Lord would just just keep praying environment they'd be safe coming back and being with us and you know like that so remember that and remember the fellowship meeting will be here on the third Saturday which will be the 19th 3:30 and afternoon brother Forney will be ministering for us on that fellowship meetings that we write to Lord where we take all of these things remember all of the announcements and things that are made we keep making them and then you'd be surprised how many people come along and say well I didn't hear that made well we try to make them over and over and over you know and so maybe it'll sink in some work what remember the Easter banquet time or what you called it Valentine time remember that and just get all of that together you know all right verse seven that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that purchased though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen you love in him go now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your set faith even the salvation of your souls which salvation the prophets have inquired and desired diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching water what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should be should follow under whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ let's go over to revelations 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy what about blessing - just to get to hear it and to read it huh and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word then we we were in our life service when we were taken we were trying to talk a little bit about the writing of the Bible and we'll try to pull that the end and then move up and some to help us to understand the coast to me if we're going to believe the Bible has to be that what we teach it as to be you know the revelation of Jesus Christ right so then it's not trying to find necessarily a mystery you know something that maybe we look at it oh oh that's a mystery that's a mystery the entire Bible is a mystery Wow and it has to be revealed all right so then it's and in that doing then it's a writing of the Word of God our God's Way of bringing to you and I his understanding throughout the entire Bible and we talk about Hebrews 13:8 you know as to be in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever well then that would be back in the Old Testament as well as the new and that's why we read that scripture of were that even the Apostles and things they desire to look into these things and they saw certain things they saw something was happening you know and they could follow it to a degree all right and truly it was a mystery but yet there was a lot of those things that was brought into their understanding and then opened up to word that people could see the things that was taking place and know for sure 'ti something was happening you know it wasn't just that that they were saying oh yeah well okay well I said I enjoyed that you know I think now something was happening and that's what I've tried my best to make the emphasis to each one of us to where we can follow it that in the writing of the Bible no matter where it be old New Testament or whatever it is it's the writing of about the revelation of God to man alright so then that would be the revelation of Jesus Christ the Prophet says if you don't see Christ in reverse go back to read it again all right cause it's dire in the word all right and then doing that then it turned out to be a wonderful thing because we we got up to this point kind of and we'll emphasize a little of it and then move on that you know in the writing of the Bible you've got things that how do you state that you you got things that are written in the Bible that was already passed already happened before it was ever written down when I see like Genesis you know and Moses and the things like that that you've got those things that were there already made manifest you know alive all right then it was pinned down and it becomes the Bible within that away see you're not trying to as I said find some mysterious secret coding of something because man has done that all the time he tries to find a code or something that's there that would tell him this and he can see this and you know through the codes that are there in the Bible and all that's well and good but I never did understand it but I like it this way because this is kind of the life stops and we'll pick up a little bit here from it as I said then the Bible in the writing that some of it had been made manifest a long time you know already happened realities etc before that it was pinned down okay all right now so then you would have if we talk about Hebrews 13:8 PI's present future okay and so you've got like Moses etc the things like that is written as to something that was in his writing of Genesis all of that had done transpired over if you try to calculate the time it would be on over a couple of thousand years at least you know before the accounts were written and all all right but that was still making Hebrews 13:8 because he would be the same now when it would come to the point now this was my point of driving if you could take the part of say Moses and the writing of the book and the writing of it after it's done taking place a long time you know and who would how would he know what happened to Genesis you know those things but he knew it by revelation alright see then that would be paced okay then Moses would come on the scene and you know live out his life and he would write the things of that well that would bring that the way I think about see that would bring that to present tense because now he's writing all of the Pais when he starts writing the the points and you don't do it some of that he was living what he was talking about all right so you got Pais you got something present and then he wrote of the future to come all right and see that would be the same theme for the entire Bible all right that was my point of trying to get it see truth in you and how Hebrews 13:8 they didn't be the same yesterday today and forever that would bring it out to a perfect point all right we talked about you know the Bible showing us some things that has been and it's those things that has taken place and then it shows the future all right but now here's where we try to pick up our thought but remember the one point that I tried to emphasize to us on the last message that we need to see or understand that it's not now listen it's not the Word of God until it's made alive all right now that was the last point we were dealing with you say yes the Word of God is wrote down that's God's Word yeah but now you're you're you you've got a problem because some of that if you're looking at has already happened and some of it is happening and some of it is to come so you're you're you're losing out on the point of what we're trying to get see to me when the word is made alive now you're talking about God's Word now you're talking about the written Bible all right to when things are made alive they not just are made manifest not just talking not just writing letters all right but when that that was written becomes a reality it was written see that the children of Israel would be 400 years and we know they went 34 more but it was written in what we would call the Bible that they would be in Egypt for 400 years all right but when they come forth to live what was written or when that becomes to a present tense form you know right while they were living 30 years was added because of the transgression right all right so then when you were coming to the alive word in other words when you come down to that that was written as it's being made alive you see in that that mankind begin to not understand he began to fail on his comprehension of what God was trying to do and as he did even God had to add time to him to make it work out all right what's he then when that was finished now you know and they become alive and the children of Israel comes down and they're leaving out of Egypt they're going they're fulfilling what the Bible had said are the words the letters the prophets had written about it they begin to fulfill that so it began to get to a personal point all right something made into reality or alive okay then it would speak of the future our prophecy our see it would be a prophecy you know like when you'd get on over the New Testament Paul saying I think you know this be changed the moment we live and I etc see then he's prophesying of something to come that is not in total reality right there at that time so you're following in that what see the entire Bible is written that away so Moses would come on the scene and then he would write of what had been then he would write of what is our present tense huh and then he would write even in the future to come so the same thing Apollo that's what that's why that it's it's a wonderful thing to me to read the Bible and look at it and and look at it and say well you know that's already been fulfilled but then look at it and steady it and read some other so yeah but now there's some of it's not been fulfilled now do you think that's gonna come to pies I sure hope you think it's going to be if it is the Word of God it's going to be come into a reality all right so you get what I'm talking about now the Bible is the entire and the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ me whether it be of the past present or future all right now it is necessary and listen to my point now Moses wrote pinned you know the Bible but now when he pinned the Bible it was necessary that someone come on the scene and live what he had written are you following me see now you're getting to the alive word you getting to the reality of things to her that you're looking at it in the right order see the Bible is not only the written letter it's the living word made alive this Bible has been made alive by mankind now there are things in here that will get on this we're covering more later that hasn't taken place yet all right now that is the letter written right but that's not the alive word follow the point that was my emphasis all the way through trying to get it to that one thing that we look at the Bible as to be letters on the page instead of looking at it as being people that were actually living it you know actually making it alive when when it was written that the children of Israel would be down there for so many you know 400 all right but see then it was written back there that they would go out with a strong hand all right so Moses writing of what is to be and how to get and then he's speaking of a prophecy to bring it to the future all right but now once he speaks of it to the future see then he must back up I don't know maybe not the correct way to presenting it but just try to get the point he backs up to live what he wrote okay now coach don't you believe that someday somebody is going to be changed in a moment between you and I right come see if they didn't if it does not happen then Paul would be wrong and that wouldn't be the written word of God that would be letters that could be questioned all right Missy I believe in a reality of a living God a living people are people to make alive rather brown call it the the outer descent the young the fact of these letters on the page made alive into our hearts he said then it becomes a reality all right alive all right but now until someone comes to change in a moment wink of an eye that is still prophecy and let me quote the Prophet he said long just letting I like that what he say it can be questioned but he said once it's made alive he said it can't be questioned the more he said now when the Bible would speak and say a virgin shall conceive he said but one day that became a reality you know a living word all right now so then we're not talking about the Bible to me is not just letters on the page you know this message that the Prophet brought is just not letter letters on the page or on the tape or whatever there's things the Prophet spoke that we've seen come to Pais but there's things that he spoke has not come to pies and see then we have to sometimes wait on that to be made into a reality but it's blitt the believers in the Bible is the Word of God all right now follow the point now so what's what's what we're getting to now so then second Corinthians three and two says you are our epistles written in our heart known and read of all man that's really emphasized just a little bit more than what we do in doing because most of the time would you say you are written epistles or we are written epistles but see actually to me it's saying you are our epistles written in our heart see then that way it can be read of all men in you now here's the point we'll try to pick up which is the greatest to think of is that we have the Bible you know thank God you know praise God we've got the Bible but which do you think is greater of having the letters of the page no now listen to the point and the letters of the page that a lot of that's already happened and proved to be true but see this message takes it into a deeper form because this message takes it to a living reality all right then which one do you want letters on the page we've had that the Prophet said as long as it lays there it could be questioned oh no no it can't well that's what he said it so you know but once it's made alive he said it can't be questioned all right see though so that was a day then the children of Israel had to leave Egypt to fulfill what Moses had written you know see then it could become a living reality are you are you Father which one you draw the house with brother dad I want to Bible now to me I'm hope I'm not dumb a little stupid and all like that but not totally but to me I'm not talking about mistakes and things that happen but rather made mistakes but random talk things he had to correct all right now but there's nothing in the Bible my father there's nothing in the ladder that would be wrong now we had the wrong cause we had the wrong interpretations we had you know all of that but there's nothing wrong with the written letter of the word come on your prophet said it what he said we have what the divine to see the divine interpretation with revelation how did he say that it's it's something in other words what he's saying to me he's saying I'd rather have the alive word than the how the letters on the page because the letters on the page can be questioned all right but once it comes into your heart it can't be now may I Ella straight it like this we used to read Matthew 28:19 right now you didn't say what we felt it said but we thought it said right we thought it said that we thought it said Father Son and Holy Ghost now we know it didn't do that but now get the point of what I'm saying letters on the page says Father Son and Holy Ghost but a revelation says Lord Jesus Christ then which one you drew the house well I'll just take about within come on come on you're not thinking with me the way come on try to think the way I think sometimes that's crazy I guess but see we we took the Bible and proved three gods read the Bible people are still doing that today around the world they're reading the Bible and still teaching the Trinity they're reading the Bible and baptizing in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost but that's not the Bible as letters on the page that we've translated to mean what we want it to mean because the Bible never said Father Son and Holy Ghost he says in the name of the father not names it never said what we thought it was saying so now which one do you want you know people of this message that's what they'll do a lot of time you see them come along you know and they'll follow the message your wallet and you'll see them dump one way or the other and they'll go one form of the other they'll either go back to to their old denominational ideas and thoughts are either you know and do away with the we don't believe the message we believe the Bible all right or either they'll say we we believe the message and don't believe the Bible you know you know what I'm talking about true you see how could you have that this message is either the Word of God made into a reality taken off of the letters of the page and brought into our hearts by revelation or either we've missed it now come on see people could argue with you when you believe in a Trinity because see you couldn't argue back you know I did my brother he taught a Trinity and CI that's a good old Baptists out of one God let's eat come to find it out I was just much Trinitarian as he was but I didn't see it that way because I didn't believe in three guards my point is this and they take away from you your baptism let me just ask you that can mankind take your baptism away from you you know what I'm talking about can they take it and make it go back to Father Son and Holy Ghost why why is it they can't do it because they are theological they have their points they have the emphases and they gain ground every day on how to present it how come they can't do that because it's been a made alive in your heart but it's been made alive that Lord Jesus Christ is the correct way cause if not you just arguing you're fussing through the people but when it's revealed it solves it well look at all the emphases all the things that are done and putting it you know that brother Branham is this and he was so wrong and this was wrong you know he was that and look at all of the great things that are happening but you see Church I told them they were arguing in the seventies about the dates and the situations and things being wrong the brother around him and his huntin and thought and I told him then I said look do not argue with a man you're arguing of whether or not the Word of God is real you realize that if you're gonna take the emphasis well brother Brennan said if you catch me wrong in one place that I'm wrong all the way well that's how I was a problem code I can take there in a hurry I can show you one where he said he was wrong now what are you gonna do see you're gonna say well I see that he's gonna just do like just tore it down and quit well then what are you gonna do when they come along with something else and try to give it to you were you gonna throw that down how long's it gonna take you to run that out let's see I told him in I said I don't care what you prove that brother branham was wrong here rather random was wrong dire I said he's led me to the Lord Jesus Christ and see then I don't worry about what it was right or wrong humanly yeah a lot of wrong yeah but revelation wise ain't no wrong to it there's no problems with the message there are no no mistakes in the message another messenger he made mistake we know that but then when he would come back and correct that mistake then show the truth of what it was getting it from past letters on the page to present tense to seeing it happening now and going on into the future with what you're looking at then you can follow it in the correct line and the Prophet said the people was the written Bible that's the written Bible made it live it's not just letters on a page see we look at it still there's a written Bible we call it letters or a painting no I'm not talking about that I'm talking about to the point that it's real and they can't take it away from you well I've got some problems I just don't understand this donor well coming let's talk about it go see either the message is right or wrong it's either right or wrong well I mean you know well let's sit down and discuss what what it is but let's don't get into our silly little you know thoughts of our own selves and what we're doing letters on the page will kill us look at the people that quote quote quote quote quote quote well you know brother runs message all the way down through there and then look at them now but now think about it cuz this is what I want you to look at go ahead a number one we'll pull up will start you know I doubt we get through tonight I want to bring but anyhow the seed of discrepancy he's bringing out a point for thoughts uh come down through the middle now back the other way where we started let's see we'll start right here save reading he was listen he was the interpretation of the word that time what Jesus Christ are talking about coming down and riders and even to the prophets and think they were the interpretation of the Word of God alright now look he was the interpretation of the word of God and ever born again son and daughter of God of this age is the interpretation of the word you are written epistles read of all men yes what about being the interpretation Jesus Christ was the interpretation of the Word of God right in other words the word interpreting her brought her alive he made it alive all right then he would say what he'd say show me were that I'm off the word my words tell me where I'm missing the word where I'm not fulfilling the word to the letter I'm fulfilling what was said about me he said because he was the interpretation of the word but think about yourself and you'll understand what I said a moment ago when they can't take away from you the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if it's revealed to you if not you'll drop it and run off and take something out something but if it's revealed they can't do it cause why because you become the interpretation if we believe in one true and living God if we believe that we are the children of God then we're the interpretation now think about it the interpretation of the word you don't think like that well no we we can't interpret it go ahead play your silly games you're not listening or thinking this message brought alive the God that I believed in sure I couldn't explain it sure I didn't know how sure I was just as much carnality and in all like that an understanding is mankind could be what takes one thing about it this message is brought Christ to me what's it done to you I'm telling this message we said well the Bible brought me to Christ yeah brother used to tell me say well you know I've got to see God in me he's before I could see God in Jesus I said you're exactly backwards I said that's totally backwards listen you got to see God in Christ and then and only then can it be revealed that he's in you because what's in you is not Christ then if it's not revealed it's not Christ I mean you can quote all you want to Christ in you the hope of glory nice letters on the page I quoted that as a Trinitarian once you quote well you just see there I know but what about a an understanding that would label it down and bring it to a purity in our hearts and our lives until the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it now that's that's what I'm talking about because that's what Jesus said it would right he said upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell he said can't prevail against it now he said they'll be against it but they can't overcome it in other words if they took your Bible away from you you know just took their Bibles away some way they could make them all disappear what would you do could you live off of what you've got in your heart or would you still try to find some letter from what I'm talking about writing of the Bible or a Bible that is written that man can read now listen to what I'm getting at so it's impossible no think it's impossible to read the letter of the word and keep it correct no okay you're not listening it's impossible to read the letter of the word and keep it straight but now with Christ in you then the letter you see that it doesn't need anything to make it straight it's automatically straight it's real so you're getting what I'm talking about well brother Dale I've got to have the work that's right a man but what if they take all that away from you in other words if they took her Bibles and things away wouldn't it be able to persuade us to go back where we came from and believe what we used to believe mm a little more to it than what we think all right whatever son and daughter of God of this age is the interpretation of the word that's why you can't be taken from you see the gates of Hell can't prevail no so then when we brought that point in the last message we were sitting at revelations one one and one through three and coming forth and trying to get a picture into our minds and what was it the Prophet said there he said God said before I cover anything you remember that quote before I cover anything about this or whatever he said I want you to know who I am ain't that something before I tell you about any of these things I want you to know who I am ah now then too if we take another step and we look at the Book of Revelations that it starts off we'll get back to these in another message or so but looking at the revelation of God's Word and knowing that if the Prophet is right you say well no you've been saying all this time and he was right I okay I'm laying that back in your lap I'm not so don't worry about it i doesn't made my emphasis I don't care what they would come up with and prove that brother Branham was this or that or the other been married 49 times and all this that in the other there's no way to take away the revelation from my heart and if there is a way to take it away from your heart then it's not in your heart it's letters on the page you're still arguing you still fussing about things you know this way I am I just make it plain let's say this is that I don't worry about it but he said now before I tell you about these things of The Book of Revelations he said I want you to know who I am now you remember how we kept emphasizing that because only by knowing who he was could we believe the truth of romaine truth alright and by him explaining remember what we went through explained who he was who was he he was one true and the greatest revelation the prophet said of all things is to see who this Jesus Christ really is alright but just remember this point he starts out showing who he is then he starts showing who you are I mean talking about God now income you know the profit is when it brought this to where we have the understanding I'm talking about God in His Word God and His Word said I want you to know who I am I'm the Alpha and the Omega I'm the beginning of the end I'm the which was and she'll come we went through that in a message what you see when you see as I said the brother said I can only see in myself so no you can't see it in yourself first I said I understand your point you your thought is good but it you don't see it that way brother I said you got to see him in you've got to see Oh God and Christ then you can see Christ in the church uh-huh so he starts off in Revelations to show who he is before he starts declaring anything to the ages though he's shortening he's the almighty the Alpha and Omega the beginning in he he's the one true and living God uh-huh but see then it has to come to a place that when we see who we are now I'm going to make the statement and I'm going to mean it straight the only way the gates of Hell cannot prevail against this message is for you to realize this message is alive in you that's as blunt as I can put it see anybody out there you realize that that's what I've I've got everything I think got no eggs and no other baskets you know as we call it ain't got nothing left over just in case this don't work everything I've got is based upon this Word of God I always have been I always just been that away it's always based upon the Word of God ain't saying I understand all of it I didn't say that I said what I understand you can't take away he's like a brother big brother came to the house one time and he's sitting on the porch talking and and he said God is known in the number for his life what are you getting at well the number for his life I said no now you're off just a little bit hold it I said according to the prophet the number three is life unless said then you take justice ain't occasion to baptism in the Holy Ghost you got life I said now according to the same prophet he takes it to the number four as justification same case the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word I don't know but I said you're making your wrong statement so that's where d'arbonne stopping you from saying what you're saying because you're making it wrong see if I leave you with a thought that you think that I believe that the number four I said I'm not with all these other guys that run around saying fours an antichrist number not the Prophet said it was but then he's was the one that said it was the number of restoration so then we got to get down to that season that's how easy it can be to slide something in you know God's number four then in this other guy come on so we're gonna on God's numbers satan's numbers for but you just put it back straight say well you put it on number three as being the number of life and then we'll go on from that with the word right because see that way then I'm looking for something more to be there in the Bible than to just be now listen justification sanctification the baptism the old ago there's more to it praise God for that point or thought but there's more to the story all right so name starts off and he says before I tell you anything I want you to know who I am now could we pick up from that thought for just a moment forgive me and to bring it to the basis that we've got to realize who he is all right but then if you don't realize who you are who you are because that's the important part is seeing who you are all right so he starts off just keep these notes because I'm having it I'm cutting the message I'm gonna take the rest of it later Sunday but to realize who he is then it's to realize of what he has made us we're not nothing we're not worthy of anything that's all we won't worry about that don't get concerned with brother Dale's trying to make us something I'm trying to make us what the Bible says we are we just read that the Prophet said every son and daughter of God was the word of God interpreted right all right then to see who he is gets it started in the right direction but now if the Book of Revelations don't reveal who we are then we missed the whole story so what does he immediately start off with as I said he said okay now for you doing I want you to know who I am so he said okay I'm the Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end and he which was all of these times he's bringing it down and but then he stops not stops revealing who he is and what's going on he stops and I don't guess you call it changes course because then he starts talking about the bride so now to realise who he is is wonderful that's got to be that statement but to realize what he has made us is that the scripture is he that has made us not we ourselves who are his people the Sheep of his pasture right then before he starts explaining the times in the doing he said I want you to know who I am so he defines who is he covers who is the Alpha the Omega he's one true and living God the revelation of Jesus Christ the entire Bible unveiling there in human flesh but then it looks hard to what he does he takes it from the basis of explaining who he is and he starts explaining who you are come on brothers feet pull it up and I'll get it to going go ahead to revelations 1 verse 9 we read a little bit while you're getting there but we need that scripture I didn't think about going this way so alright verse 9 and I John who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and Kingdom of the patience of the saints which was on the Isle of Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet know that voice speaks and says saying I am Alpha and Omega the first in the list and what they'll see us write in the book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum now Tyra Sardis Philadelphia lady Oh seal I look and I turned to see the voice I turned to see the voice now John on earth remember the point now I want you to know who I am John on earth had walked and associated with this man that is now speaking because there's a red-letter who speaking so it's got to be Jesus Christ now we'll get back on these other things well don't don't get so much jumpy fight and running about about this and know that was this when that was brother branham that was this wouldn't it just leave all that alone for a while and just go with it some think it's lame it plainly tells you who this is it plainly tells you here what's taking place but it plainly tells you what he wants you to understand so they hadn't got that up revelations brother okay I got a couple of trainees somebody flopped a thing and bring up revelations revelations one okay we got it now so look what he says I John who also am your brother and companion in tribulation in the kingdom of patience of Jesus Christ was in the isle that is called Patmos for the word of God on the testimonies he and it was in his spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet he turns to see the voice he knows who's talking that's the emphasis I want you to think about for a minute he knows who's talking this is not a surprised voice or some hidden vain john knows who this is he knows the voice from when he was on earth with him and he turns to see the voice he doesn't turn to see the person brother Brennan said because he knew who the person was now I got this will pick it up Sunday because I know we won't get it tonight so just bear with me but look what he said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying the trumpet is saying the voice that I'm Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what that see us writing a book I'm sending them to the seven sir all right who is this speaking the Lord Jesus Christ right all right and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks he knows the voice that's the point he knows the voice or who the voice is he knows that's the voice of the Lord Jesus because he said I'm the Alpha under amigo I'm though he knows that voice but he turns to see the voice not to person he was expecting in other words to see the Lord Jesus Christ and he saw him but what did he see him as come on what he seemed that and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle now what do you see he saw seven golden candlesticks we know who that is and what is to be in to be the church ages and the things but when he turns he's not lost in other word is not surprised to turn around because he knew what he was going to see but the surprise was what he saw he never saw the Lord Jesus Christ standing there in physical form he saw the form that he wanted a man to know now here's the point before we go any further he says John I want you to know who I am they need to describe who he is and then a voice speaks and he turns to hear our to face that direction he sees um let's see what would have called it he sees the secondary work maybe wrong way of expressing it but in other words what he saw was the Lord Jesus Christ but he saw it as the son of man standing in the seven golden candlesticks that's what he did he's turned to say brother I don't see it I'll give you these Sunday well just lay it down I'll read it Sunday he said he saw a bride well because he saw one like unto the Son of Man it doesn't say saw the Son of man standing it it's one like unto the Son of Man same things that were in Daniel Daniel sees in when it comes to him it's one lakh under the Son of Man when you're using the word like under the son of man you're meaning that it is a point that you're trying to see is God in another form being revealed so before we go any farther John says our God says to John I want you to know who I am then when he finishes up describing who he is he said now I want you to know who you are right because he turns and sees one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he saw the Lord Jesus Christ in His Church saw him standing in his church one lakh unto the Son of man who was the son of man when he was on earth the Lord Jesus Christ who demands say I the Son of man I am I'm the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I'm now all of that my name is Jesus cuz that's who he was the Son of Man all right now he says before I tell you anything about these ages in the things of time and life and what takes place I want you to know I don't know who you are I know who you are and I put you in the correct position because he said I know you won't try to take my place you won't try to do anything like that that you'll realize who you are because of what I've done right if the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end is he's a god all and all then when he sees him in bride form are you listening just listen to a point John before we go any further and to tell you anything about these ages I want you to see who I am and he describes himself too John when it was which is you'll come all of the Alpha Namita being now what does he say now before we go any further I want you to see who you are because John was put dark too right and bring to the ages what he saw now throughout the seven church ages now right there spout throughout the seven church ages not just the first age and not just the life stage it's going to take seven Church ages to bring into manifestation the seven golden candlesticks is that sensible and the names only gives the ages and all the things all right but one age can't do it you came sex just this life stage oh look at what we are here amen we'll look at what we are amen I agree but we're not all of it because he's going to reveal what he's going to do in seven Church ages he's going to come on the scene to manifest himself now get this I said I'll read this any more see Jesus himself when he was here in flesh he didn't know when he was going to come but the Prophet says now after he comes to Patmos said he knows he said he knows all right he's gonna describe how he's gonna come come on raise your scripture he said I don't know when I'm coming said only the Father Knows but when he comes to Patmos he knows but he knows how he gets there he gets there through a group of people when are we gonna realize church that the Bible and the things as I said there's not letters on the page it's a revelation of Almighty God to mankind and he cannot reveal himself now listen he cannot reveal himself without showing that you are part of him that's the secret of it all that's the hope of all Christianity that's that's everything that should be in any of our hearts and lives is to know and realize that without him were nothing okay we got better what if you know without us I like go brother Theo the way he brought it a number of years ago and he was talking about Jesus and brother Theo Erasmus from Africa and he said now you just take it said his name is j esus and he said now if you take us out of it which is us he said his name is Jess he said thank complete so thereby you gotta have the word Jesus you see he come to make himself known yes God came down to mankind to make yourself known to reveal himself to mankind he didn't just pick up a people or grab some kind of something and throw it in and make a story right the story was written before the foundation of the world so if he's in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he's in his bride bride form so he cannot be made and I'm quoting brother Branham now he said he's not complete without us he won all of those quotes you know if I quoted it's laying there somewhere might take a while to honey but be glad to yeah he's not complete without us now it's not the fact of how good we are or what he needs of us to fulfill those things it's what he said that's why I emphasize it well ago when he turned to see the voice he knew that voice he knew who that was but the surprise was where he was seen that vultures great man one day riding down a road on a horse going to kill Christians he struck down in the middle of the day by a great blinding light he knows now come on you never thought would run around him or what he saying how did Paul know about Jesus in everything to do with it but what did he say he said he knew that that pillar of fire right was the Jehovah of the old all he needed was the statement to be made I'm Jesus and their persecutors struck a man blind struck him - worth it he winds up wanting to give his life for that one that had come to him Paul saw who that was Gudrun said he would never a call that pillar of our Lord but now the surprise was was when the voice spoke back see Paul had never heard that voice so he ain't like John that would have know the voice you get to MphasiS well ago John knew the voice he knew that was that he was going to turn to see the surprise was just what he saw when he turned to see he seen a bride standing in the candles - what about Paul Paul sees a pillar of fire what couldn't Satan impersonate a pillar of fire and everything look why did Paul call him Lord the only thing he had was a pillar of fire right but he said Lord little Ron said he knew that that pillar of fire was a Jehovah the Old Testament Almighty God he never could hear the voice so that didn't work he didn't have what John had so it wouldn't work but when that voice did speak he had to define who it was he didn't say I was Jehovah the Old Testament I was there said no what did he say he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecuted now listen for a minute you don't think this way how would that prophet know what would be the key why was it not that Paul could have got mixed up in seeing a pillar of fire don't you believe Satan can impersonate all those thing there's got to be more to the story so when the voice spoke then only who it was he said I'm Jesus and our persecutors now listen Paul knew for certain who he is persecuting right now you agree with me are you listening Paul knew who he was persecuting he wasn't persecuting no Romans he wouldn't persecute and no it's my lights and highlights and Jebusites and whatever eyes he knew who he was persecuting by now he had given his consent to death Ben dar was seeing Stephan stoned and Stephan looks up and he said Father forgive them he said they don't know what they're doing Paul heard him as he was describing that I see Jesus it begins to dawn on Paul about that time that should Jehovah the old would have to be Jesus of the new he come to a point of realization what was taking place that he had been killing Christians he had been persecuting those who claimed the name of Jesus do you get what I'm saying how did he know that pillar of fire was real why would it be that he would not be able to know I mean you know how did he know because when that pillar fire begin to talk back he knew that was all Paul or Saul you know what is that why persecutest thou me he said who are you lord right Paul still all mister he got the new birth yet come on that's not all still laying there on the ground rolling around he said I'm Jesus now put it this way he said Paul you understand the Jehovah the old listen now I want you to know that's who's talking to you are you listening a pillar of fire could be impersonated but when that pillar of fire spoke back to something that Paul was doing he was killing those that had the interpretation of the word of God he was killing the Christians so it would just looking at a pillar of fire it was what to pull her far say it if that pillar fire never said anything he would have never caught on but when that pillar of fire spoke back and said I'm Jesus whom thou persecutors it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks you know I've heard everybody explain that and I'm not different with nobody but it's never been I never got the right understanding to that why would he say it that it was hard for thee to kick against to prick I've heard definitions have ever formed but you know the one definition I like is what I think even though the Apostle Paul was a man that went out there and killed the Christians but yet he kept that law to the letter he fathered that law to the letter and he knew that he ought not be doing those thing because he could follow that law back there don't you think Paul would think about it I'm out here kill it killing these people and they're crying out about Jesus I never met him never seen him never heard him for each I said there's one thing about it what I've always believed to be the pillar of fire God himself he says now stands before me and I must accept it as ever done you that way come on musicians never done that to you we'll get the thoughts will read it from more on it just been taking on this for about two or three weeks Paul knew that was great Jehovah in you that was but not because it was just a pillar of fire but because that pillar of fire spoke and that pillar of fire spoke according to the word back on these things what does it mean to be a living Bible what you think Paul looking down there and seeing that because brother around and said he wound up saying I want to die he could have got by even God warned him told him not to go certain ways you know the scripture but he said I thing what did he die I want to die because I've persecuted Jesus Christ I want to die for the cause ain't worthy to live see God kept him alive for all the time he needed him then Satan stepped in right took his life listen but he never forgot I'm quoting brother Branham perforated he never forgot the day that he would hold in that coat for them to kill Stephen he never forgot that well I'm because he saw who Jesus really is what about oh we got brothers you seemed a little like on these times Oh greater is He that is in Cain greater is He that is in me it's primarily that is in me would you know before he that's in did you know the voice of God in greater is He that is in me why do you put all your headers everything all that is in me than he that's in the world and maybe for shade and like Aurora what do you put it out in the church all right seeing whom he may devour the Bible tells the coalition to go over the old if Jesus many souls have been his prey before I can say anything about the ages or express what I say about his promise I want you to know de Lions overcome and power we send in grater and I will tell Hill you are me greater is He that is in me Oh from it all true me paddle you that is in me than he that's in oh they did the mess to the seven golden candlesticks a day of Pentecost
