[29:12] early now we don't we don't have any
[29:16] infant baptisms if that's what you
[29:18] believe that's fine but we don't do that
[29:21] we do what the Bible says - worth it you
[29:23] know they brought the little ones to
[29:25] Jesus and then he prayed over them
[29:28] dedicated them to the Lord and then he
[29:30] would give them back to the parents all
[29:32] right now that's what we do here and
[29:34] everybody if they will derstand
[29:36] because what we do here we dedicate to
[29:39] baby get it back to the parents to raise
[29:41] the child
[29:42] we'll see wherever one standing for the
[29:45] dedication because we're all to live
[29:48] before this child to where the child can
[29:50] see Jesus Christ that's the goal of
[29:53] everybody should be to live before the
[29:56] child and that way mama daddy brothers
[29:59] sisters they can all have a part to do
[30:02] with you know in raising the child

[32:18] agree with this part back was babies
[32:21] used to be born when they were just
[32:23] almost immune to sicknesses for like a
[32:26] six months period you know because of
[32:28] the the way they were mowing and
[32:30] everything that's all breaking down to
[32:32] her you know in the human race and the
[32:35] genes and the makeup is breaking down
[32:37] but still we believe in dedicating them
[32:41] to the Lord and asking God to take care
[32:43] of them
[32:44] because that's that's the point then we
[32:46] live before them that they may see a

[34:09] are sick we ask you to just reach down
[34:11] and touch the ones that are sick
[34:13] deliver them let your love in your grace
[34:15] be with each one we thank you for all
[34:18] things and we ask you to just forgive
[34:20] our sins and cleanse us from all
[34:23] unrighteousness and keep us in Jesus

[34:29] Matthew 16 we'll go to verse 13 when
[34:36] Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea
[34:38] Philippi yes this disciples saying whom
[34:41] do men say that I the Son of Man and
[34:45] they said some say thorat John the
[34:50] Baptist some alas other jury mice or one
[34:54] of the prophets and he said unto them
[34:56] but whom say ye that I am and Simon
[35:01] Peter answered and said thou art the
[35:04] Christ the Son of the Living God and
[35:08] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[35:10] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[35:14] blood hath not revealed it unto thee in
[35:18] other words even my own life's not made
[35:20] this known now who makes it no but my
[35:23] father which is in heaven and I say unto
[35:26] thee that thou art Peter and upon this
[35:28] rock I'll build my church and the gates
[35:31] of Hell shall not prevail against it and
[35:35] I will give unto thee the keys of the
[35:39] kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou
[35:41] shalt bind on earth
[35:43] she'll be bound up spell bound on earth
[35:46] she'll be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[35:48] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[35:50] loosed in heaven let's go to Hebrews
[35:53] just for the one scripture in Hebrews it
[36:06] would take three verses God who at
[36:10] sundry times and in divers manners spake
[36:12] in time past unto the father's by the
[36:16] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[36:19] unto us by his son then we at the
[36:21] pointed heir of all things with whom
[36:23] also he made the world
[36:25] who being the brightness of his glory
[36:27] and the Express image of his person and
[36:31] upholding all things by the word of his
[36:33] power when he hath about had by himself
[36:36] purged our sins sat down on the right
[36:40] hand of the Majesty on high amen you may
[36:43] be seated
[36:44] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[36:47] the word now we know that you know that
[36:57] we study the Bible and we know that
[37:00] throughout the Old Testament because
[37:03] that's what we'll just speak about for a
[37:05] minute you saw God manifesting himself
[37:11] and that's why we read Hebrews they're
[37:14] worth it in times past and he spake you
[37:20] know to mankind by our it would be
[37:24] translated in the prophets because they
[37:28] were speaking God's Word that was the
[37:31] way to deliver the way God delivered our
[37:33] brought down the Bible as we call it to
[37:37] her that we could read it was by the
[37:40] prophets that spoke those things and you
[37:44] know in doing that all right and they
[37:46] would be called it's in you know son of
[37:50] man you find that terminology used a lot
[37:55] in the Old Testament son of man prophesy
[37:57] to Jeremiah and all of the prophets
[37:59] because that was for the time God using
[38:05] someone to speak his word and bringing
[38:09] forth the you know the Word of God is
[38:13] what God's Way of making himself known
[38:16] all right because that's what we're
[38:18] talking about the making God known
[38:21] because that's what we're here for
[38:23] we're here to understand we're here to
[38:26] follow and be guided in the word see
[38:30] throughout that Old Testament you know a
[38:32] lot of people can't seem to find God in
[38:34] doing it but back there you had a lot of
[38:36] times that he would speak through the
[38:39] even David would speak so until it would
[38:42] sound like he'd be speaking in the very
[38:44] first person David would say they
[38:46] pierced my hands and my feet you know
[38:49] and stuff like that and that's how close
[38:51] they were to it because God was using
[38:55] those Old Testament Saints to bring
[38:59] forth his being our person or
[39:03] understanding to bring God to a reality
[39:06] because that's the whole purpose what's
[39:09] the purpose of the Bible what's the
[39:12] purpose of Christianity what should be
[39:15] our thoughts on Christianity or anything
[39:18] what is it to be we're supposed to be
[39:22] here to let the world see us because
[39:27] they follow us and you know they see us
[39:29] every day but that's way then as we were
[39:32] saying about dedicating the baby see we
[39:35] dedicate the baby we saw that was just
[39:37] dedicated now see every day we live
[39:40] before that child is a great opportunity
[39:43] for that child to be molded you know
[39:47] made into ways that they he can see
[39:51] something and want to be like that that
[39:53] he sees well that's the purpose of God
[39:56] in the beginning he wanted to reveal
[39:58] himself to mankind he existed alone back
[40:04] there so he wanted to do something so he
[40:06] created man all right in in creating man
[40:10] and bringing him for as he was doing
[40:13] that then he was making himself known or
[40:17] revealing himself you know in those
[40:20] terminologies all right in that stage
[40:24] for you know a few thousand years as he
[40:27] was revealing himself in those forms
[40:30] that best he could do back there all
[40:33] right but one day see he walked upon
[40:35] earth himself and Isaiah 9:6 says unto
[40:39] us a child is born unto us a son is
[40:40] given
[40:41] all right in his name shall be father
[40:45] it's a great number of titles to come
[40:49] forth all right and that would be the
[40:52] Lord Jesus
[40:52] Christ as he walked upon earth all right
[40:56] no as he walked there then the Bible
[41:00] said that God was in Christ reconciling
[41:02] the world unto himself but what was the
[41:06] purpose of Jesus Christ coming was to
[41:09] reveal the father not to reveal himself
[41:12] he didn't come to make yourself known he
[41:15] come to make the father known what is
[41:17] our purpose of of Christianity to make
[41:20] our Father known see to the world that's
[41:24] why we were supposed to live that before
[41:26] the world that they can see Christ in
[41:28] our our being and then want to be like
[41:31] that alright but see then you see him
[41:33] died as he walked upon the earth and he
[41:36] declared on many occasions that he was
[41:40] the son of man who the men say i the son
[41:43] of man am well they didn't understand it
[41:47] cousins i've always say about Peter when
[41:49] he said that to Peter you know he said
[41:51] who men say that I the Son of Man am
[41:53] Peter said thou art the Christ the Son
[41:55] of the Living God now he didn't ask him
[41:57] that question he asked him the question
[42:00] of who was the son of man alright but
[42:04] yet see for the time we read are that
[42:08] were that jesus said upon this rock not
[42:11] on Peter and see not even on Jesus but
[42:14] on the revelation of Jesus Christ he
[42:17] said upon this rock I'll build my church
[42:18] and the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[42:20] against it they've been against it down
[42:23] through time but they've never been able
[42:24] to close the church out completely
[42:26] because they don't matter how bad it got
[42:28] in the Dark Ages you still had that as
[42:31] it was to come forth and promised the
[42:34] word they'd be a restoration all right
[42:36] see then you see him as he lived upon
[42:39] earth as the son of man and he kept the
[42:44] clearin he didn't say I'm the son of God
[42:46] he said under Son of Man because he was
[42:49] a human vessel that's the one thing that
[42:53] we need to remember I I used to even
[42:55] when I was a kid I thought well you know
[42:58] if he was God in flesh then he couldn't
[43:00] stump his toe and hurt himself well that
[43:02] was my carnality but as I begin to reel
[43:06] later on then he was God in human
[43:09] flashes the Bible would be speaking of
[43:11] it that's easy to follow and the Bible
[43:15] even says that the eternal God head you
[43:18] know father son Holy Ghost can be
[43:21] understood by the things that we see
[43:23] that we have no excuse
[43:26] the you're a perfect example of what God
[43:30] was in the basis of what it is see you
[43:33] know you're a person you've been a
[43:37] father a mother whatever you have many
[43:39] manifestations we all do but yet we're
[43:42] one person I'm a father I'm a son I'm a
[43:45] human but that's the many manifestation
[43:48] but I'm the same person it don't change
[43:51] persons it just changes the way you
[43:53] manifest yourself all right he
[43:55] manifested himself there in the Old
[43:57] Testament and using those prophets and
[44:01] as he did he brought forth the word for
[44:04] that time within when he walked upon
[44:06] this earth in the human flesh that we
[44:09] call Jesus that body was a creation to
[44:14] where that the purpose of death could be
[44:16] fulfilled because that was the reason he
[44:19] came he came to die knowing that you and
[44:22] I could not follow him or understand him
[44:25] you know we couldn't comprehend God in
[44:29] the basis see God would have to come to
[44:31] mankind and make yourself known some way
[44:36] to work that you know we could
[44:39] understand it so he came and made
[44:41] himself known in flash and he lived his
[44:44] life and in all it but he he came for
[44:47] the purpose of dying that he could be as
[44:50] the Bible would talk about that he's my
[44:52] brother well I see he became a human
[44:57] being in flesh all right
[45:02] that body was a creation yes by the word
[45:05] we believe that all right we believe in
[45:08] the virgin birth we don't believe in
[45:10] Mary having anything to do with that
[45:13] other than the fact that she was a human
[45:15] income by incubator
[45:17] there's the same thing you know and as
[45:19] she did all she done was received to the
[45:23] Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee and
[45:24] that which is born in these they are a
[45:27] part a person was used to bring that
[45:31] body into being to where it would be
[45:33] kinfolks to us to where he could
[45:36] understand us and as he walked in life
[45:39] you notice he went through so then he
[45:41] was a child to a child he went through
[45:44] the parts of life of 10 years old 12
[45:47] years old he he was a little boy you
[45:50] know and he walked and he done you know
[45:53] as such little boys and things done we
[45:56] went out and climbed the trees and
[45:57] hollered and sounds like Tarzan and
[46:00] jumped out and screamed and played and
[46:02] had a good time you know as children
[46:04] we'll see he done that because he was a
[46:07] he was coming forth to be what would be
[46:13] needed for the time but then it came
[46:15] forth and life that he came to where his
[46:17] purpose was
[46:18] so he started ministering he started
[46:21] preaching about thirty years of age he
[46:23] began his ministry and you know and as
[46:27] he did he he began to speak about things
[46:30] and he talked about son of man well they
[46:34] couldn't understand because they
[46:36] couldn't follow his they knew a son of
[46:38] man they knew the terminologies but they
[46:41] couldn't understand how this man could
[46:43] speak about being the son of man but
[46:46] that's who he was he was God made
[46:49] manifest in human flesh all right
[46:53] because that's where it goes John 1 in
[46:55] the beginning was the word Word was with
[46:56] God in the Word was God verse 14 says
[46:59] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[47:01] among us and we beheld it as his only
[47:04] begotten all right see then as it comes
[47:07] forth on in life he come to the purpose
[47:11] of having to know that he without to die
[47:13] so he would constantly speak of things
[47:15] of going away and and dying giving his
[47:19] life and things would happen and as he
[47:22] did then he it came into being what his
[47:25] real purpose was far to release that
[47:27] life
[47:29] God was dwelling in that human vessel
[47:32] alright
[47:33] Almighty God or else we're the most
[47:36] deceived people that are in the world
[47:38] think because he he was either God or
[47:42] not God see if you say wouldn't God what
[47:46] are we doing here let's go eat drink be
[47:49] merry because tomorrow we die but if he
[47:52] was God we better depend upon the fact
[47:54] of believing who he was he said I and my
[47:58] father are one
[48:01] well where they want or were they two or
[48:05] three or what were they by looking at it
[48:08] as seeing what you see and and
[48:10] comprehending from the scriptures that
[48:12] there are that human vessel was made for
[48:15] the purpose of receiving so when that
[48:18] baby was born God stepped in to that
[48:23] human vessel alright Almighty God
[48:27] Himself just stepped into that vessel as
[48:30] it came forward just as when the little
[48:33] William came forth right there was a
[48:35] life from God that when he came into the
[48:38] world then he went from living as a fish
[48:44] floating in water in alive but just in a
[48:50] second he was out and you couldn't put
[48:52] him back in water no more I've been
[48:54] there seen too many of them when they
[48:55] wash your face and things you know and
[48:57] and when they do you see them they'll
[48:59] that's rubbing faces and stick them
[49:02] under the spigot without for a little
[49:04] bit that kind of in between two worlds
[49:05] but then they start getting choking and
[49:08] you don't put them back on learning more
[49:09] that way because it changes things all
[49:12] right but that little fella see was God
[49:14] himself in human flesh that's why the
[49:17] scripture speak of under us a child is
[49:19] born unto us a son is given then as he
[49:24] raised up he came to his purpose as I
[49:26] said to where he could give his life
[49:29] that could make the way for you and I to
[49:31] be saved
[49:33] alright see the work today everything is
[49:36] in terminologies as we called it the
[49:40] educational world and I'm not against
[49:41] that I believe in
[49:42] but I don't believe in trying to make
[49:45] the educational world above the word I
[49:47] believe the word first and then the
[49:49] education is fine all right but seeing
[49:51] the line of Education and said then we
[49:54] we try to understand everything by our
[49:56] own terminologies well those things
[49:59] don't work we have to depend upon God if
[50:02] we're going to talk about spiritual
[50:03] matters all right so then he came to
[50:06] give his life alright on that day when
[50:10] he died on Calvary what was death
[50:15] what's death to you and I you said well
[50:17] did he die did one now the one that was
[50:20] within him did not
[50:21] it just exited the body just like you do
[50:26] you said well sorts Oh God
[50:28] well what happened well he's died now
[50:33] tell me what happened see what was
[50:35] motivating our making you live as a
[50:38] human being which is the soul in the
[50:40] spirit of mankind and in that it that
[50:44] just exits out of the body and leaves
[50:47] the body all right that's what happened
[50:49] to the Lord Jesus God just extracted
[50:52] himself forever how you say step back
[50:55] came out of flesh if you don't call it
[50:57] acted the part of death to mankind
[51:00] because he didn't die in spirit he
[51:04] didn't die in soul the body was what
[51:06] died cause take the life out the body
[51:09] dies I mean that's certain to all of us
[51:12] doesn't matter who all right but then
[51:15] see one day you know some few days later
[51:19] he comes back he's resurrected he goes
[51:23] up nittany and then he comes back onto
[51:25] their Pentecost to live in the people
[51:28] okay
[51:29] you had one little Jesus walking on the
[51:32] earth you had one little Messiah as we
[51:34] call it but they're only at that
[51:36] Pentecost he had 122 first quack you
[51:39] know first time it happened is 120 see
[51:41] if Satan had went on vacation that's
[51:43] where he goofs up he can't never follow
[51:44] it correctly he tries to break up the
[51:47] plan and mess up everything so he
[51:50] thought killing him would do it killing
[51:52] the body was what released the life that
[51:55] could come back
[51:56] into you and Aiko that was the only way
[51:57] we could ever have anything is for him
[52:00] to come and live in us so Paul said now
[52:02] it's why Christ in you the hope of glory
[52:05] all right see on the day of Pentecost
[52:07] then he came into the church and there
[52:11] still fulfill the 121st one three
[52:15] thousand rottnest in a few minutes down
[52:16] Stars and like I said it's Satan and one
[52:19] on vacation he'd been better off but
[52:22] he's too dumb you know I'm sorry but I
[52:24] feel sorry for him is the smartest thing
[52:26] there is outside of God yet he ain't got
[52:29] enough sense to realize what's going on
[52:31] God this used him as a plan to get it to
[52:34] where he could exit out of that flesh
[52:36] and and when he stepped out of the flesh
[52:38] then he couldn't understand what
[52:40] happened but on the day of Pentecost he
[52:43] had a hundred and twentieth the first
[52:44] why what little Jesus is little Messiah
[52:47] stepped up little children of God
[52:50] downstairs it goes and they're all
[52:52] having a big time and 3,000 are saved
[52:55] they one message all right starting the
[52:59] church and bringing it down through time
[53:02] Dhar then would be fulfilled as that
[53:05] Holy Ghost would be coming into the
[53:06] people the new birth is we could call it
[53:08] as it begin to come into the people now
[53:11] it's fulfilled the Scriptures the of all
[53:16] that Old Testament all of those things
[53:19] that was transpiring was being fulfilled
[53:22] right there and coming in the church and
[53:25] that's where he said to Peter now watch
[53:27] he said to Peter as we read the
[53:29] scripture he said who demands say I the
[53:31] Son of Man am well Peter couldn't
[53:35] understand that he said dark the Christ
[53:39] the Son of the Living God
[53:40] all right the Christ means The Anointed
[53:42] are the anointed the Messiah all right
[53:46] so then here comes the Messiah on the
[53:49] day of Pentecost right back into the
[53:51] hearts of the Saints in what we would
[53:53] call the new birth and as it would come
[53:55] forth see then that would be the son of
[53:58] God as he was speaking up and he said
[54:00] upon this rock I'll build my church and
[54:03] the gates of hell can't prevail so down
[54:05] through the church age is now a time
[54:07] from Calvary up to where we are
[54:10] it's been not son of man think because
[54:14] that would be the the end time we'll get
[54:16] that in a second but it would be the son
[54:18] of God God in you Christ in you the hope
[54:22] of glory when he would release that life
[54:25] that it would come back in to the people
[54:28] on the day of Pentecost making them the
[54:30] family of God are the children of God
[54:32] all right since showing that he would
[54:36] come down through time as son of of God
[54:40] okay then we get down to the end time
[54:43] and as we get down to the end time we we
[54:46] come into this last part of the of life
[54:49] in the journey and we we find that God
[54:52] starts bringing forth again the thoughts
[54:55] of son of man because that would be his
[54:59] point that he would be coming back in
[55:01] human flesh in our flesh he he started
[55:07] that journey on the day of Pentecost
[55:10] when the Upper Room when the Holy Ghost
[55:12] fell upon the people but he's completing
[55:14] his journey here so it's not to remain
[55:17] just son of God is to get to understand
[55:20] where Jesus said who demand say I the
[55:22] son of man they need would go through
[55:26] life and he'd speak of these things and
[55:28] he'd say now I've got to go away and he
[55:30] said if I go away then I'll come back
[55:32] read Matthew Mark Luke and John I'll
[55:35] come back and I'll live in you all right
[55:38] and si Jin in the end time he would
[55:41] return to fulfill the scriptures of
[55:44] Malachi for one of the things that would
[55:46] cover how that he would come back as son
[55:49] of man just for a little while because
[55:53] that would be part of the journey of
[55:55] mankind that the theologians and thing
[55:58] missed that understanding because they
[56:00] couldn't follow him when he was saying
[56:02] something man son of man son of man they
[56:05] couldn't follow that because they had no
[56:07] comprehension it would take the Holy
[56:09] Ghost itself to reveal those things the
[56:13] world would be seen but it could be son
[56:15] of man back tire son of man in human
[56:17] flesh then it would be son of God the
[56:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost coming through
[56:22] the church ages
[56:24] I'm trying to make this a two-fold point
[56:26] okay and in doing it he would come for a
[56:30] little while back in the last days the
[56:32] son of man okay
[56:34] in the days when the son of man Luke
[56:36] 1730 is to be revealed we're in our day
[56:41] and that's why Jesus come over in John
[56:43] and he speaks of at that day that's the
[56:48] day of this revelation it'll be made
[56:51] known all right so we come here in the
[56:54] end time and it's made known to us and
[56:55] we see son of man all right what's the
[56:58] next step of the journey because we God
[57:01] always does things in threes to keep it
[57:03] his numbers correct and you go to 7 for
[57:06] completion and all I got but he comes in
[57:09] three sons thing son of man prophet you
[57:15] know deliver the release son of God as
[57:20] the Holy Ghost the new birth to come and
[57:23] live in his church to make his church
[57:25] him manifest upon earth all right
[57:28] then he would be in the millennial reign
[57:32] because the iron roots whether you like
[57:34] it or not our roots are Jewish
[57:36] everything connects back to the Old
[57:38] Testament form of coming forth in the
[57:41] Jewish roots and and the things of our
[57:43] being coming up all right it was
[57:46] promised to David that his son would sit
[57:50] on his throne okay par phrasing just a
[57:54] lot of Scripture but tying it together
[57:56] alright the natural son of David was
[58:00] solomon solomon went to the throne when
[58:03] David you know finished his journey in
[58:06] Solomon it was a great Kingdom under
[58:09] Solomon the greatest Kingdom that ever
[58:11] been brought of our mankind upon the
[58:14] earth it was a great time there all
[58:17] right Solomon was the natural son of
[58:20] David all right but it was promised to
[58:25] David coming from the tribe of Judah
[58:28] because that would be the journey that
[58:31] in the tribes in the coming it was
[58:33] promised that a lawgiver would come
[58:36] forth
[58:37] the tribe of juda all right and see that
[58:40] lawgiver would be God in human flesh all
[58:44] right so now watch the catch on it
[58:46] the little woman that was standing there
[58:49] one day and and and they had said
[58:51] something and and she began to say you
[58:54] know he was talking to her and and she
[58:56] began to say you know we worship here
[58:58] and we worship there and he said oh
[58:59] that's true we said there come a time
[59:01] when you worship in spirit and truth all
[59:04] right as it began to be made known to
[59:06] her she had no right to call him because
[59:09] she was a Gentile she had no right to
[59:12] call him Lord he was her natural Lord
[59:16] which he had no right to call him the
[59:19] names and the things she was seeking him
[59:21] from what the Yeti told her he said it's
[59:26] promised to you Gentiles will be brought
[59:30] in in other words you come into the
[59:32] kingdom but the main thing is to the
[59:34] Jews Oh Bible said he came to his own
[59:35] and his own received in naught but as
[59:37] many as received him gave he power to
[59:39] become the sons of God
[59:41] all right and as it did see and here
[59:43] we're going now in the end time that God
[59:46] is turning shortly from where we are as
[59:49] the Gentile dispensation and the promise
[59:52] is to go to the Jews or because they are
[59:55] God's chosen people whether we like them
[59:58] or not or whatever it is they got them
[1:00:00] to do with it that's nothing nothing to
[1:00:03] any of us whether we don't agree with it
[1:00:05] or not we don't have any right to differ
[1:00:08] because we just left where we are the
[1:00:10] God's gonna do it all right and he's
[1:00:13] gonna come back to his people and he's
[1:00:15] going to in the millennial reign Jesus
[1:00:17] said you sit with me in my kingdom
[1:00:21] that's what they wanted they kept saying
[1:00:23] them with the women - to Jesus you know
[1:00:26] said let my son set one on one side and
[1:00:28] one on the other in your kingdom he said
[1:00:31] that's not for me to give because he
[1:00:35] knew he had to follow the correct lineup
[1:00:36] of the journey to bring forth Christ to
[1:00:39] be living in us and Jesus said he sit
[1:00:42] with me in my throne as I have overcome
[1:00:45] and sit down on my father strong all
[1:00:47] right and see in that then it would come
[1:00:50] to them
[1:00:51] niall rang in the millennial reign Jesus
[1:00:54] Christ will be sitting on the throne of
[1:00:56] David now in a millennium you have a
[1:00:59] throne a temple you have things that are
[1:01:02] made for the Millennial right the
[1:01:03] Millennium is to the Jews it's not to
[1:01:06] you and I will be there as we called it
[1:01:08] on the honeymoon you know we go up we go
[1:01:12] to the marriage supper we're getting
[1:01:13] everything finished up and we come back
[1:01:15] as to the millennial reign of a thousand
[1:01:19] years upon earth
[1:01:20] but that's to the Jews and David will be
[1:01:22] sitting on the throne now naturally
[1:01:24] where his wife his bride will be sitting
[1:01:26] around him all right that's the terms of
[1:01:30] the journey from son of man son of God
[1:01:34] and for just a little while in the end
[1:01:36] time he comes back a son of man again
[1:01:39] and then he goes to son of David all
[1:01:42] right
[1:01:43] the two the Jews have a promise and I
[1:01:47] like what one when you said about it he
[1:01:49] said I can't happen if God chose me and
[1:01:52] he's done anything do that you said well
[1:01:55] I mean if no no we didn't have anything
[1:01:57] to do where we're at God chose us
[1:01:59] but those Jews have a right to come back
[1:02:02] in because they were blinded for you and
[1:02:06] I'll according to Paul into where we
[1:02:08] could come back in they could come back
[1:02:10] in the last days after our journey of
[1:02:13] what is called the Gentile dispensation
[1:02:15] now in the Gentile dispensation
[1:02:18] that's just what it means it means
[1:02:19] Gentiles anybody can be born again in
[1:02:21] this dispensation it doesn't matter
[1:02:23] whether you Jew or your you know Mexican
[1:02:27] and in the words you want to use
[1:02:28] terminologies one you want to use
[1:02:30] Chinese or Japanese or anything anybody
[1:02:34] can be born constant it's a Gentile
[1:02:36] which means nations and nations are
[1:02:39] coming into the body of Jesus Christ all
[1:02:43] right when that's finished God will turn
[1:02:44] from there to the Jews to take out of
[1:02:48] them according to the book of Revelation
[1:02:51] 144,000 that they'll be able to have a
[1:02:54] people and you'll go into the millennial
[1:02:57] reign but my point is to get to you to
[1:03:00] remember the situation he comes as three
[1:03:03] sons name
[1:03:05] so the man from God son of David now he
[1:03:09] has many manifestations
[1:03:11] he's the Rose of Sharon the lily of the
[1:03:14] valley the bright in the morning star
[1:03:15] the Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[1:03:18] the end it the father son Holy Ghost no
[1:03:20] it's the Lord Jesus Christ that's why we
[1:03:24] believe in one true and living God then
[1:03:26] jesus said I come in my father's name
[1:03:30] right well now his father must have been
[1:03:33] Jesus oh he said he just sent him now I
[1:03:37] didn't say that he said come in my
[1:03:38] father's name I mean you you send me
[1:03:43] some word you say well all right now
[1:03:44] he's passenger Lula well we're gonna
[1:03:47] send him over to the Philippines its
[1:03:49] pastor Lula well you ain't gonna get
[1:03:52] that right you know you wind up like me
[1:03:58] and wait did one time seek her way to
[1:04:00] the Sunnis in the Philippines he Samuel
[1:04:03] way del 2 seconds he and I never did
[1:04:05] like the word jr. it's all rice didn't
[1:04:08] like it so we put the two you know the
[1:04:09] dice on the end well we're going
[1:04:11] actually wound up going out west to hunt
[1:04:14] we were checking our guns in at the
[1:04:16] airport and the guy looked at the thing
[1:04:19] and he said Sam your wait day on ok he
[1:04:24] picked up way too Sam your way day all
[1:04:27] he said we got a problem
[1:04:32] he said who are you I said I'm time your
[1:04:36] way Dale he said who are you he said I'm
[1:04:39] Sam your way Dale the second see they'd
[1:04:41] forgot to put the two little lines on
[1:04:43] the airline ticket so he did had it Mike
[1:04:46] he said we got to do something
[1:04:48] he's they can't be two people on this
[1:04:49] airplane with the same name said we got
[1:04:52] to do something
[1:04:53] so they wound up and put the little
[1:04:54] lines on and sent us home my point is
[1:04:57] you ain't going did you say I'm the
[1:05:00] pastor of spoken word Church I'm going
[1:05:03] to where I want to you can't do it you
[1:05:05] gotta have a name all right
[1:05:08] you gotta have a name well see God's got
[1:05:11] a name you said well his name is God
[1:05:14] know you can make a guard out of
[1:05:16] anything
[1:05:17] the word God means an object of worship
[1:05:21] that's that's the terminologies of God
[1:05:24] it means object of worship the and and
[1:05:27] his name is Jesus what he said I come
[1:05:31] into my father's name the Holy Ghost are
[1:05:33] coming my father coming in the name of
[1:05:35] Jesus we can go through many scriptures
[1:05:37] tying together because we believe in the
[1:05:40] one true and the Living God that's what
[1:05:42] I was trying to say there he was in the
[1:05:44] Old Testament coming down dealing
[1:05:46] through the prophets when he steps into
[1:05:48] the what we would term the new testament
[1:05:50] of era or at a time across he comes
[1:05:53] forth as God in human flesh you say no
[1:05:57] no no we believe in a Trinity now that's
[1:06:00] that's what's been taught us to blind us
[1:06:02] there's no such thing as the word
[1:06:04] Trinity in the Bible it's not there
[1:06:07] there there's no God is a triune being
[1:06:12] because you are a triune being in the
[1:06:15] basis that you are the things that said
[1:06:17] your you're a son you're a father you're
[1:06:20] a human you have many titles to you and
[1:06:23] Jesus had many many titles to himself
[1:06:26] all right but his name was Jesus in my
[1:06:30] name you'll cast out devils in you know
[1:06:32] God it's the name of Jesus it's the only
[1:06:35] name that God ever had you can take the
[1:06:38] name Jesus and run it back to the Old
[1:06:41] Testament and run it back to your
[1:06:43] oversee and all of those titles and all
[1:06:46] this things they've got today you know
[1:06:48] the Yahweh's and the names and the thing
[1:06:51] if they just keep running that back
[1:06:52] they'll find it appear it right back to
[1:06:55] the very self existing Almighty God but
[1:06:58] if they'll take it the other way it'll
[1:06:59] come right straight to Jesus because
[1:07:02] there can't be many gods if it is who's
[1:07:05] the oldest one well we believe in three
[1:07:08] gods
[1:07:08] all right which one's the oldest if he's
[1:07:12] God then so we come up with the idea we
[1:07:16] had the concept see well God in three
[1:07:19] persons Blessed Trinity go week won't go
[1:07:21] eternal now how can you be co-equal you
[1:07:27] got three guards and how are you going
[1:07:28] to have co-equal how's it
[1:07:30] and call one of them a father the other
[1:07:33] a son well you're just too technical
[1:07:35] that might be true but I'm just in the
[1:07:37] Word of God so then we talk about that
[1:07:40] we don't talk about what we think all
[1:07:42] right but getting the point see that
[1:07:45] it's very vital to understand the way
[1:07:49] God comes into being to reveal himself
[1:07:53] making himself known to mankind all
[1:07:57] right
[1:07:57] you see even then the soldier that was
[1:08:00] crucifying him you remember what
[1:08:02] happened there he had more than most of
[1:08:04] them did when he's seen what took place
[1:08:07] that soldier said he must have been the
[1:08:11] son of God because he's seen all the
[1:08:15] things that had taken place and he
[1:08:17] realized there was they were crucifying
[1:08:20] but you know water we talk of the
[1:08:23] crucifix and that's what I'm not against
[1:08:24] the Jews cuz they crucify the Jews
[1:08:26] didn't crucify my god
[1:08:28] my sense is what crucified him my life
[1:08:31] my sense my being he died for me he
[1:08:34] tried to take my place he died it I
[1:08:38] don't have to die he died to release
[1:08:41] that live is expressing to where it
[1:08:43] could come back and and live in us and
[1:08:45] we could be the children of God and
[1:08:49] that's where people miss it at they're
[1:08:51] trying to find some terminologies or
[1:08:53] some great mysterious something it's not
[1:08:56] a mystery once it's made known that God
[1:08:59] can come and live in you you can come
[1:09:04] and live in you yeah but you tell it you
[1:09:09] explain it to me then how that all of
[1:09:12] this can take place you explain to me
[1:09:15] how then a cow eats green grass and
[1:09:23] gives white milk I haven't found one yet
[1:09:26] kids now don't let mom and daddy deceive
[1:09:29] you there's no such thing as a chocolate
[1:09:31] cow to give chocolate milk now that
[1:09:34] don't work somebody's trying to deceive
[1:09:37] you somewhere well how does a cow eat
[1:09:39] green rice and give white milk
[1:09:42] I don't know well I don't I didn't quit
[1:09:46] drinking the milk
[1:09:47] well because it's good see it's the
[1:09:51] point that if we follow God through his
[1:09:54] word he'll reveal himself and I'm trying
[1:09:58] to bring an issue to us now about the
[1:10:03] things of God and in the way he makes
[1:10:05] herself known and I'm not bluffing back
[1:10:08] as far as you think because I'm just
[1:10:10] using the terms a little bit different
[1:10:12] to swing it over into word that we can
[1:10:14] all follow into understanding God is
[1:10:18] trying to reveal himself he's trying to
[1:10:22] reveal himself he revealed himself there
[1:10:26] in flesh in the man we call Jesus now he
[1:10:30] was either God hurry lad well we know
[1:10:34] God can't lie so that solves the problem
[1:10:38] we must be the liars
[1:10:39] let's see God came in human flesh he
[1:10:42] came down through son of man making
[1:10:44] everything in the correct order he had
[1:10:46] to come that away for the purpose of
[1:10:48] dying but once he released that life
[1:10:51] that was within him he would not be the
[1:10:54] Son of man coming forth
[1:10:56] it was the Son of God coming forth are
[1:10:58] the spirit all right
[1:11:02] the great eternal God would come and
[1:11:04] divide itself among the humanities there
[1:11:08] and has been dividing himself ever since
[1:11:10] to where he can come and live in you and
[1:11:13] me
[1:11:14] well I just understand how you can
[1:11:17] divide God it's not like tearing up
[1:11:19] something running out of pieces you know
[1:11:21] or an apple you said in the evening and
[1:11:22] then that a while you're gonna know
[1:11:24] Apple left God's not that way he
[1:11:27] expressed it itself he took this blessed
[1:11:30] it and handed it over a little boy had
[1:11:33] this in his lunch you know he had so
[1:11:36] many fish and so many pieces of bread in
[1:11:39] his lunch now he didn't have McDonald's
[1:11:41] behind him and flooding out all of the
[1:11:43] hamburgers like we did yesterday we've
[1:11:46] got kind of funny but we got over two we
[1:11:49] left real early unless thirty minutes at
[1:11:50] least the head of where we generally run
[1:11:52] and we get over and we stop at Cracker
[1:11:54] Barrell because I love to eat
[1:11:56] Rockabye on this good old food southern
[1:11:58] and till we stopped Cracker Barrel
[1:12:02] nowhere now were later we would steal
[1:12:04] the Cracker Barrel and Danny said to the
[1:12:07] waiter said you know we've been here for
[1:12:10] a while she said she went and looked she
[1:12:12] come back she's nice because she
[1:12:14] could've just bypassed Italy she come
[1:12:16] back she said there's about six more
[1:12:19] tickets ahead of y'all that ain't even
[1:12:22] filled yet well we was done running over
[1:12:25] in the time we're supposed to be heading
[1:12:27] towards the meeting their brother
[1:12:29] languorous so you know what we're done
[1:12:31] we we asked her said would it be a fence
[1:12:33] if if we got up and left
[1:12:35] she's no don't blame you at all it won't
[1:12:37] hurt nothing
[1:12:38] No so we got up and left the only time
[1:12:41] I've ever walked out of a cafe but you
[1:12:43] know what thank God for McDonald's
[1:12:45] because we had to get a bite to eat
[1:12:48] before we got on over her so what we do
[1:12:49] we want to make novels you know they
[1:12:52] don't know how no problems you know but
[1:12:55] I'm getting the point to you if you're
[1:12:57] listening that things is right on time
[1:13:00] if we'll just believe it
[1:13:02] and listen and think about it that God
[1:13:05] is making itself known to you and I
[1:13:07] through the opening of his word
[1:13:09] he give his word those prophets brought
[1:13:12] that word coming down here comes that
[1:13:15] word walking out in human flesh we call
[1:13:18] him Jesus here he goes to Calvary
[1:13:20] releases that life and it comes back on
[1:13:23] the day of Pentecost who came back Jesus
[1:13:26] came back in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:29] to live in you and I all right and then
[1:13:33] for a little bit in the last days he's
[1:13:34] the return according to Malachi 4 in the
[1:13:37] scriptures and that he was to return as
[1:13:39] son of man all right that God would be
[1:13:45] in human flesh again now not just one we
[1:13:48] don't believe brother Branham was God we
[1:13:50] teach nothing like that we're we're not
[1:13:52] stupid little idiots but not stupid we
[1:13:54] don't believe that that he was God we
[1:13:58] have no point of all of that he was the
[1:14:00] messenger that God sin just like Martin
[1:14:03] Luther was a messenger that God sent
[1:14:04] John Wesley was a messenger that God
[1:14:07] sent you know many
[1:14:09] many of those coming down coming through
[1:14:12] the Baptist and the times I knew a
[1:14:14] little bit about some of the the things
[1:14:17] and and and how that it would be you had
[1:14:20] those people in line coming through to
[1:14:23] bring the message all right and see it's
[1:14:26] nothing it's not something new it's just
[1:14:29] understanding and see everybody knows
[1:14:33] that we believe God sent a prophet
[1:14:34] that's all right that's to fulfill the
[1:14:36] scripture you know but that's okay
[1:14:39] that's no problem but we don't make him
[1:14:41] God thing that's not that away because
[1:14:45] we're we're trying to be right about it
[1:14:47] he brought a message you know John the
[1:14:51] Baptist come to introduce the Messiah
[1:14:54] right and he said behold the lamb of God
[1:14:57] who takes away the sin of the world the
[1:14:59] great man John the Baptist to work he
[1:15:01] was well yet he wasn't God there's no
[1:15:04] man to be guard outside the Lord Jesus
[1:15:06] Christ and He gave His life the word
[1:15:12] that it could come back and live in you
[1:15:13] and I to reveal himself to us and reveal
[1:15:17] himself as does three sons named son of
[1:15:21] God so I mean son of man son of God son
[1:15:24] of David alright we went through the
[1:15:26] point we're picking this up for this
[1:15:28] afternoon we went through the point of
[1:15:30] understanding that according to Malachi
[1:15:33] 4 just for a little while right in the
[1:15:34] end time he's to come back as son of man
[1:15:37] because you cannot go to son of David in
[1:15:39] the millennium coming from the baptism
[1:15:42] of the Holy Ghost because no matter what
[1:15:43] you think when we get out of here those
[1:15:45] Jews is gonna have to receive Christ as
[1:15:47] their Savior if they're going to be
[1:15:50] anywhere they're gonna have to receive
[1:15:51] Christ all right same as we had to
[1:15:54] receive Christ okay all right and see
[1:15:57] then as they'll receive him as Christ
[1:15:59] the Son of the Living God through two
[1:16:02] prophets standing there they'll see that
[1:16:05] the Lord Jesus Christ is the son of man
[1:16:08] but those two people standing there
[1:16:09] won't be God then there's me two
[1:16:14] prophets coming which is Moses and
[1:16:15] Elijah coming to the Jews after we leave
[1:16:17] all right that won't be they are not God
[1:16:22] they're just like it's a vessel that God
[1:16:24] has used but Jesus was that Almighty God
[1:16:28] he said unless you believe that I am he
[1:16:31] who the one that was got to come and
[1:16:34] give his life etc all have been pretty
[1:16:36] but he said unless you believe that I am
[1:16:37] he you will die in your sins I see then
[1:16:41] that way we know the who is the the god
[1:16:44] of glory and his name is Jesus so you
[1:16:48] can run in back as I said a moment ago
[1:16:49] you can go back through the Jehovah you
[1:16:51] can go through the many titles and and
[1:16:53] times of going back but I love the way
[1:16:56] the Bible I'm not against the Jehovah
[1:16:59] Witnesses I just studied the Word of God
[1:17:01] and I can't help it if I remember it but
[1:17:03] I had one talk and tell me one time you
[1:17:05] don't need talking about
[1:17:06] well Jehovah's his name I said well now
[1:17:10] first off your hope was not a name I
[1:17:12] said Jehovah was the title well he
[1:17:16] didn't because he'd never been said that
[1:17:18] to him you know and I said it's the
[1:17:20] title cuz then you got Jehovah Jireh
[1:17:23] jehova rapha jehova kiss goodness you
[1:17:26] got seven compound names of Jehovah and
[1:17:28] they ever won't apply to Jesus Christ
[1:17:30] well he was just backing up this young
[1:17:33] guy he's really interesting huh and I
[1:17:35] said what now what I like is the way the
[1:17:38] truth of it I said you're saying his
[1:17:39] name is Jehovah and I just wrote one
[1:17:42] scripture over in the Old Testament
[1:17:43] where it says by my name Jehovah was I
[1:17:47] never known he looked at me and he said
[1:17:52] I never thought of that
[1:17:54] I said cause his name's not Jehovah
[1:17:57] that's a title that's like I am Rose of
[1:18:01] Sharon lily of the valley the bright and
[1:18:03] morning star that's a title to a name
[1:18:06] but I said Jesus is his name and I said
[1:18:11] what you got has got you you got it turn
[1:18:12] because it really is j vh b rj v hu and
[1:18:18] the reason there's no vowels in there to
[1:18:20] bring it on out so they made it out to
[1:18:21] java we're putting the vowels into the
[1:18:24] letter and of its j v HD or j vh you
[1:18:26] they use it both ways and that is so
[1:18:30] sacred until when they're trying to
[1:18:32] write the bible they take a bath before
[1:18:35] they'll
[1:18:35] that word that means God they'll go take
[1:18:39] a bath they say that's really correct me
[1:18:41] in in the order of one that that Lazarus
[1:18:44] he was a scribe and that he had took so
[1:18:47] many baths till he died of pneumonia
[1:18:49] you know because every time they come to
[1:18:51] that that part is so sacred until they
[1:18:54] won't touch it till they go wash and get
[1:18:56] clean and every time we see if we'd be a
[1:18:58] little bit better off we you know we'd
[1:18:59] be better off if we've got a little more
[1:19:01] cleaner sometimes in ourselves and to
[1:19:03] think about Jesus his name was Jesus he
[1:19:09] said I come in my father's night so the
[1:19:10] father's name would be Jesus he said we
[1:19:13] have is your Jesus only no no no no no
[1:19:16] Jesus only won't work no more than the
[1:19:18] Trinity's work though Jesus only ends
[1:19:21] with Jesus in manifestation that's their
[1:19:25] terminologies when that Jesus is the
[1:19:27] life manifestation of God I differ with
[1:19:29] them the bride of Jesus Christ is the
[1:19:30] life's manifestation of God before we
[1:19:33] walk out of here off of this earth we
[1:19:35] are the life manifestation of God then
[1:19:37] God turns to the Jews and they'll be the
[1:19:39] manifestation of God upon the earth
[1:19:41] it'll be Christ in them this is Christ
[1:19:43] in you the hope of glory you see what
[1:19:46] I'm talking about see then where would
[1:19:48] we be without understanding the term our
[1:19:52] thoughts of three sons name he said well
[1:19:56] this is son of man son of God son of
[1:19:59] David well how can you go from I can
[1:20:01] understand going from Son of man to Son
[1:20:04] of God because He gave His life to do
[1:20:06] that but how are you going to go to son
[1:20:08] of David no son of David is a natural
[1:20:11] King he literally Jesus will be
[1:20:13] literally sitting on the throne of David
[1:20:15] won't be at the throne it'll be in terms
[1:20:18] of using it but manifesting himself to
[1:20:21] show who he is
[1:20:22] that he's the one that they worship see
[1:20:27] then you've got to bring in that and
[1:20:29] there's work that we understand the
[1:20:30] prophet and the message of the age and
[1:20:32] what he would bring to it and we get
[1:20:34] those thoughts from the fact that in
[1:20:36] between son of God and son of David he
[1:20:40] returns his son of man and manifest
[1:20:44] itself as son of man for a little while
[1:20:47] here in the last days
[1:20:48] until that becomes into the son of man
[1:20:51] being the bride of Jesus Christ walking
[1:20:53] on earth again not just a prophet not
[1:20:56] just one person it's God dwelling in
[1:20:59] mankind getting ready for it to step on
[1:21:02] over into the millennial reign all right
[1:21:05] but now here's for a second so wake up
[1:21:11] the to understand son of man son of God
[1:21:15] son of David it's great that's the three
[1:21:20] sons 9 but to understand the son of man
[1:21:23] son of God son of man son of David
[1:21:25] gettin picked up another God you hadn't
[1:21:28] picked up another cell you just picked
[1:21:29] up another manifestation you just picked
[1:21:33] up something god is revealing because
[1:21:36] remember that's not the end of it the
[1:21:40] millennium is the seventh day out of
[1:21:41] Eden that's time
[1:21:43] son of David is not the life form that
[1:21:47] God reveals himself has to be he's
[1:21:52] revealed yourself in Bride phone right
[1:21:53] but that's not the last form what's he
[1:22:01] gonna be in the future home the son of
[1:22:06] David in the millennium what's it going
[1:22:07] to be in the future home I'm trying to
[1:22:10] lay something down for your thoughts
[1:22:11] come on I told you I back up and then a
[1:22:14] pull up line of all right line up with
[1:22:17] the rest of it there's got to be another
[1:22:20] form of God another making known of God
[1:22:25] because in the future home it's gonna be
[1:22:33] a different world
[1:22:37] and what is he gonna reveal itself ash
[1:22:44] gotta have another forum gotta have a
[1:22:48] way to make yourself known remember we
[1:22:51] still believe the Bible whether you like
[1:22:54] it or not the Bible said God is a spirit
[1:22:56] and they that worship Him must worship
[1:22:57] Him in spirit and truth
[1:22:58] so remember he'll never change from
[1:23:00] being a spirit huh he didn't change
[1:23:08] there being spirit when he came into
[1:23:09] that flesh he just moved into a realm
[1:23:15] where he could be made manifest he just
[1:23:19] was brought into a position to where he
[1:23:22] could manifest himself in another out
[1:23:24] another manifestation well son of
[1:23:30] David's not the finality of all of this
[1:23:37] okay this afternoon we'll pick up on
[1:23:40] that and go on for a little bit and see
[1:23:44] cuz he's got to be something where are
[1:23:47] who is what what's he doing in the
[1:23:49] future home in the future home are we
[1:23:57] gonna go up to heaven one day like we
[1:23:58] always used to think we're Trinitarians
[1:24:00] you know and I'm not joking about it I'm
[1:24:02] not making light of them I'm just
[1:24:03] telling it like it was and way we talk
[1:24:05] alright plain language is southern we
[1:24:09] used to say well we get up to heaven
[1:24:10] we'll see
[1:24:11] Jesus sitting on the throne the father
[1:24:14] be sitting over here and the Holy Ghost
[1:24:16] will be fluttering over here like a dove
[1:24:18] yeah well now how are you gonna do that
[1:24:23] when Jesus said on my father want are
[1:24:29] you gonna do it when the Bible says the
[1:24:30] son himself shouldn't become subject
[1:24:33] we've got scriptures left it we've got a
[1:24:35] cover not trying to make a joke of
[1:24:39] anything but the truth about it we go so
[1:24:43] far in our understanding we get up to
[1:24:44] where we think we understand and then
[1:24:46] when we do here's something else comes
[1:24:48] up
[1:24:51] it's vital to understand some man strong
[1:24:56] God son of man strong David now we got
[1:25:02] to go again son of man son of God son of
[1:25:06] man son of David to the future home that
[1:25:15] God may be all and in all
[1:25:20] a scripture now I'm quoting it to you
[1:25:23] that God may be all and in all the great
[1:25:30] opportunity to try to understand God to
[1:25:32] get away from our terminologies of what
[1:25:35] we think what do you mean God God is the
[1:25:37] if God is that anybody says God well
[1:25:39] then you don't even think see and I said
[1:25:43] God is an object of worship there in
[1:25:53] human flesh would Almighty God not just
[1:25:55] an object of worship the very God
[1:25:58] Himself living on earth eating human
[1:26:01] flesh and he said I and my father are
[1:26:05] one
[1:26:06] and this is what he said he said have
[1:26:08] you seen me they said it's your father
[1:26:11] he said if you've seen me he said you've
[1:26:15] seen the father
[1:26:16] because you'll never see spirit realm
[1:26:22] you'll never see spirit you can't see
[1:26:27] spirit realm and you can't do away with
[1:26:29] the scripture that says God is the
[1:26:31] spirit spirit has to take a form he has
[1:26:36] to in morphe or change his form to work
[1:26:40] that he can manifest himself in a
[1:26:42] different way he we got a long ways to
[1:26:47] go
[1:26:47] a lot to understand take on these things
[1:26:52] come on musicians take on these things
[1:26:58] word is very important this it's our
[1:27:02] only hope or thoughts is to understand
[1:27:06] from him and to walk in the light and to
[1:27:11] know then that we we can fellowship and
[1:27:14] understand the wording how would you
[1:27:17] have felt if you'd have been Peter or
[1:27:19] something is standing there and he just
[1:27:21] said who demands out of the son of man I
[1:27:23] Peter answered what to hold a ghost a it
[1:27:25] because the church was built on the fact
[1:27:27] of son of God being God in human flesh
[1:27:32] giving the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[1:27:36] he said Peter he said I didn't ask you
[1:27:38] that question we said that's all right
[1:27:41] said I'll build my church upon what you
[1:27:44] just say it that I'm the Christ the Son
[1:27:46] of the Living God that word Christ there
[1:27:48] means a great eternal self-existing
[1:27:50] Elohim that comes out of the beginning
[1:27:53] of the logos the theophany all of those
[1:27:55] big terminologies of words that we use
[1:27:57] which is simple God was made manifest to
[1:28:01] where we could understand him moving
[1:28:04] from one form to another until our
[1:28:06] comprehension could comprehend and once
[1:28:08] you see him standing in flesh there he
[1:28:10] is
[1:28:11] you know who that is and what's taking
[1:28:13] place let's stand oh my god of course
[1:28:17] how anybody have a need the altars open
[1:28:19] think on these things
[1:28:21] [Music]
