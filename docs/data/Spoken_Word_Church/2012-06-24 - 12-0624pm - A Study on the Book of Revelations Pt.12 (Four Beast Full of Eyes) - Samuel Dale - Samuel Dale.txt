that s yes sir I know always heard brother Chris had it so we we know he got it now we just pump him to use it that's to do and I really enjoyed it thought it was good amen amen just remember now not just coming in Saturday now but the next Saturday July the 7th will be the Bible study here at the church then the third Saturday July 14th will be the ministers meeting here for the ministers only and I'm sure that if some of you would like to help June uh on that Saturday she will be fixing it don't know how much my wife can do because she got where she got can't do a lot but she'll be trying to help us she can but and the the uh uh two olive trees and and the things we will cover that maybe later but being the two olive trees being the old and the New Testament right and see then but the point of it is it's our journey that I'm want us to see amen now what if you was an Israelite and you could really get over there now and take one of those Jews Israelites you know whatever and you could say do you know that Ezekiel was covering your journey through life all you need is somebody to break these symbols y you see well would be so dangerous for brother brandom to have went to Israel oh yeah let alone the Messiah sign yeah you remember how talked to that man about was the healing of John Ryan and the old man said you can't cut God into three pieces it to Jew he said sir we don't do it amen he turned right around and took the scriptures and laid it back and the man started quoting the scriptures of the New Testament he said he'd been in the book yeah and he said he believed it but see he couldn't accept it right why because it wasn't the hour no but one day all of that will unfold yeah what about when they were going down there you know to come back to Israel they wouldn't get on them airplanes to fly home right they was out there digging they didn't know what an airplane was probably never seen one they were out there digging for a living they CT him down tried to get him on the plane you remember they wouldn't get on they Rabbi got up and he said God said we'd fly home on the wings of an eagle there it sits they crawled on y they ready to go home y see it become a reality to them right what do you think about when you would get to the Homeland and and there you would they asked them said you coming home to die no we're coming home to see the Messiah amen that's been 40 something years ago yep but you know it was real to them right yeah they cherish that citizenship so much until if your mother or daddy either one was a Jew you can go right over now and get an Israeli citizenship that's y they don't question you all you got to show that you you got to St come from a Jewish y if that could be that much about a natural Nation what can you and I be about the word of God right we've had 40 something years to argue around orb fuss about the seals the Thunders the plagues the the two Souls is all kind of doctrines I think it's about time to head to the promised land amen that's right that's right you know I think it's about time to realize we're in the promised land amen remember now this is not just a type of the in glory you know to Glory but it is a scene of when we will actually get there right yep that's what I'm trying to get you to see y we're not there right now now come on John goes up in a top you know what he does he has to look back down here and see what we're doing come on you say well that was that was God taking him into the future okay that's good but you know the future can't be any good unless this present time is correct right sure amen so now let's get down to think about it the scene in heaven that we look at is now being played out and has been 2,000 years you're on Earth these combat beasts the lon the oxim man the eagle they had their place here on Earth if I don't choose to get back to it I don't know how fast I'm going but you know brother ROM go into the message I'll be glad to give you the books he covers Matthew Mark Luke and John that's right as the come back this guarding the book of Acts right amen the book of of Acts is not the guarding the Matthew Mark Luke and John he was getting it backwards right the book of Acts is guarded by that's right Matthew Mark luk and John you remember how he brought it you read over in Acts you know repent everyone to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we can go back to the gospels and find out what that name is right did they guard it all see then down down Through the Ages just say this then we'll read most of it down Through the Ages you had the line lasted for so long and then you had the Dark Ages come along that was the ox right then you had the man under Luther Wesley Knox finny all of those smart screw y man just like Brother Richard said the other day on T remember each one of those combat Beast is Earthly y That's right yes sir L the ox man the eagle Eagle's the only one that's the Heavenly bird and we better believe as I was trying to express while ago if we can believe all of those others were the people were the combat Beast under their messenger why can't we believe we're the combat beast that's right under our messenger amen you know how I answer people when I'm talking talking to I'm talking to somebody there discussing one God Etc or something you know how I answer I don't say brother R said so and so right they don't know who he is and don't care amen but you know what I'm doing I'm just running through my mind while they talk and I'm remembering what brother R said to those people right when he talked to them correct right that's the best answer MH if it conquered Satan one time they conquer him again right well that would be a good way of doing it right now listen so the scene we're looking at in heaven cuz that's what brother R says about Revelation 5 I actually got to quote that in here where he said this is a scene this is not a verse but verse he's talking about the fifth chapter not a verse by verse he said he said it's a scene you know what a scene is comes across the screen it's got something on it's showing it to you all right this is the bride sitting in her position in glory all right that's fine we're looking at that but now let's get to our position right and don't put us there because we can read it there right people say the seals is broke to brother brandom they broke to me well tell me what they are I I they just they broke to brother brandom yeah well that's good but what about you right man what about you what what's broke to you what can you see well I I I I just St when a glory to God I try my best to stay with what brother rown said that's what I've been trying to do for 40 something years right that's why I keep preaching the same thing over and over just I don't worry about it but let's get down to it now the Throne of God that you look at in Revelations 4:1 and all those things up to the tribulation part where it's the Thunders and the Lightnings it had its beginning here right it actually started here that's why brother R when he get to the to the seals he would say this is not to the bride this is to Israel but we will look back and see where it came from that's what he was doing right so you say well the for the first seal Antichrist it's Antichrist well where did he come from right how' he get to be the Antichrist you know that that was so deceiving until they wouldn't but one man ever called him the Antichrist until brother random come along and that was John the Revelator that's right they come back from patas y he didn't say it while he was in his own life here in his own Ministry until he went to patmas but when he went to patmas and come back he called it the Antichrist the word Antichrist does not appear until over in the little gospels right Paul called it Grievious wolves he didn't call it Antichrist you see we didn't say first seal Antichrist I thought the seal the seal was the holy spirit amen right and the Antichrist was what's going away from it right but now think about it these combat beasts never started in heaven they started on Earth all right Ezekiel when he saw what he saw that combat Beast to Israel never started in Heaven Keep relating to that for this morning it was Israel in Journey upon Earth so is it now it's it's the bride of Christ the real true Israel in Journey and seeing ourselves seeing how God has dealt down through time through seven churches ages in these ways so now let's watch as the Beast come forth on the earth then we'll be able to see them in heaven after the Rapture but you got number 4,833 when you see those combat beasts in heaven be real careful they are angels and they are angels there are angels that are messengers there are angels that are angels the one scen in Revelations 4:1 are not just the Heavenly angels that are singing holy holy holy Lord God Almighty I would write that down those in Revelations 4:1 are saying holy holy Lord God Almighty right because that's us after the Rapture y worshiping God no no it's just Angel see that's where you tied up you you got your mind locked if these four combat beast on Earth was in the bride of Christ when they get to heaven where are they going to be it's not beast in the bride right come on now we're going to separate something this afternoon this is not just a uh an anointing that comes down upon people that's well and good that's anointed one this is actually the combat Beast are actually the spirit of God Amen in the people that's right amen come on the spirit of God in the people not the spirit of God on the people that's what I'm saying that you you get all that tied together and you get angels angels angels Revelation 4 there it says they worship and GL you know throw their crowns down so they're not Angel right Angels don't have crowns this group of angels are beings I read that to you the other day you listening yes brother said these are beings amen they're not Angels can't you see that when we get there what a worship time we're going to be having am yes and we're not those angels that are going through heaven right now all glory glory glory that's right cuz they was never lost right amen now no crowns to throw at his feet I think it's in there pull it back up brother pull back up on Revelations 4 I want you to read it and the four Beast had each one of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and the rest not day and night saying holy holy Lord God Almighty which he is and was is to come somewhere that they throw their crowns down on down below there I think yeah all right 10 but the Angels don't have crime that's right exactly amen see church trying to look at it to see when we get there it's going to be a wonderful time amen that's right and we'll throw our crowns before him amen and give honor and Glory yes amen you said well what kind of crowns we got well if you have eternal ey that's one Crown yes sir amen but any of our deeds and thoughts and ideas or anything we've done all the preaching of the gospel I've done is worth nothing except for one thing if I've held him up MH then that is a crown that I can lay before his feet and you know what brother around and said he said you'll be my crown is that what he said so then he'll have a crown to put TKE you get a convert to Christ you got a crown are you listening yes we see we're talking about what's on Earth cuz all those crowns and things come to pass because of what we're doing here that's right amen right yes so now we're going to get in a minute two different kind of beasts but I'm trying to separate Angels you got Heavenly angels that have never fallen they can cry holy holy all day but they have no crowns but you got Earthly angels that have been down here on Earth and understand Redemption amen people Angels that's who we are right Messengers you sisters you're Messengers to your children and to your neighbors to the older to the younger y but we're not Angelic beings that's right no we never will be Angelic beings we never will have the hearts and the and the the things we human being amen that's right but we're the Bride of Jesus Christ amen do you know what those Angelic beings that are real Angelic beings will be singing about you that's right amen because you'll be him amen I hope that we get that here now we're not going to be dealing everybody understand everybody waking up just understand the point yes we are not going to be dealing this afternoon with the opening of the seals I have to talk about it because it's so interrelated right but we're not going to be dealing with the opening of the seals right because let me quote brother Brandon the seals are opened in glory that's right no the seals are opened in glory we saw what happen we're seeing what happened 2,000 years ago in glory but you better remember something else the Thunders don't sound in heaven that's right right amen I'm quoting brother brandom the thunder sound on Earth amen the Thunder is the voice of God when the seal breaks is that right 155 long in there seal book first seal you say well that's just confus why does it confuse you CU we're going to go up and see Happ that's right we're able to go up by spiritual Revelation right now in a resurrect sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and be able to look and see what will happen to Israel when we get out of here we know the names of the two witnesses Moses and Elijah we don't know how many there'll be 144,000 we're not tied up in all those doctrines and things that's Russ light and this is that and this is no we know what it is why because we read the book amen and we see it yes so we're not dealing with the opening of the seals as we will cover l t but the ride of the Antichrist as the Theon Beast riding on earth and the combat Beast the zoom the o o n as the bride of Christ to combat that you know the bride of Christ is the combat Beast sure oh no no Jesus well anybody got any sense you don't I ain't going to argue with you I'm sorry if you can't figure out it I'm talking about the bride bride being Christ made manifest in each age you got a problem in your mentality that's right the best way I can say it amen I'm talking about a revelation of Jesus Christ and where he's at he's in his people he's been in his people but you know what his people's him that's right amen now you going to swallow there is no combat beast in God without a person on Earth for that to work through right sure oh yeah God do anything he want to he can't go contrary to his word when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard who in right sure who combed them things that's what I want you to read with me who combat it down to the ages the people that's right who's com back the Antichrist now right right no we ain't got an Christ now we you better wake up amen the biggest Antichrist that could ever be is here now right cuz it's taking brother R's message and twisting it and telling you things it well brother R was wrong here we know he missed this and we can't understand that come on this is the worst deception of all folks amen my brother R said it wouldn't have been no problem to walk up and give you life for the gospel right he said that would have just been simply aive right but when we're down here facing it on every hand and them people right over there in that denominational Church ain't bothering me and you right if that is we got a problem folk it's the Antichrist among the people of this message right amen that's right we'll read it the minute where brother around says even that spirit that was down there charging for prayers he said it was in the preachers in the last days pulling for money oh you find out where people's at in the hurry when you get into money that's an easy way to find out where somebody's at is just get into their finan of fire and it ain't Dave Ramsey but listen Church we're going to watch the ride of the Antichrist we'll finish this Wednesday if I don't get so far Qui watch the ride of the anticrist but we're going to be watching the ride of Jesus Christ amen would you see how easy it is to miss it you know that Martin Luther and Wesley and all of them was that combat Beast sure those people in that day was that combat Beast you I don't see how like to be because they're trinitarians I don't see how in the world you and you and I ever got where we're at anyway what are we mixed up garbage cans right they Outcast the scum of the earth you said don't throw off on me like that I'm not God if you don't believe you're all scaring the scum of the earth you're not even what I'm talking about that's right amen I like that scripture where it says they went out from us cuz they wouldn't of us you know that's what the bad you said when I left you know this right went out from CU would know them been know I'd stayed I had to do it two times this message know all right so let's just start reading but let's see what these combat beats really are go ahead brother B I think he's on post today look what brother R says on the fifth seal now I ask you to just read the fifth seal you're going to read a big portion of you here but I just ask you to read it this is 1963 322 the fifth seal paragraph 88 the four stages of his writer has been revealed now you know what he means by that cuz he's been he's done preached four SE and this is the thft there's no combat beast on the thft you don't have to have one because the L one was The Eagle right the four stages of the Antichrist riter has been revealed at this time look at it the four stages of the Antichrist the four stages of the Antichrist as well as this four stages of Jesus Christ and you know what people this message will say four is a number of antichrist and they won't have Jesus Christ to have four they only have to have three you better read uh what is it uh slipping I'll get it in a minute where brother M explains the the theorm palor locus caterpillar uh brid tree restoration he covers four that right he covers justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word amen amen but four is Antichrist number four Jesus Christ number two amen I a't having that for Antichrist I've been taught that all my life well all your life you've been wrong there was four living creatures of God to announce the writer as they wrote four Beast or four powers now we know that Beast by interpretation of the terms of the Bible symbols means power now let's get that close the four be four are beast in the Bible represent the power among the people right I didn't say Mr the church age messenger only right among the people all right now if we find out like in Daniel when he saw a certain Nation rise up it would be maybe a bar holding a rib in his side symbol then he seen another Power raise up goat and it represented something then he seen another Power raise up up and and it was a leopard with so many heads it represented certain Kingdom then he saw another one rise up and a great Lon with the teeth and the STP the residue that represented a different Power representing what a different Power all together see coming down one was a was a kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar and another type because you remember the dream of Daniel coming down in his his dreams and all was correct but what is it it's a power among the people right now there are two different kind of beast in the Book of Revelation go ahead and pull up the next one cuz we got a we got a 1 a 2 a 2 a all right there's two different kinds of Beast you say well I know that that's right but these people out here on some of these ain't never heard some of maybe cuz maybe they're this year in the first time and they don't know so maybe it's interest in people enough to do it and if you say you know all about it then you're the person I'm talking about you don't know all about okay you hurt my feelings good we'll do some praying amen it'll help why you there pray for me all right Revelation chapter 4 I just pull this part off because it was a long reading and it goes ahead and describes a beast which we'll get to in a minute now the Beast here is represented have you got a marginal reading in your Bible on on Beast if you have get over in the marginal reading the notice Dr Scofield here has it marked out in his the Beast means he's got over here saying living creatures oh my now watch the Greek word there is z o o m r o r z o n it is zou now in the Greek it's called Zoom which means a creature now it isn't so if you want to read it now we haven't got time I was going to read it but I haven't put down but I have it put down Revelations 1113 now he's giving you this one this is zoom all right Revelations 11131 17 where there where Beast is the chapters in Revelations 11 13117 is called the beast the same way but the Beast dire interpretation is t h e r i o n Theon the word Greek word there Theon which means means a wild untameable beast y now we're talking about the combat Beast the two different ones the zoom is the bride now what's a simple answer to this Theon now get ready to get your feelings hurt because of what he says but you're going to get it hurt in him all right watch it the Greek word Theon which means a wild Untamed Beast Theon that means a wild unimed beast and zoon means a creature see four living Zoom creatures not the Beast of wild Theon but Zoom living creatures and Theon is wild Untamed Savages oh that's over in Africa back in them jungles man you just see them you can see them Indians out y you can just see them up y uh come on you done read it probably before I get to it anyway and Theon is wild un Savages in other words if you watch the 11th chapter the Beast of Rome the 13th chapter the United States y the 17th chapter both United States and Rome of the denominational churches Consolidated with the ca Catholicism making them an unconverted Untamed to the gospel pleas Untamed now boy you ain't got big old Savages there has you they sitting in churches right amen denominationalism that's right tying together with Catholicism and he calls him a Theon that's what the Bible calls him a Theon untameable unconverted he says right amen but now those are good people brother Dale amen right y that ain't got anything to do with Christianity right think about it how simple a prophet can make it that's what these Theon beasts are yep huh how about in this message how many the UN beast in this message are untimed unconvertible well brother Dale you're just so hard-headed I agree with you ain't got no problem but now there's just one Bible there's just one truth now if I'm off that you come and show me if I miss that you come and show me where I missed you amen but if not my blood's on you right I've never had anybody yet on the internet all the way around I'm sure this open it up they'll do it one of these days that's all right never had one time on the internet since we've been doing it for somebody to really challenge me on what I've taught sure a brother challenged me and said I didn't know I didn't understand what this other brother T I just quoted what he said say it and I've never answered the man back and will not because I'm not going to argue over internet now if he wants to come to my home I'll be glad to talk to him be sure I would I would love for him to come just sit down and talk with me a few days you know but I'm not going to argue with nobody about what this is or that is but come and show me where I'm off the word amen I ain't talking about what I would misunderstand what some brother had said on a tape don't show me where I'm off the scripture you say well that make you something no but it makes a great God 40s something years and we don't know what brother randam has taught yeah come on that's right what's the matter what have you been reading that's right come on church now let's start reading okay we're going to be reading from the fifth seal so we'll just start with paragraph 113 and we're going to be reading for quite a while there will be a few little Scouts in it but not much they do I'll tell you when it changes okay paragraph 113 1963 322 fifth seal notice as the Antichrist went forth on his Beast of ministry there God sent forth a beast to combat it now once then every time the Beast rode on his horse the Antichrist rode on his horse on his Beast to announce his ministry God sent forth his Beast also in his own mask I love that to announce his combat to it i' underline that announce to about two Services down now the scripture says when the enemy you say you say things so once in a while just off the top of your hat if you write them top of the hats down you might find out one of these days I really meant I wish you'd write that down it may Happ you now the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raised standard against and so when the enemy went out as an antichrist God sent a certain type of power out to meet him and then when they he went out again as a red horse rider another color another Power another Ministry God sent another one after him to combat it to combat it to hold his church remember that sent the third one again God sent his third Beast to come and to announce it see that will cover when we get in the seal announce the opening of the seal he sent the fourth one God sent his fourth one and then the Antichrist in and the church ages ended to it at that time oh watch this is really good now we go up to 119 I said most of these are continual reading now we see that the devil changing four before Beast meant that what power they was revealed to the what power he revealed to the world now he's talking about the devil revealing a power not talking about God revealing a power y he revealed the world and how they ended on this pale de horse oh let's look at God's power of these beasts to combat them the first Beast of God that went out to meet the Antichrist was the the Antichrist Spirit when it said it's just his teaching now remember when the Antichrist first wrote he was in a Teaching Ministry the Antichrist first roote in a Teaching Ministry and watch the one that went out to meet him the lion the lion of the tribe of Judah which is the word when the false teaching went forth the true word went out to meet him that's the reason we had an irenius and a polycar you notice he ain't Nam Paul yet it's a combat among the people that's my point see and those fell St Martin when that Antichrist was writing with his false teaching God sent his teaching out the word the line of the tribe of Judah which is the word made manifest in the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit there to manifest himself which is the word that's the reason the early church had healings and miracles and visions and power is because it was the Living Word in the in the form of the line of the tribe of Judah riding out to combat that amen now you got it he sends his power Antichrist God sends his power the word Antichrist false teaching the true teaching went with it to combat it now that was the first one now this was the first church Apostolic that went to meet him so if you just follow the paragraph down now the second beast that the Antichrist sent out was a red Beast which was a that he wrote on was to take peace from the earth and War you going to see a book you find out it was killing you know and that's when the 68 million started to be killed of the Bride not the the Jews now that was 6 million Jews that was killed by and Hitler in war now the second one that went to combat him was the ox Beast the o means a labor a beast of burden now if we just stop just a minute let me get let just so you be sure to meet this that's the kind might that's that's the kind might be a little puzzling to you let us get T Tara over here watch and see if it isn't a a laboring church all right now look back behind do you see where tar is at the four Church age all right now that's where you're op and you start losing 68 million starts being killed it was killed down before then so then your line Ministry liced three Church agents right yes as a matter of fact in the four Church ages when the lon Ministry went into the ground that was your corn of wheat that was falling into the ground y that was what Jesus speaking of let's a corn of whe Di and fall into the ground and ab alone right that pure unadulterated word brother Brown said there was nobody greater than under standing than St Martin outside of Paul himself right St Martin had signs in wonders in his church the dead raised the sick healed and wouldn't be satisfied himmer Columbo one wouldn't be satisfied until everybody in the church had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and signs and wonders followed so the pure under alterated word lasted for ages and started going into the ground at Tiara as an ox right that's why it changed to an oxx because it it became out in the Dark Ages the where that they were killing in the thing going up paragraph 129 see that shows that the Taran age after the Antichrist got settled down and it came into a Taran age the little church could do nothing but just just simply labor and another thing the ox is a also is a beast of sacrifice see they gave their life just as freely as they could give them in the Dark Ages A Thousand Years D the Catholicism control the world and you just went right in yes or no they didn't mind dying it was death that's all right they went and died anyhow why the SP very Spirit of the age now that's not just a messenger right right first one is the word next one is the ox is not just a man one person right why does everybody want to go to the end of it and just say brother around I'm the evil we could here in just a minute when brother around said when the Eagles th Roll come he uses the word Eagles PL cuz I thought we were supposed to be Eagles I thought we were supposed to be little Messiah I thought we had a certain position watch what I watch when he gets into this now the very Spirit of the age that's the reason then that's the reason irus that's reion polycarp John Paul those great mighty men out there combating that thing Paul saw it he said I know that after my departing that wolves are going to enter in among you Brethren teaching reverse things it'll draw you away all right 131 keep going so it's just a continuation we just keep reading you just read the paragraph number and you'll stay right where we're at just go jumps over to paragraph 140 now and I'm going to set this box up here to represent that if God sends a certain Spirit among them that's the only thing that they can work by is the spirit that works among them that's right he said those people in the Dark Ages they give their life freely that's right cuz that was the spirit right amen you realize if they hadn't went to the ground we wouldn't be here that's right that's right if they hadn't to went the ground we wouldn't be here right you know you know Jesus Jesus is the word that's who they were and we'll prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose what exactly the church rep responded to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else that's right we can't help being what we are that's right you know I mean you may think that we're against organized religion we're against the denominated no we're the only people that's not against them they're against each other fighting like crazy now I admit now % of the preachers this Mage is them denomination is fighting yeah come on right but it's ain't called Methodist and Baptist but I'm not fighting against nobody I want to see everybody amen but I just know they can't that's right but if they don't have the new birth they can't see what you're talking about that's right that's why it's no good to argue the first was the line that roared that pure and adulterating word the second in tar was the o and it was a burden a beast of burden pardon me and it was also a sacrificial beast and wasn't that exactly the poor little Church of Rome that settled down there to A Thousand Years of Dark Ages and anything that didn't profess to be the Roman Church was put to death immediately and they had labor go from place to place all right we jump to 145 let just continue they didn't care because the spirit of the church in that day was sacrificing we got that no no they didn't care because the spirit of the church in that day was sacrifice labor and they walked up just as freely as they could walk Anointed with the true spirit of God of that age and died like Heroes of sacrifice thousands times thousands 68 million of them on the record o sacrifice that's the catholic's on record that's right oh my do you understand it okay all right now the sacrifice it only could labor in that age to comeb back the great opposition for that 1,000 years now the third Beast that went from the devil was this black horse now remember Theon black horse right see now the third Beast that went out power from God to combat him come back the powers of the black horse was a man cunning smart with the wisdom of God you know a man is the smarter than any of the Beast see he's smarter cuz he can outwit him mostly he's cunning RW and he's the the age from the Dark Age now coming out from the Dark Age down to this other side where this black horse was riding when they charged for their their their sacrifice and everything they done and money was just oh you know how it was now the next when out to combat that was a beast with the face of a man smart educated shrewd fine Anointed with that Spirit of that day you notice he went to combat him with a kindness of God's wisdom with him y that was the age of the Reformation Martin Luther John Wesley and so forth it was the reformation ziggle and oh who all Knox Calvin and who all see went out and it was cunningness brother Brenham you know how Calvin was a rascal had a man put to death for leaving in but yet he still in there right sure you said oh he's not you going to argue with God about it because there was no way to understand in that day right amen all right you just fuss with him not with me watch from the Dark Age of reformation this way it was the shrewdness of man but notice it was a shrewdness of man now do you understand the third Beast that Satan went out he become shrew too now here Satan right a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny oh oh my see oh my see the money-making scheme the shrewdness to get the gold of the world and the wealth brought into it like Terence told us we were all dummies when we come in this message gold was probably $35 an ounce you realize if You' have made a $11,000 investment at $35 an ounce now it's what between $6 $1,800 an ounce we just wouldn't smart enough we should have put everything we had in gold now we got it all in paper yeah you know paper burns yeah gold on yeah Bank notes all in okay get out of it the moneymaking scheme the r is to get the gold of the world and the wealth brought into it that's exactly the full field that's what begin to charge for prayers and for make a place called purgatory and prayed their ancestors out and are you had to will your deeds and everything your property the church and it was state was the same and the church taking your property over and don't you see some of these evangelists now how many of you have ever been recognized or noted some of your families maybe you've done it but these preachers that come on there the big names you know that's their business but they get you to pledge amen that was one thing that was never brought up in the Baptist Church I was in I wish it had a been I pledge right now that I would have been highly upset and I would have told him about it right I did tell him about it I took up the offer and counted the money and I told the Deacon board in the Deacon meeting that there was more tith due out of the deacon board than what was coming in the offering play upstairs sure you think I'm tough now about things I told him then about it I said that means some of you ain't paying your tithes right pledge you to do it what happens what happens if you don't meet your pledge now we're supposed to be Christians right I mean we're supposed to be Christians right now brother collie you know you pledge to give $100 a week right okay sign this pledge now I'm a Christian so next week you don't pledge I thought let's let's pray for brother col he has made his pledge just wake Donnie would you contact me see why he had made this play if you need some take help with you now now come on folks don't tell me it don't work if they don't do it why would have have I ever done any of you for money did Brother ever done anybody for money did the Lord Jesus ever done anybody for money you say well that's in the denominations they get you the pledge how many of you come out of churches where your pastor said you got to pay $20 a week offering let alone your tithe right now a lot of you quiet right now right some was a whole lot more than that brother in this message not loving wonderful brother he say I take a $100 from a widow woman as quick as I would a millionaire come on right needing their homes you ever been in church where they pass the offering PL twice yes I'm known of it passing three times right but you know what them big old boys is passing the place driving C well you got one brother there 2,000 model is gift to me I thank God for it you get my point is it not in this message sure why is the preacher preach on TI oh brother boy M got some tickle at me I never preached on tithing in my life only time I preached on tithing boy told his daddy said there's one thing about it my in church where we're going to you won't hear him preaching about TI the only time the man came and I preached on TI but I preach on tithing your time and your talents and your things right right but if I got to say something to you about paying your tithe forgive it yeah that's right Church ain't never been build on but other people is buil on what God will give us you don't believe it all notice the Beast come to come back it was Martin Luther and the different but where where was it don't you see those evangelists this day would still have the same anointing on this day still have the same anointing on them making old people give up their pensions and needing their homes over to certain things my brother I I don't want to get on that he said it was the same anointing y right now that's hard to think about isn't it the same thing that would make a preacher pull for money you know that brother random fired campaign managers because they pull for money that's right you want me to get back there and find some names for you he fired them because they pull for money that's right these were preachers especially one of them we just think about it that shrewd anointing we're sitting in a church one time and this brother got up took up and offered brother Woodby he knew all about those type of things CU he'd been down through there that man hadn't sent five words and all of you know his name personally but he said five words and brother Wy plucked me in the ribs that he knows what he's doing I said you watching we said in a meeting up at Ruth one time and a man got up there and got $10,000 in one offering you don't known how to pull oh no we're not the days now when they threaten to burn your Barns and and your Stop's going to die and you no well we we don't do that but what's the difference in seven tenants and things that's right right do you understand yes this was on the Antichrist anointing down through there and it's still here now but remember the Antichrist gets off of one horse gets on another one he on end he gets off that horse gets on another you know that horse don't die and go away that horse just follows him up follows him up at the end he's riding on all four horses that's right right that's right he riding them all down the entr what you think about okay right the Beast come to combat there was a man and we allow that this Beast of man this power of man in his intellectuals recognize that that kosher that Martin Luther had in his hand when he was climbing those steps he said this is the body of the Lord Jesus this is the the blood of the Lord of Jesus Jus Christ this is the body of Jesus Christ and Luther throw it down and said it's Bread and Wine it's not the body of Christ because he been exalted to the right hand it was a man did that come out under amen a shrewdness of a man John Wesley come along after zingle and come in and Calvin and he got and he got the church to a place on security that they didn't want any more revivals Y no Revol turn over worldwide is right we agree but not in your heart right no way I'm in a Revival stay in one whatever is going to be is going to be that was all of it you know if they got so bad they wouldn't take their kids to church because they afraid they might get converted when God didn't want him to be you know that's a Baptist Doctrine more less the the independent afraid they might get saved when God didn't want to save them now ain't that D I try to get away use that word stupid that's right they just lived any kind of lives the Lutheran Church was so twisted and the England Church oh my the whole country became corrupt now this is what under a combat be just like it is now a church is Twisted when King Henry the the E come into England and after Bloody Mar and all of these things take place and then the church was so full of violence and Corruption men claiming Christianity and living with four or five wives are doing anything they wanted to do and crying on in filth and what it come back John Wesley studying the scripture and watching it it was revealed to him that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies the believer amen and you shouldn't then what did he do he come out with another Reformation he saved the world in his day like Luther did what was it the man be power going on he G the wisdom of understanding that the thing is wrong right keep on going where we at on let's just cut it off there because we'll do this one but we'll cut it off notice how Satan shely pulled that we see at that time upon the man's being God put a spirit wisdom upon man to understand that's wrong now that was to combat the third Beast that had got the church so corrupt that he was writing that it was terrible the reformers what did they do then they in the reformers age they brought the church from its pagan ceremonies of idolatry back to God again see that's what the Beast went on and the kindness of man riding to do it all right let's cut off right there because if I keep on we get into the to the eagle with is it's too late it's sorry 5 to 4 I didn't mean to go that long but listen we'll review a little bit and pick up Wednesday night these combat beasts that you read in Revelations 4 they cast their throne their crowns you know the things before the one on the throne they're not the Angelic beings that fly through Heaven just singing Holy Holy Holy they're the ones that came from Earth that really know how to worship and which one do you think God would want to hear crying holy holy holy right now there's Angels around him how that means I don't understand surely they're not just holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy now brother George Canada had a good point one time and I agree with it was a good point he said you know they said them Angels they look at him they say holy holy holy he said didn't they see him said they see something exra about him you know greater and they say holy holy holy said every time they say it said they see something greater that's wonderful and that could go on for millions of years but you know what sister Gail God had rather hear you and I and our squeaky old worn out voices sister G used to sing like a LK she still can but kind of gets broke up sometime you know but God would rather hear that than hear all those other Angels that's correct because they don't know how to sing Holy Holy Holy no it's only the one who's been to Earth and realize how sinful we are amen that's right that we can cry holy holy holy Lord God Almighty amen true if you hadn't to come where would we be if you hadn't paid the price where would we be yes won't be no problem then will they right let's Stand Together come on Brothers I'll pick it up Wednesday and just continue the thought on cuz I think you're getting the point of what I want you to see the combat Beast is in the people right it's the spirit of God Among the people yep that's manifesting itself and in doing that then we're part of it so when we read Wednesday we get down to where brother R said when the Eagles plural come many Eagles come man years ago he said brother Rand just come to make way for the prophets you know what I didn't get mad at him because he said that I'd read the book but when I questioned him about what he was talking about yeah brother how can remember we were sitting out at the old blue Bo Cafe and come find out the man wound up believing a gentile bride and a gentile Prophet would be the two witnesses go to Israel of course you know who the Gentile Prophet was him so I just told him I said according to the Bible and according to brother randam God will only receive two prophets that are Jews that's right mhm he said you don't believe it could be a gentile bride and a gentile Prophet I said no sir don't believe it see church at least we could combat brother R said I'll be glad the time comes that they'll look people in the eye and say you're not saying what Paul said now what was he saying no would you think he was speaking there ought to be a Time come that somebody would say you ain't saying what brother R saying but the ones that ain't saying what brother around and said are more popular yeah because that's the spirit in them that's right that's the spirit in them it's the spirit in the people remember Brother Gary was here he'd say Amen to this you know that Beast can only do is give him power that's right that zoom zoom which is Christ all right but that thron can do nothing if we don't give him our powers so which one we going to give it to that's right go ahead one got amen anybody have a name the anybody have a which Beast are we are we Z or are we they're still Val come and read the for seal that was so amazing when I first read it for the battle of Armageddon and where brother Rand said those Come Those iron needs come from see we always thought it was Russia China etc etc go read the for seal brother R never fired a shot in his thought he never preached a thing about Russia and China them he said them combat Beast to try to comat us comes from Catholic and Protestants oh no no it's Russia and China you know that in World War I when the Germans went to war they had on their belt buckle In God We Trust Catholicism only controls are probably said about 2% so Russians said we'll accept a God that can do those things those are people but them combat Beast read that for seal them combat Beast comes down to battle against the little bride he said there Protestants and Catholics gathering together you know what would happen right now if Russia didn't come down after us it would be Protestants and Catholics because that's what they are in Russia there's Badness Mist Presbyterians Etc see we want to make it some kind of crazy but it's so simple it just transpired we'll never see over we blind the TR through I have already come his PR and be Jesus father and our brother theem it's not in our way
