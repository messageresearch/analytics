this month to M on top give me my Mountain and you'll have to be patient because we don't start at the bottom to the tough but I'll say I know what I did know and Mountain means a landmass that projects come specially above its surroundings and is higher than a hill climbing a mountain of course monsters or work God does mighty things then Berger says in the mark of the beast he said he said I was thinking about one down I love monomers I think about during the Millennium I don't like to spend a few billion gears to roaming around over the mountains just looking around I like that I think about running and just sister up there in there my baby she's been there for a million years walking along this how they get real you know like with a puppy or something but she'll be walking along with a big tiger or something I say how do you do a sister what'd she say your brother branham yeah how do you do sure glad to see you how long do you think now you was counting time that you be out

down so don't say I thought it's supposed to talk about moms okay so don't lose faith show it you're never alone for God on the mountain is still God in the valley see when things go wrong he'll make them right and the god of the good times is still God in the bad times the god of the day is still God in the night we took the faith when we're up on them on but the talk comes easy one life that is best but it's down in the valley of trials and temptation that's when your faith is really put to the test sing a song that's a good so okay we're gonna use the Bible story we're gonna read a lot on the Bible let's go to Genesis 7 we're gonna read the whole chapter on with no voter chapter 8 up to the want to forward on Jeffrey so start in chapter 7 and we're going to do you know the hell gets responsive reading and the Lord said unto Noah come thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation well follow also there by seventh day the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights in Aldie according to all that the LORD commanded him in hominin and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark t cost of the waters of the flood [Applause] there one end to issue another Norma and to the heart the male and the female does God have command that no one in each 600 here of non-violent a second month the seventh day of the month the same day were all that fathers are the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven or open in the sesame day entered Noah and Shem and ham and Japheth the sons of Noah and Noah and wife and the three wives the son with them into the earth and they went in to know off into the park two and two of all flesh where is the fire and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the water increased and bare up the ark and it was lifted above the earth and the waters and the waters were prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both a foul and a cat on and on that beast and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every man all the spread of the lie in every living substance will destroy it which was upon the face of the ground both Man and cattle and the creeping things and they follow of the heaven and they will destroy it from the earth and not only remain alive and then they were with him in the ark and God remember Noah in every little chapter eight first one and God remembered Noah and every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and God made a went to pass over the earth and the waters [Music] and the waters returned from of the earth continually after the end of that 150 days the waters or I was trying to get some help with it with that name but guys go down everything okay now everybody things know was a simple thing like the kids sing who build it or no I'm not it I mean God destroyed everything has said people have learned that art and the handle you know it's not a little more little thing you know when all was $600

eat manna in the wilderness 40 years Jewish men eyes a type of plastic Abraham an intercessor for God God did destroy you know like Sodom and Gomorrah but it's just like a city it's not like the whole world on me so Janice 1829 and he spake unto him yet again and said this is Abraham interceding for the people in some woman's Sodom and Gomorrah first event there shall be 40 pound there will I not do it for 40 safe in Exodus 24 18 and molded went into the midst of the cloud and get into the amount and mostly was in the amount forty days and forty nights the Exodus 3428 Moses he was there with a lower forty days and forty nights he did not mean to eat predict our drink order he wrote upon that table of the words of that covenant on the Ten Commandments didn't that what Jesus did numbers 14 33 and your children shall wander the wilderness 40 years and no value for those until your carcasses we placed it in the wilderness the soldier and prison program said Noah's ministry all ministries done the same no more priests that exactly right he went into the org and when he went into the park there were seven days they nothing happened it's just a money priest to the doom Sodom and Gomorrah Jesus report to offer them as coming before the coming and the Sandman so it shall be like the days of Noah so shall be be in the days of Sodom he refer to Noah Noah had three pools and since third pool was to to the lost after the door was shut God let it sit right there when nobody could enter or go home they were inside Forest on the seventh mountain the highest mountain that's where he settled apart and you all say that name never ever ever ever they are a are our own rent they like it looks whenever I write I need help with that said again right 100 times point down Sunday yeah while you drive down a road go Ararat Iran don't anybody hear me I don't know pretty good so my brother thank you saying you are Ram s what does that trench around the mountains brother brother said let's see some of the unusual things of this I just said what was the attraction just before judgment struck the world and destroy about watering an old man at around 120 years old filming both when there was no water to float in it up there for years standing and or building away on the interior on the hand side and pitching it inside and out and saying there were the world's going to be swallowed up with water in the great scientific age what is that coming out on the hill up there father there's an old man by the name of Noah he's up there in old phonetic the old man stood in the Sun too long yeah that's me that's what I can't pronounce a he's he's sunstroke he's out of his mind he's building what he calls an arm and saying water's coming from up there word there's no water and it's going to pull all the people around and everybody that don't hear his message and everybody they won't comment is going to be drowned did you ever hear of such a thing it was an unusual attraction I imagine when the people wanted a good laugh they went up and stood before the door and that well you said it was going to rain a hundred years ago grandpa tell me they heard you up there saying it was going to rain and you're still beating around on the whole piece of wood up here why don't you get next to yourself but he was gone generated to confirm a promise and to fulfill the prophecy that his prophet had made very unusual God fulfilling his promise to know what others was laughing God was also getting ready to make history to show others even to this day that he keeps his word no matter how unreal it seems and unreasonable he still keep his word he was making an example of the old man pounding on the order for these people here in America tonight all over the world no matter what science says what they say this or that or the other he still keeps his word he was making history let's go to Genesis 19 27 to 29 and everyone get up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord and God look toward Sodom and Gomorrah and to work all the land on a plane and the hill and without the smoke of the country went up at the smoke of that furnace and it came to pass from God destroy the cities of the plain and God remember Abraham and sandlot are the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which love dwell I got that's an awesome honor Genesis in 1916 and well they lingered the man laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife upon the hand of his two daughter the Lord be merciful unto Him they brought him forth and set him without the city and he came to class when they had brought them for abroad that he said escape for the life look not behind it neither stay be in all the pain escaped to the mountains this not be consumed and not said unto them oh no so my lord and behold now that servant that found grace in thy sight and not as magnified that mercy we start a show unto me in saving my life and I cannot escape to the mountain least some he will take me and die behold now the city is near to flee unto it and it's a little oh and make me a scary theater it's not a little one and my soul shall live and he said unto him see I have sceptic be concerned this thing also that I that I will not overthrow the city for a priest dollar spoken as the escaped theater or I cannot do anything till he become theater therefore the name of the city was called storm and this time what is risen upon the earth will not enter into soul and the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven and he overthrew those cities and all the pain and all the helmet the inhabitants of the city and then which grew upon the ground but his wife looked back from behind and she became a pillar of salt [Applause] Genesis 22:1 214 and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto Him Abraham he said behold Here I am and he said take now thy son my only son Isaac whom I love us and get T into the land Ohio see I can say that 1mm and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which shall tell thee in Abraham rose up early in the morning and settled his ass and to two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and cleave the wood for the burnt offering rose up and went into the place that which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and Abraham said unto his young man I buy you here with a s and I am the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the car and his landing knife and they went both of them together and nicely expect unto Abraham his father said my father and said Here I am my son and he said Behold the fire and the wood but there's the lamb for a burnt offering and Baberaham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together they came to the place which God told him up and then Abraham built an altar and laid the wood and the altar and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and two knife to slay his son and the angel adore call onto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham you said Here I am and he said they not my hand upon my lad neither do anything unto him from now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou has not withheld thy son my only son from me and every time lifted up his eyes and looked behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns and Abraham went and look the RAM took the RAM and upper hand up for a burnt offering instead of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh it is said to this day in the mouth of the Lord it shall be seen and mountains are not as high as the mountains but it's still like a let's go to Exodus 3 1 through 12 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law priest the median age he let that the backside of the desert cake to the mountain then the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a flame of fire other miss Bella worsening he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and Moses said I will not turn outside and see this great star in the village is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto Him other mister bush and said Moses and Moses and he stayed here on him he said roll not not not hither put up thy shoes from thy feet for the place where thou standard is holy ground more always said I am the God of thy father the God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob and Moses did his face where he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I should have seen the affliction on my people which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by the reason of the test message for and on their sorrows and I come down to deliver them other than plain an Egyptian and to bring them up out of the land of the good land and the Lord onto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites the Hittites and amaura and pursue tights and the HIPAA tights and all the other sites nothing good now therefore behold the cry that children israel is come unto me and i also seen the oppression where the egyptians of president come on therefore now assembly or to fair that on his bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto God Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh and they thought she bringing for the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token of to be that I am sandy when not has brought for the people are the Egypt you shall serve upon this mountain for you are not coming to the mount that might be touched and they burned with fire and - no I'm sorry this is Hebrew for me Hebrews 12 18 24 well you're not coming to the mount that might be touched and that probably the fire they do blackness and doctor detective and this time the trumpet and the voice are the words which I heard in the treat that the work should not be spoken to them anymore well they could not endure that which was commanded in his soul as much as the beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or trusted through with adorable and so terrible was the sight that mother said is nearly fear and quake but you are come unto Mount Zion and on Thursday the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels the show the father brother says is it's like a three-foot rule you've got 12 inches here that 24 inches here you got 36 inches here but it's the same rule God the Father was revealing himself falling himself trying to get to men God the Father was manifested in a pillar father that hung on the mountain even Moses dread the quake is that right if any even a beast come near the mountain had to be trusted through with the door is that way the same God was manifested in flesh and dwelt among us and ever in a virgin born body in the order take away our sin do you believe that that God was a son he believed that is the same God my father and I are one I thought that dwell in me it's not me that doeth the works it's my father the hello Jesus talking about his father the same God revealed down here in a body of flesh one in a pillar of fire a personal experience of God and now Moses had been a bitter failure but out there now see we see his attention I took their burning bush and he looks to the burning bush to find out what the trouble was a little walk wolves walking closer to it far usually brings an attraction usually the Holy Spirit when it comes to in a manner of are attracts the attention of people and when Moses turn outside to see a sight to consider the burning tree they would not burn up God spoke to him if fresh fishing by an angel law or grace when God the Father in the form of a big cloud hung over the children of Israel and when he said on a mountain morning to write the law wait even if an animal touched among he must be trusted through with the door only through sanctification is he bringing moves it up said Aaron way down at the bottom hill to watch and to keyboard and nothing and when they feel afar said on a mom it lightning bursted forth and the tons of the rover that blackness settle for Jehovah God the creator of all Eternia settle up on top of the mountain that he created himself the thickness of the cause of the bursting forth through the lightning is shaken of the earth - then Israelites tenon on yonder the camel with a bleeding sacrifice a renown said let Moses speak and not God the Swede I think of that the great servant Moses when it's time to come and everything that had failed God said come up and climb up to the top of Mount Nebo to look over into the promised land there that came running through the air he knew that dead was all around him and most of looked around and he looked laying there and by his side and there laid the rock he stepped on the rock he follow it all the way through the wilderness or it follow him he stepped off on the rock and God said some pallbearers an angel down and I'm awake The Rock hallelujah The Rock had fed him when he was hungry giving him water when he was thirsty and taken him to whom and glory let's go to John 4 6 John 4:16
