many sicknesses among us and we just have to depend upon you cause you said you would send your word and heal us and deliver us from destruction so we love you and we thank you and guide us now in Jesus name [Music] visions one paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus grace be to you and peace from our Father and from the Lord from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ this would be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he have chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the blood in whom we have redemption through the his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will now what is the mystery of God's will to adopt his church all right the Prophet said that great glorious stand okay having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself well that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will now watch being predestinated according to this purpose okay so that's what we want to dwell a little bit on tonight who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom you also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance unto the redemption of the purchased possession you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I'm gonna go ahead and say it but I'm not going to come up to it very far because I'm gonna try to get into a place now he says whereby you're sealed unto that holy spirit of promise that when it states it like that its meaning using that word fat the hae is singular off and and dwelling in the way that he wants it to be said but now here's the point that we if we have time we'll get there if you don't we'll take it up later had you ever thought about anointed ones what do you think about anointed ones we said well we know the Prophet taught us and we believe it that you're noted on your spirit and your no need one well have you ever thought about that everybody this in any way is anointed then you better cherish the way it is because the anointing on you is no different than the anointing on anointed ones it's not you have something certain anointing and then anointed one have a certain anointing mm-hmm now you need to consider that and can and pound it in your mind for you know till the next time we're back preaching we'll try to get in two anointed ones and explain it you know because here is the point what's the difference between anointed ones and true born-again Christians and leaving a couple of things for you to think on a little to consider the point I'll give you the answer to where you won't be life left dangling anointed ones are not sealed by the Holy Spirit I'll let you think on that a little bit anointed ones are not sealed by the Holy Spirit it's just on their spirit and we get back to that we'll get into the message right because what we want to keep in our thought is what is we read here in the scripture that you're predestinated unto adoption all right then being predestinated to adoption is a great thing as I tried to explain to you went back over the services couple of times thinking about the way to express it but see I was I'm trying to explain a point predestination is by foreknowledge all right those who did he foreknew he did predestinate well that does that system old denominational ideas about predestination we've got the truth now well okay explain to me why anointed ones are not annoying or not sealed by the Holy Spirit you explain that to me we don't have to worry about it these those thoughts jangling in your mind but see predestinated everybody is predestinated by for knowledge everything is predestinated by for knowledge the car you drove up here today in is predestinated you know everything is predestinated by for knowledge cause God foreknew now are you gonna say he didn't know now you're limiting God to say that God didn't know you know what you're doing like I told you about my dad and my mother's trying to explain predestination and she said God knows everything he said God no I won't pick up ball of cotton cut it up picking cotton on the field she said yes he does he just went around it went on picking cotton he thought he'd really had her boobs you know but he did have a point to her that she couldn't explain it but see his point was if God predestinated me to do that then I got to do that huh but the predestination is a great depth of understanding once you get it into the right order it'll come out to a wonderful point but remember it's all got to be related to predestination by foreknowledge right that God foreknew what we would do all right now the Prophet says 154 Church age book we've quoted it over and over to you that it's not the person the Prophet said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it's the word our seed see because all of these persons 7 billion in the world today are predestinated by foreknowledge all right but it takes a lot to be able to say that your predestinated eternally me what I'll have you turn alive well that's good that's enough that's where you're starting from but the thing of it is everybody down through time we're not everybody but all true born-again believers have eternal life in their soul all right see so that puts them into a wonderful position okay and see each age no think about it if it's the seed our word that comes free destinated eternally from God then that cedar word is what we have to deal with to try to stay on to find out what's going on all right and see in the message now they got all this with this seed we come down this way seed we've done this see it sees their seed dad it's just all kind of seeds and you know you know that's well and good maybe they understand what it's talking about but I still got to go back to the one point that no matter what you are what you think about what you are your predestinated by foreknowledge God foreknew everything that would ever take place see that away then he could by knowing everything see here's where people with predestination cutoff see by giving God the point of understanding that it's the word then you can see that he could sit back before the world and watch every person in the world and not handpick him this one or that one because of this or that or the other but he could see that each one that wanted eternal life he would have it ready fall now that doesn't leave us into a whole seal well if we destination is he no no that leaves Robert sad see before the world he would look down through time and he would see you and he would know your desires and your thoughts then he could work according to that and he could predetermine what you're going to be I still problem with that if he sees the end why could he not predetermine it what I said we'll back up into some of those things in predestination maybe in the next message or so but I want you to think about that there's a word allotted for each age I've got a lot of these laying here if you want me to read them then do it but the Prophet said there's a word for every age there's a seed there's a word for every age all right now that seed then our word can come predestinated eternally and the people still dis come predestinated before knowledge and it's still right because if you'll think about it a little bit see we're we're the end time people we're I don't care how much longer we're left here we're still the end time people on the end of all things has come upon us and it's maybes creeping up slow but it's getting on us it's it's there all right and you say well brother Dale if I could just understand if I was predestinate it well why not go back and think about it a little and consider where you come from and how you got to where you're at and why you got to the position you're at and all you know God could be looking at that I mean he is I don't mean he could be he's looking at our lives and our doings and he can predestinate according to what those desires in each one of us but not predestinated according to his desires that's the difference in the story he desired that everybody could be saved I'm quoting brother Branham right he desired everybody could be saved all right but then by his foreknowledge he could look down through and see who would be and who would not be saved and then the word predestination simply means if you hit it in the correct overthinking it just means a destiny set to take place or a time or whatever you want to call it you know it's that set to take place all right see when Martin Luther begin to preach the just shall live by faith it was the seeder word that he was bringing right that seeder word was predestinated eternally in other words God before the world looked down through time and he just didn't pick out this and pick out that but he looked through time and he knew what would take place and when Martin Luther to doctor and preach the just shall live by faith that was what was predestinated from God not to man part the man had to be there they had to be a body there has to be a body for to carry they had to be a body for brother branham to walk on this earth or anybody there has to be a body there that would buy for knowledge God would know that see he doesn't look down and try to figure out you trying to be good either the if it is true that the seed is what comes free destinated eternally we need to be concerned about the seed the word and I by following as to what we hear right eega had it's part of the gospel he's aged had it's part of the Gospel Brunch said already predicted in case you see them that martin luther's our he would be out there trying to preach and to do and he would do windup preaching his message that no doubt he had preached on the scriptures our work says that the just shall live by faith no doubt he had preached services on that no doubt he preached may be commentaries on it cuz that was his doing forgive me but the thing of it was something one day happened to a man named Martin Luther something happened what the connection between the God and the seed come into being now any follow I'm saying then listen is not necessarily the the God and the man came into being that's normal that's part of it but they something happened in that word and Martin Luther as I said it may be preached that and preached and preached it but one day he looked down and he said that's just shall live by faith and they said he wrote alone on one side of it see he saw something then right God caught up with the man because the man was studying the word and so God caught up with that man then you got you a man and God together now that's alright we're getting to a poor coded it has to come out to predetermine it God knew that Martin Luther as I said go today about to sister was telling me a little more on component about where brother Brennan said Abraham leave garden said Abraham God knew Abraham would teach his family he'd do that see now that's for knowledge but what made the difference between Abraham and in lot or anybody else abraham believed god yeah well brother that's too simple no that's where our trouble we try to make it something else that's how simple it really is the Word of God was predetermined to come it would have to come it can't be it can't be without it because he predetermined it alright see then here comes a man walking along and he begins to think on that scripture and it just begins to unfold yeah you ever had that to happen that is you're just thinking on the Word of God and it starts unfolding and the first thing you know you're right into a channel that you've never experienced maybe before it's the word that I'm talking about the word caught up with a man or you say the man caught up with or that's why you won't go with I'm I'm not arguing the points I'm just talking to what I see that that word was to come forth all right see then if it was to come forth then God would have to be there to make it alive and he did in a man called Martin Luther so you can take anybody see anywhere Paul Peter anybody that you wanted to are coming down through or any church age each messenger you can talk about each one of them being a human being immortal that was maybe living better than most of them but still not necessarily so much but something happens and when that happens that seed comes alive that word that you heard comes alive to you you see what I never thought of that I've taught on these things but never thought of it like that do you realize it was so much personal to Martin Luther he turned the world upside down I mean regardless of what you think about him you can think about him being a hater of the Jews you can think about him being a trinitarian you think about him being all kind of things but something struck one day and you realize a man brought forth a message that was not Reformation it was restoration sure you deal with it as the way they were working all as Reformation yes but rudder on says that Luther was was a reformer Wesley was a former he calls Azusa Street a Reformation the I emphasize that because you know the Susur Street would be the baptism with the Holy Ghost poured out on the people but remember at the same time as it was being Reformation called Luther wanted to try to convert to church he didn't want to get out of anyone to convert to church at the same time it was restoration because God said I will restore the years that can't confirm locals caterpillar etc a little words I'm going to Brian C we do how something to do with our predestination because it's according to whether or not we can believe the word C then each age has had its message and it's messenger right ever age packed the message he Said's remembered I won't say he says had the message and the messenger all right when the messenger and the message got together now you're seeing predestination now you're following it the way God wants it to be followed there was a man come forward with a message and it was the messenger to the age he was predestinated to that now may I said without you going the wrong way I didn't say about the flesh I'm talking about the word so then it's the word or the seed of God which is the word of God that comes predestinated eternally from God everything else goes by foreknowledge alright see then he had his message and God had his messenger right he reached down picked up Luther and he said now Luther I know you've been and surely he way was he would have been against the church and the doings you know and he would have been living a good life and doing the things like that but something struck in the man's heart that was dot just a point of trying to live good he saw salvation now were you agree with me Martin Luther sought salvation he didn't just see works and and life's and good doings and dealings and think he saw salvation because he saw the word can you say you've seen the word of this age didn't as there was a messenger that had a message and the Prophet said to messengering the message is one now was my brother branham god no so it's not that away the messenger and the message is one is when that word was made alive to the messenger right when the word became alive to the messenger then the messenger and the message is one right because you're seeing it so it's predestination you remember what we brought out from cross a mystery of God revealed run-run says predestination he said dyers the mystery we should have known that predestination is by foreknowledge so we ought to know that's not the mystery that's being spoken the Prophet goes on to say that that great glorious stand adoption that great glorious 10y so-called something's gonna take place now whether you have followed me on what I've tried to bring for the past few months I pray you have because I'm talking about that word our seed that's been a made alive - you ain't talking about cause you hear a book and you you quote the Prophet and you you you know you quote your Bible and you remember eyes every bit of it I'm asking you has it been made alive to you you know has it come off the pages to live in your life Cosi if if the message and the messenger one then that message come off the pages to the Prophet right well see there's got to come off the pages to you and I but each age each age was predestinated as part of the mystery now follow me but each age is not predestinated unto adoption now we're gonna get in something right follow what I'm saying now for knowledge everything's predestinated there's a seed for each age if we designate a word but just remember when you're reading in Ephesians that's coming down to our time because the Prophet said there's the great mystery he didn't just come to bring a message of the just shall live by faith little Adam didn't come to bring a message about women's hair and clothes and dresses and stunts he come to bring the message of the Word of God this was revealed to him oh but you know it now because I always thought it no come on you're getting into the wrong thing you're thinking that brought around some message is just a book of rules and you're making it Reformation you maybe not even understand the terminology or their thoughts of what's being said but you're making it Reformation you're making it a carnal reform I don't cut my hair I don't wear pants I don't do this I don't do that you can do every bit of that and die and go to hell there's were anointed ones come in out right you can have every bit of that lined up and still be wrong what about that see didn't we say I know I'm saved because I did there's only one way that I know I'm saved can I quote the Prophet and a paraphrase and point others are saying it what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word right so it's got a how to do the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost if not our lives in or do it it's how much that word is brought into our hearts and made alive the new birth is when the word is made alive - you see that's that's just simple to me because it's the birth but see each age was predestinated for that age it had its own mess if you read the church ages you know I'm talking about but this age this age is the age the profit I gave it to you over and over where he said where my brother where my sister was it that the time for all this until now this is the age of predestination unto adoption not to just predestinated to you new birth because your predestinated to that I mean that's that's natural Martin Luther name didn't have predestination unto adoption no but they had predestination to the word that was to be in her age they could see and they could live and walk and talk it and be it you hadn't never just sat down and thought about those ages and read a little bit your prophet says now not just me or what the here comes Martin Luther preaching the just shall live by faith why because they turned out to be bunch of legalistic right Catholic Church do's and dont's works and things and Luther preached it just shall live by faith you believe he was church age messenger all right now do you believe John Wesley was a person church eh medicine well see John Wesley picks up trying to bring the church whereas Luther was trying to bring it into by faith John Wesley sees that it's not working that way and he goes with the legalistic form but yet it was the Word of God he was restoration see then here comes many later on that looked like it fell all the way back that they rejected the gospel now they didn't John Wesley was right Luther was right the baptism of the Holy Ghost on a Susur Street was the Word of God the Word of God was made alive in a one-eyed black man and he started a revival right what was made alive the word we need to quit doing this and quit doing that that wasn't what was laid alive no what was made alive was the word to tell you why you're doing that what can't you see salvation that way look at you see salvation - the basis that God is revealing his word I'm not trying to tell you how dirty you are and you need to get straightened up he's trying to tell you how great you are right it's not do's and don'ts its the revealed word and that word being revealed I'm just reading this I'm coming down from brother Brown see every age in times all of that it's not predestinated unto adoption this is the age that's predestinated to adoption no other aids could reach it no other time could be outside of this age well you know what there's somebody got to make that word live oh yeah the way you preach it you know you sound like it you're you're saying we're not try to be good I don't I don't want you to be good I don't want my kids to be good I want them to get saved I want my grandkids and great-grandkids I want them to get saved that'll take care of that they're doing right and wrong yeah we appreciate as a legalistic works I quit this I quit this I don't know what about some of us they didn't do them things to start with what are you gonna do with us I didn't write I didn't do those thought did that make me already saved no that made me in the worst shape because the closer to the truth is the worst part all right what are you trying to say now bro today I'm trying to talk about this AIDS and what is to be done in this age and it's so marvelous this was the age that was giving the given the entire Bible right you did not come through the prophets message you do not bring the entire mysteries of the Bible this age not none of the other ages the appalling them didn't know that in about two seals they didn't even talk about him they didn't preach about it because they didn't understand even though Jesus had preached it in Matthew 24 they still couldn't follow that Paul didn't come along with a sermon on Matthew 24 or some of the others no one explained the seals and thanks to you know but it was left to this age here comes a prophet God begins to open the word to it it just keeps unfolding until it unfolded into his adoption as I told you I told you what I think I just think it so I don't matter to me I'll tell you anyway the Lord Jesus was adopted when he got the Mount of Transfiguration that's what your prophet says better brand him when he got to sunset mountain I believe he was adopted you say well I think he was four then with us it's just me and you both talking so that's all right we just you put yours in the word and let's see what you see here identically fit the scriptures of the lord jesus' ministry into his life the word came forth the word that the world had waited on waited on melikhaya for right way to don't luke 1730 revelation 10 7 the world was waiting on it and here comes a man to bring that word seed a message that he brought ok unto adoption this age this is the greatest of all ages did your prophet make this statement he said if if it was anywhere in any time would be a age he would draw the beard to be this age you know evidently he I don't think it was just because of a better world to live in maybe it seemingly I think it was what was taking place the word begin to be revealed to the Prophet and he brought it to the bride knowing then as he come along he said now your adoption is not your birth he said your adoption is your placing now listen for a second man a placing so that means if it's a placing it means something personal placing people being placed in position people being placed adoption taking place children growing up to be sons and daughters of the Living God but I just don't see it we'll see that don't mean it ain't here you'd have been here when the Lord Jesus was here and said dad that's the same thing it out and then does now I don't in that don't that be littles instead of trying to make you look like you know something sorry is that the best way to say it but listen an eternal people predestinated to eternal life you need for me to repay a predestinated people predestinated to eternal life somebody is going to be changed right why cause the Bible says it right to solve the problem we got that out of the way the Bible said you'll be changing won't dream of somebody somebody's gonna do that so they can't be that you said what I don't believe that I don't know that I think got nothing to do with it because somebody's gonna be there cause God said it alright and see a predestinated people would with eternal life would be the seed of that age what is this age the entire Bible being revealed right sixty-six books being revealed revealing about what what is the book talking about it's talking about a predestinated people but not just to predestinated people by foreknowledge but a predestinated people of eternal life you realize if you have the new birth today you have eternal life in your soul and you know that then you were predestinated for that to come forth that's wonderful but what about still that would put you like Martin Luther that puts you in the position of following the word for your age but what about a people that one day will walk off the earth now you can see then why the Bible says day without us could not be made perfect they go somebody's gonna come to the word that the Prophet brought but it don't have to be then I'm gonna tie this together with the two parts of what I'm talking about it don't have to be people with see what we want to see signs and wonders that's well and good you know that's that's good we all enjoy that we love the presence of God we want to see people live good lives and serve God that's all well and good we'll see if it's not something personal to you what do you got I'm talking about something to work that you'll realize where you're at you realize what God has done for you paint back in your life where you come from just think back in your life where you come from and realize there's been him all the time this brought us to this place none of us wanted what we got come on oh yeah we all wanted the presence of the Lord we all wanted things to feel good we want everything like it would do it would but we didn't realize what was taking place what about that prophet standing out our on the Ohio River when a voice from heaven says your message will forerun the second coming raaah your message will forerun the second coming you think that wasn't something personal to him but like I've always said till he gets over 200 spoken words original seed and he says as I've yet Malachi 4 is not fulfil well brother ask him one time you know do you believe that's you and he said yeah I think he believed that was him don't you but then something happened in that message and God said pick up your pen and write I got something I got to explain to you and he says as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfill well don't you think did he set out to try to fulfill Malachi 4 wouldn't you but I mean you're starting home tonight and something speaks to you and says don't go that way turn out here and go down this other road go different way cause there's problems well if you've got any sense at all you'd listen to that there without how I fool around yes you know that's about two places we do what are you listening because you see the new birth is the ceiling in of the individual into the body of Christ all right that's not your adoption in the point of the adoptions and the the the coming down the three stages that's the new birth your babe in Christ but you're sealed in the kingdom right now sealed in the kingdom of God something personal happening but you got anointed ones they take out all kind of signs and wonders right I don't it going to have all kind of signs and wonders right but they're not sealed in the kingdom as a matter of fact they're sealed out there outside the kingdom they're sealed out they can't get in you can't get in being an anointed one you got to have more than just an anointing on your spirit all right then see if anointed ones are sealed out because you're the ones with the Holy Ghost is sealed in the soul of the individual looking at down on Inori wants the end time the seal of the individual is the baptism of the Holy Ghost to seal us in the kingdom of God by the new birth the anointed ones never get to happen yet look at them as far as outward emotions and signs anointed ones outshine the bride across right you but what good is it what do you mean brother than what good is it we serve God we worship God we have a good time we do yeah then you're sealed out you got somebody over here that's just struggling to live walking day by day and things of life trying to serve God and you see them struggling and yet they're sealed in the kingdom which one do you want don't know where you've ever thought about it it just clicked on the other day anointed ones you know that's the seal of God now now the true bride is not anointed on their spirit their anointed in the soul by the new birth anointed ones are anointed on their spirit realm memory reason conscious affections invite which one do we want to be because that's what we're doing we're proving one way or the other we're proving what we are right every day we're proving what we are what we're doing that's why I give me the word well I want to knowing I want I'll do I live I enjoy it I love it it's great but give me the word because the word is what seals me in okay but now anointed ones are sealed out because they can't follow the word they'll go so far is that what's your profits it did Balaam go so far Balaam had all the anointing that all the signs and wonders are all kind of things happening but when he faced a real prophet he proved then what he was is the church I'm trying to get you to look at something personal of being predestinated unto adoption this is the age this is the time this is the place there's never been an age like this there's never been a time like this that's not talking about natural bad things I'm talking about the Bride of Christ having now the Word of God but do we cherish it as the word simply thought to you just putting two things together anointed ones how great signs and wonders they won't talk to you about the word nobody ones the end I'm brother Brent I'm talking about that lady cutting the garage like he said that's why you can't tell her it's wrong for her doctor cutting graves for their schwartz on the time he succumbs she's anointed then women come up to him win brief he said i'm not gonna tell you that you're not called to preach he said i will tell you it's not in the word but he said i'm not gonna eat it that's between you and God which one do we want to be an adopted manifested son or daughter of God or just being an anointed one to have great signs and wonders and all kind of things taking place healings and signs and wonders and all like that which do you want go remember it gives you the desire of your heart right you'll give you the desire of your heart so don't desire a lot of things if you don't really want it well I want the signs and wonders of God dwelling among us amen we do but now am I gonna put that ahead of the word give me the word first and then those things will take place don't put that first don't put anointed ones first you're in bad shape because you see Urena understanding what i just say it anointed ones are not sealed in the body of Christ they're sealed out of the body of Christ true born-again Christians are sealed in the body of Christ you know what I'm sort of loves to see this I'd lovely I'd love to have those days back yell when I that's good I would do oh but now and we're gonna say this is gonna hurt all of our feelings you know why that those things are not among us today because of you and me okay we got it solved you and me because we're the only ones didn't keep it from happening right we're the ones that can keep from God doing things so he's waiting on us to get out of the way what is it what about it being so much that you could be anointed one your spirit with the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit and still be lost that's hard for the human mind to comprehend the Prophet says it's true I want to find the day that I'm living if you understand what I'm driving at my whole point of what I'm talking about tonight is one thing finding out who I am and where I'm at and what's to be expected of this age the word to be open to us is the most marvelous thing that could ever be thought of is to understand the Bible and it be revealed are you just thinking about what I'm saying then to think about you could be so anointed with all of that and have all of those great things and still be sealed out of the kingdom that's my whole point behind another day that we're living cause now listen to what I'm saying there has never been an age like this there has never been a time when anointed ones we're here like they are now right well that was anointed isn't it no not like it is now because see it's so close it would deceive the very elect if it was possible may I continue the quote the Prophet said on that one day he said frankly you'd get to pride so confuse me that's cut to work short now I paraphrase that it's pretty close to the truth what about it do you want to be an anointed one and have great signs and wonders some great opportunities and all like that great healings a great thing or you want to be the bride it'll take the word and stand on the word but you see I've never looked like a lot of people looked at adoption I've always tried to do one thing and I've talked to us from the beginning 40 years or more ago I've never looked at anointed ones to be like what a people think most of all I've ever heard talk about our adoption and things like that is it it's bringing them into view No you don't put a tutor with a man a child to raise him up to have those kind of thoughts you put a tutor with a child to raise them up to how the thoughts or the father or the intents of the father or what the father won't adoption is to bring the father on the scene not to bring the children on this thing that's what follows it but adoption is to bring the father into view in his children that's the day that we're living adoption age when the bride realized who she is the Prophet says she'll be an invincible army well I think we ought to begin to consider the things in maybe a little different way as I said because we think about adoption let me repeat that again where you won't miss it we think adoption is to bring this is the father to bring the son on the scene no adoption is for the son to get out of the way and let the father come on the scene let's get out of the way and quit hindering God with our little piti piti piti ideas and thoughts and get it settled in one time God wants a group of people to stand for his word he'll take care of the rest of it you think I'm worried about the end of the world you think I'm concerned about life and government and who's running for who and what's running for what owls told you back under hey if you think Hillary getting in the White House would get this thing to going let's put Hillary in two or three women in there altogether and just give them the whole thing I'm serious just let them have it they need it's gonna be a surprise to all of us when this is finished I believe to see how foolish we thought you know how good we thought we were or had it all figured out until God comes on the scene and makes it so simple this is the age of adoption it was never before this age the adoption the Bible talking about I preached it to you now if you're listening some of your minds is running and running and saying yeah but you preach the other day right when you're born into the family of God you are adopted into the family of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that is not your headstone that is not the statue of a perfect man those has to be developed through the child trainings etc and coming out to the ending of it it's according to how you're using it and this is the age of adoption not meaning that God wouldn't in other ages and doing things all way down through there he always was but now he's doing it greater than ever because he's putting into the hands of his children the right understanding about the word what do you think well I'd like to have this I'd like to have that I wish we can get back to the great days all right but where will that put us out of here in a rapture come on musician let's just leave it with you I hope it strikes home the thought that our knowing it once look how they do with what they can do and things could have but they're not sealed in the body of Christ but the least member of the body of Christ that's sealed in by the baptism of the Holy Ghost is greater than all of those that are anointed because this is the age of adoption this is not the age of the new birth this is not the age of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is the age of the fully revealed Word of God to go from Genesis to Revelation this is the age of it this is the time this is when we should be rejoicing I'm rejoicing in my soul of thinking about the things but dying in my flesh into knowing what's happening to the world and the people and all the things that are happening but in my soul this is set to one thing I've never been and you know yourself you've been women some of you 40 50 years I never tried to teach anything about the end of all things coming here I talked to you back there in 74 that with the pice of year 2026 so you know I'm not trying to do that what I'm saying now you better be serious things are getting worse oh yeah what do you think you know who said I don't care who's president the Bible says I put in Kings and I take out Kings so whoever who that he wants to be the next president is going to be the next president if nobody in the world votes or if everybody votes for one person except for one person out of the whole seven billion then they'll look down and say well then six billions wrong we're gonna take this one vote you understand what a meaning simple language when they want to move in they move they do what they want to do it's not for me and you if they want to close us out today they can close this out name the thing in the world we can do about it well gods don't take God take care of us ride what a day but to think that we're here if you don't get nothing out of the message they get one time Roselle believes we're in the age of adoption and adoption means that God is here God is on the scene taking us out of here I believe that let's take what we got 596 I feel the pool [Music] what about it [Music] are you seeing the inner shield out maybe learning Santos an anointed one by my right side and wondering there sailed house so the humanistic best in the world you can do this grounding of a human being can be 17 in the I know [Music] while at it screams to you'd rather be a child up in the 91 with please calm and control thing about it [Music] [Music] please try [Music] just remember blade myself will be traveling on Gemara and go try to hunt a little bit quite time maybe and all but just pray large the Lord will take care of us and I will certainly be praying for you be looking forward to all the brother Chris will be here for the weekend and just right the Lord would take care of him and give him one and our brother coming next Tuesday was Marcus and bringing the word of the Lord you know prayed the Lord would be with him and guide him and will be backing him up with our word I mean a prior cause that's what we do right mother we thank you for tonight we pray that what we said would sink down in their hearts Lord do we want to be your children or do we want to just be anointed once help us to find the day the hour that we're living because in that we'll see what adoption really is just go with us on the way home take care of everybody give a safe journey let's be loving understanding be with us in Jesus name [Music] save like
