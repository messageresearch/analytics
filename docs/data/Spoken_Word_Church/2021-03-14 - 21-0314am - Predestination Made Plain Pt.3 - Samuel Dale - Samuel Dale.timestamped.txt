[3:30] it's coming up
[3:31] about the day and time that we're living
[3:34] but we pray that you would just

[3:44] amen matthew 22
[3:49] this is the uh marriage supper you know
[3:51] that
[3:52] invites and thing but we're just mainly
[3:55] wanting the last part of the service
[3:56] part part of the scripture but
[3:58] we'll start on verse 10. so those
[4:01] servants went out into the highways and
[4:03] gathered together all
[4:05] as many as they found both bad and good
[4:09] and the wedding was furnished with
[4:11] guests and when the king came
[4:13] in to see the guest he saw there a man
[4:16] which had not owned a wedding garment
[4:19] and he saith unto him friend
[4:22] how came was thou in hither not having a
[4:25] wedding garment
[4:26] and he was speechless then said the king
[4:29] to the servant
[4:31] bind him hand and foot and take him away
[4:35] cast him into the outer darkness then
[4:38] there shall be weeping and gnashing of
[4:41] teeth
[4:42] for as many as our as far as many are
[4:46] called for many excuse me are called
[4:49] but few are chosen now that's the main
[4:52] part of what we're doing
[4:54] to get to that after a while in the in
[4:55] the message okay let's go to second
[4:57] peter
[4:59] 1 verse 10. wherefore to rather brethren
[5:03] give diligence to make your calling an
[5:04] election sure
[5:06] for if you do these things you shall
[5:08] never follow
[5:10] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[5:13] unto you
[5:14] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[5:18] of our lord and savior jesus christ now
[5:21] the point see i'm getting
[5:22] back over here you've got the wedding
[5:24] services you've got the wedding the
[5:26] coming in the bride the bridegroom and
[5:28] the thing
[5:29] and the things of happening of all life
[5:31] and then here you're coming down
[5:32] to seeing how that you get an entrance
[5:34] shall be ministered unto you
[5:36] abundantly unto the everlasting kingdom
[5:39] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[5:42] wherefore i will not be negligent to put
[5:44] you always in remembrance of these
[5:46] things
[5:47] though ye know them and be established
[5:50] in the present truth
[5:53] yeah i thank you meet as long as i am in
[5:56] this tabernacle
[5:57] to stir you up by putting you in
[5:59] remembrance
[6:00] okay you may be seated lord that is
[6:05] blessing to the word i kind of look back
[6:08] there and every time i look back i get
[6:10] kind of
[6:12] wondering if i'm leaning
[6:16] because there's there's a whole lot more
[6:19] over here on this
[6:20] side now we're over here on this side
[6:22] and it looks like the building is moving
[6:23] over so
[6:24] you know just stay where you at okay all
[6:26] right
[6:27] amen now i've tried to uh
[6:31] bring some things on predestination
[6:34] and all like that and we've studied it
[6:37] and talked about it
[6:38] and we the life's message we tried to
[6:41] cover some things about
[6:44] how does god predestinate
[6:47] all right we know predestination is a
[6:49] destiny determined
[6:51] before you know your your destiny is
[6:54] that it's it's determined if there's a
[6:57] destiny
[6:58] and then you know we're looking at the
[7:01] end of all things and i believe we're
[7:03] down here to where we can comprehend
[7:06] in this day that we have the destiny is
[7:10] here and what is our destiny what is our
[7:12] what is our uh point what are we
[7:15] supposed to be looking at in this
[7:17] age because there is a destiny their
[7:21] every age
[7:22] had a word or seed you know to give to
[7:26] that age
[7:27] and every age has fulfilled that and
[7:29] brought it forth in manifestation
[7:31] all right see then it comes to the basis
[7:34] of
[7:35] knowing that god and how he
[7:38] predestinates and how does he
[7:40] predestinate
[7:41] by what by foreknowledge
[7:45] not the fact that anybody he would
[7:48] desire anybody to be lost
[7:50] he wants everybody to be saved but he
[7:53] knows they won't be
[7:54] and we know that we have that
[7:56] understanding within ourselves
[7:58] to comprehend the point you know that
[8:00] that as many people as are in the world
[8:02] they're just not going to
[8:03] to to be saved but what you know
[8:06] everybody
[8:06] because it's not for everybody it's for
[8:09] a chosen
[8:10] people but how did he choose that
[8:13] now that's our point that we've been
[8:15] driving at for for
[8:17] time and you know and all is how can we
[8:21] how can god predetermine or
[8:25] set a destiny for someone
[8:29] you know without it being
[8:33] crossing up in and it looks like he
[8:36] picked one
[8:39] you know choosing one and losing the
[8:40] other all right
[8:42] now if we look at that basis then we're
[8:46] we're making everything on a a basis of
[8:49] choosing without having a situation and
[8:52] then when it comes to jacob and esau
[8:55] jacob have i loved and he saw how i
[8:57] hated
[8:58] well now we know that the words are for
[9:01] the hate word is not
[9:03] the right term to use there but it's
[9:06] it's not saying that god hates
[9:10] he saw he just don't like his ways
[9:14] i think see you you say well he hated no
[9:17] no
[9:18] he he didn't hate because god can't hate
[9:21] there's nothing within him to be able to
[9:23] hate his his whole makeup his whole
[9:25] thing is love his
[9:27] whole nature his ways is doing
[9:30] his love and and it cannot be determined
[9:33] to where it would be
[9:34] you know well god hates this person and
[9:37] loves that one no
[9:38] it's based on whether or not he saw
[9:42] buy for knowledge that's the main thing
[9:46] right for
[9:46] knowledge for knowledge is back there
[9:50] destiny is going to where you're going
[9:52] to
[9:54] predestinated unto
[9:57] the which means a position that you must
[9:59] come to
[10:00] that we'll get to that this afternoon
[10:02] more the lord willing but
[10:04] to think about it that
[10:08] how does god do that without
[10:12] choosing or picking but yet we know he
[10:16] does choose and pick
[10:17] right because he chose us
[10:21] all right we'll read it in the
[10:22] scriptures to get on around in a minute
[10:24] he
[10:25] we never chose him right
[10:28] he chose us he cannot override
[10:32] your free moral agency
[10:36] that can't work he must give you the
[10:40] right to choose but he knows your choice
[10:44] now if he's god then truly he would know
[10:47] before the foundation of the world
[10:49] so then he could go ahead and write all
[10:51] the names in the book or leave the names
[10:53] out of the book
[10:54] of life because he's god and he's
[10:58] infinite
[10:59] he's finite in all of his doings he he
[11:02] is
[11:02] uh you know to the basis of of
[11:06] you can't pull anything over on him so
[11:09] don't try that you know try to figure
[11:10] out well where this that or the other
[11:12] just accept it like it is that's what
[11:15] i've tried to get you to see just to
[11:17] simply talk about predestination
[11:20] in the terms and points of seeing that
[11:24] you know that god before the world ever
[11:27] begun
[11:28] in his mind he could see
[11:31] everything that would ever take place
[11:36] all right so then he would see that some
[11:39] people would want to be saved
[11:43] and he could see that some people would
[11:45] not accept their salvation
[11:48] all right so then it would be left on
[11:51] some reason
[11:52] or surpr some point or are the thoughts
[11:55] you know well
[11:56] well how does he do that
[11:59] because if he just picks out i'll take
[12:01] this one and reject that one
[12:03] then that's respect of persons
[12:08] and that's overriding your free moral
[12:10] agency
[12:11] so he's got to allow you to to do
[12:15] and it's got to be that uh like
[12:18] we talk about the the the book of life
[12:21] written before the foundational world
[12:23] when jesus christ stood as a lion slain
[12:25] before the world ever begun but see that
[12:28] had to come to a place to take place
[12:31] that was in god's mind
[12:35] all right well see one day it became a
[12:38] reality
[12:40] somewhere around 2000 years ago see that
[12:42] he died on calvary
[12:45] all right then we can see that he made
[12:47] the place he set the time
[12:50] the destiny that before the world
[12:56] not that he set a point but he knew what
[12:58] would take place
[13:01] that's what i've tried to get you to
[13:02] think on predestination
[13:04] think about it as god knowing all things
[13:09] all right see then jesus christ stood as
[13:12] a lamb slain before
[13:13] but yet that happened two thousand years
[13:16] ago in reality
[13:18] all right see you and i that's what i'm
[13:20] trying to get you to look at now
[13:22] we're in reality we're sitting here
[13:24] right now
[13:26] in reality
[13:29] right in reality now sitting here right
[13:32] now
[13:34] this is our destiny
[13:38] all right this is our point this is
[13:41] where we're living
[13:43] okay now we're going to have to go
[13:45] further on
[13:47] because there's a destiny set for things
[13:49] and all
[13:50] and there's something that see you you
[13:52] say well i'm a born-again christian well
[13:54] that's great we'll get to that this
[13:55] afternoon
[13:56] on your predestinated in adoption
[14:00] that that's not your birth it's not your
[14:02] adoption
[14:04] your adoption is your placing or setting
[14:07] and looking at somebody finding today
[14:11] where we're
[14:12] at our destiny and see then you'll see
[14:17] what it means when you come up to
[14:18] predestination
[14:19] and the point of where it goes to on
[14:21] adoption
[14:22] but to get to the point now that's what
[14:24] we're talking about
[14:26] predestination is a destiny determined
[14:31] all right we covered the said in about
[14:34] three minutes two messages so far
[14:36] trying to get the point of seeing
[14:40] how does god
[14:43] predestinate
[14:46] it's not how we think about it it's not
[14:48] what we think it is
[14:50] me because we'll get it all messed up
[14:55] but it's whether or not he what he knows
[14:58] all right and see if you say he doesn't
[15:01] know
[15:03] then what kind of a god are you serving
[15:07] me so give him the right study it like
[15:11] that and think about it
[15:13] that he would could foreknow before the
[15:15] world ever begun
[15:18] and see that and see that you would
[15:20] choose
[15:23] you would choose him as your savior
[15:27] that you would choose him as your god
[15:29] like the old testament form see
[15:31] and we studied that about abraham and
[15:34] him and what did god
[15:35] why did god go to abraham
[15:40] what was his reason what did he why did
[15:42] he choose as we look at it
[15:44] why did he choose abraham because you're
[15:46] not talking about the new birth
[15:48] so you get over into the new birth you
[15:50] get into a deeper meaning or thoughts
[15:52] about what you're talking about
[15:55] and you can see more that he that we
[15:57] were chosen in him
[16:00] all right not just the proponent of
[16:02] saying we were chosen of him
[16:04] and that's true that's good but we were
[16:06] chosen in him
[16:09] but go back there as i did with you and
[16:11] try to talk about abraham
[16:13] what made god ex go to abraham
[16:20] there must be something some reason some
[16:23] point
[16:24] that you look at to where that you can
[16:27] see
[16:29] god does not pick and choose
[16:33] you know i'll take one won't take the
[16:35] other but he knows
[16:39] he knows your destiny you don't know it
[16:44] but he knows your destiny he knows
[16:50] you're going to all right
[16:53] we may not know that much we have to
[16:55] live day by day
[16:57] that's why i keep emphasizing if we'll
[16:59] ever get to realize right where we're
[17:01] sitting now
[17:03] we're sitting in our predestination
[17:07] we're sitting in our destiny our destiny
[17:10] is being formed
[17:12] all right everything's coming in order
[17:16] all right then as it does then we can
[17:19] look at it
[17:20] and see where we're at right now
[17:24] see when we get to it this afternoon
[17:25] you'll see more about it
[17:27] that the scripture says you know that we
[17:30] were chosen of him
[17:32] he said i chose you you didn't choose me
[17:35] well then
[17:36] all right it looks like you ain't got
[17:38] nothing to do with anything
[17:43] all right now that's what i tell you
[17:44] that you've got to understand about the
[17:45] bible
[17:46] and the way it is and the way the word
[17:48] of god turns out to be
[17:50] because on one set of scales or one way
[17:52] of looking at it
[17:54] he chose you you didn't have anything to
[17:57] do with the choosing
[17:58] but on the other side of the same scale
[18:01] you're looking at it
[18:02] and the fact that you chose him
[18:05] you accepted him
[18:08] all right see it has to be done that way
[18:11] to bring both of them into view
[18:13] and when you do you bring it together in
[18:16] a situation of saying
[18:17] well now he chose me
[18:20] so it don't matter what i do or what it
[18:22] is because he chose me
[18:25] all right now see that won't work
[18:28] all right but the fact was true that he
[18:31] did choose you
[18:34] but then the fact is true that you must
[18:36] accept him
[18:39] he cannot override your free moral
[18:41] agency and make you is
[18:43] choose him right
[18:46] no he knew though before knowledge
[18:52] going all the way back in the mind of
[18:53] god all the way before the foundation
[18:55] world he knew before the world ever
[18:56] begun
[18:57] before anything ever started or he had
[19:00] in his mind
[19:01] what he was going to do he was going to
[19:04] have
[19:04] a group of people he was going to bring
[19:06] into being a people
[19:08] upon the earth he knew that in his
[19:10] foreknowledge
[19:12] all right but not only that he knows
[19:14] what those people will do
[19:19] see that way he's not making you
[19:22] choose him
[19:27] he's looking at the fact of what you did
[19:29] you accepted him
[19:32] if you don't bring it on the point of a
[19:35] free moral agency to put it
[19:37] to worthy he can't override that and
[19:40] make you saved
[19:41] but he can look at what will take place
[19:44] and know what your salvation is
[19:46] and have everything ready
[19:50] now when you get down to where we're at
[19:52] now from where we are sitting today and
[19:54] i'm going to say it that way where
[19:56] you'll
[19:56] uh i'll try to keep everything trying to
[19:58] make it certain
[20:00] lining up to where we are now all right
[20:02] not yesterday and not tomorrow
[20:05] but we'll get to it this afternoon and
[20:07] the prophet says you're predestinated
[20:08] unto adoption
[20:11] all right somebody has to come to that
[20:13] place
[20:17] see then somebody has to reach that pla
[20:19] and it is based upon what
[20:21] you accept right
[20:26] statute of perfect man is not based upon
[20:28] god just pouring it into you
[20:30] it's based on what you can accept all
[20:33] right we've got to get that right see
[20:35] because where we are now going on
[20:38] nobody i don't mean to get into the
[20:40] season but i'll repeat it don't bother
[20:42] see nobody in no age has been
[20:45] predestinated unto adoption
[20:47] but this age here you're predestinated
[20:51] to a destiny
[20:53] every age has a seed a word a
[20:56] predestination and a destiny
[20:58] to come to that place martin luther is
[21:00] wade was bringing out the other day and
[21:02] these brothers have been talking about
[21:04] martin luther of the just shall live by
[21:06] faith that was the predestinated word
[21:08] for that age
[21:13] all right see then once he reached that
[21:15] age
[21:16] he had reached his position and he had
[21:19] to go by the grave
[21:22] he couldn't stay here see then john
[21:25] wesley comes along with sanctification
[21:27] all right that was another word
[21:29] predestinated
[21:31] that had to take place and in doing that
[21:35] see then his destiny that god before the
[21:38] world
[21:39] saw john wesley come to that place
[21:42] and he had the word for him
[21:46] all right she come in through your zeus
[21:48] street and thing
[21:50] and that's good but remember
[21:53] that's not the finish of the story
[21:58] the finish of the story is in me and you
[22:03] and we've got to remember one thing he
[22:08] could see the beginning and the end
[22:12] in the beginning before the world ever
[22:14] begun anything any anything other than
[22:16] being in his mind
[22:18] right let's don't try to get anything
[22:20] out of that let's get it into that
[22:23] when we finish up the message maybe this
[22:25] afternoon
[22:27] we'll talk about gifts and callings
[22:35] there's gifts and callings that are
[22:38] without
[22:40] without anything you do that god does
[22:43] give them to us
[22:46] but we've got to get the rest of it
[22:47] right up to there
[22:49] we've got to understand that no matter
[22:52] what takes place what here
[22:54] there had to be a foreknowledge of
[22:56] knowing that god would send a prophet
[22:59] in this day of malachi 4.
[23:03] and that would be a predetermined seed
[23:06] to take place in the day that you and i
[23:07] are living
[23:09] well just think of it on one thing why
[23:11] can't you think of it this way
[23:12] if he predestinated a prophet for the
[23:14] age a seed a word for the age
[23:17] he would have to predestinate a people
[23:20] to accept that word
[23:24] we're going to go beyond four knowledge
[23:28] when we eventually get there you see you
[23:30] can't go do that
[23:33] why not he's the infinite god
[23:38] he knows all things so he knows
[23:40] everything this is well one way as he
[23:41] knows the other way
[23:42] all right but are you thinking with me
[23:45] what how does he predestinate
[23:49] we know he does not predestinate we've
[23:51] been through these you
[23:52] and they can bring this up if they want
[23:54] to on the the quotes i'm beginning
[23:56] lately to just give you the tape it's
[23:58] out of and
[23:59] and going to trying to get you to
[24:01] understand to help us
[24:02] to realize that go to number one which
[24:05] is the harvest time
[24:06] where pre god has predestinates by his
[24:09] foreknowledge
[24:13] all right and then he can set the
[24:16] destiny
[24:18] by that foreknowledge and not by your
[24:21] desires
[24:24] he desired that everybody be saved
[24:29] and we have to look at the thing and
[24:30] seeing that we didn't desire him
[24:35] we didn't understand now but we didn't
[24:37] desire him
[24:41] he chose us right
[24:44] all right then when he chose us see then
[24:47] i've got to
[24:48] ex to accept what he done
[24:53] knowing that he has a destiny
[24:56] set for me we're living our destiny you
[25:01] understand
[25:02] we're living every day our destiny yeah
[25:04] right
[25:05] right we're beyond pentecost jesus
[25:09] streets and things
[25:11] by the opening of god's word all right
[25:14] and in being that then our destiny is
[25:16] set
[25:18] right but we've got to come to that
[25:19] destiny
[25:22] we've got to come to that place
[25:26] don't you think that god before the
[25:27] world knew what we would do
[25:31] don't you think he knows what your
[25:32] desire is
[25:34] now how did we covered about abraham
[25:38] what caused god to look to abraham
[25:42] when there were a lot of people in the
[25:44] world in that day
[25:47] and he chose one man
[25:50] abraham
[25:54] right right now why did he choose him
[26:00] because by his foreknowledge abraham
[26:02] chose him
[26:03] or accepted him he knew abraham would
[26:08] accept what he's doing
[26:10] that was what i was trying to drive that
[26:12] last week to get you to see it
[26:14] he knew what abraham would do and that's
[26:16] what drawed him to abraham
[26:19] he knew his brother brown said he said
[26:22] he knew abraham would teach his children
[26:27] he knows whether or not you'll teach
[26:29] your children and try to bring them to
[26:31] the truth
[26:32] amen all right
[26:35] see then his predestination is not to
[26:38] look down through time and say
[26:39] i need somebody so oh i'll just take
[26:41] this guy
[26:43] now there was something about abraham
[26:48] and i tried my best to explain it to you
[26:53] abraham the bible said believed god
[26:59] and it was imputed unto him for
[27:02] righteousness
[27:03] so whatever you make abraham to be
[27:07] or have or whatever make it the point
[27:10] that
[27:11] god knew
[27:14] see then that way you won't be running
[27:16] over into our day in our times and
[27:18] getting the message and bring the quotes
[27:20] and try to prove our point
[27:21] oh that we we were back there before the
[27:24] foundational world
[27:27] well in god's mind yeah but in god's
[27:30] mind
[27:30] everybody was back there in god's mind
[27:34] he wrote the book of life right right
[27:37] but he also wrote if daniel has it
[27:39] there's books
[27:44] see that's what i'm trying to get you to
[27:46] see and get you to look at
[27:47] god for new everybody amen
[27:51] he knows what everybody will do he's not
[27:54] just speaking and choosing
[28:00] you've got to get to where you're at to
[28:01] be able to understand that this is the
[28:03] only age
[28:06] that will bring it to the picking and
[28:08] choosing
[28:11] so you and i have a choice
[28:14] we can take the word we can receive it
[28:16] we can go up the statue of a perfect man
[28:19] or we can just laze around and say
[28:21] forget it
[28:24] but you know nobody's ever had that
[28:26] except you and i
[28:28] now get that point nobody's ever had
[28:33] the opportunity that you have
[28:38] that's what i've been driving at that's
[28:39] what i've been trying to preach to you
[28:42] you have an opportunity that nobody has
[28:45] ever had
[28:46] right amen
[28:49] because you can go back to seeing how
[28:51] that you could be
[28:57] a part of god
[29:00] and how that the prophet would say god
[29:03] is not complete without you
[29:05] now i didn't make those statements your
[29:08] prophet did
[29:10] all right but you see there was
[29:13] something about abraham
[29:16] that caused god to move into that
[29:18] position
[29:22] he said well he he foreknew right
[29:26] he foreknew that that abraham would
[29:28] receive him
[29:30] that's what i'm trying to drive to to
[29:32] get you to see
[29:33] by his foreknowledge he knew abraham
[29:35] would do what he would do
[29:38] but he knew the rest of the people would
[29:40] do what they would do
[29:43] so he's not picking and choosing
[29:48] right he's going by the fact of what he
[29:51] knows
[29:53] he knows abraham would do the way he
[29:56] done
[29:57] that's right but he knows he could deal
[30:00] with
[30:01] you know with anybody else in that day
[30:03] he could deal with them for a hundred
[30:05] years and they'd never move one stitch
[30:13] you just think about abraham
[30:16] get what i'm talking about get your
[30:19] predestination get out
[30:20] all of your your great ideas of oh if i
[30:23] was back before the world then i'll be
[30:25] all
[30:25] i'll be back before well everybody was
[30:27] back before the world in god's mind
[30:29] that's right every person that would
[30:32] ever be in the world every gnat that
[30:34] would ever come into the world
[30:35] was in the mind of god before the world
[30:38] so that's why i've always tried to teach
[30:40] you i don't want to be
[30:42] what god thinks of in his mind
[30:46] i want to be a part of the one that's
[30:48] doing the thinking
[30:50] amen amen
[30:53] i want to be a part of him amen
[30:59] see then that way then i'll find out
[31:01] that i'm not picking
[31:02] i mean he wasn't picking and choosing
[31:05] but yet he was
[31:07] that's what i'm telling you i can cover
[31:10] the scale and go one way
[31:12] and preach to you about how that god
[31:14] chose you
[31:15] and you didn't choose him you didn't
[31:17] have nothing to do with it you know
[31:19] you know you can bring it all down
[31:20] because that's the way people go
[31:23] but turn right around and go over on the
[31:25] other side of the scale
[31:27] and preach the point that
[31:30] god was looking at you and you made a
[31:33] choice
[31:38] he said well i just don't understand it
[31:40] because one way you're saying i made a
[31:42] choice another way you're saying i
[31:43] didn't make a choice
[31:44] that's what i'm talking about
[31:47] that's what i want us to see
[31:53] there was a whole world full of people
[31:57] god could come down and talk to a lot of
[31:59] them
[32:02] but why did he choose abraham
[32:07] see there was something about the nature
[32:10] of the man
[32:15] what does he wind up to be i think it's
[32:17] four times said our father abraham
[32:23] why does it wind up to be that abraham
[32:26] is the father of faith
[32:32] ever what he was looking at in abraham
[32:35] wound up one day to walk on this earth
[32:38] in the human flesh
[32:41] and wound up dying to give his life
[32:49] where you could have an eternal life
[32:56] you can't just put it on one way and
[32:58] look at it and say
[32:59] well i i just don't understand i just i
[33:02] just accept the fact that he
[33:03] he he died for me well that's good
[33:09] but we're in a day when it's meaning
[33:11] more to us than ever
[33:13] that there's something about this end
[33:15] time
[33:16] that god has been waiting on the people
[33:23] he's waiting on you and i
[33:30] he's waiting for you and i to come to
[33:32] our choice
[33:37] to worthy he can look at it and say that
[33:40] was what i saw before the world ever
[33:42] begun
[33:45] was you making that choice
[33:48] and i've been just waiting in other
[33:50] words that's the way god would say it
[33:52] was human terminology i was just waiting
[33:54] for you to come to the place to where
[33:56] you could accept it
[33:59] see there's something about you that's
[34:02] different
[34:03] well a new birth that's all right
[34:06] but remember abraham was a man without
[34:10] the new birth
[34:14] he never had the new birth to make a
[34:16] choice from
[34:18] you have something that motivates your
[34:20] choice today
[34:26] you come a long ways to be able to get
[34:28] here today
[34:29] something motivated that choice
[34:34] huh see you didn't have to you could
[34:37] stay home flat tape
[34:40] you know you could just stay at home
[34:42] flat tight get the tape just play it
[34:49] but listen church he's not looking for
[34:51] the people that just want to
[34:52] well i would listen to the tapes i do
[34:54] this out now i'm just
[34:55] i'm in the message i'm listening to the
[34:57] prophet i get it straight from the
[34:59] prophet
[35:01] i don't listen to nobody else
[35:04] well you think god didn't see that
[35:10] would you think god didn't see you
[35:11] struggling to get here today
[35:15] i remember brother zemer was talking
[35:17] about this brother told him about it and
[35:19] you know and he was going to
[35:22] jeffersonville and
[35:23] and brought around and told him said you
[35:24] struggled all the way here he they asked
[35:26] him sit or talk to him said
[35:27] well what about it what huh he said i
[35:29] just got in the car and drove there
[35:32] but to brother branham it was a great
[35:33] struggle there's no telling what went in
[35:35] between
[35:35] all of that he may have had a flat tire
[35:37] he may have had a disney he may have had
[35:39] that he may have had a wreck he may have
[35:41] had all kinds of things
[35:46] and god looks at it like that
[35:49] he's looking at your desire
[35:52] he predestinates according to your
[35:54] desire
[35:55] not according to his own desire because
[35:57] he desired that everybody be saved
[36:01] but he looks at your desire he looked at
[36:04] abraham and he saw a man
[36:06] that he contacted him
[36:11] and then he knew that he'd contact him
[36:13] many many times
[36:15] in his journey and it would keep
[36:17] unfolding
[36:20] but he knew what abraham would do so
[36:22] abraham's called the father of faith
[36:25] i've always tried to get you to see that
[36:27] there's a man without the new birth
[36:34] without the new birth that man still
[36:37] there was something about him
[36:39] that god looked down and saw him
[36:43] it's like i said we'll get the gifts and
[36:44] callings without repentance
[36:49] what about moses what about all the
[36:52] gifts that was in the man
[36:54] what about brother branham what about
[36:56] all the gifts
[37:00] it's not the person that comes
[37:01] predestinated eternally from god
[37:03] it's the word of seed
[37:07] you've got to accept the word for your
[37:09] age and your time
[37:12] but you've got to find it the prophet
[37:13] preached the message there recognized in
[37:15] your day in its message
[37:18] we believe brother branham was a prophet
[37:20] we've been well praise god
[37:24] but there's a lot more goes with it
[37:31] see a predestinated group of people
[37:39] that their destiny before the world ever
[37:41] begun
[37:42] was already set
[37:45] wait a minute we see it was set because
[37:49] he looked back there and saw it
[37:52] or in other words he sat there and saw
[37:54] it i asked you a question about
[37:56] predestination
[37:58] was god before the world looking at
[38:02] the whole world ahead of him and seeing
[38:04] it
[38:06] or is he looking at it now
[38:11] is this what he was looking at why can't
[38:14] you move it up to where we are
[38:20] come on do you understand what i'm
[38:21] getting at you understand what i'm
[38:22] saying
[38:24] what predestination him sitting back
[38:26] there
[38:27] looking to the forward or his
[38:29] predestination him living it with us
[38:36] your prophet could talk about the lamb
[38:38] that stood before the foundation of the
[38:39] world
[38:40] and all like that but then turn right
[38:42] back around and say
[38:44] but you know that took place 2000 years
[38:46] ago
[38:48] you realize what would have happened had
[38:50] that not taken place 2000 years ago
[38:54] it would have made the word a false
[38:55] prophecy
[38:57] you realize your prophet said there's
[38:59] going to be a bride
[39:01] to come to a change of the body and if
[39:03] somebody don't reach there
[39:05] then it would wind up being false
[39:06] prophecy
[39:09] but don't you worry about it
[39:12] it's already predetermined
[39:15] all we got to do is just walk that's
[39:18] what i'm trying to get you to see it
[39:19] ain't hard
[39:21] you say how are we going to get out of
[39:23] here brother dale how are we going to
[39:24] come to a change of the body how are we
[39:26] going to
[39:26] when we fulfill the word that is
[39:29] predestinated
[39:30] in the age that we're living that's
[39:32] right amen
[39:34] when we live the life
[39:41] see then god did choose you for some
[39:44] reason
[39:47] but he didn't choose everybody for some
[39:50] reason
[39:51] so i keep going back to it he looked at
[39:53] abraham and he saw in that man what he
[39:56] was looking for
[39:58] someone that he could come down and
[40:01] contact
[40:02] and get him to line up and go with him
[40:04] and walk
[40:10] when there was the whole world
[40:14] it could have picked any of them like
[40:17] i've always tried to get you to
[40:18] to think about their little virgin mary
[40:27] how many little virgins in that day was
[40:30] going around saying
[40:31] you know i could be that girl i could be
[40:33] that one the bible speaks
[40:35] because they could read it
[40:39] you remember brother branham while he
[40:40] was doing he said
[40:45] joseph and mary was sitting down and
[40:46] said they were talking about
[40:48] the message and the hour and all and he
[40:51] said that was what
[40:52] was on her mind if she was going to the
[40:54] well that morning
[40:56] to get some water
[41:02] and god just stepped out in the form of
[41:04] an angel
[41:08] but you see she said what the key was
[41:13] why did god choose her the key was
[41:16] what's she saying
[41:18] that's right when he told her that angel
[41:21] told her what was
[41:22] said and she said uh first off she's
[41:25] right
[41:26] uh how can i do it not knowing a man
[41:28] right that was human
[41:29] that was all he said god's gonna take
[41:31] care of that then she just turned around
[41:32] and said
[41:33] be it unto me according to what you've
[41:36] told me
[41:39] that was what contacted god
[41:45] are you following me if you're looking
[41:48] for anything to contact god with
[41:50] go back to his word
[41:57] see i've tried to tell you about it you
[41:59] know and i'm not trying to make anything
[42:01] of me in their thoughts or anything
[42:03] but that was the thing that caught me
[42:07] i told my wife i said i was reading the
[42:10] bible one day and i told her i said
[42:12] before the end of the world comes
[42:13] there's gonna be two
[42:14] prophets well see i couldn't get it
[42:17] straight i didn't know how to straighten
[42:18] it up
[42:19] so i had malachite three malachi 4.
[42:25] and i said i could see that
[42:28] well why would i see it
[42:32] when the theologians couldn't see it
[42:37] they didn't see it
[42:40] they didn't accept it when it came
[42:43] right see by the proof of what it was as
[42:47] to whether or not it was right or not
[42:49] and what i was doing i accepted it quick
[42:52] as i heard it
[42:54] and never had any trouble
[42:57] except in the message
[43:03] right why
[43:10] all right and look at it easily by it
[43:14] being that away god had something he
[43:16] could come down and contact me with
[43:18] that's right
[43:22] when brother mark begin to talk about a
[43:24] prophet coming in and down
[43:25] then like i told you about that man one
[43:28] day at work
[43:29] was talking about the jehovah witness
[43:30] and their doctrine he said
[43:33] if you just believed in prophets me and
[43:35] you could talk
[43:37] i said i got a little bit of
[43:39] understanding of the bible i said
[43:41] let's go let's let's get started talking
[43:43] i i think i can
[43:44] i think i can kind of hang with you a
[43:46] little bit about prophets
[43:48] you know because there i was trying to
[43:52] talk to him about who the prophet was
[43:54] you know all right what are you with me
[43:58] see i'm trying my best to get you to see
[44:00] this point
[44:03] some reason or some point sure
[44:07] god looked down and he saw every move
[44:09] every man would ever make everything
[44:18] he saw that he would give everybody a
[44:20] change
[44:25] and he wouldn't pick or choose
[44:30] sure he would choose in the bases that
[44:32] when we accepted him
[44:35] because you've got to accept him as your
[44:36] savior
[44:39] you say he accepted me that's the
[44:41] important thing no
[44:42] no he's working on the basis that you
[44:46] accepted him
[44:50] and then when you come to the point of
[44:52] seeing that you accepted him as your
[44:54] savior
[44:56] then he can bring salvation on the view
[44:59] into view
[45:01] to break it make it personal
[45:05] he saw before the world ever begun that
[45:07] the man would die on a cross
[45:11] right
[45:14] but you know what one day that man had
[45:15] to die on the cross or it would have
[45:17] just been no good
[45:21] think about where you come from and how
[45:23] you heard about the message in the thing
[45:28] just think about that sometimes and how
[45:30] that you con you you was contacted as we
[45:32] call it or you
[45:33] you you know you come into the message
[45:35] you you received it you walked in it
[45:38] i can say i can tell a few of your thing
[45:41] or boyd raised his hand
[45:43] well you know what he had to do he had
[45:44] to quit this job had to go through this
[45:46] job and go through that job and come to
[45:47] gainesville
[45:50] well then he had to meet janet and then
[45:51] he had this i'd had help
[45:57] what about it just think about it this
[46:00] thing ain't
[46:01] haphazard and it's simple
[46:06] once you see it
[46:09] get it all straight of how that god
[46:11] could set back before the world
[46:14] and see everything that would ever take
[46:15] place
[46:19] but the way i think see i'm sorry that's
[46:22] just the way i think
[46:23] i think he can go over here and look
[46:25] back that away
[46:29] i think god can go to the end and look
[46:31] back and see the beginning
[46:36] he's infinite
[46:41] see
[46:45] so then i'm asking you is this the
[46:48] predestination
[46:51] you're living your predestination
[46:56] you've accepted jesus christ as your
[46:58] savior right
[47:00] all right according to the prophet now
[47:02] he said that's predestination
[47:04] he said but now predestination is not
[47:06] your new birth
[47:11] adoption and things not your new birth
[47:16] stature of perfect man is what you got
[47:18] to be dealing with now
[47:20] so we're a group of people that's got
[47:21] something personal
[47:23] right out of the word of god that has
[47:24] got to be fulfilled in our
[47:26] age we have got to come to the place
[47:30] of the statute of a perfect man and why
[47:32] can't we say
[47:33] us
[47:37] why can't we believe it's us
[47:45] see think about it how that god crossed
[47:48] your path
[47:51] that's what i was trying to do with you
[47:52] the other day in the messenger how that
[47:54] god contacted abraham
[47:57] how that god contacted moses how that
[48:00] god contacted david
[48:09] see there was something about david
[48:13] that the bible says he's a man after my
[48:15] own heart
[48:18] now he was a murderer he was all kind of
[48:19] thing but you know what he had a nature
[48:21] about him that god life you know what
[48:23] his nature was
[48:24] he loved god
[48:29] that's simple he loved god
[48:37] see he didn't know
[48:41] about all the things but he just knew
[48:45] but then one day he came in contact with
[48:48] the prophet i like what uh
[48:53] uh saul said you know
[48:58] he's trying to talk to her one time it's
[48:59] in the movies this man's ways but it was
[49:01] a good point
[49:03] he said telling them boys and i said
[49:06] just be aware of an old man with a
[49:08] bottle
[49:13] you know what i'm talking about he
[49:15] contacted saul he
[49:16] anointed him he'd become king he had a
[49:19] lot of trouble all through his life
[49:20] he said just beware of an old man
[49:24] with a bottle i thought somebody picked
[49:27] that up in that movie and put it in
[49:29] there is a good point
[49:33] but listen
[49:36] do you see how that he could
[49:39] predetermine something
[49:42] by the fact of what that person would
[49:44] choose
[49:45] okay
[49:51] ephesians says 1-3
[49:55] he has chosen us in him before the
[49:58] foundation of the world
[50:05] now let's try to bring this thing
[50:08] up a level
[50:12] because looking at it from the old
[50:13] testament standpoint
[50:16] see you're not looking at it
[50:20] to where this fulfills what it wants to
[50:22] be this is a new testament scripture
[50:25] this is speaking of jesus christ
[50:31] it was fine back there christ was spoke
[50:33] of through the bible he's read
[50:35] he done and all but yet when we come to
[50:38] the new testament part
[50:40] to think about
[50:44] what happened what happened the day you
[50:48] accepted him as your savior
[50:51] you realize the bible says that no man
[50:53] can come to god unless the father calls
[50:55] him
[50:56] okay
[51:00] then that's why i read the scriptures i
[51:01] make your calling and election
[51:03] sure make your calling
[51:07] an election be scriptural or
[51:09] understanding
[51:10] [Music]
[51:13] make it be what the bible's talking
[51:15] about not some well if i was
[51:17] if i predestinated i'll be there
[51:23] god knew he knew i won't be saved
[51:29] you realize what we're doing today
[51:31] proves whether we are
[51:33] chosen of god
[51:39] what you're doing right now the thoughts
[51:41] you're having right now
[51:42] and things about what i'm talking about
[51:44] is proving whether or not you are
[51:47] called of god
[51:52] well brother dale just don't understand
[51:53] see then you're not called of god
[51:58] see i hate to say those statements but i
[52:00] want to say them to where that you'll
[52:02] think
[52:06] where you'll think about it where you'll
[52:08] sit down and ponder it sometimes in your
[52:10] mind
[52:11] and praying and asking god reveal this
[52:14] to me
[52:17] the word i can see what's going on it
[52:20] sounds like to hear that
[52:22] he has chosen me but it sounds like over
[52:24] here that i had to choose him
[52:30] see then we we finalized it by saying
[52:32] you can't do both of them
[52:33] well you can in god
[52:39] because he chose us but he knew what we
[52:42] would do
[52:45] he didn't give you eternal life before
[52:47] the world
[52:50] that's the problem with the people see i
[52:52] always was eternal
[52:55] that's in god's mind
[53:02] because it took 6 000 years to get from
[53:04] god's mind
[53:05] of jesus christ dying on the cross to
[53:08] get it into a stage of reality
[53:10] right come on are you with me
[53:14] it took 6 000 years or well 4 000 to
[53:17] bring it up to be
[53:18] technical
[53:22] to bring it to where that he could die
[53:24] on a tree
[53:29] like i've always said to you he couldn't
[53:31] die at two years of age
[53:34] two years of age he couldn't be your
[53:35] savior
[53:37] he couldn't be your healer
[53:40] he had to wait till the time he couldn't
[53:43] be your advocate
[53:44] until he become of age to where he could
[53:48] fulfill that and his ministry only
[53:49] lasted a three and a half year period
[53:52] but yet it finished by calvary
[53:59] see in calvary is where he where we were
[54:01] chosen at
[54:03] was we chosen before the world or was we
[54:06] chosen
[54:07] when he died on a tree
[54:11] in god's mind he saw us and saw what we
[54:15] do
[54:15] but in reality
[54:19] you couldn't accept salvation until
[54:21] jesus christ died
[54:23] are you with me you had to wait you had
[54:27] to be
[54:28] so then it's not just a haphazard thing
[54:30] that well we we do this or that
[54:36] see i keep referring to abraham and then
[54:38] try to bring it over now to where
[54:40] we're taking it into the new birth for
[54:42] this afternoon
[54:47] but there was something about abraham
[54:50] and god knew now listen i'm going to say
[54:52] it and i mean it this way because i'm
[54:54] going to say it that way
[54:56] abraham was the only man in the world
[55:01] that god could come down
[55:05] and contact him and that he would follow
[55:08] him
[55:09] now you tell me i'm wrong there and i'll
[55:11] tell you you sure don't understand the
[55:13] word of god
[55:16] there was a world full of people
[55:19] billions
[55:23] even if you want to cut it down with
[55:24] brother dale it wouldn't be and see you
[55:26] want to get technical with me i'll get
[55:27] technical
[55:28] if you had a million if you had ten
[55:31] thousand i still am all
[55:32] i still a large point of what i'm
[55:33] talking about did he pick
[55:36] one man
[55:40] he chose one man
[55:43] but you see what was he going by
[55:48] in his mind
[55:52] in reality he met abraham that's what
[55:55] i'm talking about trying to get you to
[55:56] see
[55:57] in reality the calvary come to pass then
[56:00] you could bring salvation into view
[56:04] abraham met god in reality
[56:08] real personal saw him
[56:12] talked with him fed him
[56:16] communion
[56:24] see god was looking there
[56:27] and he said lord before the world
[56:32] this is the man
[56:36] are you women and listen to one talking
[56:38] about god could look before the world
[56:41] by his infinite foreknowledge and thing
[56:43] he said i'm looking for somebody
[56:46] that i could contact did he wind up
[56:49] being the father of faith that he wind
[56:50] up all the things and wind up the book
[56:52] of
[56:53] of hebrews 11 lays a lot on abraham
[57:01] and he says i've i've got the man now
[57:05] all i got to do is let him know it
[57:10] i've chosen him and everything's going
[57:11] to be all right but now he's got to
[57:13] choose me
[57:15] in other words he's got to make up his
[57:16] own mind now that there's something
[57:18] about this it's a reality
[57:23] you take moses listen i was thinking
[57:25] about him the other day
[57:26] you're taking reading the scriptures on
[57:28] what i'm studying on
[57:29] there's moses he goes out on the
[57:32] backside of the desert
[57:37] right he gets run off he goes out
[57:42] he's out there for about 40 years
[57:48] and all at once something began to talk
[57:50] to him in a way that a bush got on fire
[57:53] he went to see about it
[57:56] then god began to talk to him you think
[57:59] god didn't know how to contact him
[58:05] the way brother branham brings it if
[58:06] you'll listen to him he said what moses
[58:08] was he said
[58:09] he was a uh uh he was a
[58:12] in other words he had the ability to
[58:15] study it out and he thought about
[58:17] now that bush is not supposed to be
[58:18] burning
[58:21] moses was a very smart man he could
[58:23] teach the egyptians and them egyptians
[58:25] could do a lot of things in that day
[58:30] but there when he contacted moses
[58:34] he said moses i want you to go he said
[58:39] i can't talk i can't do it he tried to
[58:40] do everything he could to get out of it
[58:42] look at that human god said okay i'll
[58:45] give you a mouth aaron will be your
[58:50] prophet he'll be your mouthpiece
[58:53] and you bring up any excuse you want to
[58:55] i'm going to answer that excuse
[58:57] and i'm going to tell you
[59:00] moses said who do i tell them
[59:04] he said i believe that you're the god of
[59:06] abraham isaac and jacob
[59:10] but he said i want something personal
[59:12] now
[59:14] i want this thing to be where they
[59:16] there's not going to be any argument
[59:17] when
[59:18] i get down there where i won't be
[59:19] obscured
[59:22] i can step out and say this is it
[59:27] he said just go tell him i am sensing
[59:31] now why did moses grab that all at once
[59:33] there's not a word in there
[59:34] i've read that and studied that and
[59:36] pondered over it thinking about
[59:38] there's not one word in there that moses
[59:40] said another word after that
[59:47] when he said i am that i am he said
[59:50] okay i'm ready to go
[59:54] brother brown said he run away taking
[59:56] his kids throwing them on on the
[59:58] the back of the donkey now he went
[1:00:05] naturally probably moses as a human
[1:00:07] being he probably thought a lot about it
[1:00:09] he thought
[1:00:09] well surely there's a contact i've made
[1:00:11] here with something supernatural
[1:00:13] so i could go down there and just whoop
[1:00:14] the whole crowd because remember
[1:00:16] moses was the the leader in
[1:00:20] in all the armies and everything of of
[1:00:22] egypt
[1:00:24] he could have caused it insurrection
[1:00:29] but he said get you a stick and let's go
[1:00:33] by this stick you'll be able to take
[1:00:35] over that nation
[1:00:37] he said well i see now it's not going to
[1:00:40] be my
[1:00:41] my power with a a group of army buddies
[1:00:44] that's going to help me get this thing
[1:00:45] started
[1:00:46] i'm kind of facing it by myself
[1:00:49] and he goes walking out
[1:00:54] what caused david to just say
[1:00:58] why are y'all so scared of that guy
[1:01:00] standing out there
[1:01:01] well he ain't nothing a little old run
[1:01:05] him standing out there and david looking
[1:01:07] over there like you know
[1:01:10] hey look at that little old run out
[1:01:12] there said man that's what that man was
[1:01:14] saying to him he ain't never a little
[1:01:15] runt come out here to fight me
[1:01:18] but to david he the giant was just a run
[1:01:21] he didn't care he said the buyer
[1:01:25] the line
[1:01:28] took care of them i just take care of
[1:01:30] this right
[1:01:33] he put five smooth stones in there
[1:01:35] because they said
[1:01:36] that he had four brothers that might
[1:01:40] come up to help him
[1:01:42] right so he said i'll just make sure and
[1:01:47] care enough to where i got enough to
[1:01:48] take care of them
[1:01:50] because i'm going to take care of the
[1:01:51] whole thing because i've done
[1:01:53] met in person now listen
[1:01:58] i want you to listen
[1:02:02] abraham met the person
[1:02:05] of god called melchizedek
[1:02:12] two or three times out of his meeting
[1:02:16] moses met god in a burning bush
[1:02:26] david met god with that crucial oil that
[1:02:28] was poured on his head
[1:02:31] because like i've always tried to get
[1:02:33] you to see
[1:02:35] once david was anointed
[1:02:38] he wouldn't obscure to nothing once he
[1:02:41] was anointed to be king he knew one
[1:02:43] thing for certain
[1:02:44] he was going to be king because the
[1:02:47] prophet told him
[1:02:48] the word told him
[1:02:53] he probably thought it over and thought
[1:02:54] well i may not live but just a few days
[1:02:56] after doing but i'm going to sit on that
[1:02:58] throne
[1:03:00] because god doesn't told me
[1:03:04] predestination made simple
[1:03:08] god before the world looked down through
[1:03:10] time and saw all that would ever take
[1:03:12] place
[1:03:14] and all it would ever be but it's like
[1:03:17] i've told you
[1:03:18] why can't you say god's over here right
[1:03:20] now looking back
[1:03:22] why can't you realize that he's here
[1:03:24] with you i thought that's what that i
[1:03:26] am meant when moses i'm asking you have
[1:03:30] you ever had a personal experience like
[1:03:31] moses with an i am at a burning bush
[1:03:37] have you ever met god and enough to
[1:03:39] worry that you know that he's real
[1:03:47] i told you about the story and all that
[1:03:49] that's what uh
[1:03:51] luke said he he likes for me to tell him
[1:03:53] stories that's one thing he like
[1:03:56] i told you the story of what happened
[1:03:57] with wade when
[1:03:59] i asked god to give some sign or someone
[1:04:01] or whatever
[1:04:02] for what i could talk to wade about his
[1:04:04] salvation
[1:04:06] and i saw a
[1:04:09] foot like of a deer
[1:04:13] where we was hunting at even the
[1:04:14] neighbor down there where you could go
[1:04:16] talk to him and
[1:04:17] he went around he said sam saw this
[1:04:19] deerfoot some way
[1:04:21] in a dream and said we just went around
[1:04:23] there behind the church and said darn
[1:04:24] enough
[1:04:25] three legs and a nub you know it didn't
[1:04:28] bother him he didn't
[1:04:30] throw off on all of it he talked about
[1:04:32] it said he saw it in a dream
[1:04:36] well see there i was all upset sitting
[1:04:38] up there in the woods because
[1:04:40] some crazy female i thought had got out
[1:04:43] there and spraying perfume everywhere
[1:04:45] because the sweetest melon you ever
[1:04:47] smell
[1:04:49] come down through them woods and i said
[1:04:52] now lord all of this that
[1:04:54] the other everything had went wrong
[1:04:55] everything in the day had went wrong
[1:04:57] just totally backwards to whatever the
[1:04:59] only thing that made me stay down there
[1:05:01] i had the only vehicle that could pull
[1:05:03] the camper
[1:05:04] so i stayed with them to whether they
[1:05:06] could get set up and everything
[1:05:08] then i left and come on home the next
[1:05:10] day you know
[1:05:12] and our wade killed this big old deer
[1:05:15] well i asked him on the way home i said
[1:05:17] do you think that's kind of unusual he
[1:05:18] said yeah
[1:05:20] that's your head i said well then let's
[1:05:22] talk a little bit because god done told
[1:05:23] me something unusual
[1:05:25] i was supposed to see that he said daddy
[1:05:27] that ain't all of it
[1:05:31] he said donald stumbled all over them
[1:05:32] woods trying to find a place to put me
[1:05:34] up and he said
[1:05:35] i couldn't use the bathroom and he said
[1:05:36] i had to use the bathroom at the base of
[1:05:38] the tree
[1:05:40] you know that's taboo
[1:05:44] and the deer come right up to where he
[1:05:45] was at and he shot him and killed him
[1:05:47] had to jump over and shoot him in the
[1:05:49] opposite side
[1:05:51] my point is what i believed
[1:05:54] god would someday come in contact with
[1:05:56] me about that
[1:05:59] because he showed me dreams and showed
[1:06:01] me things about it
[1:06:03] have you ever had anything just to be so
[1:06:05] personal
[1:06:06] and you see it come to piss
[1:06:11] you know you see it yourself something
[1:06:13] comes to price
[1:06:15] you understand what i'm driving at god
[1:06:18] come down to mo
[1:06:19] abraham so much until abraham saw a man
[1:06:24] he come so close into moses until moses
[1:06:28] met a man in a burning bush
[1:06:32] david met a man that was a king of
[1:06:34] israel
[1:06:37] and he come forth to fight the battle
[1:06:41] something personal is your salvation
[1:06:45] before the foundation of the world
[1:06:46] everybody wants to try to make it
[1:06:47] something
[1:06:48] if i was back there now i know i'll be
[1:06:50] back there well what are you trying to
[1:06:52] make it
[1:06:52] i'm trying to make it right here this is
[1:06:55] my predestination
[1:06:58] it was determined that i be here today
[1:07:01] to bring the message
[1:07:06] that's my predestination that's the way
[1:07:08] i look i look at things personal
[1:07:13] god is real
[1:07:20] he'll come to you if he'll just believe
[1:07:21] it that way
[1:07:24] but it may be in the stillness of the
[1:07:25] night it may be through somebody maybe
[1:07:27] any kind of thing
[1:07:33] he's got some reason well what was his
[1:07:36] reasoning abraham
[1:07:37] that he saw before the world ever begun
[1:07:40] that there'd be a man on the earth he'd
[1:07:42] be looking for a place for this seed to
[1:07:44] land
[1:07:45] because that's what he was doing because
[1:07:46] that was the word
[1:07:48] and he saw there was one man who would
[1:07:50] accept it
[1:07:53] two thousand years or ever what it took
[1:07:55] going before the foundation over to
[1:07:56] where
[1:07:57] abraham was
[1:08:01] and god just stops him for a minute and
[1:08:02] says abraham
[1:08:08] abraham says what
[1:08:12] i mean we look at it as a five-minute
[1:08:13] story today that god
[1:08:15] appears to abraham and then he just no i
[1:08:17] think it could have been quite a little
[1:08:18] bit and
[1:08:19] abraham was thinking it over and mulling
[1:08:21] it in his mind what's going on here
[1:08:26] he said come follow me
[1:08:30] like i say about those disciples he
[1:08:33] walks up to the disciples
[1:08:35] he says come follow me no they just
[1:08:38] throw down everything left
[1:08:44] now before the world ever begun god saw
[1:08:47] that
[1:08:49] but he knew he'd have to be there
[1:08:52] personally
[1:08:53] with them for it to ever amount to
[1:08:55] anything
[1:08:56] is your religion that personal
[1:09:05] is it personal enough to hold you
[1:09:08] when everything goes wrong
[1:09:12] brother branham did you keep your
[1:09:13] religion no no it kept me
[1:09:19] what about it
[1:09:23] just trying to get you to think about it
[1:09:31] trying to get you to think
[1:09:34] john 15 and 6 says ye have not
[1:09:38] chosen me but i chose you
[1:09:49] but now here's my point always to do it
[1:09:52] what if they hadn't accepted that as
[1:09:54] being god
[1:09:58] romans 8.
[1:10:02] in number six
[1:10:05] talking about a um jacob and esau
[1:10:11] come on just bring it on up what shall
[1:10:13] we say
[1:10:14] to these things to this
[1:10:18] is there any unrighteousness with god in
[1:10:20] other words did god choose
[1:10:25] it looks like he did because he said
[1:10:26] moses
[1:10:28] i'll have mercy on whom i'll have mercy
[1:10:29] i'll just do what i want to
[1:10:32] but does he do what he wants to
[1:10:40] does god do what he wants to do
[1:10:45] or does he know what it'll take to
[1:10:47] contact you
[1:10:54] but brother dale you talk like we need
[1:10:56] to be prophets and this that and the
[1:10:57] other well why not
[1:11:07] we'll get to it this evening about
[1:11:10] predestination
[1:11:14] god picks and chooses who what he wants
[1:11:16] to do with his gifts
[1:11:19] you agree if you don't you got a problem
[1:11:25] but gifts and callings are without
[1:11:27] repentance you don't repent to get a
[1:11:28] gift
[1:11:32] but all gifts don't come predestinated
[1:11:34] eternally
[1:11:38] all gifts come predestinated as to god
[1:11:40] knowing he's going to give them
[1:11:43] but the fifo ministry is predestinated
[1:11:45] eternally from god
[1:11:47] but yet we don't want to look at it like
[1:11:48] that
[1:11:51] but why not
[1:11:58] what made god contact you
[1:12:02] every how you want to bring it however
[1:12:04] you want to do it you want to bring it
[1:12:05] down whatever
[1:12:06] he came down one day and contacted you
[1:12:10] maybe in the still of the night maybe in
[1:12:12] some you know maybe while somebody was
[1:12:14] preaching maybe while somebody was
[1:12:17] you know directing or doing whatever
[1:12:21] all kinds of things i remember brother
[1:12:22] tatum i i used to
[1:12:24] we used to talk a lot he said i'm
[1:12:25] sitting out there on that tree
[1:12:27] and he said it just he said just like
[1:12:30] raindrops coming down
[1:12:31] on me the spirit of the lord coming
[1:12:34] present to him
[1:12:35] see it was a reality
[1:12:39] have you ever met him as real
[1:12:44] have you ever had the burning bush
[1:12:48] experience
[1:12:53] you ever been to that basis that you
[1:12:54] could feel his presence
[1:12:59] and just know that he's real
[1:13:02] i've turned around and looked to try to
[1:13:06] and then realize hey
[1:13:10] i need to just stop instead of looking i
[1:13:13] don't need to try to find him
[1:13:15] he's already found me
[1:13:19] because he's real
[1:13:22] god is real he's not just a fugitive of
[1:13:25] your imagination or some thought you
[1:13:27] have in your mind or some
[1:13:28] good point that you're thinking about
[1:13:31] he's real
[1:13:36] children just talk to him he likes to
[1:13:39] talk to you
[1:13:46] but make your calling now let me get
[1:13:47] this last point real close
[1:13:49] make your calling and election sure
[1:13:53] now what that means to me is one thing
[1:13:56] make sure of your salvation
[1:14:04] make sure of one thing that god before
[1:14:06] the world
[1:14:08] set back there and in his mind he saw
[1:14:11] everything that would ever take place
[1:14:13] he saw you sitting right here today
[1:14:16] before the world
[1:14:20] make your calling and election put it in
[1:14:21] the word of god
[1:14:23] make it real
[1:14:26] make it something that you can be proud
[1:14:27] of to do and contact that he's made with
[1:14:30] you
[1:14:38] what about it
[1:14:42] can you make your call can you put your
[1:14:44] calling because see
[1:14:45] many are called but few are chosen
[1:14:48] that's what the word says
[1:14:52] many are called why because they're
[1:14:54] called to come to him but they don't
[1:14:56] come
[1:14:57] but don't you think he knows that before
[1:14:58] the world
[1:15:05] he knew what it would take to call you
[1:15:07] to get you to stop
[1:15:10] if josh was here he could tell you a lot
[1:15:13] about his
[1:15:15] when he tried to silly oh there he is
[1:15:17] back in the corner sitting down
[1:15:22] when he tried to pass that car and
[1:15:24] wrecked up and everything
[1:15:26] two or three people stopped behind him
[1:15:28] and josh gets out of the car and
[1:15:30] that old tree i still see it every time
[1:15:32] i go by there there's a piece of bark
[1:15:33] missing about that big
[1:15:35] where he sideswiped that tree and
[1:15:40] people said where's that other guy
[1:15:44] he said what do you mean he said there
[1:15:46] was nobody in the car but me
[1:15:48] he said we saw a man i think was three
[1:15:50] people
[1:15:51] said we saw a man get out of the car and
[1:15:54] walk
[1:15:55] down through the woods
[1:15:58] well you know what it's about time to
[1:16:00] wake up
[1:16:02] when you get it like that it's time to
[1:16:03] wake up danny when you go head first off
[1:16:06] to the house of kapoor down beside of
[1:16:09] it's about time to wake up
[1:16:12] somebody's trying to get our attention
[1:16:20] it's that personal to me
[1:16:25] it's real god is real he's not just a
[1:16:28] fidget of your imagination
[1:16:31] he's real wants to talk to us he wants
[1:16:35] to fellowship with us
[1:16:37] come on musicians he wants to
[1:16:40] have a little time with me and you
[1:16:44] god loves his people he wants to talk
[1:16:48] you know he wants to fellowship with you
[1:16:51] he wants you to
[1:16:52] to accept him and let him do
[1:16:56] the rest but the first thing or all
[1:17:00] things to just remember one thing
[1:17:03] predestination looks back to
[1:17:05] foreknowledge
[1:17:07] so god before the world looked down and
[1:17:10] saw every gnat that would ever be in the
[1:17:12] world
[1:17:12] and every time it bat its eye and saw
[1:17:14] you and every day you're living
[1:17:16] but see to remember now this is what i'm
[1:17:18] saying
[1:17:19] see tomorrow's not here
[1:17:24] let's don't worry about it today
[1:17:27] is the day of salvation today is the
[1:17:30] time
[1:17:31] to make your decision to accept him as
[1:17:33] your personal savior
[1:17:36] and let him take care of the rest of it
[1:17:39] no matter what age you are how old or
[1:17:41] what he's doing
[1:17:42] he's waiting on us because he's trying
[1:17:45] to contact us
[1:17:50] could it be he's not he's not going to
[1:17:52] do everybody the same way
[1:17:53] so everybody's not going to have the
[1:17:55] same burning bush
[1:17:57] you don't have to wait to try to find
[1:17:58] you a bush somewhere to talk to god
[1:18:00] well when he does that with me i'll talk
[1:18:02] to him no no
[1:18:04] it might be anything during the night or
[1:18:06] in a day or whatever it might be
[1:18:08] might ever be something a wreck or
[1:18:10] something to happen
[1:18:11] something just happening to you because
[1:18:14] it's personal
[1:18:17] when they were in the upper room there
[1:18:19] was 120
[1:18:21] and they had little licks of fire
[1:18:24] sitting on each one of them they had
[1:18:25] something real
[1:18:28] is your experience real
[1:18:32] i'm just trying to get you to think
[1:18:34] about these things just talking
[1:18:36] about these things and saying
[1:18:38] predestination
[1:18:40] is very simple
[1:18:43] god predetermines but what he foresaw
[1:18:47] then he can set the destiny of each and
[1:18:50] every one of us
[1:18:53] but remember as he sets that destiny
[1:18:56] he's leaving you and me because we'll
[1:18:59] get to it this afternoon
[1:19:01] see faith versus knowledge temperature
[1:19:04] all those things has got to be in
[1:19:05] somebody in the end time
[1:19:08] we're the people that predestination
[1:19:10] there's never been a people
[1:19:11] predestinated unto adoption
[1:19:14] except this end time people
[1:19:18] now because even your pentecostals
[1:19:22] couldn't accept it
[1:19:25] they accepted the birth
[1:19:29] the prophet said they made their mistake
[1:19:33] by not going on
[1:19:36] see you and i are going to go somebody's
[1:19:38] going to go to a change of the body
[1:19:41] that's a predetermined position
[1:19:44] you remember the women in the bible that
[1:19:46] asked them said let our children sit
[1:19:48] here in this hour
[1:19:49] on your side in the in your kingdom he
[1:19:52] said that's not for me to give
[1:19:56] he said but it's predestinated
[1:19:59] somebody's going to be there see your
[1:20:04] predestination hangs on the basis of
[1:20:06] whether or not you can believe
[1:20:07] that it's personal to you what do we got
[1:20:09] brother joe let's stand
[1:20:11] let's just sing that song i just want to
