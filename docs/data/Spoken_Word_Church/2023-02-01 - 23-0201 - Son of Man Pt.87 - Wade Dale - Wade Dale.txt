time we love miracle healing but you know what I love the healing that goes and takes a little bit of time and you can see the working of the Lord in a man's body or a woman's body as we gradually go

remember these things uh the the receipt will be on the refrigerator when we get ready to leave so let's bow our heads we know that there's many people have needs remember Sister Freda Sister Barbara

you for this day that you give us We Appreciate You Lord we love you Lord that you we even got up this morning millions of people in this world did not have another day but Lord you gave us another day to learn from you father you gave us a time that we can sit and listen to the word of God and that you can speak to us through your word Lord we pray this to you and anoint the people that they can hear Lord anoint the speaker that he can speak father and it'd be you speaking Lord and not us father be with the ones that are sick that are not here Lord sister Johnny different ones Lord that

going to speak to us and that you'll be with us Lord be with the missionaries on the Foreign Fields Lord keep them safe give them fruit for their labor father and Louise and for Luis and brother Bob I pray that you'll give them fruit Lord for their labor as they labored over there Lord in Nicaragua Lord we pray that you'll just be with them Lord we thank you for all the things you give us that you be that we are able to send brothers and sisters over there and to be able to spread the word of God and spread the truth not spread a fable and spread a lie or spread an idea but to spread the gospel as you told us to do that go into all the world and preach the gospel and then the end will come father we pray Lord hasten that day forgive us of our sins and bless us Lord in Jesus name amen part 87 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwell Among Us I'm gonna read you a quote not today but where brother Robin said the flesh is becoming word words becoming flesh so it's all got to unite back together it's a uniting time we've been separated we're going to read here in a few minutes how Adam and Eve got separated from God all right because they ate off of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil God separated from it but he made a way for him to get back praise the Lord he made a way for him to get back I will I will I will be the one that'll do it and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seeing when the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word John 8 verse 31 then Jesus said to those disciples which believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth not know of the truth not suppose you might know the truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen so if you'll bring the chart up we'll look at it just for a few minutes and I I appreciate the Lord giving us Grace to have these things that we can put up so that you can visually see what's going on and you can see here it is oh if you bring if you oh yeah thank you if your gas for the banquet will be at church on Sunday in other words we're like Joel and Pam's going to be coming with us be sure to bring enough lunch for yourself and your guest you sure don't want them sitting there not eating anything while we're all eating okay that'd be hard for a guest to do to Fellowship after that one service thank you sister Gene she's got it all up here amen so now we saw the other day where that middle round the soul of man is the center Realm where the actually where the sinner lives if you're not born again all right and then we looked and and it was it was just a real eye-opener to me to see that the affection this affection Right Here cannot be the affection that is in here this is agape love this is filial love this is conditional love one day you'll love me one day you won't love me one day you'll like me one day you won't like me up and down up and down up and down reasoning up and down up and down memory bad and good right conscious bad ain't good imagination oh boy but that is either Faith or doubt either your soul is Born Again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost or it is a doubter of the word of God it was born in doubt we're going to see in just a few minutes it was born in sin that's what separated when Adam knew his wife Eve that broke it all now we know it did with the serpent but when Adam did it that broke it off to where nobody could get back no one it was they were totally barred away from God now bye with me but he said I will restore now what's he going to restore he's going to restore this life right here first then he's going to restore these and I like where it says the gifts of the Spirit which is what love joy peace long suffering all the different things but remember it's not agape love there's a one of those questions it talks about the Holy Spirit right here the pyramid top of the pyramid and we'll get to that that's where it Seals Everything in if there's any cracks that's where it's going to seal of them if there's anything that's going to be shaken it can't be shaken once that Holy Ghost Seals Everything into that pyramid or you when I say pyramid I'm talking about you everybody with me it's not a building not a pyramid over there it's you all right when it's sealed into you you say we already got the Holy Ghost I got it down here yeah but you get a refilling you get to where God says I can use this guy now because I've got everything sealed into him and look can't get out praise God see that's why we say we have so many ups and downs and ups and downs God don't have ups and downs only me and you have ups and downs God don't have a bad day and a good day if we'd let our soul out every once in a while and let it live let it do the speaking let it do the teaching remember what he said he was going to do send us a holy ghost to do what lead us and guide us into all truth the leader is right here that's where the Holy Ghost is this is not Holy Ghost this is your spirit now the holy spirit's working on your spirit working its way out to get into this realm but so is Satan working to get in from the outside to affect your imagination to affect your reasoning to affect your Consciousness he's trying to affect and infect you and me but he can't get in that Soul once it's sealed in listen that's the throne room that's where God will meet you at because the devil can meet you in all those other in that Spirit realm the devil can meet you there but if you're born again of the spirit of God he cannot meet you in that holy of holies it will burn him so bad because that's what's going to burn him up at the end time what's going to burn him so bad is that Holy Ghost Fire is what's going to burn him up because remember he's getting put in the Lake of Fire he's not putting it like a fire that's burning fire it burned him up and consume him he'd be dead he'd be gone no it's a lake of fire that burns a holy fire that's going to burn him until whatever time it is that God says okay that's enough and he'll just evaporate into nothing boy we don't want that we don't want to evaporate into nothing I I don't want that I don't want you to be that way I want us to all make it I want us to all if we're going to evaporate I want to evaporate in the Holy Ghost amen that's I'm gonna evaporate give me the Holy Ghost and I'll evaporate away from here and you'll see the real me not me that's talking to you today all right so the spirit Realm thank God he sent us a prophet but he sent us the word we say he sent us a prophet but really he sent us the word through a prophet everybody with me he sent us the correct interpretation of the word through a prophet to give it to me and you in what truth you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free like I said before no one you don't see anybody I'm not talking about well even messaged people almost now talking about Statue of perfect man but out in the world they're just it's they're just all gummed up well it's okay if I do this it's okay if I do that you know I can drink and I can smoke and I well you ain't perfect neither am I so forget you leave me alone this this right here this no that didn't make you do anything it's the motivator inside is what made you do that all right everybody with me so these virtues though must emanate or come from here they don't come from the outside they're already inside of you that's why a lot of people feel that you just get the virtues when you get born again and you don't need all this teaching of Faith virtue and all those tempered faces Godless brother kindness there is a group of people that doesn't believe they believe you got it all brother Dale remember there's one group that believe you got it all when you believe that's another group believes you got to get the virtues before you get to right here they turn the pyramid upside down uh been in the room with both of them and and the wisdom of dad was like I ain't fighting with you and I ain't fighting with you but can we pull them together can we pull them together and say yeah you got everything when you believe because that's a quote but you got to let that work out to where these virtues can work in this realm right here not in this realm in this realm but it's kind of imminent you got to let it out and what's going to let it out knowledge teaching is going to let that out because we're going to see something in just a minute that's really shocking that was that happened when Adam and Eve did what they did in the garden because remember before Adam fell Adam and Eve fell everything was perfect Adam could walk right up to God look at him face to face and say Hey Dad how you doing God said hey I'm doing good come on let me let me take you over here remember brother Ryan visualized it says Adam and Eve right at the end of the day God just lays them down puts them to sleep he said you sleep there I'll come back and get you in the morning everything was perfect harmony was great there was no fear inside of Adam there was nothing that that gets what he called butterflies there was no butterflies when God walked up now you don't if God walked through that door right there we'd have butterfly but I'm gonna promise you he's already walked through that door do you have butterflies I don't think so because he's hidden in you and me I mean how are we going to be able to commune with God when we get on the other side because we're going to be rid of this Humanity because we're going to look at two things that happened to Adam that he already had in his body but they were released when what happened in the garden we'll talk about in just a second but you see that the soul is the most important guy brother Brown said if God can never get that soul to stand still long enough a couple of you have told me that during this when we were talking about the the new birth that you got the new birth because of listening to the teaching not just of me but of all of us oh how that soul is the one that needs to be saved your spirit realm can be fooled your spirit realm can be fooled into believing you're a believer but when that Soul ever gets the new birth that's not make believe that's true believing and you just gotta let it out because it's still it's still encased in this Humanity it's still encased in negativism it's still encasing uh brother Joel Forney why is he was you woo there's no Ozil as you will in your soul if you're born again so let that thing out release it let it do his job because we're gonna see in just a minute how your body releases something when it's fearful but it also releases something to calm you down your own body Adam had it when it was made he just never had to use it because he'd never been separated from God no fear hey Daddy how you doing good I'm good I'm and Adam knew he was God he didn't know he didn't say well is there another person or something no he knew that was God because God came down and spoke to Adam in the cool of the day and as brother Brown says how you doing Adam had a good day oh wave you just look so good y'all my perfect children well boy something changed though a little bit later and we'll look at it it's called sin but it was called eating off the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil not the Tree of Life but God promised us and I want you to see this I will restore to you the years in other words 2 000 years that this bug has eat all these and eat it down to a stomp it almost killed him in the Dark Ages and almost cut the light out but God said I will restore in other words I'm going to bring that thing back up out of a stump because the life's in The Roots they couldn't pull the roots out because God said I will restore what's he going to restore the gift to you he's going to restore happiness to you he's going to restore these virtues to you so that you know how to be happy they some people in this world do not know how to be happy if you were to present happy to him they just throw it away if you could put in a box and hand it to him they go oh really Jim's sister is the same way bless her heart if she was completely healed of everything she wouldn't know what to do she'd still be miserable right misery loves what company so let's don't be miserable people that's why I like to hang that's why I like to get good holy ghost-filled friends I know we have certain friends out in the world that we have to deal with they're not friends like you guys are they're not friends like we we are as a as a body of Believers we are not just friends we're family members right all right so he's going to restore and we know what he's going to restore the canker worm eat it caterpillar remember it's the same worm so it's the same devil but you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of your God that half dwell what wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed Are you ashamed to be a Christian Are you ashamed that they talk about you Are you ashamed are you really I mean you're ashamed come on Paul says I'm not ashamed of this gospel in which I've been given to preach I'm not I'm ashamed of it as I've said before I'm not ashamed of this man message I'm not ashamed to be a follower of William Branham people there don't tell me first no they won't get it first but you kind of come around somewhere and if they truly are interested in what you're saying they'll say would you get that from that's where'd you get that from I got a place I found a church age book downstairs and you know what I'm gonna do there's a place there on on on Joe Chandler Road going to Gainesville there's a little lady there who's got a little box you see that Mom that Joe y'all you see a little yellow box well I know the lady because she was on my mail route before and she's really a sweet lady but she puts books in there she says take one leave one so I'm gonna go out there and take one and I'm Gonna Leave a church age book and I'm gonna make sure you I'm gonna write up Donnie fabush's name on it and uh didn't you put your address and your phone number call me anytime day or night foreign but I'm gonna do that I'm gonna slip on him I didn't think we had any churches books downstairs but we do have a few so I'm gonna stick one if that's all right I mean put one in there hey if I take one they may they may become a Believer you never know you know how many miracles we've seen of people overseas that somebody throw the book Away in a toilet or in a bathroom and they use part of it for toilet paper but the other half was left praise God the bottom half was left that told him where to go word of God publication or wherever it was or or over in Jeffersonville at the time it's been many years ago and they called it now they're a message preacher and got a big message church somewhere over overseas so so praise God he can get people anyway right what America work and God we have 28 says Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and draw them from the breast we'll get to this just in a few minutes but I want to reiterate this when we look at that word knowledge do not think of worldly knowledge because worldly knowledge has no value but brother mom said holy ghost virtue Holy Ghost knowledge the the knowledge of Jesus Christ not the knowledge of your neighbor the knowledge of of Einstein not that that will that will actually get you killed God is eaten off the wrong tree but we got to have Holy Ghost knowledge to be able to what discern right from wrong in your little in your little world everybody with me all right you discern it from what the word of God and thank God for a prophet that could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart but thank God for a Bible that tells us you can do the same thing not in a way like used to be before but every one of us has a certain amount of discernment if you'll just let the Lord do it and you listen to him all right all right well we're coming to adoption and that's what we're we'll probably talk about Saturday a little bit because the question was what is that Holy Spirit up there for well that is what to place you into adoption is to put you in a place where God can use you all right nobody with me that's what we're heading towards because you can't take a doc you can't not be adopted and then The Headstone come and fit down where it's supposed to fit I know some of you didn't didn't get that but that's what we're working toward we're working toward getting because look this right here can't fall on this look at the look at the shape this is a perfect shape and when it sets down it's going to sit down right on brother I'm calls it a flange sort of fit over it so it'll shed the water what shed the water your life so this knowledge is not knowledge of the world it is good to have knowledge do not take your kids out of school please give them an education if you homeschool them that's great if you send them to public school that's fine but educate your kids all right then also integrate education as back here in the Sunday school class and downstairs in the Sunday school class and up here in the Sunday school class and 9 45 to four o'clock on Sunday you just get a good old you know you get a whole bunch of curriculum going on here and then on Wednesday night too with all these brothers preaching and to me it's a treasure Trove of true knowledge not just knowledge there's true knowledge Satan's got knowledge Satan's got knowledge of the Bible he knows the Bible he knows the message of the hour but this is producing God not producing another person it's producing the same person like I said before it's not two-ness we're not we're not Tunis we're producing Jesus Christ back again in the church that ought to make you happy that's what we're heading toward not toward another man we're heading toward Jesus Christ so knowledge II Peter 1 verse 5 says beside this giving all diligence in other words what am I saying besides this besides your new birth knowledge see knowledge at the new birth is that water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is right and then what Peter said Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for your mission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for that promise that's a promise not right here that's a promise down here I promise to give you the teacher now I know as well as y'all do some of y'all didn't listen to your teachers in school it's obvious I did Brother George I was a straight A student now my family can't even fathom that but but I made it straight A didn't make a beetle I got in college but I studied knowledge but holy ghost and all that see that knowledge didn't do nothing but take me away from God that knowledge I learned in school if I'd have just stayed with that it took me away from God and it did take me away from God but the knowledge that we're talking about here it takes you not just to God it takes you up into God it takes you up into his mind that's why brother Adam said let's go back in the back part of God's mind he said let's go by he didn't say I'm gonna go biting and shut it when I get done he said let's go back in the back part of God's mind he brought us into the mind of God that's why we're feeding off the unfailing body word of the son of man the person of Jesus Christ besides this what besides the New Birth the knowledge you need to be baptized the knowledge you need to cut that knowledge is not knowledge to tell you to come to church right right that's right that knowledge is above that you should buy the new birth know to come to church sorry so this knowledge is separated from that knowledge because this knowledge everywhere we look we see that it's a furtherment look such as belongs to the more advanced you can put that yeah you got it over there you can take that down if you want to miss Abby Grace but it belongs to the more advanced knowledge that we're talking about in the Statue of perfect man especially if things lawful and unlawful for Christians you know what the world's lost that though the World by their knowledge has told them they could wear pants if you're a woman and you can cut your hair if you're a woman and you're fine now that's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that's not the Tree of Life moral wisdom such as this scene and what right living Genesis 2 9. and now the ground made the Lord God grow every tree Pleasant to the site good for food now that's the trees that's got roots then now he's talking about the tree of knowledge the Tree of Life which is Jesus Christ also in the midst of the garden of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil they were right there they were intertwined it took it took someone to tell you which one was right and wrong because you know what folks I'm telling you something when I say the tree of life and I say the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil I'll bet you in your mind in your brain you got one beautiful tree and one ugly one come on somebody dream of knowledge of Good and Evil Tree of Life no no no they were the same as you looked at it twins twins I believe even brother Brown and I'll try to look it up I think he said one time that their their limbs were intertwined because it was so close that tree of life was not over here and it was shining and big old apples and fruit and this one over here with some Dead stick no that one was probably more beautiful than that because that's what got even trouble that didn't that didn't make her do what she did that did because of beauty we'll read it in just a minute Genesis 2 6 and the Lord commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou May freely eat any tree you want to but in the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat for the day you eat that day you shall die that tree is a death tree not a life tree all right so we know knowledge means the fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity look gain to experience not just not just acts 2 38. that's down at the bottom that's it faith that's knowing you need to be born again that's the knowledge that you're lost that's not that knowledge that knowledge at that point is not telling you you're lost it's telling you how to be a better Christian everybody with me without the circumstance or condition of apprehending Truth or fact through reasoning John 8 verse 31 say Jesus said to the Jews that believe in him if you continue in my word then you are my disciple disciples indeed and you shall know the truth now this is where we're going to get to and you shall know the truth and the truth will make you free I want you to pay attention here just a few minutes I may have to say some words that I don't want to but this is going to be you know what that word know is and the Greek Lexicon is perceive or understand or get knowledge of but I'm going to make a point here in just a second to understand perceive have knowledge of to understand it's a Jewish idiom for sexual intercourse between a man and a woman Bible says what Adam knew his wife Eve now it wasn't that he knew her shook her hand said hey how you doing no ain't known her for ages but he knew her in a different way there had never been before Genesis 3 6 is when the woman saw that the tree was good for food which tree pretty tree not Tree of Life pretty tree and that it was pleasant to the eyes never seen a tree that made me do that so this must have been a person with a Doctrine I'm going to tell you something that Beast was probably extremely beautiful he was right between an eight or an ape and a man so he was just he was just Pleasant to the eye because that's where it came from a tree to be desired to make one wise oh Eve be careful you're fixing to know something you don't want to know she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband in other words he in other words he knew her right in Genesis 3 he says Adam knew his wife Eve and they had children and the eyes of them both watched the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked now they had walked thousands maybe millions of years completely naked I can't fathom that without something going on think about it and I don't believe he said now don't touch me you stay over there no that was his buddy that was his wife that was his partner they just had no carnal name to what release something into their bloodstream we'll talk about just a minute to make them do what they did everybody with me but I want to make sure that you know this it's not just this is not just this is knowledge up here this is not knowledge down at the bottom of the pyramid and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked do you want in other words I had a new understanding a new knowledge that they'd never had before and they sold figures in other words they had a feeling that's why feelings will get you in trouble kids do not kiss before marriage prophet of God knew exactly what he was talking about and they heard the voice of the Lord walking in the garden now they had done this many times years hundreds and thousands of years they had heard that voice Walking In the Garden of Eden and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called into Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid never had he felt that before and I got to looking around a little bit when you're afraid your body releases a chemical it's called cortisol everybody with me it comes from a gland in your body that's already there it's what was already an atom's body because God knew they had to be perfect human being so he got all held the parts and he had everything inside of it but it usually comes from your adrenal gland and what happens is when you get excited it releases cortisol it's a traumatic stress or fear drug or whatever you want to call it but it's released into your body Adam had never had that released in his body before he had it in him why was it released because of the knowledge that he eat off of that tree Peter stayed with that tree he did not had that right anybody with me same way with me and you which one are you going to eat off of that one or that one I don't want something foreign relief in my body but cortisol but what happens too though it comes from your pituitary gland and it releases also though cortisol is released that's where the fear comes from but your body automatically releases another one and it's about this long but it releases one to calm you down already inside your body that's why fear comes from inside you I fear I'm sorry Lord I'm afraid I've got this feeling I've never had before when are we gonna get rid of that because if your body this is my point if your body can create inside of you a chemical to react to that guess what can't you take the Holy Ghost and do the same thing why should you fear why does it ain't fear not in other words do not release don't let your body release that cortisol you're going to get you're going to get afraid but fear not then also there's a drug called serotonin I know it's named for Sarah Roberts but serotonin Works about the same way in other words what happens when somebody gets high that dopamine that's why they call it dope it's putting your body in such high levels it makes you have a state of euphoria and your body can't produce enough drugs inside of you not out there inside of you to calm it down So Adam come to a place he was he had a feeling he'd never had before he was afraid he had the knowledge of Good and Evil not the knowledge of the Tree of Life so you and I were born with that inside of our body that cortisol and and serotonin there's a lot of different things that does but that's just two things that that react in your body that's already there it's already there in the gland just waiting on you to either get fit get afraid or calm you down of course they make drugs to do that too but what does it do it affects those cortisol you can actually take serotonin as a supplement but you see what happened here's my point we've all got everything inside of us to either be fearful or release that other drug the Holy Ghost to calm it down that's why that's why fear not Jesus walked up to him said fear not look don't release that because you're going to think differently how many times you've been just going along everything's cool everything's good and then all of a sudden boom a car hits you or or you ain't paying attention like boy and hit your head on something what does it do it releases that drug inside of you the court is all the different things to make you fearful and then your body has to counter react that when you're sitting here today what's being released in your body today natural versus spiritual are you letting fear overtake what God's already given you are you letting fear do that because Adam did Adam knew he'd done wrong and his body released a drug that said I was afraid you and I are going to have to remember one thing when God said fear not that's what's going to take us to a body change because we death is going to go up our sleeve and that cortisol is not going to come out brother Brown said we'd wipe it off wipe it off wipe it off wipe off death you say death and you got this little quiver inside of you right every time you say well he's gonna die oh my Lord all right I got this I got to go to the doctor and I don't know if that thing's a cancer or not fear brings what torment let's quit letting Satan torment us that's what I was getting rather um brother Daryl was and that's what was released to me from that is just just fear not Don't Fear The Thing right my brother but I'm saying why fear cancer because cancer is that thing when you say cancer it's like you're dead you're dead no it's not dead it's just a word it's a word for a devil and it releases cortisol and then that cortisol if you keep letting it get fearful what's going to happen is you're going to have a nervous breakdown stop that business I'm talking natural and Spirits you're gonna have a spiritual break now if you don't get in the word of God and let that release into your life yeah press play when you want to but listen to a good Holy Ghost Field preacher it'll do the same thing it'll release something inside of you that you don't know that you've got because if Adam was the first if he was the first Adam and that happened to him what happened to the second Adam he reversed that process and then where did he reverse to that in me and you take her back to the Garden of Eden take her back to no fear can you believe that hey now what brother Brown said all God was you pouring into Christ oh Christ was he poured into the church the bride to take her back to the Garden of Eden with no fear but we got to have what death destroyed here not there everybody with me just remember that even even as we look at I've read that many many that quote many many times where brother Brown says the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass when you have a negative attitude it releases in your body a real enzyme or a real substance that your body's got to react to that's my brother Brown what he's look he'd look at the women he say you've got a nervous condition and it's caused by menopause or it's caused by a member he told that one lady he said look I know your problem he said you're scared of dogs he said because when you were a little kid a dog either bitched you or run you know run at you and scared you it put fear it put that that cortisol or the serotonin put everything inside of her and every time she saw a dog that's why sometimes you talk about things I had a dream one time when I was a kid I had a dream that somebody's chasing me through the woods with an ax wasn't my brother wasn't my daddy what my mama could have been Anna but he was a little bit taller he was taller than that but I caught him I flipped him over and I hit him right here with that ax and when he bust open it was just like a piece of wood there was nothing like guts or it was just like when I split him he split like a like a uh a log and every time I go through the woods even hunting and man through the even in dark and even with a good flashlight and even with pop standing beside me I'm like why because I had that dream so many years ago and I can remember it I probably went in Jonas's age we were still living in uh in Gillsville on top of the hill so we moved there from there in 72. so I was just a kid but that impacted me so much till I hear you hear leaves crunching behind you it releases a lot of cortisol and you go why because of this an experience that you had before we've got to overcome that fear that the devil's the one that was behind us and he's the one that's chasing us but praise God I jerked that sucker around throwing him on the ground hit him in the head and busted him wide open and you know what there was nothing in him he's a bluff the word knowledge is one did not know something until that fact had a practical outworking in his life that's what knowledge this knowledge is it will have a practical outworking in your life it will not make you come to church more when you get the Holy Ghost that's when you start need to come to church more not here this is knowledge to tell you why you need to keep going more and more happy as a man that findeth wisdom and the man that geteth understanding for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and fine gold she now turns into a she is more precious who's she she's the bride she is more precious than rubies and all things thou cast desire not to be compared unto her Length of days is in her right hand and then her left hand Rich is an honor her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her pastor peace doesn't that sound pretty good she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy as everyone that retaineth her brother Brown said you're a Creator right you can change an atmosphere of a room just by walking in it if you've got the right attitude before you go in it that's why brother Brown said you need to pray you need to do whatever you need to do before you come through them doors because you're either gonna go leave worse or you're going to leave better you're either going to lay that thing down throw it away get something from God and go out the door are you going to bring it in here and you're going to let it absolutely you're going to have gallons and gallons of cortisol running through your body okay much less the devil and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more what in knowledge and all judgment as I said before dare any one of you take a matter to another to court in other words don't go to law before the unjust and not before the Saints do you not know that the Saints will judge the world that's why we judge matters here we don't let the law judge matters Between Brothers now for them out there it says go to law before the unjust in other words don't you can't take something that we can deal with here and take it to a judge and have him decide in a Christian manner how to do something because most times that judge is not going to be a Christian he's going to look at the law and say that's it all right we believe in grace I I well I do I believe in grace amen do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters know you not that you shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life if then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church in other words let the new guy do it pay it before the new guy if he's got the Holy Ghost that's what it says we'll read it the least esteemed in the church that's your perfect man brother Brown says and thirdly add knowledge knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to God but knowledge to what judge judge right from wrong how do you judge it then if you've got Christian knowledge with your virtue and Faith you judge whether the word is right or wrong but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory that you can say that and can see that by the revelation of God the whole word is wrote in Mysteries and only the knowledge of God can reveal it now what we said before there's no prevailing power but a revelation that's that's what you need to pray for you don't need to pray for anything else but revelation God I'm already born if I'm already Born Again God give me a revelation I want to know more and how do you know more about him you get it revealed to you right it's that aha moment that you should say man I haven't seen that I might see it now we ought to be so happy when that happens that God the Creator the one that wrote it in mystery form he wrote it took from the wise and prudent but revealed It To Me and You by Holy Ghost knowledge not by the knowledge of the world thank you Lord have you ever just thanked God for that I mean there's some walking idiots around here I'm not talking about here I'm coming out in the world their whole mentality it's just totally messed up right and you know what they say we're crazy we'll find out only the knowledge of God can reveal it that when you get and say punctuate every word of God with an amen some of y'all ought to try that then add that to your faith 70 weeks today and your brother Brian says look the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the what of the Holy Ghost revelation of the Holy Ghost not Revelation that you need the Holy Ghost okay the Revelation that you need to Holy Ghost is right here the Revelation that you got the Holy Ghost and it can help you is right here that's going up that's moving up in God the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day we're living in we ought to know what day we're living in we're living in the last hours of the last day 30 Seconds To Midnight like brother brother Daryl was talking about it was three minutes when brother Branham was here now it's 30 seconds do you all know what that is it's an atomic clock like it's it's closer to be if it turns to midnight there's going to be an atomic war so we're only 30 seconds away from that and praise God brother Brown said not one bomb will fall get out of this thing take the fear everybody's afraid of it you say Atomic it's like cancer you go he ain't happened to the bride until we're out of here so don't even listen to that garbage all that talk about nuclear this and nuclear that oh the world's going to get a nuclear this and that but you and me are not going to be here if you are here you missed it [Music] the Holy Spirit comes to the church in the last days to reveal these great deep secret things do you understand now I believe in this church we've had that for years and years and years and I pray that we'll continue to hold that all together that we can have some good deep teaching listen you ought to know how to worship some of y'all been in the message 50 years you ought to know how to worship some of you has been in the message two years you ought to know how to worship because you got to worship her inside of you amen so let's get past that part there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him Spirit of wisdom and understanding now this is the person that's going to die for you and release his life back into you not a second person not part of him all of him because remember collectively we are what we are the fullness of the godhead bodily collectively not one person he divided himself under that Pentecost and he just keeps dividing and keeps dividing and keep dividing the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and what of the fear of the Lord it's okay to fear of the Lord that doesn't release the cortisol that brings you up in God and it helps you not release cortisol because if Adam would have had to fear the lord he'd have been okay but he had the fear of Adam he had the fear of Adam in him when he said I fear ah not you me I I fear you Lord because I've done something wrong Ephesians 1 verse 17 the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him Sister Barbara was quoting a quote today on WhatsApp if some of you saw that and and she's listening in or watching in then uh Oh Sister Gail said tell everybody hey I think she's she's talked call Jim talked to her yesterday or so but I miss sister Gail we always forget to to say sister Gail when we say sister um when we say sister Freda and we say sister Johnny but also sister Gail she's watching in so she's keeping up with us she's still there she's real faithful just just pray for her that may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints God's inheritance is living inside of you if you're born again you are the inheritance of God and we keep going talk about the Book of Revelations there's nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word we can't live without revelation right we can't we dry up and backslide well I'll preach anyway we all do it's not gonna pop like popcorn and we're gonna get a revelation but like little sister Barbara was going putting she actually put two quotes together so she's not gonna find one quote just like that but brother Brown says when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here she'll become an invincible Army but he also said in um 1953 I believe it was in questions and answers he said he said that that when the door of the Gentile church is closed God or what anoint a church then so there's two different quotes there but there are nice to put them together it's okay I don't mind that that's good but but he'll what do in one year what theologists has tried to do in 2000 years he's doing it now though he's not going to wait he's had to start somewhere he started with the prophet's message and you and I are recipients of that if you believe that so there's no prevailing power as the revelation of the word and I say through the message of the hour through the message of the hour that's what I'm reading I'm reading the message of the hour keep going just to save time but the prevailing overcoming church is built on Revelation so we can expect God look we can expect God to reveal his truth to us expectation that God's going to give you a revelation God help me I've got questions put somebody in the Pulpit they'll answer these questions put somebody you can tell me somebody over breakfast put somebody in front of me that'll help me help me have you ever done that no you got to get desperate enough to want it yeah I can't live without knowing about God oh yeah we know about all these other things sure sure I like to read about this for like the cortisol and the serotonin and different things and I like to read about stuff like that but there's no prevailing power in that it just helps for you to understand certain things that goes on in your body all right however you actually don't need a revelation of water baptism it's right there staring you in the face Revelation to Jesus Christ churches book brother I'm saying we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything in the world he said how you want to get closer to God brother Brown said pray and read your Bible if you pray and read your Bible I promise you God will give you a revelation he'll answer your question we have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truths of it but it still is not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there I'm just quoting quotes I'm quoting what brother Brown said because most people the revelation of the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened listen pile it in though pile it in store it up in your Storehouse not some Storehouse over here somewhere not Jeffersonville sorry about that start up inside of you jeffersonville's not taking a Rapture you are ampersand the Bible says in Corinthians 5 21 that we have become the righteousness of God by our Union with Jesus Christ did you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ that's a revelation because listen every other quote is from the Bible born in sin shaping iniquity on your way to hell contrary to God Peter Paul said born contrary to God born what's that all Paul says whoremongers uh he lists a whole bunch of really nice people not really but you know what he said such for some of you but you're washed if you'll believe it you're sanctified you're born again that unclean spirits out of your soul now let's work on the next guy it says that we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ it says that he Jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but he became sin for us that by our Union with him what's the union knowing him intimate relationship Jesus said hey you shout my name you can cast out Devils you can have prayer lines you can have all these different things you want that's okay needful until you don't need it needful until you don't need it because you can't take laying on hands out of the Bible or you take it's about peace of the Bible out all right but we got to come to a place though we're like Gentile though just say the word just say the word just say the word I know I'll get something you just say the word all right he became sin for us that we by our Union with him so what are we doing he's taking on our sin we're taking on his righteousness do you really believe that you better believe it if we accept the fact and we must say it with me and we must that was poor and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we buy our Union with him have become the very righteousness of God to reject one is to reject the other to accept one is to accept the other now we know the Bible says that it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing let's get born again let's get that Revelation down then let's go to the Revelation that's missing of knowledge stay away from the Tree of knowledge get to the Tree of Life know which ones which you know what brother Brown you know continuation of the quote is that brother Brown says when the church realizes who she is and what she's doing she'll be an invincible Army when she gets a true revelation of the two spirits in the framework of this church discharge this church will be what an invincible Army because you know what Satan will be totally thwarted he said because he won't have anything to work in because he's still working on that Spirit Realm but there's going to be a day folks I promise you somebody's going to make it you just got to believe it's you but you got to go by the required curriculum you can't make it like brother Brown said and I'll read it to you later on not now where brother Brown says you can't jump up if you get way up here and it breaks he said down here he said you're gonna fall you got to be solidified all the way up that's why when you get up there to that part of the Holy Spirit you're a rock he sealed you in and he's going to be able to use you till the day of your Redemption but the revelation of it is missing and it's not real look to the majority of Satan's kids I didn't say that it is not real to the majority of God's children why they're still children it is just a good verse in the Bible Acts 2 38. but we need to have it made alive to us that will take a revelation Hebrews 5 13 is for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe that doesn't say you're it doesn't say you're lost it said you're just unskillful God sends a preacher by now see that's another thing I want to make this point Thank you Lord for bringing that back you know when you're sitting here in a service not so much this church but other places thank God and then you have a preacher that comes out and he preaches about be have an eternal seat you know something that you've not been taught something that you know is a little bit wrong what goes off cortisol your body releases something to say something ain't right amen where's that release from it's released from your body but it's by the Holy Ghost by the Holy Ghost inside of you because you know what there's hundreds of people sitting around you that believe that same thing they had a different feeling than you did there was something released different than was what was released in you ever had that little they call it butterflies but you ever had a little thing like man that ain't something about that's not right hey man [Music] 600 people shouting scream and 10 of us just sat there why did we just sit there we were taught right we weren't fearful we had no fear I promise you you start talking about Daniel 70 weeks a lot of stuff goes off some of you ministers you've been in the ministers a lot of stuff goes off and it ain't good don't smell good don't look good they start blowing up all over the place why there's something released in their body that they're not used to they're fearful that they don't have the answer or they have this defense mechanism is well you don't know anything and I don't know anything and that's not your Revelation that's whatever but strong meat belongs why is that why does that trigger go off because not knowledge down here it's not saying that those people are not born again it's saying they don't have the knowledge complete knowledge of the truth not de-christianizing people we are not listen you can be wrong in your Doctrine and be baptized with the Holy Ghost and have the new birth but you can't have the word presented to you and stay that way and have the new birth but strong meat belongs to them that are of what full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised get your faith muscles have them exercise by what to discern both Good and Evil if everything was good we'd be happy but when that evil pops up we're able to discern there's something goes off in your soul in your holy ghost that says what that's not right or listen or less reason together let's study this thing out let's see where the difference is I like what brother Brown said brother Brown said look you both can't be right you can both be wrong but one of you can't be wrong another one right one right another wrong if you're wrong it's wrong but both of you can't have two opinions on the word of God and they both be right can't happen sorry about that discern is what to separate make a distinction discriminate prefer that's why we had a teacher that taught us how to rightly divide the word of truth I'm talking about brother Ryan I'm going to talk about brother Dale talking about the rest of y'all sitting here a progression of teachers that taught us every little Dot and every little comma and everything even the A's and these we understand that because we can separate rally dividing the Bible says the word of Truth for the word of God is quick and Powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even through the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit that's why we can look at that chart and by the prophet's message we'll be able to understand that we can separate those two because I promise you folks most people you can't separate them you cannot okay you can't separate them as far as pull them apart and say all right we're going to put the soul over here we're going to put the spirit over here and the body here and we're going to analyze it no you're a unit without the soul you're dead without the spirit it has nothing to move with this has something to move but it's moved by my spirit if that spirit's not in here guess what you'll be saying boy he looks good piercing even look dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints in Maryland listen the whole body can be discerned by the word of God joints marrow everything the whole body and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart we got to use that discernment though to figure out what what's false and what's true now look that's why that is unskillful the knowledge down here that we get at the new birth it is unskillful because it can be fooled the soul can't be fooled but the spirit can be fooled as a baby babies make mistakes all the time right you know what somebody said one time and I agree if you were to take my pretty little cat I'm gonna get tomorrow and you put that cat right here as a little bitty baby and it will not fall off of that it'll stay right there or it'll walk around this way you lay a baby right there it moves it's gonna fall what does that mean cats are more intelligent than humans but you see what happens though we that's what I'm trying to say God protects nature it does it he protects nature because they don't have a soul but with a soul there's a decision made and we are the consequence of that decision all right even there shall be false teachers among you who privately shall bring in damnable heresies we see that in the message already even denying the Lord that bought them and bringing them upon themselves Swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious prediction that's what that word is pernicious ways or wrong ways by reason of whom the way of Truth look even the way of truth will be evil spoken of they're bashing this message like crazy truth the very true their passion they're saying this listen there's no need to fighting them they're going to get their due right let's move on keep going quit looking back if a soldier Falls he falls right if he dies you got to leave him there if he's wounded pick him up and help him but if not you got to go forward we got to move forward we can't turn around and go back we don't been too far to turn back now I love that song gone too far turn back now Hebrews 5 11 says of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing that you're a dull of hearing now listen that's slothful slow sluggish into let and languid in other words behind but now that don't mean dull of hearing because I'm getting hard of hearing I can't hardly hear the alarm clock go off in this ear oh I mean it goes off all the time it's not the real alarm clock well no they only had that problem before you never had a ringing in your ear and go somebody said answer that oh wait well okay never mind then we all pray for me I got to go to the doctor about it but that's not Dull of hearing that way it's dull of hearing because you sit here and you die the word of God's preached to you and you let it go right through you and out the back door you don't listen to what the preacher's saying you have your own preconceived idea and it just goes right on through but when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God what the Ten Commandments that was the first principle of the Oracle of God think the Ten Commandments and I become such as what have need of milk and not of strong me that's where we get to Holy Ghost knowledge that's why that knowledge is not down here that knowledge is on up above that where we don't have to listen excuse me the the church at Ephesus 12 people they all had the Holy Ghost and they all were taught by Paul so I would say they all had the virtues working in their life because that's the faith of the fathers and Paul was part of the father is everybody with me so he taught them and they were a powerful Church 12 people they didn't just have the Holy Ghost they had the Holy Ghost Plus they had the Holy Ghost plus they were Top by profit me and you we're supposed to go back to that that's the only time we go back I believe it comes and gets us hey man everybody all right sorry but having a form of godliness but denying the power of thereof that's what's happened to people in the message now you see people being a message 30 and 40 years they're denying the message what they had a form of godliness but they're denying the power that's behind the message ask the Bible but denying the power that look from such turn away for this sort are they which creep into houses yours leading captive silly churches Laden with sins LED away with many lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth Hebrews 10 verse 23 he said let us hold fast the profession of what our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works not forsaken them who put that in there again not forsaken they're sending of ourselves together as a matter of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching you know you see people and and I you know I I harp on this a lot but you see people that struggle if they would just put one more piece of that puzzle together come to church I mean who would not where would you like to have been last Sunday morning where would you have liked to have been last Sunday morning you think about it ball game Walmart Heavenly days I wouldn't even want to be at your house because I'd be alone I hope you were here but the assembling ourselves together listen there is no way that we can make it without each other not a one-man show we had one man Jesus Christ but you know what he did first you know what the first thing Jesus did he divided himself he divided himself I'm coming back in you and you and you and you and you I'm going to divide myself then we're going to fight the devil with everything we got for if we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there remains no more there is not a sacrifice for that there's a sacrifice for ignorance there's a sacrifice for sin there's a sacrifice for adultery come on somebody there's a sacrifice for all that but not that if you sin willfully after you've received the knowledge of the truth there is no sacrifice that can cover your sin man I'm just reading the Bible I'm not condemning anybody but if you don't listen to the word of God if you don't do what the word of God says you're condemning yourself already that's what the Bible says right now remember this here's the quote here we'll read this and then we'll stop musicians get ready to come up now remember this true church now look truth truth there's been bribes bride kind of all kind of Rights all kind of churches that's a quote from Brother brown right well he said they'll come one so Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how let that Antichrist Spirit would come into that church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his words the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church not bad it's not Pentecostal not methodists not brandonism we're the True Church of God the bride look and and what she stands for who she is I'm sorry true revelation of the true church and what she is she's the bride and what she stands for we stand for the word nothing else and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true Revelation how many times they gonna have to say true if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the message Church man and by God's spirit discern what is discernment dividing separating amen that's why the Bible says that in the congregation at the end time that a sinner won't be able to sit in the congregation the righteous why because there's a dividing time there's a time that you don't come in here because you won't there's there won't be anything in you to want to come here well praise God I mean that's what it is you don't have a want to inside of you you've sealed yourself away you've sealed your doom please don't do that keep yourself open for revelation and by God's spirit Discerning withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will then be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert what did he use Divine Healing discernment no he quoted the word Satan hates Revelation he hates for you to know more about God you know why because you'll know more about God than he does praise God but we love it and with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them that's where your standard will be raised up where's that standard it's inside your body that when that cortisol of sin is released there's something to suppress it it's the word of God then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be like ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five were wise five were foolish now that word wise means prudent mindful of one's interest they were mindful that they needed to hang on to that lamp and to make sure they got the Holy Ghost and that they trimmed their lamp because you get to all down here but you trim your lamp have you ever used one of those I know some of the kids will just look at you crop side but they call them hurricane lamps we still have them in case the power goes out if you live in guildsville Georgia you need something you know the power's gonna go out two or three times used to be a month now it's a year but hurricane lamps they're they're just they're so nice they'll like to place up Dad had to live under those kerosene lamps because they didn't have a power but when the power goes out guess what we don't have any either so you take that thing and right at the very end of that Wick if it's all black and gummed up yeah you'll get a fire but it'll be like and it'll get black all inside of your all inside of your little lamp thing your little glass thing but if you'll take that thing and run it up real quick trim that off roll it back down like that baby it'll give you the prettiest light it won't flicker it won't make that all Gummy up inside somebody getting what I'm saying thank you father of them were wise and five were foolish they wise was prudent mindful of one interest I want you to look at this word foolish that's where we get the word from Morris look what it means impious not showing respect or reverence you better reference every gift you better reverence have a gift that God give a person whether he'd be a little preacher or a big preacher a little Deacon or a big deacon if God's put you in that place you better show respect and reverence because touch's not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm not showing respect or reverence Godless they were virgins they were foolish they had lamps but they didn't get any oil they were Godless they were without the Holy Ghost because that's what all means the Holy Ghost right let's read this real quick musicians come on everybody's stand we'll get out of here it's 8 35. they were sitting here well praise God but don't tell me what to do don't tell me I got a River's headship no no I ain't doing it well guess what you're a foolish virgin took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps they took oil in their vessels and their lamps with their lamps while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept so they all did and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins listen all 10 got up hello all 10 woke up and all those versions are rose and trimmed their lamps but if you try to get these virtues without the Holy Ghost what brother Brown said a stumbling block power without character and the foolish said unto the wise at least they knew where to go to get it that's why they're going to come to you one day and say let me in that Ark and you're going to say man you've goofed around for 30 40 years you've had the same opportunity I've had you go get your own that sounds harsh but that's what the Bible says and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out in other words they had a little bit of the Holy Ghost on their spirit because if it had holy ghost in their soul they'd be born again but to add a little holy ghost on their spirit for our laps are gone out but the wise answer said not so you've been taught you've heard the message lest there be not enough for us and you in other words there's not enough time for us to go over all this again to get your lamps full but you go rather to them that sell and buy for yourself and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the what the door was shut afterwards came also the other virgin said Lord Lord open to us in other words they knew even where the Lord was and we were in there with him but the door was closed but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know there's that word again I have not had an intimate relationship with you even though you're a foolish virgin even though you're going to have a place in heaven you're not my bride you didn't do what I said you didn't get ready when I told you to get ready but I know you not watched therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour or in the son of man cometh talk about wisdom let me get right down here to the bottom and we'll close we'll read it later on but brother Brown says fourthly the next thing we're coming to which will be Sunday morning will be temperance okay Temperance at Temperance oh my we've come to Temperance now you've got faith first you have to have that to begin with then you add virtue of what strength to your faith hey fished a rock kind of virtue then you add knowledge if it's the right kind of knowledge which is what Holy Ghost knowledge now you're going to add Temperance Temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol no no Temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure not in this case this is Bible Temperance Holy Spirit temperance drinking and he said that's just one of the lusts of the flesh but we're talking about Holy Spirit Temperance that means how to control your tongue not be a toddler how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks across to you oh my boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started aren't we then we wonder why God is not in his church doing miracles that they used to do boy a lot of us is going to fall off before we get started now this is a prophet we like to quote them good quotes but what about these quotes aren't we then we wonder why God is not in his church doing Miracles and things that they

kindness for people that hate you what almighty God we serve somebody ought to put that on a t-shirt a big letter what a mighty God we serve you love the Lord Holy Ghost knowledge we got to have it to move up the pyramid we've got to have it to be good good Christians I mean Christians that God can use listen he's got many signs the Bible says many sons he's got many sons but there's going to be a certain group that's going to be an adopted set of sons that's going to be able to stand one day and thwart this toward Satan just like what brother man said when we what no know we know and have an intimate relationship with God we ought to try that sometime has ever let's sing the course again [Music] [Music] with me is [Music] [Music] has ever no no dear heavenly father Lord I pray that you'd
