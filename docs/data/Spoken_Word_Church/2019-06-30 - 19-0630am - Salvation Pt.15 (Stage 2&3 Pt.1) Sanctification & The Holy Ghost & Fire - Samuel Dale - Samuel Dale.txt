«  87       †          Now, the first step is "repentance towards God." And then follows after that, is water baptism, "water baptism," "Repent, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ." See, water baptism follows, showing that repentance was genuine. Or, to "remit" our past sins, that has nothing to do with future sin. It only remits. "Repent, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ." What for? "Remission." Taking away of past sin has nothing to do with the future. Just, your sin has been chopped off, what you did.
88    You can't repent for what Adam done. You never done it; Adam did. You just get forgiveness for what you done. The old nature is still there.

«  89       †          Let me take this board just a minute. [Brother Branham draws illustrations on the blackboard--Ed.] Now, here is a human heart. Now, I'm not... I'm a long ways from being an artist. Here is a human heart; and here is a human heart. Now, this one over here has a snake in it, that's sin, here he has his life. This one over here has a dove in it, which is the Holy Spirit, here he has a Life. Well, this one here, he has malice, hatred, envy; that's what's causing it, is this fellow here. Well, this one over here has love, and joy, and long-suffering; and That's what does it, down here.
90    Now, when you are asked, or you are forgiven of your sins, you've only done this, taken that away. But the thing that made you do it is still there. That's the old root of evil; it's still there. Notice, then you repent and are baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, that He forgave you of your sins. Notice.

«  91       †          Then, secondly, comes sanctification, which sets our mind in order for holiness, to think right. Taken away... sanctification is a compound Greek word, which m...

surely there is a vein for silver and a place for go where there is where they find it he set up an end to darkness and search with all out all perfection the stones of darkness and the shadow of death as for the earth out of it cometh bred and under it is tuned up and turned up as it were alive were fire I'm sorry there is a path which no foul knoweth in which the vultures I have not seen he put forth his band upon the rock he overcomes the mountains by the roots he binds the floods from overflowing and the thing that is he had been bringeth he forth to life man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it found in the land of the living it cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof the goal in the crystal can not equal yet in the exchange of it shall not be for the jewels of fine gold the topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be valued with pure gold seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living and kept close from the fowls of the air [Music] God understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place thereof to make me wait for the of the winds and his way of the waters by measure then did he see it and they declared it

amen I want to see him don't you good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to Ephesians truth where we've been reading and then we'll go back to Ezekiel 36 and did you see a body that our visitors I don't think they're visitors like they've been here before but meant to have you with us and just remember Terrence releasing them Britney their daughter-in-law her great grandmother passed away and they're having the funeral today so remember them to be traveling backwards and for wages preaching in Kentucky remember him remember the Bible

um any other announcements I'd really miss them that we will pick back up somewhere okay I just remember all these that are traveling there are many a way today or with their children and things going to youth camps and things so remember them and different things that they've gathered all over so just prep the Lord would bless give everybody a safe journey that's the main part father we thank you for this day and your grace we thank you for your love we thank you for your understanding and we pray that you would just be with us and God us keep us Lord because within thy hands we know that we're safe so you just got each one be with all those that are not here remember all the sick among us just reach down touch each one father because we all need you we're getting older and more worn out but that doesn't mean we stop that means we have to gear up and go on and just walk in you remember our wife Lord she's having a lot of trouble with her sinuses and things Lord and just be with her and take care of it have your way forgive our sins lead us by thy grace in Jesus name Amen okay visions 2 and verse 8 says for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God amen let's turn it over to Ezekiel 36 got remember what we're doing we've been the own salvation now for quite a while talking about it and that's what we're doing with you know there from Ephesians that you're being you're going through a journey your Christian journey doesn't just happen all at once and everything's done you're constantly going through a journey and when it's all to where no matter how much you've been in the journey it's still of being born again something taking place each day in our hearts and lives until we walk off of this earth then our salvation will be complete alright now let's read it from Ezekiel 36 start verse 24 now what take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land now this is this is a promise of a holy ghost land not just a form of returning Israel that's natural that that's natural right he is going to return him and he did return them to their land but now this is speaking further than just being you know that I'll gather you from the heathen and bring you back to your country see because watch then when I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you a new heart I'll throw what I give you in the new spirit when I put within you and I will take away this is the only heart out of your flesh now I'll give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them then goes right back to the land right and you sealed well in the land that I give you and all because of this what caused land remember you can't understand Redemption without looking at the world in the redemption plan of man is the same for the world and it is for mankind heart because the world see went through justification are the cleansing in the days of Noah the blood wrinkled opponent in the days of the Lord Jesus one day has to get a fire baptism that's the same thing as we're doing we're going through justification sanctification baptism with the Holy Ghost and see that's where here that Ezekiel is showing bringing the people back to a natural land I've been he's showing bringing them to a change of heart then he's showing them right back to the land coat it all covers and that father we thank you for your word and we ask you to just bless each one got us then Jesus name you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word as I said we've been studying for a while about the plan of salvation all right and we're talking about what is the plant what is the new birth okay now they asked the Prophet and we believe it asking said is ever born again believer have to have this three stages of grace he says yes so we're talking with someone this morning about it see and I've tried to explain that over and over you said well did Martin Luther have Martin Luther had to go through justification sanctification baptism when the holder goes to have the new birth you say well now the Prophet said it wasn't no no wait a minute there's a difference in the age that you're in and the individual the age was the age of justification right but the birth was the new birth which was justification sanctification baptismal or ghost or either your prophet missed it when he said everybody has to have the three processes all right so you see we're holding it correct so in John Wesley's day you had the second work of grace as we'd call it coming into view under sanctification but as far as John Wesley John Wesley had to have the new birth right so everybody has to have that new birth so never never forget that part if you don't understand that question me about it later - what we can understand the doing but I have to stay with what the Prophet is saying to the point that and to be able to for it to fit together that anyone who has the new birth has to go through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost because every baby's born the same way water blood life all right so then we keep it in to that point all right and what we've been trying to do is to show what happens in that new birth grant the disciples as we said they spent three and a half years in their journey before they receive the completion of their salvation and the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right that doesn't mean we have to go three and a half years no no that is it can be at one time if you believe it but it's according to how you can believe when the house of canoeists they believed it and that was it on the 3000 outside they believed it that was it but on the disciples it took three and I hear why because it was going to be written this is why keep emphasizing that point if you see what I'm getting at it would be written then in the book of Acts and the things and the Apostles and the writings in the Gospels to show what happens in our journey in life see they would be going through those three stages you know because they've repented of their sins and followed the Lord Jesus they were sanctified in st. John 17 all right but didn't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost until the day of Pentecost all right let's see it was put in here for you and me what if this had not been put in the world that's my whole point huh what has it not been not been put in the word what the Apostles went through for three and a half years you wouldn't have the four Gospels you wouldn't have the book of Acts and you wouldn't have any thing to tell you and be able to seal your your own salvation with the Word of God and to be able to say this is what the Bible says and so I believe it that way aren't you following me see I mean I've been much driving at these things to try to get that point to you to where we can see it all right now we took the little draw in the profit made on the message on the future home to try to show you know what happens in the new birth all right so let's pull that back up and just run a Feist quote through and get over to a point and then we don't want I have something I want to bring up on that so go ahead and brothers if you will and pull up the drawing yep there you go so we draw in the message called a future home he draw two hearts okay none of me I'm I'm sorry saying B I believe it's the same heart because of how he goes through to redemption all right now he didn't use that wording he draw two hearts he dropped one put a snake in it he put lines in it or something called it sin and then he draw one with a dove in it all right the first one represents us as we were natural born people everybody is born in sin they put in iniquity spouse from our mother's womb and a liar well not everybody doesn't matter who we are it's the same thing for all of us there's no shortcut cause you kinfolks we don't believe it nothing like that see the disciples some of them would have been hike brothers maybe to the Lord Jesus but that didn't shortcut it they had to go through the journey okay now what you see we took it to try to show that all born didn't sin okay here's your sin okay there's your snake that causes you to do it he says that snake in my heart we just read in the Bible and that was reason I emphasized it we just read in the Bible in Ezekiel then he's going to give him the land right the next verse he's dealing with the inward man to talk about taking away the stony heart then in a minute he's right back talking about the land when the Bible says in one of those this in there about the the sprinkle you honor is that the children is got got sprinkled maybe a Methodist might have that point you know that sprinkled but I still don't agree with but case you see then that's what it is over in the scriptures i believe it's ephesians what five where it talks about being washed by the water of the word now how are you washed by the water of the word I guess you need to get a bath No it's the opening of the word that washes us right it is the revealing of the word it is God revealing himself to us is what drives out that unclean spirit remember because it goes out of sanctification we'll see that's what I'm saying we we we take things and we will drift what does each one of that you know know the Bible is trying to show us like I said washed by the water of the word so we what we need to do now Wednesday night I want everybody to be here so we're gonna have a big tub up here and we're gonna give everybody a bath cuz that's washing you by the water of the word no that's silly that wouldn't save us that might make us cleaner but it wouldn't save us huh so what I want to wash by the water to work I want to know how this guy gets driven out he's driven out by the opening of the word or the revealing of the word and that comes about what Pryor's studying searching for God believing that drives that unclean out of us all right and we come to the point see that we that were clean so bring it up to the Word of clean and we'll shortcut the message part bring bring it up to the one where it's just what okay that's what you look like when you get through with justification and sanctification you're clean that's wonderful that's a great place to be we remember our message there the other day that's a dangerous stage because that unclean spirit jesus said went out of the man that snake and all that things went out through your repentance and you're following God and searching human salvation or but if you don't get something back there he's coming back and he's gonna be seven times worse right okay now so we got to deal with that part right there and I I emphasize it over and over and the last message now what would you that's you that's you that's your show it's called a heart by the Prophet because of Jesus saying as a man thinketh in his heart so is he all right the heart is the center of anything it doesn't mean this exact middle part its meaning the port calls his act to run or a peach you know a seed the seed can be over to the side you say well that's not a sitting on once that's the heart the heart is what makes you live is what you are and there's a man thinketh in his heart you don't think with your brain you say yeah I do no no you you try to it works to that part but the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so that heart is the soul of man which is what you are your soul is your being your soul is your being of what you are it's your person cuz you don't get a new heart now it's what we read in Ezekiel I'll give you a new heart I'll take away your stony heart boy he just took it all out left it empty now see that's that's what our human minds like to say what happened what was the zekiel describing I give you a new heart what was he describing you don't take your heart out put another heart in but it's not the heart you are a being which that means you're a soul because that was what happened in the garden when man was created God breathed into his nostrils and he became a living soul he doesn't say became a living heart though he became a living soul of being a person all right you see that that's what you are you're a soul that's you see we just use the word heart but the heart is the soul of anything or the the what causes you to be there's a real you that's why the Bible says the soul that sinneth doesn't say the spirit and or the body it says the soul that sinneth shall die see the soul is the real you so that's worth cites you remember I got them all laying here you've got some of them so you know where that they found within the heart of man a little compartment that there's no nothing in it or whatsoever and science says what we believed that would be the abode or the place of the soul to me that's just it expression it doesn't mean we got a little inch compartment no more than it means that you think it I'm I'm about ten messages ahead studying you know that brother branham describes when you're born again that that new birth coming into your soul is like a button like a little bitty button that's exactly what that statue of a perfect man is you borned again but that don't give you everything then we got a long ways to go okay I'm trying to speed up you think I'm trying to slow down you think I'm dragging my feet over and over I'm trying to get a point across lean get a point across to you then we move on to the next point all right do you see one gamma that's you that's you it's clean that's beautiful that's your soul you've repented you've accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior you've been baptized to prove that you're your repentance is correct and you're walking in the Lord and you go daily through a cleansing of repentance and seeking after God and being guided by his Spirit and then one day the Holy Ghost will come and fill us but you see we haven't been taught the truth of the new birth what does that mean it's wrong that we haven't been taught we haven't been taught we Baptists Methodists president but even the cat I mean even the Pentecostals that teach the justification same things baptism oh I wonder if they know what they're talking about so I believe in a definite experience of justification a day when you repented of your sins and God forgave you and done away with that sin I believe that but that day you didn't have to get the new words because there was still a lot of problems we went through who are the Prophet covered it future home even when your sins are chopped off he said that does nothing to the future of your sins he says the thing that calls you to do it it still dire but brother dad I went to the altar and I cried and I played prayed and I accepted Jesus Christ I'm not saying you didn't go all the way I'm not saying that way you you take those wordings and you cut me off because it's possible to do but it'd be a hard thing to do to go throughout at one time that's what I keep beating on you beating on you three and a half years for the Apostles to come to a place that they could receive the Holy Ghost you know why so that could be put in the Bible to show you and me what it would take for us to come to a new work alright do you follow me they were just because you're swept and clean what is that soul let you come to the altar you repent of your sins chopped off you pie sin then you ask God to sanctify you cleanse it wash by the water of the word since your side is the Lord Jesus and st. John 17 sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth those through the opening of the word the disciples were set aside that's the same thing to happen to you and me all right but that makes us clean that means that soul is pure has no sin because God has wiped it out okay but let's give an example you come to the outer you prayed for your repent of your sins you go through justification you can go through sanctification them to be you set aside okay that puts you in a good place right now suppose it's about a week two weeks three months two minutes they don't matter before the Holy Ghost comes in who are you what are you I can find you by putting the snake back in I hope you mean know what I mean by putting the snake back in I can find your old nature are you with me I can put the snake back and find the nature of you but remember now I've got these where the Prophet is describing it then when you're born into the world as a baby I tried to explain that the other day to me that looks like a newborn baby to me a newborn baby has no sin no problems no troubles two three four years five years it's still it's beginning to do little things and it's not exactly right but it's not if your age of accountability yet all right see it but it's being motivated by the people that are around it and that's why I get on to your parents remember them children want to walk like you talk like you and act like you right I guess the tickle with Thomas I look at him sometimes they go walking off and here goes Richard Richards got that certain walk and he bent over just to her and he's walking you know and your ghosts on us we look like each other right even though it's not even born in the same family you wind up looking like each other I can explain that but we don't want to get into that language listen that baby is clean and pure for a long time but then all at once it begins to start changing the little nature is being born into that baby that's exactly what you are is a nature or a being or a person that little soul that's in there that you receive when you're born into this world as it was with Adam you come over here and every baby's born God breathes into its nostrils it becomes a living soul not as eternal as Adam that ain't gonna leave that over there but remember you're still a living soul right now that little soul starts being motivated it begins to act like mom and daddy well I'm because it's being mostly a nature is being made you understand what I mean but so would it would be born into a what would you call it a baby it would be born into a neutral state would that be a good word for you know what I mean neutral in other words it doesn't have anything but like I always say you take that little baby that's born in the hospital room right that little baby is born in the hospital room what's the first thing it hears nurses over there this is the new this is the the full moon and we're gonna work all night long do not at blankety blankety blank all kind of words is coming out a poor little old baby ain't got a tow the my baby didn't your note bad words worthy to get it I mean you go to a little kid it's two three years old right and a little kid standing there with cooking his hand cookie all over his face and you say honey did you get that cookie no now where'd that come from well I come from marvel line about two cookies now just don't be silly I'm trying to preach but it is kind of like we were live in it chiropractor of the other states when he was explaining about I think it was his grandson anyhow every little child was but ever it was they was praying for the little two-year-old not two-year-old praying for him praying for that little two-year-olds been have some the problems you know he said no Lord said you let Johnny you know her what his name was ain't I don't know exactly what I always say it but anyhow he wound up being that they were praying for that little one to listen to mom and daddy you know well when they finished praying the little two-year-old said Lord would you help mom and daddy to understand me okay [Applause] pretty good maybe not all the whole story but pretty good point but what are we if the unclean spirits going out all the things what are you you're clean but that's that nature you're just too clean Erin Roberts with Erin Roberts has got a nature away a be it he used to call me up on the telephone you need to be talking away and I'd be setting up in the middle of the night listening to him talking all at once it gets kind of quiet he's going wake up you called me on the phone I answer the phone you don't answer you don't say who is this you know my voice one because there's word nature's and I get what I'm talking about every one of us has got a nature not talking about that unclean that's the devil that snake represents the devil that unclean spirit since the devil I'm talking about us being born as people as babies and it takes a while for that change to make a nature within you right seven eight years old maybe what's it what's the age of accountability no nobody knows is when you're accountable so then that would be the point that until that age run-run says nothing's recorded are you with me nothing's recorded to the little feller till the age of accountability but he's already got a nature since eight years old okay just to the more point he's already got a nature he already knows how to lights heat steal and do everything we had to walk to get some things yesterday down at the hunting limb and there was Thomas come along behind me was having to carry all this stuff I said Thomas why don't you take the keys and go get the truck I wouldn't dare let him do it but we're just laughing about it huh let's see let's get what I'm talking about what is that between the point of cleanse and set aside for service of sanctification and the indwelling of the Holy Ghost to come in and live what are you and what are you doing well kind of a nature to I'll that unclean spirit I'm not talking about that snake being you that's the devil that's his doings that's part of his nature come in and stealing unto us we're all born and set to a certain way and we all live our lives we all have different natures different ways you know our thinking is different you like this car I like that car you like this food I like that food they we're all different let's just call that a nature a way of being and seeing them from the time you get sanctified till the baptism when the Holy Ghost comes in what are you you're what you was today before you a sanctified call the sanctification done which took the snake out he didn't take you out it took the snake out the motivator goes out right you still you you mean you get sanctified and you're so clean and perfect no you're not that's not eternal life sanctification don't give you eternal life that's not it it just gets you sacked or God can come and live so your father won't say it now this is clean this is and that's wonderful but God wants to fill that but did you get to point let me ask you one more time cuz they don't matter to me if you don't like the way I preach that's that's your business I do the best I can to explain something 10 times over and I finally get it explained maybe I'm explaining it to myself well alright I don't worry about it see when sanctification comes it claims that that's a soul that's you that's a being it cleans is that the snake goes out but you're still the same person it didn't change your height your higher you color you you didn't get young when you got sanctified it just takes out the unclean spirit and every what time it takes from there 30 seconds or 30 years or whatever don't matter whatever it takes in that period of time you're you you're right where you was the day before tonight when out you just lost the motivator but you're still an unregenerate edemen being I'm trying my best to explain salvation through the Bible terminologies in the prophets way of expressing it so we can really see what it is to be born again when I just went up the holler it accepted Jesus Christ my Savior you can't tell me I saved I'll tell you one you think it won't wait a minute now we're just your mean-looking attitude come from when I get out my righteous indignation give her down my righteous indignation gets all stirred up and one brother said that and one night in the ministers ministers meeting he was having and one brother said to the other one said when I get stirred after my righteous indignation the other one said when I get stirred up I'm mad he was telling the truth all right we get what I'm talking about what are you gonna do with that person that person is in a horrible condition with a wonderful condition a horrible because we went through the whole time there's where the unclean spirit can come back and when an unclean spirit comes back he becomes a religious person you remember that the Prophet said it becomes a religious nature he said that's why you can't tell that woman it's wrong to cut her her wear shorts and pants sometimes because the devil is inside the anointing of the Holy Ghost is in the spirit on the second room the bodies just are again between it too one day it's motivated this way the next day motivated this kind of way right so what are you gonna do you understand what I'm talking about that's a child when it becomes to the age of accountability and that thing starts going back to what it was that snake is trying to come back in not a snake come back crawling within you come on my brother Dale preaches like he's a snake crawled in there no and I'm like this at least you ought to be able to explain to your children brother Dale ain't talking about a snake instead of said why don't you go ask him I don't know what he's talking about myself there's one of them momma's and daddies enterings of the demons okay here's what I don't understand you will then come to help me ask me about it I'll try my best to explain it to you mmm get what I'm talking about now get to the point where we can move on it's a wonderful place to be when the unclean spirit goes out which is a dangerous place called anointed ones can come right back in there and that devil can come right back into that soul and that spirit can be unknown anointed with the Holy Ghost and you can go out thinking you're Christian the disciples heal the sick cast out devils all kind of things you can do every bit of that and still be lost okay now so we got to do something there we've got to replace that old unclean spirit an old root of evil and to do that the only thing that I know we can do is just take the word cause but that time we should be clean enough to believe what God says we ought to be to the bases we said Lord I've done maybe I don't understand but I believe you I believe you're trying to get me straight and get me lined up you're trying to clean me up you're trying to get me repentant and keep me that to that stage all right cause see now we're gonna get to this later I'm not doing it today but I know where the point and click two minutes ago so I'm gonna click it back okay but I ran him on the future home he said cleanse and set aside but to Bible when it says it and brother I'm used it or you're what Holy Ghost and with fire but the Bible says Holy Ghost and with fire what does it say and with fire I thought the Holy Ghost was fire I thought it was a burner and brother branham future home have you been reading there's enough of us left right there even though it's proved beautiful and clean there's enough right tired of still the Holy Ghost can't come in unless it burns out the things of you that's the next message maybe this evening we'll see Holy Ghost and with fire that's not two different things that's one thing that's taking place the Holy Ghost is coming in as it is it's just burning out all that's left remember if it's burning out then there was parts left sanctification don't necessarily give you a total new nature it just starts working on your nature your ways your be you see if there's that's why we need the Word of God well I don't understand because all I know is I just accepted Jesus Christ as my savior and you've been telling me ever since then and I ain't saved I ain't said that a time I've tried my best to leave his places because brother Branham did here this message is so wonderful that prophet answers ever question if you will take his answer he'll talk about justification he'll talk about you repent of your sins and said sure if you die right there you're on your way to heaven well you've done his repented of your sins right he gives an altar call he says come down here and accept Jesus Christ as your Savior then he'll turn around say now go in that room over there on the other side where they're praying for the baptism when the Holy Ghost right what's so marvelous everything he said you can put it in perfect order it's like justification chopping off you pipes then go to the invisible Union and read it chopping off your pipes then the next stage it's as though you never done it I'm talking about him saying it and then in a minute he says a real unit and do it well I want that real me that's the guy I'm trying to find is the real me because I'm wanting the one where the dove is put in and I realized if the dove ain't put in I'm in bad shape cuz I'm a religious person Ryan Judas was very religious Balaam was very religious Balaam knew how to contact God but Ryan made a statement one day to mean it just they just went true like that and I think he said to be a prophet in Israel meant a great thing you realize you cannot show me but one time that Balaam was wrong come on let's take her Bible for talk about it tell me anything else Balaam was wrong on until he faced Elijah but when he faced Elijah he went wrong there's no record that Balaam was high hitting and missing or he was a prophet of God the Bible calls you see what we think we know all about all of these things and then I come up and I say well hey look what about this what about this what about these things here your sanctification cleanses and sets us aside having our hearts Hebrews 10 says having our hearts cleansed or sprinkle by the water of the word or by the word being washed by the water of the word you realize every time we come to church every time we pick up a Bible every time we pick up a tape every time we start meditating on God in the right way you realize that can be our washing that we need every move we make the Bible says pray without ceasing the Bible said watching pray I remember a man down at work he said now you know what that means watching pray I think I do you know we ought to be constantly pray and he said no say it means you keep one out white prayin okay shake you a little bit and get you away from the doles part that you're in now let's move on all right so we need to do something to this because do you realize even though you're clean even though you're sanctified even though you washed out you're still not right the Dove has not come in you know what brother Branham said about Judas he said is where only problem was he didn't make it to Pentecost right had Judas made it to Pentecost he'd have been right there within the south well now that got to be that's okay he did what he wanted but listen through the revealing of the word is what cleanses us our heart our soul in other words washing not by taking a bath but washing by the water of the word so you're born to get it faith now that's the new birth the washing of the water of the word is what carries us up the pyramid you see what took this message Peter him preached this Peter found him preached this statue of a perfect man but they had no way to express it enough to where that could be brought Paul never speaks of the stature of a perfect man he catch that point maybe I'm talking about good pop the disciples preached the statue of a perfect man all brought it in to adoption cause he moved up into a point the here comes brother branham trying to show us how to go to the change of a body if we don't get that weaning worried about our nature and our ways and if you ain't concerned enough to be worried about you do it just remember when you're talking about the heart of mankind you're talking about his soul it's not just a heart to see that's why the Prophet didn't say sin see though they got he said they say that it could be the occupancy of the soul he didn't say it wasn't so he just put it detect they're explaining there was something there that wasn't in the animal life and could it be the soul so the souls not an inch square that's my point all right I don't think the Prophet was describing how that that is one-inch square well that's bigger folks who's got a bigger heart that's bigger folks got a bigger so called we've got a bigger square spot that's silly see that's why say Aaron II Aaron sitting there good if I get to trade so God want to trade with him if it's the N Square compartment but that won't work all right are you listening he then when the Prophet is dealing with it he's dealing with the point of trying to show us who we are and what's going on let's deal with that person let's think about go ahead and pull up zekiel I see I think it's number 5 I'm gonna start with these because it mentions it twice three times in Ezekiel the way is in Ezekiel only not over 36 so to keep over this it's in that in Ezekiel 11 he must have understood some things look what he said and I'll give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you now I'll take away the stony heart out of your flesh and give them a heart of flesh now what's he talking about taking out a stony heart they'll run use the word crushed I like that one he said he crushed that old Tony are what does it mean now this is a point before we move in there I've taken out the stony heart would it not be what I was saying there I want to go that you take the snake out you take the sin out and you got the purity of the white heart so emblem standing there our heart becomes we called it hardened right you know we said well they've done hardened their heart they won't listen no that's terminology as we use and it's true in that doing but what is it saying see will use the disciples your stood Peter a stony heart but when God got through with him and I'm three-and-a-half here he'd really matter metella the old fellow died on that knee though he was still fiery end kind of do you understand what I'm talking about when you repent of your sins it's not your heart being hard and it becomes kind of mellow you know because that's your heart that's not that's the thumping gizzard that's your heart but something gives hurts not the soul the soul is who you are so God begins to work through us don't you remember that when you come to the altar and ask God to forgive you of your sins you started crying out to him you started going to church you started reading your Bible you started doing those things what had happened he bellowed your heart he took away the stony heart because the stony heart would be what was Cauldron to be stony would be the devil so he takes him out the unclean spirit there's a root of evil and now you're standing with a mellow heart not a different heart not a different soul not giving you another soul it's working on who you are and you're standing at the place that you can receive the new birth you understand that that it's not talking about taking away the stony heart he's talking about taking away the old you the old nature of you you ain't even dealing really with this unclean spirit other than that times got to go out to make it start where we can start being mellow you know what I'm talking about you remember before you become a Christian or is that you won't be honest see that's the problem I say something about somebody you know the first things I say I say you remember how you would and you sit there and say Oh maybe he's got a little discernment knows what I used to be I don't need discernment I am the discernment I'm here because I lived okay I lived I know what happened right when I joined the Baptist Church that's about all I done join the church not it took him about five years or six through the Baptist and to in this message to love me enough that he could give me the baptism when I old ago the last two years in this message before I'd ever received the baptism with the holy God and yet in that Baptist Church I was a deacon at 23 years of age teaching adult Sunday School classes you'd say well you know he was living a good life yeah and I believe God was doing that and I believe he was I believe I was justified and sanctified back there in that time of dealing with all of that I believe it because I know what happened you know it's like I told you before about it I was the type of person as a sinner not me I never was a fighter never was all kind of rowdy I was just you just didn't fool with me because that was the way I was I just didn't I just tell you don't leave me alone I wasn't argued to me if I wouldn't mean or fighting or anything like that but there was one thing that always bothered me it always bothered me that the Bible said if it's mighty on one's heat to turn the other one and I always said lord I don't know whether I got it or not because I was capable and they made this don't mean unto you but it isn't me I can understand in the old days the way they used to do you know you know how they used to do they get an argument they take gloves it's like the guy on slap him on the cheek no the Flavian they go shoot each other we said you may not be here I can understand that that was an insult you slapped him in the child it was an insult he had to answer you back I could follow that I always wondered could I live it one day at work this man was doing something he shouldn't have been doing pinching me in the wrong place they would always know what I'm talking about and I kept telling him I said leave me alone and he wouldn't do it I caught him sitting on the table and I intended to you set up on the table his legs hanging off I just walked up put my hands on his knees and I bounced on him if you don't hurt somebody that's a good way to do it just like anger knees then you'll bounce something they'll come up when he come up he come up and slapped me across the cheek boy he rung it good I just stood there and looked at I found out the end something went out I never said a word this didn't look daddy he got down off I tell you when he walked off he stayed away from me who about two hours no he's posted been working together it's homicide he went down the line he would I guess he's afraid what I'm gonna do finally he come back up apart apologize I said that's all right but I said told you not do what you're doing because you were he was painting in the wrong place and acted wrong you know what I found out at least I could stand that much of taste you ever thought like that no somebody ring myjob bless God I'll ring there's within the who we need to go back to the to the justification start over again though we ain't even got to that point I don't have to stand a big beating now but are you with me let's just read something better on them talk about and we go ahead to number four were brothers let's think about what he's saying so we've got to get that fool so it's gotta be brought full of the word let's listen to what he's saying and let him answer the questions and you'll see that he's talking about your soul and once you are what a wonderful thing it is to be it's off the message that North it not ok run it on up to paragraph 123 I'm back down excuse me pull back down a world make sure you understand because he was talking about the flesh he talking about the outside man the see taste feel feel smell in here ok you got it he's talking about that then he comes up watch him now inside of that as a spirit which you become when you're born in the earth now did we put the drawing up do we need that the white figure but sheet there that's what you are when you come in the earth the snake is what you are as you progress your life and I'm coming in and living on come on now look inside that is the spirit which you become when you're born in the earth you become a nature of being a person a spirit and the breath of life is breathed into him so God gives you the breath of life you don't give you the new birth he gives you the breath of life you are born a baby right with new with life then you start on that process then watch him of that nature cause look what he calls it that spirit is of a worldly nature now we're gonna get down to where the Bible said it'll give you a new heart and a new spirit and brother Brennan said that's where people missed it he said they think that new spirit is the holy spirit he said it's not he said that's the spirit given to you to live with he said cause you couldn't live with yourself okay that spirit is of a worldly nature now watch it more than brother anima so when he said something I read it and stepped back nothing god I wish I could be that way sometime but I don't want it all the time cuz it's too much with it I don't want what I got but look what he says because it was not given from God God can't give you the wrong nature now watch him he's just said he gives it to you but then he said it's not given this worldly nature is not given but it was given permitted by God your own nature in your ways was not given of God because God can't make you wrong how marvelous that prophet could bring it but God permits you to have a nature that you followed after you're dead and walk like him and act like him and and through your life and you become into that and you begin to act like people and do like people he permits you to do those things but he can't give it to you God can't give you something that ain't right so don't say Garten that's what my brother said he said God can't condemn me for being the way I am Methodist preacher with 12 years college he said he can't condemn me for being what I am he made me this way well what would you say I said brother he didn't make you what you are you made yourself what you are don't blame it on God it's your fault well he could kill me no yeah he could have kept us from he could have but he didn't choose to do that but look what he's saying now that spirit of a world in nature because it was not given from God than the word it didn't come from God for the wrong nature but it was given up permeated it was permitted in a clean nature that baby has nothing against it until it reaches the age of accountability your prophet said he said then God starts recording that's why babies go to heaven no matter what mama daddy is babies under the age of accountability go to heaven I love that can't blame the what else in know now you got that forever child that's born into the world is born in sin 17 iniquity come to the world speaking lives you live like everybody around it that right so that person inside there is a sinner to begin with well because it's not eternal it's only permitted so it can't be nothing now it's got five inlets he's getting to this second then five endless I don't know whether I can call the runoff first I know it's top concepts and love and so I was conscious love reason there is five inlets to the spirit you can think with your body go excuse me you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit don't tell your body you think with your spirit you can't have conscience in your body it just displays what you are well if it wasn't for this old body now Lord you made me this way thought my brother was saying he said he made my body to where it isn't he knows what it'll do nothing but he didn't make you that away you went wrong on your own okay what it has no mental faculties and it at all your body doesn't have any mental faculties you think you do you think you think we brought huh no there's something else with inside of you the Bible that's why it's so perfect then to say as a man thinketh in his heart his soul of the being of what he is but his spirit is what causes you to reason memory conscience and time but that's why did he'll get down here you know where we're getting to you get down out to the God can come on that so you have to think with your spirit you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being no reason doesn't see taste feel smell in here no I didn't tell where this is from this is one of the message and North it not 1965 8:15 or 816 what if you're sleeping you're out your body is lying there dead but your spirit can still reason there is five senses that control that inside man and then into the last man which is the soul there's only one sense that controls that that is free moral agency free will to choose or to reject no I love this one no no that ain't the ones gotta go I found one where he said Oh said we're not talking about evidences he said we're talking about products I said turn rejoice because that's they no other way of saying it better than that he's the wing talking about evidences you always talking about evidences right you're always talking about just evidence I know I'm a Christian could have done this I got this evidence he said we're talking about evidence we're talking about product now how much more could now people can live in this spirit they can dance in the spirit they shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit and they can absolutely have the real spirit of god anointed on that spirit and still be lost in just as devil possesses that can be brother branham are you against shouting you can take what he's saying a lot of times and really whack with it couldn't you are you against shouting no he says shout - are you getting speaking in - no I speak in tongues - murder Branham is trying to describe what we say that we do is it wrong to shout no we order shout the wrong speakin don't know we're speaking tongue wrong to cried pray and hollers worship God no we all do that so we were to be happy if y'all don't make your Christian walk along with our Christian cause the Prophet said we don't joke come on I'm quote you want a quote let's go Robert said don't be joking and he's the biggest joke there is right go brother Dalton they do sitting on the back of a truck and brother Brandon was joking yeah he told brother dolphin something said tell me a joke or maybe it was brother Puru green you said - tell me a joke he didn't have nothing wrong with joking but the wrong kind of joking right he wasn't against joking go - you joking aside he was against the wrong kind of joking he wasn't against having a new car come on folks I'm just mad enough I put it the way it is brother backing brother ran him in his early ministry didn't have a dime in his pocket right the one he started preaching the air a brand-new car yeah you going to talk to me got a brand that a brand-new car come on I'm not trying to throw anything I'm trying to tell it like this keep you even throw it you see you use those type of things against it no they don't do any good if you know the truth let the random always had a new car the Yeti was always poor it was making $100 a week but he traveled across the country where was he getting gas from cuz $100 a week was running was in the home don't you go back into the 50s hundred dollars a week was pretty good salary 55 56 hundred ordered a week to us was a good salary you know all come out of that fund then where the money was coming from right he said we put aside this come on I'm trying to tell you that we're not set on any kind of a thing that this that a debtor was set on what he says on his wording of what he's saying it'll straighten everything out it'll put everything into the correct order if we just get it to where we'll take what he says hmm what about it we'll pick this up this afternoon and go along with it let's just stop at that point they're anointed ones can be anointed on that spirit that inside man can be just as dark as gonna be now that's bad at it the editor truth so you built on emotionalism Amen for emotionalism I love it the dealer you can shouting and oh no it's like I've always said the Bible says I'll have to give an account if the gifts don't work in this church I'll have to answer but you know what you got the gift you're gonna answer it didn't you well we don't believe in gifts at Lulla where do you get that from I ain't never told him you might hurt somebody else said thought that's what they talk about then what I'm talking about I'm the one to ask me if you want to know what I did I'm a firm believer in speaking in tongues and shouting never never spoken telling in my life but I believe in it I believe it's a part of God I believe in an emotional ism I believe anything that's got Holy Ghost is going about some emotions but now let's lay it down look through everything that shouts don't mean this got it everything speaks in tongues don't mean it's got it am i quoting the prophet see what he said we put those things on the basis of because we do this or don't do that that we're saved that ain't it yeah but what evidence of whether you're saved or not that's whether spirit in you agrees with the word if it agrees with the word you start saying they something working right what brought you where you are brother Dale sucked and guided me the bases have believed in the word you remember my story wouldn't read them all told me if you believed in prophets and we talked I said brother mo you know how to tell me nothing about brother Branham please tell me what he taught I didn't re I love them things I love to hear about all of the things that read around them doing in and the testimonies I love all that but I know too that ain't gonna save me to read the Bible ain't gonna save me to hear the prophets not gonna save me for it to be revealed to me and salvation will go with it that's why the prophet they said what he said what is the New Bern's runaround he's just a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you all right there's the new birth well I never had no revelation brother well I'm sorry that goes that you get to a point to try to explain to them and they'll all come out and you you feel that well people thinks you're against the issuer against that I'm not against anything that's in the Word of God I always told you I believe the Bible I believe in a fivefold ministry to take this prophets message and break it down to us laity and I count myself as laity because I'm part of the body of Christ I believe in a fivefold ministry well but if some of you sisters has got some good revelation I'll listen to you and we'll make it a six fold ministry you know what I'm doing I'm not being wrong I'm telling you like it is I like brother wood we had a point he said an old Holy Ghost feel woman said self in that mountains if it serves God he said she'll help you if you'll listen talking about her brother the other day co musician next time my brother the other day and I said well they said he's why I've never believed the message I said you know why cause she's never heard if I call that name he'd just go haywire I said she never heard it because he never heard the truth right I don't blame her for not believing the message one because he never heard the truth exactly right not helpless that was to get to a place then we can believe God's Word and get settled into that of saying Lord show me if I need something show me what I need and hold my hand Lord let's not fail you understand we'll pick up this afternoon more longer the thought of what the Prophet was saying these that I'll give you a new heart okay I'll give you a new spirit he said that's still like right so then I put my spirit in you that's the Holy Spirit there's the new bar not a new heart called it can be cleaned and workable and work I'll give you a new spirit to live in to where you can get along with yourself he said but he said it ain't done until you get that God puts his spirit within you there's the Holy Spirit that's the new birth what do we got go ahead bruh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] every day [Music] father thank us all to the point that we believe you I'll make up to the vices that we can say thank you we just asked you to come up on our brother take away that thing called a kidney stone then a Python the crew get all out of the way we believe you we thank you like we plead the blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus I saw brother Harris one night when he had a kidney stone and he just broke out the sweat turn white but we prayed we prayed we prayed he cried it was all finished I said I only know one thing to do brother Harris but the board needs a touch I believe God is the only man I've saved it that one but now there's one thing that all of us can do together and you know what it is the Lord's Prayer we prayed to the Lord's Prayer and that stone he didn't leave him yet probably with the lighter yeah but that night it was like that it went down let's pray that if I miss the wording of it like I've always said I can't even pray the Lord's Prayer probably say it the right words God knows that well let's pray for brother Boyd that away you know what that gives contact about everybody in here unless - the Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in it give us this day then Lord our daily bread father sanctify us take away that problem for my brother we believe you here we feel your presence now you just go and manifest yourself turn brother we condemn that demon of a kidney stone in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this way you dismiss I am [Music]
