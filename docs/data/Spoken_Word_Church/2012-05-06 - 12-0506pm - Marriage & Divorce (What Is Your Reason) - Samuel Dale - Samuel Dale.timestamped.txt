[1:23] and prepare for this part of the wedding
[1:27] vows renewing remember now the
[1:28] announcements the fellowship meeting
[1:30] will be it for the pageants the third
[1:32] Saturday so remember to do to get
[1:35] everything ready for that but uh we had
[1:38] Robbie and Ruth has requested that they
[1:40] be able to renew their wedding vows and
[1:43] we we think it's a good thing because
[1:46] she Robbie had backlit and gone away and
[1:49] and things and been away from the Lord
[1:52] for quite a while but then he's come
[1:54] back
[1:59] this is their 20th
[2:02] wedding anniversary and I don't know
[2:04] whether it's the day or when it is or
[2:06] Wednesday Wednesday will be their 20th
[2:09] wedding anniversary so we appreciate
[2:12] that that's a good thing right so if
[2:15] they would come up we will go ahead
[2:16] through with the you know doing the
[2:19] wedding vows we won't have to do a whole
[2:22] lot we just want to do enough to uh to
[2:25] make it to where that they will be
[2:26] renewing their vows and the thing and if
[2:29] there's any other couple would like to
[2:30] come up and participate then we invite
[2:33] you to come and do so
[2:36] um because we just leave it open you
[2:38] know and that way we can do it okay I
[2:41] just like to read a scripture because we
[2:42] appreciate it
[2:44] desire and we always use this at a
[2:46] wedding so you know if you would let's
[2:49] just let me just read the scripture and
[2:51] then we'll say a few words and you know
[2:55] then we'll
[2:56] try to go through this part and get
[2:58] through with it all right you find in
[3:01] Genesis we always use this Genesis 2
[3:04] in verse 20 and Adam gave names to all
[3:06] the cattle into the fall of the iron
[3:08] Trevor Beast to the field but for Adam
[3:10] there was not found and helped me for
[3:12] him and remember it helped me not a mate
[3:14] right I have meat it's a different word
[3:17] Darcy
[3:18] anybody can be a mate when you take
[3:21] someone special to be part of you
[3:23] because that's what that word meek
[3:24] brings together see not m-e-a-t
[3:27] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[3:29] fall upon Adam and he slept and he took
[3:31] one of his ribs and closed up the Flesh
[3:33] and stood there up and the rib which the
[3:35] Lord God had taken from man made he a
[3:38] woman and brought her unto the man and
[3:40] Adam said this is now bone of my bones
[3:42] and Flesh of My Flesh
[3:44] she shall be called woman because she
[3:47] was taken out of man therefore shall a
[3:50] man leave his father and his mother and
[3:52] shall cleave unto his wife and they
[3:54] shall be one flesh we appreciate that
[3:58] because that's that's what it is and we
[4:00] come to a point of you know to renew
[4:03] their wedding vows so that's a good
[4:05] thing
[4:06] so you know we could have the kids lined
[4:09] up around all of them and make it look
[4:11] good to the world to see them renewing
[4:13] their vows but
[4:14] we really appreciate people being
[4:16] concerned that's right I think it's a
[4:18] good thing to do uh you know to review
[4:21] your vows to to tell one another that
[4:23] you love one another you know
[4:25] on that point you know and all the words
[4:27] should be doing it and that would be
[4:29] great to do okay but let's just do it
[4:32] this way Robbie
[4:34] 20 years
[4:37] you know and a time to think over a lot
[4:40] of things like come on are you go that's
[4:43] it
[4:44] after 20 years you don't have time to
[4:46] bring it over would you marry her the
[4:48] second time
[4:49] yes I would okay that's a good way of
[4:52] putting it on this you know this is not
[4:54] a total wedding of what you call the
[4:56] second time you know but it is a
[4:58] renewing all right that's right let's
[5:00] wait just a minute till the rest gets up
[5:02] here and it'll get the family standing
[5:03] around and that's good okay
[5:09] Robbie do you take this Ruth to be your
[5:11] awfully wedded wife I do
[5:13] Ruth after 20 years
[5:16] do you still love rock
[5:19] um you see to love each other in the
[5:21] Lord then it comes out to be a lot of
[5:23] things don't it so Bruce will you take
[5:25] this Romney to be here awfully with a
[5:27] husband
[5:28] amen so with the power invested in me as
[5:31] the minister of the gospel and not sure
[5:33] the state of Georgia I pronounce you man
[5:36] and wife
[5:37] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:39] amen but God has joined together let not
[5:42] a man try in any way to put it to
[5:43] something okay now you may kiss your
[5:45] brine
[5:51] thank you
[5:53] I'm ready to say but in the 90 days
[5:57] we'll say well you know when I don't
[5:59] know we'll say well we was there amen we
[6:01] was there we were standing there with
[6:04] Mom and Daddy when they was doing
[6:06] renewing their biops and I do I think
[6:08] it's a good thing to do and and all to
[6:12] to tell each other that you love each
[6:14] other and to renew the vowels and the
[6:17] things like that you know and you know I
[6:19] gave a quote there the other day what
[6:20] wrote around and was talking about
[6:22] that you wouldn't marry it in a church
[6:24] you know and uh he said that's all right
[6:27] said you're married they said it ought
[6:29] to be done in a church it should be that
[6:31] way and things like that well see my
[6:33] wife and I wasn't we you know we
[6:35] wouldn't uh she was a good dad just and
[6:38] I was just me and um you know we we just
[6:42] went down to a justice of the peace and
[6:44] her father was with us and and
[6:46] everything to stand there and and do the
[6:49] wedding but you know we're just as
[6:50] married as anybody else has ever been
[6:51] and you know we really haven't went two
[6:54] hours well then you remember back when
[6:55] on 50th with the 50th wedding
[6:58] anniversary we had an opportunity to
[7:01] have our vows renewed and that was good
[7:04] I I thank God for that don't you amen
[7:07] and encourage these to to you know love
[7:10] one another and that's the one thing my
[7:13] brother had a good point that he went to
[7:16] get he was going to get married and they
[7:18] went to this old preacher over here in
[7:20] the country and he thought man that guy
[7:22] don't know nothing you know come out our
[7:24] old overalls on Old Farm or something
[7:26] you know he walked out there and it was
[7:28] getting married you know
[7:30] he's thought man this is something man
[7:32] some old coocher like that doing my
[7:34] wedding you know and he said the old man
[7:36] told and said no Marshall should you
[7:38] remember now I said
[7:40] if you're on one side of the house and
[7:41] you watch on the other side of the house
[7:43] and said you got a rope run across said
[7:45] you just zigzag it said you're not gonna
[7:47] get nowhere
[7:48] said but now Marshall what you do said
[7:50] you just lay down your end of the Rope
[7:52] go around and take a hold of her hand
[7:54] with that rope in her hand and said you
[7:56] know that rope will just fall off the
[7:57] house he said I left
[8:00] thinking that guy had some good scenes
[8:02] yeah you know he knew how it was all
[8:04] about he knew life today amen so we
[8:07] appreciate that man let's stand back up
[8:09] together if you're willing to go to
[8:10] Matthew as we're in our scriptures and
[8:13] and reading in this little Book of
[8:16] Matthew 19. laughs
[8:20] the only father we thank you Lord Jesus
[8:23] for this day and this opportunity thank
[8:25] you Father for the ability to be able to
[8:27] stand here today and renew wedding vows
[8:30] see a couple that wants to live for
[8:32] these especially in order to see them as
[8:35] they've come to you here and they've
[8:37] been with us now for many many years but
[8:40] now coming to serve you and that makes a
[8:43] that makes a family of Art and we ask
[8:45] you to just bless them and be with them
[8:48] and take care of them bless us now as we
[8:49] try to minister your word and just have
[8:52] your way in your loving grace in Jesus
[8:54] name amen amen Matthew 19 verse 3. the
[9:00] Pharisees also came into him tempting
[9:02] him and saying unto him is it lawful for
[9:04] a man to put away his wife forever cause
[9:07] and he actually didn't send them to them
[9:09] have you not read that he which made
[9:11] them at the beginning made them male and
[9:13] female
[9:14] and said for this call shall a man leave
[9:16] father and mother and she'll cleave to
[9:18] his wife and they claim she'll be one
[9:20] flesh before there are no more Twain but
[9:22] one flesh but therefore God hath joined
[9:26] together let not man put us under
[9:29] they say unto him why did Moses didn't
[9:31] command to give her writing a
[9:32] divorcement and put her away
[9:34] he saith unto them Moses because of the
[9:37] hardness of your heart suffered you to
[9:38] put away your wives but from the
[9:40] beginning it wasn't so it was not true
[9:42] and I say unto you whosoever shall put
[9:44] away his wife accept it be for
[9:47] fornication and shall marry another
[9:48] committee to the adultery and who shall
[9:50] marry her which is put away does commit
[9:53] adultery you may be seated the Lord had
[9:55] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[9:59] now
[10:01] this is Messi's number eight as I said
[10:03] we'll try to uh we want to take them
[10:07] maybe at least another service or
[10:09] something on it but we'll try this
[10:11] coming Wednesday night to take questions
[10:12] and answers so if you're not going to be
[10:15] here to turn in your questions uh you
[10:19] know do it now and let me know or call
[10:22] me or whatever and we'll try to cover as
[10:25] I said give examples if you want to what
[10:27] about you know what about this what for
[10:31] that give examples and that's fine and
[10:33] that way we can can all come together
[10:35] and and talk about these things I am not
[10:39] your final Authority
[10:41] God is your final Authority so you must
[10:44] answer him for all things as I was
[10:47] saying this morning that
[10:49] um even in the the message that I co
[10:53] kept telling you this is the way I
[10:55] believe which means that
[10:58] um you know and that's the argument that
[11:00] was made for many years you could put
[11:02] away your wife fornication and that was
[11:05] before marriage but after you got
[11:06] married some said you couldn't put her
[11:08] away at all you had to live with her you
[11:10] know as she desired and uh then the
[11:14] others would say well you could put her
[11:15] away but none of them would allow the
[11:18] remarriage after then you know and uh I
[11:22] seek fornication as being one I believe
[11:25] the prophet expressed it to be
[11:27] that fornication and adultery is this
[11:30] same wording and the fornication
[11:33] technically is a girl that you know
[11:35] before she's married yes we understand
[11:37] an adultery is a technical point of
[11:40] being that of a woman that is married
[11:42] but then brother Branham would cover
[11:44] about Adam and Eve as we gave this
[11:47] morning that
[11:49] um she committed adultery
[11:51] all right because they were married and
[11:53] that's what I've emphasized over and
[11:55] over to you that when what is a wedding
[11:58] what is a marriage
[12:00] when the when your boy asked a girl
[12:03] and she accepts that's a marriage
[12:06] all right you break that
[12:09] and go off and marry somebody else
[12:10] you're living an adultery because you've
[12:13] done wrong all right what is a divorce
[12:16] to just take away those finals
[12:19] as I said what country would be in maybe
[12:21] it would have the rules like we have
[12:23] other countries maybe don't have them so
[12:24] you could go before the the king of the
[12:27] tribe or whatever he'd be you know hit
[12:29] man and he'd say well you know you say
[12:31] well this this and then well cast done
[12:33] and you know what they would stick by
[12:34] theirs probably more than what you would
[12:37] get us here to stick by them in America
[12:39] with all the paperwork that's fine you
[12:42] know because it would you know because
[12:44] they honor those things all right but
[12:46] trying to get down to that
[12:48] we know for a certainty that the woman
[12:51] cannot divorce the husband and remarry
[12:54] her husband must be dead Romans 7 we
[12:58] gave where the Prophet said it and we
[13:00] may complete this you know just call him
[13:02] back over to make sure that you
[13:05] understand
[13:06] but
[13:08] the point I wanted to try to get across
[13:10] this morning
[13:12] is one thing
[13:15] see if a woman if a woman we gave the
[13:18] prophet's words the word that a man
[13:20] could put away his wife for committing
[13:22] fornication and marry again all right I
[13:25] think he's free
[13:27] because now here's where you're going to
[13:29] get technical with me
[13:30] it'd be all right except the preacher
[13:32] well now you've got a problem with her
[13:34] because you cannot Rectify all of the
[13:38] quotes together if you take that line of
[13:41] the preacher can't preach because he's
[13:43] got two wives now I'm going with you on
[13:45] one basis if he's got two wives he can't
[13:48] preach right
[13:49] right but if that wife in that situation
[13:53] is taking care of its own self then he's
[13:55] free to marry again and if he's free to
[13:58] marry again then he would be free from
[14:00] the situation and there'll be no problem
[14:02] for him preaching
[14:04] and that's what I tell you I believe
[14:05] that that's the way I believe it so you
[14:07] can go with what you want to but now not
[14:09] for just any kind of demons and that's
[14:11] what we went through if you cause her
[14:15] right if you divorce a woman for any
[14:16] other reason then the the things we gave
[14:20] this morning of a fornication are an
[14:22] adulterous Safari
[14:24] then you wouldn't be free to marry again
[14:27] that's right
[14:28] and you if she married she's going to
[14:30] cause her so you're guilty of causing
[14:33] her trolls
[14:35] so what do you what people wanting to
[14:37] deal with you know they're not listening
[14:39] to the word and reading the word to
[14:42] express the full understanding of what
[14:45] the word says you know how much more
[14:48] guilty would you be for causing somebody
[14:50] to do something right
[14:52] are going doing it yourself right amen
[14:55] come on what would be what's what's much
[14:57] difference in it you you know like I
[14:59] said you could say well okay I got a
[15:01] living husband so I just shoot him man I
[15:03] don't live in Hollywood but I get
[15:04] married but you're a murderer
[15:06] what has that justified anything or
[15:09] what's it done you're guilty see so then
[15:13] keep those things in mind of what I
[15:14] tried to cover this morning see if a man
[15:17] has an illegal right to put away his
[15:18] wife she goes and does something wrong
[15:20] he's not guilty
[15:22] does everybody understand that I
[15:24] understand what I'm saying she's he's
[15:26] not guilty of what because she done it
[15:28] herself she was the one that brought it
[15:30] on all right but he causes her to do
[15:34] that even though you know there may be
[15:37] some problems but he causes her to do
[15:39] then he's guilty of causing her to
[15:41] commit adultery all right now that's
[15:44] what the Bible says and that's what we
[15:46] ought to believe in and try to walk into
[15:48] the light of that other because I mean
[15:50] the truth of it all right we have a
[15:52] scriptural reason
[15:54] then you're not guilty all right now if
[15:57] you say well now I don't know about the
[15:59] marriage well Jesus put away the
[16:01] lutherans and married to methodists
[16:08] see if you hold your line too tight you
[16:10] got it set on one thing
[16:12] one thing Jesus would not be able to
[16:13] marry the Methodist after putting away
[16:15] the Lutheran
[16:17] you understand
[16:20] the uh I'm your pastor and by being that
[16:24] you know if you don't agree with what
[16:26] I'm saying you know that's that's your
[16:29] problem and your situation I tried to
[16:31] make it as long as I could plain is a
[16:34] good to explain everything right because
[16:36] you know you have no reason to divorce a
[16:40] woman a man doesn't except it be for
[16:42] fornication
[16:45] all right then I added for it to be in
[16:48] that fornication be an adultery after
[16:50] marriage
[16:52] and that was I kept telling you this is
[16:54] my opinion because there is not a quote
[16:56] anywhere
[16:57] I've been over 40 something years and
[16:59] not a quote that brother Brown said that
[17:02] a man could put away his wife for
[17:04] committing adultery after they're
[17:06] married and then go on and marry
[17:08] somebody else there's not a quote for
[17:10] that so you say well you're out of the
[17:12] message well okay
[17:14] I could say some things back and say
[17:16] when did you ever get into it but
[17:19] there's no argument you know of of
[17:21] fussing about it I'm just going to tell
[17:24] you what I believe
[17:25] amen and then leave it from that you
[17:28] know to where it is it's left in in
[17:31] anybody else out there listening you're
[17:33] responsible of your people right
[17:35] it's not that I'm not Pastor nobody
[17:37] around the world
[17:38] don't call me and ask you your questions
[17:40] I don't do it but I'm not I'm pastoring
[17:43] here right I answer questions that are
[17:45] here you know and not not anything else
[17:48] all right so if it's the word saving and
[17:50] the word accept is the same word from
[17:52] Matthew 5 32 using the word saving for
[17:55] the cause of fornication Matthew 19 9
[17:57] saying except means that there is no
[18:00] other reason
[18:01] than the fact of what it says that are
[18:03] for committing fornication right all
[18:05] right then that wouldn't give you you
[18:07] couldn't argue there's no need of coming
[18:09] to me in Oregon all right now we gave
[18:12] you this morning off of conduct order
[18:15] and Doctrine in 1959 paragraph 187
[18:19] that
[18:20] if a woman marries a man and does not
[18:23] tell him that where she has been wrong
[18:26] in her past
[18:28] before they're married that he has a
[18:30] right to put her away and marry again
[18:32] and on that quote not around and said
[18:34] they were never married in the beginning
[18:36] because they was a false pretense she
[18:40] lied to him see and then he can put her
[18:42] away and marry again now he didn't say
[18:45] the preacher can't do that
[18:47] see that's where people says the
[18:49] preacher can't the point the preacher
[18:51] came is what everybody's supposed to be
[18:52] now preachers supposed to marry a virgin
[18:55] right everybody's supposed to marry
[18:57] birds
[18:58] all right
[19:00] but now that's what we can get into and
[19:02] we've been through it if a woman has
[19:04] been true and married a man and live
[19:06] within 50 years and she was a virgin
[19:08] when she started and they lived 50 years
[19:11] and she he passed it on she can marry
[19:13] again because she in God's eyes still
[19:15] virgin
[19:18] you see that's that's where that we we
[19:21] have to keep everything running in the
[19:22] correct order all right so we gave also
[19:25] from the paragraph 85 invisible Union
[19:27] where wrote around said that they could
[19:29] be married as much as even 10 years and
[19:32] come up and tell it and said then would
[19:35] have a demand would have a legal right
[19:36] to put her away and to marry again and
[19:41] because fornication is what
[19:43] unclean living right
[19:46] unclean living all right now I'll give
[19:49] you this one so let's pull up number 1A
[19:52] I was the notes and we'll start I quoted
[19:54] this this morning and I went back and
[19:56] found it to where we could have it so I
[19:58] want to read it to you I'm going to
[19:59] flashy red lights of this coming
[20:02] 1963 6 23 in the evening now look in in
[20:05] June to sell it chapter again Sodom and
[20:07] gomar on my what an awful thing
[20:10] unmarried to women going after strange
[20:14] flesh a man that's married to his wife
[20:18] they're not no longer to their one and a
[20:22] man now this that'll run out after
[20:24] another woman he automatically separates
[20:27] himself from his wife
[20:29] now that's as much to the man right
[20:31] right all right now watch and a woman
[20:33] that runs out with another man
[20:36] she is dead to her husband
[20:41] watched it she's denied her own flesh
[20:45] she's cut away from him that's right in
[20:47] the day of judgment we'll have to answer
[20:49] for it
[20:50] all right so that's if you want the
[20:52] scripture for it that's in Timothy uh
[20:57] First Timothy 5 and 6 where it says that
[20:59] she's dead boss 11. oh no
[21:02] so then that that puts that part to
[21:05] where we're going to be so now what we
[21:07] want to do this afternoon is cover
[21:08] something else that does sound like
[21:12] as I said there's no cause for
[21:14] divorcement except fornication all right
[21:17] and I want you to remember that's what
[21:19] I'm saying and that's what I believe
[21:22] well then they were saying to Jesus you
[21:25] know it's for any cause
[21:27] and he said it was himself in the
[21:29] beginning in other words he's saying
[21:30] you're not right it wasn't so from the
[21:32] beginning and you know all right then
[21:35] when it come to brother Brown and
[21:37] brought around and said that a man could
[21:38] put away his wife for cutting iron
[21:40] that's right
[21:43] but I've got two quotes where he says it
[21:45] that
[21:47] he cannot marry again just because he's
[21:49] cut her cutting her heart all right so
[21:52] we'll get that out of the way in a
[21:53] minute to start with but I want to get
[21:54] this out of the way and get it plain to
[21:56] you where you'll know what I'm talking
[21:58] about
[21:59] then sisters you should realize the
[22:02] seriousness
[22:04] of your hair
[22:05] amen
[22:07] that is the one specific thing that the
[22:10] Bible approaches
[22:12] about a a woman
[22:15] it sure covers clothes you know address
[22:17] modest to do this that and the other but
[22:19] it really lays upon you cutting your
[22:23] hair
[22:24] all right
[22:26] now
[22:27] I didn't realize the seriousness of that
[22:30] that much until I began studying on this
[22:34] so I want you to see that it would have
[22:37] to be the correct grounds
[22:39] so the prophet in saying that you could
[22:42] put away your wife for cutting her hair
[22:46] that would have to be the same grounds
[22:49] or the same situation as in Matthew 19-9
[22:53] right or Mark Matthew 5 32 it would be
[22:58] the saving or accept right
[23:00] complete so then we're going to see that
[23:03] for her cutting her hair
[23:05] brings her into a situation
[23:08] of fornication
[23:11] which would not be sexual intercourse
[23:15] I mean
[23:17] but would wind up to be unclean living
[23:22] right now I want your sisters to think
[23:24] seriously about this point
[23:26] and sometimes I know sisters ain't got a
[23:28] bad little habit of reason around and
[23:30] sniffing just a little bit and cutting a
[23:33] little here or
[23:34] Maybe
[23:36] burn off a little dire or something to
[23:39] to try to get everything to working
[23:42] but you're not do that and you ought to
[23:44] realize they're serious
[23:47] of what it means amen
[23:49] you said well brother Dale
[23:51] it don't mean I'm a fornicator well now
[23:53] you're gonna let we're gonna let brother
[23:54] random answer today right amen because
[23:57] that's the seriousness of the matter
[24:00] well that ain't gonna send me the hell
[24:01] cause I cut this little off the ends now
[24:03] now let me say it this way
[24:05] the cutting off the end wouldn't send
[24:08] you to hell
[24:11] I think you think
[24:13] the attitude of thinking you can do it
[24:17] and it'd be no problem which sends you
[24:19] to hell
[24:21] do you understand
[24:23] you understand my statement
[24:26] the thing you've done wouldn't be so bad
[24:29] if the thing that's causing you to do it
[24:31] right
[24:33] when I want to do this I want to do that
[24:35] I want to be and then women will use the
[24:38] excuse
[24:40] I want to be for my husband well that's
[24:43] good
[24:44] it's wonderful
[24:47] but no
[24:49] let's we'll just read some quotes
[24:53] and we're your prophet and how strong he
[24:55] makes it
[24:56] and you'll see why that he spent so much
[24:59] time about a woman cutting her right and
[25:01] I remember to just snip a little is
[25:03] cutting
[25:04] right that's right
[25:06] you know now in the Bible we won't go
[25:09] back and cover it everybody is in yours
[25:11] adults has fallen to message quite a
[25:12] while if you need it we will be glad to
[25:14] go in it in the Old Testament brother
[25:16] Brown said If a woman cut her higher
[25:20] you know for any reason he said now if
[25:22] something goes wrong and she had
[25:24] something had to be cut
[25:26] all right you know a reason
[25:28] maybe it was burned off for a little or
[25:31] maybe you know just anything that
[25:32] happened an accident
[25:34] there he said to shave your head yep
[25:39] and they took her down to the priest
[25:42] and shaved her head
[25:45] and let it grow back out
[25:48] now that was the law
[25:50] we're not exactly like that okay you
[25:53] think we don't have Grace and don't
[25:54] understand but if it was an accident
[25:57] happening and I went in the hospital
[25:59] room and there's half your heart on the
[26:01] savored clean off
[26:02] and you tell brother Dale I don't want
[26:04] to cut my hair I said well we're going
[26:07] to have a problem so
[26:08] you'd say would would you say it would
[26:10] be okay to fix it up with the rest of it
[26:12] yeah because of me that's me okay
[26:15] but if you ask me what the law says I'll
[26:17] tell you what it says right
[26:19] law said shaved it that's right
[26:23] you think that brother devil doesn't
[26:25] have Grace you have a lot more do you
[26:27] think
[26:28] and you think I looked at I told him
[26:30] last night the sister looked at me and
[26:31] she'd never thought that I said I'm a
[26:33] bigger legalist more of a legalist than
[26:35] anybody in this building
[26:37] right I have my own thoughts
[26:41] but if they're just my thoughts I don't
[26:43] bring them out of this Pulpit right
[26:47] I don't deal with my thoughts
[26:51] yeah I could be more legalistic than
[26:53] what you think
[26:54] but I just don't bring it out to try to
[26:56] beat people to death with it
[26:59] now I see something come in that's the
[27:00] way preachers are you know they're
[27:02] reading their texts and it's going to be
[27:04] on the mark of the beast look up now
[27:06] comes a woman then her dress is a little
[27:09] short the message changes and it goes to
[27:11] the dress now you know well I was led to
[27:14] do that now okay
[27:17] all right
[27:19] I'm not your God
[27:23] but most people are led by their
[27:24] eyeballs
[27:28] my brother told one time I'll call his
[27:30] name but he called and he was sitting on
[27:33] the platform in this preacher this is
[27:35] back in there right before they were
[27:37] coming in the message and the preacher
[27:39] walks around and looks and boy he
[27:40] changed his topic these people get on
[27:43] the platform of these two-tone shoes on
[27:45] is he looked up down the aisle and he
[27:48] looked around he was the only one that
[27:49] had on two-tone shoes I told myself to
[27:51] pull mine off and put them in my pocket
[27:53] you know where he could go on with a
[27:56] sermon but
[27:57] okay get that out of the way but now so
[28:02] I want you to understand what I'm saying
[28:05] we're proven this afternoon
[28:08] that for you sisters to trim your hair
[28:10] cut your hair
[28:13] is a sign of fornication
[28:16] which is unclean living not sexual
[28:19] intercourse
[28:21] I mean
[28:24] but
[28:27] how close it's gonna get
[28:30] it that's right
[28:32] my brother around and says she loves
[28:34] somebody else
[28:37] that's a quote we'll read that in a
[28:39] minute that's right
[28:43] he said I'm doing it for my husband
[28:46] I got into it you're a while back trying
[28:48] to explain about things and I always do
[28:52] simple terminology and I was plainly
[28:54] talking to you about the two sisters
[28:56] dress up to go to town but you don't
[28:58] dress up for your husband right
[29:00] I got into trouble with that that's all
[29:02] right
[29:02] all right I stay in trouble with things
[29:04] trying to explain but I'm still right on
[29:06] it
[29:09] why don't you dress up for your husband
[29:11] sometimes like you dress up no time
[29:14] and I thank you all to dress up to go to
[29:16] town that was what I was trying to
[29:17] explain
[29:19] but I misunderstood
[29:23] and then most would say well I don't
[29:24] even know what you're talking about well
[29:25] maybe you don't maybe I don't either
[29:27] but that's mean
[29:29] I think we were to be Christians but I
[29:31] think you're your husband is your
[29:33] husband right he's the closest thing to
[29:36] God you got right
[29:37] and without him
[29:41] or your father
[29:44] you have no history
[29:47] that's why in deuteron are in numbers
[29:50] where which one we've covered in the
[29:51] vows one day a divorced woman has no
[29:54] headship to deny her vows right
[29:56] so they're all counted I gave you that
[29:58] right
[30:00] all right
[30:01] it's a great thing to have a head now
[30:03] like I was saying this morning about the
[30:05] Spanish Hispanic the words from the
[30:07] times
[30:08] here's what it is you sisters you you
[30:11] bless God I won't I want my own thing
[30:16] you ain't gonna tell me what I'm gonna
[30:18] do well then that's right you're not
[30:20] going to tell me what to do that's right
[30:23] but you let it turn around and then
[30:27] you know they get in trouble and then
[30:29] they say my husband will take care of
[30:31] that
[30:35] a quote from Brother Brown
[30:38] that he said if his daughter was dressed
[30:40] wrong
[30:41] he didn't know whether he'd defend her
[30:43] or not
[30:45] would you like that quote
[30:51] see we don't quote at all
[30:54] we quote what we want
[30:57] all right go now
[30:59] be red faces and everything in the world
[31:01] and upset with me without any questions
[31:03] but I'll be glad to cover it but I'm
[31:05] just going to cover the same thing I'm
[31:06] going to cover it over to Wednesday I'll
[31:08] tell you this what do you mean brother
[31:09] Dale that's what I mean
[31:12] the word fornication has to go on into
[31:15] the situation of even eating food and
[31:17] offered to Idols right
[31:21] right right
[31:23] and that fornicator
[31:26] to call him
[31:28] the different things see
[31:30] all right so let's get into it now let's
[31:32] read it but I'm going to read the first
[31:33] two to make sure that somebody out there
[31:36] won't hear it and think I'm saying wrong
[31:37] and then we're going to go through the
[31:38] message
[31:39] all right so let's go with number one
[31:42] now of the message
[31:45] this is in Demon Ali religious realm
[31:48] 1953-609 a paragraph 225.
[31:52] and he's talking about how the women do
[31:54] with their little bitty heart cut like a
[31:55] man posed up you know the Bible says
[31:57] which is a disgrace now what and a woman
[32:01] the Bible claims if a woman cuts her
[32:04] heart
[32:05] a man's got a right to put her way in
[32:07] divorcement
[32:08] listen because she's not honest with him
[32:14] now come on read these yourself when
[32:16] you're thinking I was just blabbering a
[32:18] moment ago to say that it would turn out
[32:20] to be fornication and be some problems
[32:22] with it for your sister to just trim a
[32:24] little and just cut a little and just
[32:26] you know huh
[32:29] he said because she's not honest with it
[32:31] listen we have to get down and preach
[32:34] the Bible here some of these days said
[32:37] if she bogs her hair she dishonors her
[32:40] husband
[32:41] if she's dishonorable she ought to be
[32:43] put away
[32:45] you can't marry another one
[32:49] now that's to the man right but you can
[32:52] put her away boy that's going hard and I
[32:56] can feel it but that's the truth
[32:59] that woman can be put away
[33:01] for cutting her heart
[33:03] but the man can't remarry just because
[33:06] of that ground that's right all right
[33:09] so now if there is no reason as we
[33:11] covered this morning except it be for
[33:13] fornication
[33:18] all right so cutting your highest
[33:20] fornication right
[33:24] now you understand the word I'm standing
[33:25] I've got to make that blunt that's right
[33:28] this fornication for you to cut your
[33:30] heart
[33:31] right because it's unclean living you've
[33:34] got a head
[33:36] your husband your head we're going to
[33:37] read the scripture
[33:39] but we're gonna just
[33:41] look at the next one now both of these
[33:43] are in 1953 and I thank God that they
[33:45] would real early
[33:47] because you can't say change is mine
[33:49] later yeah
[33:51] all right then you're going to say well
[33:53] now brother Dale after the seals broke
[33:56] well we're gonna redact the seals bro
[33:59] okay
[34:00] but here's the two statements so look at
[34:03] what he's saying your questions and
[34:04] answers on Genesis 19 53 729 paragraph
[34:08] 76. he said I had a hot one on that one
[34:13] the other day in Shreveport they was
[34:15] talking about the woman
[34:17] and should women wear long hair and I
[34:20] said a woman that bought her her husband
[34:22] had a right and a Bible right to divorce
[34:25] her that's right that's what the Bible
[34:28] said that's exactly right oh my Holy
[34:30] Ghost women's sitting dire
[34:33] just the way they've been taught
[34:36] me that's all please yes that's Luke
[34:40] Smith and if he said now if they would
[34:42] cut it if there's something wrong they
[34:45] had to cut and they put something wrong
[34:47] had they had to cut their hair said let
[34:51] her take a razor and shave it off
[34:54] and make her higher real slick until it
[34:56] comes out her head that's exactly that's
[35:00] right that's what the scripture said it
[35:03] says if she cuts her higher she
[35:05] dishonors her husband and a woman does
[35:08] dishonorable has a legal right to be put
[35:10] away in divorce but he can't marry again
[35:13] now
[35:15] all right so we're putting that in there
[35:17] to make sure
[35:18] but he but he can put her away in
[35:21] divorcement that's right that's the
[35:23] scripture oh brother what we need is
[35:26] some some question nights that's right
[35:30] that's First Corinthians the 14th which
[35:33] really will get to us the 13th if you
[35:35] want to read it all right now that that
[35:38] now this women all right so let's go to
[35:41] First Corinthians
[35:42] I think I gave it to you to pull up
[35:44] didn't umbrella
[35:46] First Corinthians 11.
[35:49] and I put it on Brother Anderson if not
[35:52] turn in your Bible First Corinthians 11.
[35:54] all right
[35:56] because he says 14 there but I think
[35:58] that he was meaning
[36:01] First Corinthians 11. all right
[36:04] whatever let's go you can read the 14th
[36:07] and might find something but maybe
[36:08] they'll get it up there in a minute
[36:10] because you could turn right over and
[36:12] start uh First Corinthians 11 verse
[36:15] we'll go over verse 2.
[36:18] let's go verse one I love it be your
[36:21] father to the man is all and I also am
[36:24] of Christ
[36:25] another word follow I want to say now
[36:28] what do you say did I follow what Christ
[36:30] says okay man
[36:32] because I am to you Christ is that just
[36:34] point right okay
[36:37] may I Praise You Brethren that you
[36:40] remember me in all things and keep the
[36:41] ordinances as I delivered them to you
[36:46] now keep the ordinances
[36:49] now this is an ordinance
[36:52] to be delivered
[36:54] but what have you know that the head of
[36:56] every man is Christ and the heavier the
[36:58] woman is the man
[36:59] and the head of Christ is God okay we're
[37:02] getting a little
[37:03] there
[37:05] so then we cover the man and the woman
[37:08] verse 4 says every man praying or
[37:11] prophesying having his head covered
[37:13] dishonoreth his head which is
[37:15] dishonoring Christ
[37:16] all right that's why we don't wear a hat
[37:19] in church
[37:19] we don't come in here and do if I'm up
[37:22] here even working I remove my hat while
[37:25] in here working
[37:27] I'm always trying to do that all right
[37:29] because I don't want that covering but I
[37:32] don't want my hair hanging down because
[37:34] that's really what it's talking about
[37:35] right amen right right no just going to
[37:38] turn around to her to her
[37:39] so a man with her running all down his
[37:42] back and all these long looking hippie
[37:44] things
[37:50] all right amen so then he's dishonorable
[37:54] oh you know what God deals with that
[37:56] the dishonor his hand which is
[37:58] dishonoring cry but every woman that
[38:00] prayers or prophesied with her head
[38:01] uncovered
[38:03] dishonor of her head for that is even
[38:07] all is as if she were shaving okay now
[38:11] women the older women used to wear what
[38:14] some of them still do a hat
[38:17] my mother-in-law would not go to church
[38:20] without a hat on
[38:23] if she would go out in the sun and be
[38:25] out she would be in the rain man I'm not
[38:27] joking but she wouldn't go to church
[38:29] without the Hat on because they believed
[38:31] that
[38:32] but it doesn't say her hat is a covering
[38:35] right right
[38:37] all right she'll read the scripture but
[38:39] every woman praying or prophesying with
[38:40] her head uncovered
[38:44] now remember
[38:47] tough right
[38:50] well brother Dale my hair who's that
[38:52] lady that sings
[38:54] Crystal Gayle she's got higher long
[38:57] enough to reach from here
[38:58] Jimbo
[39:01] I saw that one day on something now my
[39:04] Lord
[39:05] and she's a worldly person it is I mean
[39:07] he just rolls down on the floor behind
[39:11] I don't know whether she's ever cut it
[39:14] or what I figure she probably does you
[39:17] know to straighten it up to do this that
[39:18] another but my point is
[39:21] it's not how long the higher is
[39:25] some people at higher don't grow long
[39:30] black people's Tire don't grow long
[39:32] right
[39:34] it curled up
[39:36] it don't grow long
[39:38] you know all right now if you see with a
[39:40] woman black woman with long hair there's
[39:42] some whites in their generation
[39:43] somewhere that's plain language that's
[39:45] not going off on nobody it's just in
[39:47] case somebody comes along starts to say
[39:49] something well that already covered that
[39:56] down to longer higher because the hair
[39:58] doesn't grow so it's not how long the
[40:01] hair is
[40:04] see the old saying how long and long
[40:08] okay
[40:11] my definition
[40:15] you take a rope you stretch it out
[40:18] now you don't never cut it no words long
[40:21] right
[40:22] but if you cut one quarter of an inch
[40:25] off it ain't long no more
[40:28] right right because you cut off some of
[40:31] it
[40:32] all right so now sisters if you just
[40:34] trim your hair and I said here your head
[40:36] is uncovered
[40:40] the prophet of God said God won't hear
[40:43] the prayer of a bobcat woman
[40:47] now you argue with him about it you say
[40:49] well I know a lady that's on TV that he
[40:51] right that's a gift
[40:53] right
[40:55] come on that's a gift in her
[40:57] that's a gift that's working that's what
[40:59] other people receiving from the gift
[41:02] your Prophet said it I didn't you need
[41:04] that quote
[41:05] God won't hear the prayer of a bobcat
[41:07] woman well brother I remember when I was
[41:09] cutting my heart and God heard my
[41:11] prayers you better thank God he did amen
[41:15] you shouldn't be upset with me about it
[41:17] to express it in the wrong way you want
[41:19] to say thank God he heard me
[41:23] you ought to cry out and enjoy that he
[41:25] did hear you right because he baptized
[41:28] all the prophets words in the scripture
[41:30] to hear you
[41:33] come on that's good
[41:36] if she prayeth or prophesied we're gonna
[41:39] hit him covered
[41:44] or if the woman be not covered
[41:47] let her be shown
[41:49] but if it'd be a shame for a woman to be
[41:51] sworn or shaven then let her be covered
[41:56] now covered means not how long it is
[42:01] covered means not being cut
[42:04] do you understand
[42:09] it's not a hat
[42:12] if the woman's higher that's not being
[42:15] cut is recovering but if she's trimming
[42:17] the edge she's doing away with her honor
[42:19] and Glory
[42:23] continue I didn't want to preach this
[42:26] message for sure but
[42:29] all right
[42:30] but I like to be nice
[42:33] birth the woman be not covered let her
[42:36] also be showing but it's to be a shame
[42:38] for a woman to be short or shaven
[42:40] let her be covered all right
[42:43] for a man indeed ought to not did not
[42:46] cover his head for as much as he is the
[42:48] image and glory of God but the woman is
[42:50] the glory of the man so what does it
[42:51] mean now the command not can't wear a
[42:53] hat
[42:55] right
[42:57] now if you're dealing with a woman's
[42:59] higher why don't you think you're
[43:00] dealing with a man's higher
[43:03] yep all right
[43:05] a man's higher is is it the fact that
[43:08] he's covering himself with his heart
[43:10] so then that would be wrong
[43:13] yep now I'm sure we'll get into it one
[43:16] of these days
[43:18] because somebody will come here with
[43:20] these turbines on and we'll ask them to
[43:22] remove it and they'll probably refuse to
[43:24] do it
[43:24] and cause a big stake
[43:27] well I've already been to their places
[43:29] and I've done honor to their honor I
[43:33] took my shoes off when I go into the
[43:36] place and I will quickly ask the person
[43:37] can it be that
[43:41] if I come to your place do I got to pull
[43:43] my shoes off yeah
[43:46] think all right
[43:48] looking into it because I'm Satan here
[43:50] sitting you bring it up all right all
[43:52] right
[43:53] but see the woman is the glory of the
[43:56] man
[43:59] a real true life is the greatest thing
[44:02] brother said God could give you outside
[44:04] of Salvation
[44:06] now that's something
[44:08] behind ever a good man is a what
[44:12] a good one because the wind is now in
[44:15] front of every good man yeah I'm changed
[44:18] a little now but you know we're in a
[44:21] different world
[44:22] but look for the man see now watch
[44:26] but the woman is to go to the man for
[44:27] the man is not of the woman
[44:30] that's right hey I had a mama I come
[44:33] from a woman we're not talking about
[44:34] that
[44:35] but who come first
[44:38] that's right
[44:41] Eve was in Adam right
[44:44] Joe it wasn't the man the woman coming
[44:46] first
[44:48] that's what it's saying for a man is not
[44:50] of the woman
[44:52] but
[44:53] but the woman is of the man
[44:57] neither was the Man created for the
[45:00] woman
[45:02] listen
[45:03] but the woman for the man right
[45:07] you realize
[45:10] now come on Brothers all you men that's
[45:11] got wives think about it you know that
[45:13] God taught enough of you to give you a
[45:15] good life amen amen yes sir
[45:18] he gave you a good gift amen right
[45:21] my wife always said to me she said honey
[45:23] you would have been born and you've
[45:25] already been a while you call it a
[45:27] Hermit in the form but not that word but
[45:30] meaning that you know I would not have
[45:32] never got married
[45:34] you know in order to just say to myself
[45:36] and that way I could preach and do
[45:37] things I said but I wouldn't made to be
[45:39] that way
[45:41] I wasn't made to be without a wife
[45:44] of course you didn't understand that I
[45:46] was 18 she was 16. We Got Married pretty
[45:48] quick so that no problem right right
[45:51] but look what it's to say
[45:55] the woman was created for the man
[45:59] why because Adam was lonely
[46:05] yeah God to fellowship with he had all
[46:08] the animals to fellowship with
[46:09] but you're still lonely
[46:12] and you don't run around and said God
[46:13] was lonely
[46:15] and so that's why he created man that's
[46:17] for fellowship and he created a woman to
[46:20] be with Fellowship
[46:23] with her husband
[46:25] not two husbands now
[46:27] you know that's wrong former Fellowship
[46:30] you know that's not exactly right now
[46:33] watch what it's for this call the woman
[46:34] to have power on her head
[46:37] because of the Angels
[46:39] I'm not sure to have power on her head
[46:41] so what she meant in other words you
[46:43] ought to have long hair
[46:45] I was at your glory what was Samson's uh
[46:48] Power
[46:50] right right it was he's higher right it
[46:53] was really in the promise of God but we
[46:55] still know the other card work all right
[46:57] now
[46:59] you ought to have power in other words
[47:00] she ought to honor her head
[47:04] she's made to be a health meat not a
[47:07] master
[47:09] all right now look
[47:11] because of the Angels now run around
[47:13] them there's a quote for this if you'd
[47:15] like it he said goes in churches
[47:16] Messengers are going to blast that thing
[47:18] that's the way he said it when you read
[47:21] that scripture about the cause of the
[47:23] Angels the
[47:26] he said them Church age Messengers are
[47:28] going to blast that
[47:29] right
[47:31] now
[47:33] nevertheless neither is The Man Without
[47:35] The Woman neither the woman without the
[47:37] man
[47:38] and the Lord number one back to what I
[47:41] said this morning
[47:43] man and his wife is a type of Christ in
[47:45] the church not a man and a whole lot of
[47:48] wives that typology ended at Calvary
[47:52] now he's Christ in the church coming
[47:54] down sure and many members which you
[47:57] know what
[47:58] it's just like David was he had a
[48:01] thousand or I remember Solomon one had a
[48:03] thousand but you know what they could
[48:04] neither one of them could have another
[48:05] man and you know they would ever one hit
[48:07] while singer
[48:09] he had a thousand singular wives you
[48:12] know what I mean each one of them and
[48:15] each one of us is an individual in their
[48:17] body of Christ
[48:19] he's my savior you've got to believe
[48:22] he's yours all right now
[48:25] or as a woman is off the man and watch
[48:29] even so is the man also by the woman
[48:35] huh
[48:37] but all things of God nor would we come
[48:39] from a woman
[48:41] we come from the morning with men we
[48:44] come from a woman right
[48:46] look you do it in the right order come
[48:48] on judging yourself is it commonly for a
[48:50] woman to pray unto God uncovered
[48:53] huh does not even nature itself teach
[48:56] you
[48:57] if a man have long hair it is a shame
[49:00] unto him
[49:04] yeah nature is the nature of a man ought
[49:09] to be that he has short hair
[49:12] now short don't have to be shaved heads
[49:16] all right
[49:19] I never said nothing around here about
[49:21] some of you know someone had to say hey
[49:23] you need to get a haircut
[49:25] huh but
[49:27] see
[49:30] he
[49:32] in nature his nature ought to be to be a
[49:34] man
[49:35] yeah and I can't help it I'm sorry now
[49:38] if you think I'm wrong you wouldn't do
[49:39] it and I see you walking around with
[49:41] long hair
[49:42] I'm going to say he's a Tinkerbell
[49:45] that's too old for most of you to know
[49:48] language out there on the internet and
[49:49] around here
[49:51] you plainly means I think he's too close
[49:53] to his feminine side
[49:57] well you know okay
[49:59] that's me
[50:01] all right
[50:02] let's see the woman
[50:04] her hire is her honor and glory amen
[50:06] right man
[50:09] but now let's go back to that Nature
[50:11] Park
[50:12] I like to put natural and spiritual
[50:14] together
[50:15] you know in nature
[50:17] animal shelter all right that's right
[50:20] I'll throw it back right
[50:24] winter time
[50:26] the park is long
[50:28] right stay warm summertime it sheds off
[50:33] it's all natural instrument okay
[50:37] not even nature Chef teach you this a
[50:39] man have a long harass or shame unto him
[50:41] but if a woman had a long hair it is a
[50:44] glory to her I remember long means long
[50:48] means not being cut
[50:52] right don't mean four foot
[50:55] it means not being cut to a man that has
[50:59] higher that's not being cut
[51:02] now don't come up with me or anywhere
[51:05] else around here I think when I wouldn't
[51:06] do it come up and say Jesus had a long
[51:09] hair we brought around and said he had
[51:11] shoulder length higher now you argued
[51:13] the point with brother Branham he said
[51:15] he had shoulder length higher all right
[51:17] you said well Samson had to her
[51:20] I'll agree because here's the statement
[51:22] I've always made
[51:24] if you will men will live the life
[51:28] example of Jesus Christ
[51:30] and let Christ be as he was I mean God
[51:34] be in you like he was in Christ your
[51:37] heart can drag the ground
[51:41] I don't have no problem
[51:44] if you have the Life of Christ right
[51:47] because you know what you're going to do
[51:48] you got the Life of Christ
[51:50] you're gonna make it look presumable
[51:54] and not go around flipping it
[52:00] but if it won't have long hair should
[52:03] glory to her for her hair is giving her
[52:06] or a cover
[52:10] now here's the one a lot of people relay
[52:12] on
[52:14] but if any man seem to be contentious
[52:17] which means arguing debate and fuss
[52:20] we have no such custom
[52:23] now they say that means that there's no
[52:25] custom about the hiring or nothing
[52:28] no that's not what it's saying right
[52:32] I'm not going to argue with you about
[52:34] anything about the haircut or whatever
[52:36] just tell you like it is
[52:38] and leave it alone but if it may seem to
[52:40] be content somebody wants to argue with
[52:42] you
[52:44] all right
[52:45] come on
[52:48] no wait what you are come on all right
[52:51] well do you understand then why her hair
[52:54] being her covering
[52:58] long hire which means uncut now here's a
[53:01] quote
[53:03] they asked brother Brown on something
[53:05] similar to that and there's a quote to
[53:06] these verbatim words
[53:08] this woman quits cutting her hair
[53:13] you could come in here and you could
[53:14] have her short as mine
[53:17] yeah
[53:19] in the day you see that and you say
[53:21] ain't gonna cut it no more
[53:23] do you know that in God your higher is
[53:25] 40 foot long if that's what it needs to
[53:27] be
[53:29] he said that ain't gonna be no
[53:31] short-haired women over on that other
[53:33] side does that mean all the black
[53:35] people's tires got to run down somewhere
[53:37] and uncurl what kind of ceiling this are
[53:39] you
[53:41] uncut
[53:43] yep uncut hair
[53:47] so then the length of it your sisters
[53:50] know it my wife's hair used to be way on
[53:52] down you know it still is long in some
[53:54] points in the middle but she doesn't
[53:56] have the massive heart she used to have
[53:58] one because it's naturally going to
[54:00] break off
[54:06] no
[54:08] and you know yourself I've never beat on
[54:10] to you about it like preachers say that
[54:12] you ought not get a perm put it in your
[54:13] heart
[54:14] I can't read where blood around said
[54:16] that so I just don't say nothing about
[54:17] it
[54:19] but if you're having the perm put in
[54:20] there to make yourself worldly then you
[54:23] need to check yourself that's all they
[54:25] got and all I've ever said to anybody my
[54:27] daughter or anybody if you're doing it
[54:28] you know with my wife she's never had
[54:30] one at least since we've been married
[54:32] but anyhow uh I'm just honest about it
[54:36] put it in the right respect but get the
[54:39] whole point man what's the whole point
[54:41] you're saying brother Dale
[54:43] long hair is hired it's not being cut
[54:46] anything if it's 40 foot long and you
[54:49] cut one inch off it's no longer long
[54:51] right until you're out of the scripture
[54:53] right right okay solve the problem
[54:56] well I need to do this well that's all
[54:58] right
[54:59] you go talk to God about what you need
[55:01] to do now remember we went through
[55:03] though
[55:04] two quotes that he could put her away
[55:07] for cutting her hair but you cannot
[55:08] remarry because of the grounds of her
[55:10] cutting her hair
[55:12] so then you know now to you brothers and
[55:16] things and to the people why would you
[55:20] want to press the issue
[55:23] of divorcing your wife issues an
[55:26] unbeliever
[55:28] did I answer did I say that the way that
[55:30] it went out you know if she's an
[55:32] unbeliever
[55:35] issues an unbeliever she's going to cut
[55:36] her hiring
[55:38] do you want you do you want a divorce
[55:42] are you hunting for a reason to do it
[55:44] right
[55:45] all right
[55:46] please shoot an unbeliever now a woman
[55:49] that is a believer
[55:51] now that's where we get to it you're
[55:53] gonna see that that's purely flag of
[55:56] fornication
[55:59] for a woman that claims to be a
[56:01] Christian because right
[56:03] amen
[56:05] now how else can you say that he's got
[56:07] in the grounds you're going to make
[56:08] brother Brown come on you're going to
[56:09] make brother Brown and say just exactly
[56:11] what he had just got to say that those
[56:13] Pharisees was trying to say that you
[56:16] could put away your wife or any copper
[56:18] well see here it run around and get some
[56:19] cobbles
[56:21] other than an adulterous act you know
[56:23] racial sexual intercourse he gives a
[56:25] call
[56:26] who is evidently looking at something
[56:28] spiritual and bringing it on into the
[56:31] being of the person and connecting the
[56:34] natural and the spiritual together of a
[56:36] wife
[56:37] you know amen and putting it into that
[56:40] place now let's give some quotes from
[56:41] just to see what he has to say okay uh
[56:44] let's see so we gave the two that said
[56:47] that he can put her away but he cannot
[56:49] remarry
[56:50] all right let's go to number three
[56:53] okay and forgive me for reading a bunch
[56:55] we'll try to read as nice as we can and
[56:57] then when I do that I generally miss
[56:58] work so forgive me you read it
[57:02] the worst sinner in the city
[57:04] I remember that one and I remember the
[57:07] meanest man
[57:08] like boy I listened to that Tate and one
[57:10] time it said about the invasion of the
[57:12] U.S man I grabbed that tape
[57:14] the worst centered in the city all right
[57:18] I got 73. let me tell you something a
[57:21] lot of you women tonight
[57:23] would have an awful time doing that and
[57:25] he's just talking about Jesus with the
[57:28] dirty feet you know right and the woman
[57:31] had to wash Jesus his feet with her
[57:33] heart that's what he's explaining just
[57:35] prior to this and watch what he says now
[57:39] awful time in doing that you'd have to
[57:41] stand on your head to do it
[57:43] shame on you the Bible said to her is
[57:45] given to a woman for her glory and the
[57:47] Bible
[57:48] gives rights gives any man a right to
[57:52] leave and divorce his wife and leave her
[57:54] that'll cut her hair that's the Bible
[57:59] you gonna read the rest of that
[58:02] thus saith the Lord right
[58:06] wait a minute now
[58:09] too bad you got away from the
[58:11] old-fashioned training feeling
[58:13] if you'll notice when if you'll check
[58:15] these you'll find out Jesus and not just
[58:18] at the Tabernacle all the time
[58:20] but look what he said he said if that's
[58:22] just saith the Lord
[58:27] it must not have been brought around
[58:29] talking right
[58:31] next one number four
[58:33] life preached in 1958 5 19 paragraph e
[58:38] 46. it's time the church took its
[58:41] position
[58:43] and come out of the things of the world
[58:45] you know what it used to be that it was
[58:47] wrong for a Christian woman in the
[58:49] Holiness groups to wear a short hired
[58:51] what happened I can remember when you
[58:54] couldn't be when you couldn't be taken
[58:57] into the church with short hair
[59:03] I still are strong man he said I
[59:05] remember when you couldn't be taken to
[59:06] the church for sure
[59:10] it was wrong in the first place
[59:13] it's wrong yet
[59:14] the Bible said that if a woman cuts her
[59:17] hair
[59:18] her husband has a right to divorce her
[59:20] and get away from her that's exactly
[59:24] that's exactly right what do you do it
[59:28] for
[59:29] to follow fashion
[59:33] now you're not going to like me after
[59:35] this but at the Judgment bar you're
[59:37] going to find out something the Bible
[59:40] said
[59:41] if a woman cuts her hair she dishonors
[59:43] her head which is her husband and she's
[59:47] a dishonorable person she should be put
[59:50] away it used to be wrong but something
[59:52] happened
[59:55] okay going to the next one
[1:00:00] it's 1958 Jesus at the door uh 529
[1:00:04] paragraph e 36 the Bible claims that the
[1:00:08] woman cuts her hair or in lock her
[1:00:11] husband has a right to divorce her and
[1:00:12] send her away the Bible said so she
[1:00:15] dishonors her husband and a dishonorable
[1:00:17] woman shouldn't be lived with all you
[1:00:19] say I'm just as pure as a Lily that
[1:00:22] might be true sister it's because the
[1:00:24] preacher never told you about it or
[1:00:26] either your stubborn will that wouldn't
[1:00:28] let God come in maybe it didn't come
[1:00:31] into the preacher's heart
[1:00:33] and hit it all right go to the next
[1:00:37] the mark of the beast
[1:00:39] 1961-16 paragraph E15 what we need today
[1:00:43] is men we need gospel preachers and any
[1:00:45] preacher that will stand in the pulpit
[1:00:47] and hold back on those stains I got a
[1:00:50] little respect for him being called of
[1:00:52] God
[1:00:52] right a man that's ashamed to stand in
[1:00:55] the pulpit and tell God's truth when he
[1:00:57] knows it's an immoral thing
[1:01:01] are you ready
[1:01:03] immoral
[1:01:06] thing
[1:01:08] for a woman to cut her hair the Bible
[1:01:12] a man's got a right to leave his wife
[1:01:15] and give her divorce when you cut your
[1:01:17] heart
[1:01:21] the Bible said so who's the head of the
[1:01:24] woman her husband and the Bible said If
[1:01:26] a woman cuts her hair she dishonors her
[1:01:29] head no dishonorable woman should be
[1:01:31] lived with amen she cuts off her glory
[1:01:35] and so does the church when she does the
[1:01:38] same thing she cuts her glory stream off
[1:01:41] all right so now laying it down immortal
[1:01:46] dishonest
[1:01:48] all kind of things okay
[1:01:51] number seven
[1:01:54] 1961 520 from that time paragraph East
[1:01:58] 61. I was speaking this morning of this
[1:02:01] woman and moral woman watching Jesus's
[1:02:04] Dirty Feet washing them with wiping them
[1:02:06] with her some of our Pentecostal sisters
[1:02:09] have to stand on their head to get
[1:02:11] enough hair to wash the feet cut it all
[1:02:13] off see that's right it used to be wrong
[1:02:15] for you to do that you're still wrong
[1:02:17] for you to do it the bible plan that
[1:02:19] teaches a woman cuts her higher her
[1:02:22] husband has a right to divorce her put
[1:02:23] her away said as she cuts her higher she
[1:02:26] dishonors her head her husband and a
[1:02:28] dishonorable woman should not be lived
[1:02:30] with I better shut up I'll get you
[1:02:33] preachers right here
[1:02:35] I'm only telling you the truth you're
[1:02:38] going to face me with it at the day of
[1:02:40] judgment
[1:02:41] that's thus saith the Lord in his word
[1:02:44] now we've got two statements on the best
[1:02:46] day of the Lord okay next one
[1:02:49] watch the years it just goes up and you
[1:02:51] say well he changed his Doctrine
[1:02:54] does he changed it
[1:02:57] 1963 is your life life worthy of the
[1:03:00] Gospel paragraph 223 they cut their hair
[1:03:04] where in the worldly clothes walked out
[1:03:06] on the street like that and God's Bible
[1:03:07] warns against it even for the bridge is
[1:03:09] a woman to even pray with Bob and her
[1:03:11] and said to the man and she does that
[1:03:13] she claims herself to her husband and
[1:03:16] watch
[1:03:17] she does that now
[1:03:19] she claims herself to her husband
[1:03:22] that she's immoral herself and a perfect
[1:03:25] right to give her a divorce and send her
[1:03:27] away from him
[1:03:29] that's exactly right the word of God
[1:03:31] saying that and a woman hear that and
[1:03:34] continue to wear short hair and call
[1:03:37] herself a Christian if that isn't a
[1:03:39] neurotic
[1:03:42] what is a neurotic I want somebody to
[1:03:44] tell me what is a neurotic the whole
[1:03:47] message that I was talking about in your
[1:03:48] audience so go look up new rides and
[1:03:50] find out what it is all right click the
[1:03:52] next one
[1:03:59] um I put that one in I think so I've
[1:04:01] been trying to do it by years but now I
[1:04:03] put this in okay this is 1956 painting
[1:04:05] face Jezebel
[1:04:07] um 1005 I got E4 24. and so we find
[1:04:11] Jezebel tiring her head
[1:04:15] which was cutting her hair
[1:04:18] rolling it up tiring her head every how
[1:04:21] you say that t-i-r-i-n-g
[1:04:23] which is a disgrace the woman that cuts
[1:04:25] her hair dishonors her husband the Bible
[1:04:27] said so a dishonorable woman should be
[1:04:29] divorced and put away so that's a sign
[1:04:32] that she loves somebody else
[1:04:38] according to the Bible
[1:04:42] because she dishonors her husband when
[1:04:45] she does it
[1:04:47] now
[1:04:48] who's your lover your husband
[1:04:51] that is your head
[1:04:53] her Fashions her world or things
[1:05:00] he said it's a sign that she loves
[1:05:02] somebody else
[1:05:05] right okay
[1:05:07] go to the next one
[1:05:12] 1962-17 presuming project 255 and you
[1:05:16] women that haven't that hasn't the
[1:05:18] common decency to let your heart grow
[1:05:19] out like God told you to that's right
[1:05:22] the Bible said in a woman that above her
[1:05:24] higher dishonors her head
[1:05:27] and her that dishonor her husband and
[1:05:31] you that'll wear these little garments
[1:05:32] and interested in the world and the
[1:05:34] Bible goes on go to the next one we're
[1:05:36] just stand with the heart we're not
[1:05:37] going to get on the other thing
[1:05:38] and noise that not 1965 818 paragraph
[1:05:42] 176 through 179 basically going when you
[1:05:46] get down through the church and how
[1:05:48] they're cutting off their hiring the
[1:05:49] different things and making fun of you
[1:05:52] or God's word said it's a shame for a
[1:05:54] woman to cut her hair she will dishonor
[1:05:57] her head if she dishonors her husband
[1:05:59] and her husband is the church
[1:06:03] and the church is Christ
[1:06:05] she is a dishonorable religious
[1:06:07] prostitute
[1:06:10] naked and don't know it
[1:06:13] naked don't the Bible said the woman's
[1:06:16] covering is her heart is with the her
[1:06:19] gift to her for recovery
[1:06:22] he uses prostitute and naked
[1:06:27] brother now I don't like this
[1:06:29] you think I do
[1:06:33] but is it a trip right amen all right
[1:06:35] what do we got do we got any more
[1:06:37] trying to get down right all right yeah
[1:06:40] choose a little bride
[1:06:42] 65. right I got 157. and just look what
[1:06:46] science has done for her she comes out
[1:06:49] first with her hair chopped off with one
[1:06:51] of these Jacqueline Kennedy hardoo see
[1:06:54] or something like that and you know what
[1:06:56] the Bible said the Bible actually gives
[1:06:59] a man
[1:07:00] if he wants to
[1:07:03] I chose this specifically if he wants to
[1:07:08] all right the right to put her away in
[1:07:11] this divorcement
[1:07:13] if she does that she's a dishonorable
[1:07:15] woman that'll cut her hair and the Bible
[1:07:16] said so right didn't know that huh oh
[1:07:20] yeah I preached too much in California
[1:07:22] for you not know that that's right oh
[1:07:25] yeah what good does it do to me they do
[1:07:28] it anyhow you can't take the pig and
[1:07:30] change his name make him a lamb you see
[1:07:34] what he said you can't change the pig
[1:07:35] you can change his nature he didn't say
[1:07:37] that you could change his name ain't
[1:07:39] doing no good he's still a pig change
[1:07:41] his nature okay I think we got one more
[1:07:44] marriage and divorce
[1:07:46] 1965 221 in the morning service
[1:07:49] paragraph 243 but to get this marriage
[1:07:52] in divorce straightened out don't you
[1:07:54] know which was right and which was wrong
[1:07:56] they plan the shows you're in these
[1:07:58] types there is one Christ and many
[1:08:00] members of that wife noticed he can't
[1:08:02] put us away
[1:08:04] for Spiritual fornication
[1:08:07] and false Doctrine now we get onto this
[1:08:09] later on
[1:08:10] I'm just putting it in because it's
[1:08:12] where I wanted it the statement to be
[1:08:13] made where you remember it anytime he
[1:08:16] wants to and how dare you to try to put
[1:08:18] him away and make it the man can put
[1:08:20] away his wife and marry another one
[1:08:23] but not the one foot away her husband
[1:08:25] didn't wear another see all the shadows
[1:08:28] and tops are perfectly balanced now we
[1:08:31] have went over and over and over to show
[1:08:33] he can't put away his wife for just any
[1:08:36] calls you can't put her away for burning
[1:08:38] the bread you can't do this it's got to
[1:08:41] be something related to fornication
[1:08:44] so then when a woman cuts her higher
[1:08:48] knowing that it should not be done now
[1:08:50] we've covered that
[1:08:51] a man married to an unbeliever who
[1:08:54] shouldn't expect her to be any different
[1:08:57] right I mean he should realize today
[1:09:01] she's going to do these things
[1:09:03] and a woman that claims to be a
[1:09:04] Christian
[1:09:06] he said in our Holy Ghost women
[1:09:08] didn't know because it hadn't been told
[1:09:11] all right
[1:09:12] now you may argue from now on or you may
[1:09:15] have argued before but I could this
[1:09:16] message is done we just read if you want
[1:09:19] to go through it we just read that a
[1:09:21] woman cutting her hair is immoral she's
[1:09:23] a prostitute she is a dishonorable
[1:09:27] she is a fornicator
[1:09:30] yes right he's covered a lot of things
[1:09:32] that hides together with your hair right
[1:09:36] go see Church Sisters people out there
[1:09:39] listening if we're Christians we're not
[1:09:42] supposed to argue about whether what
[1:09:43] something is right or wrong
[1:09:45] amen we should believe it and walk on
[1:09:48] well it don't make no difference I'm
[1:09:50] gonna cut my heart bless God they Ain't
[1:09:52] Gonna Keep Me Out of Heaven it won't
[1:09:54] keep you out of heaven for cutting your
[1:09:55] heart that's right
[1:09:57] it'll keep you out of Heaven the
[1:09:59] attitude you had when you just made that
[1:10:02] statement
[1:10:04] do you understand right amen nothing
[1:10:08] wrong to be wrong
[1:10:10] right it's wrong to stay wrong that's
[1:10:13] right that's it
[1:10:14] right no problem with being wrong we're
[1:10:17] all been wrong
[1:10:18] but when we stay wrong right
[1:10:20] now we got a problem
[1:10:24] you see somebody arguing and fussing
[1:10:27] about because that you showed the truth
[1:10:33] then you know who's wrong
[1:10:40] I knew you would have always preached
[1:10:42] wrong for a woman to cut her hair but I
[1:10:43] never tied it together with the fact of
[1:10:45] him kindness together with it
[1:10:47] fornication
[1:10:50] right
[1:10:52] because the only grounds for a man to
[1:10:54] put away his life is what did she commit
[1:10:57] fornication
[1:10:59] the only thing that he says the
[1:11:01] difference about the fornication of a
[1:11:03] natural point
[1:11:05] and the fornication of women cutting
[1:11:07] their hair is that for cutting your
[1:11:09] higher the man can put her away but he
[1:11:11] cannot marry because of her doing that
[1:11:14] that's right so why would you want to go
[1:11:16] do those things right pray for your wife
[1:11:19] yeah
[1:11:20] but now I do agree with one thing
[1:11:25] I mean that little while she gets up her
[1:11:27] heels bud and she tells you bless God
[1:11:29] you won't tell me we just won't go back
[1:11:31] a little no more
[1:11:33] yeah on the internet we just won't
[1:11:36] listen no more
[1:11:38] brother Joe gave me a report there a
[1:11:40] while ago that covers the cost of our
[1:11:42] internet system
[1:11:44] for one year not counting all the
[1:11:46] workers do for one year is 2441 dollars
[1:11:49] that we're putting out every year to try
[1:11:51] to send the message to someone else so
[1:11:53] you know they're out there on the
[1:11:55] internet we hadn't asked you for a dime
[1:11:56] never ask you for nothing
[1:11:58] that you take what we've said and see
[1:12:01] whether it's a profits message or not
[1:12:03] I've got a quote that I didn't bring but
[1:12:05] I saw one this morning I was looking and
[1:12:07] rode around and said well my pastor he
[1:12:09] said if you're a pastor don't agree with
[1:12:11] the word get real get away from me right
[1:12:13] please that's what you say
[1:12:15] man well brother Dale you're trying to
[1:12:18] bust up churches no no don't have to
[1:12:19] worry about it
[1:12:21] because if we bust up any and they feel
[1:12:23] us full we got to build on
[1:12:25] glad you're coming
[1:12:27] you know glad you're coming but we're
[1:12:30] already talking about having to build on
[1:12:32] all right that's fine but we're gonna
[1:12:35] put out seats before we build on
[1:12:37] we may have some winter units to cover
[1:12:40] this hidden system sometimes but you
[1:12:42] know we're not going to jump into a
[1:12:43] whole lot until we get everything
[1:12:45] needful all right
[1:12:48] amen the church
[1:12:49] why wouldn't we as men want to do what
[1:12:52] God says anymore right
[1:12:58] why wouldn't we wanna
[1:13:00] sister why wouldn't you want to do what
[1:13:02] God says and say you're a Christian
[1:13:05] just remember especially your sisters it
[1:13:08] doesn't show up in men because we're
[1:13:10] just men
[1:13:11] you know now come on
[1:13:13] that's why I really don't like it you go
[1:13:15] out here and somebody goes riding by and
[1:13:16] they say well brother Dale we saw a
[1:13:17] bunch of long-haired men out there
[1:13:19] they're going to ask you why you'd you
[1:13:22] don't believe in that do you know
[1:13:24] and they go finally see a win some women
[1:13:27] you know when they say shorts and talk
[1:13:28] well you don't believe in that dude but
[1:13:30] no I don't believe me well they was out
[1:13:32] there in front of your charger
[1:13:34] well
[1:13:35] we try out with Grace we try to
[1:13:37] understand first time a sister comes in
[1:13:39] wearing pants we don't get on to her my
[1:13:42] defense is instructed not to say nothing
[1:13:44] give them a little time
[1:13:46] and they've had them to come here that
[1:13:48] some of this even setting years come
[1:13:50] here they didn't know it was wrong to
[1:13:52] wear pants but after a while you find
[1:13:53] out and then you could do anything
[1:13:55] that's good
[1:13:56] that's Grace
[1:14:02] well why wouldn't we want to serve God
[1:14:04] amen and remember now sisters
[1:14:10] it was your fault
[1:14:13] we're not we're not gloating hollering
[1:14:15] and screaming is your fault
[1:14:20] but I also say it's the man's fault
[1:14:23] if he lets his wife run him around right
[1:14:26] right that's right in order amen
[1:14:31] now what is the ground on what you call
[1:14:34] that
[1:14:39] see most men wouldn't agree with the way
[1:14:40] me and my wife do it but I think that's
[1:14:42] all right that's me and my wife
[1:14:44] she pays the beetle she takes care of
[1:14:46] everything I don't know what's in the
[1:14:48] bank
[1:14:48] but I know the bills are paid because I
[1:14:50] get to matter if the letters is the post
[1:14:51] talk I mean you know when the mailbox I
[1:14:53] know what's going on
[1:14:55] and all that but people would say well
[1:14:58] your wife runs your business
[1:15:01] okay okay if I tell her too sure saved
[1:15:05] me a lot of trouble and she's a cash the
[1:15:08] Elder don't understand it they actually
[1:15:10] are known for safety
[1:15:12] we tried to instill that to the kids but
[1:15:15] the problem was they got the Dale
[1:15:17] they missed the cash
[1:15:19] so now all the kids is going to Rams
[1:15:23] Dave Ramsey to learn how to save money
[1:15:24] when if they didn't listen to their
[1:15:26] mother the whole time they would have
[1:15:27] been sitting in Tip-Top shape right
[1:15:29] today
[1:15:31] but that's right
[1:15:33] amen
[1:15:36] and like I told Brothers Gerald Hughes
[1:15:38] kind of comical
[1:15:39] at least we talked about something that
[1:15:41] somebody brought up and I said well you
[1:15:43] know I'm even paying for the people to
[1:15:45] go to this Dave Ramsey
[1:15:47] you paying for artists you haven't pay
[1:15:49] them for these people to go for the day
[1:15:50] for him did he take a course
[1:15:53] he said
[1:15:54] you know I'm kind of shocking to him you
[1:15:56] know
[1:15:57] I said you don't understand
[1:16:00] I said if all these people that goes to
[1:16:02] Dave Ramsey learns how to handle money
[1:16:05] and they learn how to save it and make
[1:16:07] it I get 10 percent
[1:16:11] it's a pretty good investment he said
[1:16:13] you're a wise man
[1:16:18] you know no that's being a Christian if
[1:16:23] I can't we be just that's right men be
[1:16:26] men and women be women that's right I
[1:16:28] made that statement many years ago and
[1:16:30] was ridiculed I said when the men act
[1:16:32] like men and women act like
[1:16:34] we'll be closer to adoption than you
[1:16:36] think
[1:16:37] the brother went off and told his
[1:16:39] brother Dale believe he's living right
[1:16:40] be in adoption I didn't say that
[1:16:43] I said what I meant we'd be closer yeah
[1:16:47] okay do the right way that's right that
[1:16:50] would be understanding I'm not picking
[1:16:52] on women just because of that because
[1:16:54] remember we're all feminist in the body
[1:16:55] of Christ
[1:16:58] so what is said about the women that
[1:16:59] also said about the men
[1:17:02] comes their feminist in the body of
[1:17:04] Christ amen why don't we want to live
[1:17:06] and do right in God
[1:17:08] is it a hard thing
[1:17:12] that's right but one live right on the
[1:17:14] brink
[1:17:16] you know
[1:17:18] from the edge of the fence you know you
[1:17:20] want to sit right there and
[1:17:22] one live right there
[1:17:24] and sisters just dress wrong you know
[1:17:27] around and go and
[1:17:28] doing and cutting your hair or something
[1:17:30] why you want to live right on that edge
[1:17:36] that's what I told you
[1:17:37] and you know it's true
[1:17:40] even you girls you live good and
[1:17:42] honorable lives at school
[1:17:45] oh yeah you think everybody there makes
[1:17:48] fun of you
[1:17:49] but you watch who the boys come to when
[1:17:51] they want to pick a wife that's right
[1:17:53] and you watch who the girls come to that
[1:17:55] needs help
[1:17:56] in their lives they'll come to you first
[1:18:00] that's right
[1:18:04] they'll come to you first
[1:18:07] because they know what it is
[1:18:10] and the world knows what it is
[1:18:12] but what are we doing
[1:18:15] okay
[1:18:16] on these things
[1:18:20] hard title I guess I never could get it
[1:18:22] down just exactly right what even to
[1:18:24] call it but we just called it the fact
[1:18:26] of
[1:18:27] knowing the truth and
[1:18:29] wouldn't walk in it
[1:18:36] this afternoon we're gonna have it next
[1:18:38] Sunday because we were having the the
[1:18:40] wedding vows and I didn't know I thought
[1:18:42] maybe we might be did many more might go
[1:18:44] through what Joy just you know excited
[1:18:46] we did to go over the next week after
[1:18:48] the children you got another week of
[1:18:50] practice because it's going to put your
[1:18:52] singing over and over next week and uh
[1:18:55] if we can all get a hold of brother
[1:18:57] Chris and
[1:18:58] twist his arm and break his neck maybe
[1:19:01] he'll sing for him
[1:19:03] yeah we can't break anymore
[1:19:12] I've even told him I said we'll let you
[1:19:15] sit behind the pool here where nobody
