jesus christ we pray amen amen amen mark chapter 7 we're going to get at verse 5 and it says then the pharisees and scribe asked him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashing hands he answered and said unto them well has elias says prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men for laying aside the commandment of god you hold the addition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things you do and he said unto them full well you reject the commandment of god that you may keep your own tradition for moses said honor thy father and thy mother and whosoever curseth father or mother let him die of the death but ye say if a man shall say to his father or mother it is corbin that is to say a gift but whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me he shall be free and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother making the word of god of none effect through your tradition which ye may that ye have delivered and many such like things do ye and unto and when he had called all the people unto him he said unto them hearken unto me every one of you and understand there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but the things which come out of him those are they that defile the man if any man have ears to hear let him hear amen amen god bless you night you may be seated have a have a little odd title tonight entitled this the legend of the word and the the dictionary list the word legend as a non-historical or unverifiable story handed down by tradition from earlier times and popularly accepted as historical it also means the body of stories of this kind especially as they relate to a particular person group or clan or it also means a person who is the center of such stories so when we look at the word the word legend and and speaking of this you know jesus was speaking to them of their their tradition of the scripture because when they when they saw the when these the pharisees saw the disciples and he said you know they didn't follow the the law as it was handed down which was not what moses gave them but it was added on to it was the tradition of the the elders that they done these things and he said why is it they don't follow this tradition you know brother branham said he said that one of the things that was about the the pharisees he said they were very zealous of their creed he said they were very zealous of their tradition and you know when we when we look at uh people that they get so wrapped up in tradition of things and you know just like you know people they they have these um these stories in their families and you know one of the one of the things that you hear a lot of people talk about a lot in in the world is you know you'll hear people that talk about well i i got so much of uh of this uh bro uh group or you know a lot of people say well i'm i got so much american indian in me you know i got so much cherokee in me and i've got this and i've got that and you know but now in the time that we live today people do dna tests and as they begin to do these dna tests it comes to find out as they do a dna test there ain't no indian in them or people have or people have a prejudice against a certain type of uh nationality and people come to find out is like this one man he didn't like french people you know he just had this thing about the french he didn't well he come to find out when he done his dna test he was like eight to ten percent french well you know and it's so funny because you get wrapped up in these things and people have prejudices and and all these things and come to find out you know we're in that boat and just like just like the pharisees you know here they are they're so wrapped up in this tradition that they believe this tradition is the word and they hold to this but then when the when when jesus come to speak to them of the word then they couldn't receive it because they were so bound by their tradition that he said he said you teach for the commandment of god the tradition of men he said here you are treated taking these things and he said you know you're so zealous of these things but when somebody comes to bring you the truth he said you can't see what the truth is you can't see what how the how the word of god is because you know as jesus told them and so many times you know he began to express to them who he was you know his head was to identify who he was because you know all the way because they so many times the pharisees stood up and said you know our our father is abraham and moses brought us the law and all these different things but then when jesus turned around and brought the law back to them to show them what the truth was then they couldn't they couldn't stand with it and they hated him so much that they were willing to kill him because they couldn't stand with the word but you know they wanted to hold to a tradition they had their own idea of how things were supposed to be you know brother brown talked about how you know how the uh when the messiah was supposed to come you know here here they are when when when the law came and it was supposed to have the messiah come well you know all the all that the jews looked at when they when they saw the messiah when they read the old when they wrote the old testament they read the law when they began to look at what the uh old testament was to what the messiah was supposed to be all they could see was a ruler coming in power and glory that's all they could see was that he was supposed to take over and rule the nations but they couldn't see that he was supposed to come as a lamb he was supposed to come as a babe that was supposed to come as a sacrifice as a gift but they couldn't see that all they could see was the the rulership that was coming they were coming to see the dominion that was going to take place and yet when they began to see and even when they prophesied of john coming and when there was supposed to be a messenger come before my face when he was supposed to come they couldn't see that because it was supposed to be these great things that were supposed to take place and yet they missed it why because they didn't see it because their their idea of what was great was not god's idea what was great so they didn't come the way that god that they got because what they thought was great god's called foolish he know well you know this is this is not the way it comes but he wanted to come in in humbleness and and simplicity but they missed it when they come that way and you know they say but we we have to see how god has to come and that's the way god works is to be coming in simplicity and and humbleness and they miss these things because you know they wanted all the pomp and circumstance and all the different things that that they call for that you know that's the way that they lived their lives why because they wanted somebody to look at them they wanted somebody to notice them and you know that wasn't that wasn't the idea that jesus had but he come to be a servant that's right amen and you know here they hear they come you know they were looking for something that something great was going to take place but yet when when jehovah came jehovah came and he was born over a manure pile right that's right when he come he he was born low and nobody nobody had any time for him when he began and he began to express even even when you go back and hear hear these disciples and even herod and all the different ones here they are but here here's the every time god is not without a witness god always has a witness to what's taking place because even even when when here come here come mary and she began to speak of these things and you know here she was she held it within her heart but you know she nobody wanted to believe that mary was the one why because there was so many that were better educated that come from better backgrounds had had better prestige in their family and it all automatically it would have had to be one of them that god would have called that would have had the virgin to conceive it would have had to be one of them who would have been the high priest daughter or somebody else that was fancy or whatever but it couldn't have been some lowly woman like mary why because she didn't have the pedigree that we expected that's right right brother and then when even when she did rest you know conceived then everybody was like well you need to stay away from her because you know because they did not even believe that it was her and you stay away from her because you know she's a bad she's a woman of ill repute yeah she's not any woman to have anything to do with but they missed god in everything but when it when he came even even here that here they are in this situation and you know they begin to speak and nobody wants you know so many that didn't believe that yet here come the wise men hear these wise men come from far away and begin to begin to speak and say where is he that was born king of the jews because even when the shepherds came from the field because the angels had come and announced the birth of jesus they came in and said you know we have heard because the angels in the heavenly host have spoken to us and here we are to come and worship the one that was spoken of of the scripture but you know most people still didn't believe that because they thought well that's just a bunch of old cranks coming out of the field but they didn't realize that they had had an angelic visitation in their day but nobody believed that but you know those men stood up and they were a witness to that day and then when the wise men came and those men had watched all those years and seen what was going to take place why because that had been written in the scripture been written in the sky and those men had studied all their lives to know what the scripture said why because he wrote this walk the bible in the heaven so when the commons began to speak they knew what was taking place so when they began that journey they knew where they were going and who they were going to meet and when he began to speak to them on that day yet they didn't see that they didn't they didn't recognize that he was there in their midst where is he that's born king of the jews where is he here he is that they came to look and they offered gold frankincense and mirror speaking of who he was and people still didn't see it and even when mary began to bring him into the temple that day to have him circumcised and we know that simeon the lord had spoke to simeon and told him what was going to take place and yet nobody believed it nobody believed that when it had taken place here with simeon's talent said i'll not depart until i see the lord's christ and then he stood and took the child and he said you know now your servant can depart in peace for my eyes have seen the salvation amen right and then the prophet the prophetess anna began to speak and speak of what was going to take place and prophesy over his life and people still didn't see what was taking place and there he was in the midst and so here he is when he began to speak the whole time his whole life was was the fulfillment of the word but yeah they they held on to their tradition they held on to their own concept of what the scripture said and he stood there and he told them he said search the scriptures while we kept taking them back to the scripture to show them he said he said in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me show me where i have failed the word all right right but yet they didn't still didn't see who he was but we just want to hold on to our idea of the word many people just holding on well this is what this is what mama said about it this is what daddy said about it is what the preacher said about it that's what greer's almanac says about it but they don't but they don't go try to find out for themselves why because they don't want to have they don't they don't take the time to come and get an experience for themselves why because if you've not had an experience you're not going to know these things it takes an experience of the baptism of the holy ghost it has a new birth and without that you'll never get anywhere all the way through the scripture that's what what has happened see god god comes so simple it was missed yes even from the beginning satan satan's always got his work and he always tries to make something better brother abraham said that you know what he's talking about eve when he began to speak to eve when the serpent began to speak to evil into something that was great or something bigger something more wonderful and she missed that he was hebrews 13 8 amen that it was the simplest thing it was so simple and that's what god wanted us to see that it was just so simple but you know that's what that's what we have to see that is it's so simple and it takes it takes not our sight but it takes his side we have to have his eyesight to see these things because we can't see them in ourselves many times we miss those things all the way through the scriptures when they begin to speak and jesus had to turn back around and speak to them and tell him these are the things that's taken place when he began to speak to him about john c they kept looking for elijah and he told them look elijah's already come right when he began to expel express that to him oh that was john well they missed it well you know the same thing in our day many times people have read the scripture they've looked at the scriptures they've read the books they've listened to the tapes but you know if it doesn't take if it's not the holy ghost that comes to you to quicken it to you then people miss it it takes the holy ghost that's right we have brother brahm talked about he said we have a map he talks about this is from the message god has provided as a provided way and he's talking about the highways he said you know the highway department has has maps and it has all these little things along the way he said has he has a highway provided you just follow the highway get them out follow the highway it's very easy to go anywhere in the united states just by getting a highway map he said god has a map marked for your healing for salvation and a mountain marked for glory it all leads that way and while we're traveling this grand ole highway if we need a place for healing you'll notice on the map there's a little there's little stations all along the side of the road where the lord has provided for us a healing place he has ministers all down along the road and he that that believes in divine healing and they pray for the sick and needy and then brother brown continues on about uh the the good samaritan you know helping the man to the to the end and help pay for him and bind him up with everything he says but he said but when you become a believer then all these things shed off and it's a new life of belief and it produces righteousness peace joy love long suffering goodness patience gentleness that's the attributes because you're a believer now god he said did you ever stop to think now just a little bit that let's just look straight at the scripture and i love it because it's god's pathway it's god's righteousness and all these things that happened back in the old testament was an example of what we can be if we take the same thing or the road that they did so we go back and we look so i want to i want to look at two things here tonight because you know there's a legend of of the stories and and just you know seeing these things as stories and you know um these people that that people put up on pedestals and you know brother i'm talking about william tale you know he shot an apple off the man's head till he went overseas and realized that never happened and you know everybody you know brother brown said we uh the world know all the kids they all they all know about davey crockett and all these people and you know and he said you know they you know all the great stories that they told about daniel boone and all of them and half of them are not true but you know they were so wrapped up he said they don't know who jesus christ is but he said they knew all about these legends and stories but the thing is is you know people people look and see well that's just a story you know it was just something mama told me that's something granny told me but the thing is is you know it's got to be a truth to you it's got to be something that's real to you it can't be just a story it just can't be a fable because like peter said he said we've not been we've not been led by cunningly devised fables but he said we were eyewitnesses to these states so we when we take these things you know it just can't be a legend as a story or anything but the thing is it does have to be a legend to you and i don't know if y'all if y'all know this or not but there's another word for the for legend the word legend also means a table or a map chart or the like listening explaining the symbols used he says he said it also means like the word key also fits in this a systematic explanation of abbreviation symbols and such using dictionaries maps and everything like that so there is a legend that can be used but it's not the legend where you think that you know it's just a fable or just some story but you actually read those things because what brother ram said he said these were examples to us because it unlocks the truth to us so it shows us the truth and the death shows us the day and hour that which we live but you know that's the reason when we go back to the scripture and we're looking to see the day and hour which we live when god looks and to our day when we see the things that took place what he had to take had to do because of the scripture that what the scripture told us would take place then we realized we had to have a prophet in our day we had to have because all the way through the scriptures he had he had prophets that came he had messengers that came and the one thing that they done was they always identified the error of the day and they brought the truth for their day so there had to be somebody in our day why because it was the same all the way down through history people looking and saying well you know this is what mama said is what daddy said this is what all these different people said but yet when we go back and look you know we we have to apply this to ourselves and it has to be a personal relationship with us we have to see it as a personal experience but when we take these things and it's not what somebody else said but when we begin to look into the scripture and you begin to read it for yourself and you wait for the lord to come to speak to you then he shows you things along the way and some things will pique your interest and you'll say why did he say that when he said that then all of a sudden then you begin to search for the answer they had a question and all of a sudden you'll find out why is it why is it that when people catch things and they say well they don't make sense right there's people that read in the scripture and they say here's matthew 28 19 there's acts 2 38. why is that well i don't make any sense or people stand there and now listen to somebody argue trinity and one god and they'll say well one scripture say this and one scripture says that and they wonder why what's the deal well god's not an author of confusion exactly so then here they are they're arguing over these things well so then all of a sudden they begin to search these things and then people people have simple questions like why did god use angels in the old testament but he didn't use angels today well if he's the same if he speaks why did he use angels then but not now so there's so many questions that people catch all of us and why because people are looking for themselves but see if you're so bound by your tradition just like just like when when jesus held the healed the blind man you know his his mom and dad you know they didn't want it he's of age let him answer we know we're not getting involved in this why because they were so bound by their tradition why because they were so bound by a system that they weren't going to we're not getting involved in this why because we we don't want to rock the boat we don't want to stir no water we don't do nothing because we're just going to flow along why because we don't want to be kicked out but you know if if they had actually sat down and began to look at what the scripture had to say and took for themselves then they would say well you know this is what the bible says amen who would who could who could heal but god amen is there is there any place because the scripture the old testament even psalms and all this all the throughout the old testament the law tells us all the word tells us that only god can heal well a miracle took place in our midst then who done it well they weren't going to challenge they weren't going to challenge the pharisees on that why because it was something but you know he stood up and said hey you know what i was blind and now i see and he said i don't know who it was but he said i know who spoke to me and he told me he said i could receive my sight now he said i did i believe what he had to say and i received my sight he said well if y'all are supposed to be so religious and you're supposed to be the greatest the great religious leaders of our days and why don't you know who he is why are you asking me because if you're supposed to be the ones that god talks to you're supposed to be the the one that's the extension of god on the earth so why don't you know who he is why is it why is it that i'm the one that's trying to tell you well you can't listen to him because he's he's he's got a devil well he's got enough of god to do miracles but if you're so if you're so anointed if you have so much then why can't you do it right why can't you do these things but you know here so you know he took what what he hadn't because he believed what what happened and he said well these are the things that i know what took place and so as jesus began to do these miracles he began to show who he was and he began to speak to different people and then they had a witness of who he was one because they had an experience with him so when they began to speak to these things they stood up and they began to speak of their experience and so you and i we have to have the same experience you know we have to stand up and and declare what our what our experience is what god has done for what we have seen in our day one because there's so many people that's out there that's either wishy-washy or they have turned and completely walked away but you know what god has called us to be eyewitnesses of these things he has called us to be representatives of this message in this hour to stand up and claim what god has done for us we're not we're not we're not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ i'm not ashamed of the gospel that has been brought i'm not ashamed to stand up and say that my prophet is brother branham william because you know what because i begin to look in the scripture and i begin to see who i am and i can see where i'm standing and you know what came through or came forth from this from the scripture so i know what was said so i can stand behind that and have confidence in what god said well nobody else is going to be able to tell me out of why because they didn't talk me into it i'm not i'm not ashamed of it and you you know just like brother brown i'm talking about you you try to talk to some people and you can't you can't help some people you know he was talking about the doctor and he said you know here here comes here comes a man that's sick and he needs something oh yeah and he you know he comes oh doctor i'm so sick he said what's wrong he said he said when was the last time he ate he said well i ate half a cracker the day before yesterday he's like well what's your problem is you're hungry you're not going to make it unless you eat so what what what is the prescription the prescription is to eat right right and just just like just like you talked about the the doctor the man come to the doctor he's like well i'm sick i need something he's like well you know he said right inside here is the medicine well he can sit on the man he said on the doctor's doorstep and die he gets so close but he can't get all the way he can only get so far but he's not went in all the way to the place but you know the doctor can stand on the doorstep have the door open but until that man decides that he's going to come in and receive then you know he can't do anything for him why because in our day many times people the door has been opened well because not only because we have received the word in our day we have received a key and just like brother i'm talking about then the key to the door you know the door is there and you've been given the key he said the scriptural key he said it's the key of faith he said you got to go and unlock the door but the door is before you but you've been given the access to it but the problem is you've got to go you can't wait for somebody else to do it for you you've been given the opportunity god has called us into a a place god wants us to receive what god has for us but you know we've got we've got to do what god wants us to do to do that you know i was thinking about brother brother altic the last time he was here and and yet you know he was talking about the about manna you know many people talk you know when you're talking about having a need and and you know people you know his brother i'm talking about the man you know he needed to eat he was he was starving to death that was his whole problem but you know there was the talk about the uh the children of israel when when god rained down manna for him you know he he give them he give them exactly what they had need of sure but you know what people didn't like it right you know his brother brother oltek was talking about you know when when the matter came you know he said it was divine and somebody it was divine in origin but the problem was is when people got it you know they want to argue you know they want to examine this right yeah and by their own tradition their own idea well you know i don't think god would do it that way now why would god you said that it rained down from heaven then why did it then why'd god let it pass away if it was divine then why didn't it stay amen here it was that you know it came down and then if you just left it and you didn't go get it then it disappeared well i don't think god would do it that way well that's that's that's just doesn't just make any sense to me well it's not supposed to make sense to you because you're trying to use a finite mind to understand an infinite god so when when the when the word came why because it was a daily gathering of the food so it's just a type of type of a spiritual walk you can't you can't just rely on yesterday's experience you can't rely on on last week's experience but it has to be a daily experience to take place it's a daily eating of the word and so when he said you know they come out there and they gathered that food well if they followed god's plan it had nutritional value to it they fed and he said he said they didn't get weak they didn't get old everything that they had need of was in that all right so they were perfectly healthy and whole by eating what they had because god gave it to them but you know if they didn't go out there and get it there was nothing for them and the other thing is is if you tried to hold that over you couldn't hold that over until because it didn't become spoiled and so you could only accept the what the food that god had given the manna that had been given in a specified time in a specified way because you couldn't do it any way you wanted to you had to do it the way god said do it amen except for except when he told him he said you got to go out and get a double portion yeah because the sabbath was coming on and they had to go get a double portion well then that stayed but you know you couldn't hold that beyond a certain period of time right so here it was they were able to gather the metal but they had to gather it when god told them to but there was one time that the manna never failed it never ruined when god told them he said now listen he said you go and gather the manna and you got this omer of manna and he said you go take it into the holy of holies here's here's a gathering of this and it's set up in the holy place and then when it was there then he said when the new priest came in he said they were invited and they had a right to taste the manna that fell in the wilderness and it never ruined and so see there was a specified time when god had all this laid out and so you know we have been given as brother oltek said we've been given a seed in our day we've been given a word in our day and he said it's the message of the hour and so when we receive this message then we can eat on it any time we want to amen we have a message that we can feed on all the time why because we can we can read and we can listen to it all the time it's it's available but the problem is is and then we can we can we can sustain our life through that but the problem is is when we get outside of god's plan then it has no nutritional value to us when there's only one thing see when you get beyond using when you begin to use this manner when you begin to use this manner in a way that god didn't prescribe to use it when he said when we want to take tapes and we want to bypass a five-fold ministry then all of a sudden then you're ruining the nutritional value of the manna because god didn't plant it that way and you you can't have a christian walk you can't be strengthened you can't go in this journey if you're not going to follow it the way god gave the man just like they had to follow the manna the way god prescribed it in the old testament and the same way today we have to follow the way god gave us the word exactly what god gave us in this hour if you're going to make a rapture if you're going to make a body change then it has to come the same way because there's no way that you're going to live on wiggle tells and make it all right why because god gave us away he gave us he gave us a plan on what to follow but the thing is is you've got to believe that that's what god gave you you've got to see it as yours many people just want to walk and they just see it as a tradition yeah that's right i don't see it as a tradition i see i see it as a way that all of a sudden because many times we read the scripture when we see these things that many people have probed in the scripture and they've looked at things in the scripture and they've not understood them and people come up with all kinds of ideas and everything but you know what it took god coming why because he promised that he would come through through malachi 4 that he would come and bring a prophet that he would come and all these things all the way down through time they had they had truth there was truth all the way down through time every every one of the other messengers all every church age had their truth why because he said they had a he said they had a chance had a revival he said a chance at the word so each each age had a word each age had a revival but the problem is in our day and then it was the bringing is the culmination of all these things not because all the things that took place in the past now it's come to our day to see the fulfillment of these things to see the fullness of god's plan to realize that god what god has done all the way down through time why because in the in the past they didn't understand these things they didn't understand them in the old testament but when john began to express who jesus was and began to express what was going to take place then when jesus came on the scene then he could stand there and look back and he could tell everything that isaiah and jeremiah and ezekiel and all the rest of them had said was exactly the fulfillment of what the day was but they didn't see it why because it didn't look the way it should have looked to them yeah that's right that's right and say it's the same way today we don't we don't see why because you know we don't expect to look the way it does or things haven't happened the way it would think it ought to happen and you know if god was on the move things would be better or you know all these different things but you know we understand it in this day we know it's going to be a battle it's going to be hard it's going to be why because the greatest battle ever fought was in the mind and everything that you have have a preconceived idea the devil's going to shoot you full of something to try to hinder you to hold you back to quote for you to question everything along the way we're going to have to fight all those different things why because it's not going to it's because you know we're human beings we're going to see certain things a certain way we're going to wish things come a certain way we're looking at things and hoping things would happen this way but it's not and many times many things come our way and we wonder why why it came this way and why has it happened or happened to me this way and why is it so so bad looking why is it why is all these things why because god is molding us we know these things are going to take place we know we got to face these things why because you know what but you know no matter what the devil brings our way whatever god allows us to come whatever comes our way you know more than conquerors through him that loved us but whatever comes our way we're overcoming we can overcome these things why because he said that there would be a bride that wouldn't fall i'm so glad see it's not it's not me i can't i can't do it in myself i can't i can't do it but i know that he has right and he takes the word and it takes the word he takes a revelation of the word for him to to reveal the word to us and if we receive the revelation of the word then we can see what god has done for us message this is the key to the door brother rem says he said therefore i believe in the full gospel every word of god that turns the power of god loose that turns his blessings to the people it's the key to the door that unlocks it all those great heroes those prophets and great men of the bible they had that key that's the reason they could stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword bring back bring the dead back to life again and do all kinds of miracles is because they held that key they knowed it worked because it was a scripture-born key he said if i'm programming with a creed key i don't know what's going what it's going to do he says they say my church speaks this i don't know about that but when the bible teaches it and i hold the key the faith key in my hand or in my heart that says that's god's words that'll quench the violence of fire it'll unlock healing for the sick it'll unlock salvation to the lost i have to come to the door everything's in his name whatsoever you do and word or deed do all in his name knowing that the key that you got is faith because it's a scripture made key and if it's a creed's key a denominational key i don't know what it'll do but if it's a scriptural key it'll unlock because god said so right oh no no wonder they could stop the violence of fire and so forth they had the key so we've received the key because we've received the message and so the key that we received or we've ex we've received this this past this legend that we can understand what the scripture has to say so there's a way to unlock these things because you know many people you know they got a map and they pull out the map and they're looking at the map and they're saying well this is what god said but then when you start to try to figure out how to get somewhere they don't know how to get there you know it's just like somebody pulling out a map and and looking at it and it's like we know where we're supposed to be well i don't know how do we how do we define where we're at yeah and then and then when they start looking oh well here's here's the here's a spot on the map and it and it says this this is lula it's like okay so where do we need to go from here it's like well you follow the blue road up here and then the red road goes off to the left yeah and it's like well how do you where's there's no road that's blue but they're looking but they're looking at the mouth well i'm reading you i'm telling you what the map says but there's no way to see that until until you have a way to identify what's in the map until you identify what's in the word then you don't have any idea what it says and so many people get up and you know one person gets up and and they say well you know uh you know i i wish i wish that they they believed in uh you know healing i i know i know you know it says that but you know i just i just don't know if if that actually works and it's like well you know i've never seen anybody get healed and you know you know the bible tells me you know and i hear and i hear and i've seen it in the bible people talk about it they say you know if you want to get blessed he said he said if you would if you'd bring your ties into the storehouse he said you know if you'd pay tithing then you know god said he'd bless you and you know people well i don't know anything about that and so so the so they they see these things until somebody comes along and begins to speak just like that ethiopian eunuch you know he was standing there and he was speaking he's like uh is he speaking of himself or somebody else well somebody that had an experience and knew what was then he began to take the scripture and begin to express salvation to him or who jesus christ was and what jesus christ came to do right amen and many people they they've heard these things that are in the scripture but you know they're looking for somebody to manifest it too i know what it's like i know what it's like to be lost i know what it's like to be found i know what it's like to be blessed i know what it's like to be healed i know what god has done for me i know where god's brought me i can tell you what and so when people begin to say well i don't know about these things well let me tell you something let me let me tell you share your something with you come on and sometimes that's what god wants us why because people have heard a lot of things and you know but they've not seen the truth right and as brother ram said there's a lot of mockery there's a lot of uh fake so so we see a lot see a lot of things that are that are not true and people get get uh discouraged they get hindered by these things and they say well i wish i knew somebody that was that where it was true this these things had actually taken place so when we not not only do we have it's not just a standing up and describing something or telling something but it's for us to be so filled with of the spirit you know when you begin to live the life in front of somebody that you know when somebody because there's a lot of people they don't they don't care they they they just walk around with blinders on it doesn't it doesn't affect some people you know because the the the life of jesus christ they're not looking for it but you know there's some out there that are looking they are seeking that you know because people say you know where is it where is god you know where is where is it where the like it says in the scripture just like just like brother talk about that that man somebody you know they were looking for a christian they said well i'll show you a christian let's go home i'll show you my wife he's like well you know they thought they had some well we we mom and daddy talked about all this and you know we've sat in a church and we've heard the preacher preach we've seen a lot of things but you know what we've never seen a lot the life of jesus christ made manifest we've never seen it take place i've never had an experience with it but all of a sudden when they came to that place then you know what it become a time when they went in there you know he they all acted drunk and you know acted the way they did you know she he threw all his stuff on the floor and you know he said just watch this and they went outside and she was in there singing and cleaning that mess and they began to see the life of jesus christ made manifest in her it's like you know what that's a real christian amen when you when somebody's looking for something and they see that they see somebody's life it's it's not it's not that you try to preach somebody a sermon is so that you live somebody a sermon can you lift somebody a sermon can you live something before somebody and you know and then let us let us be so molded into his character into his image that the world can see i want to show the world that he lives not not just that that we talk about it i want to i want to show the world that he lives that he is he is here today the same as he was back then to do the same thing but many people are they question these things and they say well you know what i've heard these things and i've seen things but you know if you can show somebody brother brown said just be salty let's be salty he said if we'd be salty he said you know he said then you know they'll get a thirst one because they'll see something that's true god god has revealed this message to us that we may spread the light to the world that shows these things and i believe that you know we have received the truth in our day we've received the life the light has come from the from the messenger because i believe it was scripturally vindicated this word was scripturally vindicated to show us who who brother branham was the lord and it's not it's not making brother branham anything that's right right no but it's identifying the word what the scripture says it doesn't make you and i anything but it identifies what the scripture says it identifies him in the word that jesus is the same and when we see that the messenger has come then he said he said it spread the light he said brother brown said in the in the smyrna church age he said in every age we have exactly the same pattern that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area he said then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been faithfully taught that's right so that's the reason why it's so important to have a pastor why because you've got to be taught absolutely why because it has it has to be taught to us because that's way that's the way it comes because he told it it would come through a five-fold ministry for the perfecting of the saints so when we have to say we have to have those that have been faithfully taught there is a ministry and everybody says well it's just one ministry well we're just looking at brother brandon well he said there would be other ministries that were faithfully told that would do the exact same thing in every age when he began to speak of the uh the the voice of many waters he said he said it's the voice of the ministers in every age so then there has to be a fivefold ministry that has been faithfully told under the prophet's message that she that this fivefold ministry began to sound and then through the 5-0 ministry as the hey begins as they begin to sound then the work we're not doing away with what the prophet had to say why because you still receive from the message but see it also has to come through the five-fold ministry through the perfecting that you begin to sound also that you begin to show forth the word that you begin to speak also it's not just the well because everybody says well we know what brother branham is and we and you know we know the five-fold ministry and we'd say well you know i've got behind my pastor brother dale and i'm just going to stay right here come on well god didn't call you just to stay right there all right well because we have to go on from here we've got to go on so there's a call not just to stay in one spot and say well you know i've reached it god didn't god didn't call us to lula god called us to the word god called us to the word he didn't call us he didn't call us to be lulaites he called us to the word he called us to be christian he called us to be the bride of jesus christ amen so we've received these we received the word in our day amen and the word is to be we're brother rem said that he said we have been invited to be molded into his image we have been invited absolutely you know god's a gentleman so we've been given this that we can receive the word amen and follow what god has has for us what god has for us brother brown says in here in the smyrna church age he said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches of every age he said in every age it was the same cry hear what the spirit says if you're a christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word of this age every messenger to every age will preach that word every fresh and true revival will be because men it's the very last one brother if i've got it because men have gotten back to the word for their age the cry of every age is the rebuke you have left the word of god repent and come back to the word for for the from the first book in the bible genesis to the last book revelation there is only one reason for god's displeasure leaving the word and there is only one remedy to regain his favor back to the word amen let's come back to the word many times people say well brother brother aaron i i'm in the word yeah but you know things aren't the way they used to be we need it's high time we check and see why exactly that's right you know if you feel if you feel cold in the lord and you wonder why the lord don't speak to you the way he used to like that old saying is is you can guarantee who the one that moved yes because god didn't move you'll know that you were the one that left right and then go back to find where he's at you've you've left your first love that's right you've left the word let's go back to the word let's find our place and let us lord let us just be what you'd have us to be less let's be on fire let's move forward right now i want i want because god has brought something that no it's so amazing but what god has brought to us in our day god has brought us the word amen right all the things that people have probed at and questioned and all these things and and people are leaving the message because they stand there and they say well you know we've stood around all this time and we've listened to this and we've listened to that and we still you know all and they got questions about this and brother brown said this and their brother around said that that's right well the problem is is they don't have the key it's just been fables to them it's just been words to me but you know what brothers sisters we have the opportunity to have the one that wrote this scripture come and uh reveal the word to us so is a legend why because the scripture has been laid here the scripture didn't change all through all through history the scripture didn't change but it took somebody with supernatural vision that could hear from god that he could speak that's right and when he began to hear from god he began to speak and he began to look into the scripture and he began to bring these things out and show the truth of what was what was written in there yeah and as it began then it became a brand new book it wasn't it wasn't just denominational guesswork it just wasn't some idea from man like well you better leave that book of revelation alone no no god has begun to reveal these things you know is god coming on a white cloud he's coming on a white horse you know is god going to do this or god going to do that how's how's all these things going to take place you know why why is there three and a half years or is there seven all these different things there are all these different questions that people have they said well brother brown said this brother said that well the problem is is you've got to get in the same spirit that he was in that's right and to see you know so many times people people get so hung up on things and you know then then they they try to they try to solve it themselves or they try to move forward or whatever you know stand still and know that he is god so well i don't understand this it may be years but you know the thing is is god wants you to keep walking when god told abraham hey listen you're going to have a son he said i'm going to visit you according to the time of life well when god told him that when god stood out there and told him said can you count the stars can you count the sand he said that's how your seed's going to be here's a man that's you know so advanced in age his body's failing him how is he going to do that but you know what he didn't he didn't tell him how everything was going to take place now that's what's going to happen you're going you're going to do this and you're going to go over here and then when this happens you're going to do that and then you know you're going to try to give your wife away and then this is going to happen and that's going to happen and you know all these different things god didn't tell him that but he told him to walk by faith he said walk in the land exactly walk in the land amen god didn't tell him that every little hiccup in the plan was going to be right even when god told him said depart from your family and go to a place that i'll show you that's right you know god didn't run out there and stop him say right i told you to go yeah that's right you got that fellow over here a lot you got to get rid of him no he let him go yeah absolutely but in time you know because god told him said listen you get away from your family and you go to the place it was a journey of him and god amen and when lot came along then you know what there was strife that built up and you know they had to go separate why because god that's what god told him to do in the first place to go your own way to go away not bring anybody else but as he began to walk then the more that he began to walk in the land as he began to journey and along the way then god began to speak to him some more and began to show him more things of what was going to take place but he didn't show him everything that was going to take place so as he began to walk and he began to see more things and he began to walk then he began to see more things and then god began to speak to him more yeah well you know what they didn't they didn't stop well you know what god's speaking to me all the time now i'm walking and you know what i don't i don't i don't see it anymore no he was still sinning as long as you're in this journey guess what you're gonna do the same thing and many times people people get they they'll get upset about things and and then you know some people some people get so condemned that they won't go any further why because they allow condemnation to hold them back it's like well i'm stuck well i don't know what i don't want to do now well god trying to talk to you well you know we get so we get so tired we can't listen to god speak because you know why because we're so tied up in our condemnation that's right just like lazarus we're wrapped up in grape clothes we're all bound up we're bound up in condemnation but you know what god's made a way and god begins to speak to you don't allow your condemnation to hold you back you know god don't god don't just overlook our sin but god will make an avenue for you to come back god will speak to you for you to come to him amen but it takes you to make that journey many people they get so bound by things that things that have happened and things in the past and they get so they get so worried or whatever they get so bound up with things it's time god's making an avenue he's calling for you to come out of that don't allow those things to hold you back and as abraham began to walk then god began to speak to him and as he began to speak to him then you know he reached a place where he had a body change even even then he didn't he didn't do everything right but you know what something took place and he began to walk he began to see that his old sins had been cast off he began to walk in newness of life it didn't make him perfect but you know what he began to walk in the word that god had given him see the thing is you and i we're not perfect but we have a perfect god we have a perfect sacrifice see god don't see us the way we see ourselves see we can begin to look at ourselves in the word why because he's unlocked the word for us to see who we are not to see ourselves when you begin to stand up and you and you begin to see that my sins are gone god took my sins and he placed them in the sea in the depths of the sea and the sea of god's forgetfulness he said never to be remembered again now you can remember your sins and everybody else can remember your sins and everything but thank god god don't remember our sins anymore god has brought us from that place so you know what there is no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus one because god is showing us that we are free from that to walk in newness to to walk from that the thing is is when we come to true repentance and we see these things and they drop off then we just continue on well we still carry things and we still battle these things but you know what god doesn't see us i want to walk the way god sees me the word through the light of the world that's what i want to see amen god bless you not let's all stand have the musicians come i want to sing that song we'll walk in the light the beautiful light why because we've received the word in our day and now it's time to walk in the light the light of that word why because now the word has been illuminated amen and if the word has been lightened to us that we can see then we'll walk in that light just just walk just like the brother i'm talking about that man and he said well you know he told brother brandon he said you know i don't agree with everything that you preached and everything he said well brother where do you live he said well i live up over the mountain he said how you getting home he said this path i'm on he said well he said can you see your house in there nope can't see it he said well how do you get there he said i'm on this trail but he said how you can't see the rest of that trail you don't see this part right here he said but i got a light he said this light is going to light the path i don't see all the way but i know it's there but i'm going to walk in the light that's shining before me and he told that brother he said well brother that's what we do we walk in the light the light that god shows us we walk in that light we may not see everything we may not see the end of it but you know we walk in the light that god shows us 142 in the spiral book all ye saints of light proclaim [Music] jesus life and mercy in his name [Music] jesus [Music] shine all around us [Music] hear the savior's [Music] jesus [Music] jesus

equipped us to do that also you know i think brother brown talking about that his mom believed his mom had that dream about that woman wanting to walk on that on that highway you know had to come up those steps onto that highway to to walk and he told her said sister you can't walk that way [Music] so i can do it nope you're not equipped for it said you got those wrong shoes on said you ain't got no shoes walking to walk this road and she began to thought well i can do it but you know he said after she got up that road a certain way she realized she couldn't make it she fell off he said you know that awful screaming he said but you know he said if you were equipped to walk that you know god had a way he said but you got to come up those steps justification saints vacation the baptism the holy ghost puts you on that amen so there is a highway made for the wayfarer in man he said throw a fool it shall not air therein amen i'm so glad that god called us to walk in the light there's a path to walk and god will lead us that way god will know how to how to lead us that way god's equipped us to go that journey [Music] i know his spirit he speaks to me [Music] lord please come and take
