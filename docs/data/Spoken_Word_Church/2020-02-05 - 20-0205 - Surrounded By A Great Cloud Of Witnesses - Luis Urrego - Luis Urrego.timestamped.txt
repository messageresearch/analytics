[4:37] be here another day appreciate brother
[4:40] Dale allowing us to take the pulpit a
[4:43] man and justwait share something with
[4:45] you that maybe might be helpful amen
[4:47] praise the Lord I appreciate all the
[4:51] prayers for this this Sunday as we were
[4:53] ministering I appreciate it brother
[4:55] Kenneth Boone's in Greenville South
[4:57] Carolina in the morning and then at
[4:58] brother gene Williams in the afternoon
[5:01] so they all send greetings to both both
[5:05] brother Dale and brother Wade and all of
[5:07] you and also spoke briefly to brother
[5:10] Tim Burdette and he sends his greetings
[5:12] as well to Dale so we certainly had a
[5:15] good time and I appreciate all of your
[5:16] prayers amen so we're just gonna go
[5:19] ahead and go to the word and we want to
[5:22] turn to Hebrews chapter 11 hebrews
[5:25] chapter 11 we're gonna start at verse 39
[5:32] amen if you have it say Amen I know
[5:42] brother Dale he's been bringing out from
[5:44] Hebrews 11 I want to read verse 39 and
[5:46] then we're gonna agreed to the next
[5:48] chapter which is two up to verse three
[5:50] so let's just start at verse 39 and says
[5:53] and these all having obtained a good
[5:55] report through faith received not the
[5:58] promise God having provided some better
[6:01] thing for us keep that in mind that day
[6:05] without us should not be made perfect
[6:07] and then it continues right into chapter
[6:12] 12 Paul continues to say wherefore
[6:15] seeing we also are compassed about with
[6:18] so great a cloud a cloud of witnesses
[6:22] let us lay aside every weight and the
[6:26] sin which doth so easily beset us and
[6:29] let us run with patience the race that
[6:32] is set before us looking unto Jesus the
[6:36] author and finisher of our faith who for
[6:39] the joy that was set before him endured
[6:40] the cross despising the shame
[6:43] and it sat down at the right hand of the
[6:46] throne of God for consider him that
[6:49] endured such contradiction of sinners
[6:51] against himself lest you be wearied and
[6:55] faint in your minds so if that can't
[6:59] happen then Paul wouldn't have given
[7:01] that that that warning because it can
[7:04] happen
[7:05] doesn't matter how long you've been in
[7:07] the message we can get spiritually weak
[7:11] in our minds if we don't continue in the
[7:13] word amen so I want to I want to talked
[7:16] about tonight and I want to title this
[7:18] surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses
[7:21] amen so let's just bow our heads our
[7:24] Heavenly Father we thank you lord once
[7:26] again for the opportunity to open that
[7:28] back the pages of your word we ask for
[7:31] your blessing now Lord and just may you
[7:33] just meet every need amongst us father
[7:34] God as your word goes forth Lord
[7:37] minister to those needs Lord speak
[7:39] through my lips Lord and then let us
[7:41] something be said Lord that it would
[7:43] help and benefit the people and
[7:45] encourage them in their walk Lord with
[7:47] you we committed this time into your
[7:49] hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[7:52] amen
[7:53] you may be seated praise God amen hmm
[7:59] alright tonight tonight I want to I want
[8:02] to discuss I want to discuss we're gonna
[8:06] talk about a couple of things but I want
[8:08] to get the meat of it I want to I want
[8:10] to talk about this cloud and that it's
[8:13] you know it's been it's been the
[8:15] controversy of us for since it first
[8:18] came up here it's been a controversy
[8:21] brother Dale I'm sure I know that he had
[8:23] to deal it with it back in the 70s
[8:25] people misunderstanding what this what
[8:29] this is leaving the message just because
[8:32] of of what they thought you know they
[8:34] knew about the cloud but I want to tie
[8:38] it in with a couple of other things so I
[8:40] would ask you all this evening I believe
[8:42] God has something for you tonight
[8:44] so please don't fall asleep please try
[8:47] to maintain awake because I promise you
[8:50] I will get everybody to stand
[8:52] it's becoming a nice little habit here
[8:54] and I will do it too I believe God has
[8:57] something his word and it also
[8:59] encourages us because I mean we labor
[9:01] for hours taking this information and
[9:04] and when and you know if you're paying
[9:06] attention hey
[9:07] it just blesses us so man so so thank
[9:10] you very much now brother Brown says
[9:13] here in Jehovah Jireh in 1962 and I'm
[9:16] just gonna I'm gonna do a lot of reading
[9:17] so you just bear with me but if you want
[9:20] a copy of these notes or a copy of any
[9:22] of these images and things that I'm
[9:25] going to show you're more than welcome
[9:27] to it and so you you can have it you can
[9:31] have anything here about brother Branham
[9:33] says here in the 11th chapter these
[9:36] things was for our example seeing that
[9:38] where compassed about with such a great
[9:40] cloud of witnesses we are to lay aside
[9:43] every sin
[9:44] what is sin unbelief so when we were
[9:47] reading there in in that verse you know
[9:49] lay aside the sin in the easily besets
[9:52] us
[9:53] it's the unbelief amen and so when you
[9:56] have unbelief in your life and which is
[10:00] sin it's gonna cause you I mean the the
[10:03] effects of that is the smoking and the
[10:05] drinking and the gambling and the doing
[10:06] all these other things and you do all
[10:08] those things brother Branham said is
[10:09] because you don't believe truly in your
[10:12] heart you don't believe amen but how
[10:14] many believers do we have here tonight
[10:15] amen and so brother ban says what is in
[10:19] its unbelief every sin every unbelief of
[10:21] God's Word that that does so easily
[10:23] beset us we come up against something
[10:26] say well they preach that that was don't
[10:28] you do that you do just what God said do
[10:32] stay with it to the letter amen say it
[10:35] don't make any difference amen so I
[10:38] believe there in Hebrews chapter 11 if
[10:41] you read the whole chapter and we don't
[10:43] have time to read it it's the faith
[10:46] chapter and it's the witnesses Amen that
[10:49] God has had through the Paul was
[10:51] speaking through the Old Testament
[10:53] witnesses of what God's power in a
[10:57] believers life amen and and so here in
[11:00] every in every age God has a wit
[11:04] as a matter of fact he even told the
[11:07] disciples there and and that we went for
[11:10] them to go to the upper room and they
[11:12] would be endued with power from on high
[11:14] and from there they'll be there with his
[11:17] witnesses so when the Christian has the
[11:20] holy ghost tonight amen we are his
[11:22] witnesses amen praise God we are his we
[11:25] are his his love his his witness amen to
[11:28] the dying world it's dying in this hour
[11:31] amen praise the Lord so God always has
[11:34] witnesses and the Bible says he also
[11:36] that in the mouth of two or three
[11:38] witnesses let every word be established
[11:41] amen
[11:43] praise the Lord Jesus so Paul continues
[11:46] to say and if we want to let's read in
[11:47] 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 and the
[11:52] reason why we want to make sure we don't
[11:56] forget the things that God has done and
[11:59] this our day is one of them is so that
[12:00] your minds won't be corrupted a man Paul
[12:03] says here for I am jealous and verse 2
[12:05] for I am jealous over you with godly
[12:08] jealousy for I have espoused you to one
[12:11] husband that I may present you as a
[12:14] chaste virgin to Christ but I fear lest
[12:17] by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[12:19] though hyssop through his subtlety so
[12:22] your minds should be corrupted from the
[12:24] simplicity that is in Christ amen how
[12:28] many believe that Christ is simple amen
[12:30] he's complex to the world because they
[12:33] can't figure him out but to the believer
[12:35] the longer you stay with that word and
[12:37] feeding on that word the more simpler he
[12:39] gets I don't think he gets more
[12:42] complicated he gets more simpler at
[12:44] least that's been from my case they
[12:45] meant as the word as you're growing in
[12:47] the word he gets more simple amen so
[12:50] it's so it's always good to remember
[12:53] what God has done in 2nd Peter chapter 1
[12:56] Peter says it like this
[12:58] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[13:01] you always in remembrance of these
[13:03] things don't you know them and be
[13:07] established in the present truth amen
[13:10] yeah I think it meat as long as I am
[13:13] this Tabernacle to stir you up now
[13:15] brother
[13:16] he's been talking about revival they may
[13:18] what is revival stirring what you
[13:19] already have up stirring that word that
[13:22] is already in you amen
[13:24] that is a revival in your heart we're
[13:26] not waiting for lots of jumping a shout
[13:28] and screaming things like those are
[13:30] wonderful things and if it happens we
[13:31] needed amen well I believe we need that
[13:34] but but it's the word Amen that's that
[13:37] that needs to be stirred up in our
[13:39] hearts amen so just Paul says here to
[13:42] stir you up by putting you in
[13:45] remembrance or sorry Peter says here
[13:47] knowing that shortly I must put off this
[13:50] my Tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus
[13:52] Christ Christ hath showed me moreover I
[13:56] will endeavor that ye may be able after
[13:58] my decease to have these things always
[14:00] in remembrance amen for we have not
[14:04] followed cunningly devised fables as as
[14:08] they say we have as the people out there
[14:11] the unbeliever says we have cunningly
[14:13] devised fables but when we made known
[14:15] unto you the power and coming of our
[14:17] Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses
[14:19] of his majesty
[14:20] now here's Peter talking about him being
[14:24] an eyewitness because he was an
[14:25] eyewitness of what happened in Mount
[14:27] Transfiguration when Jesus took him and
[14:30] the other disciples he saw firsthand
[14:32] what had happened man for he received
[14:35] from God the Father honor and glory when
[14:37] there came such a voice to him from him
[14:39] the excellent glory this is my beloved
[14:42] Son in whom I am well pleased and this
[14:45] voice which came from heaven we heard
[14:47] when we were with him in the holy mount
[14:49] we have also a more sure word of
[14:53] prophecy amen so Satan when he comes in
[14:56] a man tries to give you bring some
[14:58] unbelief try to bring some of that doubt
[15:00] well you know what in the world - why
[15:02] when in the world do I believe what is
[15:05] it that I believe you know I he still
[15:08] can do it 40 years he into the message
[15:10] he still can do it 50 years in the
[15:12] message amen he still comes in and tries
[15:15] to bring that unbelief in our lot in our
[15:17] lives but but Peter says here we also
[15:20] have a more sure word of prophecy where
[15:23] until you do well that you take heed as
[15:25] unto a light that shine a--the in a dark
[15:27] place until the day
[15:29] dawn and the day star arise in your
[15:31] hearts amen praise God so let's look at
[15:35] the word witness the brothers can bring
[15:38] that up now look this at in Webster's
[15:42] dictionary and let's just down to the
[15:45] two the third one it says one asked to
[15:48] be present at a transaction so as to be
[15:50] able to testify to its having taken
[15:52] place one who has personal knowledge of
[15:56] something and then I like fob a some
[15:59] things serving as evidence or proof a
[16:01] sign it says right next to it so I
[16:05] clicked on the word sign and this is
[16:06] what the meaning of the word sign means
[16:08] a mark having a conventional meaning and
[16:13] used in place of words or to represent a
[16:16] complex notion a posted command warning
[16:19] or Direction something material or
[16:22] external that stands for or signifies
[16:24] something spiritual amen and then
[16:27] something indicating the presence or
[16:29] existence of something else
[16:32] amen praise the Lord now that's
[16:34] Webster's dictionary for the word sign
[16:37] amen
[16:38] praise God keep that in mind as we as we
[16:40] continue to look at look at this cloud
[16:43] now God he's given signs since the
[16:46] beginning he's always McGinn ado
[16:52] something on earth he always declares it
[16:53] in heaven Amen even brother Branham said
[16:56] that in Genesis 1:14 the Bible says
[16:59] there and God said let there be lights
[17:01] in the firmament of the heaven to divide
[17:04] the day from the night and let them be
[17:07] for signs and for seasons and for days
[17:11] and years so even from the beginning God
[17:14] established a man that that delights the
[17:18] the the the the things up in heaven amen
[17:22] the celestial bodies would be used for
[17:24] signs amen and so we see that and we
[17:29] have seen that throughout all of our
[17:30] years that God amen speaks to us even
[17:33] even in the and this our day he spoke
[17:37] the same exact way Amen brother branham
[17:40] had a sign Amen when he was born we saw
[17:44] that Amen when when when God Amen he
[17:47] said that he would write his first Bible
[17:49] was the zodiac and so he used the zodiac
[17:53] as his first Bible and and we see that
[17:56] the a star appeared before Jesus's birth
[18:01] that only only certain people were able
[18:04] to catch to it or see what it wouldn't
[18:06] what it was
[18:07] nobody maybe a lot of people like most
[18:10] people today they're not paying
[18:12] attention to what's going on but those
[18:14] individuals were and they knew that
[18:16] Messiah was to was to come on the earth
[18:19] because they were looking for him amen
[18:22] so God always declares his word in
[18:25] heaven first before he declares it on
[18:27] earth praise God now I want us to read
[18:30] this here and I'm just going set in this
[18:33] foundation as quick as I can so that's
[18:35] why I'm going a little quick amen
[18:37] because I have more content God in
[18:40] Isaiah chapter 7 because sometimes we we
[18:44] we say to ourselves well you know we
[18:48] don't sign we don't win that win as
[18:50] believers we don't follow signs or we
[18:52] don't look for signs and that is very
[18:54] true we don't we're not I don't need a
[18:57] sign amen to validate a man that God has
[19:00] given me the Holy Spirit or that this
[19:02] message is real or that the Bible is
[19:04] real they meant that means that God has
[19:07] not revealed his word to you amen praise
[19:10] God but sometimes God amen he's he's
[19:14] pleased to show signs amen
[19:16] to declare that his word is but to
[19:18] become is about to be established here
[19:22] on earth amen so if we read in Isaiah
[19:25] chapter 7 verses 9 through 14 this is a
[19:30] speaking of a has and a had this is a
[19:33] very familiar scripture to us but he has
[19:36] here I believe he was a commander of the
[19:39] army of Israel or and they were enough
[19:42] they were fighting against Samaria and
[19:44] some other some other
[19:46] nations at that time and watch what
[19:50] verse 9 says in the head of Ephraim is
[19:53] Samaria and the head of Samaria is room
[19:55] is remilia son if you will not believe
[19:58] surely you shall not be established so
[20:00] Isaiah came to to Ahaz and he gave him a
[20:05] word 2 and this is the word that he's
[20:07] telling him and so he's saying surely he
[20:10] shall not be established if you don't
[20:11] believe amen
[20:12] so verse 10 says moreover the Lord spake
[20:15] unto a has same as the a sign of the
[20:19] LORD thy God ask it either in the depth
[20:22] or in the height above so God is telling
[20:24] through Isaiah to tell a has asked me
[20:27] for a sign go ahead tell I could give it
[20:30] to you in heaven or I can give it to you
[20:32] on under under the under the earth or in
[20:35] the ocean but watch what a sir said a a
[20:39] has says but a has said I will not ask
[20:43] neither will I the Lord now that's very
[20:47] important and he said hear ye now o
[20:49] house of David it is a small thing for
[20:52] you to weary man but will ye weary my
[20:53] God also and there and then this is what
[20:56] this is when God through the lips of
[20:59] Isaiah speaks this to Ahaz and he says
[21:02] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[21:04] you a sign behold a virgin shall
[21:07] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[21:09] his name Emmanuel I'm pretty sure a has
[21:13] didn't understand what that was about
[21:15] what was about but that is where it was
[21:19] written a man that it was going to
[21:20] happen hundreds of years later and and
[21:24] and an a has he was not seeking a sign
[21:27] because you noticed what he said there
[21:29] and then but God was going to give that
[21:31] sign amen that word as a sign to let her
[21:35] to let them know hey this is going to
[21:37] take place here on earth it doesn't
[21:39] matter when hundreds of years laters it
[21:41] could have been the next day but it was
[21:43] going to happen because there was God
[21:44] speaking Amen now compare that to the
[21:47] difference of the way the Pharisees
[21:49] approached Jesus Christ and they were
[21:52] seeking after a sign they were seeking
[21:55] and they were saying okay if you're the
[21:57] Messiah
[21:58] assigned in other words tempting him
[22:01] amen and and Jesus says there in mark
[22:05] chapter 8 verse 11 he says and the
[22:08] Pharisees came forth and began to
[22:10] question with him seeking of him a sign
[22:13] from heaven tempting him and he sighed
[22:17] deeply Jesus I start deeply in his
[22:19] spirit and said why did this generation
[22:21] seek after a sign Amen I verily I say
[22:25] unto you there shall no sign be given
[22:27] unto this generation Amen and he just
[22:30] left it at that so God wants to show
[22:34] forth signs Amen but to those who are
[22:38] ready to receive them a man with a good
[22:40] and glad heart and know that that the
[22:43] word is true know that that it that it's
[22:46] right with the word a man God has shown
[22:48] us signs has shown us signs but if you
[22:52] come with the attitude of a like the
[22:54] Pharisees came to Jesus tent in him or
[22:57] are you are you really the Messiah are
[23:00] you really who you say you are you know
[23:01] didn't really believe exactly who he was
[23:04] yet seeking a sign God does not does not
[23:07] play around for nobody
[23:08] you see God doesn't need to give you a
[23:11] son just because you asked for it you
[23:13] see God does not need to do anything the
[23:16] same thing with the devil the devil
[23:17] showed him if you are the son of God
[23:20] do this that and the other and he could
[23:22] have but he didn't because he doesn't
[23:25] need the clan around for Satan right
[23:28] God has specific purposes of why he
[23:31] shows signs amen so they were tempting
[23:35] him and and in Deuteronomy 616 clearly
[23:38] says thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy
[23:39] God so they were not getting a sign
[23:41] because they were already breaking the
[23:43] law there and then and then the sign
[23:46] that they needed was already standing
[23:48] before them the word was already
[23:51] fulfilled in the Virgin amen when when
[23:54] Mary gave birth to Jesus that was
[23:57] already fulfilled that was a sign right
[23:59] there
[24:00] but they failed to see that and they
[24:03] were not getting any more signs amen so
[24:06] so signs from God sayings they're
[24:10] usually prelude to the word to the
[24:13] coming to the word coming forth amen
[24:16] now I know saying the human side of us
[24:20] sometimes we need that assurance amen
[24:24] - let us know hey we were going in the
[24:27] right direction
[24:28] amen this is this is right this is and
[24:32] God knows that God God was a human being
[24:35] just like you and I are a man and God
[24:37] created you and I so he knows that we
[24:40] have those those needs to be reassured
[24:42] amen
[24:43] and and so for for example I like to use
[24:47] this example that if you're traveling to
[24:50] Albuquerque New Mexico and you're using
[24:53] your GPS you don't have a paper map like
[24:57] the way we used to we used to use
[24:59] everybody uses their GPS now on their
[25:02] phone and so you're traveling and and
[25:06] brother Joe and sister Rachel they know
[25:08] the way they know the way to get to New
[25:10] Mexico and I know from my understanding
[25:13] you go hours with like nothing around
[25:16] you all of a sudden your GPS you're
[25:19] traveling and all of a sudden your GPS
[25:22] goes out and it's not working anymore
[25:25] what are you to do what are you supposed
[25:30] to do it there you probably start
[25:31] panicking what turn am I supposed to
[25:33] take next what everybody supposed to do
[25:34] next
[25:35] amen but if you see a sign amen and it
[25:40] says Albuquerque New Mexico
[25:42] 50 miles ahead well that helps you a man
[25:45] that gives you an assurance Amen oh ho
[25:48] well I'm on the right track amen I'm on
[25:51] the right Road my GPS may not be working
[25:53] but I see and I see that there's a gas
[25:55] station about three miles up ahead
[25:57] praise the Lord
[25:58] amen you see that as humans it reassures
[26:02] us amen so so God knows that and so
[26:05] that's what he has sent us signs amen
[26:08] not because we were tempting him not
[26:11] because we were asking
[26:13] but because God wanted to do it I mean
[26:15] in order to establish a man a sure word
[26:18] in our hearts amen
[26:19] praise God in Saints I believe in this
[26:21] day we serve mighty God amen with a sure
[26:24] word that has come down and this our day
[26:26] amen
[26:27] we don't serve anything no fables no
[26:29] cunning devices a man this is for real
[26:31] what's happened in this our day
[26:33] praise God and so Saints these signs
[26:37] they usually stumble the unbeliever
[26:40] and make and they make believer but it
[26:43] it gives the Oblivion assurance amen
[26:47] praise God so as we have read Amen in
[26:50] Hebrews 12:1 wherefore seeing we also
[26:52] compassed about with so great cloud of
[26:54] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[26:57] in the sin which doth so easily beset us
[26:59] and let us run with patience the race
[27:01] that is set before us amen so we see
[27:04] that there were witnesses there in
[27:06] Hebrews 11 and and you know what Saints
[27:08] nature is a witness amen
[27:10] remember brother brown talked about the
[27:12] the tree and how it loses his leaves
[27:15] amen and how it those leaves the life of
[27:18] that tree that sap a man goes down into
[27:21] the root of the tree and showing that
[27:24] the tree that there's a death but then
[27:28] what happens in the springtime the
[27:30] leaves start growing again amen and the
[27:32] showing that there's a resurrection
[27:33] taking place that's not the end of the
[27:36] tree just because you see it looks like
[27:38] it's dead out here doesn't mean that
[27:39] it's dead amen then it then it has a
[27:42] life amen through the summer until fall
[27:44] again and Saints we have to remember
[27:50] sometimes things may be going on in our
[27:53] lives amen there might be that fall time
[27:55] in our lives
[27:56] praise God where things are dying things
[27:59] seem bleak Amen but you know what that's
[28:01] the most beautiful time in God's eyes
[28:03] that's what the Bible says that the
[28:05] death of his Saints they're so precious
[28:06] in his eyes amen that's the most
[28:09] beautiful time for God the death of his
[28:11] Saints for one they're coming home but
[28:14] to a man that's that's beautifully meant
[28:16] because they have that promise of a
[28:17] resurrection amen for them praise God so
[28:22] and and and like I said earlier you and
[28:25] I are
[28:26] witnesses of Jesus when when the Holy
[28:28] Ghost is in our hearts amen
[28:30] when you have the new birth your witness
[28:32] amen of what God has done
[28:34] amen in the through through you in the
[28:37] word amen to be the word so now let's
[28:41] talk about here just a moment let's talk
[28:43] about clouds in the Bible amen
[28:46] how many are still with me praise the
[28:48] Lord
[28:48] amen all right so let's look at some
[28:53] clouds in the Bible amen because surely
[28:54] Saints if if this if we say that this is
[28:58] spiritual something spiritual just took
[29:00] place and I believe it is amen
[29:04] then surely there has to be an example
[29:06] in the Bible amen where this ties to
[29:09] right because God doesn't do nothing
[29:12] just doesn't bring anything new amen
[29:14] it has to tie in with the word somehow
[29:16] praise God and I believe it does so
[29:19] let's look at Exodus chapter 19 and
[29:22] we're just going to go through these
[29:24] quickly it happened in the in the in the
[29:26] ministry of moses and verse 7 and Moses
[29:29] came and called for the elders of the
[29:30] people and laid before their face all
[29:33] these words with to the lord commanded
[29:34] him and all the people answered together
[29:37] and said all the LORD hath spoken we
[29:40] will do and Moses returned the words of
[29:43] the people unto the Lord now watch verse
[29:45] 9 and the Lord said unto Moses lo I come
[29:50] unto thee in a thick cloud that now this
[29:55] is the reason why watch that the people
[29:57] may hear when I speak with thee and
[30:01] believe thee forever and Moses told the
[30:05] words of the people unto the Lord so
[30:08] there's the reason why
[30:09] God was going to speak he was getting
[30:12] ready to deliver his 10 the 10
[30:13] commandments the law to the people and
[30:16] God used this cloud this thick cloud
[30:19] that Moses went into and heard the voice
[30:22] of God so that they people could see it
[30:25] and believe what Moses came down from
[30:28] the mountain to tell them praise God
[30:31] so keep that in mind Saints as we as we
[30:34] continue we also see it in Exodus
[30:36] chapter 24 and verse 12
[30:40] it says in the Lord said unto Moses come
[30:43] on to come up to me into the mount and
[30:45] be there and I will give the tables of
[30:47] stone and a law and a commandment which
[30:50] I have written that thou may just teach
[30:52] them teach the people
[30:53] and Moses rose up and his minister
[30:56] Joshua and Moses went up in the Mount of
[30:59] God and he said unto the elders tarry ye
[31:02] here for us until we come again unto you
[31:05] and behold Aaron and Hur are with you
[31:09] If any man have any matters to do let
[31:10] him come unto them so Moses he took some
[31:13] witnesses up with him right he had some
[31:16] witnesses that that went up to the
[31:17] mountain with him amen and Moses went up
[31:21] into the mountain verse 15 and a cloud
[31:23] covered the Mount and the glory of the
[31:27] Lord abode upon the Mount Sinai and the
[31:30] cloud covered it six days and watch in
[31:34] the seventh day he called unto Moses out
[31:37] of the midst of the cloud now that
[31:40] pattern right there six days and then
[31:42] the seventh day something happens he
[31:45] called unto Moses out of the midst of
[31:46] the cloud and the sight of the glory of
[31:48] the Lord was like devouring fire on the
[31:51] top of the mountain in the eyes of the
[31:53] children of Israel so the children of
[31:55] Israel were watching this and Moses went
[31:58] into the midst of the cloud and got him
[32:00] up into the mountain and Moses was in
[32:02] the Mount forty days and forty nights
[32:04] and we know that he came down with the
[32:07] tables of stone with the commandments
[32:08] the Word of God to the people they men
[32:11] praise God so if that cloud was not
[32:14] important they wouldn't it wouldn't
[32:16] shouldn't have been in the word but it
[32:18] was very important to God because God
[32:20] had men put it in the word amen it
[32:23] happened in Moses ministry praise God
[32:26] now let's look at Mount Transfiguration
[32:27] Jesus ministry a cloud a cloud appeared
[32:31] as well in Matthew chapter 7 17 and
[32:34] after six days Jesus taketh Peter James
[32:37] and John and his brother his brother and
[32:41] bringeth them up into an high mountain
[32:42] apart so Jesus also took witnesses and
[32:46] then and was transfigured before them
[32:50] and his face did shine as the Sun and
[32:53] his raiment was white as the light amen
[32:57] and behold there appeared unto them
[32:59] Moses and Elias talking with him
[33:01] interesting these two prophets are the
[33:02] ones that come on that scene what was
[33:05] the ministries that brother Branham was
[33:06] was was was was - what I'm looking
[33:11] forward the ministries that brother bran
[33:12] was typing Moses and Elijah amen praise
[33:15] God let's just get down to verse 5 while
[33:20] he yet spake behold a bright cloud
[33:22] overshadowed them and behold a voice out
[33:26] of the cloud which said this is my
[33:29] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[33:32] hear you him again a cloud came on the
[33:35] scene as the word was going to come
[33:37] forth to Moses for the children of
[33:38] Israel here comes the Word of God which
[33:41] is Jesus Christ getting ready to come on
[33:43] the scene now everybody was to hear him
[33:45] amen from there God said hear ye him
[33:48] amen
[33:49] from that from that event and mount
[33:52] Transfiguration
[33:53] praise God so I'm going to skip some of
[33:56] these verses amen now let's look at
[33:59] brother Benton's ministry brother Browns
[34:00] ministry as I said it typed amen Moses
[34:03] and Elijah and brother Branham also the
[34:07] brothers could bring bring up the first
[34:09] picture we got some slides here for you
[34:12] tonight amen
[34:16] so this is very familiar to us but we
[34:22] should not take it lightly Saints
[34:24] honestly I feel that sometimes we just
[34:27] we take things so lightly and forget the
[34:30] great things that God has done and what
[34:32] this really represents to us today as a
[34:35] matter of fact I think this is greater
[34:36] to us now today than it was back then
[34:38] when it first went when it when it
[34:40] appeared because now we have a further
[34:42] understanding of the word amen and some
[34:45] of us as some of us may be younger ones
[34:47] we've grown up with these things we've
[34:50] grown up with looking at the seven
[34:51] church ages the hoffmans head of Christ
[34:53] and all these things added to us so it
[34:55] doesn't doesn't seem like it does
[34:57] anything to us but it's it's God a man
[35:00] showing to us a mandate
[35:02] he's revealing himself to us in this our
[35:04] generation you know and we should be
[35:06] thankful for that
[35:07] praise God so so brother Branham as as
[35:11] we see Moses he had some witnesses that
[35:14] went up to the mountain with him
[35:15] Jesus had some witnesses that went up to
[35:17] the mountain with him and of course if
[35:18] we brothers Branham also tells us that
[35:21] when he was up in the mountain there
[35:22] when that cloud came down he had some
[35:24] witnesses with there with him as well
[35:26] and two of those were brother Jean
[35:28] Norman and brother fred sauceman and
[35:30] they tell their testimonies as well of
[35:32] what happened there and it concurred
[35:34] with what brother Branham said and so
[35:37] and just and just reading this real
[35:39] quick this cloud was a sign for brother
[35:41] Branham to go back east to
[35:43] Jeffersonville Indiana to preach the
[35:45] seals amen
[35:46] it was a cloud that when the cloud
[35:49] appeared it was a sign to us of the
[35:51] coming opening of the word amen through
[35:54] the preaching of the seals amen
[35:56] so in all events in moses and moses the
[35:59] cloud came down to to show forth the
[36:03] coming word the ten commandments that
[36:05] was going to be for the people in the
[36:07] mount transfiguration the coming word
[36:09] amen Jesus amen
[36:11] there was a transfigured and he came to
[36:14] his to his full adoption there amen full
[36:17] adoption and and and so God says hear ye
[36:21] him and now amen and this day God said
[36:24] showed that cloud and brother branham
[36:26] and told brother Brown to go back east
[36:27] to preach the seals amen
[36:29] and so the cloud is a sign to us that
[36:32] Christ is here manifesting himself
[36:34] through his body called the bride amen
[36:36] praise God
[36:38] now I'm going pretty good amen praise
[36:43] the Lord
[36:43] how many are still with me I mean so
[36:46] you're understanding where we're going
[36:48] amen this is not just a picture and this
[36:52] is not just one single event there's a
[36:54] backup of it in the word amen so if
[36:56] somebody comes to you and saying well
[36:59] what is this you could tell them then
[37:01] the word it's there you know
[37:03] praise God so now let's just look at a
[37:06] couple of highlights if they could if
[37:08] they could search to the second second
[37:11] picture now this is the picture that we
[37:14] saw in this magazine
[37:15] here alright and and this is a it's on
[37:20] insultin page 111 and page 112
[37:24] interesting numbers by the way as well
[37:26] and so this picture was there and it was
[37:31] in a pyramid shape I think and we know
[37:34] Saints that Christ amen he's the head of
[37:37] the church and as we see here this is
[37:41] this is this is us growing a man walking
[37:44] in this in the statue of a perfect man
[37:47] they meant but I believe this that this
[37:49] this headstone right here is Christ and
[37:53] it's this message amen it's what brother
[37:56] Brennan preached after 1963 amen when
[37:59] those seals were opened this is what was
[38:01] coming down amen
[38:02] and so before that word was gonna be
[38:05] open those seals was gonna be open
[38:07] God manifests himself on in the form of
[38:10] a cloud in a form of a pyramid amen
[38:13] now the brother brother brother Joe gave
[38:17] me this just right before service
[38:20] started and I did not know this amen but
[38:23] the same constellations of angels that
[38:26] had appeared to William Branham on
[38:28] sunset peak also appeared in a cloud
[38:30] front form above Sunset Crater a
[38:33] mountain without a peak now I didn't
[38:37] know that there was a mountain without a
[38:38] peak there the southern edge of the
[38:42] cloud rested above Sunset Crater a
[38:44] mountain without a peak if the brothers
[38:46] could just skip all the way to picture
[38:48] number 12 you can just kind of close
[38:50] this down and skip all there it is right
[38:51] there where where this cloud appeared
[38:55] was over sunset mountain but apparently
[38:57] there's a mountain there with a crater
[38:59] right in it and look at this that is
[39:05] that's not a coincidence
[39:06] and watch the southern edge of the cloud
[39:10] rested above Sunset Crater in other
[39:13] words the southern part of the cloud I'm
[39:16] not sure if it's talking about this part
[39:17] or this part so anyways it was resting
[39:20] upon that crater and as you know the
[39:23] Pyramid was never capped this is a quote
[39:25] brother branham day
[39:26] stones yet to come it's been rejected
[39:28] could it be brethren sisters or is this
[39:31] that third pool that he told me three or
[39:33] four years ago amen so god that's
[39:37] interesting that and I did not know that
[39:39] amen so we can go back to picture number
[39:42] two again praise the Lord you love the
[39:50] Lord amen all right Saints so if you
[39:54] look closely here that brother Branham
[39:56] said that there was this a constellation
[39:58] of angels amen now to me and I don't
[40:02] know if you see this or not but to me if
[40:03] you look up here this is the way the the
[40:06] picture was shown on on yeah I believe
[40:14] yes this is the way the picture was
[40:16] shown on the magazine on Life magazine
[40:20] all right now we see here to me that
[40:23] looks like a lamb I don't know if it is
[40:26] or not but it looks like a lamb to me
[40:28] amen and so we see that right here amen
[40:33] if he turned the picture of sideways
[40:35] brother Brandon was told to turn the
[40:37] picture sideways and it's on the next on
[40:39] the next and then we see that it looks
[40:43] like Hoffman's head of Christ amen now
[40:45] in revelations chapter five Saints Amen
[40:48] the the the lamb amen
[40:51] if you read I don't we don't have time
[40:52] to read it but if you read revelations
[40:53] chapter five the only one that was that
[40:57] could open the seals was the lamb amen
[41:00] if you read there in revelations chapter
[41:01] five amen and so when he when he was
[41:05] going to open the seals amen this was a
[41:07] turning Amen that God Amen was turning
[41:10] from was was changing to from mercy and
[41:14] grace amen
[41:15] to to wrath and judgment that get ready
[41:17] to come he's looking down on the earth
[41:18] now a man if he if you look he's looking
[41:22] down on the earth and if you go to the
[41:24] next picture and we see that that
[41:29] picture looks that that cloud looks
[41:32] exactly just like Hoffman's head of
[41:33] Christ I mean we have it up here and you
[41:35] see and she the exact same thing
[41:38] so that is no coincidence and I could
[41:41] read to you Saints all kinds of quotes
[41:43] and all kinds of other things but we
[41:45] would just be here for days
[41:46] amen so let's look at the at the next as
[41:50] the next picture now we all know this
[41:52] magazine and I just pulled it up right
[41:53] here amen and it's interesting that this
[41:56] magazine was was came out on May 17th
[42:00] 1963 and the we know that may is the
[42:05] fifth month of the of the year the
[42:07] number five being the number of grace
[42:09] amen
[42:10] that's very important I don't think
[42:12] that's there just to be there amen
[42:14] but to 17th is also a very important
[42:18] number it's a number of judgment and
[42:21] victory amen brother Branham said and
[42:24] also the Bible supports it that that
[42:26] Noah went into the ark on the 17th of
[42:29] the second month and brethren say on May
[42:33] 17th now to us the second month would be
[42:35] February right amen
[42:38] but if you look at the Jewish calendar a
[42:39] man the first month is a beef which is
[42:42] April the second month is May so the
[42:45] Bible's not wrong and neither was
[42:47] brother branham's right praise God
[42:49] so that is no coincidence that this
[42:52] magazine came out on may 17 1963 showing
[42:57] us that God was turning it was it was
[42:59] God was turning now to four it is
[43:04] looking now all the grace they he was
[43:06] shown and of course he's still showing
[43:08] grace but it's just a sign a man that
[43:11] judgments get ready to strike the earth
[43:12] the word and of course we've seen
[43:15] judgment has been striking the this this
[43:18] nation ever the thing has gotten worse
[43:21] ever since then here in this on this
[43:25] nation amen so so so if you look at the
[43:31] magazine it's interesting that I'm just
[43:34] pointing out these things I'm not saying
[43:36] these things as doctrine you know but
[43:37] it's just interesting a Rockefellers
[43:40] honeymoon and as controversial as that
[43:43] may have seen is interesting that it's
[43:45] on the cover of this magazine amen
[43:47] as a union taking place
[43:50] amen and a honeymoon get being pronouns
[43:54] they met and I believe that's what God
[43:56] is doing right now a man then is bride
[43:58] Amen that's a union we should already be
[44:01] married to Christ that's why Paul said
[44:03] I've espoused you amen
[44:05] I was Powe sure and now while we're
[44:07] waiting is for a honeymoon
[44:08] to take place amen praise God very
[44:11] interesting also that it speaks about I
[44:14] believe it was Gary Cooper yeah Gordon
[44:19] Cooper to complete his twenty second
[44:22] space flight on a ship now I looked at
[44:25] that Gordon Cooper you know what the
[44:26] ship was he completed it later on that
[44:29] year the name of the ship was called
[44:31] faith 7 that was the name of the ship so
[44:37] so that was his gonna be his 22nd orbit
[44:41] and it was it was to be the longest
[44:42] orbit that he was to be that he was
[44:45] gonna be on so faith 7 that's very
[44:48] interesting so the next picture and we
[44:55] also know that brother Branham had
[44:56] during this time in 1962 he starts
[44:59] preaching the countdown amen showing us
[45:02] say men that we are the different stages
[45:07] Amen that this church has been moving
[45:09] that the church has been moving and now
[45:10] we're spiritual astronauts amen
[45:13] spiritual eagles that we can see
[45:15] anything amen praise God because we have
[45:19] that we have that we have the revelation
[45:21] of the word in this hour praise God
[45:23] now when you look at the magazine if
[45:26] those maybe you don't have don't have
[45:28] not looked at the magazine and page
[45:30] number 112 this is the the what's there
[45:35] and this is the article that's there and
[45:41] just I'm not gonna read all of this but
[45:44] just kind of highlight it this is
[45:46] hovering like a giant smoke ring a great
[45:48] cloud appeared at sunset over Flagstaff
[45:50] Arizona last February 28th and set off a
[45:54] continuing scientific mystery now the
[45:59] number 28 has a significance a man in
[46:01] God's and it's the number of life
[46:04] you man it's the number of life and what
[46:08] is the name of the magazine
[46:10] Life magazine so that's just a
[46:14] coincidence right
[46:15] brother Brennan was in a conspiracy with
[46:18] Life magazine and all that came out it
[46:22] gets better though
[46:24] instead off a continuing scientific
[46:27] mystery watcher struck by the clouds odd
[46:29] shape and huge size took pictures like
[46:31] these for at at different times and from
[46:34] widely scattered locations notice that
[46:37] if from almost every angle it looks like
[46:39] a pyramid kind of like a triangle tight
[46:43] dr. James McDonald the meteorologists at
[46:46] the Institute of atmospheric physics and
[46:48] Tucson has been accumulating the
[46:50] pictures using them as the basis for
[46:52] trigonometric calculation he has made a
[46:54] startling discovery that the cloud was
[46:55] at least 26 miles high and 30 miles
[46:58] across a lot higher and bigger he says
[47:01] then a cloud should be so is interesting
[47:05] that it's dr. James McDonald who you
[47:09] know he was an expert in clouds viewing
[47:12] clouds and he was the one who studied it
[47:15] and said that that that there wasn't any
[47:17] ordinary cloud at the at the spot where
[47:20] that cloud appeared clouds normally
[47:22] don't show up on there he says a lot
[47:25] higher and bigger he says than a cloud
[47:27] should be the circle was too high to be
[47:29] made by a jet plane and so far as planes
[47:32] as so far as dr. McDonald can determine
[47:35] there were no Rockets rocket planes or
[47:37] bombs being tested nearby that day he
[47:39] hopes anyone else with pictures will
[47:41] lend to him for he would like some more
[47:43] clues about the cloud 26 26 miles up no
[47:46] water droplets exist at that height to
[47:49] make a cloud so that was the article
[47:51] that was I was reading this right here
[47:53] that's what Life magazine put out amen
[47:56] so so we know that the number 28 is that
[48:02] is the number of life it's also the 28
[48:05] is that is it 28 days in a woman's
[48:09] monthly cycle and according to
[48:13] eyewitnesses the cloud was shining for
[48:16] about 28 min
[48:18] and then you can see this in other and
[48:22] other magazines where this article came
[48:25] I came out where this was reported 28
[48:27] minutes it was glistening and shining
[48:29] which is of course again very
[48:33] interesting because of the number 28
[48:35] amen
[48:36] as it was it was coming it was it was
[48:38] shining over Sunset Mountain the evening
[48:43] time sunset mountain amen and and it was
[48:48] if you notice the the Sun was setting
[48:51] when when this but yet the cloud was
[48:54] still luminescent Amen enough for the
[48:56] picture to be taken amen so the Rays a
[49:00] man it shall be light in the evening
[49:02] time hey man it was still enough light a
[49:06] man to show a man that Christ a man was
[49:09] trying to proclaim something to us a man
[49:11] praise God
[49:15] alright now if you notice here it says
[49:20] and a high cloud ring of mystery now you
[49:23] notice when you look at when you see dot
[49:26] dot dot Amen that's normally that looks
[49:29] like with that some thing it was talking
[49:32] about something and then dot dot dot it
[49:34] can there's a continuation you see all
[49:37] right so if you look go over to the next
[49:39] picture I was look I was looking at this
[49:43] the other the other last summer with my
[49:45] wife and I knew this picture was there
[49:46] the page before this is this picture and
[49:51] it's an article that says rainbow of
[49:53] moonbeams amen and the article the
[49:58] article talks about I'm not going to
[50:00] read it but the article talks about that
[50:02] this picture was taken by him by the the
[50:05] light from the moon so the cameraman was
[50:08] took the picture that moon was a full
[50:11] moon behind him and there was a storm in
[50:13] the distance and so the lights of the of
[50:16] the of the of the moon were there and it
[50:20] created this rainbow now according to
[50:23] the article and what I was looking up
[50:26] online this is a very rare occurrence
[50:28] some this this hardly ever gets
[50:31] much less beat a picture be taking of it
[50:34] but yet it was taken and placed just
[50:38] right before the article about the cloud
[50:40] just right right before it amen
[50:42] so if you read in the article it was
[50:45] taken at this picture was taken at 11
[50:48] o'clock at night right before midnight
[50:53] that's not a coincidence
[50:56] 11 o'clock and we are the 11th hour
[50:58] workers amen praise God like it's hard
[51:04] for me to read that article here and
[51:06] where this was taken was on and on the
[51:09] and in the state of Hawaii now if those
[51:14] tho Hawaii is the 50th state of the
[51:19] United States 50 of course is an
[51:22] important number to us it means do
[51:25] believe it amen
[51:27] praise God oh that's just a coincidence
[51:29] I don't think so
[51:33] amen now the word Hawaii means the
[51:37] homeland amen
[51:39] the homeland that's what the word Hawaii
[51:42] means and the picture was taken this
[51:45] picture was taken on the on the third
[51:47] largest island of hawaii called oahu and
[51:50] so my wife and me were reading and and
[51:53] and looking at this and we and she
[51:55] looked up and she what
[51:57] oh ah who meant and of course this is
[52:00] the third the third largest island of
[52:02] hawaii and of course three is a number
[52:06] of perfection so that's that's
[52:07] significant as well but Oahu means The
[52:10] Gathering Place
[52:11] Oh alga means the Gathering Place and so
[52:16] I think that's very interesting man
[52:18] praise God that we're to be gathered a
[52:20] men together God's trying to gather us
[52:22] together amen amen into one mine and to
[52:25] one Accord Amen so that we can get out
[52:27] of here st. so that the next step of the
[52:30] of this of the story could take place
[52:32] amen
[52:33] we're looking for a resurrection amen
[52:36] praise God
[52:38] so the the article says rainbow of Moon
[52:44] and then on the next picture if the
[52:48] brothers can bring it up and a high
[52:51] cloud ring of mystery so really it's one
[52:54] article you see cuz it's it's one right
[52:59] it's it's not two separate articles but
[53:01] it's one the person whoever was there
[53:03] put this together just so happen to just
[53:07] put these two together
[53:08] I don't think brother Branham called him
[53:10] up as hey can you put these two pictures
[53:11] together and bring them up together no I
[53:13] don't think that happened now I'm gonna
[53:16] just say this Saints that if that's if
[53:19] this is a conspiracy then then gods in
[53:21] it amen because this can't be done by
[53:26] anybody a man then just conjure this up
[53:29] then think of this up so you know to put
[53:32] this together
[53:33] but remember Saints that we have about a
[53:36] cloud of witnesses amen the Bible says a
[53:39] cloud of witnesses praise God so the
[53:42] articles that's a rainbow of moon beings
[53:45] and a high cloud ring of mystery and you
[53:48] see and is a conjunction it unites words
[53:52] together and sentences together amen
[53:54] and that's what God is doing in this
[53:56] hour amen he's uniting his bride to his
[53:58] head Amen that the capstone is coming
[54:01] down amen on top of the body and we are
[54:04] his body amen praise God we are the head
[54:07] we he is the head we are the body amen
[54:09] praise God now let's read revelations
[54:13] chapter 10 I hope that you're enjoying
[54:17] this praise God I don't know of any
[54:21] other way to talk about this but but
[54:23] this way amen
[54:24] I appreciate your your your your
[54:26] patience the brothers could bring it up
[54:30] revelations chapter 10 this is very in
[54:33] this is a very scripture that's very
[54:37] known well known to us now watch this
[54:40] and I saw another mighty angel come down
[54:43] from heaven clothed with a cloud all
[54:48] right
[54:48] and what and and a rainbow was upon his
[54:54] head
[54:56] and his face was as it were the Sun
[55:00] remember the cloud the rays of the Sun
[55:02] were still shining on the cloud so that
[55:04] the picture can be taken even though it
[55:06] was evening time and he had in his hand
[55:09] a little book open amen
[55:12] that's the most important part amen
[55:15] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[55:18] and his left foot on the earth and cried
[55:21] with a loud voice as where where a lion
[55:24] roars and when he had cried seven
[55:26] thunders uttered their voices Amen so if
[55:30] the brothers could bring up the next
[55:32] picture I I just happened I was when I
[55:37] was reading this with my wife and I I
[55:39] thought my so this before this was even
[55:45] I looked I looked this up online but it
[55:47] is confirmed by others on online and I
[55:50] said I wonder what happens when you when
[55:52] you put this cloud over this picture
[55:54] over into the light amen and that and if
[56:00] the brothers could bring up the next
[56:01] picture this might be old news to you
[56:05] but it's new news to me
[56:09] the next picture or did he already click
[56:13] it go back go back alright so when you
[56:16] when you hold this article into the
[56:18] light they man this is exactly what you
[56:19] see you see you see the rainbow Amen
[56:22] jumping over over the cloud the the the
[56:26] cloud amen exactly amen exactly what
[56:30] revelations chapter 10 talks about Amen
[56:33] if you have that magazine you can try it
[56:35] yourself I'm not going to attempt to try
[56:37] but I found these online that people had
[56:39] already done it and took pictures of it
[56:41] so if you hit the next picture if you
[56:44] rip out that that upper part where it
[56:46] says an acai clobbering of mystery this
[56:49] is exactly what that what that looks
[56:50] like right there I don't think that's a
[56:53] coincidence ain't Amen God amen
[56:58] declaring himself Amen as as the same
[57:01] yesterday today and forever amen
[57:03] praise God and using Life magazine as a
[57:08] witness
[57:09] amen as a witness to let us know amen
[57:14] that we're not believing cunningly
[57:16] devised fables amen again I don't think
[57:19] brother Brennan was in a conspiracy with
[57:21] Life magazine I just have a hard time
[57:24] believing there I mean and I don't I
[57:28] don't know maybe the person who put this
[57:30] together these two articles together was
[57:31] I don't know if he was a Christian or
[57:32] not probably probably wasn't God
[57:37] anointed amen or to put that together
[57:39] amen
[57:40] for you and I it's gonna be for the
[57:43] unbeliever it's just gonna make him be
[57:45] more of an unbeliever amen for the for
[57:48] the make believer is just gonna make
[57:49] them be more make-believe for the
[57:50] believer it helps us in our walk amen
[57:53] praise God now Saints I want you to keep
[57:55] in mind that this is not amen this is
[57:58] not what saves us this is not what feels
[58:01] this way the Holy Ghost amen
[58:03] this is just a sign they men pointing
[58:06] amen and we're gonna talk here just a
[58:08] moment about the voice of the sign amen
[58:10] because that's very important we need to
[58:13] be listening to the voice of the sign
[58:16] sometimes again signs and wonders we
[58:19] need them amen
[58:20] but it helps us but it's not what saves
[58:24] us amen and so sometimes we use these
[58:28] things a man as a comfort as a as a
[58:31] blanket amen
[58:33] for for our salvation and you can have
[58:36] this magazine in your and your in your
[58:38] house you can have every picture
[58:40] everything every diagram and you still
[58:43] not believe the word and you still not
[58:45] understand the word amen I hope you
[58:48] understand that so it's perfectly laying
[58:52] out what revelations tens one says Amen
[58:57] brother branham gets caught up into that
[58:59] cloud and he's told to go back east to
[59:01] preach the seals Amen now so we read in
[59:05] Revelations 10:1 and then further down
[59:08] in Revelations 10 7 if you want brothers
[59:11] want to bring that up
[59:12] revelations Tim 1 was the mighty angel
[59:14] which was G which is Jesus Christ comes
[59:18] down with the open book right because
[59:21] remembering in revelations 5 he was the
[59:23] only
[59:23] one that could open the seals thereof a
[59:25] man of that book he opened them now at
[59:27] revelations 10 and then but the mystery
[59:30] there was still mysteries there because
[59:33] the thunders the the the thunders roared
[59:36] and John was prohibited to not write
[59:38] what those thunders had said but in rib
[59:42] in that same chapter in Revelation
[59:44] chapter 10 verse 7 it says but in the
[59:46] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[59:48] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[59:51] of God should be finished amen and of
[59:54] course the magazine's also calls it a
[59:56] mystery amen but for us amen when when
[1:00:00] that's that's what brother Branham was
[1:00:02] to do amen was to reveal these mysteries
[1:00:04] they come from him it had to be God to
[1:00:07] give him a man what we needed for us to
[1:00:10] hear in this hour brother Brandon didn't
[1:00:12] know himself amen
[1:00:14] look what brother brown says here in
[1:00:15] this quote look what we've seen in this
[1:00:19] day the quickening power has come to us
[1:00:21] to open the seven seals what was that
[1:00:24] the intelligence of a man
[1:00:26] no the quickening power of God see the
[1:00:30] quickening power of God foretold this
[1:00:32] would take place the see the quickening
[1:00:35] power of God made the world testify to
[1:00:37] it it's the truth he's talking about
[1:00:39] this cloud here and this and this quote
[1:00:42] the angel the Lord I told you was around
[1:00:45] in a pillar of fire quickening power let
[1:00:47] the world testify that it's the truth
[1:00:50] and in that they didn't know what it was
[1:00:53] and when you just looked this away and
[1:00:57] it's our Lord up there you see he is the
[1:01:01] one who opened those seals he is those
[1:01:04] he is those seals for the whole Word of
[1:01:07] God is Christ and Christ is the seals
[1:01:11] that was opened
[1:01:12] what is the opening of the seals then
[1:01:14] revealing Christ amen
[1:01:17] revealing it and if it's very revealing
[1:01:19] Christ as those seals if that words in
[1:01:21] you then it's revealing Christ in you
[1:01:24] amen
[1:01:24] praise God and that's a mystery Paul
[1:01:26] said but it's a mystery to the world but
[1:01:29] it shouldn't be a mystery to us say Amen
[1:01:31] praise God the greatest mystery was
[1:01:34] Christ in you
[1:01:35] the hope of glory nope with the US with
[1:01:38] the open book Saints I mean we have so
[1:01:41] much to be thankful for
[1:01:42] amen so much to be thankful for so much
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:46] so much to to - that has happened and
[1:01:51] that God has done for us to be bored to
[1:01:56] get bored with the word oh it's another
[1:01:58] service now Christ has done great things
[1:02:01] in this hour and he's still a man this
[1:02:03] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:02:05] praise God
[1:02:07] but brother Branham came on the scene on
[1:02:10] verse 7 right because we know that was
[1:02:12] brother Branham in Revelations 10 7
[1:02:13] right but revelations 10 8 vs. 8 verses
[1:02:18] 8 through 11 that was the part that we
[1:02:23] need to do you know the Bible says there
[1:02:27] in revelations 10 verses 8 it says and
[1:02:30] the voice which I heard from heaven this
[1:02:32] is John speaking and the voice which I
[1:02:35] heard from heaven spake unto me again
[1:02:37] and said go and take that little book so
[1:02:41] it wasn't enough for the book to be open
[1:02:43] Saints it was great that it was opened
[1:02:46] and it wasn't enough for then the next
[1:02:49] step amen
[1:02:50] remember the hot the cloud that the
[1:02:52] mighty angel came down and opened a book
[1:02:55] so the cloud came down it showed itself
[1:02:57] there in all over Arizona that was
[1:02:59] wonderful
[1:03:00] brother Branham went over to
[1:03:02] Jeffersonville Indiana preached the
[1:03:03] seals the seals were opened amen that's
[1:03:06] wonderful but what's the next step it's
[1:03:11] for us to eat up those seals as for us
[1:03:15] to eat that word amen now though he
[1:03:19] asked me the other day he wants us to
[1:03:20] eat a book my Zoey yes he wants us to
[1:03:26] eat a book not a literal book he wants
[1:03:29] us to eat the life of the book hey man
[1:03:31] cuz you can eat this book and you can or
[1:03:34] you can ingest it physically reading it
[1:03:38] the letter killeth but the spirit is the
[1:03:40] one that gives lives amen praise God so
[1:03:44] it says in the voice which I heard from
[1:03:46] heaven spake unto me again
[1:03:48] and take the little book which is
[1:03:49] opening the angel hand of the angel
[1:03:51] which stand it upon the sea and upon the
[1:03:54] earth a man and as brother branham had
[1:03:56] to obey the Lord the voice of the Lord
[1:03:59] that told him when he went up into that
[1:04:02] cloud and that constellation go and the
[1:04:05] seals will need it to be preached they
[1:04:07] men and he went he needed to fulfill
[1:04:10] that he needed to obey same thing for us
[1:04:13] when the voice is speaking unto us amen
[1:04:15] when the voice is speaking unto us and
[1:04:17] verse 8 that's exactly what we need to
[1:04:20] do we need to eat this book amen I hope
[1:04:24] you understand what I'm trying to say
[1:04:25] basica amen in verse 9 it continues to
[1:04:29] say and I went unto the angel and said
[1:04:31] unto him give me the little book and he
[1:04:34] said unto me take it and eat it up it's
[1:04:36] free take it you didn't have to pay
[1:04:39] anything for it God did it all they
[1:04:41] meant he took care of it praise God and
[1:04:43] it shall make thy belly bitter but it
[1:04:46] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[1:04:48] verse 10 and I took the little book out
[1:04:51] of the Angels hand it was it was the
[1:04:54] mighty angel amen and ate it up
[1:04:57] amen brother branham he can't spoon feed
[1:05:00] us Amen he's given us the word he's he's
[1:05:03] he's given us the word amen but it takes
[1:05:06] you amen to take the book grab it and do
[1:05:09] something with it they meant it takes
[1:05:11] you to get a personal revelation from
[1:05:13] God I can't depend on brother Dale to
[1:05:16] give me a revelation he can't brother
[1:05:18] we´d can't give me a revelation another
[1:05:19] minister can't give a relation but God
[1:05:21] amen whoo I'm grabbing the book from can
[1:05:24] give me a revelation praise God
[1:05:26] Christ can give me a revelation of that
[1:05:28] book and it was in my mouth sweet as
[1:05:30] honey and as soon as I had eaten it my
[1:05:32] belly was bitter and he said unto me
[1:05:35] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:05:39] peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:05:42] kings and I believe that's what the
[1:05:43] Bride of Christ is doing right now the
[1:05:45] true fivefold ministry in this hour amen
[1:05:48] that's exactly what we're doing amen
[1:05:50] praise God it doesn't have to be the
[1:05:53] fivefold ministry Saints praise God you
[1:05:55] have a were a sure word of a
[1:05:57] in this hour of prophecy in this hour
[1:05:59] amen take advantage of the word and the
[1:06:02] word will fight for you praise God so we
[1:06:05] need to obey Saints the voice of the
[1:06:08] sign praise God and I'm almost done we
[1:06:11] need to obey what that voice said all
[1:06:13] right

[1:06:18] sign thank God that God showed himself a
[1:06:21] man he's got witnesses witnesses have
[1:06:25] the guy with the cigarette and he's got
[1:06:29] witnesses in this hour we're witnesses

[1:06:39] sentence it's time for us to get the
[1:06:41] life the true life of Christ amen
[1:06:45] watch what brother Branham says the
[1:06:47] voice of the sign in 1964 Noah a prophet
[1:06:51] on the land in the land a sign of the
[1:06:54] coming judgement Moses a prophet in the
[1:06:58] land the sign of a coming judgment

[1:07:04] coming judgment john a prophet in the
[1:07:08] land a sign of coming judgment to israel
[1:07:11] they were absolutely cut off notice sign
[1:07:17] what does the sign do the sign is to
[1:07:20] attract the attention and get the
[1:07:22] elected ready and out of the way before
[1:07:25] judgment strikes that's what that sign
[1:07:29] was amen
[1:07:33] that's what Noah did it got the elected
[1:07:36] ready the rest of them and what does it
[1:07:38] do the sign and the voice of the sign
[1:07:42] condemns the unbeliever and gets him
[1:07:45] ready for judgment see Saints the same
[1:07:51] water that saved Noah in the boat is the
[1:07:54] same water that condemned the
[1:07:56] unbelievers in that hour that same water
[1:07:59] that helped raise the the boat up and
[1:08:02] saved Noah it drowned the unbelievers in
[1:08:05] that hour
[1:08:06] see and this sign Amen that is a
[1:08:09] blessing and a grace grace unto us a
[1:08:13] manna for the believer but it's a
[1:08:16] judgment sign for the unbeliever for the
[1:08:18] world you see the sign and the voice of
[1:08:22] the sign condemns the unbeliever and
[1:08:24] gets him ready for judgment it gets the
[1:08:26] elected ready for this for the escape
[1:08:29] that's what sign is that's what signs
[1:08:32] are given for for the coming judgment to
[1:08:36] the elected they see it Amen praise the
[1:08:39] Lord Jesus amen aren't you thankful that
[1:08:42] you can see it in this hour
[1:08:43] praise God many people cannot see that
[1:08:46] many people cannot cannot cannot break
[1:08:49] these things down and look at God hid it
[1:08:52] in such a way that they can't do it
[1:08:56] instead they'll criticize it but blessed
[1:09:02] are your eyes for they see praise God
[1:09:06] now we'll finish my it's awesome I was
[1:09:11] able to finish up I thought I had a lot
[1:09:13] of a lot of stuff and I guess I
[1:09:15] I just went really fast Hebrews chapter
[1:09:18] 12 let's just read that again to kind of
[1:09:21] seal the the thing here again wherefore
[1:09:26] seeing we also are compassed about with
[1:09:29] so a great with so great a cloud of
[1:09:34] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:09:38] in the sin which does so easily beset us
[1:09:41] Saints God has done so much for us amen
[1:09:46] for us to be dilly-dallying with the
[1:09:48] things of the world for us to be in sin
[1:09:51] in this hour the sign has already been
[1:09:53] given judgment is getting ready to
[1:09:55] strike they could come at any moment for
[1:09:58] you to say I'll serve God in about 10
[1:10:00] years 10 years may not happen I'll serve
[1:10:03] God next year next year may not happen
[1:10:05] I'll serve God in in next week next week
[1:10:09] may not happen for you they may happen
[1:10:11] to others but it may not happen to you
[1:10:14] because you are not guaranteed to live
[1:10:16] the next five minutes I am NOT Gary
[1:10:19] to live the next five minutes but that
[1:10:21] sign has already said that there's
[1:10:23] judgment coming in men and if you don't
[1:10:26] believe the sign amen if you don't
[1:10:28] believe that sign that God has sent amen
[1:10:30] in other words that has take us to the
[1:10:32] voice of the sign amen
[1:10:34] the word amen in this hour to apply the
[1:10:37] word into your life so that God can do
[1:10:40] something great through you I'm afraid
[1:10:42] the only thing left is judgment that's
[1:10:45] the only thing left because God has
[1:10:48] already given us everything that we need
[1:10:49] God has already done everything that he
[1:10:52] could for you and I he's died on the
[1:10:55] cross he's paid the way for you and if
[1:10:57] you reject it and you keep rejecting
[1:10:59] there will be one day where you will
[1:11:01] reject it for the last time you will
[1:11:04] reject it for the last time and there
[1:11:06] will be no more mercy for you then
[1:11:08] you're gonna have to depend on going in
[1:11:10] through your works then and I don't want
[1:11:13] to go in by that because my the Bible
[1:11:16] already says that my works are like
[1:11:17] filthy rags before God's eyes my works
[1:11:21] are like filthy rags before God's eyes I
[1:11:23] want to go in and his marriage Saints
[1:11:25] I'm gonna go in with what he's already
[1:11:28] done see we complicate the thing when
[1:11:32] God has already made a way easy for us
[1:11:35] ensure Saints the Christian life is not
[1:11:38] easy
[1:11:39] whoever said that the Christian life was
[1:11:42] easy is lying to you
[1:11:44] or they're trying to take your money
[1:11:47] because that's not the case all of you
[1:11:50] who are true Christians know that that's
[1:11:52] the case it's a mind battle every single
[1:11:55] day Satan is battling you and if you
[1:11:58] don't have that battle in your mind then
[1:12:01] God has not been doing something in you
[1:12:02] but it's got if you're if that battle is
[1:12:06] there and then your wrestling event day
[1:12:09] by day trying to defeat this flesh
[1:12:11] trying to defeat yourself dying out to
[1:12:13] yourself a man then God a man I believe
[1:12:16] God is doing something in you I believe
[1:12:19] God is doing something no man let us lay
[1:12:21] aside every weight in other words when
[1:12:25] the runners Paul speaking here of when
[1:12:28] runners were running the races back then
[1:12:30] in the stadiums and you know
[1:12:32] running the races they would get a get
[1:12:34] rid of every weight off of them some of
[1:12:37] them probably even shaving their hair
[1:12:39] off their skin to take every weight off
[1:12:43] so that they can run the race and man
[1:12:46] and get to that finish line praise God
[1:12:49] and that's what Paul is telling us let
[1:12:50] us lay aside every weight and the sin
[1:12:52] the unbelief which does so easily beset
[1:12:56] us the unbelief so easily besets our
[1:13:01] life
[1:13:02] in other words sin so easily creeps in
[1:13:05] into our life it's so easy for sin and
[1:13:09] then it's so hard to get rid of it amen
[1:13:12] when you've already let it just just a
[1:13:15] rock you to sleep once you're in it it's
[1:13:18] hard to get out of it
[1:13:20] but it's not impossible because God's
[1:13:24] made the way amen in the sin which this
[1:13:29] so easily beset us and let us run with
[1:13:31] patience the race that is set before us
[1:13:34] let us be patient Saints God has done
[1:13:37] his part let us do our part let us be
[1:13:40] patient God's not selective fulfill his
[1:13:42] promises looking unto Jesus the author
[1:13:45] and finisher of our faith looking unto
[1:13:48] Him remember the boy who was riding the
[1:13:51] bicycle a man and the others did not
[1:13:53] make it to the end of the race and they
[1:13:55] asked him how did you win the race he
[1:13:57] said I just kept my eyes on the finish
[1:13:59] line on the mark of the high calling
[1:14:01] amen
[1:14:02] Christ Jesus amen praise God not looking
[1:14:06] to anything else not looking to the
[1:14:07] world not looking to the music of the
[1:14:09] world not looking to the movies of the
[1:14:10] world not looking to everything else
[1:14:12] going on around us coronavirus or no
[1:14:15] coronavirus it doesn't matter God has
[1:14:17] come down on the scene amen
[1:14:19] God has manifest as himself through his
[1:14:21] word amen all the coronavirus can be

[1:14:28] that no plague shall dwell not dwelling
[1:14:31] come nigh thy dwelling amen praise God
[1:14:34] and if God's not ready to take you a man
[1:14:36] then you're not gonna go amen
[1:14:39] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:14:41] finisher of our faith that's why he's
[1:14:44] the Alpha and the Omega verse 3 for
