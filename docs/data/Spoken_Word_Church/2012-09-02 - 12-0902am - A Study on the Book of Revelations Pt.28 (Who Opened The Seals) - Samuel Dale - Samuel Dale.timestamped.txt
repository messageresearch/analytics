[5:12] amen Revelations
[5:17] 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[5:20] God gave unto him to show unto his
[5:22] servants things which must shortly come
[5:24] to pass and he said and signified it by
[5:27] his Angel unto his servant John the by
[5:30] record of the word of God and of the
[5:31] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[5:34] things that he saw blessed is he that
[5:36] readeth and they that hear the words of
[5:37] this prophecy and keep those things
[5:40] which are written therein for the time
[5:43] is at hand now we go to First Peter 1
[5:48] ver9 receiving the end of your faith
[5:50] even the salvation of your souls of
[5:53] which salvation the prophets have
[5:54] inquired and searched diligently who
[5:57] prophesied of the grace that should come
[5:58] unto you searching what or what manner
[6:02] of time the spirit of Christ which was
[6:04] in them did signify when it testified
[6:07] beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
[6:09] the glory that should follow unto whom
[6:11] it was revealed that not unto themselves
[6:13] but unto us they did Minister the things
[6:15] which are now written unto
[6:17] you how excuse
[6:21] me they did Minister the things which
[6:23] are now reported unto you by them that
[6:26] have preached the gospel unto you with
[6:28] the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven
[6:30] which things the Angels desired to look
[6:32] into wherefore G up the loins of your
[6:35] mind be sober in hope to the end for the
[6:38] grace that is to be brought to you at
[6:40] the revelation of Jesus Christ you may
[6:43] be seated Lord at his Blessing to the
[6:46] reading of the word if some of the
[6:48] brothers would give these quotes out I
[6:50] wanted to make sure this to you know I
[6:54] want to try to finish up the part that
[6:55] I'm talking on this and and just to uh
[7:00] get it you
[7:02] know into your hearts and thinking about
[7:05] what I'm saying and then God has to
[7:09] reveal it because that's one thing I
[7:10] believe I believe no man can reveal
[7:14] anything even Jesus said by quoting the
[7:17] prophet that my own life didn't reveal
[7:19] that unto thee it takes the father to
[7:22] reveal it so it's going to take the Holy
[7:24] Spirit to reveal the word or or we won't
[7:27] get it see we can have the letter of the
[7:29] word we can read it and say well we
[7:32] understand we can have the quotes from
[7:35] The Prophet to say well here's what the
[7:37] prophet said but that still doesn't make
[7:40] it a
[7:41] revelation I tried to emphasize that
[7:44] unto us to where that we could could see
[7:46] and and and get a better understanding
[7:50] we had a real good time last night at
[7:52] the at the Bible study and we were on
[7:55] justification and we didn't get into any
[7:58] of the uh of the scriptures basically uh
[8:01] we will take that up at the next uh
[8:04] meeting but you know about justification
[8:07] but I was just mainly talking about you
[8:10] know your time you
[8:12] repented and ask God to forgive you
[8:15] because that's where justification
[8:17] starts starts where you repented of your
[8:20] sins you ask God to forgive you that
[8:22] starts a work in you that's
[8:24] justification chopping off you P sins
[8:27] the prophet said future home said it
[8:29] does nothing to the nature or anything
[8:31] of you it just chops off that sin when
[8:34] we tried to bring that in last night and
[8:36] then we did pick up a little bit to get
[8:38] up to uh justification through the
[8:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother U
[8:46] Joe will make you a copy if you desire
[8:49] of the uh Bible study so that you can
[8:52] listen to it you know all right but just
[8:56] pray that the Lord would guide us on
[8:57] them more because we'll be trying to to
[8:59] go into that later
[9:01] now we've been talking about
[9:05] the you know the Book of Revelations and
[9:09] we got into where we were trying to
[9:11] bring which was actually to to bring us
[9:14] to the to the uh fifth chapter and
[9:19] bringing us to that CH fifth chapter
[9:21] we've come to a place and spent quite a
[9:24] time uh talking about these things that
[9:28] are are made known and and we can see
[9:31] that you know the bride this the fifth
[9:34] chapter is the bride in glory after the
[9:38] Rapture all right and then from that
[9:41] then we went on to try to pick up some
[9:44] of the things and bring them to you and
[9:46] I chose today to just give you the
[9:48] quotes and that way then you know once I
[9:51] go along into the other parts of the
[9:54] seals and the things then you would have
[9:57] the quotes in front of you are keep keep
[9:59] it in front of you I would invite you to
[10:00] bring these quotes back with you and
[10:03] stick them in your Bible or something to
[10:06] you know to be able
[10:08] to when I say something then you won't
[10:11] be confused cuz you'll know that we
[10:13] already this has already been covered
[10:15] you know in our understanding now in
[10:19] doing that then let's just pick up where
[10:21] the Prophet said chapter 5 I I've spent
[10:25] quite a lengthy time now this is a 20 we
[10:28] finished 27 messages on this and uh you
[10:32] know I pray that it's been helpful to
[10:34] you uh it has to me to speak on it and
[10:38] we spoke most of these quotes that we're
[10:40] going to give you to start with are
[10:41] quotes that we have given over and over
[10:44] and over throughout the message that
[10:48] we've been trying to bring over all of
[10:50] these these sermons and then doing that
[10:53] then let's just look at what the prophet
[10:55] had to
[10:56] say go ahead and pull up brother
[10:59] Anderson number one under the quotes
[11:02] these brothers are getting so good until
[11:04] someone's coming out of the offices now
[11:06] to get sit out out here and enjoy the
[11:09] fellowship out here you know we really
[11:11] appreciate them and appreciate them the
[11:13] fact that they'll be going with us to be
[11:15] able to help us on the Daniel 70 weeks
[11:18] we wish we could take everybody but uh
[11:20] we don't have actually the authority to
[11:22] bring too many with us but we've asked
[11:24] permission to bring the technicians with
[11:27] us to where that we could put it up in
[11:30] you know and take her own videos and
[11:32] things and and making what do you call
[11:35] those big old words I never have do it's
[11:38] a
[11:39] PowerPoint you know they call that a
[11:41] PowerPoint you know you make a
[11:42] PowerPoint well I make a PowerPoint the
[11:44] whole time I'm just pointing I'm trying
[11:47] to point you to the message of the hour
[11:50] which is pointing you to the Bible and
[11:52] that's a great power
[11:53] point it's it's wonderful to be that and
[11:57] you know to understand all right now
[12:00] look what the prophet had to say CU
[12:02] we've been over this quote many times
[12:04] but look what he says this is taken from
[12:07] uh Revelation 5 paragraph 79 and
[12:11] 80 and we find out then that this
[12:14] beginning of the chapter then we find
[12:15] that the the fifth chapter is just a tie
[12:18] block it it's a diamond hitch that ties
[12:20] the last part of the church age of the
[12:23] third chapter the fourth chapter tells
[12:25] what John was taken up into heaven and
[12:28] the fifth chapter is preparing for these
[12:31] where you went through the church ages
[12:33] now want you then John's lifted up in
[12:35] the fourth chapter and the fifth chapter
[12:37] he's just setting a scene for the
[12:40] opening of The Seven Seals just as he
[12:42] did in the first chapter of Revelations
[12:46] opening the way for the church seven
[12:48] Church ages the name he's going back to
[12:51] that to show you there he stands in the
[12:53] seven golden Candlestick and he look
[12:54] upon a jasper sard stone and he's
[12:56] preparing for the seven Church ages Le
[12:59] we prepared back there for the church
[13:01] ages in chapter 1 now we come into
[13:05] chapter 5 and he's preparing for
[13:09] what now he's preparing for the opening
[13:12] of those Seven Seals of
[13:15] redemption see that's what the fifth
[13:17] chapter is that's the reason I kind of
[13:19] read it and then take it from there and
[13:21] talk on it and give the other parts of
[13:24] the scripture is because it's it isn't
[13:26] verse by verse something that's
[13:28] happening it's preparing for something
[13:30] to happen and if you get to
[13:33] preparation then you've just you you're
[13:35] ready for it then That's the Way It Is
[13:38] by faith or anything else so what did he
[13:40] say up in the quote up above preparing
[13:43] for
[13:44] what this is the preparing for the
[13:46] opening of The Seven
[13:48] Seals now we say well you know the
[13:51] prophet it just it just that just seals
[13:53] open it was just that way and and we
[13:56] want to get to a point in a little bit I
[13:58] want to ask you you a
[14:00] question but go ahead with number two on
[14:03] the notes
[14:06] brother look what he says about this
[14:08] fifth
[14:10] chapter this is paragraph 290 of the
[14:13] breach preaches 63 through1 17 and now
[14:17] watch what he done that watch what taken
[14:19] place you talk about a jubilee now this
[14:22] is the fifth chapter all
[14:25] right now this is exactly the opening of
[14:28] them seals take place now if you look in
[14:31] your book on the the doing they change
[14:34] that from taking to take which is no
[14:37] difference in the word but they tried to
[14:39] revise a lot of things in the new
[14:41] edition of your computer right but now
[14:45] look he says that actually in chapter 5
[14:48] is the breaking of those
[14:51] seals well we know that chapter
[14:54] 6 is when they start
[14:57] breaking you know the lamb breaks the
[14:59] seal Etc but now I've tried to get you
[15:03] to see what about it that you and I as
[15:08] the Bride of Jesus
[15:11] Christ there is no book in the hand of
[15:14] the one sitting on the throne until this
[15:17] end time bride completes that book
[15:21] that's right right it's going to be
[15:24] completed cuz that's what he said said
[15:26] once the book is completed then the lamb
[15:28] can take the book B all right see then
[15:30] we are the book right is any problem
[15:33] with that the Believers in the book is
[15:35] the book we said when I look at the book
[15:37] well there's a lot in the book that
[15:39] doesn't apply to you and I right we're
[15:42] going to get to that this morning in
[15:44] part to show but yet you and I are in
[15:48] the book not our names written there as
[15:50] Samuel Dale and and you know and Dick
[15:53] Addison or anything like that but it's
[15:55] like brother R said about brother
[15:57] brother um
[15:59] there at the brother Neville he said now
[16:02] it's his name being in the book said
[16:05] it's what's the hour that you're living
[16:07] is written in the book all right now I
[16:10] believe that you and I are living in the
[16:12] last days don't you I certainly hope
[16:16] so you know I'm already 72 but I'm not
[16:20] worried about it you know but I believe
[16:22] we're in the last days but you know what
[16:24] I believe when I come into the
[16:26] message and saw it the Prophet was
[16:29] beginning to say to I believe that was
[16:30] the end days didn't you I believe we're
[16:33] in the end time the end time is not just
[16:35] to say one day or
[16:38] whatever there's got to be a people make
[16:40] this word alive in this end time amen
[16:43] and that's what I've been driving at all
[16:44] the time because the reason I can say
[16:47] that is the fifth chapter shows us in
[16:49] heaven right all right so then that
[16:52] means somebody's going to be there right
[16:56] is that simple enough somebody's going
[16:58] going to be there in heaven one day to
[17:01] fulfill this chapter
[17:03] 5 all right and then doing that why
[17:07] can't we believe we're
[17:09] them right and if we are then we're the
[17:12] words that's in the book Paul said
[17:14] you're written
[17:15] officials known and read of all man
[17:18] brother R said if it was time to write
[17:20] it we no need of it he said because it
[17:22] would be over with but he said if it's
[17:24] time to write it then it' be another
[17:25] book of Acts written behind this church
[17:28] right well I don't see
[17:29] nothing well you know what you've been
[17:31] the same way right I've got takes in my
[17:36] uh truck and I got you know in the car
[17:38] and everything and a lot of times I just
[17:41] keep playing that same tape well you
[17:43] know I hear Brother random I've heard
[17:44] him probably 30 times lately talking
[17:47] about
[17:48] that he said you can go
[17:51] overseas and he said there'll be
[17:55] 30,000 hundreds of thousands come to me
[17:59] he said and come back here he said
[18:01] standing out in the hot sun and you know
[18:04] everything all day he said crowded
[18:07] around him at the airport that they had
[18:08] to take the militia to be able to get
[18:10] him in and
[18:11] out to just to get to hear about Jesus
[18:14] Christ he said in here you can take the
[18:17] finest buildings a great comfort of the
[18:19] pews and said it's hard to get people
[18:22] coming said if they do they kind of oh
[18:24] well that's pretty
[18:27] good you
[18:29] know it's kind of like brother Mo
[18:31] brother Tatum telling me about a woman
[18:35] preacher that was in this message that
[18:38] years ago and said they asked her you
[18:40] know kind of what she thought about
[18:42] brother R's Ministry that was good but
[18:44] said seem better than my
[18:48] own well you know something to that
[18:51] degree you know I don't believe it amen
[18:54] if I'd been there I wouldn't have
[18:55] believed it right I would have just said
[18:59] H they don't need me listening to you I
[19:01] say if you do bore me because it's not
[19:05] true see we believe the prophet spoke of
[19:07] an end time
[19:09] bride I believe God is revealing his
[19:12] word around the worlden and getting a
[19:15] bride ready against that day yeah but I
[19:19] w't see signs and wonders if you back
[19:21] there you'd want to see signs and
[19:23] wonders open your eyes God is doing
[19:26] things there's been enough healing right
[19:28] here Among Us in the past 3 months to be
[19:31] able to see that God still Is A Healer
[19:33] that's right that's right right
[19:36] amen you said well you know no we never
[19:39] will see the day like brother randam in
[19:41] the in the doings cuz that's over with
[19:43] that's right it's not made for the
[19:45] Gentiles the next Revival is to the Jews
[19:49] after we get out of here but that's no
[19:51] reason not to believe that we're in a
[19:54] Revival I'm in a Revival every day when
[19:56] I read God's word and I hear that that
[19:58] Prophet as he begins to expound upon
[20:01] these
[20:02] things and to see the word of God
[20:04] revealed that's my
[20:06] Revival I don't know what you're looking
[20:08] for amen I just know one thing for sure
[20:11] I'm going to make this statement quick
[20:14] if you can't see God now living and
[20:17] doing then you couldn't see him no worth
[20:19] El that's amen that's that's just the
[20:22] plainest can be the dead could be raised
[20:25] the sick could be healed and you'd never
[20:27] see it
[20:29] but if you're not ordained to see it you
[20:30] won't see
[20:32] it so then I'd say as far as I'm
[20:34] concerned that's what I don't understand
[20:36] about people people say I don't believe
[20:40] soone what you want to say as far as I'm
[20:43] concerned cuz you're trying to make it
[20:45] look like everybody you remember brother
[20:47] Bram got a letter saying we don't want
[20:50] you over here something like Africa
[20:53] thing
[20:54] right he checked in to come find out
[20:56] that we was one man
[21:00] well you know the the letter says we
[21:04] right well we're just sit down on our
[21:06] own s and do whatever but now
[21:11] listen see then in
[21:13] seeing what the prophet said see
[21:15] actually chapter 5 is you and I
[21:18] rejoicing in heaven amen now if you get
[21:20] in your seal book you'll find this quote
[21:23] brother ROM is referring to and I invite
[21:25] you to read the seals
[21:29] if you want to start on the first seal
[21:32] and and go through I wish you would
[21:34] though we pretty well we covered up into
[21:36] the breach and that way when I make a
[21:39] statement you I read that I read that
[21:42] see all right see then brother random in
[21:45] the breach would say this is the opening
[21:48] of the
[21:50] seals then you'll hear him over like in
[21:52] the first seal he'll say
[21:56] John was
[22:00] rejoicing you remember
[22:03] that you remember where there in chapter
[22:05] 5 where he says you know all in Heaven
[22:08] and Earth heard me saying heard I
[22:11] saying brother R said must have seen his
[22:13] name under there when one of the seals
[22:16] broke amen
[22:19] [Music]
[22:21] right he said one of the seals broke
[22:24] back there to who was it that Elijah
[22:27] that said
[22:28] you know am I left alone and the Lord
[22:31] opened one of the seals and showed him
[22:33] there
[22:34] 7,000
[22:35] Believers but see we look at the seals
[22:38] is no it's got to be this it's got to be
[22:39] that it's got to be this it's got to be
[22:41] that and that's what we want to get to
[22:43] today I want to drive it down and then
[22:45] we'll move on and get over into the
[22:47] seals of what our understanding is but
[22:50] you say well how could the seals be
[22:52] opening in chapter 5 because you're
[22:54] there
[22:56] right I made that emphasis over and over
[22:59] two or three messages that the prophet
[23:01] said you are the
[23:02] book and when the book was sealed he
[23:04] said you're sealed with the book right
[23:07] right you see with the book he
[23:11] said when the book is revealed to Israel
[23:14] what are they going to
[23:17] see now come on what is Israel going to
[23:21] see well they'll see just put it down a
[23:25] nutshell what's Israel going to see
[23:30] they're going to see they crucified him
[23:32] right and they'll press in the hands
[23:34] which we know that's not physical so
[23:36] they're going to preach enough to them
[23:38] until they realize that they were the
[23:40] ones that crucified Christ right
[23:43] right that's right but when they go away
[23:46] and mourn for them mourning you know
[23:49] crying out
[23:51] weeping it's like a trying to emphasize
[23:54] a point they know then they missed the
[23:57] right of
[24:00] sunship that's why they're weeping and
[24:03] mourning sure brother killing of Jesus
[24:07] Christ but when they find out that they
[24:10] missed this
[24:12] thing because of the leaders of that
[24:15] day they missed the
[24:18] Messiah right and they're going to
[24:21] realize they missed the ride of sun and
[24:22] ship
[24:24] right God won't take them back as bride
[24:28] you can argue that point all you want to
[24:30] you ain't going to be in the Bible the
[24:31] prophet's
[24:33] message they become servants they'll
[24:36] always be servants 144,000 will be in
[24:39] the millennial right servants to the
[24:44] bride they'll never be nothing but
[24:46] servants why they rejected the ride of
[24:49] sunship Amen right all right now in
[24:53] doing that
[24:55] then they're going to see that you
[24:57] accepted
[24:59] sunship
[25:02] amen come on they're going to see that
[25:05] you the
[25:07] bride accepted the right of sunship and
[25:10] that you went through all of these
[25:12] things and now you come up into heaven
[25:14] in a Rapture go remember the prophet
[25:16] said
[25:18] what John going up to Revelations 4:1 is
[25:21] the top of the
[25:23] Rapture all right then if that be true
[25:27] then
[25:28] we're not there when the seals literally
[25:30] open to
[25:32] Israel you
[25:34] agree I certainly don't want to be there
[25:36] when the SI six seal takes place to you
[25:39] that's right so if you want to be here
[25:40] to 1 2 3 4 why don't you hang around for
[25:43] 5 six and seven see you want to divide
[25:45] that up and think well I got a quote
[25:48] here that brother R said the rde goes up
[25:50] four seal I agree with
[25:54] you that's 100% correct
[25:58] but you better believe that the four
[26:00] seal is armag get
[26:04] right are you going to be here at armag
[26:09] again come
[26:13] on he didn't just like this statement he
[26:16] makes here it needs
[26:18] Clarity it needs understanding right
[26:22] amen then in the fifth chapter of the
[26:25] Book of Revelations the seals actually
[26:27] broke
[26:29] why because the lamb took the
[26:32] book
[26:34] right he stands with it in chapter 61
[26:38] and
[26:40] unfolds all
[26:42] right
[26:44] now so let's lay down some points and
[26:46] then I'll get to the question that
[26:48] hinges right there on that point go
[26:50] ahead with number three
[26:54] brother look what your Prophet has to
[26:56] say on Gabriel's instruction to Daniel
[26:59] 1961 7:30 morning
[27:03] service just getting what's underlined
[27:06] you read the rest of it I gave you the
[27:07] quote okay to where you can read it but
[27:09] look what's underlined the Seven Seals
[27:11] seven plagu seven wo seven trumpets has
[27:14] not one thing to do back up let's read
[27:17] that it has nothing to do with the
[27:20] church you know nothing to do with the
[27:22] Gentiles these seven Church Seven Seals
[27:24] seven plx seven wo seven trumpets as not
[27:27] one thing to do the Gentile church will
[27:29] be in glory at that
[27:32] time don't have nothing to do with us
[27:35] the Gentile Church it only deals with
[27:37] Israel Daniel thy people and
[27:42] Jerusalem
[27:44] now so we're going to go down through
[27:46] some quotes but to make a
[27:52] point see then from Revelations 4:1 to
[27:56] 19:21 has nothing to do with the bride
[27:59] of Jesus
[28:03] Christ automatically you run up with the
[28:06] question what about re you mean
[28:08] Revelation 10:7 Revelation 10:7 got to
[28:10] go to Israel
[28:12] right didn't brother Brown say I always
[28:14] thought I had would have something to do
[28:17] with the Jews receiving the gospel amen
[28:21] and you know he will that's right you
[28:24] know why cuz it'll be his message
[28:28] not
[28:29] him and certainly not like a man years
[28:32] ago that we were up there at Gainesville
[28:35] and he was teaching he said or told it
[28:37] that you don't believe that two prophets
[28:39] could be a gentile bride and
[28:42] a and a gentile prophet of course you
[28:45] know who he was talking about being the
[28:47] Gentile Prophet was him all right but
[28:51] see that's where people try to figure
[28:53] things out instead of leaving it alone
[28:57] that's right letting the Holy Spirit
[28:59] bring it to a place so the bride goes up
[29:02] in Revelations
[29:04] 4:1 he said but what about Revelations
[29:07] 10
[29:08] brother we see you're messing up on 101
[29:11] anyway cuz brother R said 101 and this a
[29:13] direct quote he said 101 was the same as
[29:15] Revelation 1
[29:19] 13 now I didn't say that he
[29:21] did Revelation 13 is what one standing
[29:24] in the midst of seven golden can La un
[29:27] the son of a man G about the
[29:29] PS femish the
[29:32] bride you hear a lot about 107 but you
[29:35] don't hear
[29:38] 101 we just read
[29:41] 10:7 why did John after all the bringing
[29:44] what he's doing and all at once he
[29:48] said comes to the Thunders in verse four
[29:52] I mean verse six we run through there of
[29:55] the 10th
[29:56] chapter but then all at once he said but
[29:59] in the days of the seventh
[30:03] angel I don't put him over there that
[30:07] puts his message over there going to
[30:08] Israel but in the days of the seventh
[30:10] angel that's where he's at that's right
[30:13] he's the seventh angel to the seventh
[30:15] Church age
[30:17] right and see it be his message it'll go
[30:20] to Israel because it'll be his message
[30:22] that describes cuz he was the one that
[30:24] described that the Jews would be
[30:29] rejected that's where we got the
[30:31] understanding the Jews would reject the
[30:32] gospel or did reject it and won't be no
[30:36] nowh that they will actually return his
[30:39] sunship but they return his servants see
[30:42] his M why his message is the entire
[30:44] Bible right right come on that's the
[30:47] prophet's message we to take all the
[30:49] loose ends of the Bible that was left
[30:51] things that was not understood by
[30:54] man and reveal it unto you and I oh yeah
[30:58] Str ask the question now who broke the
[31:06] seals if you say brother brand broke the
[31:09] seals then you're deity that's right mhm
[31:13] sorry I'm blunt with you you be blunt
[31:16] with me oh yeah people say I don't agree
[31:18] with you well that's blunt ain't it well
[31:21] I just tell you where I stand and at
[31:23] least then you don't wonder what I'm
[31:25] talking about that's right
[31:28] you can see it right up front what I'm
[31:30] saying but you better believe one thing
[31:32] I'm saying what he said here let's come
[31:35] on let's see you say it that way and
[31:36] bring it some other
[31:37] way see but but in the days of the voice
[31:40] of the seventh angel see John comes
[31:42] writing he's writing he's writing he's
[31:44] writing and then he sees the the
[31:46] chapters the five and then six and seven
[31:49] 8 and
[31:51] nine and he wonders how in the world can
[31:53] I get this to the church cu come on was
[31:55] not John commanded in the first chapter
[31:57] to write these things down and bring it
[32:00] to the
[32:01] church he said how can I get it back
[32:06] there he said but in the days let me
[32:08] paraphrase it and change a wording and
[32:11] let you
[32:12] listen but in the days of the Prophet
[32:16] that will come in the seventh Church
[32:19] age to bring the word unto
[32:22] us the mysteries of God would be
[32:26] revealed
[32:27] M did I change to Revelations
[32:30] 10:7 no put it down in plain
[32:33] language of where we're at what we're
[32:35] doing yeah you said well what about 184
[32:39] come out of her my people well how you
[32:41] come out of the denomination that's
[32:43] right right come
[32:47] on see what we're missing church is what
[32:50] I've tried to drive and I want to drive
[32:51] it home today cuz it keeps burying on me
[32:54] so maybe it's me that don't understand
[32:56] so you sit and listen while I preach to
[32:57] me
[33:01] okay see this message is the complete
[33:05] Plan of
[33:06] Redemption this message this Prophet
[33:09] brought us the complete Plan of
[33:12] Redemption there's no loins in it it's
[33:15] all perfect right even showing us the
[33:18] future home showing us all of the things
[33:21] down Through the Ages that we would not
[33:23] dare to touch while we were among the
[33:25] denominations and things
[33:29] but yet his message brought us the
[33:31] truth and we'll be judged by it too
[33:34] because we've heard it
[33:37] amen see then we want to try to take
[33:40] something like place it like I told you
[33:42] I got into a discussion with some
[33:44] ministers over this
[33:45] point and they were saying well the Book
[33:47] of Revelation is not in chronological
[33:49] order I challenge you on brother Brown's
[33:51] message but you go find that for me you
[33:54] find me where brother Brown said it's
[33:56] not in chronological IC
[33:59] order come on people don't like that cuz
[34:01] I'm sarcastic I know
[34:04] it if that means sarcastic to just try
[34:06] to tell somebody the truth and stand on
[34:08] it and say show
[34:11] me I thought brother R said he' be glad
[34:13] when somebody look him in the eye and
[34:14] say you're not saying what Paul said
[34:16] right well I think it's time to look
[34:18] people in the eye and say you're not
[34:19] saying what brother rold
[34:25] said that way with stand on the message
[34:28] mhm I've got to face God for what I
[34:30] preached to you that's right am but you
[34:32] got to face God for what he preached to
[34:35] you want you
[34:38] hear but you see we say it's not in
[34:41] chronological order brother said the D
[34:43] in the buts was in perfect place that's
[34:45] right right I want you to show me where
[34:47] brother around said the Book of
[34:48] Revelation is not in
[34:53] order do you don't have any quotes for
[34:56] it that's your supposed idea because
[34:59] you're trying to say this ought to be
[35:01] over here this ought to be over here and
[35:02] this ought to be over there don't you
[35:04] leave it
[35:08] alone why don't you believe what he said
[35:12] amen the seals is the entire Bible right
[35:16] right reveal what has was what is what
[35:18] shall be
[35:19] right the complete Plan of Redemption
[35:22] was brought through those
[35:24] seals then why can't we just sit down
[35:27] and say well wait a minute I don't
[35:29] understand it we're facing that about
[35:31] the Daniel 70 weeks brother Brown said
[35:34] Daniel 70 weeks was a parable that's
[35:36] what's going to be in the next
[35:37] ministry's meeting you know what a
[35:39] parable is you know that
[35:42] Jesus never spoke to mankind without a
[35:45] parable the Bible says right without a
[35:49] parable spake he not unto them that it
[35:52] might be
[35:53] fulfilled in Parables he spoke the
[35:56] things things right M you know what a
[36:00] parable
[36:01] is brother R said God done it this way
[36:05] to where he keep the church
[36:10] watching right come on keep the church
[36:13] waiting see if we have known it's going
[36:16] to be on a certain certain date I don't
[36:18] care what you think we'd become lazy
[36:20] shiftless bums because that's what
[36:22] happened right but that's what happened
[36:24] to the people of the message cuz it
[36:26] didn't happen
[36:27] 73 they went down it didn't happen in 77
[36:30] they went lower didn't happen in 80 you
[36:32] know 6 and all like that they went lower
[36:34] didn't happen in the year 2000 boy they
[36:36] really slump down
[36:39] now you know they demoted because they I
[36:44] can't figure it
[36:46] out there's no way to figure it out
[36:49] right my brother ROM said it's written
[36:51] in Parables that you can't figure it out
[36:55] am and it would take a
[36:58] prophet to explain The Parables right
[37:02] right
[37:04] right mankind can't understand Jesus
[37:07] never spoke to them without a
[37:09] parable brother R's message is a
[37:16] parable same book Daniel
[37:19] 76 he said Jesus was crucified in
[37:24] ad30 two or three paragraphs later he
[37:27] said Jesus was crucified in
[37:32] ad33 you know that's exactly
[37:37] right well how could that be cuz one of
[37:41] them's 30 other's
[37:45] 33 according to our calendar that we
[37:48] started off with a
[37:50] one Jesus was crucified in
[37:54] 33 but according to where our calendar
[37:57] should have
[37:59] started Jesus was born in 4
[38:02] BC that would make him being crucified
[38:04] in
[38:05] ad30 the brother R is exactly
[38:09] right simple techn simple terminology
[38:12] right if you
[38:15] understand but you see church that's
[38:17] what we need we need a revelation
[38:20] right but you know what I love about R
[38:23] random is what as he was and what he
[38:24] would bring you know he'd say now
[38:27] I don't believe that the bride's going
[38:28] through the tribulation I'm paraphrasing
[38:30] the quote but I find it for you he said
[38:34] I don't believe the bride is going to go
[38:35] through the
[38:36] tribulation but he said where she goes
[38:38] up before or after I just want to go up
[38:41] with her right amen now that's how
[38:44] wonderful a man could talk that could
[38:46] stand there with thus sayith the
[38:49] Lord
[38:53] right but yet he saying wherever it goes
[38:56] I want to go up with
[38:59] it there's what we need
[39:03] right that reminds me of what I've been
[39:05] doing I've been praying for a
[39:08] Revival I told you about it for 2 years
[39:10] now I've been praying for a
[39:12] Revival in this church we're not all
[39:15] over the world in this
[39:17] church and you know what a Revival is
[39:19] going to bring it's going to bring some
[39:22] people in but it's going to take out a
[39:24] lot of people that's right
[39:27] sure
[39:29] will the achens can't stay with a
[39:34] Revival see I realize that but i' I've
[39:37] got to preach it and believe it I'm
[39:39] praying for a Revival I'm praying for a
[39:41] house
[39:44] cleaning
[39:46] right you might order to look under your
[39:49] seat you might find a prayer CLW stuck
[39:52] under
[39:55] there you remember
[39:58] that that I put a PR cloth under a
[40:00] Brother's seat and about a month or so
[40:03] later he was gone from
[40:05] here you might order look under your
[40:08] seat you might find one of course the
[40:11] way you juggle around sometimes I have
[40:13] to put them if I did put them there I'd
[40:15] have to put them under every one of them
[40:18] cuz the way you juggle around you know
[40:19] and sit in different places you I'm
[40:23] making a joke on this truth I'm praying
[40:25] for house cleaning starting in the pull
[40:31] pit a
[40:34] Revival cuz that bride the brother R
[40:36] said it take those seven unknown
[40:37] Thunders to wake her up is that what he
[40:41] said so I believe we're in the end to
[40:43] don't you why can't I pray for a Revival
[40:46] I ain't praying for a worldwide sweeping
[40:47] Revival I'm praying for a Revival in
[40:49] this
[40:52] church everybody else got to pray for
[40:54] their own get back to the point get know
[40:57] I get to preach and I get off in the
[40:58] point
[40:59] okay so now let's just
[41:03] prove that from Revelations 4:1 to 19:21
[41:08] that the bride is not seen on Earth is
[41:11] that what your Prophet to
[41:13] say she goes up in 41 and not seen to
[41:17] 1921 he call it 21 but you go over look
[41:20] at your scriptures about 14 15 where
[41:22] it's come back in the Millennium you
[41:25] know
[41:28] what do you believe
[41:30] that well brother D how do we get to se
[41:36] those oh praise God who broke the seals
[41:38] come on and when it it
[41:40] break come on according to my Bible and
[41:45] according to your
[41:48] Prophet the seals broke 2,000 years ago
[41:52] right yes
[41:54] sir that's right
[42:00] amen see that's where people can't
[42:02] follow brother
[42:05] Brown they think the seals broke that he
[42:08] broke the
[42:13] seals no he's not the
[42:17] lamb the lamb broke the seil right
[42:21] that's
[42:23] right you see then where we're putting
[42:25] it
[42:27] all right well let's get the point and
[42:29] drive this down and then
[42:31] we'll finish our thought look at the
[42:34] next one number four brother this is the
[42:36] paragraph 193 of the 70th week of Daniel
[42:40] now reading I'm to say this because
[42:43] sometimes you miss what said uh when
[42:46] they put the 2010 version up they called
[42:49] it the 70th week of Daniel for some
[42:50] reason I don't know why it is not that
[42:53] in your book it is called a 70 weeks of
[42:55] Daniel
[42:58] it's not called the 70th week of
[43:01] Daniel see they Chang those things I'm
[43:04] just telling you those things you go
[43:05] home and say well he he don't even know
[43:06] what he's talking about because my book
[43:08] says 70 weeks of
[43:10] Daniel well that's the new 2010 version
[43:13] they brought out okay so paragraph 133
[43:16] says 193 excuse me says
[43:19] what now that we see now and all this
[43:24] now that we see will help us by his
[43:26] grace as we Endeavor to approach these
[43:29] last seven seals now this is over in the
[43:31] 70 weeks of Daniel right he's getting
[43:33] prepared remember that's a preparation
[43:36] see where we' have missed it from
[43:38] Revelation 6:1 to 1921 we would have
[43:42] missed it because see we we have been
[43:45] trying to apply it back there in this
[43:48] Gentile age where you see it's over in
[43:51] this age it's over to
[43:55] Israel
[43:58] see church I've tried to explain it to
[44:01] you for 40 years the actual seal itself
[44:04] breaks to Israel when we leave brother R
[44:07] asked in the question does second
[44:10] Thessalonians the man of sin sit in
[44:11] Temple Of God fulfill the first seal and
[44:13] he says
[44:15] yes that was on your questions and
[44:17] answers on the
[44:19] seals but you see we get all confused
[44:21] about what's this what's that just look
[44:23] at your
[44:25] Bible
[44:30] look at the Bible and read it read your
[44:32] prophet's message all
[44:35] right look what he goes on now bringing
[44:37] these day up up okay taking sides with
[44:40] Jesus number
[44:42] five which we realize in Revelation is
[44:44] just 1 2 three chapters to the church
[44:47] the church goes up in the fourth chapter
[44:49] it does not return anymore till the 19th
[44:52] Chapter that's after the tribulation
[44:54] period when God calls out the Jews okay
[44:59] keep on going number six the
[45:02] breach paragraph 23 now now we're going
[45:06] to turn to the fifth chapter now this is
[45:08] not the Seven Seals it is the breach
[45:11] between the church ages and the Seven
[45:12] Seals now there is also a sixth chapter
[45:15] and there was a fourth chapter rather
[45:17] Revelation and that it kind of reveals
[45:20] something that would take place after
[45:21] the church going up that the church goes
[45:24] up on the third chapter of Revelations
[45:27] what end of the verse right end of the
[45:29] chapter third
[45:30] chapter all
[45:32] right and does not return until the 19th
[45:36] Chapter of Revelation see therefore the
[45:38] church misses the tribulation now we're
[45:40] great to to want to quote and understand
[45:43] that we miss the
[45:45] tribulation but how do you know you're
[45:48] going to miss the
[45:50] tribulation because the church goes up
[45:54] right but we Glory we're not going
[45:57] through tribulation but we don't well I
[45:58] don't understand where we go up or what
[46:00] we do we just we just miss the
[46:02] tribulation well that's what your
[46:04] Prophet come to
[46:05] explain look at the next one paragraph
[46:08] 194 the four
[46:11] seal watch rides a pale horse as he
[46:14] appears on his ride this last ride he's
[46:18] on his last ride now that is not in our
[46:22] day that will be on down it's the still
[46:26] foretold because the church has done
[46:29] gone up when this
[46:37] happens paper is stuck together look at
[46:40] the next one fifth seal just going right
[46:43] on through the
[46:45] message paragraph 87 the fifth
[46:48] seal that's the reason that he reveals
[46:51] that as I understand that it is because
[46:53] the mystery of the book of redemption as
[46:55] far as the Antichrist being revealed and
[46:58] at the same time the church is gone and
[47:00] these things don't even happen in the
[47:02] church age at all that's right that
[47:04] they're away from the church age the
[47:06] church age absolutely the church
[47:08] absolutely is raptured at this time the
[47:11] church goes up at the fourth chapter of
[47:13] Revelation and does not return again
[47:15] return until it comes back with with its
[47:18] king in the 19th Chapter but these seals
[47:20] are revealing what has been what is and
[47:23] what will be now that we what has to be
[47:26] for the church age was revealed by these
[47:29] seals right go on to the next paragraph
[47:33] 218 now these cannot be them Souls
[47:37] because the The Souls of of the
[47:39] righteous martyr and the righteous
[47:42] people the church the bride has done
[47:44] been took up so they wouldn't be under
[47:46] the altar they'd be in glory with the
[47:49] bride see now watch they are gone in the
[47:51] Rapture on the fourth chapter of
[47:53] Revelation they was taken up and who are
[47:56] these Souls then what is it that's the
[47:59] next thing who are they if they're not
[48:01] the early church it is Israel that to be
[48:03] saved as a nation so you it right on
[48:06] over look at the Sixth
[48:09] Seal paragraph 67 now we're living in a
[48:13] terrific
[48:14] time the that that that you see these
[48:17] things that we're in now and we're
[48:20] studying right now is after the church
[48:23] is done gone see these things are the
[48:25] tribulation period 6 SE paragraph
[48:30] 190 now God is not dealing with the
[48:33] church no more it's done been gone he's
[48:35] dealing with Israel see this is the
[48:38] other side talking about Israel and
[48:39] they're doing right Feast of the
[48:43] trumpets 1964 719 the morning service
[48:47] paragraph
[48:48] 36 and paragraph
[48:51] 37 the first three chapters of the Book
[48:54] of Revelation reveal all that happen
[48:55] happenings unto the church then from the
[48:57] third chapter into the 19th Chapter of
[48:59] Revelation there is no more scene of the
[49:01] church the church goes up at the 4th
[49:03] chapter of Revelation and returns back
[49:05] at the 19th Chapter of Revelation the
[49:08] bride and the groom together going to
[49:11] the coming to the Earth and then from
[49:13] the 19th Chapter to the conclusive of
[49:16] the 22nd chapter it's all on the
[49:18] Millennium and what be in the be will be
[49:21] in the years that is to follow it during
[49:24] the 4th to the 19th God is dealing with
[49:28] Israel
[49:30] right God is dealing with Israel during
[49:32] that
[49:34] time we're not
[49:37] there you said well what about it
[49:39] brother
[49:42] D what are you trying to show
[49:45] us the seals broke 2,000 years
[49:49] ago the Bible
[49:54] says
[49:56] that was in
[49:58] glory cuz that's where we're
[50:02] at the actual opening of the first seal
[50:04] is not the manifestation of the man of
[50:08] sin is not until we get out of here you
[50:10] agree with that that's
[50:15] right leave in
[50:19] church we're in the time of the opening
[50:22] of the seals to the
[50:24] bride are the revealing of the seals to
[50:29] the the making known of what those
[50:32] things are we'll start this afternoon
[50:34] Lord willing back pick up the Deeds
[50:37] Doctrine Etc and bring it
[50:40] out the down to the
[50:43] Antichrist cu the first seal is what the
[50:46] Antichrist that's right no the first
[50:50] seal is a revelation of Jesus
[50:53] Christ the Antichrist is what you see in
[50:55] in opposition you better read your seal
[50:59] book and then when you read that seal
[51:01] book listen to the things brother around
[51:03] said he said look at that fell look at
[51:05] that guy look at this person going the
[51:07] other
[51:09] way and you'll see that he's talking
[51:12] about the man of sin the
[51:17] Antichrist we're in the days when things
[51:20] are transpiring we are the bride of
[51:22] Christ we're not here in the tribulation
[51:25] yet we know what's going to happen in
[51:26] the
[51:28] tribulation we're not here at the battle
[51:31] of Armageddon and the physical point
[51:33] because we done go in the
[51:39] Rapture but my point is who opened the
[51:47] seal I thought the lamb opened the
[51:50] seal I didn't know it was brother Rand
[51:52] had open the
[51:54] seal
[51:56] he didn't open any seal he just spoke
[51:58] what God told him about it that's
[52:01] right he come back from Arizona the Lord
[52:04] had done spoke to him I D to go home
[52:08] right it'll be told to you about the
[52:11] seals he comes back to
[52:14] the and saids I don't know what that
[52:16] first seal
[52:21] is a brother Dale you don't understand
[52:23] he knew well he said didn't that's right
[52:27] and now where we're going to cross at is
[52:29] right here cuz he said on that first
[52:32] seal he said I have made a horrible
[52:35] mistake
[52:38] right if the Holy Spirit had not come in
[52:41] corrected he because I was going to
[52:43] preach what I previously preached you
[52:46] know what he previously preached that's
[52:49] why was right or was the Holy
[52:54] Ghost but you see he didn't understand
[52:56] until the Holy Spirit met him in the
[52:58] room he was fixing to come out and
[52:59] preach that
[53:01] wrong now that's his
[53:05] word I've had people say well you know
[53:08] about different things about the message
[53:10] and they say well that's just to deceive
[53:13] you what he said it like that well he
[53:17] done a good job matching up the
[53:19] Bible and bringing things out to really
[53:22] deceive a lot of people amen
[53:26] you know and who's going to be the one
[53:28] to figure out what's right and what's
[53:31] wrong well this is the way I believe it
[53:35] okay you're American citizen you got a
[53:39] right but being a Christian you don't
[53:41] have a
[53:43] right Christians don't have
[53:50] rights that's what me and my wife
[53:52] talking about yesterday I don't
[53:54] understand the people people of this
[53:56] message they can just make up anything
[53:58] in the world and people just run for it
[54:00] and flop after it any kind of a Doctrine
[54:03] any kind of an idea that's right and yet
[54:05] every one of them claims to have of the
[54:06] Holy
[54:09] Ghost right right you ever heard a
[54:12] preacher say he didn't have the Holy
[54:15] Ghost you ever talk to anybody about a
[54:17] doctrine that they tell you this one I
[54:19] believe I don't have the Holy Ghost no
[54:22] people don't talk like that do they
[54:29] see Church who broke those
[54:33] seals making it the way that the biggest
[54:35] portion of the people of the mess it but
[54:37] around
[54:39] broke but according to the
[54:42] Bible the lamb broke the
[54:44] seal right according to brother randam
[54:47] on the first seal he said the lamb and
[54:50] God and the Holy
[54:52] Ghost all is what he said the S same
[54:59] person well the lamb was the only one
[55:01] that could break the seal but now I will
[55:03] go on further to S
[55:06] you your same Prophet also said that
[55:09] Jesus Christ did reveal anything to you
[55:12] he said it takes a father to
[55:17] reveal Hallelujah it takes the Holy
[55:20] Ghost to
[55:22] reveal so even though the lamb took the
[55:24] cover off the book 2,000 years
[55:31] ago it couldn't be comprehended
[55:36] right right that's right so when the
[55:39] prophet came did the prophet break the
[55:41] seals or did the lamb break the
[55:50] seal it's like I told you I didn't
[55:53] finish that message y the the other week
[55:56] sister Gail said you spoke to her heart
[55:57] this morning to her head this afternoon
[56:01] it was all
[56:02] right I was simply making a
[56:06] point brother around said you can call
[56:08] him Jesus
[56:09] Jesus and be worshiping the
[56:13] devil you know that's a
[56:18] quote now is a denominational Doctrine
[56:20] right no well then if you believe a
[56:23] denominational Doctrine then you're
[56:26] worshiping
[56:28] Satan is that
[56:31] simple yes but brother Dale we I know it
[56:34] and God went to their ignorance
[56:37] true but then sent somebody along like
[56:40] me to be sturing and hateful enough to
[56:42] tell you or to ask
[56:46] you would your Revelation go to Israel
[56:50] and convert the
[56:52] Jews they certainly wouldn't listen the
[56:55] two souls and two Lords and all of those
[56:57] doctrines that's in the message Jesus
[56:59] wouldn't go out till the River Jordan
[57:01] you remember what that man said to the
[57:04] rabbi when brother around asked him
[57:05] about Jes he said he's that he said
[57:07] Isaiah he said that'll be the
[57:10] Messiah he said will the Messiah be God
[57:12] he said yes
[57:15] right and then we look up and try to
[57:17] divide him he said don't you talk to
[57:19] them about that he said because they'll
[57:22] show you right where that Doctrine came
[57:24] from that's right well why can't we show
[57:26] the people of the message right where
[57:28] their Doctrine came
[57:31] from Brother Brown said a trinity came
[57:34] out of the pits of hell now that's my
[57:35] word not my words that's your Prophet
[57:40] right and see if you believe it that's
[57:42] where you
[57:44] going but brother Dale only doctor there
[57:47] such wonderful brothers you need the
[57:49] baptism of the Holy
[57:51] Ghost amen right you got to baptism of
[57:55] the Holy Ghost he ain't going to let you
[57:57] be deceived you might get a little
[57:58] confused
[58:01] yeah you might have problems yes right
[58:05] but you won't be
[58:09] deceived people say well I know all
[58:12] along that doctor that man had would
[58:14] right and you sat there and listen to
[58:20] it I didn't make the statement you did
[58:23] so you condemned your own
[58:25] that's it you said I know all on that
[58:27] went right well why didn't you get up
[58:29] and leave amen well brother D can't do
[58:32] that we got to go church
[58:34] somewhere well get out and find one or
[58:37] start you
[58:39] one you can't find it start one preach
[58:43] the
[58:46] truth well you're just trying to build a
[58:49] church up now I'm trying to EMP it cuz
[58:51] we don't get we're not full today but
[58:55] when everybody's here we're full I'm
[58:57] trying to empty some seats but now you
[59:00] know better than that cuz you know the
[59:01] way I preach and what I mean I would to
[59:04] God we had to build 10 times this
[59:06] building right for people that want to
[59:08] hear the truth but I ain't got no time
[59:10] to argue and fuss with nobody about the
[59:12] little pity Patty quotes or thoughts
[59:14] that they got well I think this is it
[59:18] brother brother said that's what he done
[59:19] in the
[59:20] garden said she took her own ideas and
[59:22] said I think mhm back to what I said you
[59:25] say well I can't think if you're a
[59:28] Christian you
[59:30] can't anybody want to argue that quote
[59:33] if you're a Christian you can't have
[59:35] your own
[59:37] ideas now show me in the Bible I'm
[59:40] wrong is that a right statement if you
[59:43] got the Holy Ghost you can only be led
[59:45] by the Holy Ghost right
[59:47] true I thought we believe the Holy Ghost
[59:49] would lead us to the
[59:53] truth
[59:55] the church who broke the seals who
[59:57] opened that's what I asked the question
[59:59] who opened those
[1:00:01] seals the way most people think brother
[1:00:03] brandom
[1:00:07] did no they was open to John on patas
[1:00:11] mhm put in a
[1:00:14] church
[1:00:18] symbol
[1:00:21] why why was it put the church symbol
[1:00:24] your Prophet said it was to keep the
[1:00:27] church
[1:00:30] waiting had he wrote it down to Rapture
[1:00:32] is going to come in a certain certain
[1:00:37] dat come on you know yourself we just be
[1:00:40] relaxed and shess along well it don't
[1:00:43] matter that's next week I got a whole
[1:00:46] week to get ready for the Rapture yeah
[1:00:49] that's what we do M the first Seal white
[1:00:52] horse rider i r said John saw it in a
[1:00:56] symbol mhm but the seal was
[1:01:03] broke the lamb broke
[1:01:06] it but when it was sent down to man it
[1:01:09] was sent in a
[1:01:12] symol God knowing that in the end time
[1:01:15] there would come a
[1:01:16] prophet that would take them
[1:01:19] symbols and break them to the
[1:01:22] church now what if he did never preach
[1:01:25] 1 2 3 4
[1:01:27] 5 what if he' never preached those
[1:01:31] things and he walked out there and he
[1:01:33] said I want you all to know my
[1:01:35] Revelation this is the
[1:01:38] Antichrist you had no Foundation to base
[1:01:41] anything
[1:01:42] upon you would have been taken his
[1:01:45] word
[1:01:47] right but he preached all of those years
[1:01:49] getting us
[1:01:53] ready I'm talking about right now to get
[1:01:55] us
[1:01:58] ready to work and understand the
[1:02:02] symbol brother R said that was a
[1:02:06] white righteous
[1:02:11] Church a beautiful CH church that the
[1:02:15] Bible says John admired it that's what
[1:02:20] scripture
[1:02:22] say a beautiful Church system look at it
[1:02:27] today feeding the
[1:02:30] poor hospitals they got that's right I'm
[1:02:34] talking churches is doing all these
[1:02:37] things putting out the the tracks
[1:02:40] putting out going all over the
[1:02:42] world missionaries
[1:02:44] today not for just this message
[1:02:47] missionaries from Methodist Baptist and
[1:02:49] all that that's poverty stricken that
[1:02:51] have nothing to eat hardly themselves
[1:02:53] but out there on the feet
[1:02:55] trying their best get people to see
[1:02:58] God no wonder brother around called it a
[1:03:01] white church he said it was pure and
[1:03:06] clean but what about a pure and clean
[1:03:11] church when the head of it is the
[1:03:15] Antichrist what good does it do to be
[1:03:17] the white clean
[1:03:19] church if the Antichrist is
[1:03:22] head that's right right
[1:03:24] so that's the way we're going to go
[1:03:25] through the seals just take it just just
[1:03:27] you read the seals and let's go through
[1:03:29] it and just talk about the things I've
[1:03:30] done it in 79 and I'm interested in
[1:03:33] getting back into it again and not just
[1:03:36] try to deal with a seal or this that but
[1:03:38] to deal with what God
[1:03:42] reveals you ever notice in your s see go
[1:03:45] back and read it see if I'm
[1:03:46] right brother Ram
[1:03:52] spoke and he went stop the tape and
[1:03:54] wouldn't let it out he went home and
[1:03:58] preached what is called
[1:04:01] comments and would not release the
[1:04:04] original
[1:04:06] copy until what was it
[1:04:09] 65 after he died they released the
[1:04:13] original
[1:04:14] copy I've showed you that in the seal
[1:04:17] book right here in the church a lot of
[1:04:18] you look like you don't even know what
[1:04:20] I'm talking about but that's what he
[1:04:21] done go read your seal book it's right
[1:04:23] in the back of you tell you when did
[1:04:24] they tell you when it was
[1:04:26] released why because in his first
[1:04:30] part he called you what the see it
[1:04:34] was and the other it made it look like
[1:04:37] that he didn't
[1:04:39] know he was
[1:04:42] wondering because that was supposed to
[1:04:44] be done to keep you and I waiting and
[1:04:49] watching 40 something
[1:04:53] years that we've been watching and
[1:04:57] waiting not waiting on somebody to jump
[1:04:59] up and show how wrong brother random is
[1:05:01] like they're all doing
[1:05:12] now heard just recently but a man
[1:05:17] that say now that brother brandham had
[1:05:19] the old Catholic doctrine of believing
[1:05:22] that Jesus was crucified on Friday
[1:05:24] and raised on
[1:05:29] Sunday said he's really crucified on
[1:05:32] Wednesday that's what he said and you
[1:05:34] know what the person is so
[1:05:37] blind and I know I'm hard and hateful
[1:05:40] but so illiterate to
[1:05:43] truth until that was the Catholic
[1:05:46] Doctrine they said Jesus was crucified
[1:05:49] that's your Baptist and Methodist
[1:05:50] doctrine that Jesus was crucified on
[1:05:53] Wednesday
[1:05:54] Rose early Saturday or Saturday
[1:05:58] afternoon hung around all night Saturday

[1:07:56] see what this great Plan of Redemption

[1:07:59] done it's all hidden in this book of
[1:08:02] mystery here it's sealed with Seven
[1:08:04] Seals so the lamb is the only one who
[1:08:07] can break them that simple
[1:08:10] enough look at the next
[1:08:13] one this is the seventh seal paragraph
[1:08:17] 43 our heavenly father here comes that

[1:08:28] tonight that you'll that it'll be made
[1:08:30] known beond the shadow of it out to the
[1:08:32] people's heart and mind that they know
[1:08:35] that God is still on the throne see
[1:08:37] everybody said Redemption was over 63
[1:08:40] listen to it he still loves his people
[1:08:43] and the the hour that the world has
[1:08:45] longed to see is now approaching where
[1:08:48] it cries out for Redemption when we see
[1:08:51] the elements ready to bring it back back
[1:08:54] we see the elements ready to bring the
[1:08:55] church into the presence of Christ we
[1:08:58] see the bride taking on the form putting
[1:09:01] the wedding garment on him making ready
[1:09:03] we can see the lights are flickering we
[1:09:05] know that we're at the end now heavenly
[1:09:08] father as this goes
[1:09:10] forward now to preach or to teach on
[1:09:12] this Great Mighty event that taken place
[1:09:16] in glory some 2,000 years
[1:09:22] ago so when was the s SE
[1:09:25] broke in glory 2,000 years
[1:09:32] ago there was no
[1:09:34] symbol so John Couldn't Write it he just
[1:09:38] said silence in heaven for the space of
[1:09:40] half an hour
[1:09:41] right that's not a symbol that was just
[1:09:44] a statement L said that seven seal is
[1:09:46] not even
[1:09:48] symbol he said it's your silence in
[1:09:52] heaven
[1:09:54] but when did the s still break 2,000
[1:09:56] years
[1:09:57] ago and was given to the great beloved
[1:10:00] Apostle John and denight we're to speak
[1:10:03] on it let the Holy Spirit Come forward
[1:10:05] now his mighty power of Revelation that
[1:10:08] he might reveal to us that thing which
[1:10:10] he wants us to know as he has in the
[1:10:12] last few nights we commit ourselves to
[1:10:15] you with the word in Jesus's name amen
[1:10:18] the wind the seal bre 2,000 years
[1:10:22] ago
[1:10:26] the the lamb broke the seal left it in a
[1:10:35] symol and then the prophet was to
[1:10:39] come and he was the one to know how
[1:10:42] those symbols were and what they
[1:10:48] meant he said what about you people you
[1:10:51] doctors said explain to me why you got
[1:10:54] that sign out in the front of your
[1:10:58] office looks like a cross or a spear or
[1:11:02] something and a snake all the way around
[1:11:05] it said explain why it's
[1:11:09] there they said we don't
[1:11:13] know right ask you Doctor why is that
[1:11:16] emblem out
[1:11:18] there well it's not a
[1:11:21] healing well
[1:11:25] but how come that serpent on the
[1:11:32] pole how is a serpent on a pole a sign
[1:11:35] of
[1:11:38] healing come woman you got to go to your
[1:11:41] Prophet then
[1:11:43] right he said that said sin was
[1:11:48] judged it's why it's a snake on the pole
[1:11:52] sin was judged
[1:11:54] Ed and paid the price now what if he
[1:11:57] hadn't broke that symbol You' had a
[1:12:00] snake representing Divine
[1:12:04] Healing now how can a snake represent
[1:12:06] Divine Healing when he's the author of
[1:12:09] The
[1:12:10] Sickness you see why we had to have a
[1:12:16] prophet we had to have a prophet to
[1:12:18] break the
[1:12:19] symbols 30 something years he preached
[1:12:22] symbols
[1:12:29] Parables go look up the word
[1:12:32] Parable but let me give you a definition
[1:12:35] it's a long complicated
[1:12:37] story with times an underlying meaning
[1:12:40] that seems to be different from the
[1:12:42] surface
[1:12:45] meaning Jesus began to talk to them
[1:12:50] Pharisees and you know while they C on
[1:12:54] and they said we know he's talking about
[1:12:59] us he never went over you you do he just
[1:13:03] give a
[1:13:06] parable just make a parable out of it
[1:13:09] brother random preached in
[1:13:11] Parables that's why it's hard to
[1:13:14] understand
[1:13:14] it going to take the same holy spirit
[1:13:18] that he had to reveal it to you that's
[1:13:22] right right
[1:13:24] like I said how can that doctor say that
[1:13:26] snake is a sign of Divine Healing why
[1:13:30] did God tell a man just take a snake and
[1:13:33] put it up on a
[1:13:37] pole the thing that was killing
[1:13:41] them brother around said that was a sign
[1:13:45] that sin was
[1:13:47] judged so when they looked at it they
[1:13:50] wern't looking to the snake to heal them
[1:13:52] they were looking at the god that told
[1:13:53] him to put it there amen it healed the
[1:13:56] people yes when we get to playing around
[1:13:59] in this message whether it was brother
[1:14:01] random it broke the seals or or whether
[1:14:02] it was this one or the lamb or who is
[1:14:04] brother randam is he this that or the
[1:14:06] other and we get down to seeing the Lamb
[1:14:09] is almighty
[1:14:14] God Revelations chap 5 you remember we
[1:14:17] preached on that quite a while got an
[1:14:19] odd looking
[1:14:21] lamb that lamb in CH 5's got seven horns
[1:14:24] and seven eyes run around and said it
[1:14:27] come from the church
[1:14:32] ages I didn't say that I didn't have
[1:14:35] enough sense to you didn't
[1:14:41] me he said that lamb come from the
[1:14:43] church
[1:14:45] agent why because there 7even horn 7
[1:14:47] eyes represents the church head go back
[1:14:49] and read chapter one if you don't
[1:14:50] believe
[1:14:52] it
[1:14:55] just want to ask you a simple question
[1:14:57] in the day did God take your Revelation
[1:15:00] and go to
[1:15:07] Israel and we know Israel is going to be
[1:15:09] converted by the two witness I mean
[1:15:11] that's going to come under the two
[1:15:12] witness we know that we're not talking
[1:15:13] about we're just talking about plain
[1:15:17] language what kind of Revelation do you
[1:15:19] and I
[1:15:22] have said Israel had one God he said we
[1:15:25] got one
[1:15:26] God but what people don't read is what I
[1:15:29] reading there we have to pull it back on
[1:15:31] the
[1:15:32] screen I think you ought to remember
[1:15:41] it the world and aim the time is to
[1:15:47] un they'll know that God is still on the
[1:15:50] throne and he loves people that the hour
[1:15:54] hour that the world has longed to see is
[1:15:57] now
[1:15:58] approaching it cries out for
[1:16:00] Redemption look at the natural world out
[1:16:03] there what's taking
[1:16:04] place look what he says though tonight
[1:16:06] we speak upon it let the Holy Spirit
[1:16:09] Come forward now in his mighty power of
[1:16:12] Revelation that he might reveal to us
[1:16:14] these things which he wants us to know
[1:16:16] that he has in the last few
[1:16:22] nights
[1:16:29] people the people's heart and mind that
[1:16:32] they know God is still on the throne and
[1:16:34] he still loves his
[1:16:36] people brother rown said look at it said
[1:16:38] the church is
[1:16:40] back
[1:16:43] exactly like it was at
[1:16:46] Pentecost well I don't see it are you
[1:16:49] going to tell him it ain't
[1:16:51] right come on got to see it are you
[1:16:54] going to be bold enough to tell the
[1:16:56] prophet oh baby you got to see it I
[1:16:59] thought he had a
[1:17:02] vision a dream or a
[1:17:04] vision and in that dream or Vision that
[1:17:07] he saw a
[1:17:08] bride sure they got out of
[1:17:13] step
[1:17:16] right but he saw her lining up cuz he
[1:17:18] was holling at her
[1:17:22] right
[1:17:23] whether you believe it or whether you
[1:17:25] like it or whatever it is anybody out
[1:17:27] there or whatever you think about God is
[1:17:30] still God he didn't die when brother
[1:17:32] around
[1:17:33] dead he's still
[1:17:37] God you say well is he on the throne
[1:17:40] well he must be because if he ain't on
[1:17:43] the throne Redemption is over that's
[1:17:50] right I sure had to think that I was a
[1:17:53] parent that had
[1:17:55] children that was not
[1:17:57] saved and to think that I would be the
[1:18:00] one that decided they wouldn't be saved
[1:18:02] but fact of me saying Redemption was
[1:18:04] over cuz that's the first thing hit us
[1:18:06] in ' 63 I mean' 67 when left P not from
[1:18:11] the church I was in but from the people
[1:18:12] of the message that day was saying that
[1:18:14] Redemption was over in
[1:18:17] 63 and we've been 40 something years
[1:18:20] with Redemption being over so ain't
[1:18:21] nobody been saved since 6
[1:18:25] three where would you and I be that's
[1:18:28] right amen but you see we you take the
[1:18:31] ideas and the thoughts but who broke who
[1:18:34] opened those
[1:18:36] seals that's a simple
[1:18:39] point the way most people preach but R
[1:18:43] did but remember the seal was sealed up
[1:18:46] but R say on that breach and things
[1:18:48] through there I don't know what that
[1:18:49] first seal is when he gets on the first
[1:18:51] seal he said I don't know what the
[1:18:53] second seal is what he said or any of
[1:18:56] the other what he
[1:18:58] said you know what you say he did then
[1:19:01] you make him a
[1:19:03] liar your problem not
[1:19:07] me he didn't know that's right until the
[1:19:11] lamb broke the seal that's
[1:19:15] right to
[1:19:18] him but did he break the seal to him
[1:19:20] like breaking it and letting no he
[1:19:22] didn't break there is already broke
[1:19:24] that's what I'm trying to get you to see
[1:19:25] the seal was already broke it was broke
[1:19:28] 2,000 years
[1:19:31] ago handed down to a prophet in the last
[1:19:37] days to speak on it to you and I and
[1:19:40] tell us what those symbols
[1:19:43] were he said well then brother brother D
[1:19:47] you run out on Li because run around
[1:19:48] said there's no symbol on the seventh
[1:19:51] seal you're right I agree with
[1:19:57] you that's why if you read the seventh
[1:20:00] seal
[1:20:01] book and read it real
[1:20:05] careful you'll find brother brandham
[1:20:07] talking
[1:20:09] about his own life and what God was
[1:20:14] doing in him that's
[1:20:18] right Jesus preed six
[1:20:21] seals
[1:20:23] never preached the seventh that's
[1:20:25] Matthew 24 read
[1:20:27] it why cuz he was the
[1:20:31] seventh that's right amen I BL around
[1:20:34] wouldn't the
[1:20:35] seal but he knew what that seal
[1:20:40] was oh brother ROM page 45 I believe I'm
[1:20:45] right now if don't I'll get it for 45
[1:20:48] it's rising the Sun what is those
[1:20:51] seals he said it's it's a revelation of
[1:20:54] Jesus
[1:20:56] Christ
[1:20:58] right there you see it was a revelation
[1:21:00] of Jesus Christ that's the revelation of
[1:21:02] the Antichrist that's what everybody's
[1:21:04] always made you say well most people you
[1:21:06] say to them what is the first seal
[1:21:09] Antichrist that's not to see seal the
[1:21:11] Holy
[1:21:12] Spirit
[1:21:14] right Antichrist is in
[1:21:21] opposition
[1:21:23] what is that six seal brother Rand
[1:21:25] tribulation
[1:21:27] period That's Not Jesus
[1:21:34] Christ come on who broke your seal who
[1:21:36] do you
[1:21:39] find I believe they were broke 2,000
[1:21:41] years ago in glory because the Bible
[1:21:43] said your Prophet said that happen and
[1:21:45] then he come to a time that God told him
[1:21:49] what that symbol was under that seal and
[1:21:53] when he did he preached
[1:21:55] it there was what was to come to you and
[1:21:58] I that would open up the entire
[1:22:04] Bible you had never heard the one come
[1:22:06] on you you never heard the one where
[1:22:08] brother R was talking about let's see if
[1:22:10] I can
[1:22:11] paraphrase
[1:22:15] that we forget it let it go it
[1:22:19] won see the whole book is a revelation
[1:22:22] that Jesus Christ that's
[1:22:26] right that's why they couldn't
[1:22:28] understand it why we kept on reading
[1:22:30] Peter those people
[1:22:32] knew come on your Bible says they knew
[1:22:36] that it was not unto them that God done
[1:22:38] these
[1:22:41] things but it was toer us in the end
[1:22:46] time the whole Bible pointing to you and
[1:22:50] I like I was trying to say last
[1:22:54] night the Bible says that God spoke to
[1:22:58] Abraham told him to get up and
[1:23:01] go and a
[1:23:03] man that was totally from
[1:23:06] heathenism that's your prophet's words
[1:23:08] don't mind
[1:23:09] that he said Abraham was a
[1:23:12] heathen making Idols for his dad-in-law
[1:23:19] and he gets up and
[1:23:21] goes
[1:23:27] can't you see the day that God stopped
[1:23:31] you and told you to turn
[1:23:34] around and to repent of your sins you
[1:23:36] remember that I said their lives not
[1:23:39] rejoice here in the people tell of their
[1:23:44] experience of Jesus
[1:23:46] Christ in their
[1:23:50] life and when God first contacted
[1:23:54] them can you
[1:23:58] remember might have been in that little
[1:24:01] child
[1:24:02] stage might have been a little teenager
[1:24:04] might have been whatever but you
[1:24:06] remember that something began to talk to
[1:24:09] you
[1:24:10] right but yet we say if I had just been
[1:24:13] back there like Abraham and heard
[1:24:17] God who do you think's talking to
[1:24:19] you right you what I'm not Abraham
[1:24:22] brother around and said every son of
[1:24:26] Abraham was to take the same
[1:24:31] Journey that Abraham
[1:24:34] took look at Abraham he met God I mean
[1:24:38] God spoke to him they got his
[1:24:40] justification he begins to leave and
[1:24:42] follow that God and God begins to
[1:24:45] contact
[1:24:46] him after a while he literally comes
[1:24:49] right into his
[1:24:51] presence
[1:24:53] and he feeds him a
[1:24:56] c almighty
[1:24:58] God you say was that ever happened to me
[1:25:02] was you
[1:25:03] Justified have you been
[1:25:06] Sanctified have you been filled with the
[1:25:08] spirit of almighty God then God
[1:25:11] contacted you right amen when are we
[1:25:15] going to get to the place to take the
[1:25:16] scriptures where it when it talks of
[1:25:19] Jesus said I'm pleased to dwell in him
[1:25:21] why can't we believe that he's pleased
[1:25:23] to dwell in US amen amen
[1:25:26] right if he's not then we don't have the
[1:25:29] new
[1:25:31] birth that's simple
[1:25:35] enough there's a lot of difference in if
[1:25:37] you get Nam say the seal was broke 2,000
[1:25:40] years ago put in a symbol to keep the
[1:25:43] church waiting and the end time a
[1:25:45] prophet was to come that that symbol
[1:25:47] could be broke not the seal the seal was
[1:25:49] done
[1:25:51] broke
