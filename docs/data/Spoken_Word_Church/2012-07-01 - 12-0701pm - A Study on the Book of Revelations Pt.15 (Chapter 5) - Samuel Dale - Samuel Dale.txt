times coming up that the Lord that you'd be with us and all that we do and because that's what we want you to be guide us now and forgive our sins keep us in thine understanding hand that we may walk in you and open truly our eyes Lord that we may see you and then cast our Crown before thy feet believ in you Lord we God in Jesus name amen the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by a record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you may be seated the Lord had his blessings to the reading of the word and we got the fans turned and I turned them reverse where they wouldn't blow down right on C ones and I know it's hot but the air conditioner doing the best we could do brother Aaron went through it yesterday and things there N9 ton of units to blowing in this church right now there's 5 ton blowing up here but it just won't work when you got 100 bodies and and outside you got 100° weather it just won't do no more than what it can do all right now we went through the fourth chapter and this morning was kind of a review and just a few comments there at the end to tie on together to see what we've been talking about and uh remember we took basically the first chapter went through and then we jumped over to the fourth chapter and we uh begin to uh take verse by verse to explaining things and you know trying to move on and I said that would be a foundation to understand or a preparing now I want you to take these we go ahead and get them out way keep these bring them back with you you know fold them up you have to you going plan on doing it put it in front of the seat in front of you where you have one when you get back cuz I probably might not run anymore but see we've been preparing for the the point of trying to speak on uh chapter 5 and we'll get to that in a little while and you know try to move on into the the understanding going see the a preparation in other words you're preparing I'll be speaking more Wednesday on this but when you're preparing for something you're making ready you know it's everything and and all you're getting ready you uh you know somebody's coming to your home you clean your house you you go through you clean up everything you pick up everything you know and and then you you get everything ready and you're preparing a meal uh you know preparing a meal is not just uh going in and to a lot of people preparing a meal is paperwork to send you down to Cracker Barrel you know that's not much preparing but even at that point still in the Cracker Barrel somebody was doing the preparing and getting ready now you'll see more of this Wednesday night but I'm just saying this because of the way the prophet said it so what I've been doing with chapter 4 basically is preparing to be able to understand the fith chapter of Revelation all right we went through the open door the Rapture seeing the throne round about the rainbow round about The Throne 24 Elders combat Beast um and see all of that it shows us the reality of the word of God in The Bride of all ages and in a final climax of The Bride in the end time in the Rapture of the church all right because you know trying to take what's here comparing it to what we see there Etc and been doing it verse by verse and I hope you followed what I was saying on that line all right but now to not lay much of a background cuz we've done that this morning basically doing it getting ready but see now we're to enter the uh fifth chapter of the Book of Revelations and uh if you want to let's read that fifth chapter the first verse and they don't have to pull it up because it's fine but they jump to our 4 I do they generally do they can bring it up at Revelations 51 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals All right now as you're looking there in your Bibles look over to uh Revelations 4:2 and notice I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one set on the throne all right but in chapter 4 it doesn't mention a book right right right doesn't say anything about a book in the hand right all right chapter 5 you immediately see it's the same Throne the same situation one sitting on the throne that we went through in the fourth chapter which is the the father's Throne Spirit or the baptism of the Holy Ghost the one that Jesus come to prepare and make a way for the The Throne all right and that Throne is in the heart of man here upon Earth by the new birth true all right right but now you find that here in chapter 5 that there is a book in the hand of the one sitting on the the throne now we will not get into that this afternoon because I'm just I I want to go real slow and just uh be able to understand you know as we go along all right now Revelations 5 one and I saw in the right hand of him that sit on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals now we're not going to get down into that part we're only going to get to the point that I want you to see of one sitting on the throne and a book in his hand all right now remember how we done in chapter 4 door opened you didn't see Throne door opened right all right then we took another sermon then we saw a throne right yes all right we didn't talk about in the second message the one sitting on the throne right we move that over to like the third message Etc that's why it took so long because it's all a opening of a scene that God is doing something and watch it in a minute when we we cover that about a scene in glory and just watch the the uh the doings you know because that's what we want to try to get to but you understand what I'm trying to say see Revelation 4 we saw the the door open then we saw a throne MH all right we covered what that was and what it meant then we covered one sitting on the throne and who that was and what was going on and how was the Father Strong see then we saw the 24 Elders then we saw the rainbow and then we saw you know and and to me it's like a it's like a a movie as you go in across you know and you see a scene now remember that in a minute a scene the scene is not the whole movie right it's brought forth in a the word scene means it's got an odd meaning to it the word seen actually means a stage not a stage like this you know not a stage a platform no it means the word stage in other words something is d on the platform something is there for you to see right all right the actors are there so if you were watching a movie or a play being acted out you would have a curtain in front it opens and a scene starts right you know y okay a little boy and a little girl you know a scene starts this one is over here playing in the yard this one's over here at the other house playing in the yard whatever you know all right then that's as far as you can go right cuz it's not a rolling thing you know like a movie picture so what you do is you close the curtains right right and that was a little boy and a little girl at 5 years old you know or something and you close a curtain all the next scene is a little boy and girl at 12 years old or something you know m all right you you get the picture right that's what you call a scene or a stage all right now keep that in mind and keep these quotes that I give you see then it just keeps unfolding right the and then the next third scene would be a young boy and a young girl going off to college and they're both in college y all right scene four close a curtain hold back up scene four Girl Meets Boy Boy Meets Girl you know they fall in love this all right see that's more like the acts of a play right and that's what's happening to me that helps me to understand the Book of Revelations but I don't just read it a door open in heaven and there's a throne and one sitting on the throne and well I want to know what all this mean or you know what's the of this what's the importance of knowing what this is you know well to me it's a very positive very important thing right right now this is something that's been with me for a long time so go ahead and pull number one on quotes brothers and look what brother Brown said about revelation 5 look what he's talking about this is taken from the breach 1963 317e paragraph 238 notice he's not an animal and this is in Revelations 5 all of these quotes today will be maybe seconds but somewhere out talking about but it'll go back to Revelations 5 okay so tie everything back to Revelations 5 okay notice he's not an animal he took the book out of the right hand of him that s on the throne that's who was it the owner the original owner that had the B book of redemption in his right hand and no angel no Angelic being nothing else could take the place brother Bron said Elijah was there Moses was there all the prophets were there all the sages were there nobody was worthy to take the book we'll get to that as we go on over a little further all right and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand what was it brother this is the most Sublime thing in the scripture yep an act a act that not an angel not nothing could do it and the lamb come and took it from the right hand of him that set upon the throne what is it now it belongs to the lamb amen all right now without getting into the lamb that much but I want you to think about these things most Sublime that's right I wrote down the word sublime means elevated or lofty in thought Su blimy you know you say that was Sublime in other words you're meaning that it's highly elevated or it's lofty in thought or or language um and what it's doing it's impressing the mind with a sense of grandure or grandure you say that grur n d EU or E are something amen aspiring inspiring all yeah now I didn't say this so your Prophet didn't say uh Luke 17:30 Revelation 107 Malachi 4 was the most sublim scriptures in the Bible right I quote those because those are the quotes that we give most of the time but he said Revelations 5 Y is the most Sublime inspiring all remember when we we get over about the seventh seal about 20 years from now probably that they stand in all right that's the words your Prophet says right they stand in all but it's like see to me the Book of Revelations is like a in the other writings is more or less describing uh showing him in different things but the Book of Revelations is like a SC of a play right it's just opening all right and see it I I don't understand how we can understand it any other way than that then to follow it is that all right now look what he goes on to say here cuz this will be a continual reading for a minute that was paragraph 238 paragraph 239 yeah there you go God's law required he's the one that holds it God's law required a kinsman redeemer and the lamb come forth come out boldly I am their Kinsman I am their redeemer I now have made intercession for them and now I've come to claim their rights for them all right amen amen I've come to claim their rights and that they have a right to everything that lost in the fall and I pay the price oh brother weed Don't It Make You Feel religious not my good works which we have done but by his not by Good Works which we have done but by his Mercy oh wait a minute and them elders and everything else begin to throw off their crowns and dignities begin to get on the ground dignitaries no one no one could do it and he walked right up to the right hand of God and took the book out out of his hand and claimed his right I have died for them I am their kinsman redeemer I have I am the mediator my blood was shed I have become man and I did this in order to get to church back again the one I saw fora before the foundation of the world I have purposed it I spoke that it would be there and nobody was able to take it but I went down and done it myself I am their Kinsmen I became kin Folk and he takes the book amen watch who's waiting that who's who's there for me tonight who is that one church that's waiting there what else could wait there for you with that kinsman redeemer oh my what a Sublime statement or act now he has a title need of redemption I believe true Redemption he has it in his hand mediation is done he has it in his hand remember it's been in the hand of God all the time but now it's in the hand of the lamb now watch the title de of redemption of all creation is in his hand and he's coming to claim it back for the human race not claim it back to Angels claim it back to the human race which it was given for to make Sons and Daughters of God again bring them back to a Garden of Eden everything they lost the whole creation the trees the animals everything else know that make you feel real good he said I thought I was tired and I'm not tired now right let me make sure where I get to right I thought I was tired but I'm not now see sometimes I think I get I'm getting too old to preach and I go and see something like that and think I think I'm a Young Man m it does something to you see where I know this that there's someone there waiting for me there's someone paid the price that I couldn't pay that's right he did it for me Charlie he did it for you he did it for the whole human race and now he comes forth to claim his Redemptive rights claim it for who not for himself for us he's one of us he's our kin folks oh my he's my brother he's my savior he's my God he's my kinsman redeemer he's all for what was I without him or what could I be without him do you see he's my all and he's standing there as our Kinsman and now he's been interceding for me up there up till this time and now he comes forth and takes a book of redemption to claim his rights to what he did for us amen now what most people do does when they read see that's what people when BR around and preached this in ' 63 they said see there the lamb left a mercy seat no more Redemption act 63 that's what a lot of Doctrine was they asked brother brandom and he said where did you get that I never said nothing like that yeah you know they asked should we should we preach should we give all call he said I never said nothing like that that's right would you see it's like the Lord Jesus when he said what is it if John remains till I come a saying went out from the very disciples among the 12 see they said John would wasn't going to die how be it the Bible said he didn't say that he had no reference that John was going to live to be 2,000 years old right right but you see it's what we think so when you talk of seals and things and and Redemption we think of it all being over I think of it as just beginning that's right right amen yes sir we've got to be able to see Revelations 5 before we can understand Revelation 6 now Revelation 6 starts opening in the seals right but we got to understand Revelations 5 we don't understand that it won't work right just like it was it brother R said on Daniel 70 weeks he said if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks that's right you'll miss it in the seals but everybody knows all about the seals and nothing about Daniel 70 weeks yeah they won't touch it the man said the other day we heard him he said that all them numbers there no way to get them together what he already said there's no way I can get them together that's the only problem I said Billy Graham said nobody can understand the Trinity he would have said I can't and I don't he her but I'd sure like to sit down with the brother on the Daniel 70 weeks right yes sir but it never will happen so who's concerned I'm not tearing down his bubble I'm trying to get me and you out of the bubble get us into reality amen to see what's taking place I gave you statements along in the message on the fourth chapter of Revelations and I said if I was you I'd write this down you remember them how many of you wrote them down let me give you one now write it down unless we can see how this one gets on the throne right that's right and of the book he has in his hand and where the lamb comes to take the book we won't understand what's going on that's right right yep we will not understand it do we know what this is then that we're looking at brother said it was the most Sublime the greatest thing you could think of the greatest scripture one time I I don't remember exactly but if I get it wrong forgive me he said this makes you feel like going over crawling under 10 crawling under concrete block with a 10 gallon hat on something like that BL in other words how little it makes you of how simple God does anything right and yet we're stumbling all over it trying to find it it's always illustrate one rock laying out in a football field 300 yd long what is it 100 yard wide or is it 50 or 60 yard wide 50 yard wide 100 yard long and you're looking for a rock and there's not but one and you stumble over it trying to find the thing that's something man that's the way we do with our stupidity of intelligence of our mind right is we try to figure it out without without simply believing what God says that's right think about it don't think about redemption's over right now there will be a day when will be over right and he'll claim his possession right right there'll be a Rapture right right it's not happened yet all right you can spiritualize all you want to and I do to and believe in it but you know you can spiritualize it all day long but if it don't something happen to this body my spiritual might be something wrong with it so let's look at the next quote and I gave this quote to you so if you will keep it go ahead brother on quote number two I gave you this one where you could know everything on number two yeah yes this is on number two see that was on the breach all right now watch what he says here on paragraph 79 and 80 the revelations chap 5 Jeffersonville you know 61618 now we find out then that this first beginning of the chapter that we find the chapter is just a tick now I looked up everything I could find on TI block it was a hard one to deal with I'm probably not familiar with a word maybe some of you know T block but I can tell you the definition in a second but it's a diamond hitch we're more related to a diamond hitch uh really a relation of a to is a is a rope going around a piece of wood in the middle yeah and it's a capability of moving things but really a diamond hitch that ties the last part of the church age of the third chapter now a diamond hitch it's in other words it's not a diamond it it would just be a hitch made that it be so strong you can't break it and things M it's you're just talking about something that can tie two things together see the ti Block in the diamond hitch means that there's an ability to be able to put two things together that cannot be pulled apart we look at it on a a car or a truck and we we see that there's you know what you call a military hits gives you more of an idea on your car you got a circular thing and on the other side of it that's got got a clip over and it is supposed to be the best hitch of all better than the ball and the thing but it just simply means to be able to tie two things together right all right now watch what he says is tied together and you'll see why I went through chapter 4 before going into this so the fifth chapter is just a TI block it it's a diamond hitch that ties the last part of the church age of the third chapter watch the fourth chapter tells what John was taken up in the heaven and the prepare the fifth chapter is preparing for these huh chapter 3 the fourth chapter of the Book of Revelation is a TI block a diamond hitch to be able to understand the fifth chapter okay something Ty the two together now watch it the fourth chapter tells what John was taken up into heaven and the FI is preparing for these were you went through the seven Church ages and John's lifted up in the four chapter the raptures the T block the the thing John went through be able to tie together to be able to go to heaven and see it all right and the fifth chapter he's just set the scene for the opening the Seven Seals just as he did in the first chapter opening the way for the seven Church ages you could have never had the seven Church ages yet had chapter one that's right you would had two and three see would to come right and now chapter one the layth place to where they could hitch together right tie it all into a channel and be in the right place all right so what does he say setting a scene for the opening of The Seven seal just as he did in the first chapter of Revelation Opening way for the seven Church edges there he stands in the seven golden candlesticks and he's to look upon his Jasper and Sh Stone and he's preparing for these seven Church ages now where was he doing that back in chapter one the one standing in the midst of seven gold C like son of man is preparing to be able to understand the church AG amen now he's preparing to be able to understand the seals now he's preparing for the opening of those Seven Seals of redemption see that's what the fifth chapter is chapter one ties together from the church and the book of Acts Etc and all and brings in the church ages chapter 4 is a Rapture bringing you from the church ages in the glory to where you can understand chapter 5 okay now one of these days I'll just come back and show you what I'm talking about in simple language like I did this morning just preach a message on it all right but bear with me till you get there because if I just preach a simple message on it then you won't go home and study it and I want you to study it out watch what he said fth chapter that's read I kind of read it and just take it from there and talk on it and give the other parts of the scripture is because it's it isn't verse by verse something that's happening chapter 5 is not verse by verse something happening it's preparing for something to happen and if you get the preparation you remember all the mo food together for the meal all the things you know you have a wedding takes weeks of preparing getting everything said you know right lot of preparation right then you just you read you ready for it then and That's the Way It Is by faith or something El that's this the seals all right it's not a verse by verse right you had to cover verse by verse you have to because what would be a movie without scenes that's right boy and girl playing in the yard one in one yard one in the other one blue boy and girl getting married riding off into the sunset that'd be beautiful when when you I've read the book yeah what' you read I read the introduction and I read the last page I know all about the book who's John and Mary I don't know I told you I used to do that when I was in school I hated to read to some degrees what they wanted me to read I want to read something else but I would read the introduction and I'd read the last few pages and I'd write them a what was that called a book report book report I'm just glad the teacher never read the book cuz I know what I had in it wouldn't what was in the book I just wrote in there what I thought and then it's elas John and Mary goes riding off you know but listen church it's not a verse by verse I gave a next quote look at the next one which is a Revelation chapter 5 um this is paragraph 58 and I just give you that where you get what he's to saying in chapter 4 he went through taking it verse by verse okay chapter 5 is not verse by verse it's a scene now listen to what I'm saying are you ready yes to see the difference in a scene than a verse by verse they take a verse by verse and they make a movie oh now if I miss this I don't I never saw the whole movie what was his name crocodile dunde or whatever the old guy you know in the movie he was supposed to hit somebody instead of it he just whooped out a gun shot him they just put it in the movie it wasn't even scheduled I remember that years ago or something see because in making a movie the director he follows the script to a degree but he makes out his own plan right it wouldn't be too good of a movie to go watch the life of Samuel Dale I wouldn't even watch it see about halfway through you get some board no but man they got all this going what was that old song they wrote and the guy wrote a song they had about four verses you remember I remember that way back but anyhow he sent it in for them to take and the guy wrote back said there's no lust in it there's no murder in it there's no this or that or the other you remember the old country music song he went back and wrote about his mama got run over train and all kind of things put it in the song and made a head out of it you see I wouldn't want nobody to put my life down cuz it wouldn't be nice enough for them they want to pop it off you don't give it all the Lord okay you wait that's what I was doing now listen a scene then the fifth chapter is not a verse by verse the fourth chapter is verse by verse you said well why you why would brother R say that he said it's not a verse by verse it's a scene CU to see fourth chapter takes you from Earth to glory and you got to go through the verses yeah all right chapter this starts off one sitting on the throne with a book in his hand there's no verse by verse where did that happen what took place fourth chapter tells you this this this this is up to there it was a verse by verse now it's a scene now they got to write the book to get a scene from it right that's right but you know how they do especially in movies today who was the uh Alfred Hitchcock Alfred Hitchcock back in our day you know how old you used to have that thing you know where that you come down and you tell the story it never did ended worth any sense at all right I remember one of them this boy he had a choice that he could take the right door or the left door he took the right door he got his wife he took the left door he got a line right I remember that but it ended before he got to the door you know you know see movies today they don't give you full description because they found out and one of these days you'll find out why I joke a little bit okay you find that out I just told you a minute ago I I've done that to get you away but listen in the movies today what is it there's only so many so many minutes of the human mind if you go over so many minutes on one line the mind will start deteriorating away w't keep up so you watch this stuff now it's fast never over 5 minutes in a scene or 10 they're here they're here they're here they're there you know these old Soap Box operas you see what I'm talking about one scene two minutes see two people talk Scene Three these people s talking and you don't know what in the world's going on but see it's clicking your mind to keep you listening all right so as we open in the fifth chapter the scene is a throne and one sitting on the throne and the book in his hand a s told you chapter 4 it was a door open you didn't see the throne then second scene was thrown third scene was one on the throne fourth scene was 24 Elders you hit the fifth it's going to be fast because it's up there for you to see it so what do you see you bypass all of the background and you see the throne one sitting on the throne and a book in his hand now we'll get down later to where it'll show the um what these taking place but my whole purpose is one thing that I gave you there for you to take and read this is not a verse by verse this is is a scene setting a stage for the opening of the seals amen no way the seals can break until you see that Throne that one sitting on that throne and see that book is in his hand there's number two thoughts that I'd write down you'll never know what the Book of Revelations is until you see Revelations 5 the throne the one on the throne the book in his hand right you will never know know what's going on in the opening of the seals that's why everybody says the seals is the is the Holy Ghost don't even know what they're preaching you know it's Revelation then they'll say that it's for the Antichrist the one group goes one way it's a revelation it's what this great the other goes they can't come in the Middle with the tiit and tie it together with the rest of the Bible right that's why they come up with this polygamy under the the doings all right now let me throw a TI hitch in let me throw a d block in this message could not have been understood until this age that's right right go ahead with number four same ones we had this morning how can it ever take place until the Eagles come right right that's right could not be done pull the next one until the age of the Eagles appear can't be revealed Meli 4 had to come into being Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 and then the Eagles has got to come right the Eagles is the only ones that can understand understand what happened in Revelations 5 they can't understand what's going on look what your Prophet says now go to number six he's giving you some quotes to get a stage set in your mind and look what he says in the breach message 1963 317 uh paragraph 29 291 now watch when he done that watch what taken place you talk about a jubilee now he in Revelations 5 you want to read back up above there get it not then you come down here and get it below it you'll see where he's at he's in Revelations 5 he may be over in talking in the breach but he's talking about Revelations 5 to watch now this is actually exactly the breaking of them seals take place in the fifth chapter now let me state it like this brother random said if you miss the opening of the seals what did he say to do go to Christ mystery of God reveal that's quote now if you want it amen he didn't say go back to the seal book again he didn't say go through through the Daniel 70 weeks or church ages or whatever he said go to Christ and M your God revealed why in there is the complete revelation of Redemption all right now don't go back to there so if you don't understand the opening to the seals uh you might want to come back to the breach and read it and reread it and reread it and start with that thought in mind Revelations 5 is exactly the opening of the seals now I know where your mind's going see my mind is in Revelations 5 the ti hitch the diamond you know holding you're looking at it like Seal white horse rider red horse rider you might want to come down out of the ceiling just a little bit and walk I'm an eagle I'm soaring the skies yeah he soord right on out the picture remember there's 40 something Eagles and there's even vulture Eagles so Crow all you want to he said will you sure in B CU this morning you trying to encourage us to be Eagles that's right true Eagles CU a true Eagle will understand that's right so now this is exactly the break them SE watch it what he says we'll get in that high hour of Silence where's High hour of Silence Revelation 8:1 the opening of the seventh seal right just after this watch this and we started in and we finished this up next Sunday night right here right here Revelations 81 has got to finish in Revelations 5 or your Prophet missed it now read what he saying it started in we finish this up next Sunday night right here and listen close now are you ready say Amen listen close what took place and when he had did this when all creation was groaning no one know what to do and John was weeping here come the lamb walked over and this book was in the hands of the original owner because man had felled and lost it and no man was able to take it anymore to redeem the Earth no priest Pope Nothing as I said but the lamb came up no Mary no saint this or no saint this or saint that the lamb will come up bloody slain and took the book out of the right hand all right watch it of him that sat upon the throne and when they seen there was a redeemer and all the souls under the altar when the Angels when the elders never seen everything seen it when this was done all right look at the next now you back in the breach preaches 63 paragraph 299 talk about a jubilee talk about a time when that lamb walked out see the books even sealed in heaven yeah right the book is sealed in heaven nobody on Earth could understand it and nobody in heaven could understand it was only one had understood it that's the one sitting there with it in his hand yep right now he understood it right but you don't what him say it see the Mysteries are say is my name there I don't know but I hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world Amen but the first thing that represented that Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world he took the book Glory opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to earth to his seventh angel now remember this get the stage takes the book opens it ends it down we're going to get a stage in between just a second you remember that tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people there you are oh my what happened the screams the shouts the Hallelujah the anointed the power the glory the manifestation and old John who had been standing there our brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in Earth and everything in the sea heard me hollering that's Revelations 5 amen blessings and honor and might and power be to him that lives forever talk about a happy time when them seals broke broke back there with John it wasn't but one seal to break that was the seven six seals wrote in the Bible is broke talk about a happy time when the seals broke John must have looked at him and seen a p the curtain of time and said Dar John oh he was so happy you remember what I said he he went on over to chapter 22 and he said the name written in the foundation stone his name is in there because the apostles were there I joh oh he was so happy he said everything in heaven he must have really cried out didn't he everything in heaven everything in Earth everything beneath the Earth every creature and everything else heard me saying now that doesn't mean he heard them saying they heard him saying all right amen blessings and glory and wisdom and power and might and riches belong unto him young amen but there's something happened I heard that we've got to see in chapter five we just take the lamb he take some book and breaks it now listen to what's your Prophet had to say about it look at number eight and look to date 64 12:27 who do you say this is in other words actually seal BR paragraph 33:34 get down to the part we're looking at bless the word Lord as I read it there's no man that that's able or sufficient to interpret that word John saw the book in the hand of him that sat upon the throne there was no one in heaven or on Earth Earth or beneath the Earth that was worthy to even look at the book but one of the elders said behold the line of the tribe of Judah had prevailed John looking to see a line he saw a lamb that had been slain a bloody lamb come forth and took the book climbed upon the throne and said down little something added there other than just grabbing a book and ripping it off and climbed upon the throne now all the celebrity of heaven took their crowns from their heads and bowed and know he was worthy Lord we pray that he'll come to the throne of our hearts are you reading climbed upon on the throne and said I am now you might think I miss a lot but I told you without the B is of the Holy Ghost is ain't going to work we got to have the Throne of God in our heart why Lord we pray that you'll come to the throne of our hearts this morning that's right climb up and take possession of every thought that we have and take the word and speak it to us that we might know more about him and his plan in our lives we ask this in Jesus name amen CL upon the throne of our heart you see all it says in Revelation 5 that there was one sitting on the throne and a book in his hand brother R said one come forth and took the book climbed upon the throne and sat down now you might have thought I was just trying to say something in that chapter 4 but I did preach a message about as he come from history to climb upon your throne in your heart in your life and Sh down right is he on the throne in your heart right if not you will never understand the seals that's right right see it's got to happen here before it can happen to her that's right amen climb up on the throne and Sh I as he climbed upon your that's right is he the king of your life I pray he'll come to the throne of our hearts this morning climb up and take possession of her thought that we have and take the word and speak it to us that we might know more about him his plans in our life one more look at number nine well I've got two more but it's all in numbered souls in prison those that are in prison now 63 11 10 and John looked to see a lamb or a lion and what did he find a lamb it was a bloody lamb a lamb that had been slain how long since the foundation of the world the lamb came forth walked up up to him that had the book in his right hand and received the book climbed upon on the throne and set down that's it it's all over when when the seals were revealed when's it over when the seals was revealed when the last one that was everything that he had redeemed there was nothing look the next paragraph 151 and then when the last name on that book was redeemed the lamb came forth and took the book I'm the one that did it you know that some people believe that that was brother Brown a man person personally told me that okay sure he said have you ever read that I P it's page 26 souls in prison about the lamb climbing up on the Drone sitting down the brother Brown on speaks in the first person and says I am the one that did it brother Rand wasn't the one that cled up on the throne and S down that's right you're deity that's right he wasn't the one that climbed upon the throne that has to be the Lord Jesus Christ amen but brother Ram can't climb up the throne in your heart that's right that's right but the Lord Jesus Christ can right the rest of that is fine because you're talking about the Redeemer the book that he took in his hand and he comes back down right again uh run it down to paragraph 156 we'll quit on this one this is out of the the message of the trolls in prison notice it was the seventh Angel's message that was to reveal the seventh Seven Seals Revelation 10:7 now you'll find it see and he saw this Ang come down with his foot on land and on sea where's that Revelations 101 right that was Christ had a rainbow over his head notice him you'll find him in Revelations 1 again with the rainbow over his head to look upon his Jasper and Sardis and so forth here he comes put one hand one foot on land one upon on the water raised up and a rainbow over his head a COV but he said you'll find him in Revelations 1 Revelations 1 and Revelations 10 then is identical yep as he climbed upon your throne sit down in your life is he the author and finisher of our Salvation is he the root and Offspring bright and Morning Star the Alpha and Omega you see the all of it amen he said brother Dale what have you been preaching today you lost me okay where I L you chapter 5 is a scene in heaven in that scene in heaven you find one one sitting on the throne the book in his hand right then you find a lamb that comes forth and takes a book where does that lamb come from and sits down on the throne becomes the one on the throne right then he can break the seals just taking the book is not the the whole story The Lamb took the book but he's got to break the seals right but there's one thing for sure if nobody was worthy even to look on the book and brother R said Moses was there Elijah was there the sage the prophets were there and said nobody was Worthy if he was worthy to take the book He's Worthy to open the seals where did he come from how did he get there he's a lamb he's not an animal we read a quote in there right he's not an animal said because he took the book right the lamb couldn't take the book but he could do it with his mouth but you know what it' be yes and how could he climb up on the throne and Sh down that's right I'll end with one statement if he's not on the throne of our hearts we're still trinitarian as well as we've ever been if he's not the one prevalent person sitting on the throne in your heart are your Revelation your Doctrine your idea your throne your concept then there's no need to worry about the opening of the seal right that's right we better find where that lamb come from think on these things A Simple Plan of Redemption a seen that when the stage would open there it is there's other things you'll find in there that we'll cover going down through there what takes place but the main scene is what Throne one sitting on the throne a book in his hand and a lamb comes up and takes the book and climbs up on the throne and S down and says I'm the one that done it amen if you can't see one true and living God Amen you can't follow under the acts of the pl right if you can't see Jesus Christ as brother around said when you're what not let's see he said when you begin to see the word you see in Jesus right right right he said if you don't see Christ in every verse y go back and read it again he said you missed something and I read the Bible the first time and I know you have to and it says and so and so be got so and so and so and so beg got so and so and 14 chapters later so and so still begotten so and so amen and I wondered well what is all of this doing in the Bible then right in the middle it would just have a little catch right in the middle but it's a lineage coming down to David and from David to Jesus Christ but you see that's where people can't even follow lineages you cannot follow the lineage of Jesus Christ from David to Jesus your lineage guns from Joseph to Joseph right didn't come to Jesus read your Bible cuz he come to Mary see and Mary has no lineage connection the Bible said Joseph right right well now we know Joseph wasn't his father we know Mary was just an incubator because he didn't even call her mother MH right she was just an incubator something used brother random says uh Masterpiece that Mary wasn't even the word he said she was a carrier of the word amen that's right he said but he is the word amen and see we can't just talk about giving birth to Jesus Christ that's wonderful we got to be the word that Jesus Christ is that's right that's right there's number three I'd write down that's right and think on these things let stand get get ready for communion today I'll get enough voice to preach instead of just talk just still then we just talk won worry about it cuz if I preach too hard I I preach my heart out down in brother college is and it's just wonderful thought that one of the old days when I used to preach you know but there sometimes I don't have the voice so I just have to waake it down and don't worry about it right don't be concerned about but think about it now the communion as we come to the par to take the communion just think on these things think about Jesus Christ what's transpiring what he's doing now what he's trying to reveal himself to you and I but he's revealing himself in you and I at the same time he reveals himself to us making us then part of the mystery if brother Rand was right I believe it's cist of mystery God revealed I than you page 74 he said the bride is part of the mystery and must be revealed yes well if you stop in revealing Jesus only you know what you are a Oneness but if you can see come over into a bride you can see who we really are we're the last in morphe of God upon this Earth it may not look like it but you know if you'd have been back there and have seen him walking you wouldn't have seen a lot would you if you didn't get to see the Miracles that took place or something in his life then what would you have thought about his life what he was doing than these things F preparing the fifth chapter is preparing for the opening if you're preparing you got to have everything in place right now said made this statement many years ago and I keep making it there's a Doctrine among the people of the message that said brother Brandon was wrong in his early part of his ministry couldn't be trusted before the seals broke and then you just come after the seals break and ours is you know you got to stay after the seals to understand anything if that be so then brother brandham could not have had the foundation of preparation for the opening of The Seven Seals that's right if he wasn't right then look what you're saying amen there's no foundation for him to stand on that's right we know you say well what about all this that the only one you can say anything about is the white horse rider and just remember even though he was a prophet God had it seal to him until the seal came off that's right so he could say the white horse riders the Holy Ghost and you go check the message when he'd say it he'd said If I'm right the Holy Ghost will come and vindicate me being right and teaching the White Horse riter as a Holy Ghost and see if the Holy Ghost didn't come down vindicate check it yeah but that's vindicating that no no light had ever shined on that he wasn't responsible because light had never shined on it after it shined he saw who it was right do you see who it is do you see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever or are you just like a lot of people well you know brother br will be back one of these days and he'll pick us all up I hope that's right I told you this morning I don't want to bust nobody's boat but I just don't believe it that way I believe that we got to be right right Play Amen and people asked me something one time about those things and this is what I said to him I said if brother brandham come right out here and put a tent up in front of this church I said you would not understand what he's saying I said the reason is you don't know what he's already said that's right and I'm in at then and I still stand by right out here in front of this church Lula Georgia put up a tent preach in it if we didn't know what he had already said and had a foundation laid by the word of God and had anchored in our hearts we wouldn't know what in the world he's talking about that's where people don't understand me but I don't mind saying Lula Georgia because I know if it's not revealed you and I don't have it that's right talking about it is one thing but a revelation is another that's right think on these things 1 Corinthians 11:23 foray I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he spray it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do year as often as you drink it in remembrance of me where as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do you the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come the reason Paul made that last statement they had gotten down to where that they were just getting together and eating you know and then they maybe have something related to communion or whatever and he said don't just get get e a meal yeah make it a serious thing that's why we put it right at the end of a service take communion after the word is gone are we're supposed to have our clothes on ready to go to the promised land right right and then we can take the communion so thank on these things let's just have a moment of Silent prayer praying one for another that we may all be be together in him just have your way with each one of our hearts and lives we ask it all in Jesus name name amen the Bible said he took bread and blessed it and then break it so just think about these things think about the word of how great it was to be able to walk with them that was back there when they spoke the word wouldn't it been something to be able to stand there and seen Moses just reach that Rod out and just the sea just pared you know wouldn't it been something to stand there when a man is Dead 4 days and Lazarus come for that'd be great wouldn't it but what about all of them are waiting on you and I to become the word for this age in this time amen think on these things because if it's Hebrews 13:8 then he's the same today as he ever was this will have a whole lot more meaning to it when we get over there but now it's just an act or a thing that we do but the sick's been healed by the word like this right do just think on these things we ask you to sanctify the bread and the partakers Lord that we may be one together in you Jesus name father we thank you for this wine has gone through the part of preserving it meaning it's speaking of you Lord we ask you now that you would just bless and as we eat a little piece of bread we drank this little sip of wine that tomorrow there'll be blood cells in our body created from that very fact how much more is it in the spiritual of what we're doing Lord cuz this this is not the blood of our Lord and savior but it's an example of it just have your Holy Spirit Come and Quicken these things unto us we love you and we thank you sanctify the wine and the partakers in Jesus name amen amen be a wonderful hour to be able to sit around the throne him come and wipe the tears from eyes say Well done be a great day but this is a wonderful time to be able to just see what little bit of the word that we see and I say a little bit because we may think we know a whole lot but comparing it to what God really is we only know a little bit we're just beginning to get the scales as we preached about the other night about the eagle to get them scales off of our eyes that we can see no good for us to soar into the heavens if we can't see right so let's get everything in the right order just just depend upon him and thanks but yeah but brother Dale you've preached on the seals you preached on all this yes if I come around I got 50 more years man Brother Richard was talking this morning about brother uh lale I think he said he was about 97 when he passed away I think he would be 98 and sometime this year and you know what a lot of us could live that long if time last that's right I don't want to I'm honest I don't want 20 more years I want to get out of here but it could happen right there's people now 114 years old H you said not sure would be a mess to be that old well only thing I've ever asked God to do for me I've asked him in sincerity of one thing cuz I never realized I'd ever get this old I didn't you know I didn't believe I would but the only thing I asked him I said Lord let me keep my mind I mean if I can't move a muscle and I can't do anything let me keep my mind you know the word that I can talk about him and remember him and how great he is wonderful day let's all partake together am man you can be SE we get ready to go in foot Wasing second from John 13th chapter verse 2 supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas this carried Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands as he would come from God and went to God he rised from suffer and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into to a basin begin to wash the disciples feet and to WIP them with a cowel where with he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord do thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter Sith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me Simon Peter Sith unto him Lord my not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said unto him he that is wash needest not Sav to wash his feet but he is clean every with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was sat down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet seat for I've have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you early verly I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's stand together just remember pray for the service Wednesday pray the Lord would bless and be with all of these requests that we've given on let's just pray before the sisters go downstairs father we thank you you for this day and we pray now that you'd bless and guide each and every one of us and as we finish up Lord with this foot washing part of the service today we pray that you would just break into our hearts the understanding and let us see all about you we love you and we thank you be with the people that on the highway home give everybody a safe journey and Lord
