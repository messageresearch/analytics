pronounce them sister monica's brother so we looking forward to hearing him never heard him minister and then brother tom ernest will be taking the evening service so remember these you know you know i haven't received any comment about the fourth of july weekend so you know we'll do whatever and uh you know because i told you we could have the saturday and we're going to have saturday night bible study and sunday services so we can have saturday night bible study we can have the fish fry that afternoon and you know that way we'll have hot dogs and things for those that don't like fish and but i don't understand why anybody would like fish i mean that's like banana pudding why in the world wouldn't anybody like banana pudding and them dead ripens too you know i don't understand that but anyhow um you know so i guess it'd be left up to me to make the choice then if no comments and then everybody can blame me decide it wants it this way and blame it as i don't want to blame it so just blame me we'll have the fish fry on saturday afternoon we'll start at about somewhere around two o'clock cooking we'll eat somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 30 5 breaking 4 30 and or 4 something whatever you come and then we'll have bibles we'll have the kids they can play and games and do things you know outside in the playgrounds and we'll have bible study saturday night then we'll have the sunday services regular all right and we are working on trying to get somebody to come in and minister for us so we don't know yet what will be but you just pray that the lord would bless each one of us and we'll do it that way and you that are from out of town that do not have a you know like if you have to come up saturday and go back if you'll let us know we will um you know supply you a place a house to stay in or something to do to where that you can spend saturday night with us some of us that you don't have to drive back you know and put a burden on you that is the reason that we do not do like a lot of other churches and have a lot of saturday night services because people having to drive so far and come back but you know um we started here july the 4th 1971 and it'll be what 39 or 40 years 41 years how many years is it i can't count that five sir uh uh you go 40 what 43 mr charlotte's over there counting i ain't i have to take my shoes off so yes to go above 10 so i can but we will be having that for that weekend and uh charlotte and richard can well remember that weekend because i think they were dating then you weren't married would you and they were sitting right out here on the side of the highway and uh that first service and they just for some reason decided to move and they went and drove around to somewhere else i don't really know where they parked but about the time that they finished the guy came down the road you all of you know and hit all five vehicles it was sitting outside out there if they had been sitting there it would have been very dangerous so the lord works things out and gets everything ready and makes it all work right so we appreciate the lord doing that all right so that's the way we will be doing if we can you know get a hold of somebody to come in i wanted brother fourny too but he didn't he's going somewhere else but we'll do something all right uh james 1 and 1st peter 1 and then first peter 4. so remember that remember the fellowship meeting will be at brother pageants on the first or the third saturday in july so remember those things i guess that's all announcements all right now for the weekend there you will not have to be bringing nothing you know the july it will be done here by all of us you if you want to bring a cake we always love sweets you know if you want to help us make be fatter come ahead and do the best you can we'll we'll eat and have a good time okay father we thank you lord for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for calvary and we just ask you to help us guide us lord give us understanding ears that we may hear what you have to say unto each and every one of us forgive our sins and let us stand complete in you lord and in doing that then give us the opportunity to hear and we thank you you have we just asked you to open as we were singing the eyes of our understanding for our heart that we may be able to hear your word we love you and we thank you we commit it to you now in jesus name amen all right james remember we're talking about proving and trying and things so we go to james 1 and we'll start reading it about verse 2. he said my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse temptations my brother encountered all joy when you fall into the diver's temptation knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience we let patients have our perfect work now if you want patience in the pyramid you work on some of that right but let patients have our perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that give it to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave the sea driven with the wind and tossed let not but for let not men think that he shall receive anything of the lord not that man what the waiver want watch this now the bible i love it because it makes a point a lot of times he will explain that see a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted but the rich and that he has made low it doesn't sound too good to rich man because as the flower to grace he shall pass away for the sun is no sooner risen than risen with a burning heat but it withers the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perishes for also shall so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways watch now blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he's tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him now we'll get back to that at the last there's got to be trials before the promise can come the life's trial abraham had was take that boy your only hopes up there and kill him now that was pretty hard with it now watch is where we were this morning see let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's finished bringeth forth death all right let's go over to peter 1 and we'll go about verse 6. we're in you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory were at the appearing of jesus christ 4 412 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy if you be reproached for the name of christ now watch these two if you be reproached for the name of christ if you're tested right happy are ye for the spirit of glory and god rested upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he's glorified now once now here's where you difference between the test and the temptation you remember satan tempts god test attempt is to kind of provoke you to to you know do different than the test is just a trial but let none of you suffer as a murderer now why would he go putting that in the scriptures don't not even be thinking about it well see if you go out and do a murder and they arrest you they ought to you see what he's saying let none of you suffer as a murderer boy they really they really done me dirty i killed that guy and they put me in jail well that's really something that you're really being tempted ain't you you're really being tested no that's what he's explaining verse 14 if you re reproach for the name of christ that can go into the tempting but if you've done your own you've done being as we read while ago led astray of your own lust and murdered that none of your suffer is a murderer as a thief as any of you will do her or is it busy body and other means matters yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now to try to carry on the thought and of what we were bringing this morning remember the difference between a test and a temptation because god can't tempt anybody and he can't be tempted all right the the tempting is as we said on like the order of laying something down and waiting on you to reach over and pick it up and as quick as you pick it up whamo you're in jail that is tempting and that's not even right according to the law all right you have to give the man the right to decide what to do with a bundle of money before you could arrest him of course they don't do it but that's the way it is and you're enticing emcee and those are not illegal even according to the law but then the test of a christian that is ending up talking about that maybe you have in your life something that you can remember that something happened and you was put forth as a trial there and and you uh you either failed or passed the test and remember our old way of saying things if you got a test you know and you fail it it's going to come back around right you know it's kind of got a way of working it's their way around and you're going to come back to that test but remember that part now remember what we were talking about this morning that as we read in the scripture that god cannot tempt you see and then condemn you he can permit things to work allowing it to come in your way but remember the difference between the point of saying that you're led away of your own lust that means that when it's first put there it's not too bad but then when you yield to that then you go into that and there is the tempting that comes all right do you remember this quote we gave from i know where brother branham says there's nothing can happen to you unless god permits it all right he said to satan when he you know said you considered my servant job said he's perfect upright oh he's out of way because you've got a hedge built around him you know you're just taking care of it he's your prized little kiddo you know he's your little child and you uh you just petting him he's your great-grandchild that'd have been a better way of saying it wouldn't it you know what i mean by that was the brother richard and i were talking wiltshire tying up were talking this morning about you know them the kids they didn't get to bounce on the bed uh-uh they whooped the grandkids got to bounce on the bed you know well the great grandkids they just bounce anywhere they want to yo we just keep losing it you know right and uh but we think that's the way god does but remember he doesn't have any grandchildren he's got sons and daughters and sons and daughters must be tested and tried according to the scripture and it's for our benefit was it for job's benefit or was it for god's benefit job's benefit why god knew what job was going to do but he was proud to let him be put to a test to worry that he could come forth and then after he came forth then job come to a point to where and i'll try to get to that minute in the message then job came to the point he said i know my redeemer liveth in the last days he'll stand up on the earth and i'll see him for myself he come to appoint the in his test that he passed the test once he passed the test there it is but that's what now the point i want to get if you don't get nothing out of the message today i want to ask you the question when a test is being brought we'll use job as an example as it was being tested you know on all the things happening where was god i believe we'll prove by the bible and word of god the prophet's message that god was more on the scene here with job than he'd ever been it doesn't look that way does it it looks like god just turned his back and walked away for satan get after him no you know the tests and the trials of job brought god out of heaven right come on am i right i was up in heaven when they were talking he allowed the devil to go down and get started on him and god just pulled himself up and pulled his fingers brother and made a statement i remember when i first heard it he said god came down in all of the horrible things israel done and said he visited himself like a father with his family amen and all of the things that they'd done wrong he was right there with him not gone off somewhere else so if you don't get nothing from the message get the point trials and tests brings god to you doesn't drive him away from you if we don't take them correctly we drive him away from us right so consider that now all right so we gave what the prophet said off of god in his own words that god can't tempt us he tries us and tests us he cannot tempt us but he can test us and all people but all children must go through that child training child training you give kids everything in the world spoiled brat you make them work for it they won't like you you know because they say my buddy he's got a car and he didn't work you want me to cut grass there was never no choice at home whether the kids done what they didn't have much right to argue back it was either done or consequences well i hope that's god's way of doing things a lot of time but now think about it a test or a trial is to bring you to a place that god can move on the scene in your life that doesn't sound sensible does it this to the human thinking they don't sound right does it we think oh we poured all his blessings on us he showers us you know and you know he's real good how many of you remember in your life when you first became a christian and oh you just walked in a world and you could say daddy i need something and he just give it to you you know i need this he just poured out on you then one day you said he said daddy i need something and then you're looking for daddy because you're wondering where daddy's at but as he left you no he's more on the scene than ever before just remember what god told job you can do anything you want to to him but you can't touch his life you know in doing that he couldn't touch his wife there's no record that his wife went through anything but yet what did she wind up doing why don't you curse god and die you know he said you talk like a foolish woman but no problems to her looks like she'd have been more sympathetic is my point but get on with it god had confidence in job and by an infinite god he knew what job would do but he wanted job to find out what he'd do like i said one time about brother colley i said i'm going to get him in the biggest argument that's ever been with somebody i'm going back around the corner i'm gonna listen cause you know why because i want to know what's in him i want to see how he can handle it you know all right what about the things we go through so let's start where we kind of left off on this morning where we're there in the scripture where that in deuteronomy where that the worth it you know it says if a prophet comes or a dreamer of dreams you know and they give you a sign and it come to pass but said they take you to another god he said don't believe them i said because i have sent that person to prove you now how much more of a god should we love you know than to think about that he wants to train his children you know you brothers it was in the military you know you have to go through all these tests and trials they don't take you out the first day and say all right get up over that hurdle run us a good five miles with a 90-pound pack on your back no start out real slow and gradual but after a while you know what they're very proud to be able to stand the test but in the old days i don't know what it is now but i've saw movies heard stories and that's all i've been cause i've never been there but you know that old sergeant he was done so rough and tough until i remember seeing a movie one time when they were just all their tongues lolled out you know running with that 90 pound pack and here goes the sergeant running backwards with his own saying come on boys let's go well i've always said you know it takes an old tough sergeant to make something out of you and what's the rest of my story there that's when god made me tough and put me here work do a little child training and sometimes i have to run backwards to let you know that we're still here all right sometimes i have to correct i don't like being what i am but i am what i am but let's get started maybe i'm put here for your test you know maybe i'm put here to put you through the test maybe i'm put here to be your tempter you know you get in the test it's all right look what he goes on let's get a few things and get started let's go to to number seven brother joe and we'll start with hebrews chapter four and i know bob's back there or somebody's there i always just you know brother anderson he's in california i hope he's watching in today and we say hi to him because he's there in california on his job but look where we kind of left off we had read this or part of it it's all for the hebrew book and brother branham says they got weary every time they'd get in the place where a showdown come then what would they do they'd fly loose and get weary and want to turn back and why did this happen to me you know you know what he's referring to the children of israel they were brought out of egypt and the different things you know and and all and and then when they get to gripping and complaining i remember one time they're in the bible it says that they were scrapping ten times from the time they left to the way to get to what katie's barney i believe they cropped ten times but you know each time in that i'll turn out to complain and god said come on let's go okay i'll kill a few of you come on let's go we'll get rid of this scum okay let's go we'll get rid of them worse complainers and gripers but let's go he was had them on the way to the promised land but when i got at cadiz barnea and turned down the fact that he said that land is there in front of you i've shown it to you i've given you witness of it these twelve have brought it back it's their land of milk and honey and they said we can't take it they started doubting god's word it wasn't just a sin now i know you don't like me the way i talk but you know god's not too much in a pity party pattern with all of us to where because he knows that we're going to do things right now quote your prophet he said i sin every day do you have to no are we yes well you know god just don't beat on that too heavily right i mean am i honest is that the truth ten times for the children of israel right and complain they're still on the way to the promised land but when they come and they doubted god's word that they was able to do it you ain't going now right don't you think that's where we're standing he's put up with us all these years and little pity patters and up and down and around horeb and fighting and fussing and two souls two lords and bruises and souls about time for us to cross over let's just don't doubt god's word remember i thought i'm honest now i thought we believed not that brother branham was infallible no not that he was deity no but i thought and and we know that the human element of the man made mistakes i was just quoting him and saying with his sins every day but the message the man brought is perfect amen where he would say 707 000 that's human but the message is right right well then i thought we believed the message to be in the form of the spoken word that was coming from god to us in this day that would be the same to us and we would be judged by it as it would be the literal written words of days gone by then when i read to you in quoting that god doesn't tempt you he tries you but brother dale i think he tempts me where'd you get that thought from well the bible says over here and so and so i'm just going to go to that there's one you've got that all lined up wrong okay it's all lined up wrong because it can't fit what the prophet said and it can't fit what we just read the bible god don't tempt nobody but you can spend weeks reading and building you a great case as to try to prove a tempting you're right in the devil's playground go ahead and do it because if you're going to be anything in the word of god we're going to come back to hear and face god's word that's how serious i am i'm sorry if that's not your way but look we said people come along and say why did this happen to me and watch what he said same strange thing this morning after preaching that just as hard as i could there was many came to the altar and question it why did this happen to me you see how it goes it goes over the top of the people's head he says it's the same people went over back there over here all right you mean brother dale you put all your confidence in that point i put it there as much as i humanly can roll it on up let's read a little bit more you mustn't question anything to god why'd this happen to me oh but but brother dale i'm not questioning god i'm just making a statement well your statement is a question you can't say why did this happen to me and put up what do you call them dots on the end of it where you continue the sentence you've automatically made it a question so stop put the question just quit trying to be smart look you mustn't question anything to god yeah but i don't understand i've i've always been good i've always went to church i go to services every things i can but i'm sick god knows i want to be a church but i'm sick are you going to question god and every trial is put upon you to prove you the bible says they're more precious to you than gold a trial it's more precious than gold you're praying for your kids to be saved and you turn around and look at them and they're going the other way right sometimes it's hard to believe the truth it's not an easy pity pattern thing for to do it so if god let a few light afflictions happen to you remember it's for the correction of you every son that cometh god must be chastened of god must be must first be chastened of god and try tried child train there's no exceptions that leaves you a little pity petty case out that you think is so bad nobody's in problems like me boy every son that cometh to god there's afflictions are these afflictions are done are brought brought about to see what attitude you'll take see it's god on this proving ground that's all earth is is the proving grounds and where he is trying to prove you so what do we think about it but do we believe that as much as we believe john 3 16. right i'm about to see a rest you see that's the way i believe this message if i can't get if i can't believe this message and it come out to produce what the the word says then i don't believe john 3 16. well now brother dale i believe jonathan it was wrote by god himself okay look what he says look at number eight possessing the enemy's gates you know he's going through church got all shook up so easy for a congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen the way it's supposed to be god makes it that way i've been pastor 40 40 years right at it and i have to admit sometimes that's hard to believe i've blamed the devil for doing a lot of it you know come find out god's one's doing it well i hope he forgives me i can't even just be honest see that's what peop preachers don't want to be honest tell it straight like it is you know look he said god brings tension into the church when problems start going wrong how many times i've ever told you this when things start going wrong i start looking searching for god because i know something's fixing to happen i learned that a long time ago see i don't believe that god's gone on vacation you know now i know i used to listen to the people preaching adoption back especially when we first came into the message in the uh early 70s late 60s and they wanted to preach adoption they were going through a lot of churches were but i listened to those people and i thought that's not exactly the way i see it maybe their word was right and you know but the way i saw most people was that adoption they think adoption is god coming on the scene in me the sun sees coming forth well i did never believe it that way i'm sorry because you know what i believe about adoption i've always told you it's god coming on the scene right i thought we believed the tudor the child trainer was trying to teach us the nature of the father i thought it was acting like the father not the father acting like the son see that's the way i've always believed it and people will say more blessed god when he takes out i'll be glad and i can just speak that word i said you got to get it first sensible to me you know god brings tension into the church wherever son that cometh of god must be tried and proven and tested he let sickness strike you he lets diseases come on you to test you and to prove you why to show the world that you're truly the seed of abraham now how do you want to prove your seed of abraham well bless god i'm going to raise the dead he'll see according to my understanding in the bible that it works talks about doing the works of god almost everybody explains that it's raising the dead healing and sick cat's not devils that's okay but that's not what the bible says the bible said to do the works of god is to believe them that god sins now then we put the signs and the wonders and things in a secondary form right we believe in them but we put it in another form we don't put it in number one number one is to believe the word okay show to the world that you're truly the seed of abraham he permits it by his own will he permits disaster he permits the friends to turn against you he permits all these things and turns the devil loose to tempt you remember he can't tempt you unless he turns you loose he couldn't do that with joel he took it off of him and he'll do all but take your life he could throw you on a bed of affliction he could turn your neighbors against you you can turn the church against you huh i didn't hear no amen now that i heard a few moans he can do most anything and it's god's will for him to do it amen you mean it's god's will for satan to come in a church and try to bust it up yeah now what'd brother brown will say about it he said somebody come in the church the problem start what did he say do bless god we'll get the deacon we'll throw him out the door we'll tell him he's doing that stuff around here now what'd he say pray for the person he said then the person will come in or what was the other part or he'll get out thank you right so if you want to get rid of somebody pray for them start praying for them they're going to get in or get out or what do we believe that is john 3 16. come on go look what they are it's god's will for him to do it let satan do all these things we're taught that it is more precious than gold to us i admit i've done a lot of praying here i admit i've done a lot of other things we were lying the other day when they were cleaning the church sister anna was looking up under the pews and she was thinking one thing i think in another because she said i didn't find any up under here i said but you might want to keep searching you might find them she was talking about chewing gum somebody stuck under the seat i was talking about prayer claws that i put in a lot of these seats you're going to get them and search yours you might be sitting on a prayer cloth you know what sister hannah said i give you permission to put one under mine how many would you say that and i mean seriously mean it that for me to manifest who i am to either get in or get out you know it's dangerous to hang around the bride that's the people the devil's really after okay let's go on to the next this is taken from the power of god 55. and here was moses mother in the conflict of testing of her faith you remember how old that went this whole story you know she had to put him in the arks had to push him out said okay and every child every son that cometh to god must first be tried god test your faith and look like god now look like god could just simply bypass the whole thing and don't have any appropriate way and just cut the thing off but it's better that he gives you a test and then comes to you when you're in the test the lord take this away from me no let's don't be stupid brother ryan wasn't stupid he wasn't meaning that you don't pray for the lord to take away things because we're supposed to pray for the lord to take away thanks we're supposed to pray for him to help us when we're hurting and give us some help and to do these things what's he meaning we don't pray for god to take away the test we pray for him to help us that we may be able to pass it right but it's better that he gives you a test and then comes to you when you're in the test i like that don't you how many can seriously say you like that and you just got to a horrible situation right my brother danny laying up there in that hospital he said order note he was out of his mind but for two weeks they was coming in and out and talking to him and he was talking to us for two weeks and just lifeing and we was talking about hunting and we're doing everything in intensive care and they come in and they said well we need to work on your spleen he said we'll get on with it he said order note he wouldn't awake you need to do this about get on with it you know what one day he woke up he didn't want him to do nothing but my point is what was god away from him you know i'm serious gonna try to be you know then we totally go in opposition don't we it looks like the best thing to do to get god to come to you is to get in trouble now we know that's not true and i'm just explaining something but it does seemingly but no we shouldn't do that we just should realize one thing do you realize job's name was in heaven do you realize job was a conversation piece in heaven between god and the devil right don't you ever think about maybe your name might be mentioned up there danny don't you think it's all the trouble you had maybe your name was brought up somewhere how about it at least he said satan go get him you know okay look he said i like that don't you the greatest experiences of my life is when i come up against a mountain that i can't get over it under it or around it and just stand still and god will move the thing back he will move no matter how dark the cloud is faith pierces it yonder with an eye that looks beyond everything that the devil can sit before you because god is our victory do we believe that look at the next one this is jehovah gyra 57. you're asking me to kill and destroy the only evidence that i have who's just talking about abraham the promise to kill isaac right you'll keep your word and make me a father of nations what you're asking me to kill and destroy the only evidence that i have that you'll keep your word and make me a father of nations god how god loves to test his people every child that comes to god must be tested child trained no exceptions everyone and maybe tonight that you're sick just to have a little child training just a little testing don't be discouraged god's on the throne he knows all things if we're truly born of the spirit of god everything's working together for your good. and we'll get to it a little bit wednesday where it's talking about that all things work together for the good and that are they called now i'll have a lot of trouble trying to explain it but you know that a sinner can't have a sixth sense you can have faith for the time to be healed of a disease or sickness or whatever but he can't have a sixth sense i don't care what you think you're going to wait till wednesday or a couple of weeks and we'll read what brother branham says but i've seen them people heal that's faith for the time because you can only have a sixth sense if you're born again no sinners have got no no no we're going to believe what he says or forget it right he's going to make everything right he promised he would he swore he would and he's got to keep that word he's kept it now for oh thousands of years to ever believe her would you be any exception no sir we're no exception then watch him no exception well let me get a couple more look what he says here on the message be certain of god you know god loves to test you he loves to see the reaction of your faith did you know that god loves to see how you react when you say oh lord i believe you the heart my savior i believe that you're the healer i believe you're the one who gives the holy holy spirit the things that i'm requiring you are god who gives that make an only great confession then when you confess all your sins and promise god that you will do if he'll let you get well then because it don't happen you run off like a coward well no some mercy he said god can't use that there's no way for him to use you if that's the way you are there's no way for him to answer you because he only answers by faith and all of a sudden you go away and you can't answer this real true faith stands there being sure that god is be certain that he is and if god asks this thing to be done to confess your sins and so forth and you've done it faces that he is it's certain that it's going to happen your request has to be granted oh i hope you don't miss that i'm s i'm if you're sure of god god's sure of his word is only waiting to test you like i say that people think boy we're going out of here god so loves that bride he's not going to let her go through persecution if i was you i'd read a lot and pray a lot because there's too many things a prophet says about it and i'm not going to argue with nobody about it brother dale are you a doomsday god looking for bad things happen you don't have to i preached a message 40 years ago um maybe 30. give or take 10 years i preached the messages entitled it persecution why we must have it amen you know why we must have persecution we won't line up so it gives us a test he puts us through right come on if he asks that thing to be done just confess your sins and walk into it see where it's done or not look at this next one be certain of god 1959 and the woman that she's seen those that crucial hour coming no doubt she checked up and said lord i've done all that i know how to do when you've done everything you know how to do and whatever requirement that god has required that's where faith takes a hold right you're sick now what did we read the other day brother brown says you're sick what'd he say he said first we got some home remedies you remember that one you know on the internet don't know about that just run in home remedies and you'll find it he said first we got some home remedies we try he said and then we that don't work he said we go to the doctor and he said if that don't turn out we go to god well that's being sensible right that's good steps i can't stand people that stomp their toe and they want the ambulance to come and pick them up now you've seen that at you i've seen kids stump their toe and screaming hollering mom and dad i wanted to get a stick and give them some other reasons somewhere else to get a mind off of that toe right but then you see other kids kick off the whole end of his toe he said man you need it'll be all ready to go back right come on you raised kids you know john martin them out there one time one boy hit the other mouth with a baseball bat cut clean through his lip teeth cut clean through he went in the house and he said hey look i mean he's bleeding he said put a piece of ice on his mouth a couple of days later the kid was running all right but if you've met a requirement then just stand there because you see that's where faith takes a whole faith takes a whole going to the next one i'm going to read a couple this is the god of this evil age and look what the prophet says paragraph 39 we find that this evil ages to prove what to satan she is not like eve that she is not that type of a woman she will be tried by his word no it doesn't stay there she'll be tried by the world and the things of life he says she'll be tried by his word and if it ain't a trial now i don't know where your human brain is at right two souls two lord seven thunder verse proves you no holy ghost i told you 40 years ago did you thank the two-soul doctrine at about the time of it so you think the two-soul doctrine is deceiving i said they'll come a day it'll be worse but joe's got a tape if you want to listen to it where the man is talking about how wrong brother branham is but it's so smooth until it's very very deceiving but you know right in the middle of it you know what he does he does when i ask you i said somebody falls against this message you know somebody turns against the message the first thing they do the women start cutting their hair and wearing pants painting the face why why when that's the bible to tell you not to do it you could at least be decent you know what the men started talking about well it's all right for women to cut their hair not cut it now just trim the edges to make it grow straight and and you know what he quotes brother branham now what would you do if you didn't know what brother brown said you know what he quotes and this is almost a verbatim he said brother reynolds said said that woman been cutting bangs for 25 years said she just go ahead and cut them i want the quote i've got the original what he said but you see what i'm talking about when you turn against this message you're just not going to turn against brother ryan you're going to turn against the bible and ever born again believer down through time that it stood the test right he said there's a man down here and he gave like two initials for his name said he's got more signs and wonders than brother branham had said he eclipsed brother branham and signs and wondered about three times he said you know what happened somebody said something he pulled it off right that's brother joe but we got the reason where he said it he said you say run around and said this was the life sign he said this ain't the life sign you remember that run around this is the life sign whatever he said this ain't the life sign he said that guy's got more signs than brother branham ever had you see what you're gonna do all right she will be tried by the word the bride as adam's bride was tried by the word and adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever that's all she was confused on hebrews 13 8. see but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face now the people that's called by his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word for in the beginning was of the bible man was given the word of god to live by one word misinterpreted by a man called satan in the person of an animal called the serpent right satan in this person could talk to eve and miss and interpreted the word to her and was lost see it must be every word one more possessing the case of an enemy paragraph nine god had been tested in the patriarch because he'd give him a promise and when god makes a promise he wants to be sure that this person is worthy of the promise before he fulfills what he said or what he promises if i was you i'd write that down and read it over and over so abraham had been promised that through his seed the whole world would be blessed and he'd have a son and this son out of him should come forth a seed that would bless the whole earth and then what was abraham joe take him out and kill him you remember a minute ago you mean destroy every hope to fulfill the promise and god time after time and god time after time tested him but he come to the final test before the blessing was going to happen that final test to see how you'll react he will take his promise of healing would stand just as true as we did when we stood here and accepted it no matter what the doctrine says stand just as true it's easy to go into a doctor and he says you're well and you come out and say you're well well what about when you go in and he says you're dying well i'm dying won't go die right i mean that's not being sarcastic that means true but you go into the doctor's office and he's got a medicine he says this medicine i'm going to give you today is proved to be 10 effective and 90 of the people's died with it you don't feel too good do you but you go in there and he says this medicine has been proven that we've got a 80 rate of being cured compared to a 20 percent you know death rate you're feeling pretty good right why not go to the word of god it gives you a hundred percent matter of fact gives you 120. god says you're healed what are we arguing in dumb and stupid human beings i don't want to say that i'm healed because i would be lying because i'm not healed we'll just go right ahead little pity party you're out of the word to start with the word says you're healed you're a liar to start with the word says you're healed why can't we believe it simple little counts faith and the right mental attitude remember we're still on that positive attitude i ain't nowhere close to what i want to preach i'm just laying the background well you know everybody in the bible that ever amounted to anything had a positive attitude can you see job i think maybe oh well okay a man without the holy ghost said i know there was nothing could take that away from him took his family took all of his goods he still had the same confession there's none of you and i've been through anything yet compared to anything of those in the bible that we can read off right but yeah we're so down and out when are we going to start saying what god says when are we going to start confessing and believing it brown said most of our faith is mental faith he said we'll get to it wednesday he said that most people misinterpret hope for faith that's why i've always said to you you see people that come up and tell them i got cancer immediately i'm healed i'm healed i believe god's word i'm healed i'm healed you let sight and time take over and they start dwindling away well maybe i'm not healed see you done lost it it's easy to believe when instant healing comes but you know what there's no testing of your faith with an instant healing the testing of your faith is when you have to hold on a little personal i've had to walk in this message a lot of times by myself in the basis that i was the one that believed it that way and i stood with it and i still believe it that way you may have to walk by yourself but remember what did we say test comes means god comes he's not going on vacation adoption is bringing the father on the scene not the sun on the same brings the father's nature and being into you to be displayed we're still stumbling where jesus said i go to my father and your father i go to my god and your god well it must have been two of them because jesus was going to his god sight and time the worst enemies of god we were there in 68 67 and even though the prophet had passed home it was still running a little upgrade and we'd go about talking and the upgrade then was who's to take over brother branham's call who's supposed to be the prophet who's elijah who's this and who's that you know he said he was just laying a foundation for somebody right whose folks take over is it this brother is that brother you know i remember the first time that i heard billy paul say it we was at jeffersonville indiana and he come out and he said you're wanting to know who elijah is he said i just heard today where daddy said the elijah of this day is the lord jesus christ yeah it's kind of upbeat but then it began to just dwindle away then doctrines jumped up people wanting followings pulling great groups dividing over a little split hours about the message now what is it it started another kind of upbeat but that upbeat is today more to try to get more members to the message and i believe that i believe in that but what about like i told the brother when they told them in china that you've sent us the part that shows us brother branham was a prophet i was there personally talking with the brothers that you've sent us who brother randomly is in the message says now tell us what he said what he talked i said brother don't go to the next time you're going to have one of these mystery expos that you had 200 here this year the next year are you going to have 200 plus another 100 that tim's got and then you're going to sit down and you're going to tell 300 and god sent a prophet i said put somebody out to themself with the 200 that already believed brother around was a prophet and teach them what the prophet taught and immediately that word came from from china they said come now and tell us what the prophet talked but you know you and i might not be able to go to india china we can help other people go and we've tried to help here but you know we could at least believe what we read i'm serious when brother brown says something that is not correct that's human error right but when he tells me what the bible says i count them to be the word of god i don't have to line them up they're already aligned this is god in our day showing you and i to the moth of a man the word of god why can't we believe it why can't we at least believe for healing you know are we just going to die away most of us in a place right now i like what one brother said i won't call his name because i've got in trouble calling people tonight and they said later they didn't say it but this one brother is 80 years old and he said somebody said you know lord's coming he said he better hurry up it don't make much difference because one way or the other i'm going to see him pretty quick he said i'm 80 years old a lot of you and i at a place that we better start believing one turn of the clock and you ain't got no money in the bank i don't care what you think you can do no we're still in america we'd probably be better off if we wasn't in america you know what think on these things when a trial comes god comes on the scene so we don't look around and cut our arm and want to go you know have faith to bring god we're not dumb we just know things are going to happen but also know that god is going to come why after the last test to abraham then the promise could be fulfilled there will be a final test to you and i to the believers of this message and what it is god will move on the scene to take us out of here you believe that i do man testing times wonderful hour come on brothers testing time more precious than gold you know what to be put to a test and god to say satan have you considered my servant he loves that talking to a bank man one day you know big man at the bank my point was god you know he was kind of in authority and he said sam he said you and your wife done something right he said you've raised a good family you know what that meant something to me for a man in his authority and his thinking to say that it meant something and i was very proud of that it make you feel good short hit i strutted a little you know but you know what if my kids were the worst kids that's ever been in the world my grandkids or their great-grandkids you know that they can't sin enough to not be my children i can't see this just turning against people because of this that or the other it wouldn't matter if my kids were the worst john dillingers and adolf hitler's or whatever you want to call them but still says my child i don't want to be associated with them but god ain't my family okay you send them to me you know i made the statement many years ago i said we've got a lot of people at lula that's got probably a lot of problems according to what everybody thinks they said if you don't want your problems just send them up lula we'll work on them a little we might make some jewels out of some you might have to run off a few and we'll make some jewels right was that not what they said about america is not the statement that was made back what 40s 30s or something said send us your people and we made a country that has been respected of all mankind out of the scum and office care of a lot of countries but it turned out to be america and i'm proud of it he said what are you talking about i said well this is father's day i didn't didn't get to know my natural father that much but i sure got one i'd love to talk to you about you know my father ain't always a dodea granddaddy oh i was going through a test one time and i was crying and i was just oh i just finally got in the car i don't know where in the world i was going i started out of the driveway and weighed her terrence i think it was terrence was coming in he said where are you going i don't know tell mom i'll be back in a little while and i drove down the road just crying and boo-hooing my eyeballs out about how bad it was and about that time something inside of me said who do you think you are are you comparing what you're going through with what i went through i turned the car around i started back home i was crying more than i was going the other way but it was tears of joy coming from my soul that my daddy would take that much of me did he'd have to whip me but yet he corrected me let's stand what we got boys i'm proud of these kids i'm very proud of them i love these kids these children they're singing they're doing they're working i love it oh my god all right go ahead if you don't know your daddy my daddy is your daddy we're all one in him jesus i have started listen to this oh decided it'll turn from a mental faith to a spiritual revelation take this you're dismissed remember the service is wednesday thank you oh you
