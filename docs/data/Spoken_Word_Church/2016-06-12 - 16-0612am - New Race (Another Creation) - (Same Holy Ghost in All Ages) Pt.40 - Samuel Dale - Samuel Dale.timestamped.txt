[21:24] creation of God and who are we the rest
[21:27] of that creation all right so now we go
[21:30] to Second Peter 1 to read from verse 1-8
[21:36] Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of
[21:38] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[21:40] like Precious Faith with us through the
[21:43] righteousness of God and our Savior
[21:45] Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[21:47] multiplied unto you through the
[21:49] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[21:53] according as his divine power hath given
[21:56] unto us all things that pertain unto
[22:00] life and godliness through the knowledge
[22:02] of him that hath called us to glory and
[22:05] virtue whereby are given unto us
[22:08] exceeding great and precious promises
[22:11] that by these you might be partakers of
[22:13] the divine nature having escaped the
[22:15] corruption that is in the world through
[22:17] lust and beside this now having that's
[22:20] that's the new birth we're going getting
[22:22] to those parts right and then now he's
[22:24] going to tell us how the growth
[22:26] development happens and besid this
[22:28] giving all diligence add to your faith
[22:31] virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to
[22:33] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[22:35] patience and to patience godliness and
[22:38] to Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[22:40] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[22:42] things be in you and abound they make
[22:45] you that ye shall neither be Barren nor
[22:48] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[22:51] Jesus Christ you may be seated in the
[22:53] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[22:56] the word
[23:05] now we're trying
[23:08] to get to a place of understanding and
[23:11] seeing the hour and the time that we're
[23:13] living and we look around and see how
[23:16] everything is Fally coming to a close as
[23:19] far as uh the Natural Things of life is
[23:23] is working out and you know everything's
[23:26] falling apart but we're not supposed to
[23:29] be concerned with that we're supposed to
[23:30] be concerned about our
[23:32] spiritual uh makeup of our being instead
[23:36] of the world that's that's all let going
[23:38] in anyway but you know to our makeup and
[23:42] our point of where we are because that's
[23:44] what we're trying to do and as we'll get
[23:46] to it on into the message see Peter is
[23:50] writing to
[23:52] people that had the same Holy Ghost
[23:56] experience our new birth
[23:58] that he had amen all right and then
[24:00] writing to them now then he's to you
[24:04] know he's writing to those people but
[24:06] lit listen
[24:08] now don't you ever think about the Bible
[24:12] as being something
[24:14] personal amen right amen all right see
[24:19] Peter's now listen Peter is not just
[24:22] writing to them back there
[24:25] right when we read this and read it with
[24:28] right understanding you realize he's
[24:31] talking to you and
[24:33] I right he's not you know we we say well
[24:38] he was back there talking to them and he
[24:40] was doing it no the Bible is supposed to
[24:43] be to you and
[24:45] I what they see and what others have
[24:48] seen before us has got to be the same
[24:50] way that's righten you've got to have
[24:53] your own experience in Jesus Christ and
[24:58] it's not that like we Baptist used to
[25:00] believe and say well we got the Holy
[25:02] Ghost and of course he doesn't like to
[25:04] use the word ghost a lot but they'd say
[25:06] we got the Holy Spirit you'd say well
[25:08] how do you know you got well it come on
[25:09] to day of
[25:11] Pentecost if you wouldn't ever there you
[25:13] wouldn't hear that but brother uh Lis is
[25:17] shaking his head a little bit because
[25:19] that's the way we were speaking we were
[25:22] saying well hey we got it because it
[25:24] come back to our well what does that
[25:27] matter no right you know that would be
[25:29] like saying uh well I've got corn in my
[25:33] garden why because there was corn me uh
[25:38] you know 4,000 6,000 years ago there was
[25:42] corn and I've got it no it ain't until I
[25:45] plan it I've had trouble doing that but
[25:49] you know but trying to get to a point of
[25:52] seeing that the Bible is speaking to you
[25:55] and
[25:56] I is it is not just talking to these
[25:59] people
[26:01] here Peter was telling these people here
[26:05] how to attain unto the place where he
[26:08] was but that's supposed to be
[26:10] transmitted down to you and I to where
[26:14] that it's speaking personally to you
[26:17] that's have you ever noticed in Malachi
[26:19] we know we we quote that a lot Malachi 4
[26:21] says behold I send
[26:23] you Elijah the prophet that's right all
[26:27] right
[26:28] see then you make it
[26:29] personal you remember brother Brown's
[26:31] wife she was reading that and she wasn't
[26:34] she was wondering what did the mared
[26:35] brother brandom or not and she read that
[26:37] and it says behold I send you Elijah the
[26:40] prophet well we ought to make all of
[26:42] those things personal to us amen right
[26:46] all the scriptures should be speaking to
[26:48] you and I as Wade was saying one time we
[26:50] talk about Abraham and his faith but
[26:53] that was back there that was another man
[26:56] that was another situation that was
[26:57] another another time see you and I must
[27:00] have the experience of Jesus Christ
[27:02] personally to us and then the Bible is
[27:05] written to you and
[27:06] I all right now we tried too much you
[27:09] know we've tried two or three services
[27:11] talking
[27:12] about
[27:14] that Peter is saying that he's speaking
[27:17] to them of like Precious Faith that's
[27:21] right now the Bible listen to me the
[27:24] Bible is not written to the World am you
[27:29] say well no just
[27:32] listen the Bible is only written to
[27:35] those that are in Christ
[27:37] Jesus because the the Bible says no man
[27:40] can call Jesus the Christ except it be
[27:43] by the new birth right Born Again
[27:46] experience baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[27:48] words you use all right so then in in
[27:51] that we ought to consider and think
[27:54] about it that it's a wonderful thing
[27:56] that we can be able to read it because
[27:58] it's written personally to you and
[28:02] I well that's for somebody else to do
[28:05] that's for the no no how would you put
[28:08] Hebrews 13:8 there that's
[28:10] right Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same
[28:13] what yesterday today and forever all
[28:19] right whatever he has been he has to
[28:22] still be and what he is now he has to
[28:26] always be
[28:28] right to make it correct all right so
[28:30] then we'd have it in the line see not
[28:33] not saying that it's well it's so much
[28:36] this is for them and this is for that
[28:37] and this is for this no he's the same
[28:40] yesterday today and forever the people's
[28:42] the one that
[28:44] changes
[28:45] right and we change because of what
[28:48] we're
[28:49] taught right the churches we were in the
[28:52] things uh you know it's that's our
[28:57] problem
[28:58] is what we've been
[28:59] taught right now not throwing off on
[29:02] anybody that taught it cuz thank God for
[29:04] people that did teach us amen right
[29:07] thank God for somebody that the Bible
[29:09] would say even if Jesus is preached Why
[29:12] by contention which means argument you
[29:14] know no no no we're not supposed to
[29:16] argue but the Bible said if it's
[29:18] preached even by arguing somebody
[29:20] sitting around could hear it amen and
[29:23] receive it where the two that would be
[29:25] arguing might be be both of them lost
[29:29] all right but see it's it's to you and I
[29:33] it's not written and that's what I'm
[29:35] trying to deal with
[29:38] now to try to talk
[29:41] about that if there has ever
[29:44] been now let's take Hebrews 13:8 in the
[29:47] right way the same yesterday today and
[29:50] forever if there's anybody that was
[29:53] ever saved born again whatever you want
[29:56] to use him to
[29:58] terminologies and if anybody else ever
[30:00] reaches that
[30:03] place then God is
[30:05] obligated to give them the new birth
[30:09] right amen okay so then we go to the
[30:12] scripture where he said and the promis
[30:14] is unto
[30:17] you your
[30:21] children to them that are far
[30:24] off Gentiles coming on down towards us
[30:27] right and then to the entire
[30:30] world all right see if ever anybody ever
[30:33] received that's where our points we try
[30:36] to we try to uh uh what would you call
[30:40] it we try to theor theorize it or figure
[30:44] out some Theory you know and and try to
[30:48] make it look good about our thoughts but
[30:51] you know why make it that way why not
[30:54] this be what the Bible says am and if
[30:57] anybody ever received the baptism of the
[31:00] Holy Spirit
[31:03] anywhere then if it's not offered
[31:05] forever age thereafter then he's not
[31:08] Hebrews 13:8 that's
[31:10] right now we know that it came onto
[31:12] death Pentecost right we read about it
[31:15] coming on the day of Pentecost but what
[31:17] good is that as I said a moment ago what
[31:20] good is that until it happens to you and
[31:24] me right see
[31:27] then why would we not hold to the
[31:30] point that it's the same yes but now
[31:34] brother Dale you you you you're you're
[31:36] you know you got to put this here you
[31:38] got to put this here with that
[31:43] why if there was ever any person ever
[31:47] received the baptism of the Holy
[31:51] Ghost right that's right and any person
[31:55] ever re reach that position
[31:58] again God would be obligated
[32:01] right if anybody was ever
[32:04] healed
[32:06] true if you believe the same way that
[32:09] person did that was healed God's
[32:11] obligated to heal you not obligated
[32:14] because of obligated to be you he's
[32:16] obligated because he said he
[32:19] would it's not obligated to me and you
[32:22] as people God owes us nothing we owe him
[32:26] everything
[32:27] but yet he said he would do
[32:30] it
[32:32] right see then the Bible then is not
[32:36] written to
[32:37] sinners now a sinner can pick it up and
[32:40] read it you don't
[32:42] misunderstand a sinner can pick up the
[32:44] Bible and read it right and he can come
[32:48] to the point of getting saved
[32:51] right but you're not putting the Bible
[32:53] in the correct
[32:54] order because it's not written to him
[32:58] it's written
[33:00] to the person that becomes born again
[33:03] like to me if I was overseas and I'd
[33:05] write my wife a letter and I'd say tell
[33:08] the church I said hello and so and so
[33:10] and so and so y'all do this out of the
[33:11] other that that's part of the
[33:14] letter but who's the letter
[33:15] [Music]
[33:17] to I'm not writing to the church I'm
[33:20] writing to her to tell her what to tell
[33:22] the
[33:23] church see something
[33:25] personal all
[33:28] right see then we spent a lot of time
[33:30] going through uh justification
[33:33] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[33:35] Ghost and coming down to each stage and
[33:38] and transpiring and then we come to here
[33:40] where Peter and Peter is writing this
[33:44] letter and it's speaking to you and I so
[33:47] think about it Simon Peter a servant and
[33:51] Apostle of Jesus Christ to them to
[33:55] you
[33:57] that have
[33:59] obtained like Precious
[34:02] Faith
[34:04] what with
[34:06] us
[34:08] right how through the righteousness of
[34:11] God and our Savior Jesus Christ who's he
[34:13] writing to he's not writing to the world
[34:16] y That's right he's writing to those
[34:19] that are in Christ
[34:21] Jesus right amen we went over that and
[34:24] over that last week and and and all and
[34:27] if you ever need any more I've got
[34:29] plenty of them you ought to see what's
[34:30] stacked on my desk at
[34:34] home see we went we read some of these
[34:36] and I didn't give these to them but
[34:38] brother brandham said on the message
[34:40] earnestly contending for the faith he
[34:42] said it's he's addressing this to the
[34:44] church not to the outside world
[34:50] right it's not two the Bible he's
[34:52] talking about Jude and he's talking
[34:54] about Ephesians two scriptures all right
[34:56] he goes on over the believer's position
[34:58] in Christ to the faithful in Christ
[35:01] Jesus now this letter is addressed to
[35:04] those not to the world outside world not
[35:09] to see now watch not a
[35:12] sermon CU now listen I readon I brought
[35:14] this one because you see a sermon is a
[35:18] sermon to
[35:20] everybody right see I'm preaching a
[35:24] sermon that means the Lost can hear hear
[35:27] it and the saved can hear it and through
[35:30] the
[35:31] sermon The Sinner can come to the
[35:35] position of getting to Salvation right
[35:38] that's right see but it's not to him
[35:40] amen but it's a sermon part now watch to
[35:43] the faithful in Christ Jesus now this
[35:45] letter is addressed to those that's not
[35:48] to the outside the
[35:50] world not it's not a sermon Paul wasn't
[35:54] preaching here to the unsaved saved this
[35:58] is written to the Ephesians watch it he
[36:00] was preaching to the
[36:02] saved the called out the separated and
[36:05] set aside and faithful in the call see
[36:08] he's not the Bible is not
[36:10] written the position of a believer in
[36:13] Christ that was believer's position in
[36:15] Christ says this epistle the letter to
[36:18] the Ephesians was written to Believers
[36:21] not to the outside world this is
[36:24] Believers yes see
[36:27] it's not far the outside world I gave
[36:29] you a bunch but I've got a bunch more
[36:31] anybody wants them you're welcome to
[36:33] read where your Prophet said there but
[36:36] listen let me state it this
[36:39] way why can't we believe
[36:43] truth no matter who says
[36:48] it I don't mind quoting uh Billy
[36:52] Graham I don't mind quoting the Pope
[36:56] yeah I have no problem if he's telling
[36:59] the
[37:01] truth right I have no problem amening
[37:04] what he's saying if it's the
[37:07] truth why because it's the word of
[37:10] God well as I say in the start why
[37:12] couldn't we believe it then that if
[37:14] anybody ever receive the Holy
[37:17] Spirit
[37:18] anywhere than any other person down
[37:21] through there and that's what the
[37:23] scripture said and many as the Lord Our
[37:24] God shall call and brought it brought
[37:26] around
[37:27] say he said as long as he's
[37:30] calling the
[37:32] apostolic blessing is in succession or
[37:35] is available to you and I as long as
[37:38] he's calling amen but see we want to
[37:41] make it to where we we we want to do and
[37:43] I'll read the quote in a
[37:45] minute where brother Brown says we get
[37:47] this enough Holy
[37:49] Ghost till we quit lying and
[37:53] cheating we said God wants us to grow
[37:57] but you see that's the part of it we say
[37:59] well it's not here well why cuz I don't
[38:01] believe
[38:05] it now who gave you the right to say you
[38:08] don't believe it right that's right well
[38:11] I got a right to say I don't believe it
[38:12] okay go ahead and say you don't believe
[38:13] cuz that's where it's going to kill you
[38:17] okay do you mean it's not right just
[38:19] because you don't believe it
[38:23] yeah I remember one one time brother
[38:25] Brandon was going over to was talking
[38:27] about going to Africa and this man wrote
[38:29] him a letter and the way he wrote the
[38:31] letter he said
[38:33] we we don't want you over here because
[38:35] of you believe in this this this or this
[38:37] or this they come and find out that we
[38:40] was the one
[38:41] man you know it was him one man there
[38:46] was no we to it but see it's easy to say
[38:49] we we don't believe it this way one
[38:52] brother he used to say uh we don't
[38:54] believe it we We believe We believe I
[38:56] wanted to say well why do you
[39:00] believe I don't want to know what we
[39:02] believe in Lula Georgia as a group amen
[39:06] come on I want to know what we believe
[39:08] as individuals that make up a
[39:13] group then is not
[39:17] we it's those that are in Christ Jesus
[39:20] that's
[39:21] right but you see that's the doctrine
[39:24] that I told you that that in the statute
[39:26] of perfect man we just read in Peter
[39:28] some believes you get everything when
[39:29] you born again you got every bit of
[39:30] these things he's writing the other
[39:32] group believes you don't get nothing
[39:33] hardly you know just just enough to be a
[39:37] a better
[39:39] person and then when you'd say well well
[39:43] brother Brandon said it's the same holy
[39:44] ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost
[39:46] you know I don't believe that well who
[39:48] give you the right to say you don't
[39:50] believe
[39:51] it are you the
[39:53] prophet are we supposed to follow you
[39:58] yeah there's the we there's the point
[40:01] that we get
[40:03] right but see why wouldn't we believe
[40:06] you know you know you could walk right
[40:09] across over here to these
[40:11] church and they're Baptist
[40:14] basic and you could say Hebrews
[40:18] 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[40:20] today and forever and if anybody ever
[40:23] received the new
[40:25] birth then it would have to be for every
[40:28] person in every age and every time that
[40:32] would ever believe it the correct way
[40:34] you know why they say amen that's right
[40:36] you know why cuz they've never been
[40:39] taught the things of the people of the
[40:41] message has been taught amen that's
[40:44] right some of you have said and heard
[40:47] yes that the Holy Ghost is not here like
[40:49] it was in the book of
[40:53] Acts well I'm not against that part
[40:57] I'm glad the Lord showed that to to a
[40:59] sister she come to me other day she said
[41:01] brother Dale said the Lord spoke to me
[41:03] told me
[41:04] said you're not just trying to tell us
[41:06] we're
[41:09] lost you're trying to tell us you know
[41:12] we're lost and we need to be saved
[41:14] that's fine cuz that's in it but you're
[41:16] telling us that we're saved cuz see I
[41:19] can't talk to you until you get born
[41:20] again as the same Holy Spirit that's
[41:24] right right that's right see I the words
[41:27] I come across will be a sermon to you
[41:30] right that's what Paul that's right a
[41:33] sermon a sermon can bring a sinner to
[41:36] Christ right but then when a sinner
[41:39] comes to Christ he's just a baby he
[41:42] needs something to help him
[41:44] grow so that's what Peter was saying
[41:48] I've received this
[41:50] faith I have this precious Faith
[41:54] yes and I'm speaking speaking to those
[41:57] that have the same precious faith that I
[42:01] have amen
[42:04] right see then it's not written that way
[42:07] to the world
[42:11] Amen it's written to those that are in
[42:13] Christ Jesus
[42:15] okay see then that that to me you've got
[42:19] to put it that away CU how else could
[42:20] you put it you say well I just don't
[42:23] believe it cuz I don't see it open your
[42:25] eyes
[42:28] open your
[42:32] eyes and like I said the other day do
[42:34] you
[42:37] realize that this message has went
[42:40] around the
[42:41] world for the people of the land where
[42:44] has that ever been in
[42:49] time yeah Paul they had had the Known
[42:51] World note of Paul yeah that's the only
[42:54] time you have any thoughts whatsoever
[42:56] and it certainly didn't cover the world
[42:57] his message has gone around the
[43:02] world that in itself is a miracle
[43:06] Amen to realize that people that never
[43:10] had an opportunity to hear about Jesus
[43:13] Christ can hear a prophet speaking about
[43:17] Jesus
[43:19] Christ not just somebody talking about
[43:21] it or some point that's
[43:23] right what a wonderful thing amen but we
[43:26] think well well we just don't see it
[43:28] don't see what like I told you and I
[43:30] know see you you people get upset with
[43:32] me when I make statements but I've ask
[43:34] you to be sensible go to the book of
[43:36] Acts and write down how many miracles
[43:38] happened in the book of
[43:42] Acts read the book of Acts and write
[43:44] down how many miracles took place how
[43:47] many healings how many of the Dead
[43:48] raised how many of this and you know
[43:50] what brother random
[43:52] says he said there was more in one
[43:55] service than his
[43:56] ministry in the entire book of
[44:00] Acts I named off the other day a lot of
[44:03] things that had happened right here per
[44:06] number would be more than the Miracles
[44:09] in the book of
[44:12] Acts but yet you don't believe it
[44:15] because see now there's the point I'm
[44:19] not trying to tell you you're
[44:21] lost you must find out from God whether
[44:23] you're lost or not I'm trying to talk to
[44:26] you about
[44:28] salvation and what it is to be saved
[44:32] amen I'm not against anything like
[44:36] that listen I I'm not trying to preach
[44:39] to condemn people that don't believe the
[44:42] way that I believe okay I've never done
[44:45] that I've tried to tell the truth
[44:49] amen I've tried to preach the
[44:51] truth that's my goal is to preach the
[44:54] truth amen all right not to try to tell
[44:57] somebody else they're
[45:00] wrong but to try to preach the truth to
[45:03] where that you and I can have an
[45:08] opportunity I want my family I want this
[45:12] church to have an opportunity to hear
[45:15] the
[45:18] truth well who do you think you are I'm
[45:21] me who do you think you are solve that
[45:24] problem right right
[45:27] what's the point of bringing up that
[45:28] thought we I I'm a pastor of a church
[45:31] trying to to direct a group of people
[45:34] into the word of God to see where Christ
[45:36] is at sir into our hearts and our lives
[45:39] not what's out there youve never heard
[45:42] me get up here and preach long sermons
[45:44] about the woman getting in the White
[45:45] House and Russia coming after oil and
[45:48] all these things and just Bo more people
[45:50] just sit there and just shout and holler
[45:52] and scream when they hear those things
[45:54] and you start talking about salvation
[45:57] you start getting down where people live
[46:02] at I'm just trying to get you to
[46:05] think think for yourself what is that
[46:07] old saying I don't like his modern
[46:09] terminologies what is that think out of
[46:12] the
[46:12] box well that don't fit me I'm not in
[46:17] the box that's right
[46:19] amen
[46:21] right it's supposed to mean think for
[46:23] yourself right because the box is what
[46:27] everybody else think and you think out
[46:28] of the box that's just a simple
[46:30] terminology I know what these things are
[46:32] about but that don't fit to me why I
[46:35] want to talk to you about thinking out
[46:36] of the box outside the box or something
[46:39] I want to touch that Soul that's within
[46:43] that to where that you can make a
[46:45] decision
[46:48] yourself go that's
[46:52] salvation that's salvation for you to
[46:55] make your your own decision all
[46:58] right and we spent a lot of time talking
[47:01] about the new birth and how that it
[47:04] would would be that you know that we
[47:06] need these things that's right right but
[47:10] now we've come to the place of reaching
[47:13] a position to where that we're talking
[47:15] about what these
[47:17] disciples were talking about
[47:22] okay but see there's where we go see we
[47:24] go well I don't see like it is in the
[47:26] book of Acts why not
[47:29] wow now I'm asking you a simple question
[47:32] you be simple
[47:33] yourself if Jesus Christ is not here
[47:36] today just like he was in the book of
[47:39] Acts then Hebrews 13:8 is
[47:44] wrong the problem is you and
[47:47] I the problem is not God it's never been
[47:50] the holy ghost that was taken away show
[47:52] me that in the prophet's message or the
[47:54] Bible right it was never the holy spirit
[47:57] that was taken
[47:59] away it was the word that began to be
[48:03] ate down because of our interpretations
[48:07] and ideas and things and God can only
[48:09] work according to the amount of word
[48:12] that's is there
[48:14] amen right right but are you going to
[48:18] tell me that Luther and them didn't have
[48:21] the new
[48:22] birth exactly like the day of
[48:24] Pentecost
[48:26] right then where's Hebrews
[48:30] 13:8 if you're going to say that we
[48:32] don't have it
[48:34] today y you know what a brother said to
[48:37] me one time he asked me a question about
[48:38] it he was sincere I tried to be sincere
[48:42] he was saying that nobody had the Holy
[48:44] Ghost like it was in the book of
[48:46] Acts I said well brother brand was the
[48:48] one that said it now I'm not telling you
[48:49] that I'm and I'm telling you what
[48:51] brother brandham said he said he met
[48:53] people with the Holy Spirit the same as
[48:56] the day of
[48:57] Pentecost 50 years before yes he said
[49:01] what do you think's wrong I said listen
[49:03] I'm going to answer your question this
[49:06] way I think a lot of people don't have
[49:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[49:12] right but I'm not saying no way would I
[49:15] say that nobody didn't have it
[49:19] right I'm just saying a lot of people
[49:21] ain't got it and think they got it
[49:24] that's right because what wrong I
[49:26] thought the Holy Spirit was to lead us
[49:27] to the
[49:30] word amen well let's see you signs and
[49:33] wonders let's
[49:35] see where has it ever been signs and
[49:38] wonders your Prophet said it had to be
[49:40] the word
[49:43] first right what does the Bible
[49:46] say these signs shall run before the
[49:49] Believers no that ain't exactly what the
[49:52] Bible said these signs shall follow thee
[49:55] them that
[49:58] believe so you're trying to get
[50:01] signs some kind of a doing brother Brown
[50:03] would speak of signs and
[50:05] wonders and speak of the Holy Ghost
[50:07] being
[50:09] here that's what we want to get to in
[50:11] the message but what I'm trying to do is
[50:13] to is to make sure you
[50:17] understand the Bible is
[50:19] [Music]
[50:20] written to them that have obtained like
[50:24] Precious Faith let's solve
[50:26] that right whether we want to talk about
[50:29] gifts and signs and wonders and what
[50:31] this is the Bible says Jesus Christ the
[50:36] same yesterday today and forever now are
[50:39] you going to say the Bible's
[50:42] wrong no you're going to say I don't
[50:44] understand it that way well then what do
[50:46] you mean if you don't understand it that
[50:48] way what do you
[50:50] mean come on it's time to be blunt and
[50:52] plain what do you mean if you believe
[50:56] he's not the same then you got to have
[50:58] some reason for not believing
[51:02] him I thought we believed that the
[51:05] cankerworm pmer worm Locust and the
[51:07] caterpillar ate the word
[51:11] down but I thought we were supposed to
[51:14] believe that justification
[51:17] sanctification and the baptism of the
[51:19] Holy Ghost and the prophet coming on the
[51:21] scene was to bring that back exactly
[51:23] like the scripture said it was amen
[51:26] right
[51:28] y
[51:30] y and you can see that Christ is here
[51:33] but see he's addressing this not to the
[51:38] world but to those that have escaped the
[51:41] corruption we
[51:43] read he's addressing this to the
[51:47] church all
[51:49] right he's addressing it to those that
[51:52] are in Christ Jesus amen okay y now
[51:59] then by addressing it to the same people
[52:02] that had the same experience he had
[52:06] Faith the Born Again experience
[52:09] Faith right here at the bottom of the
[52:11] pyramid Faith am all right the new birth
[52:16] whatever you want to call it Born Again
[52:17] experience New Birth baptism of the Holy
[52:19] Ghost to me it's all one and the
[52:23] same one is not a little bit and other
[52:25] there's a whole lot more and this a more
[52:27] no it's the same that's
[52:30] right but see think about it
[52:33] then Peter what are you doing who are
[52:36] you writing to to those that are in
[52:39] Christ Jesus Lula
[52:43] Georgia he's writing to you and I
[52:45] sitting here
[52:47] today
[52:49] right we claim to have the new birth
[52:52] right
[52:53] amen we claim cl to have that baptism of
[52:56] the holy spirit that new birth the Born
[52:58] Again
[53:00] experience my wife said the other day
[53:02] said why do you keep saying all them
[53:03] three together I want you to realize I
[53:05] believe all three of them the same
[53:09] thing it is the one and the same
[53:12] thing you want the ones that I got lay
[53:15] on my desk at the house where brother
[53:16] Randon says or maybe they're in the
[53:18] office where brother BR says there's not
[53:21] but one Holy Spirit there is not two
[53:23] holy spirits
[53:26] that is
[53:27] right right there's not but one New
[53:30] Birth there's many feelings but one
[53:34] birth they had one
[53:38] birth in the book of Acts but then they
[53:40] had many
[53:41] feelings every time they would meet the
[53:44] Holy Spirit would come down and would be
[53:46] great things
[53:48] right so you say but I'd like to see
[53:50] that
[53:51] again well what you're never going to
[53:54] see it do you believe it that's
[53:56] right that's right sin's not believing
[54:00] right the Bible doesn't say that the
[54:02] Bible says believe to
[54:06] see right right I believe to see okay
[54:10] amen cuz if you're waiting on something
[54:13] you can
[54:16] see but see that's where people don't
[54:18] want you to do that they don't want you
[54:20] they think you're trying to make
[54:21] something out of yourself to tell about
[54:24] experiences
[54:27] maybe we'll do it one day I'm looking at
[54:30] people that have had experiences of
[54:32] things that take
[54:35] place while we were rejoicing the other
[54:37] day sister had trouble with her hand her
[54:43] arm she couldn't raise it up couldn't do
[54:46] with
[54:47] it she just raised it
[54:51] up
[54:54] right well see we don't well that could
[54:57] be anything you know that could be
[54:58] mentally well praise God it
[55:00] happened whether it be mental spiritual
[55:02] or whatever it happened let's see you do
[55:06] it
[55:08] oh no see we don't believe it because it
[55:11] don't happen to
[55:13] us
[55:16] right but why not why can't we believe
[55:19] it because the word says
[55:23] it but Peter
[55:25] Peter who are you writing to I'm writing
[55:28] to them that have had the same New Birth
[55:32] that I've had not the growth development
[55:35] of the stature of a perfect man no they
[55:37] were up into here because that was
[55:39] coming into he had taught them for three
[55:41] and a half
[55:43] years but the 3,000 outside only heard
[55:46] one sermon that's why it was called
[55:49] babes in Christ Earnest of our
[55:51] inheritance but you know what they
[55:53] receive the same holy Spirit come on get
[55:56] Peter on over there to K's
[55:59] house come on K's house it only heard
[56:02] one or two little sermons or something
[56:04] or what had happened and sent for Peter
[56:06] to come and Peter comes over and what he
[56:08] said who can forbid these to be baptized
[56:11] see and they receive the Holy Spirit as
[56:13] we did at the
[56:17] beginning right
[56:20] right you see Church where we're at
[56:22] don't you yes so then Peter what are you
[56:25] going to do I want to tell you how to
[56:30] come to the place that I have
[56:34] obtained now this light precious
[56:37] faith that I
[56:42] have he'd come down through verse 1 2 3
[56:45] 4 5 right along in there everywhere it's
[56:47] come to the
[56:48] point and he's talking about they that
[56:51] had obtained to like Precious faith
[56:55] all right then he says add to your faith
[57:02] virtue
[57:04] no add to your
[57:08] faith
[57:10] virtue okay now he's going to tell you
[57:13] how to come on up through the the
[57:15] pyramid as to where he was at but he's
[57:19] having to relate it back to where that
[57:21] everybody would start it the same so
[57:23] it's your faith right now Faith is not a
[57:27] virtue that's right that's
[57:29] right faith is a birth
[57:34] amen like I told you babies are not born
[57:37] with
[57:39] virtues they must develop virtues as
[57:41] they live but they're
[57:45] birthed see then we must be borned again
[57:49] and how are we born again justification
[57:52] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[57:54] Ghost right amen that's right bringing
[57:58] you to the New Birth
[58:00] amen and Peter said all right now you
[58:02] got the new
[58:06] birth but said now what I want you to do
[58:08] is listen he said add to your new
[58:12] birth he said well how do you know
[58:13] that's a new birth we're going to let
[58:14] brother randam read it okay you're
[58:16] supposed to done listen to the message
[58:18] it over and over the statue of perfect
[58:20] man Blasphemous names
[58:23] know yes see then it shouldn't be any
[58:26] strange thing to read from it unless you
[58:29] do like you do with me maybe you sleep
[58:31] through half of it and don't hear I told
[58:33] you about the brother the other day he
[58:34] said what I heard of the message I
[58:39] believe
[58:42] well
[58:44] okay good
[58:46] point but listen we've done read these
[58:49] and come down with it but I want to get
[58:51] the main point or thought into your mind
[58:54] today
[58:55] that it's always been the same Holy
[58:58] Spirit in every age
[59:02] amen the Holy Ghost has been the same in
[59:05] every age mankind is what is
[59:09] different you can only manifest what you
[59:14] have has been revealed to you right
[59:17] that's right see then Peter says what he
[59:21] says You must he said you first he said
[59:25] add to your
[59:27] faith now let's take brother brandom and
[59:29] let him read it to where you can follow
[59:32] that point and you'll see what he's
[59:34] talking about go ahead now to paragraph
[59:36] 141 number one on your
[59:40] notes listen to him so he's reading
[59:43] Peter coming down and bringing it
[59:46] bringing it uh let's see 141 you got to
[59:50] you got to one you got to 33 go up to
[59:52] 141 uh you got to 18 go to
[59:55] one that's 1 a was the one we was using
[59:58] there a moment ago same thing you can we
[1:00:01] can read it but going up to paragraph
[1:00:03] which would be number one instead of one
[1:00:06] a I mess them up on that cuz I put one a
[1:00:09] and then one b and but go ahead is
[1:00:12] paragraph
[1:00:14] 141
[1:00:16] look now here is what to do what's the
[1:00:20] first
[1:00:20] thing now brother around was explaining
[1:00:23] Peter right have faith and be born
[1:00:28] again that's laying the foundation now
[1:00:30] what's the
[1:00:31] foundation what's the foundation to the
[1:00:34] pyramid Faith that's right everything up
[1:00:37] through here is going to be a
[1:00:39] manifestation of a greater Faith amen
[1:00:43] and it will be Faith but it's just
[1:00:45] difference as it's working through what
[1:00:46] you're doing with it we're not into that
[1:00:48] yet we're just getting into these parts
[1:00:51] look he said have faith and be born born
[1:00:54] again and there's your faith that Peter
[1:00:57] says add to your faith virtues see all
[1:01:00] right so to get this Faith what do we do
[1:01:03] says watch then after you lay the
[1:01:06] foundationally secondly you add to your
[1:01:08] foundation he add to your faith you got
[1:01:10] to get the foundation first first pour
[1:01:13] your foundation Faith then your to then
[1:01:16] to your faith at virtue amen now listen
[1:01:20] it's called your faith yes I know I've
[1:01:24] been through this I'll keep going over
[1:01:26] and
[1:01:27] over because it's clicking to some and
[1:01:30] some are realizing what's taking place
[1:01:32] so if I have to repeat it I don't worry
[1:01:33] about it I didn't realize I remembered
[1:01:36] it after it was said brother Donnie said
[1:01:39] that he remembered me saying in the
[1:01:40] seals years ago that said when I get
[1:01:44] through and this come out to this place
[1:01:45] said I'll start back and I'll preach
[1:01:47] justification sanctification and the
[1:01:50] baptism of the Holy
[1:01:51] Ghost CU see there's nothing new in the
[1:01:54] Bible
[1:01:55] it's all that it's all the new birth the
[1:01:58] seals of plagues the vows of Thunders
[1:02:01] all is to bring the revelation of Jesus
[1:02:03] Christ not the revelation of the
[1:02:06] Antichrist it's revelation of Jesus
[1:02:08] Christ to you all right look see then
[1:02:11] you add Faith go go ahead with number
[1:02:15] the next one number two this is
[1:02:18] paragraph 102 notice you must be born
[1:02:21] again and when you're born again you
[1:02:23] can't be born again in without having
[1:02:25] faith that's right so you see on my
[1:02:28] chart here I got the very Foundation
[1:02:31] faith is a foundation of all of it for
[1:02:33] without faith it is impossible to
[1:02:35] believe God okay now listen it's your
[1:02:39] faith what is the new
[1:02:42] birth what is the new
[1:02:45] birth is it not the birth of the
[1:02:48] word right you received the word and the
[1:02:52] Word was quickened to you by the Holy
[1:02:54] Spirit right all that we talk down
[1:02:56] through there justification same all
[1:02:58] right what is it what is the new birth
[1:03:01] it's the Born Again experience is Christ
[1:03:04] coming to live in you but he give it to
[1:03:06] you and it's called
[1:03:07] yours why would Peter say that add to
[1:03:10] your
[1:03:12] faith he didn't say add Faith right
[1:03:17] we're going to get to that when we get
[1:03:18] down to where that we're going to have
[1:03:19] to talk about the how many ads cuz
[1:03:22] brother Brown said there's only seven
[1:03:23] ads now you look up and down through
[1:03:25] there you got a lot of things but he
[1:03:27] says there seven
[1:03:31] ads all right but just stay here with me
[1:03:36] do we get to that point see because
[1:03:39] what's he doing faith is the foundation
[1:03:42] of all
[1:03:43] things so he gives you listen he gives
[1:03:47] you the new birth he births the word in
[1:03:51] you that makes you and him one
[1:03:54] right in the new birth but it's your new
[1:03:58] birth you are the one that's born again
[1:04:02] right so it's your faith amen that's
[1:04:06] right this is my eye the prophet said
[1:04:08] God gave it to
[1:04:11] me he gave the new birth on the day of
[1:04:14] Pentecost that's
[1:04:16] right right see then faith is not a
[1:04:20] virtue it's a birth that's right you got
[1:04:23] to have something to start with a baby
[1:04:27] is not born with all of as I said it's
[1:04:30] not born with these virtues it can't
[1:04:32] talk it can't do anything can't drive a
[1:04:34] car it can't do
[1:04:36] anything it's just a birth y right the
[1:04:39] only thing it can do is
[1:04:41] cry right well you know what that's true
[1:04:44] with you and I cuz the only thing we can
[1:04:46] do is cry out to God but he gave us the
[1:04:49] new
[1:04:50] birth that's
[1:04:52] right and it's the the earnest of our
[1:04:55] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[1:04:58] purchased possession that's right all
[1:05:01] right it's the foundation you got to
[1:05:03] have a foundation to put something on
[1:05:06] the church is built upon a revelation of
[1:05:08] Jesus Christ right Upon This Rock I'll
[1:05:11] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:05:13] shall not Prevail against it am so
[1:05:15] there's your new birth
[1:05:19] Faith so the prophet then what's he's
[1:05:21] describing how to get born again right
[1:05:24] have faith and be born again you cannot
[1:05:29] be you know you cannot be saved without
[1:05:33] having the new birth that's the
[1:05:36] Salvation amen right right see then you
[1:05:40] talk about
[1:05:41] adding that's right get to birth that's
[1:05:45] right and you'll see why brother randam
[1:05:47] spent so much on it I gave it over and
[1:05:49] over but was you listening yes he said I
[1:05:53] call my an alter call he said I want him
[1:05:56] to come up and be born again receive the
[1:05:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said just
[1:06:00] like it happened on the day of
[1:06:03] Pentecost but he said the people come up
[1:06:07] thinking well these are already saved
[1:06:09] they already this that and they want to
[1:06:11] get them to speak in
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:15] tongues right where they believe that
[1:06:18] they got the baptism he said no he said
[1:06:21] it's one and the same he said I give the
[1:06:24] altar call for you to come forth and be
[1:06:26] saved amen you say yeah but you spend
[1:06:28] all of this time explain right I explain
[1:06:30] what he
[1:06:31] said cuz he knew you didn't come to the
[1:06:34] Altar and get it all at one time he said
[1:06:37] that how many times did I quote that he
[1:06:39] said very few people will believe all
[1:06:41] the way to receive it the baptism of the
[1:06:44] holy spirit so he knew then and he would
[1:06:46] say okay you have repented of your sins
[1:06:49] that's justification now go on to
[1:06:52] sanctification and then go on to get
[1:06:54] Somebody Pray for you about the baptism
[1:06:56] you know why because he knew we didn't
[1:06:59] understand right cuz the best we' have
[1:07:02] done was trying to get somebody speak in
[1:07:06] tongues or tat already saved because
[1:07:09] they cried or believed or
[1:07:13] shouted see brother Brandon was having
[1:07:15] to face an age in a time when it was
[1:07:18] pitiful when he walked out
[1:07:20] there that's why it said that this
[1:07:22] Malachi 4 what he's going to restore the
[1:07:24] faith of the
[1:07:26] fathers the people had no faith of the
[1:07:29] fathers it didn't mean they didn't have
[1:07:30] a new birth but they didn't have any
[1:07:32] growth
[1:07:36] development they just shouted and cried
[1:07:39] and done everything and he tried his
[1:07:41] best to get people to believe it that's
[1:07:43] but they wouldn't believe
[1:07:46] it you know why they wouldn't believe it
[1:07:48] because the way they've been taught you
[1:07:50] know why people today can't believe
[1:07:52] because the way they've been taught
[1:07:54] well brother so and so says it's this
[1:07:59] way
[1:08:01] Hallelujah who's
[1:08:04] he but brother Dale or anybody else it
[1:08:06] don't make no difference to
[1:08:11] me
[1:08:13] y but you see I'm not
[1:08:15] talking my Ministry has never been
[1:08:18] talking to or trying to get people now
[1:08:20] listen
[1:08:21] please I try my best to get everybody in
[1:08:24] the world saved that I can right I
[1:08:26] preach for that but I know that the
[1:08:28] ministry I have doesn't deal with that
[1:08:31] type I'm not the one to get people to
[1:08:34] the altar to crying and praying out to
[1:08:36] God for salvation I'm the one that's
[1:08:39] trying to get those that have that to
[1:08:42] listen and grow
[1:08:44] development that's always been there
[1:08:47] well I can't help it but I do I believe
[1:08:49] still brother brandham like I said
[1:08:51] brother randam preached souls and pre
[1:08:54] prison and the altar filled with people
[1:08:57] to be
[1:09:00] saved I still believe the Holy Ghost can
[1:09:02] bring people in no matter which one of
[1:09:05] the Ministries he's
[1:09:07] using he can bring us in on it all right
[1:09:10] but see you must be born again and when
[1:09:12] you're born again you can't be born
[1:09:14] again without having
[1:09:15] faith right so there's your foundation
[1:09:19] Faith listen as we're going
[1:09:22] through go to number well the scripture
[1:09:26] go to the scripture and let's read it go
[1:09:28] to number three acts
[1:09:29] 238 listen what happened then Peter said
[1:09:33] unto them repent and be baptized every
[1:09:35] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:09:37] for the remission of sins and you shall
[1:09:40] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:42] listen amen for the promise is only just
[1:09:45] to a few people maybe one or two here
[1:09:47] somebody here might get that no no no it
[1:09:49] says is unto
[1:09:52] you y children amen and your children
[1:09:58] amen and to all that are far
[1:10:01] off
[1:10:03] Gentiles even as many as the Lord Our
[1:10:05] God shall call Jews Gentiles everything
[1:10:09] amen now that's the Bible That's Right
[1:10:11] amen then why would we want to think
[1:10:14] about the holy spirit being different in
[1:10:16] ages and
[1:10:19] things the new birth is a new
[1:10:22] birth
[1:10:26] but you see then like I said I'm not the
[1:10:29] ministry to to preach because if I was I
[1:10:31] would just try to make you feel good and
[1:10:33] get you to do it but my Ministry is to
[1:10:35] settle down and say all right hold on
[1:10:37] just a minute let's think this thing
[1:10:41] over am I all the way up to the pop of
[1:10:43] this pyramid or where am I
[1:10:46] at you had never thought about it you
[1:10:48] had never asked God where am I
[1:10:51] at you remember a sister I like her name
[1:10:54] was Shepherd Blasphemous
[1:10:58] names did she even had a dream about it
[1:11:01] and wondered where she was
[1:11:04] at the prophet took her dream and showed
[1:11:07] right where she was at he said God
[1:11:09] accepted her
[1:11:12] foundation than her
[1:11:16] faith that's in the dream it's in
[1:11:18] Blasphemous names if you listen to it
[1:11:20] you're supposed to heard
[1:11:21] it but look
[1:11:24] number four this is suning church age
[1:11:27] listen our church age book look what he
[1:11:29] says and in every age in every age is
[1:11:33] the age of the Holy Ghost for the True
[1:11:36] Believers I say in every age the
[1:11:39] evidence was the same those who heard
[1:11:42] the word took it and believed
[1:11:44] it right
[1:11:47] amen same holy ghost in every age that's
[1:11:50] right well I just don't believe we got
[1:11:52] it like they did in the book of Acts
[1:11:54] what do you
[1:11:55] mean why not just say you got it listen
[1:11:59] why don't you at least say I got it but
[1:12:02] it might not be like it is in the book
[1:12:03] of Acts no you're not saying that
[1:12:06] away you're saying I don't have it and
[1:12:09] you don't have
[1:12:11] it come on
[1:12:15] folks it's time to quit
[1:12:18] playing look at the next one which he's
[1:12:20] taken from Blasphemous names where you
[1:12:23] talking about the sister's dream but the
[1:12:25] five streams you see coming down through
[1:12:27] their tempers this together it has been
[1:12:30] the holy spirit that made the Ephesian
[1:12:33] church it was the Holy Spirit that
[1:12:36] birthed the saman church the holy spirit
[1:12:39] that gave the pergamus that gave the
[1:12:42] pergamus church the ti tyan Church in
[1:12:46] the Dark
[1:12:47] Ages come on it's the Holy Spirit that's
[1:12:51] built that bride the elect that that's
[1:12:53] pulled out of all the organizational
[1:12:56] organization system down Through the
[1:12:58] Ages like that am there's an elected a
[1:13:01] predestinated bride of Jesus Christ that
[1:13:04] the Holy Spirit has called out of out
[1:13:07] the elect and it's been the Holy Spirit
[1:13:09] watch him it's been the holy spirit in
[1:13:11] this age that age that age that that
[1:13:15] that that that on up to the top the holy
[1:13:20] spirit all right that should be enough
[1:13:23] right and now as in individuals these
[1:13:26] virtues and things are for you know
[1:13:28] knowledge and temp are added to your
[1:13:30] faith then when the Capstone comes which
[1:13:34] it hasn't come yet that's what your
[1:13:35] Prophet said the Holy Spirit cements it
[1:13:38] together there is the baptism of the
[1:13:40] Holy Spirit that's why it's so short
[1:13:42] today why why is it so short because you
[1:13:45] got people with a new birth you realize
[1:13:48] on the zeusa street they
[1:13:51] received the baptism of the Holy Holy
[1:13:53] Ghost just like the book of
[1:13:56] Acts the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on
[1:13:58] the zeusa
[1:13:59] street was the same holy spirit
[1:14:03] amen that fell back in the Bible time
[1:14:06] amen the Bible's wrong or your prophet's
[1:14:09] wrong if you don't believe it that way
[1:14:11] that's
[1:14:12] right I'm not trying to argue as what
[1:14:14] I'm saying I'm not trying to preach
[1:14:15] something to try to prove somebody wrong
[1:14:17] I'm trying to preach it to where you and
[1:14:19] I can have an opportunity to receive
[1:14:22] Christ and talk about it being the same
[1:14:24] let's take it to let's just talk about
[1:14:26] this him being the this holy spirit
[1:14:28] being the
[1:14:29] same at Pentecost go ahead let's start
[1:14:31] number
[1:14:34] six believest thou this Peter said on
[1:14:37] the day of Pentecost it's for you and
[1:14:39] for your children and for them that's
[1:14:40] far off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:14:43] shall call and every person that enters
[1:14:45] into the baptism of the spirit can have
[1:14:48] the same kind of holy ghost that they
[1:14:51] got on the day of Pentecost
[1:14:53] amen hallelujah he said I believe it's
[1:14:56] true not something that looked like
[1:14:59] it but the real
[1:15:02] thing same kind of holy ghost that fell
[1:15:05] back dire Falls now the same kind the
[1:15:09] real Holy Ghost brings forth the same
[1:15:11] kind of an Evidence and that they had
[1:15:13] back there comes with the same Holy
[1:15:15] Ghost you say but I just don't see
[1:15:18] that he said just the same holy spirit
[1:15:21] that fell back there on the day of
[1:15:23] Pentecost now he didn't have any trouble
[1:15:25] saying it why can't we that's right go
[1:15:27] to the number
[1:15:29] seven look what he
[1:15:31] says where I think Pentecost failed
[1:15:34] 55 the same Holy Spirit was upon Christ
[1:15:38] was his Manel that God gave him the
[1:15:42] anointing of the Holy Spirit now that
[1:15:44] was his Manel right the anointing of the
[1:15:46] Holy Spirit and they went up at
[1:15:49] Pentecost and waited in the upper room
[1:15:51] that when Jesus that when which was the
[1:15:53] antip of
[1:15:55] Elijah was taken up from death and
[1:15:58] resurrected he sent back the Manel the
[1:16:02] same holy spirit that was upon Him fell
[1:16:05] on the church right and he said the
[1:16:09] things that I do shall you do and
[1:16:11] greater thing a double portion of the
[1:16:14] same holy ghost that was upon Christ is
[1:16:17] upon the church and Elisha took that
[1:16:20] mantel and walked down to the river and
[1:16:22] struck him CU that's Elisha and Elijah
[1:16:24] right come on all right go to the next
[1:16:28] one which is oness pre 62 what is it you
[1:16:33] got to get with the word get yourself
[1:16:35] killed out now listen I love this one
[1:16:38] because it's true about me you and all
[1:16:39] of us but it's still the
[1:16:42] truth I'm persuaded that many of us
[1:16:45] friends have receive the Holy
[1:16:49] Ghost and but watch's our trouble but we
[1:16:54] just receive
[1:16:55] enough holy ghost in us to make us to a
[1:16:59] place where we don't want to lie we
[1:17:02] don't want to steal we want to don't
[1:17:04] want to do anything but God wants to
[1:17:06] fill every fiber of his church he wants
[1:17:09] to fill you your thinking he wants to
[1:17:11] fill your mind every bit of you he goes
[1:17:14] on to say completely totally dead see
[1:17:17] that's what's wrong with the church yeah
[1:17:19] what's wrong with the church they got to
[1:17:20] birth
[1:17:22] sir
[1:17:23] but ROM never denied Pentecostal people
[1:17:26] with a new birth that's right he said
[1:17:28] they had it just like the book of Acts
[1:17:30] that's right y but he says you need a
[1:17:32] growth development
[1:17:35] amen right adoptions and the things that
[1:17:38] goes with it
[1:17:39] amen we'll get to those things as we go
[1:17:41] along but the main thing is get to the
[1:17:43] birth amen are you truly Born Again
[1:17:48] amen just remember now we'll put this
[1:17:50] and settle
[1:17:52] it the holy spirit will act the same on
[1:17:55] every
[1:17:58] person that it's ever
[1:18:02] in
[1:18:04] right and you're going to act like on
[1:18:06] one person but not act like it on the
[1:18:08] other person now forget
[1:18:11] that so then what's been our wrong what
[1:18:14] was my point back
[1:18:16] there and when we talking about
[1:18:18] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:18:20] the Holy Ghost when I said here's a
[1:18:22] prophet says women overseas when they
[1:18:25] see Jesus Christ they fold their arms
[1:18:26] and walk out women here just get get
[1:18:28] more naked and
[1:18:31] naker amen but got they say they got the
[1:18:33] same Holy Ghost now there's something
[1:18:35] wrong right
[1:18:38] right the Holy Ghost only acts one
[1:18:42] way it's the same in every age and acts
[1:18:46] the same our trouble is what he said we
[1:18:48] get just enough Holy Ghost to quit lying
[1:18:52] and cheating
[1:18:53] okay well that's just
[1:18:56] no that's a
[1:18:58] birth the birth makes you a
[1:19:01] baby right the birth don't make you a
[1:19:04] stature of a perfect man that's what I'm
[1:19:06] trying to get at Peter's trying to tell
[1:19:08] you how to grow
[1:19:11] up trying to tell
[1:19:15] Lula tell you how to grow up me how to
[1:19:18] grow
[1:19:20] up right going to the next
[1:19:28] one all right that's the rejected
[1:19:31] King let's see wait a minute we're on
[1:19:35] number nine all right yeah the same Holy
[1:19:39] Spirit roll this up same holy ghost that
[1:19:43] fell on the day of
[1:19:44] Pentecost I want you which we all know
[1:19:47] that that that that was the birth of the
[1:19:49] new church and watch him if that same
[1:19:52] holy Holy Spirit don't bring the same
[1:19:54] experience to
[1:19:56] you then you got a different Holy Spirit
[1:20:00] now how many point how many do you need
[1:20:02] there's only one holy
[1:20:03] spirit so now what's he
[1:20:06] saying he's not saying you got a holy
[1:20:09] spirit that made you do this but we got
[1:20:11] a holy spirit that's genuine
[1:20:14] no he's saying you got something
[1:20:17] wrong
[1:20:19] right is that what he's saying if that
[1:20:23] holy spirit that don't don't bring the
[1:20:24] same experience then you got a different
[1:20:26] Holy Spirit than what that was exactly
[1:20:29] right if it don't make you live a
[1:20:31] sacrificial life and a life full of joy
[1:20:33] and pleasure and the baptism of the
[1:20:35] spirit leading you into signs and
[1:20:37] wonders and miracles and things there's
[1:20:39] something happened Jesus said these
[1:20:41] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:20:43] what's wrong with the church they're
[1:20:45] following their own ideas and opinions
[1:20:49] right instead of even believing what God
[1:20:51] Said right
[1:20:53] even to think about it go ahead to the
[1:20:55] next one we won't get all these R but at
[1:20:57] least you'll get enough this is taking
[1:20:59] off Redemption and completeness he says
[1:21:01] the same Holy Spirit fell then Falls now
[1:21:06] right and we go Plum on from that time
[1:21:11] to the end of
[1:21:13] time it'll go right on through it's our
[1:21:16] bread they were fed with the natural
[1:21:18] bread we are fed with the spiritual so
[1:21:21] then what fell back there has to keep
[1:21:22] going on them down okay go to the next
[1:21:24] one read fast if we can go to 12 11
[1:21:28] excuse
[1:21:30] me expect see well now the same holy
[1:21:34] spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost
[1:21:36] that's healed the sick back there it's
[1:21:39] been here in the church all the time yes
[1:21:44] okay but the thing of it is you don't
[1:21:47] know how to make it work for you amen
[1:21:50] now there's our problem we don't know
[1:21:53] how to make it work so we say it's not
[1:21:57] there Y and then we now watch it come on
[1:22:00] are we right then somebody does speak of
[1:22:04] God working in their
[1:22:06] lives anointed ones can do that
[1:22:12] too praise the Lord but what's the
[1:22:15] matter with
[1:22:17] you you mean anointed ones can do it and
[1:22:20] you claim the Holy Ghost and can't
[1:22:23] oh no brother Dale okay well all
[1:22:27] right come
[1:22:30] on time to put it on the line that's
[1:22:33] right right that's right then you start
[1:22:36] telling about things that happened in
[1:22:37] your life and people just draw
[1:22:40] up well it never happened to
[1:22:50] me I wish you would would I wish every
[1:22:54] one of you would write down at least one
[1:22:56] thing that's happened in your
[1:22:59] life one great experience has happened
[1:23:01] in your
[1:23:04] life and I'll come right here and I'll
[1:23:06] read every one of them for the glory of
[1:23:10] God because Church we're not out there
[1:23:12] playing with this silly stuff you don't
[1:23:14] have nothing I don't have nothing we
[1:23:15] just sit around waiting on the bus for
[1:23:17] up we've seen God raise the dead we've
[1:23:20] seen him heal all kind of sicknesses
[1:23:22] we've seen all kind of Miracles take
[1:23:24] place that's
[1:23:26] right that are not
[1:23:28] questioned
[1:23:32] right right but yet see I can tell say
[1:23:36] well the Lord changed my blood type from
[1:23:39] a negative to a I mean a positive to a
[1:23:42] negative well that was just a
[1:23:49] half
[1:23:51] well
[1:23:53] do you
[1:23:56] see why can't we believe what God has
[1:23:58] done with
[1:24:01] us Ryan would be glad to get up here and
[1:24:03] talk about his daughter wouldn't
[1:24:05] you Gabby would be glad to make a
[1:24:10] statement or two about their little
[1:24:11] daughter
[1:24:13] that is not supposed to be here
[1:24:19] today I still think he's Hebrews 13:8
[1:24:22] church I think what's wrong with us is
[1:24:24] we're not
[1:24:25] [Applause]
[1:24:27] believing watch
[1:24:29] him but the thing of it is you don't
[1:24:32] know how to make it work for you
[1:24:35] listen now there's the thing that makes
[1:24:37] it work is Faith to
[1:24:44] believe and when you believe and take
[1:24:47] him at his word that's a Lifeline it
[1:24:49] cannot fail go ahead to the next one
[1:24:55] amen Peter said on the day this is the
[1:24:58] inter Veil Peter said on the day of
[1:25:00] Pentecost Acts 2 he said for the
[1:25:02] promises unto you and to your children
[1:25:03] to them that are far off and as many as
[1:25:05] the Lord Our God shall call the same
[1:25:07] holy spirit that fell was forever
[1:25:10] generation even to the Gentiles I I love
[1:25:14] that those that were always considered
[1:25:17] far off even as the many and then listen
[1:25:21] roll this up now
[1:25:22] as long as God's still calling God's
[1:25:25] still giving the Holy
[1:25:30] Spirit But but so and so said it was
[1:25:32] this way
[1:25:34] okay and then may I ask the question are
[1:25:37] we going to believe so and so are we
[1:25:38] going to believe the
[1:25:39] Bible which one are we going to
[1:25:42] believe all right look at the next
[1:25:45] one I love this part listen this is the
[1:25:48] hidden
[1:25:49] life he's talking about get kind of make
[1:25:51] up you know emotion or mental makeup uh
[1:25:54] we don't have to take something the
[1:25:56] devil would hand down listen but every
[1:25:59] believer that comes from the altar to
[1:26:01] the consecrated life to the baptism of
[1:26:04] the Holy Ghost can get not only a
[1:26:09] mouthful listen but a soul full of the
[1:26:13] original baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:26:16] fell on the day of
[1:26:21] Pentecost

[1:26:59] happened down through time you order to
[1:27:00] see it today now someday these men will
[1:27:04] die now watch him he's talking about the
[1:27:07] ungodly
[1:27:08] spirit and if there's another generation

[1:29:43] accounts of the Holy Spirit taken doing
[1:29:46] that cuz this one's taking off the
[1:29:48] handwriting on the wall and he says the

[1:30:06] message the other night if there would
[1:30:09] happen to be one be be one stranger we
[1:30:13] had the most thrilling thing that I have
[1:30:15] heard in many years of the personal
[1:30:17] coming down of the Holy Spirit just like
[1:30:19] it did in the Bible right here the noise
[1:30:21] like a Thunder roaring coming out of the
[1:30:23] heavens and the spirit of the Lord
[1:30:25] coming through the building like an
[1:30:26] unseen wind that was shaking and taken
[1:30:30] it the people as he went through many of
[1:30:33] them in here are still Witnesses how
[1:30:36] many is here to Witnesses just exactly
[1:30:39] the way it did on the day of
[1:30:41] Pentecost
[1:30:43] okay listen
[1:30:45] list okay yeah and just praying while in
[1:30:49] prayer no emotions and watch
[1:30:54] and just praying while in prayer no
[1:30:56] emotions no running like they did at the
[1:30:59] day penos see not they wasn't running
[1:31:01] around they sitting there but the same
[1:31:03] Holy Spirit come in as a rushing Mighty
[1:31:06] Wind with a roar that I thought first
[1:31:08] when it was coming that it was an
[1:31:10] airplane watch him now that had swept
[1:31:13] down into the building and Doctor Lee
[1:31:16] Vale here thought it was a sounded like
[1:31:19] the reversing of the Wind in a
[1:31:23] pipe uh
[1:31:25] organ now watch him and he looked around
[1:31:28] to the organ and it's an electric organ
[1:31:31] he thought it was the sound in the you
[1:31:33] know thing then he heard it was coming
[1:31:36] from
[1:31:37] above and went right down come down here
[1:31:39] and around to the pull pit no what it
[1:31:42] was a glorious
[1:31:43] experience okay now if I can find the
[1:31:50] other
[1:31:53] okay that's all right there was another
[1:31:54] experience he was talking about in a
[1:31:55] line and he says did you feel it said
[1:31:58] there is the same holy
[1:32:00] spirit so why wouldn't we want to
[1:32:02] believe that it's the same Holy Spirit
[1:32:04] had always been
[1:32:06] here why wouldn't we want to believe
[1:32:08] it's been in every age and been forever
[1:32:11] believer that would ever believe it
[1:32:14] because if we don't believe it we can't
[1:32:15] have the new
[1:32:17] birth if we don't have the new birth
[1:32:19] like on the day of Pentecost then we
[1:32:20] can't start up the stature of a perfect
[1:32:23] man there's the trouble people don't
[1:32:26] believe it come on you there's the
[1:32:28] trouble that's what I was reading the
[1:32:29] trouble is what the people don't believe
[1:32:33] the same holy spirit that was on the day
[1:32:35] of Pentecost is the same Holy Spirit
[1:32:37] that's here right now to save
[1:32:40] you so thereby God can't bring it to
[1:32:43] pass and watch even those am I quoting
[1:32:47] him we get just enough Holy Ghost to
[1:32:50] stop this that even even those who have
[1:32:53] the same Holy
[1:32:56] Spirit doubt the presence of God being
[1:32:59] it real and and it being like it was in
[1:33:02] the book of
[1:33:04] Acts why why would we not believe
[1:33:09] it yeah but I just don't see the signs
[1:33:11] and
[1:33:12] wonders there will never be to the
[1:33:14] Gentile dispensation another Prophet The
[1:33:18] Prophet is com and gone he had the signs
[1:33:20] the resurrection and all of the things
[1:33:22] it's not promised for us to do those
[1:33:24] things but I do love what the prophet
[1:33:26] said after the door this Gentile church
[1:33:28] is go God will anoint a church and he
[1:33:30] will do in one year what theologist
[1:33:32] tried to do in 2000 but said he's doing
[1:33:34] it now that's all of questions and
[1:33:37] answers brother around and said there'll
[1:33:39] be such a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:41] that'll come one day that it'll fill
[1:33:42] every fiber of our being and take us
[1:33:44] into Rapture
[1:33:46] amen right amen when are we going to
[1:33:48] believe God is here see if we don't
[1:33:50] believe he's here he can't
[1:33:52] work oh yeah but he no no come on don't
[1:33:55] let's don't get out of the Bible with
[1:33:57] our own theology Jesus could not heal in
[1:34:01] certain places he had to take the person
[1:34:03] outside or either turn out everybody to
[1:34:06] get them out of there why and the Bible
[1:34:09] said he couldn't do no great miracles in
[1:34:11] one city he said because of their
[1:34:13] unbelief that's right you believe it was
[1:34:15] almighty God don't you well then if he
[1:34:17] was almighty God why couldn't he
[1:34:20] work
[1:34:23] because that
[1:34:26] unbelief what do you think brother brand
[1:34:28] would be standing there trying to
[1:34:29] explain to the people about the baptism
[1:34:32] of the Holy
[1:34:33] Ghost and seeing that unbelief it was
[1:34:36] setting out in front of him as dark
[1:34:38] objects and things hooded things over
[1:34:40] people's eyes and
[1:34:43] face and he Begg God he said I laid
[1:34:46] before God now this is a quote he said I
[1:34:48] laid before
[1:34:50] God to get this gift to
[1:34:56] work he would lay before God and then
[1:34:58] beg God to come and work that gift in
[1:35:02] the church that they could see
[1:35:06] Christ
[1:35:09] right because of their unbelief they
[1:35:11] couldn't follow it so look at it now
[1:35:13] what's happening around the message
[1:35:15] people of what they're
[1:35:17] doing they're turning against him
[1:35:19] calling him a false prophet they calling
[1:35:21] him everything in the
[1:35:23] book I like what the brother said said
[1:35:26] well that's a false prophet praise the
[1:35:28] lord we found out one thing God has
[1:35:30] prophets false or true so if he's got a
[1:35:32] false he got to be true that's right so
[1:35:35] praise the Lord there's got to be a true
[1:35:36] one
[1:35:38] somewhere
[1:35:40] right so we believe God has sent us a
[1:35:43] prophet the Holy Ghost to direct us all
[1:35:46] the way through that's it developed into
[1:35:48] a man and the great signs and wonders
[1:35:52] but we're not left empty-handed and this
[1:35:54] is what I wrote on my desk and left you
[1:35:56] mean to tell
[1:35:58] me that we think that we're at the end
[1:36:01] of the
[1:36:04] world
[1:36:05] right we believe we're at the end of the
[1:36:08] world we're not making dates and times
[1:36:10] and Seasons right but we believe at the
[1:36:12] end of the world right we believe the
[1:36:14] end of all things has come upon us and
[1:36:16] you mean to tell me that God is not here
[1:36:18] the way he was
[1:36:20] there
[1:36:24] we'll go back through the message and
[1:36:25] show where it gets greater and greater
[1:36:26] and greater
[1:36:28] right what was back there brother
[1:36:32] Brandon my God I had them there had to
[1:36:33] bypass them he said the same holy ghost
[1:36:35] that fell back there he said fa here
[1:36:38] Falls
[1:36:40] here and see we think that that Holy
[1:36:42] Spirit is not here for that you mean to
[1:36:44] tell me God is ending this thing up and
[1:36:46] going to take somebody in a Rapture when
[1:36:47] there's not going to be a God moving
[1:36:49] Among
[1:36:50] Us
[1:36:52] it's like I told you though you know
[1:36:54] what the problem is people say I don't
[1:36:57] have it you don't have it but when I get
[1:36:59] it I'll tell you how to get
[1:37:07] it every Doctrine there is you want to
[1:37:10] stand up four hours and talk about them
[1:37:12] every doctrine that there is in this
[1:37:13] message has got a man standing in front
[1:37:15] of
[1:37:18] it to tell you that when I tell you when
[1:37:21] it's
[1:37:22] here oh but they don't say that come on
[1:37:25] be sensible and
[1:37:31] listen think about it let's stand what
[1:37:34] do we got number 257 see I believe the
[1:37:37] Holy Spirit has always been the same I
