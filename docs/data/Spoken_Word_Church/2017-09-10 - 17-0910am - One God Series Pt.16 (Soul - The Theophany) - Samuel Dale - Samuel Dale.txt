just bust it up and send it away let it not be Wentworth it would just call it any of the damages and things that they're afraid of Lord just take care of everybody and bless and guide each one in Jesus name Amen John one and then we're going to Genesis in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was a lot of men and the light shining in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was no way the darkness can it can't do anything to light it doesn't matter how dark it gets he can't put the light out there's no way it doesn't matter how dark it keeps getting all right let's go to Genesis 1:26 and 27 where we've been reading some and just and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them now let's continue on and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea you know follow the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now I'm going to quote a lot and we're not gonna pull it up on the screen because we've done it so much but I'll be quoting for a while till we get on over good piece into the message and then we will start to read some you know alright now what have we been talking about I'm trying to I tried to get this to an end last Sunday but it didn't ever work so you know I was really intending to just come out last Sunday and say wait I'm gonna take the evening service and finish up what I've got well I decided no no I won't do that well as quick as he started the service and started ministering I saw why I didn't say that so I said okay I'll just do it next Monday you know he wouldn't take care of it the coast there's more added to the story than just the thoughts of what we're doing and you're getting bored maybe by me going over and over the point of trying to follow before the foundation of the world and coming into reality but I thought the Prophet said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here well who is she you know not that it's not that mankind down through time through the church ages has not understood that they were the children of God it's like I said to you in one of the services when wisdom Baptist Church we talked about we read the Bible we read the parables and we talk about being the children of God right Presbyterian donut Baptist Methodist whatever we all had that in the thoughts well that was great but it's truth but then you go to them and you say well okay now we're the children of God and that's okay we're the children of God so come on down to where we are and you come to the message people you know that they're supposed to know the truth and you say where the children got a man we're the children of God and then you talk to them a little bit and you'll see them they'll go back with you far enough to reach maybe thoughts of predestination I'm talking about over in the message people and even moving to the points of talking about you know foreknowledge and how that God foreknew you well we could do those things in in the Baptist Church we had thoughts on that line you know because we talked about it all right but we know now here's my point my point is we know comparing what we see now to what we saw in the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian etc then it's went into a deeper understanding unfolding more of truth alright and as we understand and unfold more the truth the further we can go backward right are you following me well see then we move into the message realm and we're into the deeper understanding of that and we look back and say well you know we believe that then but oh look what we see now look at the opening of God's Word now scriptures we used to wonder why it said this and why it said that you know and say you know like scripture says now we are the sons of God well you know well didn't I remember back DNA to argue backwards and forth about that understanding you know and it wouldn't open up all right but then you know you come into the message realm and you begin to get a better understanding of the scriptures and more unfolds to us by way of the message of the hour all right and we look back and say well not look that was fine but look what we see now compared to that and are you are you with me I'm trying to get a thought to you you you think about where you're sitting today and where you was when you were in the denominations or something prior to where you are it's not nothing new right we talked about those things all right let's see it's more plainer clearer more of understanding coming into our our parts that we understand and we're beginning to see who we are the other wanted to prophet say when the bride realized who she is and what she's here for what are we here for we're here to conquer Satan and that these bodies are to be changed we're not here to just bring redemption into the viewing of the new birth that was down through time and that's been through that and all of that is well and good but we're here to bringing it to the final which would be the redemption of the body you know all right and to do that we say well what all we need to do is just read this that or the other no it's got to be revealed all right so then do you understand what I'm getting at so we come up into the message and we begin to understand predestination as we never understood it before then we begin to talk about foreknowledge you know all right and then we begin to say you know well foreknowledge comes before predestination because those who he for know he did predestinate all right now we're getting a clearer understanding and what I'm trying to drive that that means that if you're getting a clear understanding it means you're able to go back further and don't worry about going that away now all right and I told you a long time ago I said I'm not interesting going heaven I said I'm interested in heaven coming here and I thought heavenly places was where we started from all right now see then to see the point then it's unfolding and as it unfolds we can go back feather in two as we call it the mind of God the things and the realities of the Scriptures and where the morning stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy and where Jesus said he knew us before the foundation of the world and talking to the disciples and everything the scripture said we were chosen in him those things should be unfailing a better look at what's taking place or what took place in your new birth and bringing you up to it by the message of the hour all right and see then it means that we wear that will keep going back father I hope you understand that point oh no I want to go that way we'll remember eternity goes just as far that way as it goes that away all right so I'm not interested in that because all of that's got to come here now you're chained to the body's not going to take place up in heaven just as the natural point right all right so then we're going back into the mind of God to see the realities of understanding you know I've listened twice to last Sunday service and I wish you would listen to that service if you don't have a computer whatever I wish you would get Richard then we'll make you a copy on the CDs or whatever needed do where you can can go back and and listen to that I wish you would you know I kind of enjoyed it myself okay because see what I do listen sure what I do is not set during think Boyd great now man I laid that on that time I was doing real good that's stupidity no I'm thinking Lord look where you brought us from and where we are now well I just don't see very much I'm just you don't well okay we'll get away from that but listen she didn't in thinking I asked the questions where were we and who were we before the foundation world I was last Sunday's thought in relation who were we and where were we all right and then I asked you to do that with one thing in mind can you find the soul of God in the Old Testament you remember that ask it over and over you don't try to find the body because the body or literal corporal we understand that it wasn't back there even Melchizedek's and etc the times it was met was a body spoken into existence spoken out of existence that body could not die for you that could not that was not your brother because it was not brought through the wound of the humanity to be able to bring it to being our kin folks all right and I asked you I said can you I said you can see you know don't need to worry about the body I said but you see the Spirit of God back there as it would anoint those prophets and the great things that would take place under them and their their messages for the day and you can follow that spirit and you can keep following that spirit as you come into the New Testament because as it comes into the New Testament we talk about anointed ones of how that you can be anointed on your spirit and still be lost with the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit upon your spirit now there was a time that was a mass confusion right but it's beginning to unfold I hope nowhere we can understand well but I ask you that the end of the message could you find the soul of God that guy remember the soul is the nature of the Spirit right now so then we can look back there and see not only at the time that that anointing could be on Moses and and beyond all those great prophets that we could follow and I hope you listen to the end of it that we could follow then to see the nature of God as it unfolded through the Old Testament how that it was judgment to David that even he called his own you know when they was told about the sheep and they you know that I'm in all true that had happened through what was his name Uriah is that his name you know and he said bring him here I'll kill it and automatically the prophet what did he say he didn't say David now you're too good of a guy for God to kill so now I've talked this over with the Lord and we decided to leave you here now that wasn't exactly what happened what did the Prophet immediately say he didn't say David we'll work out something God will forgive you not as quick as it was said from David I'll kill him myself he didn't explain to David that David was the bad guy he said David you won't die I prayed for you right there's the nature of God where is the nature of God in the beginning when sin entered the picture the nature of God came into being - in some form you want to call it and we talked about it being the soul of God and the theophany you realize God pull the skin off of those animals that's pretty strong ended when he pull that skin off those animals and wrapped Adam and Eva there's a nature of God when you see everything was ready to be destroyed but God would move on the scene the Bible said it was ten times that they taught they trouble God from the time they left Egypt to Katy's Barnea said ten times ten times has done it every time they were still headed to the promised land now watch them when they sealed her own sail and they went the wrong way at Cadiz Barnea and we're not able to go into the land but you know what a lot of them still went into the life you understand what I'm getting at can you find and the nature of God with the three Hebrew children and the fiery furnace and the fourth man can you find that nature of God as he takes care of the people of children of Israel and I remember that statement when I first heard it letter Brown said God didn't step in heaven when man sinned he said he come down to live with man upon earth what even in the sinful parts it was an atom hunting for God it was God searching for Adam see that way you can find the soul of God the very nature of God his very being whose back tire our Hebrews 13:8 is messed up do you understand Hebrews 13:8 said it's the same yesterday today and forever now there was no way to transmit that life that soul could do all of those things but it could not be transmitted into mankind even though the spirit could anoint great things but yet it had to wait until that nature that being that sold that person came into being which was the Lord Jesus Christ then he could give his life in what the body would go to the grave the spirit would go back to God who gave it but to soul then would go down and witness to those people in the long suffer in the days of Noah come right back up my paradise is this call and pick up what the souls of those people what we're in that this their what no body in it their body was in the grave spirit went back to God who gave it it was the soul of those people in paradise he could pick them up bring them up into the earth and in the great things right alright so then can you follow the soul of God through the nature of how he displays himself and look was not Jesus the very nature of Almighty God is that true he was forgiving in ever form right he was forgiving in ever form of life that could beat him that could do everything - right that was the very nature of God not just an anointing of the Spirit but the very nature the very person of Almighty God all right see then that's where we found what we were talking about how that back before the world ever begun brother Branham on that I'm just going to quote and run across from God who is rich in mercy some part of you was back tyre you were one of his attributes some part of you was back there what part of you in back there not your body not your spirit the soul of the individual is what we're dealing with souls in prison brother Brown said if he can get that soul just to stand steal he said didn't nature he said it'll die what the very soul of Almighty God dwelling in a man because he was body spirit and soul Almighty God sees into your father and what I'm talking about we found the only way that we could be back before the foundation or was to be a part of God see then that is not just for knowledge that is not just in the mind of God as I said to you for 40 years I don't want to think about just being in the mind of God because Judas was dark all the sin is there I was listening we was like not to message and brother Brian said everybody in the world was saved when Jesus died at Calvary what's wrong they won't have it he said they won't accept it whatever body was saved when the book of life was written there is two sections what you got the book of life which it can contain a lot of different names Judas in him but then you got the book of the life of the Lamb there were slain and those are only the ones with eternal life those are their children our offspring of Almighty God he said yeah but you're getting too close you talk about a soul and said you've hollered at us for all the years to get us away from the Mormon doctrine of pre existence of souls I know that doctrine I've talked with the people they don't believe you're so they believe in actual people being there finds you want to talk to it they believe in literal people or something being that no I've never said a word about literal people I've drove it hard the only way you and I was there was back there in God if you have eternal life this day that eternal life was in God before the world ever begun our you'll never have eternal life all right see them to see they were not talking about souls running all over the place over heaven and then we decide to do this you're talking about one soul because he ain't divided yet I know about back on him you talk about one show there's only one eternal life right there's only one eternal theophany there's only one soul that's eternal and that is the soul of God all right if we can see that we was back dire in him we gave the quote from the Prophet how that we were in him and by being in him we had to be part of him just as your children a part of you then we had to come forth and be displayed on earth sin had to enter the picture we'll get to those things you stay with me were mad and see by being that brother brother said some part of you some part of me he said was dire when God created man he said some part of me william branham he said was back there in which he went on to say in that same paragraph what some part of me armand neville some part of our Mandel and said some part of you was back there what was it well it's just a spirit floating right well then we're just spirits floating right remember if he was the word with the often II is a word body we'll get to that we haven't done that and don't worry about it we're brother run said we might by Stan we'll get to that and cover it because that's no problem we just never come that away Jesus came that away and created the world but we had to be in him when he was created in the world go who is in him when he walked on the shores of Galilee in what now you can see it's not a bunch of souls little spots little things over here these people make that drawing and it was people looking oh yes that's so wonderful I can see it now we was little spots I'm sorry I go back too far too old and whenever you remember in the first grade school run spot run see spot run he said what are you saying I'm saying that silly the thing with little spots no before the world we were not there as souls of us we were there in him see little random own leaning not to your own understand he said God isn't complete without you he said on Christ is revealed in his own word he said do we were dire in germ form germ form is what a germ is not a seed a germ is a life prior to a stage called seed right the germ of life he's died before the husk and everything comes on then what we call seed brother brother said on modern events make honesty in modern events he said we were a soul of God he said own broken cistern we were souls a part of God we were in him demonology physical realm he said our souls were made up before the foundation of the world ezekiel 18:4 sit all souls are mine but remember there wasn't anything back before the foundation world with Almighty God I thought I'm driving to us to see anything that I'm saying that was back there's got to be in God not us with God you said well we've got one now see I swear you Trinitarians when he's Trinitarian to John 1 in the beginning was the word Word was with God but they don't read the rest in the word was called see we were with God in the beginning as being a part of God if we have eternal life if we don't we're not a part of him that should be enough to settle it right look on the faith of Abraham he said you begin with a soul and he said that's when God created man 1 26 and 27 of Genesis he didn't create man over in the sixth day or that man as a spiritual being was created before the world ever begun or as a part of God not people's identities a part of God you must be born again he said what is a soul he said you are a soul Jesus died when Jesus died it was a soul that died now come on we've been through it so don't run your mind off and the people out there brother Brennan said God never died in spirit and see God never died in soul he acted the part of death he stepped out of that body and went down to hell to witness to those people and to come back up through paradise he never died it's just a statement it's a way of saying things when Jesus died it was the soul of God when do no good with the spirit part of it and you just enormous we knew all kind of things now come on to keep the message running right remember that soul is the nature of the spirit when I remember what I always expressed because I feel led to do that part you know yourself that in brother Browns early ministry he basically I said basically coat is not over time basically he told body so spirit he sought the soul as the second dream the spirit is the center but then when it opened unto him and he came on father I'm quoting from the message and North it not but around said its body spirit and soul as God as a trying being and that's what you are you're a body spirit and soul see there's word that Hebrews comes into being that the Bible said in Hebrews what is it Hebrews 12 or 14 at which 4:12 where he's talking about the the things that are made manifest and clear to us even the body spirit and soul it's clear to us by the opening of the word that's what it's saying me brother Branham did not have to explain because nobody else understood what was going on anyway that's the best way to say it and solve the whole problem alright but what happened when Jesus went to hell it was his soul that went to hell it was him in theophany because his soul is it was its theophany little random own questions and answers he said he sold his theophany was in paradise now remember there's two parts of that because he worth went to hell he didn't bring none of them out that was those that were disobedient long-suffering but then he came over to those in the in the paradise it was called and he took out but remember he didn't take all of them out you say well I've got a quote were part of I've got a quote - the Bible says all the Old Testament Saints never raised he said well how's that don't know I don't know and he's not what the scripture says right all right little Brennan said on entombment his whole soul his spirit his theophany of his being went to hell to preach and see that's what it was waiting that body was laying in the grave that spirit had went back to God who gave it the soul was in paradise and all doing all of those things cuz that was his being and he says who is that soul he said Abraham saw that soul that theophany that being of that person and fed him a cave you remember what we talked about he said Moses stood and looked the other way in other words in the cleft of the rock and God went by and he said he saw the back part little run said that was the back part of Jesus Christ well because that was his theophany that was his soul you know but I don't see a soul is being real why not is your spirit more real than your soul is your body more real than the spirit in the soul why don't you see that but see the problem is we're not going to lay down our thinking see if we've sung songs we've preached about I got a theophany up in the heavens waiting on me your prophet says your soul is youth the often and he said even a sinner had a theophany because that means a body to go to when he was in hell those people that were in hell were there in bodies not human flex bodies their soul was there we were going to lay down our thinking except what's said by the Prophet when he says your soul is your theophany this page 80 of the whole of the Hebrew book you wanted o natus I'll get it in a minute it's 2 to 78 or 478 or something paragraph they say old age ad in the Hebrew book see his soul was his theophany or the body that he was in which was not a natural body but it was his being new and he says on the message who is this Melchizedek said there he was turned back in to that theophany see that's what happened that the often Easter so the soul it was a did not Jesus say into thy hands I commend my soul he said what's old in spirit soul experience an interchangeable word that's why I said even mankind never knew those things so then spirit is totally interchangeable when you're trying to define which one is which and as I said Sunday you take this the spirit the word spirit this means your spirit or this spirit or a spirit coming it means the devil in the spirit it doesn't define the difference you've got to define whether it's speaking of God are speaking of you see because the truth is the truth so let's start from their own net and let me let me just get to that point I told them we we jumped a number or number 818 if you think I don't have a lot of it I go over to 44 so you do what you want to and get him up here going that far so let's look at what he's saying from the message who is this Melchizedek which would be number 19 well they believe 18 leave 18 let's get here okay that's from the adoption Paul says he does not appear welcome but you know but we know that we'll have a body like his well did he ever have that theophany body yes sir when he died the Bible said he is a personal pronoun uh again personal pronoun again he went to hell and preached to the souls in prison hallelujah he preached to the souls that were in hell that repented not in the long suffering the days of Noah then he rose up with the Old Testament Saints coming up and he's bringing them up look 72 hours he was up said that theophany that body that went and preached to the souls that were in prison they repented not the long-suffering in the days of Noah he was there in his soul his theophany he said well what is the theophany a theophany is a word body lettering said not like it is in the glorified state but who's it going to look like you can make light oh you won't to anybody out darting to say what I'll tell you want that brother Dale please it that I believe what the Prophet said he said Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 was the closest to God that there was of Jesus that he saw well you know what I'm not gonna go look for a bunch of other people to look like because I don't know the the point that he said it's the closest well why can't we believe it you said what is your guard look like Jesus Christ was my god is that your God and he looked like Hoffman's and even brother branham that defines it because the other one looked very close its Brahm or something like that or brown that's very close to similarities he said I don't like that one you know he saw what he saw when are we going to believe it alright let's go to 19 then what started just a little bit I'm trying to finish this where do you think it or not but it just keeps piling up so okay alright forgive me then when a man is born again from heaven he becomes a spirit babe in Christ because you see it don't matter what you think about what you were back there when we get that straightened out and if I you still got to be born again that eternal life has got to come into you that's a lot of the story yet right what and then when this robe of flesh is dropped there is a natural body theophany a body not made with hands neither born of woman that we go to that's fine the sinner has a place he has to go to which is his soul it's the off me we got a place to go to when we die then what then when this rover Fletcher dropped there's a natural body theophany a body not made with hands neither born of woman that would go to then that body returns back and picks up the glorified body okay that's the reason Jesus went to hell when he died and preached to the souls that were in prison turned back into that theophany Oh marvelous thank God turn back into that theophany so his soul was this theophan and like I said then if you'll get it straight and think about it you'll see that nature of God through that soul of God as it comes through the Old Testament coming right down he just didn't wait until coming go maybe I quote brother branham if I miss quoted I believe it's right this way didn't he say he said if you if you don't see Christ in every verse go back and read it again see not Jesus because Jesus the flesh wasn't back there Jesus the flesh was not the one that tore the skins off the animals with Jesus the God who has done it he clothed him with skin those nerves were no good now come on get your story right you know what brother Ron said about Adam and Eve he said there's over in the bushes having church right with their fig leaves God ripped off him skins and told him in there and said here put these on now come on out he said blood splattering all over him as they were leaving the garden blood splattering down their legs he said right tires were God wrung out and said we're hold it I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman you won't die there's the soul of God not just the spirit to anoint I'm trying to get you to see the real God he said well God is just a spirit then he could know anybody and they saved but you got to receive the very person of Jesus Christ into your soul to have eternal life come on okay go ahead question as an answered on Hebrews number twenty God in the beginning when he knowed that man and woman was made one not two now follow it you remember Sunday I kept emphasizing Adam and Eve you've got to read what your prophet said you got to believe they were one in theophany cuz we'll read that in just a minute if you can see that there's not the one of the often e eternal the other one is going the other way brethren said one goes up one goes down see then you can see there's just one eternal life now that's the question run around the house he said is a to eternal life he's a noted on the one eternal man who always made one not two they were one made one they were separated one put in flesh one of the theophany now what kind of a man did God make first spirit man right what spirit man spirit man control the garden and I who was it theophany so Adam walked in the garden and led the animals inside before he ever walked are in humans legs come on right so in order to prove that when God made the woman he never took some dust and made her like he did the man he took a rib out of the side of Adam and she become a bright product of a man that's what I asked you you don't even go do it go look of my product we want to make it some dirty something remember God made it did he make Eve wrong he can't judge if he made it wrong my product means of equal value are great or older that don't fit in my mind I've always my mama said my brother my uncle Cedric and I say brother I don't even like the jokes of the people of this message I'm serious the people of this message get up in the pulpit and said see there then women or byproducts anywhere they can that's close to blaspheming believe what you want to you know it said and done they make the woman something but the Prophet they never preach that Eve was not taken from another he sees a byproduct the way they made it she would have had to been took from another piece of dirt she was not she was taken from a rib of Adam she was in Adam Adam and Eve were one look one foot in flesh when it's the off knee he says she's part of him huh go ahead what do we got number all right let's go to this one number 21 is take a little question and answer it on Hebrews he's coming down and he no man to till the soil God put him in flesh so he could tell us oh I'll give him five senses Matilda so on fix it up the vineyards as I the man still looked lonesome Eve was in Adam at that time in the rewrite but she was not in Adam at that time in theophany you're gonna read it Adam had done come into flesh do you look long from when he come into flesh Eve was inside of him that's great but just remember that theophany was not there aviv and remember Adam and Eve had only one theophany we're gonna read that so you can do what you want to look for when he was first made he was made two people together he was both made both male and female the man was the Bible said he was God made both male and female created he him notice now when man was separated from the theophany and put in the flesh he was he wasn't just all together dark part of his being was still a theophany so it didn't look like he had him standing in human flesh on their Eve's inside of him called hurry up would he still lonely because they couldn't couldn't fellowship come on I went to male and female in the cow there went the horse that I went to hogs and there went everything else person but Adam he it was there was something lacking that very crave showed that there was a mate waiting for him you get it in the very thoughts that we have to die here and join us shows us I'm waiting for us alright Adam was lonesome and God to show that they could not be separated now I'm going to get back into this same thing just a second look he never went and got dirt and made a Eve but he made from the original dirt Adam he took a real from his side and made him a help me that was easy she was made for the mahan and part of the man and the read she was part of him in the beginning in the creation in the theophany she was part of him down here in this creation she could not be divided in another creation she had to be made in the same creation he had to be the creator himself but he still does theophany come on she was part of him go ahead in number 22 we had number 22 take on the Hebrews chapter 2 he done made male and female there's no man to till the soil and we just read it he was part of him in theophany right now what's he talking about there's no man to till the soil but he's already my own female read but we don't like we got it figured out brother so Angela said it's okay if I'm not my brother so don't forget what you're doing I'm trying to get nothing I'm trying to dis preach the truth and he's a quoting here over at around said I'm not trying to priests doctor and he said I'm trying to straighten it out listen there was no man coach when when when man become into that body what body theophany spiritual body the one 26 and 27 he had control of the fishes and the fowls and beasts of the field and the ner was no man to till the soul Genesis 2 he done made male and female there's no man that tilde someone then God made man out of the dust of there he gave him a hand like this and the dust of the earth rolled it up makes him look like this the entity made up cows in petroleum but the difference between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany now much plainer could we get your soul is your theophany yeah but I've always believed I had one up younger we'll get to it in a minute I got over here on doubt getting today but the Bible said if this earthly tabernacle work that's two questions there's all we have one waiting it ain't turnin till you die is that sensible you're regardless of how you want to make this or make that it ain't there till you die no it's up younger go ahead number 23 Nagaland questions and answers on Hebrews what do we do well my dear st. brother my dear sainted sister before the foundation of the world now read this and listen and you'll see the 126 man was one person 1 so one theophany what the hell is that I thought we all I thought everybody in here that had eternal life had the life of Christ is that true so then there's only one eternal theophany before the foundation of the world when God created you in His image are created the man in His image and create the woman in the image of the man for the glory of the man he made you at the orphan II just like himself when he said led us to the creatures that he had made let us make man in our own image in her own likeness what's the Alpha nee God had never become flesh yet he was in a theophany and Moses saw him Moses cried the Lord let me see or D see him in a theophany yes all right get it into a little body of flesh breathe into it stepped into it come down that's when he was a pure and Abraham when his appearing to Moses God just spoke a body in this and stepped into it and come on here all right what's the next one adoption what is that one of 24 from adoption he does not yet appear what kind of body will help but we know that we'll have a body like is that scripture always bothered me until this series the scripture says we're gonna have a body like his but we all gonna look like him ain't talking about a flesh come on well we know we'll have a body like he had what did he ever have that theophany yes sir when he died the Bible said he is a personal pronoun he went to hell and preached to the souls in prison hallelujah how did he do it he had sensitive feeling there was one thing brought around let her straighten out with me on that could I even had him I had it in the beginning that's your soul your theophany had no feeling to it brother Brown says a higher feeling a greater feeling those beyond the curtain of time was in their soul right and he could hug them right and feel them ride in them endure theophany not in their physical body now it wasn't his physical body his physical body he said we lay it on the bed come on Alleluia how to do it he had sensitive feeling and since they're here yet sensitive preach he preached with that same kind of a body I saw those glorified ones in the other night what was Jesus when he went to hell to preach to the same body or kind of body and I saw those glorified ones he preached the soldier when hail they repented not in the long-suffering the days of Noah with any rose on Easter and all those things and not leave this old in hell I love that scripture neither would I sell from my Holy One see corruption 72 hours now just as a repeat did you catch it that's the irony that body that when to preach to the souls that were in prison they repented not in the long-suffering what is your soul yet the off in it what about it number 25 questions unanswered on Hebrews now there you are that's the way we are we come from a higher being in the beginning we were in the image of God the veil in the darkness keeps us from knowing it now but Jesus told his disciples he was with them before the foundation of the world see we were you can't know it now which you was in the beginning and if this earthly time we're not going to be dissolved we have one already waiting inverted L it's already waiting is it dark before we die you've got to get to Pais in the way of the body is it her some time now we have one already waiting and Olivia then we move into this theophany well we want to live so we can eat and shake hands sold under the altar how long si and run around priests that feel seal and use the scriptures of how long how long to avenge our blood our minds automatically lock that you can't use how long how long because we're not sinners we don't say that sold under the altar how long 57 no let's go this Robo flashing around there's a natural body theophany who wants you a natural body theophany what it's a natural body a body not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to it's not a physical corporal body since the Alpha knee it's a body then that body returns back to picks up the glorified body so then it's not a glorified body that's the reason Jesus went to hell when he died he preached to the souls that were in prison turned back at the afternoon do you catch it repeat and now we're gonna go here if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved this early Tabernacle we have another one we have bypass that what we bypass will get it's in the hood that smells edit it I ask you to read it and go over over around talking about how we bypass and see what we bypass we Popeyes coming to where he did he come fool that fool we didn't come that way we come in him oh and then when we come to earth he had to divide itself that we could all be the parts of him we have bypassed that to come straight from God the attribute the flesh to be tempted and tested by saying like Adam did well when the testing and this word is over then we're taking up to this body and was from a prior for us before the foundation of the world that's the reason Jesus no to all things called he was word before he was flesh then we become door I brought around innocent who was just okay he said we become the word here you become the word as you receive the winner okay are we at it go to the next 127 trying to do God a service without it being his will he's up he's talking about he's coming what look a pice the curtain of time now where's that brother branham went beyond the curtain of time right now watch what he says there it was just the same as I'm preaching to you all there they stood sold under the altar crying how long he didn't mind using it not just to miss somebody who had intelligence how long Lord see why we feel that now and our age like brother brand like brother Dawson sitting here so under the altar he saw souls under the altar he saw the theophanies are those that had pie stone that's your soul can't go to the next one gods only provided place of worship in heaven of this place whatever woods I don't know what to call it referred to it dire as sold on the altar and who referred to it dire somebody did well now let's read the next one to see who said it referred to our souls under the altar go to the next from 29c and he comes down explaining to the girl that he was our oldest religion and the thing that stopped and off and what if I've passed over I want to see Jesus now remember that you remember when he went beyond the curtain of time you want to see Jesus he said you can't see him now this is the spirit sure said souls under the altar he's just a little higher someday he will return we'll go back to earth we don't eat or drink here but remember the man that talked to Abraham and the one Moses all could eat he fed him a kind that's the often he was inside the man so theophanies don't need to eat it's the afternoon with the inside of the man that met Moses said that met Mel chatted I mean was Mel charity than met Abraham maybe not using Moses called it's not figuratively speaking the Verteron said it was the back part of Jesus what is it folks God is not complete without you why because you're part of God right that's true you're part of God God is not complete we had to be before the foundation of the world but brother Dale I've always heard it not the often he was up in heaven where did you read it from the Prophet any expressing thinking that away what I've read to you is expressing its end down here which is your soul and like I said Sunday then what when you are born again brother Branham said your soul is not complete it only has the baptism now that's his words you need that quote when you're born again at faith your soul is not complete so then when you're born again at faith what's pulling you the headstone which is long within why can't we believe that your soul is your theophany in the new birth but something's pulling us which is the positive of God's mind so then we do have one in heaven you want to call it that let's read the scripture let's read this and we'll get this and catch a little bit go ahead we're number 32 second Corinthians 5:1 now watch this time for we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved now the point is if it were dissolved you can talk about something else right I mean I'm not an English major or you know I'm a stupid idiot but at least I can read well we know that if our earthly habitat now houses this tavern a word is out in other words if we die we have a building of God what happens you die body goes to great spirit goes to Garnica gave it so where does it go we have a building of God when house not made with hands look at him eternal in the heavens is there to eternalize do you have eternal out here and eternal life doc where is one of them partial realization the other one perfect realization what's calling you all right I don't have no problems with this song but the idea is calling me if they just knew what they were singing God is calling us to bring us up it's not something up there we're here we god has to come here to get us we don't go that we're not up dire and down here when it says you resurrect sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus does that mean you're up in heaven no that means you've reached the spiritual condition spiritual condition into your soul which is right now I haven't decided how to proceed on to the next part but I will say this much there's only one eternal God there's only one eternal theophany there's only one eternal soul Adam and Eve were the same in theophany you realized in if you have eternal life today you was back there not just back for the world he was back there in the garden when Adam and Eve Walter what out well you really have got me now I'm halfway understanding before the world now he throws me in the garden well we're yet if there's only one eternal life if there's only one solid it's eternal is it only one theophany this eternal that's the secret folks that Adam and Eve were the same in creation and run said she was in him in theophany an original creation you were there how did you get that you was before the foundation of the world in God as a part of God with right what was that he put in Adam and Eve will get the blasphemous names you go ahead and read it if you want to it's in blasphemous night where brethren said God breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he became a living soul eternal but he fell did he fall from eternal life in his soul or did he fall to human death in the flesh you answer it if you see Church you don't want to see the truth and listen to it listen for a minute I've got the notes written for it but I'll just tap it and forget it and go back and we'll try to come down to earth and start like we read a lot of Genesis 1:26 and 27 but do we ever read 28 if you think I'm wrong that there's only one theophany then we come from Jesus Christ by what the four knee hitting each other night he didn't know I had been the host we you know that we come by spiritual multiplication do you know that the seed has to come through the body right I don't mean it's got to come through the preacher now we didn't say that come through the body women can go out and preach the gospel to other women right come on get it right you got your own family to raise you got your own doing your women have a right but just don't get in the pulpit leave it alone why would you own it heaven help you want what you want I'd like for you to be lonely nice night and walk the house for hours if it's three o'clock daddy you don't want to preach cuz remember one thing for sure your soul is responsible for what you say and if you say it wrong it's death listen Church Adam and Eve were one in theophany you and Jesus Christ is one by the new birth is that true by receiving the new birth makes you one with Christ and part of God right come on that's out in the Baptist Church at least you could Amen the bad news you heard it in the Presbyterian that we were the children of God what's wrong with it now I don't know what he's gonna say I don't know whether I agree with it or not bring up Genesis 1:26 and through 28 and let's read it wait brother God said let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over the cattle now I can show you where brother Branham puts that physically even that's what I said I got a bunch of it rope he puts it physically we're supposed to rule over everything that's why the animals are scared of you over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth you know every creeping thing that creepeth upon your spiritual creation right theophany right so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he male and female created he them that's the one man right that's the eternal life that's Jesus Christ right now look what he says then God blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth well I don't know whatever I don't start right now because your mind is clicked replenish well it could have been something before this we don't know what maybe there was something like that before this one comes I don't know I got this quote what does the word replenish me Webster's definition says replenish means to do again or something over again that is not the word replenish the word replenish in the Hebrew lexicon is number 4390 it says to feel be full okay that got it this is the word replenish to feel be full to be full fullness abundance particle particular array is pronounced it to be fooled to be accomplished be ended to concentrate feel the hand to be filled beyond be satisfied she'll be any world without something to be done again well it says replenish now I'll tell you this and this is what I'm saying to you Adam and Eve was told two things one to replenish the earth with their spiritual offspring to to fill the earth as it finishes with Noah and Noah's told not to bring the spiritual Noah's told to bring the fear spurt of physical and to replenish the earth Adam and Eve were to do two things had sinned not entered the picture they would have brought forth the spiritual creation then they would have brought the natural because it would have come into natural bodies every what you want to say this happened to that happen whatever you say Adam and Eve was to bring forth because they were the only ones to bring because God never created it never stopped them and started another creation Adam and Eve was the male and female it would have brought the seed of God into the earth you tell me if that's not right ain't talking about natural seed we'll get that in a second we know they physically brought natural creation than the earth design causes the CNN tonight I thought you agreed while ago that we we believed in spiritual multiplication you believe in spiritual multiplication what a spiritual multiplication it's what it's being done by the Word of God the Word of God showed into the hearts of mankind was what Jesus done started spiritual multiplication in other words his offspring Adam and Eve were to bring us forth as spiritual multiplication you say oh no well I've got it laying there if you want to read it but around said Eve was the broke Christ forget it I ain't gonna argue with you I'll quote it to you Eve would have brought Christ but he said Satan got there too quick and brought the devil in his world and he said now you see how the world has been repopulated through the serpent seed see we quote 1 26 and 27 but we'd never gone to a 28 on his head that was what I was fixing to preach on but not that word it wasn't there so when I said on spiritual multiplication preaching the gospel is spiritual multiplication you sisters taking the gospel to the people around you testifying witnessing spiritual multiplication how does it come the seed has to come through the body not physically personally through the body of Christ a born-again believer to preach the gospel Eve would have finally done it and she not sinned what your prophet said we know it was not going to happen okay because everything was in the garden to know that it wasn't gonna happen because the man in the woman was made that away and if everything was fixed for them praying it that away it was not going to be that does not do away see when Jesus Christ come on this earth spiritual multiplication he was so in that word on the day of Pentecost they picked up that word come on brothers they picked up that word and it started into the Bride of Christ and it's right now it's spiritual multiplication that's why it's so dangerous to be a preacher why anybody would want to be a preacher I ain't never figured out because you realize it's so close it's so close to sowing the seed until you see the biggest force of the ministry older ministers this message when after adultery why I told you about it well they're getting ready the man some of you would know his name and he come to my house he used to preach he used to preach his spiritual seed he used to preach his seed and this seed and he had children born from the bride and the Millennium that's his brother were you messed up he had a dream they'd had a seed to plant he talked to a young girl into accepting that seed and produced a child I said where you messed up brother a preacher is supposed to preach the gospel he's sewing seed God was telling you to go preach not telling you to get a young girl pregnant it's so close it's very dangerous why do women flock to ministers because they can preach and get that he said you sure are on him there's one thing about it I tell it like it is it's the truth what about spiritual multiplication Adam and Eve was told while they were in theophany while they were in that spiritual creation they were told to multiply and replenish the earth what with the offspring of God right what were they to do in the spiritual creation to bring spiritual man but they fail to do it they would have spoke the word and it would have multiplied that's exactly what's happening now as the word is going forth is giving new birth to some but to some it's sealing them out because they don't know what you're talking about we're still in the spiritual multiplication every time you see a child born again that spiritual multiplication that's what Adam and Eve should have done but CN entered the picture and then they replenish the earth by sex the seed of the serpent what about it Lord willing we'll try to start to pick back up I got one more message in this before we get out of heaven I hope but listen do you see what it is to carry the gospel you see what it is for you to talk to somebody about the Word of God you see what it is to preach there are two just talk to people about the Word of God spiritual multiplication Satan never Poulin told on God he just helped him do it's perfect will understand what we got you might have an $8 open for me [Music] - were
