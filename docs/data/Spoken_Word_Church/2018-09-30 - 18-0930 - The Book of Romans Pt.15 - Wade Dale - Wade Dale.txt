========================================

high-tech stuff you got something she didn't handle I sweetheart jump powers you got a pacemaker right into the heart way inland waves down to the emergency room with chest pain okay okay let's just keep rim break all right let's get started here we go hope everybody had a good week we did all right we are we are rum we're not keeping being tips today get that out of there barnyard beans that's my buddy over and over again and then we've been reading Romans 8 and we're talking about adoption last weekend still in Romans 8 but we're going to continue on and let's just go back and read it again because I think it really is necessary let's start with verse 14 where as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for we have not received the spirit of bondage that's what you were warmly you were born with the spirit of bondage because it bound you to this earth it bound you I'm talking about this afternoon brother Branham talks about your soul already being resurrected you're sold already raptured well we just gotta understand that I'm telling you it's in the Bible we're sitting handling places this that handling place but the Bible says were sitting handling placing we're gonna find out that the very thing is going to change our body is in the Bible it's been in the Bible for it is out here where else you think we're gonna get it from the way to not see the spirit of bondage again to fear we received the spirit of adoption I'm not adoption the spirit of adoption you have to be adopted into the family first before you can come into the line of adoptions everybody agree with that all right my brother Dale always says that God will not adopt Satan's kids and that's right because you don't have to he can't adopt a kid come down I have you don't adopt your own gentlemen okay we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry daddy daddy and that was our point last Sunday when you become a newborn babe in Christ you are a baby you make mistakes you crawl you drink milk but fortunately there's a growth development where you got to grow up all right and that's what this is talking about because we are definitely heirs when we're born into the family you become a complete adder right there but it's like we've always said I'm not going to give brother Bobby's gotcha Zack now he can drive that can drive why because he's of age but when that was born or even when he's got him now he's got his set of twins beautiful little girls got one on each side of their nose and got five fingers on each hand one what they're human they have the ability to drive a car but you gonna give you keys to Zoe this why you need a human one chief again she's in you he's your family come with your huh they're your family is your little girl you see what I'm saying that's the same thing God said thank giving my keys to that kid right because remember grams in power without characters to tempt they've got the power they're human beings they happen in two they're intelligent they can do things but when you come to a place of driving a vehicle which would be something you could really hurt somebody with you didn't we're doing then you come to a place to where the world says you have to be 16 years old I don't see I don't know where they got that from they you probably need to be about 20 or 25 before they start driving but but we have determined that they come to a stage of maturity and there's things that they can do nobody riding the car when they're baby all the way up to here but there's a point in time where you will you will they already asked me for the keys I see them already for the key to the collar right every kid wants to get in a car and drive it right like that little kid remember a little kid not too long ago with what seven or eight years old got that car and started baby yep Grover down the road course it was pretty disastrous hits and when you run it into the trash can in the trees but you know what though he had the capacity to do it but what the government our common sense would tell you not to give the kid key same way we've got man if you can't get anything out of anything we're talking about get one thing you can sit by the things we see God works by the things that we say right because we can relate to that right there we did not give our car keys to our son until they were 16 18 whatever right God's not going to give you the car keys to the Word of God until you're mature enough to handle it and see remember we're not perfect so we can make mistakes and give the car keys prematurely but he doesn't he doesn't do anything prematurely he knows exactly when you need it but what you have to do is though you got to eat to get better to grow up you gotta eat you gotta you gotta fuel your mind and fuel your body to come to a place to where you don't cry daddy daddy when you come to maturity of the Word of God even who whether someone was preaching not too long ago did Moses why cry that's what most problem one day gotcha shut up bait okay same thing with same time with them all that beautiful many pens but we've not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but we've seen the spirit of adoption whereby we cry daddy day so we knew we are in line of adoption if we're born again okay they'll ask you a question came to me today I mean the other day why did the Bible say that Jesus was constrictive the thing about cognitive thing the thing that was formed in married why do they have to be by the Holy oh I felt God was his father I thought the father produced them not in that with not at that point no no we know they're the same person we're not trying to Terry but the reason it was a Holy Ghost is because that's the only way you can get birth it's by the Holy go that's right the Holy Ghost shall come upon you the Holy Ghost will come upon you we know it was the father we know that but listen why did the Bible not say the father will come to you and you'll conceive in birth time he said the Holy Ghost is gonna come and overshadow you and we know it when open life came from the father but it the Holy Ghost ended see you and I when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost we receive the holy of himself the person of God we know that but still it makes it so simple the gun used the Holy Ghost to birth himself Jesus so he's going to use the Holy Ghost to birth his children and then okay they all right with that because remember you know what struck me sunbrella rhythm when brother branham when brother branham uses his analogy of of the trinity he goes to that scripture and he says he said that says here Mary was found with a child of the Holy Ghost and he said now when Jesus grows up why like this when Jesus grows up he says my father yeah so the trinitarian is now they have three they got Jesus and they got the Holy Ghost and they got the Father okay but brother ground his plan it's the same person but remember its position right listen Jesus Christ is not on the earth today in a physical form he's in the form of the Holy Ghost right and the people to want to birth us just like he was birth don't remember he was birth right the first time you and I were birth wrong the first time what I'm looking at now but to me birth are born again we have to be birthed pocoyo same way Jesus came because look the reason I struck me is because look they're here if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ that means whenever he did we get so he got birthed by the Holy Ghost we get work but then that makes us have the same father if I write with it it just gives a little more understanding to do what's going on and I you know you get these little tidbits and it opens up a whole new world because you know last Sunday I was preaching on oh no now that Jesus Christ didn't restore off them and then you know I'm kind of felt a little can you prove he did I pretty big drifters in then right he restore all things Jesus made a way for to be restored hey you'll be proven again jesus walks out of the tomb and he says all power in heaven and earth been given unto me right all power I can move through dimensions I can take this flesh body because remember Satan had just a little bit of hold on I tried to find a quote but brother Graham had this one quote Reese's Satan had a hold of that because remember he disputed the body of Moses so he hasn't he has what we called dibs or a tag of this body because when it was born from Satan comes jesus said if you be the Son of God that you know - there's no fall off the building and all this stuff he really didn't get it but when Jesus walked out of that tomb and he says all power on him Murphy give unto me I told the least means and I would come with it why didn't he just move over into another dimension and take the devil's head go see you later buddy yeah why didn't you do that if he was to restore all things yeah he needed a bride he needed a bride to defeat the devil and we know it's him through them but why did he when he said all power so everything was given to him he could've walked over said devil this is your heater last moment say goodbye he could have done that those remember when he goes to the lake of fire that lets him in the lake fire let's go back don't remember y'all hear this again this afternoon but I believe it's lovely because Satan is not a human he's an angel the Bible says we will judge and we'll talk about a little bit to be continued the rest of the story of me this afternoon the spirits they'll bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of God so we are the children of God when were born but we're still babies and if children then heirs heirs of God what the father and joint heirs with Christ so whatever Christ got we got he got a body changed we get a butter cake he gets a resurrection we get a resurrection whatever Jesus that's what we got do we really believe that we better start bleeding all right so that's the only way we're gonna have a resurrection it's not believe it's coming what we were talking about Benjen this this morning comes from came to church we will listen to one anyway the Gospel grades they were talking about one day the trumps gonna sound and the graves are going to open up and it the trumps already sounded but sees their idea or their denomination are there horses that horse rider has rope through their life telling them that one day and you know though it's like The Walking Dead you know it really is it's horrible that Satan has given this and it's false it has no truth to the college phones but they live by that's why I said thank God for truth we know that the shout deploys the Trump all of that we got the message the trumpet will not come from Jesus coming what they're thinking is is we don't have enough power to do anything so we got to wait for Jesus our slashed brother branham you don't talk about people thing but brother I'm gonna come back slash brother Brown has got to come back and give us something extra to give us that little loop the hope came in 1,100 sermons brother Hamza dragonfly books in the tapes not not something coming something is doing that alright bye alright for that but welcome the voice of the resurrection will come from the bride of Jesus Christ we know it's Christ right but why didn't he just get everybody out of him some of the Saints dead right some of the Old Testament Saints I don't understand why some of them did someone didn't I don't understand that but when we come down to the very end of this thing will read you a quote not in here but up steadily well brother Maurice that scripture by joking he said you would judge each other because when those books are open in Revelations 20 or 21 there's a host of people with that book and how they gonna be getting deeper gonna be judged by you that's the only judgment there is there's a judgment about what somebody has proclaimed and then you'll be together noise don't know why I did it not one more time why didn't Jesus just when you come up out of that gravy go Devils sinners Saints come on the ground it don't work that way that would be too easy he said these are the completed ministry here on earth I tried it take us now write us see I never thought about that to it until the other day when even I read it were Jesus was on the mountain with motors and align them if you heard a sermon you heard what I say hey you don't read that in the book but brother Brown said Moses and Elijah was telling there was something Jesus didn't know about his second coming well see because all power in heaven herbs nothing you doing listen God had a human brain mm-hmm when Jesus was held her he had a white matter of human brain just like me in you and he had to work in that that was his box at that time in humanity had to work in that humanity Tony never said oh I would never have to give on the mentally come out of the grave with a glorified body right so Moses and Elijah was telling her about what his second coming now why do you need to know about a second coming man this guy supposed to know everything he's an eternal God he was Jesus to human man because right here is joy nares if it was if it was Jesus Christ a superhuman man which we know he was listen but he's certain things he didn't do remember he had to leave a city because of their unbelief he couldn't heal them and you think of me and you man that was not on my end you in class you just walk in a room and go everybody's healing yet that don't work God don't work that way you weren't screwed viewing beings hey that's his that yes that's his whole basis is to be defeat Satan comes remember Lucifer and Michael fault he didn't kill Sam he defeated it there's a time when he'll be destroyed yesterday so what's gonna happen here any potential destruction is gonna happen Satan's gonna move out of this this and we're gonna take a lotta change but I say it's still gonna be a lot until all judgment is finished then who's gonna stand in judgment he's gonna stand in judgment who's the judge the Saints shall judge the world the world the Saints will judge the world and we will even judge angels are each good cook that write him a note but you see what were we we love it sometimes we look at things if we go God is this limitless God will he is and it's in the form of the eternal even the Creator though he come down walk with Adam and Eve why did he just stop the fall you know thought about that he's Almighty God he knew that was gonna happen the day he put out of believing you and flesh he knew they were gonna say it but he never said our name uncle sin don't tell them no it wouldn't be free moral agency right that's right that wouldn't be free moral agency God had to allow that to happen so that he could come and be a redeemer and make a way for Elijah to restore all things Collective policy about Elijah shall truly come to restore we know some ministry Jesus Christ I'm not you understand I'm not throwing him out or belittling I'm telling you how it I don't have words so that we can understand things like the Holy Ghost overshadowing made that to me that's a it's a great revelation so you can see what God did to me in you because it wouldn't be heirs and joint heirs if he didn't come that way because really you're not doing that with Christ unless you're born again mm-hmm okay then I understand they're cold and air means you're in the family so in other words what I'm saying is see that really debunks don't the that debunks the the I'm gonna try to put this easy the false doctrine that Jesus was just a man until the River Jordan yeah well if he was then he was a sinner like me in you no way okay we're doing it with cross because we're born again of the Holy Ghost he was he had the Holy Ghost this spirit lost the Spirit of God does look if so they'll be we suffer with him that we may be what glorified together we will stand one day I promise you you'll stand one day in your humanity and you'll say all power in heaven and earth has been given unto me if he said then you gonna be able to say and then what's gonna happen is all the other heirs will come out the ground if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if Soviet will suffer him that we might be glorified together for our ranking that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in Jesus know what I say oh that fruit of the morning in hey that's alright well I'm that man you running on wedding up here but he's gonna be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature are the creation and for those of you the cocky Carla did you notice they upgraded now you've got these little like Scofield has the footnotes in the middle come if you touch that G guess what looky creation they just upgraded about probably a month ago that you can do that now I love it so you got your here vanity slip no it's utility I like what take Carlo brother Massey Braille of his too and I get to turn them home destinies he enjoyed it for the creature our creation thanks Peck tation that waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creation was made soon as a vanity why not willingly the world didn't fall willingly it fell because the top dog Adam and Eve did what they did when they fell everything fell underneath it all right go by the reason of him who have subjected the same and hope in other words Christ had become the second Adam to bring it back because the creature or creation itself also shall be delivered so if you want if you you know we got to eat some paints on our body but if you see all these tsunamis and you see all these earthquakes and you see all these things going on yes mining your fault because when we come to full restoration that all stop hmm I said when we crisis already later deeper crisis already out full restoration he is himself one man that's why no man has reached immortality except what one man Christ right right but that scripture will be expanded when it happens to men you okay but the creature was may sell you the manatee not willingly one by the fall but by reason of heaven suggested the same in Hope because the creature itself awful shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption that's the whole thing we're seeing its corruption see even Jesus's body was corrupted it did corrupt him the grave but it was getting old your bodies corrupting as that's why that's why the me Satan didn't have a pet I mean same kind of problem looking at Jesus listen same taking upon he'll say he took me to the synagogue they took me places and he said maybe get home you get no I believe God hid all that from the devil the devil saw enough of it though to go into Herod and all these different ones to try to kill the babies but he couldn't do it because God was hiding himself in simplicity somebody oughta preach a sermon because the creature itself it's always won't get to the end of the chapter yes money shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God all right you and I for we know Paul for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now we can say that now that was 2000 years ago we can say that now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit firstfruits of the Spirit is what the firstfruits to come to maturity Paul wasn't Paul came to maturity in his age his spot his box he came to matter in his box but that's not full maturity okay you and I are full firstfruits because you're not a firstfruits of the Resurrection we'll get into that a little bit later on which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves and don't you you know the Bible says that the only way you can tell the person born again is for you sign crop for the abomination done in the city but we sign cry for the things that go around the world is happening to all these people and and we know that it's because we are not coming to door D to be able to and you have to be able to help everybody but we will be able to and we're gonna say this be so much of a witness til like brother Brown said they'll go the foolish virgin they're going to come in and ask us for the oil because we're the last word they know where to go why because they know the sign that they have the oil the wise bird doesn't have the oil so a little foolish virgins they don't have the oil they don't go to Walmart look for oil they come to the five wise virgins to try to get oil from them so they know where to go I believe we'll have signs and wonders been able if it won't be a public show so you don't think you can go and stand on the street corner and he'll everybody driving by a car in a car no which is not going to happen all right because remember everybody's got their own idea about the third pole but brother Brown told himself start pulling the opening of the words because they may pass this part this part the opening of the word and nobody's had before and it makes this word warm bright it doesn't make this you know like for Robbins Billy Graham and even brother ground that's all they have their box they're gone they're waiting on us to get them out of the ground we have it in possession they have one anointing yes but it's not inside it's not something they can possess it hasn't become a possession to the to the wise virgin is the possession you're actually not you actually don't have one you are the one you are the owner you're the oil they poured in the lamps and even in the Old Testament y'all remember a long time ago but I preached the sermon about the the bride is not a time the price amount of time people the whole the whole Bible talk to us we're not a time you show on the time for Christ know if you're top of crashing beat the devil hello alright that's what st. one to me if we're not God made manifest they were second persons and that makes us the devil all right but we got to see ourselves in the word mm-hmm and beat the work that's why when we're going to get into the Son of Man the Sun man is the Word made flesh what are you enough with the word make like we're literally this word literally this word made flesh walking on the air mm-hmm like I said last time be we keep talking about thing and if we keep prophesying about things we're gonna die those prophets have to die even the greatest prophet that ever lived in replaces the our teachers Christ be profit yeah do that but they'll come a group of people that will not be a prophesy and group of people so that's what's happened not even in the denominational world whoa grandmom says well you know twenty years now uses makeup then 20 years I love 20 years later Jesus went on watching prophesied she did die they die he do prophesy much died you and I are not we think we are prophetic people but we're not all prophets but if you prophesied you're not you show me one to do this whole bottle full of prophecy and every person that wrote this Bible had to die sometime somewhere right right but the resurrection is a lively for people not a dead food a lot of young people when we know the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together till now and not only with a for ourselves off it was how the first with the spirit even we ourselves groan there except waiting for the adoption to wit our to witness or to understand the redemption of the body I think we're understanding it now because the problem right the problem with everybody is is here you stand and 65 million miles away you say I didn't tell my body shame that's the truth just like I said gonna want said well I ain't coming now with heat Lord's coming this was telling Jim we were coming down the road all the whole world thinks that God is just going to come on it's one certain day and the it but man look at all the things they miss they missed the trumpet the show the voice they missed the first resurrection burdens our first resurrection Jesus when the first but I learned resurrection the whole world isn't it the whole world misses the bride leaving the whole world nobody understands that now after half of us there'll be a group of people that will try program so they'll have to be killed because what they believe they're going to try they going to see they've been told wrong because it's not you read there's not - there is - resurrection but this one they miss they're all looking at the general resurrection even mark them when we Viktor Bout Oleanna Lord we know in the general resurrection in the last day that allow groups will resurrect jesus said i am michael what a larger problem well know where the problem what you didn't know holy though if she'd had a hold ago she could still drive beside jesus said i am too but at that moment in the box they were Enda but now it can happen so we are saved by hope we explained that last week I ain't got time to do that right now but we're saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope what is the hope he is part of faith because remember you have to have faith for something you can't see but hey when Abraham had the baby when him and Sarah had the baby he didn't have to believe for a child no more see that's what you and I got to come to because Abraham actually prophesied that he's gonna have a baby well one day had the baby but now remember to be physically died later on promise was fulfilled at least in promises fulfilled and there you terminal promises but the person you tell one say the person that process I had to die we are prophetic we have prophetic insight insight but you and I are not prophets we're a little Messiah has sure all those things that go together but we're not prophets if we prophet if we are a prophet we are saying something isn't right you got to get back to where Jesus never said thus saith the Lord now brother branham even said to us that the Lord you can't say that stay at the Lord and take a body came that's prophesy because the Bible doesn't say if you saved us that the Lord this mountain will be moved the Bible said if you say I heard a preacher not too long ago and I really enjoyed what he said he said that didn't say if you were a Christian it didn't put any stipulation at all he just said if you say to this mountain be moved and doubt not down in your heart it will come to pass that's my human man take this stuff you see human men can do stuff that's correct and we can if you'll notice a lot of times bro they'll walk by and he lay his hand on you and he'll talk to you or something you know what he's doing I hope you do because I've had it happen to me a couple times you needed something then just one man I I'm just not for this and it's on the Internet I'm not far this shouting and jerking their hair off and throwing them on the floor and you know God's not death God it's not death you don't need you to listen Jesus never raised his voice to the Bell now the neighbors were screaming I read it yesterday and Landreth I mean the team no they don't mean Legion I don't they were why are you here before your time can we go on the swing Jesus didn't go no go I'm sorry prayer lines are fine but did you get something at the end of our did you just get an emotion Jesus never did that and you watch run around and prayer he never done the same thing he would actually just lay his hand or he would never even let his hands he say our system he never raised his voice never if he raised his voice well I think would when he was get quiet you at the end of another play matter of fact you in lovely jerk they say yeah that's what I mean we do all this screaming in : and I mean you've we've done it slap them on the ground and shook them and you know hair pins flying everywhere a man got to person something right but that's not the way it's supposed to be done okay that's not the way we were I don't you know what that come from penticoff I come from the waving of the leaves like you were talking about last Sunday that did not come from I say didn't come from God all healing comes from God all right so don't get me wrong but that is not the proper way because we're not gonna watch the prophets of bale one today day they cut their self jumped all over the place for an hour to get their God to come like it walks up and says pour the water on and died if you be the guy in other words the God of Israel show yourself brother Brown said Elijah and I already had a vision that it's gonna happen so we had a lot of faith you know you have a lot of faith when God shows you a vision that's already gonna happen I mean actually to me that's that's just common sense when God shows you a vision that that tomorrow that you're going that you're going to be driving down the road and you see this car coming and for you to pull over and then they have this massive wreck in front of you and then tomorrow you go to the same place and you pull over that match the track nappin I mean I'm not fail you got fear out of fear I fear when I don't see something right that's what I fear comes from because that's what hope that is seen is not hope cuz it's think I don't hope I'm in church today I'm standing here I don't even have faith that I will be at church but we knew we have patience those those of us it needed for what a man says why is he a hope for it but if we hope for what we see not then do we with patience wait for let's see what does it perseverance those who endure well we've got a toy now eagerly wait what this is though this is the this is the original this is the original Greek this part right here this is your interpreter this is your King James Version and then what in the original it says eagerly wait I didn't bring them to break up brought my own birthday the correction it should say eagerly wait while Isis paired off also help the time for our needs we all have infirmities the stranded just went through an infirmity well of the infirmity for we know not what we should pray for as we ought sometimes you don't know how to pray right sometimes you really just don't know how to write that's right for we know not what we should pray for as we offer lunch but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered in other words inside yourself how many times some of you been woke up before I'm going to walk up a couple of times a person's come on my mind pray for him and you found out they was having a hard time just to clean I did it with dad you know called him and said you know couldn't get in touch with it but see there's things working inside of us that a lot of times we don't see it remember when I told you last Sunday about them about the garden you know you plant the seed and you cover it up you go out there and you stand there for you know five days in a row and you don't see anything let only nothing going on underneath there that seeds gonna absorb moisture cracked open that thing's got a kernel out of it's shell all that's working and you don't see nothing in the earth then it's been put in sometimes you don't see it but all of a sudden yes girl by the way just growing rich thank you sister yes even though graves open up yeah through the wall that's why we'll get into that when we get into food this Mel Kennedy brother Brown explains it very very very very well I mean you don't leave anything spirit cousin picks up the bottom of the soul picked up the theophany he calls it picks up the body that body ain't coming out the ground was out quick well that bodies data and there's a lot of people that's already gone back to this okay but they're underneath that's one of it if you'll see what I'm saying we're gonna read it we've read a couple of Sundays ago just to give you a little teaser then we're playing it the Bible says we're planted and corruption when we go put somebody in the grave we plant them back into the earth above they're raised in incorruption so what comes out of that ground they what went in that's me think of what's happening that theophanies going to come back and change that literal body they lived in to a young person again they're going to step out they don't have to metaphorically yeah they'll come out of the ground dip the foot on the earth but no it's change it's just like that don't get that body and they'll come walking through the doors or through the wall or whatever with no resistance so it's not going to be a lot of it's not gonna be what we even think that he's just gonna be but we're developing into the children are developing to where they can understand what daddy's already saying alright so that's what the Bible says we plant them in corruption and that's the truth we put them in the ground they've not a person one in the ground that didn't have a corrupt body except Jesus and it would occur up did it be lifted in there another go Glassman was in there for days and his body was already stained them they say okay but that didn't harm see we look and we take all this body changed things on you know next Sunday I believe for the next Sunday after that we're going to talk about all these funny changes inna had to have a body changing throat somewhere because he ain't in this dimension you can't take this flesh into another dimension you can't do that right even brother Browns flesh couldn't go into that other dimension it had to stay in the bed there had to be a separation there so that's a lot of things we get into and we're not going to get things to this so let's go
