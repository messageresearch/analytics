we need a little bit tomorrow i'm sure the way he's going this morning i don't think he'll wear out that's right we'll just depend on it all being there right so let's just sing open the eyes of my heart i see shining in the light of your glory shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love me hearts once again heavenly father lord we counted another honor lord to be gathered in your house this evening ask now lord that you would take our words and things that are said tonight lord may they be for your glory and honor may they strengthen your people tonight father we pray lord anoint the speaker anoint the hearts to be able to receive father we ask it in jesus name amen amen amen isaiah chapter 61. i'll just read verse one and we'll just continue on from this morning the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings into the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and to open of the prison to them that are bound may god at his blessing you may be seated this evening this morning we talked a little bit about the one at the well and you know when jesus began talking to her she knew what the sign of the messiah was yet when he tells her what her problem is she didn't get mad she didn't get upset with it she didn't say who told you jesus who told you what i was doing you know a lot of people today if a minister when he begins to preach and the holy spirit begins to take over and he begins to get into different places and maybe deal with issues and things that you know people say well who told the preacher yeah who told him what i was doing who who exposed me well i'll tell you who the same messiah that exposed the woman at the well it's still yet the same one today that exposes our lives that's what the anointing is for is to come and it opens up our lives till it becomes an open book to the father that he can look down in there put the thing in the minister's mouth hey there's sometimes you say things you don't know why you say it right right but when the anointing comes there's somebody there that's drawing on the gift of god and maybe they don't even realize that they have a need but the holy spirit knows what our need is therefore that's why a lot of things were said brothers says this he says and this being your spirit led by god you become a messenger of god or an angel right god's messenger god's angel is the very same word you can't separate it god's messenger or god's angel which has the greatest authority an angel from heaven or an angel at the pulpit right which has it he says the angel at the pulpit paul said if an angel from heaven comes and preaches any other gospel to you than which i've already preached let him be accursed so the anointed angel with the holy spirit and with the with the word stands next to god right right stands next to god amen so if an angel comes and he stands beside me this evening right here if you could come stand visible right here you'd probably be distracted by him yeah what what's he saying right what's he gonna say what's he gonna do right but if we really believe what the prophet said you would say the one that's most important to me tonight is not the one standing right here beside the minister but it is the one that's been bought with the prize the one that's received the holy ghost who was a sinner saved by grace the one that's received the horn of all that anointing for this service that's the one that's interesting to me he's the one that's got the word gloria listen no one here didn't have the word he's not been bought with a price he can't deliver tonight he he can bring and bring a message or whatever it is but brother said the most important one is the one behind the pool amen he's the one that's been anointed for the service and you're the ones that spend the night hey brother taught us that angels ushered us to our seats right right so there's angels lined up around the walls and in this middle of the night and sitting beside each person right amen but the attraction's not on the angel that's right that's not the main attraction right that's not why the holy spirit is come right he didn't come to bless angels he come to bless people that needed a blessing he come to to strengthen the brethren that needed strengthening in their bodies he come to anoint you to be able to hear the word of god amen he comes to anointed man the anointing to be consecrated to be dedicated and to let the word of god speak when jesus was leaving the scene he tells him he says go to an upper room and sit there right and wait jesus how long we got to wait that wasn't the problem that wasn't you know what john could have said well you know what peter i think we've been here long enough we've been here eight days sure that we've got what he's talking about amen if they were left in eight days they still wouldn't have been the horning right they still yet had the same old desires that instead had the same old trouble with the you know with everything going home but when they waited there till the holy ghost came it made a difference in their life amen because now when they leave the upper roof they're changed individuals they don't have that same desire yeah the flesh is still going to get in your way but the spirit man down on the inside is to bring this old man subject to the word amen if you read there in revelations chapter 1 verse 9 i'm john who i'm also your brother and companion in tribulation and in kingdom and impatient of jesus christ was in the isle of patmos that is called patmos for the word of god for the testimony of jesus christ and i was in the spirit of the lord today and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last what thou seest write in the book send it into the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus unto samaria on the pergamus and the thytaira and the sardis and the philadelphia and the laodicea and i turned to see the voice which spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden camel sticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one light and through the son of man glove with a garment down to the foot gird about the patch with a golden girdle and his head and his hairs were white like wool amen as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace in his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when his sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strip and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead right and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death write these things which thou has seen and these things which are and these swings which shall be hereafter and the mystery of the seven stars which thou saws in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the seven angels to the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which i saw are the seven churches so now jesus has gone away but he promised to return again glory so now he comes down and the next time we find him here in the scripture now in revelation he is standing in the midst of his churches amen and in his head there was the seven stars that represented the you know the seven messengers and here they are in the seven church ages and now they are having a transferal of the special spirit yeah a special part that was before the throne of god now comes out to each one of them and rests upon each man to have a specific ministry for a specific time right so a church world's taking place because jesus ain't here anymore right in the corporal body but now he comes back to anoint messengers amen each day with a message right and in each age there's men that rose up against the message sure paul had people rise up against him and teach the resurrection was already exactly and paul goes a little further than most of us do paul begin to call their names yeah right they may come to that someday but we have to identify him so paul begins calling their names out this one right here and this one over here they're teaching their resurrections already past right and they're over throwing the faith of something right that's right amen well brothers what number does it make what doctrine i believe if it's a false doctrine it makes amendments amen see god called us to believe the pure word not part of the word or not our own intellectual idea the word he sent a revealed word in every age and that was the word that was going to put that part of the church in a rapture right and you ain't going to get by living on paul's day right you're going to get by living on luther's day and you ain't going to get by living on a wealthless day because there's a greater anointing that's coming this day and that's the message we have to preach now you know when paul comes he begins preaching and of course the word of god always comes to a prophet right so here he's teaching other men of god titus and timothy and you know timothy was a young man and he must have had people saying something about it because paul tells him in first timothy 4 and 12 let no man despise thy you right be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation and in charity in spirit in faith and impurity and you just look at the messages timothy brought to the church right right he preached the anointed word for his day exactly did he get rid of him you better believe me then did people make fun of him you better believe that but did he quit preaching you better believe he did right because there was something on the inside of him that drove him to preach what he preached amen hey paul's already made the stigma if somebody else come preaching something different let him be a curse and timothy is taking that word that paul preached right how did they try them in those days to know whether they said hey you know what you're not preaching what paul preached therefore you're false yeah right false exactly well this is what god revealed to me well it's not what paul said right exactly right you know it's like the man said brother said brother do you know that that lady right there has been married three or four times and well brother the lord give me a dream and you know she's the time to be with her and he says well the dream's not divine but it didn't come from god oh god didn't give you that dream listen god ain't gonna take you contrary to his word anything that takes you contrary to the word is not of god right so then down through the dark ages as times things begin to creep out you know the light begin to go out then although once god brings in luther and a little bit of light begins to shine and wesley comes on and brings a little more light and then but there was a promise that in the seventh day there were seven stars in his hand right not eight right five men bro there's nobody around here believes in eight messengers won't go overseas a few times yeah and people down there they sometimes they don't know what they believe they don't have everything like you do they just believe what some white brother tells them right they don't have all the language in their interpretation but now if you come in the first stage and he was a prophet and he's alpha yeah then the last one must be the prophet right because he's still the omega right and the alpha has become the omega so they had if there was a prophet to begin with there must be a prophet to end with so that corn of wheat that went down in the ground had to come forth and make a mature wheat exactly and there's going to be people who become mature that's right listen program says when i was there and he says i went over you know he'd seen the preview of the bride and he said the first bride that went by oh she was so in line with the word and her hair was just red and her dress was just right they were playing onward christian soldiers every one of them was marching right on and he said then all of a sudden he said the bride of america must come and grieve you right brother brown said i looked and i begin to weep thank god is this what we as ministers have produced right we have an anointed word and we produce this they you know the story about brothers they didn't have any clothes on and they were beating to the rock of rock beating to the to the tune of rock and roll music and they were dancing all in bulgarian ways you know just all vulgar and he says oh god surely this ain't what we produce and all of a sudden that voice spoke behind him again and he said now the bride must come and preview again amen but there was an alpha there had to be an omega right and you were the omega part of the bride because this is the last day when he came and he was the ones that he saw there in that preview when she was walking onward christian soldiers and he said there at the end a couple of them began getting out of step and he said i come through myself crying out get back in line right yeah and the last thing he saw he said was her trying to get back instead right with the gospel and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud rainbow upon his head and his face as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire in verse seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets now brother brown never he never sets right down and he says look at me he never says i'm the one yep we know by the signs and all the vindication he was the seventh angel right right and we know the mighty angel the prophet said none other could it be than christ right which is the anointed one and so now then brother comes along and why christ speak in 1963 and he says pardon this but it's just coming to me coming up in me i gotta say it was he that said that day up there inside of that woods you have no game right and he created he never said i created right he created three squirrels standing there before us right what is it just speaking the word saying there will be there and there and there was there there was it was he that did charlie rodney is down there in kentucky and nelly margin the rest of you it was he the same god that was back there and spoke to moses and said why do you cry to me speak the word right and he brought them into existence oh it's him oh my it was he that give division about a year ago and said that we would go over there in the seven seals and and now there will be a great thunder it would start off and they would be a shape of a pyramid and it'd be a look magazine like magazine and it packed it and it's hanging on the wall in there it was he that sat down hey man exactly was he was it a rocket amen it was angels right it was he that said that right it was he yes it was he that said turn it to the right right exactly and brother says that is our lord up there amen it was he that night when i was going down the road and seeing that great big mama snake about to get my brother and he said you've been given power to bind him or any of the rest of them amen right see it was he that said that morning when he woke me up in the room standing there in the corner said don't fear to do anything or to go anywhere or to say anything for the never failing presence of jesus christ is with you wherever you go listen god has no respect a person it was he up yonder in slovenia canyon i was standing there and a sword dropped in my hand and said this is the king's sword it was he it was he that said to me as i was with moses so i'll send you it was he that said to me standing there with a little preacher on the river 30 years ago standing there when that light and the same pillar of fire come down from heaven and stood there and said as john the baptist forerunned the first coming of christ your message shall we run the second coming amen paragraph 2 98 he said oh how it was he that said in prophecy through the mission it shall come to pass it was he see programs never pointing us to himself right right he said i was only there right exactly he just used me he used my voice he used my hands he used my lips right right it was he that said if one among you prophesies or see a vision that tells it and it comes to pass then remember it's not him it's me right i am with him he says oh my i could go on and on and on so we understand then that revelations 10 1 was sending a message down to an earthquake messenger by a transferral is taking place he's giving a messenger something that nor the messenger has ever had the responsibility to deliver before this is a message like none other all right this is a message that's going to cause the rapture right right matter of fact this message is the starting of the rally exactly so christ is the anointing and he sent it down with a horn of all amen to anoint the bride of christ with the word and influence her with his anointing right and calls that word because the word had to come to a prophet right right so he had to choose one that was a prophet sure he didn't choose me to bring the word you choose anybody else's brain exactly right he chose one to bring it and listen so the prophet of this day must anoint the people that's right i'll just use this yeah the two lids on there good yeah so here's the word the spirit and the word and he brings it down upon the people right and he begins to pour it upon me man listen he didn't dab it upon him right give me just a little bit yeah and i'll give you just a little bit yeah i'll give you a little bit of the word no no in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mysteries of god should be finished not that there's gonna have to come somebody else in and and bring a new revelation no he's pouring out that horn of all upon the bride that was his job and it is our job to do repeaters of what he said and hunt down the bride with the anointed word glory exactly so it's more than just anointing the sons of levi right more than just anointing king david or not in some altar he's anointing sons and daughters of god who has been bought with a place he's taken people listen and the angel said i'll give you a sign in the hands and if they won't believe the sign in the head i'll give you another sign and you'll know the thoughts and the intents of their hearts and that'll catch them right let me tell you i don't want to just be hanging around here just because of the first poll where even because of the second pool that's not necessarily what we're feeding on glory all right exactly that was the lure right to catch the fish right but lord when they catch me don't let me nipple on it don't let me be one of those little bitty fishies that he reeled in that the lure was bigger than the fish no let me be that rainbow trout that great big real fish that he hooked on to her that's the bride and he said don't you take it and explain it like you tried to explain the rest of it because you're not feeding on the mind of a man right exactly i quoted that at home one day and a minister there he doesn't come anymore but he did and he comes up to he didn't come up to me come to the another brother minister after church he said what's mother jason trying to do do you unlikely brother branham yeah because i quoted a quote i didn't tell him it was a quote you obviously hadn't listened to enough tapes yeah all right and he'd been a preacher for 50 years so it don't matter how long you're in this thing right that don't save you right it matters who you know and he goes well i just quoted you know the quote you're not feeding on the mind of a man a mind of the words of a man of fail but you're feeding them the unfailing mighty word of the son of lamb and his words cannot for help amen but it's doing the way of the prophet no you didn't know who the prophet was hey all right it come to fulfill luke 17 and 30. he come to reveal the son of man amen listen any and brother in the angel tells brother abraham he'd say well brother i'm just come up with these sons no i didn't come up with these sermons they ain't the lord told him what to preach you have to believe that right and he says you know you tell them about this one and you tell them about that one and you tell them about the woman at the whale you tell them about abraham you tell them about nathaniel and about the woman at the world and you tell them that's the sign of the messiah and when they seen that sign happening amongst them people begin to believe oh yeah who has this man that's right a lot of people back when brother bran was here didn't know he was no more than just a prophet right well at least they recognize the word for their day there's one tape there and i can't remember exactly which one it was but michael your mother and then were there when he says he says he looks at the people and he says i seen all of you there well i earned that service you're not open if i still there huh i was there when george washington crossed the delaware right i was there at calvary i was there in the mind of god before the foundation of the world i had to be here in this time to fulfill this part of the bride because i'm going to be part of them by god's grace that are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord and shall not taste death but i will be changed come on amen somebody's got to fulfill amen i'm 90 years old i don't care if you're 115 years old he could come before morning right now man all right and the angel said tell them there's a certain group of people they're scattered all over the world and denominations and in every and every man-made thing there is and they're in cages and they're in prisons of satan but tell them that i'm gonna i'm gonna deliver them right i'm gonna set them free from the cage that they're in remember the the dream roller boarders had he was rattling the cages and he was saying oh brother branham deliver us from this house of hell and brother adam was trying to find him and you know the the the dream and he was sitting there and brother madam just began speaking the word right right because it's the word that sets people free you think about how much oh well brother jason he was so annoying he sweated hey i think of work and i swear don't make me annoyed yeah but i do believe it's a loading chair and he told me he said take this voice to them and cry out against them right cry out against it come out of her my people be it upper takers over come out from those things and take this horn of all and part upon him and tell him you know what you're a different class of people oh yeah what does he tell us there in the first field he's sitting there and he's calling him church and he's calling church and church and church in church and in the first seal he stopped saying i'm not going to call you church i'm going to call you bride amen so that you might understand uh well just what are we to understand we're different right huh that's right we're not better than the church next door only the blood of jesus only the revelation he chose you to know this message that's right listen he didn't choose them maybe to know it yet but he chose you to know and now the responsibility lays in your hands what will you do with this jesus called christ amen and then tell them that they need to lay in the presence of the sun right then they need to ripen because there's going to be another sheath wave in the last day yeah all right all right let's just read this here and it's the rising of the sun the river says and to be waved again we realize in the last day right according to luke 17 the son of day the sunday again and the day when the son of man will be revealed or waved over to people who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen and the word became flesh right right right i didn't say jesus had to go through any certain things to become god no no no all right see it is all the teaching that we have in the confirmation of the word of god by the word of the signs of wonders we see today that in the book of luke they will just quote it wrong and in luke 17 and 30 and malachi 4 and a different scripture that we acquainted with when that that the word again is to be waved over the people that the dead traditions of the traditions of man is dead and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us and giving us life amen amen right yes anything that's got life has got a little bit of emotion right right it's like brother samuel told you this morning just because there's anointing supreme control supreme authority and growth that don't do away with the emotion that don't go away with the moving of the spirit it's like one brother said if i go out to feed my horse or my dog and he don't move i kick him and he still don't move i bury him right cause he's dead and brother brown said if your religion hasn't got a little bit of emotion to it it's dead and it needs to be buried and you need to get a different religion amen i say lord don't let me die lord you keep me on fire for you lord hey every one of us worship in a different way and that's not even what it's what comes from within right how are you worshipped like some people cry some people raise their hand some people shout some people dance some people throw their arms everywhere like me and you're stacked like a nut but i can't help it you can't help the way you worship i can't help the way i preach brother samuel can't help the way he preaches every man's gift is different but god has called a five-fold ministry in this hour to receive the anointed word to give it to the anointed bride to bring on an anointed people ready for a rapture yes father live christ was the first one to raise from raised from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church there will be a sheep wave again in the last day oh my waving of the sheaf what was the sheath the first one to come to mature the first one to prove it was a wheat that proved it was a sheep hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and for the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message glory and the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power we're not waiting for full power to come full power is here no powers in your hands inspire the anointed people and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders he did back there i like this one first paragraph 97 because i live you live also right speaking to his wife amen right exactly right now she's a wife and something had to happen right that's right it had to be a marriage right what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power so he poured it on to them and he put listen if he poured it on to you and he put it into you then it's going to take you from point a to point z and all this stuff in between yeah right is immaterial because god had a plan you meant the plan um you might go up mountains you might hit flat stretches you might come down valleys but god knows beginning to the end and when you're in the valley god don't kick you out that's right right and when you're down god don't kick you out thank you lord oh you have been given an unction john said we have been given an unction from the holy one then i can say it today you have received an unction from the holy spirit in this hour that you understand and for you to see what the word has been made flesh in this name right amen you can understand exactly amen i don't understand all these things in the book of revelation well why not right because they're mysteries they're not mysteries you may go mysteries right oh the mysteries should be revealed right that's right it's like one brother said he said i hate mystery preachers because when you're done there's still a mystery oh my god it wasn't a mystery here's

still clean it buddy that's the way your life was right amen your life was like this exactly when you was born it was innocent it was chris there was nothing against it but when sin began to come your life began to be thrown down in the pirate pits of sin and down there in the sewage tank you were and you didn't have any control of it but one day somebody thought enough about you to come alone and pick you up and give you a word that would change your mind and you can't i'll take that man no he's down in the sewers i'll wash him i'll set him aside for service i'll fill him with the holy ghost right amen that's how much he thinks about you right regardless of what you've been through jesus christ is more than enough glory come back hallelujah thank you jesus christ the word christ means a anointed one the anointed one then moses was christ in his days he was the anointed one jeremiah was christ in his days you see where he's going with that moses was christ in his day jeremiah's christ in his days but when jesus came he was the redeemer anointed one and that was moses and all that was in moses and all the word and all the godhead bodily was in him right amen all right he didn't leave part of it out it was all in him oh now listen all that was in god he poured into christ all that was in christ all right come on where'd he put it at man that's right amen right you see what he thinks of god i'm part of you hallelujah right and he says all that was in the word that god had bothered was a hill that's the reason the whole temple veil was rent and the mercy seat come in plain view in perfect view he was the inaudible man hallelujah so he's now poured into christ right now he's come down through seven church angels and now he comes down into this age and now all that was in god he poured into christ all that was in christ he poured into the church and he was doing it through his angels born it into the body that we might be made one with him glory amen we have the mind of christ we know what he wants done with the word we have supreme power in control amen the word is in your heart you believe in divine healing you believe in whatever else there is right i said there ain't a reason why one of us brother brown said if we can only believe get the faith right we need it right there wouldn't need to be a hospital in five minutes right five minutes we have a brother right now laying in the hospital possible heart attack back home just just just today but i'm telling you he's still the same hitler amen right he can go down in the hospital touch that brother's body and the doctor sit there and i don't know what happened you might have all the symptoms but there ain't no scar there there ain't no damage here we don't know what's going i know what's going on you speak the anointed word of god and god has to back it up all right don't want him to go like that christ the anointing coming to his body see the connection there just like husband and wife right to become one amen now the church has got to get to the ministry until the church in christ become one right he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the bible gloria the program said there were 600 and something promises of divine healing in the new testament of all amen all of it's yours everything is promised at this age is yours amen so the living word is here to live in you to prepare you glory next one brother the resurrection will set in first the resurrection of those that are asleep there will be an awake awakening time those which are sleeping the dust now not those that are sleeping sin because they sleep right on they don't wait for another thousand years but those who are asleep in the dust will be awakened and these corruptable bodies will put on incorruption in the rapturing grace of the lord and then we'll all get together right and when they begin to get together then we would so alive and remain shall be changed these mortal bodies will not see death right hey christ come on my grandpa asked me one time he said when we are changed do we feel any pain did we die just for a split second no he said all right i can't explain it all but i believe it right right they'll not see death right but just a sudden there'll be like a sweet goal for us hallelujah and you're changed you you're turned back like abraham was from an old man to a young man from an old woman to a young woman what's this sudden change and after a while you're traveling like a thought you can see those then there are already resurrected oh what an hour there then we'll gather with them and be caught up to meet the lord in the air hallelujah that's why we're here tonight lord prepare the eagle to be able to meet them in the air the creative voices god will be calling him forth from the dust and that creative voice of god is changing you even now in heaven that's right they didn't change you in huh you better let that voice begin to work on you right the anointing will bring forth what's inside us because brother brother said the rapture is already in you right and he says you know you're like that inexhaustible fountain you're just pushing pushing pushing and pushing water's coming out water's coming out everything you have needed for earthly journey divine healings the power of god is in you all these things is in every individual that's received the baptism of the holy ghost for your planet and christ and then he says don't resent that i wonder who that was yeah he said that's the truth the rapture is in us now i'll prove it to you by the gospel those whom he justified he has already glorified amen hallelujah then have been in heaven today we're glorified he said in the presence of god right now hey it's not that we're going to be someday right now your sons and daughters of god right now you're sitting in heavenly places right now the rapture's in you right glory hallelujah that's just pushing out of it right amen glory god's in his word you believe it amen the prophet received that word poured it upon you riley and now brother brahm says in the church age book the voice of god is in the bride amen for she knows what he wants done in fact with the word right under under the messenger right right not above it right not gonna get greater revelation right hey you'd do good if you even got half of his revelations but god gives us revelation as he can trust us with revelation lord i need more of your anointed word glory i need more of the supernatural anointing but i know it ain't about shouting and dancing and those things are fine but lord i need more supreme power and control i need the anointing so much in my life god that i can cause it can cause this old flesh to be controlled by your spirit and your word and you keep me where you want me at and you give me the things i have need of that's right that's right and when i'm sick i just ask you glory listen churches it's time that we we know god so well that's right that when we get sick we ain't got to pray for six years of repentance right right to get through to god right now well i did this and i did this and i did this listen brother branham tells us somebody come through the prayer line one time they come through the prayer line he looks at him and he says now get all the sin out of your life yeah somebody come through with sin and he said ask god to forgive you and he said repeat this prayer and then give them an eight second prayer eight seconds and then he prayed for him because their sin had been forgiven amen it's not about how long you pray right it's about how much you mean it when you do pray all you have to do is ask your father that's right forgive me god amen or no i didn't mean to do it i i didn't want to be influenced by something else god i i didn't want to go down that direction lord but i wanted you lord to have the preeminence in my life and lord i want to be in harmony with you i want to make sure that my life is dovetailed to this word but i'm not looking listen if your life ain't lined up to the world don't be looking for a body change right that's right do you get this old man right here yes under subjection to the whole side all right baby lord you leave me yes there's a need i know you can grab it there's a sickness he can heal it he's already healed amen right it's finished all we have to do is accept it by faith lord you said it i'm believing it and i ain't turning back on it god i'm resting upon your divine promises you placed it in your word you sent the anointed word in my door i am resting my entire life that's it upon this message right listen and if this i don't believe it is but if it were wrong i'll take my chances with it amen because to speak against the message is to speak against christ right because christ is the message all right amen in fact a lot of people get bold say a lot of crazy things in this hour bring a lot of reproach say lord take me out of here before that happens right i don't want to be a reproach i don't want to say something more that would that would bring reproach upon your word because this word is hell right listen lord and this word is to prepare people i don't even want to be a stone blocker right i want this word to be doctor yeah exactly you bring the message amen glory what do you believe i believe he is the same yesterday today forever it's like the little color man said that time they said boss do you believe what's in that book he said yes sir i believe it from cover to cover and i didn't believe what's on the cover itself he couldn't read a word of it but he believed it right right that's the most important part of it we might not understand everything here but one thing about it we can say i believe it with all of my heart amen i had a brother come to me one minute said probably i don't understand this certain doctrine i said brother bill he didn't ask you to understand it he asked you to believe it right right and if you believe it he'll show it to you he said i believe you keep believing because when god gets ready to show it to you he'll reveal it to you right amen and then what you have to do is then walk in it glory walk in it as god gives you revelation you walk in right there's a lot of things eight years ago i didn't understand a lot of things i don't understand but eight years ago there was a whole bunch of things i didn't understand but as god begin to open it thank you lord right and i'll walk in it right and as he shows me more i will amen and if he shows me more tomorrow i'm going to walk in there and if he shows me more next year i'm going to walk on that right listen our most important goal is not to make some new year resolution but lord you let me get so in love with you god till you change my body this year let this be the year rapture amen amen they do your let the musicians come i feel good enough i can preach the new year when you can catch the word for your day right you're a blessed people amen right he didn't take the seals take it to the catholic church and break it open right and reveal it to him right but he did it to you all right they can see where jesus was born in a manger yeah that was great they can see where he went to calvary and he died and that was great and they could see where he resurrected on the earth morning and that was great but when he stepped forth to take the book of redemption and to release the things that were in there and to release your identity that's greater than his birth greater than his resurrection because without that ill man was lost right right john not knew he not he don't know he resurrection but he also knew if he didn't come and take that milk right there'd be no anointing for this right exactly but he came right away he was the word that went right let's stand together brother let's try 369 in the red book amen okay eternally is is lay your glory in your honor in they wrote those words ago anything anybody is oh i remember the first time i heard the prophet saying god created man did even i preached that he never stayed up there did he come down here to go through life um i don't care what you said you know what i thought about them you can even burn that piece of paper right but you know if you can get those ashes that piece of paper they burn you can take it right down and they can make you a brand new hundred dollar bill out of the money well that's what we are right just a bunch of burned up nothings garbage cans not worth burning he made five is they look like tomorrow once the children of israel went into the promised land foreign every day god oh just hold on is is just remember what you were doing
