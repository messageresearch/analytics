really enjoyed that singing brother Yu you need to put that in on that tape that you're making that was that was real good amen right we're going to have a little bit different service this afternoon because we want to have the ordination service so you can go ahead and be seated and uh you know we just going to have an ordination service for brother Bob we have uh done as the scripture says you know and uh many many of you brothers are qualified for for being a deacon and things and but we chose brother Bob to uh put him into a place to to be able to fulfill the office and be with Terrence and uh Wade in the the being of the deacons of the church and it's a it's an honorable position and a you know and so just uh you know we thank God that we can we can depend on people and their doings in the offices of the church and stuff like that and we just we just appreciate brother Bob in his stand and he's been a a good brother for many years with us and you know so he he fits the bill of what we have need of so if brother Bob would come and if Wade and Terrence and Aaron would come on to minister Brethren and we'll just have a a time of ordinate ordination of our brother as a deacon and then you know we'll go on into the Fulfillment of the service I was just going to read the scriptures now actually in a technical sense a bishop and a deacon has the same qualifications but uh when you deal with the the bishop to going into the ministry you got a you know a part that uh you could do so we will just read the part that's related to doing if you remember the story comes in the book of Acts uh chapter 1 they were having uh problems with daily necessities and The Works around there and the handling of everything is as brother randam called him a a deacon said he's a he's a police officer you know to take care of things and and to try to do and help all of them and and they set aside seven men and they laid hands on them and prayed for them you know and ordained them as uh the first deacons you know for the for the job and uh so then let's just read the scripture if we will here in U act I mean excuse me in 1 Timothy 1 we'll begin reading at verse 8 you can read back up before like I said the bishop and the Deacon is runs together you know but it we'll just read the part of the deacon likewise must the deacons be grave not double tonged not given to much wine not greedy of filthy lucer hold in the mystery of the faith and a pure conscience let these also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless even so must their wives be grave not slanderous sober faithful in all things let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children in their own house well for they that have used the office of a deacon will purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus like I say we believe that brother Bob fits in this and all and we we certainly appreciate him and look forward to working with him and the the Lord and and everything you know and so now you know who he is and you know who the deacons are and they are the policeman and that's not just all of their job but they are the policeman of the church and if something goes wrong and they come and correct you well just remember they're correcting you because of their job if your children does something wrong and one of the deacons gets on to them then you get your feelings hurt you'll have to deal with me because I've always stood with the deacons I know maybe some before might have thought I didn't but I've always stood it doesn't matter whether it's my kids my grandkids my great grandkids my you know my family that has nothing to do with if these deacons correct you you line up and then you say well they didn't have a right to do that will they do because it's their job if they see something going wrong out here you know some problem some little something happening they have the full authority to correct you and like I said if you get your feelings hurt you're going to have to deal with me about it because that's that's the offices to help me to where I don't have to be outside and running things and and doing things and then I can just say to them go take care this and let them handle their job so you respect them and you pray for them because that's that's their job and that's the the part that they need to to be and we just we appreciate brother Bob and we'll just just go ahead and the prophet I've read up a good bit on you know over the years of of the ordaining and things and and it's simply just like any other we we lay hands on him to show our part of love one to the other all right and showing that we you know fully respect him for the job and all and believe that he is the one and we just ordain him to be into that position and then to walk there in and that's a great reward you know there's a great reward that goes with it sometimes as I said you may have to correct you know you may have to do something that you wouldn't want to do but just remember you're doing it for the Lord and the work in his church all right father we thank you for our brother we thank you that he has father made what we believe is the qualifications of this office of a deacon and we just agree here with the ministry of the church and the deacons and all and we agree Lord that our brother is Honorable respected and Lord he fits the place that we have a need of we ask you now that you would just be with him Lord and give him the the right attitude and the right Spirit of all things that he Lord may be able to fulfill his job and Lord help us to honor that that no matter if he was to correct me Lord let me stand the correction and let us all line up to walk in you because that's what we're ordaining offices for and and things that we may Lord be right in order of the word and following after what you said we just lay our hands upon our brothers showing the congregation that we agree with him and he set aside for this office and Lord that he's the Deacon of the Lord in Jesus name amen amen amen God bless you brother God bless let's stand together we appreciate our brother and I'm sure he'll do the work amen now what we're going to do we're going to play the message because the other day my wife and I were sitting there and uh listening to this message and uh you know that's what we do we uh we kind of developed you know a thing of where we we have a good bit of time together and I enjoy that cuz you know we do spend a lot of time together we spend all day and then all night and and we'll be sitting there and listening to tapes and and you know doing things together and uh we were just listening to this and on communion and uh because that's what I do a lot of times I'll just I won't decide which to play I just sit in the machine and play and and this was the life service the prophet preached and it tells a lot about the communion all right and it tells a lot about those that are qualified to take communion all right so you listen to him as he explains it to you but then there's a lot said now this will be further into the message that I'm going to be trying to bring on predestination all right and then we will be bringing in trying to see that our thoughts line up with what he says now some of the things he said on this says on this message they're pretty hard to understand and it's going to take a while maybe to you know get in the right attitude and the right things about it and we we you know to the people on the internet maybe some people out there are click on that uh today that uh maybe he's never heard brother brandom you know and maybe they've never do it it but it's wonderful that brother Joe and brother Richard and them came up and fixed it and it's through the life system that we purchase from uh voice of God Recordings to help us you know to do and that way we can play the tape and actually read it on the screen and it'll scroll right on and do and you can read and follow along and read with the prophet it's not very long so we just decided to do it this afternoon and to have the ordination and everything else and you you tell brother Bob that you'll back him up amen you pray for him you pray for these deacons cuz they got their job to do you know so you pray for him and pray the Lord would help them all right so let's just go ahead if you want to let's pray and then we'll be seated and then brother Joe and him Brother Richard and him can get everything to go into where we can can view the whole thing and and listen to it all right father we thank you we love you we ask you now that you would just be with us as we listen to the prophet that he's speaking and may we see the qualifications of what it is to be able to take the communion and Lord and then maybe we can see where we are in you and we thank you for the ability that man has made that we were able to receive these messages and all and we pray you would just bless us now as we read and and listen to your prophet in Jesus name amen you may be seated per gave us this thing from the word of God how true it is that we limit God and time God and he Eternal we can't do that so tonight we're facing something else now is a communion 3 years I waited for a church to come in two son but it's here we're we're here so we thank the Lord he just let us wait you we can appreciate it now I one thing that I want to say just before we start the communion is this that I believe that we have seen enough in our day that we live in that we ought to really give every all of our being to God we we should really serve God I believe that he has blessed us with the direct uh answer to scripture as brother Perry gave it a few moments ago that we we are we're at that time we're not blind we we we see that we're here we we've arrived and we also can look around and see that the way that the human mind is leading the people that we we can't stay too much longer we'd been in a complete insane institution the whole world would be see so we we're at the end time now as brother Perry ended up there seeing these things are true see that they are true they're not myth they're not just something that we imagine there's something that's been directly given to us by the word of God and manifested publicly before us that we know we are here we we don't know how long now because again we come back to a watch you see what time it is but we we know we we here we at the time whether God's time I'd imagine someone give a little analysis one time that said that if God put up with him U according if he was a lot time one 1,000 years is just one day so if a man lived 70 years old it just be a few minutes of God's time well it said to be 40 years that would even meantime hard could bad di see just that's how quick it is the whole whole thing is if it be L time which he doesn't have any time so he just Eternal I believe it was Sarah back know Joseph the other night said to me brother Perry said daddy where when did God come on the scene where did he come from see he had to have a beginning didn't he didn't he have to start I said no anything that has a beginning has an end right but it's that which had not a beginning has no end of course he's 10 years old that was kind of a real mouthful for him that how could he receive that knowing that something never did begin not only to him it is to me see it's a great big dose for me how did it ever begin now we're fixing to observe something here that's really sacred I was called on a few days ago to some very fine Christian gentleman that U that's never had this and he understood that we taking communion literally they take it what they call spiritual communion and uh which as far as communion I'd say all right because communicate is to talk to see and the brother again the scripture said brother B don't you think now reason I'm saying this is sorry that reason I'm saying this so that you would understand what you're doing you don't if you're walking in Ain blindly you don't know what you're doing you can't have even in if you don't know what you're doing but you must understand what you are doing and why you're doing it he said now if we take the word of God isn't that God that we're taking I said exactly right sir it's true but we read here that they actually Paul taught taking the literal Lord's Supper this do in remembrance of me said Jesus as often as you take it in remembrance of me you show forth the Lord's death till he come now we are to take it we understand that St Paul who ordained in the church being the prophet of the New Testament Peter James John all of them they wrote Matthew Mark Luke what Jesus did as scribes but Paul set the thing in order he was a he was the prophet of the New Testament just as Moses went into the Wilderness to receive the inspiration to write the the five books of uh of the first five books of the Bible Well Paul also went into the desert and received inspiration from God to set the New Testament Church in order and TI it with the old under there they had a sacrificial lamb and Israel kept that for a memorial it was actually used one time coming out of Egypt but then they kept that as a memorial all down to the age well the law being a shadow of things to come you see now I do believe that communion or what we call communion now is the is the Lord's supper now we only have three physical Divine orders left to us one of them is is communion feet washing water baptism that's the only three things that's the Perfection of the three that's the only three orders we have we realize that that was the issue given by St Paul in the New Testament now if we would say the communion should just be taken the word I don't believe anyone has a right to take the Lord's Supper until he's taken the the word of the Lord into his heart see because I'm I'll read something for you in a few moments and you'll see now notice then why then we we we would on the same basis we could absolutely justify the Salvation Army they do not believe in any form of water baptism that we don't need it now if we don't need water baptism why are we baptized so well water can't save you the blood saves you I'll agree with that amen that's right the blood saves you not the water but we must take the water as an outward emotion that a inward work of Grace has been done so must we own communion when we have taken the Lord our sacrifice into us as a matter of spiritual birth into us and his body we live by him by the word we also should symbolize it because it's a commandment repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins Paul said I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night which he betrayed took bread and break it and gave it to the disciples and and said Take and Eat This do uh in remembrance of me for as often as you take this bread you show forth his death till he comes now we find out that in that they had people who come and this precious brother very dear brother he came and he said I never I never did take it brother BR I don't understand what it is I've been taught the other side I said but remember we will admit that St Paul set it in order in the early Christian Church they went from church from house to house broke the bread single to the heart and so forth now I said he did put it in the church Galatians 1:8 he said if an angel from heaven comes and says anything else let it be a curse see amen the same one happens to be rebap tized again from the uh baptism of John to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you see there are three things that we must three things that we must do as symbol Lord supper de portion water baptism see there's he said well the now the uh Salvation Army takes it from the point of dying Thief when he died he wasn't baptized yet Jesus said he'd be in heaven that's exactly the truth that's exactly but you see he he he only recognized Jesus right there in the hour he was dying see that's only that's the only opportunity he had he's a Thief His a away he's out and he as soon as he seen that life he recognized it Lord remember me and Jesus that was true but to you and I who know that we should B be baptized and refuse to do it then that'll be between you and God Amen same thing in communion now when we take this communion it isn't just the things that have come up here go to eat some bread and I believe I'm a Christian but if you notice the Bible said he that eateth and drinketh unworthily shall be guilty of the blood and the body of the Lord you've got to live a life that that before the people that and before God and the people that shows that you are you are sincere just a moment longer now in the Old Testament when the sacrifice was made a statue or an ordinance and so is water baptism an ordinance so is feet woring an ordinance amen so is the Lord's Supper an ordinance amen blessed is he does all of his ordinance keeps all of his statutes all of his Commandments that he might have have a right to enter into the tree of life now notice in this now that in that first when it was first an ordinance of God to bring a sacrifice to the church and to the temple and the Altar and offer your gift and uh for your sins the sacrifice of a lamb or I can just imagine seeing some Jewish brother coming down the road knowing he was guilty and he goes to the altar brings his fat Ox a book or or whatever he had a ram lamb something he brought it down the road just as sincere as he could come he walked up there keeping God's ordinance just as sincerely as he could then he laid his hands up on it confessing his sins the priest placing this his sins upon the lamb and the Lamb's throat was cut and U and then died for him he laid there the little lamb kicking and bleeding his hands been full of blood and flying all over him the little lamb blatant dying he would realize that he had sinned and something had to die in his place therefore he was offering this Lamb's death for his death the lamb died in his place then a man done it with sincerity with deepness of his heart finally over and over it went again over and over it kept going until finally it become a tradition the Commandment of God became a tradition to the people and then you come out well let's see this a sword maybe I better go yeah I better offer he went out well Lord here's my B see there's no sincerity in it there's no understanding to it now we don't want to take communion like that that's the same thing as to come to the Lord's table I say uh 35 no I beg your pardon Isaiah 6 let me take that back I I I believe it's Isaiah 28 is where we find this I'm pretty sure that's the right chapter he said precept must be upon precept and line upon line upon line here a little there little hold fast in that what's good for stammer lips other tongues will I speak to this people and this is the rest he said all the tables of the Lord has become full of vomit who can I teach doct who can I make understand see I think that was the right scripture isah TW who can I make understand Doctrine see the tables now we find out today that this great thing that we're fixing to do tonight in commemoration of his death and his body that we believe that we eat daily or just got through eating as our brother preached to us taking the word of God we believe it with all of our heart we see it manifested we see it given us we see it Vindicated we feel it in our lives and we must come to this with a deep conscience of what we're doing not just because it's an order you go into church and many times they get out an old so cracker or some kind of a something bring it up and light bread or something and and break it up and people who smoke drink everything else because they're a member of the church they come and take the Lord's Supper well that's healthiness before God even the sacrifice that your holy days and your sacrifice become a stanum my no yet he ordained them to make that sacrifice but the way they treated it it become a stun stink in his nose his nostril the very sacrifice that he ordained that's right that's the way we take the word of God too many Christians today so call does that we stand up here and teach this word and say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and teach the things that he promised us that he would honor and say was for something else our Sodom worships it become a stink in his nose he will not receive it by no means that's Reason by our traditional habits you don't take the Lord's Supper by tradition you take it because it's the love of God in your heart you're keeping the Commandments of God see that's what you take it for so if you don't take it in s just it's a tradition well our church observes communion once every Sunday or once every month or twice a year and you go up say well it's my time take the communion why it's a stink to God see that's just a tradition even like anything else you you've got to be sincere God wants the depths of your heart you remember the very God that brought you here on Earth is the one you're serving you're doing this because he said so because it's his order then we want to give up with deepness sincerity knowing that by God's grace that we have been saved and we we love him and we he his presence and we we sit uh change our lives our our whole being is changed we we we're different people we don't live like we used to we don't think like we used to like in the book here and um a spot there was talk about the the two books being one The Book of Life The First Book of Life coming up was one you were born that was your natural birth but then one time way back down in there there was a little grain of life as I was explained to some of the young sisters at the house this afternoon see there's a little grain of life in there that you'd wonder where did it come from what what these strange things a saying is taken for a like he going to say William Brandon well 40 years ago the William Brandon this is the same one tonight somebody back there say he was a rank Rascal because I was born of Charles and El bran in that nature I was a sinner I came to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there je was another nature present predestinated is in there there by God in this same body two Natures in there well I only cater to one is it grow I good as the Baby D ey for thinging or become a liar become everything else that's a sinner because I raised up that way but down in there was a little speck of Life all the time I used to remember as a little boy I hope I'm not holding you too long but going uh sitting out in the on the creek Bank i' sit there and look around at night time Mom they're going on after to their rest and them days they were Sinners there's no Christianity in our homes at all all my drinking and parties and carrying on it made me sick I take my my Rainer and my dog and go up the woods to stay all night in the winter time I'd hunt cuz the party was over maybe daylight in the morning come home with be over i' lay on top of a shed and sleep waiting for daylight to break then i' think of uh how the times then being out there in the summertime get my sticks and put it down for a little wind break or if it rain L I have a pole sticking in the water fishing my old crew dog laying there I said look at here you know last winter I camped right here one night I build a fire right here when I was waiting for my old dog here to tree and uh I had a fire here it was froze 5 in deep in the ground but little fire where did you come from where did you come from Who come out here and planted you and what hot house did they bring you out of or what where'd you come from see that little fire while it was frozen everything and I build a fire on top here besides the freezing element there was a heat element there you're on a big old wild and yet here you are to your Al where' you come from what was it there was another William R okay A little spot of eternal life down there from the the the jeans of God the word of God that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar thing it was working now look up the trees I think Lee I seen you fall off last year and why you back there again where' you come from what brought you here see it was that eternal life working in the body now then one day as I walked on that voice talking don't never smoke drink so forth the young fellas I got older see there was something moving but yet all that once I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles and El brand there's something call like no illegal I'm not a chicken there something up y somewhere Jehovah whoever you are open up I want to come home there's something in me calling then I was born again that little life was say there the life of water was poured upon on it and it begin to grow now that old life was forgiven but in the sea of God's forgiveness to Never Be Remembered against me no more amen see now we stand Justified as though we never had sin in the presence of God then when we come to the Lord's table we must come in reverence love and respect of look where we would have been if it hadn't been for him look where would therefore Paul I think in s wherefor when you come together to eat hairy one for the other that is other words just wait a few minutes pray check yourself out and if you know a brother's in there just about to do something that's wrong or something uh and you pray for him too see carry one the other wait just a minute pray there's any feelings between you or something don't don't do don't do it go make that right first see go straighten that up first because you want to come here just as cure as we can be in our thoughts of one another and to God and to each other and then we come in Fellowship around the table of the Lord see and we do this because that we are giving thanks to him and among one another eating of bread between each other drinking the wine between you as his blood and his flesh except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you see you see that's what the Bible say except you do it there's no life you see you are then more or less showing you are ashamed to identify yourself as a Christian because of the life that you live and then this is really The Showdown then if you don't do it you have no life if you do do it unworthily you're guilty of the body of the Lord same thing in water baptism if we say we believe on Jesus Christ he saved us from sin and we're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ while we bring we bring disgrace to him we do the things that's wrong and we we have to pay for that and another thing thing when we do that we are trying to profess one thing and do another that's the trouble of us today but I think I'm saying us me and the church that the Lord God has let me speak to in these last hours that we believe we're in the closing time we believe that God has GI us a message amen it's been ordained of God it's been proven of God it's been short of God now we must come to him with reverence and with love and with with purity of heart and mind and soul you know the hour sise when when right Among Us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did in anth and Sur amen see that hour is arriving am see and we are now you just remember that see the God is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now we can receive the message and saying if I was a young man and hunting for a wife and I could find a wife I said she's just perfect she's a Christian she's a lady she's all this I Got Confidence no matter how much confidence how much I think she's life I've got to receive her she's got to receive me see upon these vows that's the same thing we find is the message we see it's right we see God vindicates it's right is perfectly right year after year year after year continues right continues right everything it says happens just exactly the way he said now we know it's right but see don't do it from an intellectual standpoint if you do you got a second-handed religion we don't want a second-handed religion something that somebody else has experienced and we are living off of of their testimony as I believe it was Jesus said to Pilot uh uh something a word I was thinking he said there just a few moments ago uh who told you that or was it revealed to you how did you know these things in other words I don't know what the word is now it's been a long time since read but how did you how did you know this how who reveal this to you about him being the Son of God who reveal it to you did some man tell you that or as Jesus said is it my Father in Heaven which has revealed it to you see how did you learn it a second hand or is it a perfect Revelation from God is this communion just something I go up for an order say well the rest of take yes I will to it's a revelation that I have part of him and I'm part of you and I love you and I love him and we're taking this together as a symbol of of our love to God and our love and fellowship to one another now I I want to read some from the scripture and then I guess whichever way brother Perry desires today I wish You' read it with me if you got your Bible First Corinthians the U the 11th chapter and begin with the 23rd verse and then also at our Tabernacle we've always observed this and feet washing always because they go hand in hand together I believe the brother announced it Wednesday night because of the crowds and you don't have enough to uh room to get the people in for feet washing go obser observe this Wednesday night now 23rd verse of the 11th chapter of First Corinthians listen to Paul now now remember keep this in mind Galatians 1:8 if we are an angel from heaven preaches any other gospel unto you than this gospel that he preached let him be con curse for I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when you gave thanks he break it said Take and Eat This is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me now let me stop right here to say but taking the body of the Lord Jesus Christ in this communion does not mean that that communion is the literal Body of Christ that's Catholic right I do not believe and that's right I believe it's only an ordinance that God made with that's right it isn't an actual body it's not it's really a little piece of kosher bread that's right it's just an ordinance neither do I believe that the baptism of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ and water does forgive your sins I do not believe that I believe you can be baptized all day long now I know that there's perhaps people sitting here who come from the apostolic church I mean the United Pentecostal Church which they teach that but you see I I do not believe that the water forgives sins or if it was than Jesus died in vain see I believe it it's only an ordinance of God see to show that you have been forgiven but to be baptized for regeneration no I I I don't believe I don't believe that water forgives sins NE I believe that this bread and and wine has anything to do with you only keeping an ordinance that God has ordained for us to do see after I be water baptism is the same thing I be it's compelling to us to do it that he done it all for our example and he done this for our example and he washed feet for our example now after the same manner also 25th verse after the same manner also he tooked the cup and when he had sin this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as off as you drink it in remembrance of me for as off remember now for as off as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh forth the Lord's death till he comes H until he comes amen amen wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord let me stop just a minute the reason he said this you notice in another verse here another chapter that he said I understand when you when you come together you're eating even getting drunk at the Lord's table they missunderstood it you see they just fluted in see just like people are doing today just live any kind of life I can take it see he said you got homes to eatting see but this is an ordinance that we should keep see now but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the right and drink of the cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body what are you you're a Christian amen you live before everybody as a Christian and if you take that and don't live as a Christian you're not Discerning the Lord's body you're put the stum Rock in somebody else's way see as they see you trying to do that and they're not living what you're supposed to live see you're not Discerning the Lord's body now watch what what the curse of it is for this caus many are weak and sickly among you and many are sleep the right translation that word brother per is dead right many of for if we for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged that's right we judge ourselves we will be judged but when we are judged we're Chas of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world see not any attached to the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for the other see and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest I will set in order when I come see now in other words don't just come to take it as a as I said a while ago about what the Jews their sacrifice they it was wonderful it's given by God but it got to a place where they didn't do it in sincerity and reverence and in order then it become just a it become a stench in his nose now the same thing is but our coming to take the Lord's Supper amen that we must come knowing what we are doing just like when you go into the water to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you know what you're doing you're putting on to the church what God has put in you Christ when we take this it shows to the church that I believe every word of God I believe that he is the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven I believe every word that he says is the truth and I'll live by to the best of my knowledge God being my judge therefore before my brothers before my sisters I I do not swear I do not curse I do not do these things because I love the Lord and the Lord knows that bears me record therefore before you I take the partial of his body to know that I'm not condemned with the world see there you are then it's a blessing and remember I could give many testimonies on this where I've took that and explained it in a sick room that's right and seen him heal that's right remember when Israel taken the type of this they journeyed 40 years in the wilderness and their clothes never even wore out and they come out without one feeble among one among them with two million people as type of this or what would the antitype do if the body of a sacrificial animal did that for them what would the body of Jesus Christ Emmanuel do for us let's St be R when we come let us be just as rent as we know how to come can you say amen amen appreciate that appreciate hearing what the prophet had to say about the the communion and things right so let's just stand together he read the scriptures all we'll do is just the brothers will bring it forth and we will just uh pray over the the food and you know the bread and and just bread and the wine and we'll go right on into it but take the heart and go and listen to the things you know that is there and hear what the prophet had to say it's over for Overcomers not for somebody just out living in the world and just doing all kind of things doing so you consider your own self the Bible says to examine yourself to see whether you're in the faith or not to examine your yourself and then you know consider that for your own self all right let's just pray and just have a few moments of Silent prayer as it says you know praying one for the other before we go on into the communion service in Jesus name the Bible said that he took bread and blessed Him Father we thank you for this bread it's been made for this one purpose this afternoon for us to take it as a memorial unto you for what you've done for us and to show as Israel was leaving out of Egypt they took these things and here we are Lord rejoicing in you and knowing that you've made all things well we ask you now that you would just Lord come down and sanctify this bread and sanctify the partakers that we may all be one together in you forgive our sins and lead us Lord we know this is not your body but we know that it represents it and like the prophet has said even in the explaining of these things he said he'd seen people healed Lord we thank you for your word sanctify the food and the partakers in Jesus name you know we always think about Israel and their journey and things when they were coming out they were getting ready to leave you know we were to be getting ready to leave out of here it's getting to be a pretty bad time we're not people who uh run about you know getting wings going up on the hill sit down and say the Lord's here no we're not of that form those people were deceived we're not that we are people of the light we know that we keep going and we don't know how long it'll be like the prophet was saying those things there that we're ready is here and that was 1965 right what about now how much closer are we to the finishing up of all things we're not going to just throw up our hands and go back home and sit down and and just say well you know it's all over we don't have no hopes no we keep going until the Lord com CU that's what he said about the communion do this till I come father we thank you for this wine that's went through this process and now Lord it gets greater each day and we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we know that this wine is not your blood no more than the bread being your body but it's in representation of Thy word being the bread of life and now the quickening of the wine Lord is to stimulation of Revelation into our hearts to make that word that we have alive in our in our beings because we'll eat the little piece of bread we'll drink the little bit of wine and Lord tomorrow that'll make blood cells in our body that we can live thereby so we thank you for all things and the truth of it we committ it all to you now we ask you to sanctify the wine and the partakers in Jesus name amen come morning iiv I rest me the everen tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight morning sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how then I take one calary it gives me the strength Come Morning by the riv I'll the Green Tree I'll car my through the mid morning glor come morning I by the river will the I carry my cross through the midnight morning there glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question then I take one more look at M calary right and it gives me the strength to go come morning I by the river I the my cross through the midnight morning there's Glory you know the next thing we do when we leave out of here yes be the communion one amen we step over on the other side marriage supper be the communion what a wonderful time what a wonderful opportunity to be able to just think about these things we make them as he said just a well it's an ordinance that we're required to do it's not something we're required to do true it is a requirement but it's an honor am it's an honor it's a respect it's thinking about what he done for us and then when we step over we'll realize all that won't we amen let's all partake together you can be seated we turn in our scripture read and going into the foot washing John 13: 2 and suffer being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Hisar Simon son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord must thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter Sith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered to him if I wash thee not thou H has no part with me Simon Peter Sith unto him Lord not my feet only me but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is worse needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean I just think about it he knew but he went ahead and washed judas's feet he didn't bypass him and you know no he went ahead and washed his feet and he didn't get down and splash the water on and do any different than he did any of the others he simply washed his feet just like he did all the others and it was a finished thing with him so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are you if you do them let's stand together and we'll pray and our sisters can go downstairs for the for the foot washing we appreciate everything and just thought we'd do that today and give you a little little bit about knowing what it is we thank God for the ability to be able to read this the things and the screens and and if you get that program from them you can actually do it with your computer at home and read the the things and up and down and doing it you know and and that's good to some people it likes to do uh you know I've got where that I I I love to listen to tapes and that's just part of my do and I guess I've done it through deer

time and thank you for the fact that we could actually Lord just set am am and just set there and listen and read what your Prophet would say unto us what a great opportunity of the Scientific Technology of mankind and Lord we thank you we ask you now that you would just let that be quickened into our heart that it wouldn't be just as he said a just an ordinance that we're going to take
