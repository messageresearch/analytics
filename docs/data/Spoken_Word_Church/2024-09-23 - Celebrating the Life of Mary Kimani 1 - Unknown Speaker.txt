beautiful Heaven Must Be You know this this world according to James 4:14 say where is you know that what shall be on Tom tomorrow what is your life it is even a vapor that appeared for a little time and then vanishes away amen amen but folks let me tell you something if that's the only hope we have we're most men most miserable as Paul say we have only hope in this life amen we're in trouble but you got to prepare on this side to get to that side that's right amen you got to prepare right now to get to that cuz whatever you are here you're going to be there oh yeah you're not going to change over there you got to change here we saw Sister Mary do that we saw her change oh yeah she had her problem she had her trial she had her tribulations but all of us do that's right we have our own demons to fight every day of our life but she fought amen the word Mary means bravery and devotion and Beloved the word Mary means bravery and devotion and beloved what a wonderful uh smile I told him in there I I just don't think that that that smile can be ever be duplicated by a human being on this side that's right she just had a smile that would just take you in and Captivate you and and you had to listen to her somebody say amen amen you had to listen to her you just had to she made sure you did amen she was just she was just that way right he was just that way listen the good things we sit here to talk about the bad things we like I said we're all in trouble right but the good things in life is what we want to remember her by amen amen I do not think that the devil had anything to do with this I think it was God Amen God Only Takes a life Satan never takes a life he has to give permission if he even wants to mess with you come on somebody that's right okay so this is this is what God decided to do and and I know if you've heard me enough preaching you know one thing for sure I tell you every service God don't make a mistake he can't make a mistake there's no way he can make a mistake every move he makes is perfect we just look at it sometimes in the in the time element that we're in brother Tony we look at it and go yes oh I don't know if I do that or not you know what you're not God Amen that's true God's mind's way above ours his thoughts are way above ours the way I look at it is is that that if if you're settled with God now listen if you're settled with God if you if you're born again Christian if you settled with God then we should be rejoicing as the Bible says the Bible tells us to Rejoice at the death of a saint and to cry when a baby's born we got that totally opposite now we go to the we go to the hospital and we just oh these beautiful baby that baby's born and if God don't do something that baby's born to die and without a conversion on this side that baby's going to just go to a place that we're not even going to talk about cuz I'll promise you folks you believe or not you people sitting here there's a hell and there's a devil and there's a judgment and you will go to one or the other there's not a gray area there's not somewhere you can just float along and do what you want to do no noise God sent his son to die to bring you eternal life that's right amen and an afterlife it's not a hope brother Austin it's not a hope I don't that word hope gets you to Faith right but we got to have faith I'm not hoping I'm going to make no I'm not going to hope I'm going to say it for assurity amen that if you're born again today you're going to make it because God told us he sent his only son to die for you to give you eternal life amen and Sister Mary it was just a privilege for us to to um immers her in in in water baptism and the only way to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen father's not a name son's not a name Jesus told us to do that he told us to baptize the name of the father something but father is not a name Peter on the day of Pentecost said exactly what Jesus said he said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin she took that we put her in the water and she went to a watery grave and came back up a new person amen oh yeah still had her problems still had her issues but you know there was a woman one time I'll be quick there was a woman one time that she was having a bad time in life life she had been probably kicked out by her family she was not doing very well she'd been kicked out on the street maybe maybe unloved and she took on a job that was very lowly she heard one time where Jesus was going to be she heard one time where Jesus was going to be and she didn't run any other direction she prepared and went to Simon's houseen that's where Jesus was something drew her even in the sin that she was in the all the things she had done in her life she wanted to see Jesus she didn't want to just see Jesus she wanted to wash his feet that's right and uh and the uh and her name was Mary by the way if you don't know that okay prise amen but she walks in and all the high and mighty they're like if he's a prophet he should know who this woman is she's unclean she's in sin right right it didn't stop her though she had a little box of O and back then they didn't have screw tops and plastic no it was Clay and when they put the ointment in they sealed it the only way to get it out was to break the Box come on that was the only way they was no screw Caps or squirt bottle back then sorry about that it was in a pot and that pot was sealed with ointment and she goes to Jesus and she doesn't say a word Jesus starts doing what she in her heart amen thought to do she said if I just want to wash this man's feet there's something about him that's different yes and poor old Simon he's over there in the corner and he's looking at her and he's looking at Jesus and what did Jesus do he turned and looked he said Simon he didn't say I have somewhat against her no he said I have somewhat against you you're sitting over there grumbling about this woman washing my feet and you didn't wash my feet you supposed to be the religious person in this brain you didn't wash my feet you didn't greet me to this woman since she's been here all she's done is kissed my feet oh right but while she was there brother Tony there was something miraculous she didn't not only want to adore This Man Called Jesus but she wanted to anoint him most expensive spikenard ointment but you couldn't smell it everywhere you couldn't smell it amen that's right until the box was broke amen until the clay was broke broke yes you couldn't smell the oint but when that but when she broke that point when you broke that Clay Pot the ointment just filled the room and I'm sure Jesus told him he say look said thou givest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment amen amen wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are still there no he didn't say that wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she love much but to whom little is Forgiven the same loveth little yes and he said unto her Mar thy sins are forgiven for am amen amen praise the Lord and they that said at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also didn't bother Jesus didn't bother Mary and he said to the woman thy faith has saved the go in peace amen amen amen thy faith has saved thee going PE you know what happened thank you Lord that ointment didn't go away thank you Lord that ointment was in that room and po Simon he was condemned every time he walked in that room because there was that ointment again amen the anointing oil that Mary put on us right amen sure he put it she put it on Jesus that day she gave her heart to the Lord but she gave it to us and the odor word of smell is not bad it's it's wonderful amen remember her for the wonderful things forget about the bad things listen she's not she didn't take them with her amen they stay right here they stay right here we're just going to take this box that one thought to break thank you for gra thank you for amen you got that right thank you for the Box the box that God decided to break amen and take that Spirit home take that soul home M we're putting this in the ground we're just going to hide it away listen to what job said for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down then it will Sprout again and that the tender the tender Branch thereof will not cease though the root thereof waxs old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of water amen through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth bowels like a plant but man Di and wasteth away yeah man giveth up the ghost where is he job he's acquainted with this all right all the children have died he lost everything he's got yeah right if you think you've had a bad day read the book of job right you never had that in your life that's right you never lost seven kids at one whack and every all your possessions sorry that's right get over your pity party right amen and listen God is the one that took the attention of Satan and said hey have you considered my servant Jo right amen have you considered my servant Mary have you considered my servant Tony sir boy have you considered my servant God wants to absolutely put you out on the stage and though you think you have failed miserably right job thought he had failed miserably but what happened in the end he persevered he stayed true and this is what he said Thank You Jesus so man lith down and riseth not till the heavens be no more oh yes they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep then job get gets a little inspiration he gets a little smell of that ointment he said all that thou would is hide me in the grave amen it's not a bad thing folks she ain't got to go through another Monday she ain't got to go to work pay no taxes her hip's not hurting why are we say right she's moved over into the Eternal oh that thou would hide me in the grave that thou wouldest keep me secret uhhuh until thy wrath be passed yes that thou would us appoint me listen to this appoint me a set time and remember me amen don't forget me God Amen I may go in the grave I may go away I may go out of this Dimension but don't forget me Lord hallelujah if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change comes you'll never see aen 38y old girl no more right amen you'll never see her with a cane you'll never see her walking like she's hurting you'll never see that again that's right oh don't be sad that's right if you're a Christian today don't be sad if you're not a Christian today iure you in the name of the Lord don't go don't you go to sleep until you find this Jesus that Mary put the ointment on Amen listen to this now listen if he would have left it there we'd have been in trouble if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change Come Thou shalt call what what a revelation Jo Thou shalt call and I will answer thee thou will have a desire to the work of thine hands the day of the Resurrection guess what's going to happen the hand of God is going to resurrect this body amen change it yes M oh we don't believe in Thessalonian oh yeah we believe in thalon amen we'll read that at the grave side Lord with thou shall call and I will answer Thee the only reason that job knows that when God calls and he answers is he knew the voice of God that's right amen and the voice of God is now where in The Bride of Jesus Christ the Ministers of this world the Ministers of this country preaching the gospel to you getting you to see not them but get you to see Jesus amen get you to see this guy that died for all of us oh amen right in closing second Timothy 4:7 says I've fought a good fight she fought two Wars and a war within herself but so we all amen I have fought a good fight I finished my course am I've kept the faith hence forth is laid up for me a crown of righteousness yes which the Lord not you judging uhhuh amen which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day amen and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearance you got to know him on this side if you know him on this side when he come to get you he's not going to be a stranger God's not going to be a stranger he's coming you're going to hear that voice the same voice that called you and said hey you're a sinner I died for you I love you more than anybody on this Earth loves you oh our love for family is fine but nobody loves like God loves nobody has the agape love which has no strings attached like I tell the church if God ever loved you remember he can't change his mind amen if he ever loved you he can't un love you don't ever have a day where you say God where are you have you forgotten me do you not love me he can't change his mind if he loves you in the beginning he's got to love you in the end amen can I change his mind amen just make sure that you know that voice make sure you know that person but today let's remember Mary as that ointment the good things the wonderful thing that smile that would absolutely Captivate the whole room with that smile you know what that smile will never have a wrinkle on it again it'll be so beautiful young but take these words put them in your heart God loves you amen amen God doesn't want to leave you alone he said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you amen but he knows his children his children know him amen that's right amen thy faith has saved thee go in peace amen amen let's bow dear heavenly father thank you

one thing I remember about Sister Mary um she love to give testimonies in church yeah amen she would sometimes just Express the way life is some of the trouble she's going through right but one thing I do remember is she was always grateful she had a um what they call a attitude of gratitude and that's something that's deeply within every chrisan um that has experienced God in their life and we should have that confession of Faith amen and so we're going to sing this uh song this morning um so much to thank him for amen if you have a lot in your life to be thankful for your hands we all do even if it's are thankful for the good the bad is who we are and why God has put us here and we should always and there's a key of faith in that that I've realize through my life whatever you have need for start thinking good for it when people would come up and and get prayed for in brother Bam's meetings um the symptoms were there but he would say go thank him for it a confession of faith of calling that which is not as though it is there just a power in the spoken word and every believer has that is what you believe and how you speak it and walk in that confession amen when I look around see the good things oh he's done for me I you Lord I'm not worthy [Music] of and His blessings be free I I my life to him I got so much to can you this morning and i' got so much to thank you so much

we're not supposed to be there till like 130 orish so we have got a little bit of time uh usually at this time at at a gravide real close by they would take the body out but we're just going to leave her here for a little while and then we have an hour left family and the ones of you that are going to the funeral home there's there's bag lunches Cemetery to the cemetery sorry to the cemetery I

stand to our feet I want to really thank everybody for coming and as brother Joe said Mary has got a testimony and she always liked to tell the testimony she enjoyed life you say she waited too late no she didn't God did I ever think God didn't make a mistake say that thought I had a different crowd here God don't make a mistake never change his mind he birthed her when he was supposed to and he took her home when he was supposed to we don't question God job he questioned himself more than he questioned anything else he was questioning himself on that but he knew though when he stood one day and something struck his heart sister Alicia he said I know my redeemer living amen I know I didn't think I didn't hope I didn't get it from the neighbor I didn't even get it from the preacher it was a personal relationship that he had with God he said I know my redeemer live amen and in the last days what will I do I'll stand right here and I'll declare his glory every day it doesn't matter if God takes us all home we're still going to stand right here and declare his glory until we get on the other side and then as the old saying is Katie bar the door it's going to be a shouting time it's going to be a party it's going to be you never in this life friends if you ever think that you can do it with drugs and alcohol and all these different things in this life sorry for you right it has an end what we're talking about today does not have an end right it's God and he changes not amen he's a good God don't blame God God knew what he was doing before the found of the world Amen family God bless you you've been through a hard time you've been through struggles the past year or so but I'm telling you if you don't bind together Satan's going to be right in the middle of it I'm telling you we got to all throw away our differences we got to all throw away our ideas amen Christians has one idea and that's God's idea what the scripture says to bind closer together not separate bind closer together when these things happen but if you don't if there's a crack you know who's going to fit that crack the devil's always going to fit that crack but if you'll Shin it up bind it up compact it Paul said compact that thing together to where Satan can't get involved right God bless you we're going to pray here thanks again family we appreciate you we love you with the love of the Lord thank you for letting Sister Mary be a part of our life and we sure appreciate her will miss her absolutely no doubt but God gained a flower yes God gained a flower amen we're just going to remember with the good memories that we have we're going to commit this body in a little while back to the Earth where it came from but don't be sad that's right amen don't be sad this is not the End Amen this is just her beginning amen this is what she lived her last part of her life for give her life to the Lord Jesus he took her home amen he knew the best that's right he's always the best blessed by our heads dear heavenly father Lord I know that even though we say words it does not come close to the sorrow that we feel because we've been around a person for so long been part of the family Lord and then now that flower has been pulled out of the garden and put into your into your great fold but father you said you'd be a comfort in a time of trouble yes you're the Prince of Peace
