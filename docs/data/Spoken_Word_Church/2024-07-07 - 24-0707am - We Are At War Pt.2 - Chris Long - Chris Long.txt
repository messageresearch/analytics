life's first cry to final breath Jesus commands my [Music] Destiny no power of hell no scheme of man could ever pluck me from his hand till he returns or calls me home this is the power of Christ stand [Music] I Vis sister father she standing about the in at a church was small maybe not that small but that's small and I came up on a Sunday night first time was one black man in the church he didn't stay too [Laughter] long but you know and I think of the people the bapti me in the name of Jesus Christ was a different place from here but they had met brother Dale and he had talked to them one of them pull his whole church out of a Methodist conference but he he stayed for a while then he got to the place that he would not give the prophet credit or guard of pro credit he wanted it to be his own he he lost his mind by doing so and he got to the place that he would not even speak to us anymore but uh it's all about God it's not about one person or one church it's God Alone amen so but I I watched this grow people have come and people have left but God still remain the same and that's what we have to depend on we're going to read this morning from Psalm 27 I I might have told

he's giving me [Music] Victory he's a reality something keeps hold in me amen I'm thankful there's something that keeps holding us this morning and I believe that's the love of God through the sacrifice of his son Jesus Christ and the precious blood amen that's what's holding us this morning God bless you all greet you in the name of the Lord a pleasure to be in the house of the Lord with you I think I got a confirmation this morning the brother read psalms 27 I don't think it was here yesterday and that's the scripture I opened with brother yesterday so we just ride online right in track I think what I'd like to do this morning I don't need to introduce myself no I think we just get right into the word uh of course I'll I'll I'll take as much time as necessary but you all have learned by now that uh I don't try to stretch it out any further than I can but uh we'll let the Lord lead this morning and I think what I probably should do on the advice of my wife is finish reading the rest of the scripture in Hebrews 4:12 she said honey I only got to the word Quicken I said well it was made alive right then and I couldn't do anything else with it it was quickened to me amen so Hebrews 412 and I don't want to borrow a pair of glasses cuz I know where they'll come from I got some over there in my briefcase but I'll just we'll just read it the way it is Hebrews 4:12 you got it say amen amen for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing a suer of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart let us pray father that is the most powerful weapon Lord you could have possibly given any one of us father if we read that scripture we find out Lord that this sword that you have given us father to use is so powerful it's quick it's lifegiving Lord it it knows how to divide the word rightly Lord even between the soul the marrow the joints Lord every bit every piece every part and then to top it off father it becomes the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart that's what we're ask asking for this morning Lord take this sword father I pray and place it in the hand of strong faith to bring it to the heart of the enemy father Lord that's our desire we know we're in a battle Yeah and we're willing and able and anxious Lord now to fight for you amen it's always for your honor and your glory father let us cut the enemy me down this morning father let us see ourselves Lord through your word for who you said we are it's it's not father that we could be or should be but we are amen we are now yes the Sons and Daughters of God for your honor and your glory father we stand here this morning as sister Regina father sang I'm a nobody trying to tell everybody about somebody which is you in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated now brothers and sisters that that did I want you to I want you to consider before we go f any further I just going to give you part two of we're at War amen this is the greatest battle ever fought whether you realize it or not and many of us this morning of course are fighting our own battles and as I as I tried to uh turn the corner yesterday and present to you the fact that it's time for us to stop fighting amongst ourselves and with ourselves and for ourselves I'll tell you why God is made a way now God implemented his Plan of Salvation so that you and I could enter into the battl we know the battle started in heaven am according to Revelations 12 there was a battle that started in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the devil and his angels is that right and and and and we and and then here's the deal I I I I'm going to say it like this for for a segue into this morning's message and prevailed not the Bible says and they prevailed not so there was like a a standoff was a stalemate it's like when you're playing chess and in each in each player has got has got the king yeah uh in check but check made is what you're looking for righten does that make any sense God Made You and I as his bride co-responsible so while there is a mate he has allowed someone to move them chest pieces into position to make it a Checkmate that's the BR of Jesus Christ you know it's the king that's being protected on the chessboard but the peace on the chessboard that has the most movement that has the most power come on brother is the Queen the queen can move in any direction up and down and diagonal back and forth she's put on that board to protect the king amen hallelujah amen and our King see this morning is the word of God amen amen God and His word are one amen you hear it all the time you hear us make as Ministers of the word of God make emphasis constantly and I know you hear it here that the word is the Difference Maker we've come to a point in time where there will be no history come on because it's all about now and the future but the prophet of God pointed out to us that What man does is he occupies his time with looking back to see how things were and looking forward to how things might be but always forgetting about what is now according to the Bible our faith should be now Faith amen amen amen cuz that's a scripture now Faith amen so brothers and sisters let's deal with today but God gave us his word we're creatures of time he's not a creature of time as I mentioned yesterday I I want you to begin to understand through the word of God the message of our hour because the prophet of God emphasizes that it's the message of your hour spiritual food and due season that is going to make the difference for you and I again we can look back or we can look forward but spiritual food in due season is the key and God's word changes not but what does change is the time the age the dispensation and the revelation and the intensity of it we're in a battle right no question about that what are we fighting over what are we fighting for what's the cause well according to Jude and Jude has one chapter I guess I don't even know if you call it a chap chapter Jude says this in verses 5 and six I will therefore put you in remembrance so here we're going to go back okay though you once knew this right amen where did we get this information from how did we want want know what Jude is going to remind us of right we were in him before the foundation of the world right now you and I are told we don't remember that but what Jude is doing here is he's taking a people that have been conditioned amen sir to have amnesia y That's Right am amen right amen God's word is here to declare to you who we are where we came from and where we're going that will cure Amnesia every time because we B P our theophany so we're we're we're we're we're like looking through a glass Darkly but we've come to the place in the journey where now it's face to face according to what Paul taught that's right amen listen now I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people uhuh out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believe not so you see he's a gracious God and he wants everybody saved but not everybody follows the pathway of the prescription of his salvation he paid the price but you and I have to to take the claim all right there's where the battle is amen now what claim what what do we have claim on it's an inheritance right it was given to you and I before the foundation of the world by God when he placed our names in the Lamb's Book of Life I'm just repeating the Bible to you y all should know that right okay without reading every scripture watch here the battle started in heaven and what it was was not a battle with guns and knives and Hand Grenades and and and fighter jets and tanks and artillery it was a war of words right amen Michael and his angels weren't using literal swords clanging them together and Spears and Shields and knives it was a battle between Michael and his angels angels are messengers and the devil and his angels it was a war of words all right you still with me verse six says and the angel s which kept not their first estate this word right here is where the word real estate comes from which we find ourselves preoccupied with yeah right the American dream my patch this my home this my town this is my street amen you think it is yeah that's right brother when the folks in charge decide they want it you may die defending it and just to find out it's not really yours no brother my property's paid off just stop paying your taxes you see we're in a battle amen and I'm I I'm I'm anticipating brothers and sisters that we have spent far too long focusing on the tangible agree amen listen when faith is the substance of thing hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen have you ever looked up the word faith in the dictionary it it says in your dictionary a belief in something for which there is no proof amen right amen that is absolutely contrary to everything that you and I have been raised for right am on this Earth amen but Abraham the father of the faithful caught a glimpse of something that you and I have before us every detail Abraham found himself wandering around the countryside looking for for a city whose Builder and maker was not man amen that's right amen amen H Abraham never found that City in a tangible sense but Abraham knew it existed he could not see it with the natural eye brothers and sisters we're we're in a fight today but we're not fighting flesh and blood as we found out yesterday amen but we're fighting principalities and Powers spiritual wickedness in high places amen amen that's it some of us though are preoccupied with fighting in ourselves I can assure you this morning that there are folks in here that right now this very minute are arguing with themselves y I don't want to be here I'm tired I'm bored I'm this I'm that I'm the other thing and then once we have gotten worn down in that battle we start to think about the guy next to me or the lady in front of me or the guy behind behind the pulpit right it's a battle and as long as you and I stay in that particular battle will'll never be winners that's right we'll never get the victory it's to him that overcometh amen what are we overcoming ourselves Hallelujah and once we have won that battle and we have claimed that Victory and we understand that that enemy has been destroyed God can now use us but we serve a particular God the god that you and I serve has said once you have beat yourself I'll take over amen amen Second Chronicles chapter 20 verse 15 and he said here can ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King ah Jehoshaphat thus sayeth the Lord unto you be Be not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude we know we talked yesterday about a brother a minister who decided to uh kind of do some math and he took the 200,000,000 demons let out on in the river Euphrates in the Book of Revelations yes oh yeah and any kind of narrowed it down using some of the statistics that brother brandom gave you know like one in a milli I yeah and then divide that one and a million amongst how many Christians are on the planet today I don't know it's a small number absolutely brother amen right it could be 10,000 it could be 5,000 it could be 700 I didn't finish yesterday with Gideon my wife said it's 300 started with 32,000 and God said too many amen yes weed out 22,000 right away got 10,000 left he said too many that's right got down to 300 amen and the odds of those 300 facing that Army seemed insurmountable abut but God right here says this be not Afra afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours Hallelujah but God so brothers and sisters I'm here to remind you and encourage you and cheerlead you on this morning that let you hurry up and finish the battle with yourself so that then God can come into the picture and he will take over the battle cuz there ain't no way you and I are going to whoop the Devil Without God but God has instrumentally given you and I the most powerful weapon that God himself uses amen amen yes if we want the battle to be God's then we got to take on God's way of doing it amen he's using you and I in this battle but what he wants from you and I is total surrender we're going into a fight the whole point is yes he wants you to surrender to him so that he can fight for you he can fight with you and he can fight in you that's true Victory brothers and sisters God yes sir you know what I said it yesterday almost say it Joshua a type of the Holy Spirit today Amen brother what confidence right you say well brother what if I make a mistake how can you you get that Holy Spirit down in your soul which is the response of the deep calling to the deep and what you've got is a sure word of Prophecy how do we know that cuz God told us that the author of the word of God which is our weapon the sword of Hebrew 412 is the Holy Spirit the holy spirit's the author of the word amen the holy spirit is the summation of the offices of god father son the Holy Ghost I've said this thousands of times but one of these days brothers and sisters it's going to take heart this is going to take life in you amen it's one God in three offices just like you and me amen I'm a father I'm a son but I am me Hallelujah in the office of a father I look down to my children and I give them as much advice and as love and encouragement and and and and uh and whatever it takes to make them successful right right that's the office of a father or a mother that same guy the same guy that's expected to lead his children into a successful life the same guy has to turn when his father comes and say yes sir no sir right even if you disagree come on come on you don't when I was just 12 or 13 age of accountability I'd say in my mind well my dad was giving me a talking to I know more than he does in my mind I you say that to your dad out loud and it's going to get worse at least in my family it would have got worse but you know how it is come on young people just my mama don't know what she's talking about my daddy just don't know what I'm going through but we do yes amen because of the offices yes right a father and child mother child you understand okay but what about you what about when it comes com down to you that's right amen that's the holy spirit amen the holy spirit is the part of God that's here amen and he wants to have he wants you and I to have him worse than we want him he's worked his whole plan so that you and I can become him and he and his word are one and that is the weapon that he's given us Amen to defeat every enemy but we spend so much time starting with ourselves God has made it so simple for you and I to overcome ourselves even our faith that's right if we put our faith in God's word like the examples that God gave us in this Bible I'm using Joshua because Joshua is a type of the Holy Spirit today Joshua is so close that even his name mean Jehovah savior amen right yeah that's right now Joshua is not Jehovah savior but he was a type of Jehovah savior right he was a type of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was is and always will be God amen amen manifest In the Flesh amen and he did what he did so you and I could be him right that's why it's a battle because the devil don't want you right to be him the devil wants you to be the devil you say oh brother that's harsh he is the most religious guy on the planet that's right we all paint the devil like he's down there in the witches Coen and the warlocks cave dancing around the the pentagram yeah yeah he got a turned around round collar back in a Bible cuz he knows that that's where Authority yes and he's what he wants to be is he wants to be a Creator his brother Wade and now we're talk he there's only one difference between the devil and God the devil can't create it's one of the very reasons why a lot of people Stu stumbled over our Prophet absolutely because God allowed him as a reference for you and I to bring something into existence that wasn't there before now to you and I it seems silly they was just squirrels they were brought in they were brought as Hebrews 11:2 says out of nothing amen amen that's why thank you sister Regina for letting me be nothing amen right amen CU Let Me Tell You Folks something that's where God finds what he's looking for yes [Applause] sir remember something about God he don't need our dirt you know the story everybody's heard it a thousand times for that one person in here who ain't heard it you know go ahead the scientist Satan says I can do that I can bring that into existence God's like you know I was I think I was talking to the angel of the Lord you ever know this the angel of the Lord has anybody ever seen a reference that the angel of the Lord smiled I haven't seen one I mean I'm not saying it ain't there but when the prophet explains the angel of the Lord he's always kind of stern right he could even get upset in a way not not not mad like you and me but you know when brother Brandon was in Africa y and he went and let them fellas talk him into something that God told him you go here you go with Sydney Jackson I'll take care of you he let them mey mouth preachers talk him into nope you be hitchhiking and then Billy Paul said Daddy how we going to get home I would have went but we wouldn't have known that see unless God had sent an example for us and showed us what the results would be if you choose a different way brother brandham nearly died and the angel of the Lord told him I told you not to do that he kind of give us the reference of him and or man Neville brother Neville could class just calm down now you're going to go to your corner if you don't behave Johnny sit down brother brandham said Oran Neville wasn't made like brother brandham that's right the angel of the Lord said Johnny sit down that's the God we serve he wants you and I to be so right so often amen right that he will do whatever is necessary to bring you and I so look if you're having a rough time this morning just throw them hands up and I mean sincerely in your heart say Lord I'm through I give up I don't want to battle anymore and God says I'll do it now I'll take the battle from you I'll fight for you all you got to do is surrender to me seems odd that we're surrendering while we're fighting I mean if you go to Hebrews and read the chapter the few verses before Hebrews 4:12 he's talking about rest brother amen and then he says labor wait a minute I thought we was resting labor rest labor rest we're resting in him Let Me Tell You Folks something we ain't ever going to rest the way you and I think we're going to rest God tried it once after he made everything he rested on the seventh day then the fall happened he had to get back up and go to work amen amen amen come on Amen but when he got back up to go to work he wanted to work through you and me amen God don't labor the way you and I labor God don't strain oh let there be light no God said let there be light amen and he did not keep looking around to see where the light was coming from he went to the next stage of the journey knowing that when he said it light was coming how would you like to have that same Authority that same ability that same confidence in what you say well I'll tell you right now that we're told by the prophet of God that you have thus saith the Lord but the key right there is it's not thus saith Chris long or Wayde Dale or William brandom or the pope or you or it's thus saith the Lord or she keeps quiet and when the seventh seal opened there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour why because it wasn't time for the bride of Christ to receive but God opened that seal so that one man that's right could come in contact with what God has in store for you and I amen and then he closed it up again he opened it and omitted it the Bible says right and to Omit something is to either not allow it to exist or to put it on hold until the time was right brothers and sisters you may not realize this but the seventh seal has been relegated by God to a specific group of people that's the reason why I'm preaching the way I am it got down to 300 in the days of Gideon amen there was only two as brother Michael T pointed out you say what about Moses Moses was told by God that he was going to lead the children of Israel into the promised land that's in the Bible but Moses thought the battle was his and he got annoyed with the children of Israel and smoke the rock twice you and I don't have to Smite The Rock not even one time CU it's already been opened there's a fountain already open in the House of David excuse me brother sir I better back up we're in a battle amen amen but brothers and sisters it's not our battle you can this morning you can stop fighting with yourself right now amen give yourself over Amen to the sacrifice of the blood of Christ accepted in your heart and you become just like every other person that has done the same thing but what people start doing is they start thinking I got to do something and you do have something to do having done all to stand stand stand at your post of Duty because the angels that were in the battle the war of words in heaven between Michael and his Messengers Michael and his preachers y amen and Lucifer and his Messengers Lucifer and his preachers they didn't keep their first estate they refused to occupy the spot that God gave them in the beginning amen and that's where their leader went wrong yeah brother way and I were talking I said think about Lucifer perfect can I say it again perfect Who Wants to Be Perfect watch now watch watch the next one don't raise your hand cuz it's a trick question who thinks they're perfect already he got to thinking perfect in all my ways I can't create I have to borrow his dirt you know the story well I can do that all right go ahead uh hang on just a second I'll I'll be right back where you going I'm going outside to get me a little cup full of dirt he said you get your own dirt if you're going to do like me you can't use my dirt you get you make your own dirt come on look at what science is trying to do today brother bradam said they stumble over a blade of grass just a simple blade of grass oh but my wife and I have a piece a patch we live in the mountains where grass don't grow too Rocky too many pine trees too many pine needles I got a real nice patch of grass brother Lise I never have to mow it you can all use it here in Georgia because you got a lot of mowing to do I can tell when I'm driving down the highway it's artificial yeah right another battle did you know that we are fighting the same fight that Joshua Fought the Battle of AI right you you think it's a coincidence God already knew that man was going to try to come up through the Church of Satan and use artificial intelligence well I got to tell you folks something AI is not artificial intelligence it's almost intelligent that's right yeah think about it artificial intelligence Joshua already fought that battle but the problem with AI is you have to bring something from your past or the history of mankind and bring it over into God's word don't work don't work if you read your Bible you'll find out that achen did not take the accursed thing from AI it never got that far as soon as they started battling an AI and they started losing church members right away right away brother Donnie Joshua said hold it the holy spirit says stop right here right now God told me that we wouldn't lose a man and we'll destroy the enemy stop are you willing to take the advice of the Holy Spirit and as soon as you start to lose some of that Faith some of that fervor and some of that action some of that some of that oh man I I remember how it used to be stop right there because I'm going to tell you what's going on like achen you're gonna you're gonna reach back into Jericho right CU that's where the ours thing came from aen didn't steal from AI he harbored something from the previous battle you see he brought something over from The Battle Before and he hit it in his tent thinking I I got away with it right I got me a a wedge of gold a little silver and think about the types gold deity silver Redemption and then but but but where did he make his H I got me a Babylonian garment you get rid of that thing right now yeah amen the gold and the silver have a place in God's economy if you'll receive it correctly don't steal it don't reach back into somebody or yours past or the last Church you went to or what you used to believe and try to bring it over in to the Battle of AI right it'll end up artificial right right you know what AI means in the Bible it doesn't mean artificial intelligence it means heap of ruins amen what a mess Jericho means like a land of fragrance so you remember you know smells trigger things did you know that I mean everybody in here I remember that smell right there that's in an Out Burger yeah that's what a burger H oh I remember that smell from when I was a child we used to bring bring it back to you like a song get them songs out of your head it's impossible so what you got to do is you got to replace them don't bring them up from the past you got to replace them that's why I wanted sister Regina to sing for me this morning cuz you got to replace them old songs Don't reach back and try to bring one over you know that's what Satan does in the gospel music he reached back into the rhythm and blues and the rock and roll and he brought it right over into here well the words are about Jesus where did the beat come from and the and the beat goes on come on now see we've got to come to a place brothers and sisters where we forget those things which are behind us press toward the Mark it's a battle Paul said I fought a good fight am amen and it's a fight of faith I kept the faith he said yes sir amen that's what we're contending with this morning brothers and sisters you say well brother Chris this this don't seem to be much message it is the message it is the message this message is not predicated on how much you can quote how many drawings you can put on a chalkboard how many graphs and charts you can make they're fine Brother B said those things are fine but what it really boils down to your faith can you put unadulterated 100% confidence in God's word that's the 300 that's the two yeah amen amen right amen Moses was told since he was in that little basket he was probably being talked to brother and he didn't even know what the words meant a little baby were floating him into the can you imagine if he could think like an adult what am I doing out here in this crocodile swamp right mom why are you pushing me out into the crocodiles but his mama knew the church knew you can't be harmed no right it was confirmed to her and her husband that Moses was the deliverer Moses didn't even know he was the deliverer and the deliverer was floating through the crocodiles God had purposed it yes cuz look at the way it end ended up that little cradle them them crocodiles might have been up there bumping it with their nose they didn't even know they were steering it to Pharaoh's do and little little Miriam in the in the in the bull rush is watching it oh oh it ended up right there at the court of Pharaoh's daughter she ran back and told her mama y think about this this is Pharaoh's house and Moses's mom yaked was like a Hebrew slave right but Pharaoh's daughter wasn't lactating so there was a problem how in the world did they end up picking Moses's mom brother this is the God we serve see I'm preaching this way because I want your confidence to be built solely on God's word not the preach not the pastor not the prophet God's word but the prophet is God's mouthpiece right that's right amen I believe that with all my heart that's why constantly prophets are mistaken yeah for God because God is speaking through them they're an instrument being used by God to declare God's word to our ears amen amen amen what will we do with it you said well that can't be God's Prophet test it brother I challenge you to test it and see taste and see that the Lord is good brothers and sisters I'm preaching on a battle it's going on right now in your minds but one once you take on the mind of Christ and get rid of your mind how how can I do it brother the Bible gives us the prescription it's called The Power of transformation and because I didn't finish what brother juwel said yesterday I'll finish it this morning the butterfly is the mystery of the caterpillar revealed is that that's a brother juwel statement right there oh yeah pre oh it's beautiful think about did you all know that a caterpillar only has one job and one job only and some of you and I ought to be I'm good at it you put me in front of a Dunkin Donuts I'm good at it listen everybody I found out about Danny's Donuts in Gainesville I'm going there tomorrow oh I'm going bro now I like bear claws cuz I'm a Hunter right yeah I don't do a lot of gathering yeah but I like to hunt and right now I'm hunting amen I'm hunting for one of you who take God at his word that's right brothers and sisters it might might sound silly and I might look goofy to you but I'm telling you right now you take God at his word you take every word of listen y'all want the token yes how many knows how valuable the token is you ain't going in the Rapture without the token right because the token is what you need to get on board is that right the token is what you need to get in well what did the prophet of God what did God tell us through that Prophet come on full obedience to the whole word right listen now that's not the token brother way that's not what it says entitles you access full obedience to the whole word amen that's the challenge this morning amen that's the battle we're in amen can oh brother you don't understand you don't understand me I you're looking at the only man you may ever meet who has been excommunicated from the same church twice that's not a joke I know it seems funny I have been excommunicated from the same church two times brother two times I thought once you was excommunicated once you was one and done I ain't telling you the story we'll get to that later yeah it's way back see I don't want to reach back I don't want to reach back into Jericho I don't want to drag something over from Jericho into the Battle of AI because for you and I it's not a battle AI does not mean artificial intelligence to you and I it means absolute intelligence amen amen and you and I can't come up with that we sure ain't going to beat artificial intelligence by reaching back it's all about going forward amen amen forgetting those things as Paul say brothers and sisters we're in a battle we're in a real genuine fight right now amen absolutely come on yes we are brother I mean it's so simple some of us are fighting to stay awake yeah some of us are fighting to stay interested some of us are fighting ourselves it's really you're really fighting you're not fighting me because this is not a flesh and blood Affair no flesh and blood cannot inherit as we said yesterday right no it can so why are we spending so much time on something that is not gun and can't inherit amen that's right H it's your soul amen amen it's your soul that's important it's the real you way down on the inside amen you know the one that keeps the secrets yeah so if God would reveal a secret to you and I he's opening up his own soul absolutely yes I'll tell you just saying that mhm yes amen makes me feel good all amen yeah amen amen cuz I believe it I believe yeah I believe God's word amen well brother you don't understand my life is a compromise so is Abraham's that's right we wouldn't have known this because the Bible tells us Abraham stagger not that's right think about Abraham he stagger not he got a he got you got a relationship with God there briefly and then it was follow him Abraham where are you going come on I want everybody in the room to put yourself if God came to you today and he told you to leave your home leave your family and go somewhere but he didn't tell you where you was going you just try to explain that to your family where you going he's gone crazy come on that's what we it's gone nuts the guy's telling us that God's talking to him and God told him to go somewhere and he don't even know where he's going no he did Abraham amen but what he did know is God talked to him and from that point on it didn't matter whether he knew the name of the town or the cross streets it was just March Abraham yes amen where am I going you're going on a 2 5 year Journey if he would have told him that Abraham would have kept the calendar with him that's why no man knoweth the day or the hour the Gentiles don't have a calendar to go on it's when the last one of us right amen comes to full maturity in the body of Christ we're sealed believe that brother amen we're sealed amen amen you won't have a care or a worry cuz you'll know amen that you found Lord the Builder yes amen of the city yes that Abraham was looking for amen amen and that's really what matters brothers and sisters amen this life is a passing Shadow it's just a passing Shadow now Young Folks don't look at it that way because they and but Solomon cleared that up for us I was young once and I can look back at what Solomon said and I said now that man had wisdom he did yeah cuz youth is Vanity yeah you know youth doesn't know that there's an end no you're right they only know right I've just begun that's right right still with me Jude 5 and six kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved an everlasting chains and I put in parenthesis for me bonds right amen bound okay under Darkness that'd be Joshua 9:13 I keep referring to Joshua for a reason because we're in a battle and he according to the prophet of God is The Greatest Warrior outside of Jesus Christ but remember Joshua bypasses the like you and me so he's in the same condition we're in Jesus knew where he came from he did he knew who he was and he knew where he was going you and I seem to be guessing it's not a guess right if you'll take God at his word am amen put all your confidence God's God's way of doing things is so incredibly different from what you and I think right you know in Joshua he was fighting a battle and the sun was going down and it was getting dark outside and he knew he needed more time yeah right man right now what Joshua did goes against all physics all science all astronomy everything right he said Son stand still immediately the scientific mind will go to no no it's already standing still and the and the and the and the Earth is rotating around it you know what I will not argue with you but catch this there came a time when Joshua said sonst and it's been standing still ever since believe that and I just love it when somebody from the scientific realm would say well 60 trillion years ago were you there yeah 15,000 were you there right they're they're trying to tell us there was no flood were you there amen they're trying to tell us there was no crucifixion were you there on I think there's a song about that is it were you there that's right were you there we were there yeah it's the only reason brothers and sisters you and I can sit in a building like this on a Sunday morning and tolerate nobody yeah right yeah we had to be there amen and there's a connection being made yeah come on but I don't see that connection amen thank you brother I love it when congregation preaches for it's an invisible Union so can I give you some advice stop looking for it amen right stop trying to explain it now when you're in a war when you're in a battle now remember that promise was made to Joshua as a physical tangible type yes Joshua keep my word and you won't lose a soldier a warrior there won't brother bam said it like this there won't be first aid there won't be Red Cross there won't be mash units there won't be there won't be a Band-Aid there won't be mcure Chrome there won't be Campo phenique there won't be rubbing alcohol there won't be emu there will be no need wd4 there won't be no need I understand sister Leah that that's a Greek thing I learned that WD40 spray it on your joints and everything is good Windex Windex I'm sorry but think about it though come on now it doesn't really work however if your mind believes it works it's Faith the law of Faith operating in Windex works it ain't the Windex it's the faith in questions and answers in 64 brother Bram had Howard caps get up and read a newspaper article about the Beatles on tap right amen wheelchairs crutches oh I'm getting to the infirmary part now by the wayall think about it I I'm a witness my mom was a singer and she followed music and they had the television on in my home when the Beatles came to Shay Stadium in New York City and there was crutches flying people getting up out of wheelchairs people undressing yeah and brother brandham says after brother caps reads the article he says you see brothers and sisters you can't rely on those things oh I caught that right away we believe in signs wonders and miracles but you can't rely on them I'll tell you why they follow right right right right they're back here we don't need to do like a can and reach back right they're automatic God need to look over his shoulder and say where's the sun I called for it two trillion years ago he said it and he went forward and whether the sun liked it or not it was developing in a world that was unseen right amen and eventually it was bringing light because that light was going to be necessary for the next stage of the journey which is that flying Ice Cube going through the air and whoop stopping right there Y A lot of people think that the Earth in The Big Bang Theory stopped right there brother way just exactly just exactly the right distance from the Sun to bring forth life I got news for you the sun said oh is Right Where I need it and then there was light amen see we're thinking in terms of education and Academia of reason of conscience of memory of affection brothers and sisters those are fine when they agree with the word of God but when they don't agree with the word you leave them in Jero amen leave them in Jericho cuz you'll never win the next battle no right brother people think artificial intelligence is something new it's not new it's a new term but it's not a new way of doing things that's true that's right come on we anybody that that knows about the history of the way things have worked up to this point knows they've been using algorithms for years how do you think they draw up commercials to get you to take a dirty plate with eggs on it and dip it in the sink with soap in there and pull it out it spotless brother bradam see when he saw that commercial he did on the sidewalk looking through a television you know they used to sell TVs right on the street he saw that he said ah I got it I'm going to go home right now and I'm going to show my wife how it's done didn't work out sis out honey let me show you puts a little apron on runs the sink squirts some soap in there takes the the plate from the breakfast with the with the syrup and the eggs and the and the leftover hash browns and he dips it in there and he pulls out he said just as dirty as it was a form of artificial intelligence not that brother brandom had that but he was he was naive on that point he was he was still being formed he didn't know he learned why he this is what brother brandham learned from that would you learn the same thing that he learned this morning from artificial intelligence didn't work amen and he said I'll never trust Hallelujah another television commercial as long as I live you think you and I can get oh no look at they're having such a good time I me that's what their picture oh look at the the women look so good oh the men look so strong that's that's all it is bro right I mean come on I want everybody to understand I know you know this but it's truth and we're in a battle now I'm I'm explaining things that you understand so that we can bring in things that you don't understand but you believe [Applause] them does anybody in here know the story of Billy Paul and the Sharks come on everybody knows on a testimony Billy Paul brandham told everybody that his daddy told him after he come out of the building in choosing of a bride Billy you won't be an old man before sharks are swimming through the doors of the May Company everybody's waiting we're going to see if it happens you know what I told a group of people that asked me about it is it on tape right right is it in the Bible oh I'm not discounting Billy Paul I believe his daddy told him that but you see we're all trying to put an interpretation to it and then when Billy Paul got 65 well what how old is an old man and he got 70 how old is an old man then he got how old is an old man then got 85 and he started going downhill quick how old is it ain't going to come to pass run for your lives well that's the way people are you may think I'm being dramatic but I want you to know that's the way people are if you ain't doing it here this morning you doing it inside you doing it in here right for your lives this guy's a maniac that's what they thought about brother Brandon come on that's right amen oh you was called to pray for the sick but don't you say a word yeah brother man would say that's not Bible praise the Lord but let me help clear something up for the sake of Billy Paul I believe his daddy told him that guess what Billy Paul's not with us anymore but he's not an old man he's a young man yes he is you see see how we try to put a tangible you know reasonable interpretation to things we're in a battle we're in a battle brother Lis you know that you go out we're in a battle everybody in here is in a you don't have to be a preacher no you children who have to go to school or in a battle even if you don't go to public school you're in a battle why because you were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies full of trouble and short of days and you got battles going on Amen amen but God has ordained an infirmary yeah amen amen how many knows what an infirmary is you know now what we see is the what do they call the quick medical places you run into Quick okay quick care emergeny care that's probably the word I love oh I cut my finger yeah I bump my head run to the emergency care did you all realize that it's not about helping you right right now some ladies and men in here might work at the emergency cares I'm not imputing you I'm talking about the reason why they're on the corner yeah money it's all about money not not not your desire possibly to help mankind that's not where but they're they're using you they're using your desire to help mankind cuz you you said it brother Louise you ever seen a commercial which we're not supposed to trust for whatever ails you I don't care what it is they got a pill for it read the fine print would you yeah please you might have a cough you might have a cold you might have psoriasis you might have dandruff you might have patchy spots on your skin you might have achy joints you might have arthritis you might have a thousand different maladies but if you read the fine print you ain't taking that pill because you're going to end up with 10 or 12 things much worse than what you got possibly come on yes it's all about the money it's all about power it's all about control you don't think we're not in a battle amen do you want me to bring it down here today have I got more time wait I don't want to take your valuable time because I do believe this I'm not saying this out of false I'm a nobody but I've been sent here to try to help everybody amen amen to let you know about somebody who really does care yeah amen he really does care amen believe that with all my heart yeah amen amen I'm going to bypass some notes brother Wade knows how I am and I'm sorry brothers and sisters that I'm not better at this but this is the way God made me who's not in a battle raise your hand some some conflict you're in some conflict We're All in This Together We're All in This Together amen fighting the good fight amen but God provided a way for you and I yes did to be restored yes from every conflict yes from every battle and it's that little room off the side of the tent that's why psalms 27 is about the rapture but there's a Pavilion in there amen there's war in there there's a there's not one word seemingly in Psalms 27 about the Rapture but brother brandham used it when he preached the Rapture so what's in there right what's in there so I'm going to fast forward to the infirmary you know cuz we're all beat up right now for one reason or another heartaches and so forth and of course the passing of brother Samuel oh right what a wonderful man amen he's way better off can we give him that he's way better off amen and Let Me Tell You Folks something as much as he loved all of you and me and Wade and sister Peggy and everybody he don't want to come back the prophet of God said I don't want to go back but he didn't have a choice you going back you're going back cuz I need need you to tell everybody how wonderful this land is you know when you was 15 I already sent you down to the regions of the lost but I want you to go back and tell them don't go there do everything you can not to go there regions of the Lost what happened they lost the battle yes hallelu but when you go beyond the curtain of time you're in the Victory Camp got that right amen amen but they're still waiting that's right they're still waiting yes amen oh they're having a good time they're not sweating they're not hungry they don't have to pay bills they have to go to work they don't get sore they don't get sick they look real nice they're young and and and Youthful and energetic and so forth and full of love Hallelujah does that sound good that's not Perfection Perfection requires 's the end of the war and when the battle's over amen we shall wear a crown after the battle Abraham met with MDC and think about Abraham's battle he just went down to rescue lot and I I've said this before but I I wanted to sink in you know that I personally would have never known nor could find a way to know that lot was saved outside of a prophet saying his righteous Soul was vexed because for me brother Wade I would have thrown the word righteous soul out and said he's vexed right amen I wouldn't have understood that his righteous Soul was his salvation right amen amen but don't you ever forget that's a type of the foolish virgin and I'm not settling for foolish virgin I'm I'm not settling for anything less than wise virgin cuz brother Bram in 144,000 and the 10 virgins tells us there's two classes in this saved group lot was saved the Sheep at the white Throne judgment are going to be saved but the bride is salvation don't we understand that it's time for us to go on Amen Hallelujah I make this statement brother Wade and there's a lot of people that don't like it but I believe it with all my heart salvation is the end result for the church but it's just the beginning for the bride they're both saved but the bride says something in her keeps driving her there's something more I'm not satisfied oh I'm saved but there's something more what is more than salvation lot was saved amen come on right brother I'll tell you what's more than salvation meeting with mzd no father no mother no beginning of days no ending of life here let me let here here Abraham drink from my cup amen now we go to Jesus see drink from my can can you drink from my cup yes he said I believe you can but it's not time here we are in time it's time amen it's time it's time for you and I I to lay down the sin the unbelief that so easily besets us amen and that's us constantly turmoil in ourselves and in our families and at our jobs and down at the church Listen to Here the church don't save you Church don't save you but it'll keep you saved brother said the blood don't save you blood don't save you keeps you saved and then in and uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother Bram says the church is the blood spiritually speaking today that's right by the spirit amen guess what we are then amen guess what the Church of the Living God is it's the carrier of the life brother oh now you got power now you got Authority amen we've been given the authority to become the son sons of God ACC John 1 I believe that with all my heart brothers and sisters but what are we doing with it come on now toiling amen come on fighting come on brother we're in a different battle right now watch this I'm GNA say this because I know we're streaming and and and and and I'm I'm not a streamer I'm not I don't have public this and I don't have social that it's okay if you do it's not for me I want to stay in nobody yeah as long as possible amen because you let your banner out there long enough they're watching you oh we're not afraid I didn't say he was afraid but brother bam said some of y'all is going to give your life as a martyr and I want to preach this God gospel yeah until we're caught up to meet him in the air caught up his blessed face to share very soon he will come and take his children home and I want to be preaching till we leave this earth alone amen brothers and sisters I'm not afraid I don't have to filter turn off I don't have to get an encrypted phone I don't care about nothing they're listening to us right now if you got a cell phone in this building and that cell phone is on they are listening to this gospel right now they are they have the ability to turn your camera on and watch you and whatever you're looking at right I have friends in the tech business that's what they tell me brother they give them expensive phones away because they're watching you right but there's an all cni Hallelujah there's an all C right watching us that's the one I care about cuz brother brandham said when they try to close you up you're going up so bring it off cuz I'm ready I'm ready to take the Chariot ride to the air but brothers and sisters I'm preaching to a group of people that are select that are elect that are special amen amen you've got to understand that you're special yes sir because people that have gone on before us they get to raise from the dead their body gets changed they go in the Rapture but you and I have the Rapture within us we got the Millennium in us we got the resurrection in us and it's going to stay right there until you and I ready amen so let's get ready amen so I'm going to talk to you about the tent Vision yes amen say man where did you get that from well I tell you what we could spend days breaking it down I I I my wife tells me and to her benefit I'm not real good with some words but you know people have been using this tent Vision that brother BR that's what we call it it's a succession of Visions it's the succession of brother Brandon being taken from one place to another from one place to another from one place to another now I believe brother Brandon was God's prophet and I believe that his Visions will come to pass the problem that we have is interpreting that's correct but there's one sure interpretation that cannot fail I know what you're going to tell me it's a prophet no the Bible says prophets can fail prophecy can fail this I don't believe blood Ram's word fails now it's God's word but let me tell you folks something we're at the time where like in the Book of Judges where's the prophet right oh it's the Holy Ghost brother BR told us the Holy Ghost is your Prophet today and if you got that Prophet living in of you guess what you're the benefactor from the prophecy coming to pass the interpretation of a prophecy is by bringing it to pass is that right once it's come to pass it's interpreted guess what God has ordained for you and I to become yes the coming to pass of the prophecy amen amen look it sure amen you say well well if if I die tomorrow you say well brother Chris has not left well I'm still with you yeah amen guess what's happening when you go to the other side they're pulling for you absolutely brother yes yeah talk about a third pull yeah amen pull for you yeah come on right come on Amen come on you can do it and and if you fall by the wayside come on come on come on you can do it but it's not you it's not the individual it's the mystical Body of Christ made up of many Members First Corinthians 12 tells us come on come on you can do it come on you can do it amen one falls to the right one Falls to left come on you can do it come on they're not stopping and when you fall to the right or the left and you go up beyond the curtain of time you're going to go come on you can do it come on you can do it they're pulling on us don't try to explain it that's the mistake the prophet made in the tent Vision that's right so I'm not going to try to explain it to you brother Lis but I'm going to give you what God has given me amen I'm going to get right down to where the Tent Service is going on big great grand now he called it other things than just a tent did he didn't only use the word tent but when you understand what a tent is a tent by definition is a stretched piece of skin that's where the word came from so I like to go back to the roots okay now Malachi says I'll leave neither root nor Branch oh we're going back even further than the Roots come on we're going back to the mind of God and God has set things up in such a way where there's a big meeting going on now I want you to notice something about this this okay brother Wade there's something about this meeting going on if you read about it and I'm going to quote to you or paraphrase out of what is a vision now brother brother brandom doesn't only talk about it in that message there's one before that that he gives a little bit and there's a couple after that that he talks about and then he talks about it in the seals he talks about it he goes into this God has set up an infirmary for you and me Amen brother yeah it's that little room there amen off to the side because a lot of people think that's the resurrection they got it all wrong you ain't going to raise missing a limb you ain't going to rais being paralyzed you ain't going to be raised walking on crutches that ain't in the Bible Abraham didn't stagger into Jerusalem that day on the day of the Resurrection say honey check it out no that's right brother come on amen that's right because he staggered not yeah amen but the prophet of God said he staggered all over the place one of the places he staggered is when he was confronted by the Pharaoh is that Pharaoh is that the president the ruler the [Music] CEO confronted by the guy in charge and said your wife oh that's not my wife what did he do right there brother Wade he took his crutches out that's not my wife that's my sister come on he he got his crutes out he was afraid amen got out his crutches staggered all over the place no he did not you see the faith that he had in God staggered not but Abraham as a human being compromised but he would never compromise on God's word see that wasn't a test of whether he believed God or not it was a test of whether Abraham understood Abraham yes that's right amen was his half sister so he only told half the truth God his crutches out no staggered and guess what happened when when Sarah was taken from him brother he was paralyzed I don't mean physically he didn't know what to do got a paralysis patience in here see I'm not preaching on the physical now I believe in the physical amen but I want you to understand that all scripture and all prophecy is compound amen so here we come to the tent right brother brandom is not happy right he's up above the tent he is not on the platform right no he says seemingly like he had just got done preaching didn't he brother seemingly he says well put on a tape would you brother wait yeah yeah well I'm just I'm just I want you to see the whole picture I'm not I'm not battling anybody I want you to see the whole battle plan right amen that's all cuz the devil is here to deceive you and he will use any means that he can to get you from finding out who you really are cuz once you find out who you really are he's in deep trouble he's done lost the war we're in a battle but he doesn't want to lose the war he realizes in the in the battle you can lose a few constituents some church members can go by the wayside and he'll just build it up again yeah it's the war he's concerned with because the because when the war is over it's finished we all got to sit down and sign the treaties yeah right yeah and guess what happens to him nurg trials yes right he going to prison for a thousand years let's just put him in there and let him think about it h yeah that's right I mean think about he's going to be chained up in in a in a pit for a thousand years and he's going to get out and think I'll do it again yeah I'll get him this time I don't think so amen but what I'm bringing to you brothers and sisters I want I want you to understand something because cuz everybody wants to either make that Vision all an actual thing and come on now them big rainbow trout brother Brandon wasn't trying to catch fish just read the vision no right amen he was being taught how to catch the big the Deep those that are see he he he he says this I remember he says I throw it way out deep Y and people say we don't need the Deep teaching oh yeah if you're a little bitty fish that just barely can stretch Over The Lure no you don't but if you one of them big rainbow trout amen you didn't get small by Chasing The Lure no you got big by eating and eaten and eaten eat believe you see that's a caterpillar it's one job it only has one motivation eat eat eat eat now like the caterpillar those rainbow trout are going to be transformed did you know that when when when when the butterfly is forming inside the little casing that's stuck to the tree that started out as a caterpillar when something happens the power of transformation happens and not one piece of DNA not one single cell is shared by the butterfly and what it was Lord amen cuz I don't want this old guy amen I don't want to have to reach back and get one spec no of this old man no no I want a new me amen but you see a new me is the guy that's been there since before the foundation of the world Amen in the victory Circle yeah amen because we've won a we've won a battle we fought a battle that's right we've taken it to the enemy oh yeah God used it right to take that enemy to his knees amen amen so here's a woman on one side of that little room I could just preach on this for days a little piece of stretched canvas he said between the tent meeting and the little room he wasn't happy about the meeting do you know why because after seemingly brother Brandon preached and they said he's not here right now he's resting they took up an offering and brother brandham was not pleased right right about the money there's a group of people off to the side and brother brandham said that cross and brandham Tabernacle was fitly placed on the right side the thief amen that asks for forgiveness amen it's all you got to do and I mean really genuinely I'm not I don't mean because you're afraid I don't mean because you don't want to suffer the I mean because something down on the inside said Lord I'm a sinner yes I'm genuinely hurting because I don't want to hurt you yeah right please forgive me Lord yeah amen please forgive me for being what I was and make me what I should be that's the desire of a real genuine Christian they're not trying to buy time they're trying to get rid of time amen that's right CU time shall be no more in Revelations 10 right so brother bam explains there a little room it's about 12 by 20 and this place and what is a vision there's a door on each side so see for years I used to try to think well maybe it's the Tabernacle in the wilderness and maybe it's the holy Place wrong size and there's not two doors but this has a door going in and a door going out amen and there's there's a woman there's a church remember don't ever forget about the B Bible says remember Lot's wife right amen lot was saved but remember his church she w Battle of AI she just couldn't withstand the temptation to look back I don't want you to look back from this day forward stop looking back at the world at your life at what's gone on I don't it it could be terrible but you're not going to get anywhere by looking back always look forward like those four living creatures in Ezekiel 1 they didn't go backwards wherever they went they was going forward I don't care if they was going right left reverse or forward they was going forward according to the Bible so there's a a woman on one side of the door and she's got a what look like a notebook maybe and she's taking names come on I'm just tell what you you check me out would you would you please go and listen and read it I challenge you cuz this is not a story no sir this is not brother Chris making it up right this is me reciting what the prophet said okay I don't have the full interpretation but I'm in it yeah got that right amen did you get that you may not have the full interpretation but if you believe you're in it guess what you are going to be it it is going to come to pass and you are are the reason why believe that with all my heart amen taking names what was she doing we got new names yeah we do don't get me your old one and the first patient in the infirmary was a woman who was paralyzed on a stretcher come on brother that stretcher went through that door woman church was paralyzed yes amen right there was a church right outside taking names why because they wanted more members yeah they want to keep track a little social media going on you know I got lots of friends you just y you gonna find out whether you got friends got that right amen you just get them sideways one time you ain't got no friends Jesus thought he had friends this was God In the Flesh yeah amen he got down to 11 followers and do you realize that in three and a half years of signs wonders and miracles and preaching the gospel in his pure unadulterated form that he only ended up with 120 people that would actually follow through and do what he said out of the thousands that was fed out of the thousands that went through the prayer lines out of the thousands that listen to him Sermon on the Mount 120 showed up at the upper room and decided to take God at his word they didn't even know it was going to happen cuz brother bam told us they was in there going hey it's three days out I think we got it you ain't got nothing right you could just imagine they was battling with one another were they was battling with themselves I think I got it now you're the same old guy sit down yeah well right brother bam give us that they was in there dissertating with one another I think I got it nah you ain't got it I think you no come on isn't that going on this morning in the building now here is the victory even though they may not have had it till the Holy Spirit came down 10 days later they were there to get it yes amen they were in the building they were there I hate to tell yall this but lot had home meetings amen two inspired brother brandom said anointed Angel Messengers came to lot's house no I'm not against home meetings but they shouldn't stay there lot should have caught the revelation of them two Messengers and he should have said what a the mistake I made yes get back to Abraham and his faith amen no he was content yeah and I'm talking about meetings careful right I am no because I'm not again I want everybody to understand we're not preaching against house meetings they've been happening since the beginning of time I mean Cain and Abel had a house meeting how'd that end up yeah you've got to go on Amen full obedience to the w h o l e a l l all whole the whole word am we're the only people ever outside of Jesus Christ who didn't come the way you and I come that can fulfill that because the whole word wasn't revealed till today so now we got to put our entire obedience into every word amen yes oh that's impossible brother no it ain't be ye therefore perfect even as my Father which is in heaven is perfect and brother Bram answered that he said God made a way I'm going to tell you that God's way flesh and blood did not reveal that to you Peter my father who made the way to Perfection revealed that to you and that's the rock come on it's the Chief Cornerstone it's the Keystone it's The Headstone it's the head of the corner it's the building amen everything else is fitly every other word is fitly framed together as it gets to the top that brother well no Capstone was ever on that pyramid she's here this morning excuse me she's here this afternoon you and I come on make up that Capone brother no you don't understand yes I do I understand that it was once a caterpillar yes oh yeah now it's a butterfly amen it's got Wings it can fly it's got nothing nothing to do with what it was before it's been transformed by the renewing of its mind amen is that Romans 12 thank you right now I know I'm keeping you a long time but he said keep them but brother waade it's not your fault don't take the blame I'm preaching to you like this as I heard brother brandham say on a message message I listened to yesterday I'm going to preach today like it's the last message that I'll ever preach and it's the last message you'll ever hear because someday it's going to be the last [Applause] one and when the battle's over we shall wear a crown we not only will wear a crown the songwriter wasn't inspired and the day you and I live in will be the crown am right yes amen cuz he said in future home you are the jewels that's right in that Crown amen believe that with all my heart amen yes sir so en closing a paralyzed woman if I'm not mistaken she's paralyzed all her life I'll have to read up on it but she was paralyzed completely totally somehow she got into that little infirmary there door was closed on one side have no idea whether the door was open or closed on the other side alls I know is not hardly seemingly any time went by it was probably just the passing of the gurnie the passing of the stretcher get off that stretcher get out of that wheelchair I'm not talking physical now I believe in the physical of course manifestations but I want you to see men have been trying to make it either one or the other why can't it be both who said it can't be Prophet said compound and we've got a church right now brothers and sisters I'm being so so honest from the inside out to you how in the world could God's Prophet say I'm not doubting him I'm not even questioning him but if he was here and he said it to me I would ask him a question brother brand what did you mean when you said that the body of Christ is the sickest body you know see right it's you look at it you go wait a minute why would we want to go from one sick condition to another yeah right yeah why would we want to move from one dimension of sickness to another dimension of sickness it didn't make sense to me brother I begin to ponder to meditate I've been meditating for 46 years on the message of the hour yeah every day all night except for the fitful sleep I get it's God's word amen that don't make me better than nobody it just I want you to understand the desire that I have for God's children amen amen cuz brother bradam said I could quit right now I could go fishing the rest of my life and be saved yes he would have been but you're we're bride bride yeah we're going Beyond amen yes salvation I know that it's throwing people go ahead brother especially ministers they Brothers I'm just repeating what brother BR said there two classes in the same group well what classes are they right 144,000 and the foolish virgin and then the wise virgin what are they y have I given you enough on the little room yeah you understand a brother goes in there nexts with crutches the woman comes flying out pushing her stretcher down the street and then there's another church on the other side another woman on the other side of the door saying what happens she said I don't know yeah amen not a what do you mean you don't know third pull can't explain it not a public show seventh seal silence opened omitted y That's right let just take all that in right and I'm closing yeah I know you said that please stand there's so much brothers and sisters you see we just if we would just break the bonds of being creatures of time am that doesn't mean that we need to sit in the church for six hours and hear spoken words The Original Seed you can hear that in 10-minute increments as a matter of fact I suggest five minute increments let it's so in take it in take it in you know don't eat it all at once you you know it'll be like Thanksgiving I can't move I've eat too much turkey this is real amen and I'm getting everything I got out of this message now you may disagree with my interpret I'm not trying to interpret it to you I'm trying to introduce to you the idea that God is not a creature of time cuz the prophet of God said that in what message adoption you can be born in the family of God and still not be adopted right now there's controversy brother way you may know about it oh adoption is the Holy Ghost it is not you already got to have the Holy Ghost born in the family of God in order to be adopted because the Bible says in Luke that he was full of the Holy Ghost and then he went out into the Wilderness you think you in a battle Yeah right brother man amen what was the next thing after he was full of the Holy Ghost in the wilderness tempted by the devil we're talking about God manifest In the Flesh tempted by the devil adoption is Mount Transfiguration that's right and he already done had the Holy Ghost yes sir right that's where we're at amen right you see we're being transfigured we're being transformed believe that with all my heart brother brandham said Jesus was trans figured into his coming day yeah hallelujah amen and guess who that is yes the mystical body of Jesus Christ amen the bride amen yes amen you get the Holy Ghost now you get it in your soul yeah don't you wait in another minute you start working on yourself oh I didn't mean to throw yourself prostrate here on the on the pews I'm talking about you let the Inside Man work the outside man to where the outside man don't exist no more and don't worry what's going to happen to the Inside Man he's going to become a butterfly let's pray father let us not be paralyzed father either completely or or or partially Lord yes Lord it comes back father to the beginning of these Services 53 years father this post has been here yes the prophet of God told us that the devil would use the same tactics at the end that he used at the beginning on Eve he must have also employed it to those angels that fell there in Jude Lord [Music] and that is father that he preached the gospel hath God not [Music] said but he added and at the same time he added Lord he took away because of the word not it's a negative it takes away from but he added it in there Lord and he tripped up the first bride yes down here on the Earth but God you told us in your word that there would be a bride that would not stumble she would not fall she would not need crutches she don't need a stretcher Lord what you said to us father is that Eve was disarmed by the devil and because of that Lord she could not fulfill Isaiah 531 to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed because she was disarmed right now father you provided an infirmary yeah a scriptural place for us to go the angel of the Lord told brother Brandon when he said I don't understand that closet yes Lord you know that drove me to go to the scriptures and find the word closet you go into your closet and pray yes I look that word up in the Bible Lord you know and that word closet doesn't mean a little room that holds a coat and a hat and an umbrella right it says that it is a private chamber either the queen or the king's chamber where they receive private guests oh Lord that just sent me right there father I knew then Lord that that church that was paralyzed and that church on the one side and the other that was trying to figure out how it worked Lord you told the prophet that was the first and the second pull but you told the prophet you can't explain this don't try to explain it stop trying to explain it just preach the word to the many or the few and let me fight the battle and I'll do the work in their soul yes we're here this morning Lord reporting for duty at this post and father it's with joy on speakable and full of Glory father that we enlist in your Mighty Army amen Invincible you said by taking you at your word amen we cannot fail if we'll just surrender yeah not to the enemy Lord but to you yes that'll drive the enemy away resist the devil yeah and he will flee amen resist him by surrendering to god father we're thankful this morning we love your children each and every one father those that we know and those that we haven't gotten to know Lord there'll be there will come a time brother juel sings about it won't it be a time oh won't it be a time lord when we get to the other side father when these vile corrupt bodies are changed father into in corruption this Mortal takes on immortality Lord and we've got to be close father because your Apostle Paul told the Corinthians at the last Trump amen we're so close Lord we're so close that we can smell it and taste it father our taste buds are driven by our ability to smell father we're right there father I pray that you'd let us lay aside every sin every unbelief that's so easily Bess father take you out your word begin to look into Moses's script bag Lord It's the Bible amen it's the message of his hour amen it's the message of our hour Lord Lord we're looking in there father and we're finding out Lord that there's a place a resting place a pavilion a tabernacle father will we find peace and rest even in your own words Lord you said you think I come to bring peace I come with a sword that's the word of God and Father it does the dividing aunder it does the Discerning of the thoughts and intents of the Heart Lord what a powerful weapon you gave us father it's without money and without price father and there's not a person father on this planet that wouldn't pay all they had yeah and all they could ever earn yeah yeah for that ability sir that that sword gives and father you've placed it you've placed it in the hands of those that have strong faith so that we can bring it to the the very point of it Lord so that he can get the point father to the heart of the enemy amen bless your children for their efforts for their support Lord for coming here this morning and putting up father with this longterm longdistance message message Father and father it's just just a a twinkle of an eye if we were not creatures of time bless brother Wade Lord in his efforts to stand strong like Joshua taking the message that Moses had given and then finding God in all of it and being able to take the children further across the river Jordan death to self death to the world Lord and into the promised land where the prophet of God said now you're in for a fight y'all thought you were fighting over there in the wilderness but now you're in for it but let me tell you folks something God said you do it my way you won't lose so father let us surrender to your way I pray for your honor and your glory and the precious and the wonderful name of Jesus Christ Amen brother Louise God bless you all have a

we'll sing a song and then read scripture and I'll get changed and come around the other way but if anybody else wants to be baptized we got plenty of cloth we got plenty we got plenty of towels if we have to go buy some we'll go buy some towel but we'll baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and if you want to be baptized you just get in line but our brothers come to make a profession of his faith that he wants to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're going to oblige him with doing that amen we thank God we've got a pool we can do it here where we don't have to travel anymore to go baptized we can do it right here at home so we sure appreciate you love you with the love of the Lord thank you for coming uh Wednesday night service I'll be doing it so uh let then we got whatever that weekend is two weeks from now coming up with u um going to brother Andre's we're going on Friday Saturday uh some of you ask if you want to just come Saturday and spend the night Saturday night and Sunday but I need to know that because we got to get rooms for Friday night Saturday night and then we'll be leaving Sunday right after the service maybe going to the farmer's daughter and eating or you can go home whichever one but we sure would like for anybody to go um we'll try to do our best to help with accommodations like I said before uh we're going to look at uh getting rooms and stuff and then U um if you want to look and get you this is another suggestion Jun and I are have been looking at airbnbs and and um and vbo and there are several in Irwin are around the area 7 or eight miles from there if you want to rent that we'll put some money toward it the church will all right so just let us know if you want to do that other than that we'll be staying in

in Hart on Saturday we'll be having meals so you probably the only thing you'll need to worry about is breakfast for yourself cuz the church will be paying for the lunch and the supper meals um for Saturday Friday night and Saturday for sure so we sure appreciate all of you that signed up that's going and if you haven't signed up yet please sign up because we got to get rooms we got to figure out all the logistics of getting them getting the people there so we appreciate all of you thank you for coming again God bless you let's bow our heads tell brother Chris you enjoyed the service you enjoyed he he filled my cup and I hope it overflowed into some of y'all amen yeah hallu we mean it let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you Lord for sending your servant that just poured out his heart Lord yes and we know if that heart is the heart of God it came from you and we know it was so we know that message was for us from you Lord straight from the throne and Lord each M each minister of this gospel that preaches the truth lord it's a it's you using them father and brother Chris just moved out of the way Lord and and you used him Lord to get the message to us because one man can't tell another man of Revelation it's got to be coming from you Lord and Lord I pray that you'd reveal the things if we if we didn't get it all this time may you reveal it Lord and we chew it over and over again and and uh look at the things that our brother said Lord and make it be something that that raises our faith up that raises us into an atmosphere Lord that we're not even used to I mean in a place Lord that that's as the scripture says Heavenly places and Lord the only place in Heavenly places is the word of God Lord I Thank you for all the ones that came this weekend Lord the ones that that provided U support for the food and all the things Lord we appreciate them and we thank you Lord that you've given us a great group of people to be around and be with Lord and I pray that you'd be with them one be with all the ones that are sick that couldn't get here the ones that are streaming in Lord in the in the church now in in um there in Cottonwood is going to be having
