[0:00] Oh one minute guys down game for two
[0:11] minutes sometimes time we have to study
[0:16] the book of Romans Romans we are now on
[0:20] chapters of Romans and let's see I got
[0:26] my pad back I got my OtterBox Defender
[0:31] [Music]
[0:42] [Applause]
[0:49] hey Dad
[0:51] all right so every book runs you got
[0:53] that done here we go so we are on the
[0:57] book of Romans we're on chapter six now
[1:00] remember this is the baptismal scripture
[1:03] this is one we use for baptism and I'm
[1:06] going to read it out of the Lexington
[1:08] but first we're going to read it here
[1:10] from and make a few comments now
[1:11] remember what Paul does he gives us a B
[1:17] give this day a lot of and what we did
[1:21] is we went from chapter 5 I'm gonna read
[1:24] chapter 5 let me read the last part of
[1:26] chapter 5 let's do that for chapter 5
[1:29] because remember man put the chapters
[1:32] then Paul is just writing a letter all
[1:35] right so now he's talking about the
[1:39] offense of one and all this verse 19
[1:42] brass by one man's disobedience many
[1:45] were made sinners so be it so by the
[1:47] obedience of one shall many be made
[1:49] righteous nicolette obedient moreover
[1:51] the law entered that the offense might
[1:53] abound alright so in other words what
[1:56] the law is a magnifier
[1:58] okay it brings you to a knowledge that
[2:02] your own alright but now it's not a lord
[2:06] over you okay
[2:08] you know because like I said before
[2:11] there's many laws on the books of the
[2:13] nation today that don't dick no I don't
[2:16] I'm not under that law it says don't
[2:19] drink and drive if you if you blow the
[2:22] point oh eight you go to jail whoa I'm
[2:24] never gonna drink and drive I'm never
[2:27] gonna drink so therefore I won't be
[2:29] drinking and driving so that law really
[2:30] I want to have to round I have to read
[2:32] that law several times that laws on the
[2:34] books but it's not effective to me they
[2:36] bring out that it's not effective so
[2:38] there's the law on here if you've never
[2:40] come into adultery that law it's not an
[2:42] effect of you isn't mrs. Tucker it's not
[2:46] even there all right so that's what what
[2:48] Christ did he came wanted to magnify the
[2:50] law but where sin abounded grace did
[2:54] much more abound remember grace was
[2:56] first grace was here first before there
[2:59] ever was Christ was the lamb slain
[3:02] before the foundation of the world so he
[3:04] was slain way before then even before
[3:07] Adam because remember by one man's
[3:09] disobedience many were made sinners then
[3:11] who - coming up Adam that's Adam I so by
[3:17] the obedience of one shall many be made
[3:18] righteous in Christ play moreover the
[3:20] law into the defense my development
[3:22] where sin abounded grace did much more
[3:23] abound that as sin has reigned unto
[3:27] death even so my grace reign through
[3:30] righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus
[3:32] Christ our Lord
[3:33] that's what we start stopped last Sunday
[3:36] so now we're on chapter six of Romans
[3:40] and as we've been talking before just to
[3:43] back up or give a little review for some
[3:47] that are here today then won't be here
[3:51] next week err but here last week so
[3:53] anyway so what we got I hope we've got
[3:57] in the background in just a minute
[3:58] we've got my circumcision and
[3:59] uncircumcision but we're going through
[4:01] the seals upstairs you know the world a
[4:03] force field so we see that grace coming
[4:07] up to the fifty we see really how grace
[4:09] comes in but now we also see that that
[4:12] the book of Romans speaks of
[4:14] justification sanctification and
[4:16] holy go all right because he talked
[4:19] about circumcision so now we're going to
[4:20] look and see though I want you to see
[4:22] this this is you said well this is the
[4:25] baptismal scripture this is not only the
[4:27] baptismal scripture this is your
[4:30] born-again script okay now you can be
[4:33] baptized you don't be born but you can't
[4:36] be dead and buried with Christ and not
[4:39] having about this one's all the guys
[4:40] right okay you can be baptized we put
[4:43] many a wet
[4:44] Oh many a dry centering them in the
[4:47] water and I hate this but you bring them
[4:49] out there just a wet Center you never
[4:51] see them the more they don't come back
[4:53] no more or either they go off somewhere
[4:56] else but if you're truly buried in
[4:59] Christ remember would come up to third
[5:02] seal dayit death that third seal you
[5:05] gotta be dated your old cousins got to
[5:07] be dead if the older husband's dead then
[5:09] what you bury him and walk in newness of
[5:14] life all right you got the newness of
[5:15] life coming back up that's what we want
[5:17] to read right here what shall we say
[5:19] then
[5:19] now remember verse of chapter five he's
[5:22] a continuation he's now he's answering
[5:24] his question what shall we say them
[5:26] shall we continue in sin that grace may
[5:29] abound in other words people we need to
[5:33] quit sinning because you think you got
[5:35] grace to cover everything and you're
[5:37] just your commitment necklace is what
[5:39] you're doing your knowing you shouldn't
[5:40] do it and you you're doing it anyway
[5:42] that's iniquity right now we stand every
[5:44] day as Christians we said but they're
[5:47] going east on me right here will we
[5:51] continue in sin are we going to continue
[5:53] to be an adulterer are we going to
[5:54] continue to be a lot of GD deed that
[5:58] grace may abound all grace can cover me
[6:00] you see that's that that's that once
[6:03] they know they say that was nothing
[6:05] that's what it is
[6:06] I said domination aligned a once they
[6:08] don't win say but once they'd always say
[6:10] then they say you got to go to judgment
[6:12] and up through the tribulation I'm to me
[6:13] I don't I'm gonna don't get like I said
[6:18] before I am so proud that if no other
[6:21] major doctrine in this whole message
[6:24] ever being revealed to me is that I
[6:26] don't have to
[6:27] to the judgment and I don't have to go
[6:29] through tribulation I don't have to
[6:31] stand before the judgment seat like
[6:34] everybody else and I do not have to go
[6:36] through the tribulation so to me back to
[6:38] things right there is nothing else
[6:40] coming that's good enough for me
[6:42] but nobody said what shall we question
[6:44] what shall we say then shall we continue
[6:45] in sin that grace may abound what the
[6:47] mark died forbid people wake up you know
[6:51] and he's talking to Roman so he's
[6:53] talking to Gentiles how shall we that
[6:57] are dead to sin live any longer therein
[7:01] right now listen we're not dead to stand
[7:04] in their body nobody don't sin right we
[7:07] stand in our spirit realm all right
[7:10] remember week our compartmentalised all
[7:12] that during the seal you do not use if
[7:15] you're a sinner you're sinning from your
[7:16] soul because your soul is born in sin
[7:19] shapen in iniquity it is that it has a
[7:22] nature attached to it after the age of
[7:24] accountability their thing Adamic old
[7:26] devil nature attached to your soul and
[7:30] it blackens that soul until God comes in
[7:32] or you just stay that way so you stand
[7:35] from the inward man you stand from the
[7:37] soul but now once that soul is saved
[7:39] once you're dead what the old man dies
[7:43] that nature detaches and guys Christ
[7:48] comes in the new husband right raises
[7:51] you up all right
[7:53] make sure you see you Carlos dot is so
[7:55] don't worry about that compartmentalize
[7:57] put that over there if you're born again
[7:59] today your soul cannot sin like John
[8:02] tell some perf God says you can't see
[8:04] him see remaineth in you the season I
[8:06] need your body it seems not in your
[8:07] experience the season your soul because
[8:10] the word goes down to the soul the man
[8:13] seasons to join tomorrow separate that's
[8:16] what we've done now you can't send it
[8:17] this does not sin this is a product of
[8:20] sin this is a product of mom and dad but
[8:24] this only does what the motivator tells
[8:26] it today
[8:27] okay so if you're born again in your
[8:29] soul if you're dead to sin live any
[8:35] longer therein we shouldn't be but in
[8:37] our spirit realm is where we sin is
[8:39] Christian's memory reason conscious
[8:42] affects an imagination take that home
[8:45] again and study and study that's my
[8:47] problem my memory my reasoning mind my
[8:55] conscious my affection which is not that
[9:00] affection is for your wife that
[9:03] affection is oh I love baseball I love
[9:07] you love Christ from your soul because
[9:10] that is love
[9:11] that's the capstone right here I love
[9:14] sure you will see the new birth down
[9:16] here but this is what capped it off but
[9:17] it's all of divine love comes remember
[9:19] what brother L strong about the brother
[9:20] brother the elements on them you receive
[9:22] the divine nature of God when you're
[9:24] born again down here in fact so you
[9:27] receive a divine nature why your own
[9:30] nature's day it so this is the soul now
[9:34] watch the soul then what do we do here
[9:36] where do these virtues come in they work
[9:38] to the outside memory reason conscious
[9:42] affects it make an exit so when we
[9:44] compartmentalize I don't worry about my
[9:45] flesh I just try to keep it fed Fran
[9:51] saying don't know don't do that
[9:53] I try to keep it fed more than it needs
[9:58] in case something happens and I can't
[10:00] eat for awhile but all this is it is a
[10:07] is a outward view got see taste feel
[10:11] smell in here what is it that's five
[10:13] that that's five endless if you're
[10:18] negating your soul you cannot sin you
[10:23] cannot sin brother Brown said remember
[10:25] original quote up there you can't stand
[10:27] enough if you're born again you can't
[10:30] send enough to go back the other
[10:31] direction
[10:32] I'm a but if you stand up a bunch we
[10:37] continuing sin then the old eggs are
[10:40] still in there the old the old my
[10:43] brother Graham called the old they call
[10:46] dynamic nature but the old thing that
[10:48] the root of evil the root of evil what
[10:52] root root is the very center of where
[10:55] all the nutrients come up front right
[10:58] the nutrients doesn't come from the tree
[11:00] itself to come to the root so the root
[11:02] of evil is still there so you still
[11:04] that's why you continue in sin because
[11:07] the roots still there okay the root of
[11:09] evil is still in the soul give that dead
[11:12] dead thus then moving out of the way you
[11:15] don't have to worry about that and then
[11:17] my brother Bell said let that soul start
[11:19] living out our problem is is we stop the
[11:22] flu though don't blame saying for a lot
[11:26] of things we do think we do Cherie but
[11:29] he can't work but remember me be
[11:31] satisfied he cannot work on yourself if
[11:34] your morning you you cannot can't touch
[11:36] it it's so fiery hot he can never touch
[11:39] it he has to let go but now in your
[11:43] spirit realm he can play with it all
[11:46] right you say all again you stay willing
[11:49] to understand maximize my skin since
[11:52] your skin don't say it you scan this guy
[11:55] here doesn't sin this is this is only a
[11:59] display of what's inside this is the
[12:01] only once keeps everything together
[12:03] all right so let me prove it to you
[12:06] before in the Old Testament if the
[12:11] priest didn't touch a woman remember say
[12:16] if you commit adultery will kill you in
[12:18] the Old Testament
[12:20] well those priests could have carnal
[12:22] sexual thoughts about them the women and
[12:25] they were fine as long as they didn't
[12:28] touch them but when Jesus come along he
[12:31] said don't worry about touching them he
[12:35] said if you have lusted in your heart
[12:40] you've committed adultery already not
[12:42] with this thing so there don't worry we
[12:45] know we know as human beings we ought to
[12:47] know even as even as born-again
[12:51] Christians that our carnality is in our
[12:53] spirit realm and then it displays the
[12:57] list to have the carnal acts that we
[12:58] knew which is fine bends undefiled we
[13:01] okay with that all right thanks good but
[13:04] we still do are motivated by that spirit
[13:07] realm memory reason conscience affection
[13:10] imagination
[13:11] okay so compartmentalize and
[13:14] compartmentalize that when you read Paul
[13:16] because Paul's telling us shall we
[13:18] contend sin that grace may abound god
[13:20] forbid
[13:21] how shall we that our dad that stamp all
[13:24] sin how are we then are dead to sin live
[13:26] it over here you're dead to sin living
[13:30] you over there in he's telling the
[13:33] people he says this when he's trying to
[13:34] tell them to look if you born again
[13:36] hello
[13:38] if you born again
[13:45] if you're born again you know I'm gonna
[13:47] sit in your soul but you still have
[13:49] problems look no you know that so many
[13:51] of us were baptized into Jesus Christ
[13:53] were baptized into his death therefore
[13:58] we are buried with him by baptism into
[14:01] death not naturally okay remember the
[14:07] dead Christ shall rise first if you're
[14:10] not dead now he ain't talking about the
[14:12] dead out there in the team know if
[14:15] you're dead in Christ now right you'll
[14:17] rise first the dead in Christ shall rise
[14:20] first therefore we are buried with him
[14:22] by baptism into death that like as
[14:26] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[14:28] the glory of the Father even so we also
[14:30] should walk in newness of life and of
[14:36] life remember I preached a sermon on
[14:38] going over not to lives to life it's to
[14:42] life that we have to deal with our view
[14:43] in life in our spiritual life all right
[14:46] for if we have been planted together
[14:51] planning together in the likeness of his
[14:55] death we shall be also in the likeness
[14:58] of his resurrection knowing this that
[15:02] our old man is crucified now when they
[15:06] put you across and crucify you you die
[15:08] there's never been anybody ever come
[15:10] down home across it was life they're all
[15:12] they're all deceased alright we shall
[15:18] also be in the likeness of his
[15:20] resurrection
[15:21] watch this knowing this that our old man
[15:26] is crucified with him that the body of
[15:30] sin that's not this so this is not
[15:32] destroyed when you're born again the
[15:35] body of sin you don't have two bodies
[15:40] inside of you but you have a nature
[15:41] attached to you that makes your body do
[15:43] things I mean just real simple if you'll
[15:46] compartmentalize it it makes your
[15:48] understand what's going on here that we
[15:51] have strict consent in our spirit realm
[15:54] can't touch the soul it's done it's
[15:57] finished listen it's sitting in heavenly
[15:58] places it's actually in another
[16:00] dimension I mean we're not sitting in
[16:05] heaven places we're sitting it's poking
[16:06] we're Church today but our soul by the
[16:09] Bible is still in heavenly places in
[16:12] Christ Jesus so we have been raised up
[16:14] by resurrected right see that's one of
[16:18] the two people were preaching philip
[16:20] thygesen jimenez was preaching the pulse
[16:22] and the resurrection and already come
[16:23] close what's he doing he's telling them
[16:25] we're being resurrected we're being
[16:27] brought up we're sitting in heavenly
[16:29] places they were listening to him preach
[16:31] just like people do they listen that's
[16:33] the same demon that comes up with all
[16:35] these strange doctrines they hear what
[16:37] brother Ram preaches and they go well
[16:39] they go pretty strand doctrine same time
[16:40] well brother Branham said well they said
[16:43] well Paulo said we were resurrected they
[16:46] said the resurrection snowpacks no Paul
[16:48] didn't say the resurrection at them fast
[16:50] he said we were resurrected sitting in
[16:53] heavenly places but they took that
[16:55] doctrine and you know what if they did
[16:56] they thought of me so much to leave and
[16:58] when Paul rebuked them they said we're
[17:01] right so rebel Paul had turned over to
[17:04] the devil they were so right till the
[17:08] person they got the docked him from came
[17:10] to him and said I'm not saying that and
[17:12] they said well yeah they would keep them
[17:13] we're going we're gonna keep this
[17:15] revelation we're going to teach this
[17:16] revelation you know that happens all
[17:20] over the country even in Jamaica
[17:21] activity same demon different name
[17:25] knowing this that our old man is
[17:27] crucified with him that the body of sin
[17:31] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[17:34] should not serve sin for he that is dead
[17:40] member we would agree marriage and
[17:42] divorce a little bit on the third seal
[17:44] if your whole husband is dead you're
[17:47] free to marry you're free to marry you
[17:50] have no law restriction if your
[17:52] husband's dead except that you may
[17:54] believe but only in Christ is what the
[17:56] Bible says so now in the spiritual acts
[17:59] that if he that is dead it's free from
[18:02] sin no look we're not there physically
[18:03] do you know what he's talking about
[18:04] that old nature is dead we're free from
[18:08] sin that's what you and I have to
[18:11] realize because it is a two-fold thing
[18:14] we live every day and we stand every day
[18:16] right but we don't stand on our soul our
[18:19] soul is just as perfect as God is it's
[18:22] already resurrected this already took
[18:24] the money change because we have a body
[18:29] right here the body of sin but if it's
[18:34] dead and destroyed look we're going to
[18:37] read them down here maybe and we get to
[18:39] it
[18:40] excuse me you can't accuse a dead man
[18:44] I mean anything we were justified by the
[18:51] death of Christ you can't blame us hello
[18:56] somebody get that one of these days we
[18:58] will take a body changed so I changes
[19:01] what already in here that's right so
[19:03] it's not coming from me I have somewhere
[19:05] it's coming from right here all right
[19:07] for he that is dead it's freed from sin
[19:11] now if we be dead with Christ we believe
[19:14] that we don't you shall live with him
[19:16] now that's eternal life we live with him
[19:19] all right knowing that Christ being
[19:21] raised from the dead died no more he
[19:25] didn't have to go be dead again that's
[19:26] right even we were listening to the
[19:29] upstairs about Roy Branham indicted this
[19:33] generation for the second crucifixion
[19:35] the crowd what they put him on a cross
[19:37] and kill me by what by their doctrine
[19:40] okay what the inside person you can't be
[19:45] alive with Christ on this in the soul
[19:48] and be lost
[19:49] that's right or do what they were
[19:51] talking about doing he brother Graham
[19:53] didn't die to Christian he would indict
[19:56] in the denominational spirit of the
[19:58] whole
[19:59] right what they did they killed Christ
[20:01] that's why Christ had to come off of the
[20:02] mountain in Matthew and said tell this
[20:06] vision of no one to what the Son of Man
[20:08] be risen again from the dead he was
[20:11] killed in dirt and dive around here and
[20:13] raised but down to the church ages they
[20:16] killed him again and today the Son of
[20:19] Man is written in me and you yes these
[20:22] work what's the word made flesh knowing
[20:31] that Christ will yeah knowing that
[20:33] Christ being raised from the dead
[20:35] no more deaths have no more dominion
[20:39] over him now we're dead buried in Christ
[20:42] that's that's no more dominion over now
[20:47] what we've got to do is compartmentalize
[20:49] then we got to take down our soul and
[20:51] start into our spirit round get our
[20:53] spirit realm to believe that right that
[20:56] those who he's justified is already
[20:57] glorified and then all of a sudden the
[20:59] body is going to change you're not going
[21:03] to eat right you know work out you're
[21:06] not going to get this thing ready for
[21:07] our body saying no no I'm sure I Abraham
[21:15] when he met Mel Kennedy before he got
[21:18] his body chained he probably had to give
[21:21] up I have a chair like this okay
[21:23] and had to be helped down set of stairs
[21:28] and he was 99 not 50 but I'm sure that
[21:35] he wasn't feeling very spry the day
[21:38] before okay
[21:40] but that next morning he got a body gen4
[21:44] hand that he died he died understand
[21:47] once but in that he liveth he liveth
[21:50] unto God likewise he's talking to you
[21:55] them likewise reckon ye also yourselves
[21:58] to be dead indeed unto sin but alive
[22:02] unto God to Jesus
[22:05] let not stand therefore reign in your
[22:09] mortal body it says in not home this is
[22:17] more money so it's in your mortal body
[22:20] because remember this thing doesn't sin
[22:23] it's a product of sin yes but it does
[22:26] not send this this man you're looking at
[22:29] today used to hold things in his hand
[22:33] that was not good beer all kind of stuff
[22:37] you can do some kind of you know that
[22:40] one finger wave and all that stuff but
[22:42] we got cleaned me up he didn't give me a
[22:44] new flesh nobody cleaned up the flesh I
[22:47] got you know what you've done you clean
[22:48] them the inside man the inside man the
[22:50] outside man just reacted to the inside
[22:51] of man
[22:53] let not sin therefore reign in your
[22:56] mortal body that you should obey it in
[22:58] the lusts thereof now you know let's
[23:00] move on you know better than that don't
[23:04] loose with your body where's it start
[23:08] right memory reasoning conscience
[23:12] effective the madness comes remember
[23:15] there's only one sense in the soul
[23:16] flaker doubt favorite out that's it all
[23:21] right but now you come out the next room
[23:22] you've got five senses that Satan can
[23:24] come in this way and God's trying to
[23:26] work his way out this way they meet that
[23:27] battleground let not sin therefore reign
[23:30] in your mortal body that you should obey
[23:32] it in the lusts thereof
[23:33] neither yield ye your members as
[23:36] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin
[23:39] but yield yourself unto God as those
[23:42] that are alive from the dead and your
[23:46] members as instruments of righteousness
[23:48] unto God look for sin shall not have
[23:52] dominion over you nice of I'm telling
[23:56] you this you gotta believe what the
[23:58] Bible already wrote for sin shall not
[24:01] have dominion over you for ye are not
[24:04] under the law but under grace
[24:07] but let a minute pulse is now what then
[24:11] shall we sin because we are not under
[24:14] the law but under grace
[24:15] god forbid no you not that to whom ye
[24:19] yield yourselves servants to obey his
[24:22] servants ye are to whom you obey
[24:26] I let Satan working my memories in
[24:30] constant imagination and all that stuff
[24:32] I let him do that you do that but we
[24:37] should yield ourselves to God more then
[24:42] he have the preeminence and then even
[24:45] though Satan comes you just because
[24:48] remember save came to Jesus talk to him
[24:54] tempted him with what external thing
[24:58] things you can see you know all the
[25:00] things like that be him being God
[25:03] Almighty saying didn't have a problem
[25:04] talking to it so don't you think he's
[25:06] got a problem talking to you right for
[25:10] sin shall not have dominion over you for
[25:12] you are not under the law but under
[25:13] grace what then shall we sin because we
[25:14] are not under the law but under grace
[25:17] god forbid no United to whom ye yield
[25:20] yourselves servants to obey his servants
[25:22] ye are to whom you obey whether of sin
[25:25] unto death or of obedience unto
[25:28] righteousness but God be thanked that we
[25:31] are the servant look but God be thanked
[25:36] that ye were the servants of sin but ye
[25:42] have obeyed from the heart that form of
[25:47] doctrine which was delivered you being
[25:51] then made free from sin you become the
[25:55] servants of righteousness I like that
[25:59] alright now what I'm going to do is I'm
[26:01] going to go back and read it out of the
[26:04] Greek lexicon you
[26:05] see a little bit clearer what Paul's
[26:07] talking all right great what then shall
[26:11] we say all week to continue in sin that
[26:14] favor man well sorry
[26:19] by no means now shall we who have died
[26:22] by sin live any longer in it pretty
[26:27] blunt or are you ignorant that as many
[26:32] as have been on green ones they are are
[26:35] you ignorant that as many as have been
[26:37] immersed in the Christ have been
[26:39] immersed into his death verse 3 verse 4
[26:43] we have therefore been entombed with him
[26:47] by the immersion into that death that as
[26:50] Christ was raised from the dead by the
[26:52] glory of the father so also we should
[26:54] walk in a new life verse 5 for him we
[27:02] have been planted together in the
[27:04] likeness of his death certainly we shall
[27:07] be also in doubt of his resurrection
[27:09] knowing this that our old man was
[27:11] crucified with him so that the body of
[27:13] sin may be rendered powerless I like
[27:17] that may be rendered powerless that we
[27:23] may no longer be enslaved to sin because
[27:26] you were slaves simply when you we know
[27:28] that verse 7 for he who died listen to
[27:34] this for he who died has been justified
[27:39] from sin because you can't accuse the
[27:44] dead man of anything
[27:47] you can go out in the graveyard and and
[27:50] get daddy
[27:51] my daddy's daddy died see 70 something
[27:53] years ago and you can't accuse him of
[27:56] robbing by yesterday they don't care
[27:58] what you did
[27:58] you can acuity you walk out then you can
[28:01] deed them up out of the grave a look at
[28:03] it face to face and see you did and if
[28:07] you're dead if we're dead in Christ
[28:11] we're we have people for he who died has
[28:14] been justified from sin and if we died
[28:17] with Christ we believe that we shall
[28:20] also live with him that's verse 8 verse
[28:22] 9
[28:23] knowing that Christ having been raised
[28:25] from the dead dies no more death no
[28:27] longer lords over him that's verse 9
[28:33] verse 10 for the death which he died he
[28:39] died if I sent one though words he died
[28:41] for our sin he died of the perpetuation
[28:45] that took all of our sins away he died
[28:50] my sin once but the life which he lives
[28:52] he lives by God verse 10 verse 11 thus
[28:56] also do you account yourself dead indeed
[28:59] by sin but living by God and in the
[29:02] anointed Jesus I like that dude which is
[29:06] this record
[29:07] verse 11 verse 12 let not sin therefore
[29:11] reign in your mortal body in order to
[29:14] obey its desired excuse me verse 13 nor
[29:18] present remembers to sin as instruments
[29:21] of iniquity but present yourself to God
[29:24] as if alive from the dead so that's what
[29:27] you are you are alive from the dead
[29:29] alive from the dead and your members to
[29:34] God as instruments of righteousness for
[29:36] 14
[29:42] we're fourteen four since you're not
[29:44] Lord over you for ye are not under law
[29:48] but under favor verse fifteen what then
[29:53] should we send because we are not under
[29:56] the law but under favor by no means
[29:59] verse 16 do you not know that to whom
[30:03] you present yourself slaves for
[30:05] obedience his slaves you are to whom you
[30:10] are obedient try explain to them where
[30:13] their ups and to death or of obedience
[30:15] to righteousness verse 17 but thanks to
[30:19] God that though you were slaves of sin
[30:22] yet you obeyed from the heart that mould
[30:26] of instruction into which you were
[30:29] delivered mold would be what body right
[30:35] right that doctrine which was delivered
[30:38] unto you verse 18 and having been
[30:43] emancipated from sin what set free
[30:48] emancipation is that free
[30:49] I remember brother Keith preaching on
[30:52] emancipation right
[30:54] and having been emancipated from sin you
[30:58] become subservient to righteousness
[31:02] I speak humanly because of the weakness
[31:05] of your flesh I didn't when we read
[31:09] nineteen all the way over here 423 doing
[31:11] things with them for as you present your
[31:14] members enslaved to the impurity
[31:20] and iniquity so now present your members
[31:23] bound to righteousness for a while that
[31:27] said the original says for
[31:28] sanctification so we went through a
[31:31] justification we've gone through
[31:33] sanctification minded to me once you see
[31:36] once you see the the total plan of
[31:39] redemption you see Redemption and in
[31:41] Reverse in every scripture when the seal
[31:43] is open and you see that God has done
[31:45] all this forth it truly makes it a brand
[31:47] new book verse 24 when we were slaves of
[31:53] sin you were free as the righteousness
[31:57] did you can't be you can't be serving it
[32:00] to both okay can't be serving at the
[32:03] boat look at 21 what fruit therefore had
[32:09] you at that time in things of which you
[32:12] are now ashamed for the end of those
[32:16] things is death natural I'm especially
[32:22] dead but it will take you to upgrade
[32:24] when then you go to welcome judgment but
[32:27] now having being emancipated from sin
[32:31] and having become bound to God you have
[32:36] your fruit and sanctification and the
[32:38] end listen and the end and knowing a
[32:42] known young life or each for everlasting
[32:44] life hey i ôm I am life for the wages of
[32:49] sin is death but the gracious gift of
[32:53] God is anointed a I am i have knowing
[32:58] life by the anointed Jesus our Lord
[33:01] so that hold that chapter there tells us
[33:05] something that I and something's gonna
[33:08] live the only way you can be dead to sin
[33:12] and never and never come back once you
[33:17] cross that line
[33:21] but you can't stand enough to be loved
[33:24] if you're born again so if we get born
[33:28] again then we've stayed that it doesn't
[33:30] take our troubles away I mean we still
[33:34] have laws that we have to deal with I
[33:36] mean there's still things that we have
[33:37] to be careful because you got your
[33:40] memory reasoning concepts based
[33:41] imagination which is not born again
[33:43] which is not covered by the Holy Ghost
[33:47] only those the thing you're so and then
[33:49] he's trying to get that he's trying to
[33:51] cover it he's trying to get you to what
[33:52] grow up in the stature of a perfect man
[33:55] right because you do get the Holy Ghost
[33:57] when you get the Holy Ghost you get
[33:58] everything you need for your journey the
[34:00] problem is the problem is is we try to I
[34:06] don't say strangle but I guess sometimes
[34:09] you can say strangle and not let the
[34:11] Holy Ghost work we did that and then we
[34:14] must yield ourselves members to Christ
[34:16] yield our members for Christ and and
[34:21] stop worry about your soul if you're
[34:22] born again don't worry about that
[34:24] because listen they'll take care of
[34:25] itself
[34:26] my biggest problem one more time it's my
[34:29] memory when I think what I remember
[34:32] Satan reminds me what I did god don't
[34:34] remind me what you did but you know what
[34:36] he can't even remember what sins are you
[34:42] talking about another song what's it and
[34:45] that's true you remember I told you you
[34:48] know several years ago I'm that's my
[34:50] place that something happened that was
[34:51] not good that I didn't that's the one
[34:53] I'm so sorry for that and you know I'm
[34:55] like you idiot even though these are the
[34:59] entities he's standing right there where
[35:00] he going me coming now he said he'd
[35:04] forget it and when he said he'd forget
[35:07] it anyway you want picture it the only
[35:12] way we can as humans apply it would be
[35:16] what the song what the Prophet said he
[35:18] puts it in the Sea of God's
[35:20] forgetfulness for me never to be
[35:22] remembered again so he quit so don't
[35:27] don't you see next I probably keep going
[35:30] back to the old person's on well I'm
[35:31] sorry for all there
[35:37] if you're born in your souls right gods
[35:43] want to work on that thing to bring it
[35:44] out he's not one to he's not want us to
[35:51] say that's our problem
[35:52] do you understand me that's our problem
[35:53] we hashed up all the old things we did
[35:56] and we get condemned in our self when
[36:02] Christ is sitting there going you're
[36:07] telling me this new thing that I don't
[36:08] know nothing about you know what you
[36:12] said Jack I'm not forgot that now you
[36:20] need to forget it right I mean really
[36:24] yeah it always boils down
[36:29] it's all it's all choice make sure you
[36:33] watch what Paul was talking about yield
[36:36] hoodoos the new hoodoos who lose the
[36:38] ilding who don't know who does the yell
[36:41] me you do you do doc don't know yielding
[36:49] he is who here we either yield out
[36:53] something fine
[36:54] are you myself little devil that's not
[36:57] fair yielding their self to the devil
[36:58] you know he don't yield you and I yield
[37:02] we yield one way there so I feel right
[37:06] so all right it's time to go please stop
[37:09] Lord bless you we enjoy the word today
