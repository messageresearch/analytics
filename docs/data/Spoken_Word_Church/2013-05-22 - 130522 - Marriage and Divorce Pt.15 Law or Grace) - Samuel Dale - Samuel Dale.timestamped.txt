[2:56] coming up this weekend it's doing good
[2:59] amen enjoyed this last weekend and pray
[3:02] that the Lord blessed you and helped you
[3:05] in in understanding amen Romans 7 dear
[3:09] heavenly father we thank you Lord for
[3:11] this night and your love unto us thank
[3:14] you for Calvary thank you for you thank
[3:17] you for all things and Lord we know that
[3:20] they come to us freely we don't have to
[3:23] pay anything for it we just have to
[3:25] receive it we ask you now to just have
[3:27] your way and let your love and
[3:29] manifestation and Grace be with each one
[3:31] of us tonight as we read about you and
[3:34] talk about you then you come and speak
[3:36] to our hearts and our lives remember the
[3:38] sick among us Lord the many many
[3:40] different things many
[3:42] sicknesses you said you sent your word
[3:44] and healed us so we believe you sent
[3:46] your word now we believe that the
[3:49] manifestation of the healings and things
[3:51] will also come into
[3:53] reality because we love you and we thank
[3:55] you forgive our sins cleanse us and keep
[3:58] us Lord in Jes Jesus name
[4:01] amen Romans
[4:09] 7 know ye not brethren for I speak to
[4:12] them that know the law how the law hath
[4:16] dominion over a man as long as he liveth
[4:19] now we won't get to that tonight what we
[4:21] want to do is just basically get in to
[4:25] uh what is the law and you know reality
[4:29] and coming down down but then you just
[4:31] think on that thing you know think on
[4:33] the point we we want to say to the women
[4:35] or go to the next verse you know but
[4:37] remember it starts off by
[4:40] saying and when it's saying that that
[4:42] word man there is not signifying just
[4:46] singular that the man's the only one
[4:48] that needs to be dead to the law it's
[4:51] meaning mankind it's meaning men women
[4:54] and everything you know in doing all
[4:56] right so know you not brethren for I
[4:58] speak to them that know the law and that
[5:01] the law hath dominion over man as long
[5:03] as he liveth for the woman which hath an
[5:05] husband is bound by the law to her
[5:07] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[5:11] husband be dead she is loose from the
[5:12] law of her husband so then while her
[5:15] husband liveth she then so then if while
[5:18] her husband liveth she be married to
[5:21] another man she shall be called an
[5:23] adulterous but if her husband be dead
[5:25] she is free from that law so that she is
[5:28] no adulterous though she be married to
[5:30] another man wherefor my brethren you
[5:34] also are become dead to the law now
[5:37] remember verse
[5:39] one dead to the law by the body of
[5:41] Christ that you should be married to
[5:43] another even to him who is raised from
[5:45] the dead that we should bring forth
[5:48] fruit unto God for when we were in the
[5:51] flesh the Motions of sin which were by
[5:53] the law did work in our members to bring
[5:56] forth fruit unto death but now we are
[5:59] delivered from the law that being dead
[6:02] wherein we were held that we should
[6:05] serve in the newness of spirit and not
[6:07] in the oldness of the letter you may be
[6:11] seated the Lord add his Blessing to the
[6:13] reading of the word now as I said we
[6:16] will be still speaking and we'll put the
[6:18] number wise this is part 15 on marriage
[6:20] and divorce and we'll still tie it
[6:23] together to where that when they put it
[6:25] together and they they like to have it
[6:27] in a series point to where that so many
[6:29] numbers and then they'll put it in a
[6:31] group and and offer it to anyone that
[6:33] wants to hear uh you know our thoughts
[6:36] on marriage and divorce and
[6:38] thing but I think it's time to move on
[6:41] up a little
[6:43] further in where we're at and uh you
[6:48] know to be able to understand because
[6:50] like sister Gail said if not then we're
[6:52] going to be around here a long time and
[6:54] a lot of us is getting too old to be
[6:56] around here a long time so I'm wanting
[6:59] things to get underway aren't you and
[7:01] that's uh you know but we we need it all
[7:04] right now I want to back up into what we
[7:07] were talking Sunday afternoon because I
[7:10] pray that you will take that message and
[7:14] and listen to it over and over and over
[7:18] and and you know U maybe get what I'm
[7:21] talking about that's right cuz I put
[7:23] something in there Sunday afternoon that
[7:26] I have studied upon for for many years
[7:30] but yet not fully clear in my own self
[7:33] as to how to express it you know to open
[7:37] up and speak about it and to to say
[7:39] things but to see that why brother
[7:42] brandom would talking about uh on
[7:46] especially the invisible Union that a
[7:48] woman can be forgiven right but said she
[7:51] can never be justified in this life
[7:54] right all right then we want to go to
[7:58] but I thought the grace of marriage and
[8:01] divorce Justified us well now I I want
[8:04] that thought to be brought to me from
[8:06] Brother Brandon's message of marriage
[8:07] and divorce because to my understanding
[8:09] that's why I kept saying that Sunday
[8:11] afternoon he said go on as you are right
[8:15] yes sir
[8:16] sure we were forgiven right amen but if
[8:21] you're saying going as you are you know
[8:24] that means that under a situation of
[8:27] life and he said it y he said ' we can't
[8:30] take these things and break them down
[8:33] you remember right after he made that
[8:35] statement he said we can't do that he
[8:37] said so just don't try to do this that
[8:39] just go on as you are and leave it alone
[8:42] now as I said he didn't mean if you went
[8:44] there married to three women you went
[8:46] home with three women he didn't say that
[8:48] or he wouldn't have been given the grace
[8:50] or the porn of the thought or God
[8:52] wouldn't have been speaking through him
[8:54] all right now but yet when you get to
[8:57] the invisible Union you hear him
[8:58] speaking of of how that justified
[9:03] means as though you never done
[9:07] it you done it he guilty then you're
[9:10] forgiven you're Justified then you go on
[9:13] in through the message and you'll find
[9:14] out
[9:15] that it's as though you never done it
[9:20] right but then he finishes the message
[9:22] up by saying the real you never done it
[9:24] that's right all right so then that way
[9:26] we've got these things to go forward
[9:28] into to get a better understanding and I
[9:31] I just ask you to to go through that
[9:34] this past Sunday's afternoon's
[9:37] message and just ponder over the
[9:40] thoughts of what was said and you know
[9:43] maybe it will open up some things to
[9:46] where we can
[9:47] understand
[9:51] now Paul
[9:54] says that
[10:00] he's illustrating he's speaking of
[10:03] marriage and
[10:05] divorce but he's using that as an
[10:08] illustration right to speak on Law and
[10:11] Grace now we as I said Sunday afternoon
[10:14] we turned it around right we were saying
[10:18] that
[10:20] everything all the way down to the end
[10:23] was pointing to the grace of marriage
[10:25] and divorce for our natural things I I
[10:27] don't agree with that I'm sorry
[10:31] we will get to it in the message more
[10:33] Sunday you got to come through the new
[10:36] birth amen all right see how that
[10:40] husband is dead you got to come through
[10:42] the grace of marriage and divorce and
[10:44] see that husband is dead then you can
[10:47] talk about what Paul is speaking of and
[10:51] the the thing brother Randon was
[10:52] speaking of on the invisible Union so
[10:54] we'll have to take it and break it down
[10:56] and we just keep going on it for a while
[10:58] and you know and I hope you don't do
[11:00] like one brother did about us on a
[11:02] certain topic and we you know he got
[11:06] kind of irritated and he stomped his
[11:08] foot a few times up here and said get
[11:10] off of this that and go on you know well
[11:13] I hope you don't say that about I drag a
[11:16] lot of times I
[11:18] think but if I preach really what I see
[11:22] you know we would be a year or two on
[11:25] this one
[11:26] point I mean I would have no problem
[11:28] preaching at you ought to know that by
[11:30] now if I can
[11:31] preach 95 to 100 sermons off of one
[11:34] thought you ought not have any trouble
[11:36] thinking about that it could be done I'm
[11:39] trying to shorten it instead of bringing
[11:41] out I'm trying to cut back instead of
[11:43] because I'm preaching to people here
[11:45] that are are seasoned in the gospel and
[11:48] know what we've already already taught
[11:50] so I don't have to teach it over in
[11:52] every service I can just hit it go on go
[11:54] on just keep going all right but now
[11:59] brother brandham I gave them to you
[12:01] there Sunday where brother brandham on
[12:03] paragraph 35 of the invisible Union you
[12:05] can go ahead and pull that up cuz I want
[12:07] these to stay with you I want these
[12:10] quotes to stay with
[12:12] you of what he's
[12:15] saying you know and and we gave these
[12:18] Sunday but I want to give them over
[12:19] again I want them I want them to stay
[12:20] with you I want them to to embed into
[12:22] your uh thinking ability and put it all
[12:25] together and then you'll see when we
[12:27] begin to to speak more on the things
[12:31] that you'll see it just going right back
[12:32] to that same quote all right so look
[12:35] what he's saying on paragraph 35 of the
[12:37] invisible
[12:39] Union Paul here is given an illustration
[12:41] in our scripture about the law and
[12:45] Grace and illustrating it like marriage
[12:48] and divorce see we want to make the
[12:50] marriage and divorce the height instead
[12:52] of no if you're illustrating with
[12:54] something you're typing with it Paul is
[12:57] typing with marriage and divorce y to
[13:00] show us about law and Grace amen all
[13:04] right see we we want to turn that around
[13:07] one sister came out after the service
[13:09] over she said I'm glad you said that she
[13:11] said because that's what I believed said
[13:13] I believed in other words I'll I'll
[13:15] phrase my own words onto the end of it
[13:17] not hers see a lot of people thinks that
[13:19] we can get these old bodies straightened
[13:21] out if we can find some kind of a
[13:23] gimmick or a way or a a something you
[13:27] know that we can figure out the these
[13:29] old bodies we're going to be ready to
[13:31] get out of here well I think we're
[13:34] dealing with the wrong end you know I
[13:37] think we're to deal with the inward man
[13:40] that's right and then the outer man will
[13:42] come into subjection to the inward man
[13:44] that's right all right now see so Paul
[13:48] is what he's illustrating it like
[13:51] marriage and divorce these passages very
[13:52] sell preach on because it more or less
[13:54] pertains to like marriage and divorce
[13:57] but it also pertains to a greater port
[13:59] of marriage and divorce you remember
[14:02] what I brought out greater portion you
[14:04] got a portion that's a small amount or
[14:06] just a start but a greater
[14:11] portion you're Justified that's a
[14:13] portion of the Holy Ghost Sanctified
[14:15] that's a portion of the Holy Ghost but
[14:17] the baptism is the Holy Ghost so it's a
[14:20] greater portion see something keeps
[14:22] going on and on and on and on and
[14:23] climbing higher and higher all right
[14:26] said but it also pertains to a greater
[14:29] no marriage and
[14:30] divorce of how that he's trying to set
[14:33] in order here that we as a church can no
[14:37] more be married to the world and to
[14:39] Christ at the same time and would be
[14:41] legal and lawful about it than it can be
[14:44] for a woman to be living with a husband
[14:46] while she's got a living husband he said
[14:49] I have my own thoughts on those things
[14:51] and he said it unfolds one of the great
[14:53] mysteries of Prophecy remember the
[14:56] entire Bible right would speak
[14:59] of the end time but in the end time the
[15:03] truth would come forth look at the next
[15:07] quote paragraph
[15:11] 43 the illustration here showing the
[15:15] relationship he's not showing the
[15:17] relationship Paul is not showing the
[15:19] relationship of a man and a wife or
[15:21] whatever this that and the other he's
[15:23] using that to show the relationship
[15:26] between Christ and the bride right
[15:30] are you following
[15:32] me showing the relationship of bride to
[15:35] Christ the elect lady and how she was to
[15:37] be brought to him where she would come
[15:40] from and how that she would be brought
[15:41] to him now when we get on down into the
[15:44] message you'll see that that's what's
[15:46] taking place we are being brought to him
[15:51] all right
[15:53] amen is illustrated by a woman which a
[15:56] woman is always the type of the church
[15:58] because the church church is considered
[15:59] a bride a bride and she is the Bride of
[16:01] the Lord Jesus Christ the son of God go
[16:03] on to the next from paragraph 81 I want
[16:05] you to get these and just keep keep
[16:08] reading them over and talking
[16:10] about an illustration or an you know
[16:14] illustrating it showing it excuse me
[16:17] showing it by examples
[16:20] amen see then you'll see the whole Bible
[16:23] his types and shadows brother random was
[16:26] the greatest typologist that's ever been
[16:29] because he would always using something
[16:31] to type it with some telling a story all
[16:35] of those long
[16:36] stories of the armor Meat Packing
[16:40] Company and guy you know and the the
[16:42] little girl and the wash woman and all
[16:44] that you hear them
[16:46] about 400 times probably in the the
[16:51] message but one of these days that'll
[16:53] don't on you what he's talking about
[16:55] he's talking about Christ in the
[16:57] church right
[16:59] that's just illustrating it see and
[17:02] watch he says the woman he's using typ
[17:05] in it paragraph 81 we find that her body
[17:08] is the bedding grounds and therefore it
[17:10] is a sacred trust not to defile that now
[17:13] I'm speaking now bringing this to an
[17:15] illustration to show you where the
[17:16] church
[17:17] stands I'm not speaking of you women
[17:20] whatever you are that's between you and
[17:21] God or you men but I'm speaking of the
[17:24] church and Christ all right speaking of
[17:28] Christ and the
[17:32] church showing
[17:34] us
[17:36] that no matter what we deal
[17:40] with that our old husband has got to be
[17:43] dead
[17:48] amen now if he's not dead and we marry
[17:51] again what if we
[17:53] done y amen and I I want to say this and
[17:57] I'll say it over and over
[17:59] what about the prophet preaching the
[18:01] invisible
[18:02] Union to the people that are in that
[18:04] church the day he was preaching
[18:07] it and raking down so
[18:11] hard about
[18:14] denominationalism and how that old
[18:16] husband must be
[18:19] dead but how many people got up and
[18:22] walked out and said I'm not going to
[18:24] this church no more
[18:29] that's right are you
[18:31] understand but see it wasn't the time
[18:34] right amen and it might not have been
[18:36] the people either but it wasn't the time
[18:39] to
[18:41] understand now I'm saying it this way
[18:43] and trying my best to say it and I'll
[18:45] keep saying it I'm not saying those
[18:47] people were not born again that's
[18:50] right there's probably a lot in the
[18:52] building there that day was born again
[18:54] but you know brother brandham was
[18:55] preaching around the world against
[18:57] denominationalism
[18:59] right but he says I have no word attend
[19:01] them
[19:05] to but yet you can pull out you can
[19:07] never enter the door of a denominational
[19:10] church and be just as organized and
[19:13] denominated as anybody that's born and
[19:16] die and dies in there you
[19:22] know because denominationalism is just a
[19:25] manifestation of a spirit right
[19:29] organization is the first stage then it
[19:32] goes into Den to
[19:35] denominationalism all right that's why
[19:37] you don't see the people of this message
[19:39] putting a sign out in front William
[19:41] brandham Tabernacle they've got you know
[19:44] one there in Jeffersonville but that's
[19:46] you know but not you
[19:48] know you don't see that why because that
[19:50] would be stamping a a head of saying
[19:53] we're a
[19:55] denomination and then if you did and you
[19:57] stamped it out there and said we're we
[19:59] believe everything William Brown said
[20:01] then somebody walk up to him and say
[20:03] y'all teach two souls and two Lords and
[20:07] all these other doctrines and i' take
[20:10] the sign off the front yeah because you
[20:12] don't believe what the man
[20:14] said but we'll get to this and go over
[20:17] it and over and over
[20:19] it but the main thought in mind is one
[20:26] thing for us to be born again I'll go
[20:28] over this Sunday because this is where
[20:30] I'll start on it but I want us to lay it
[20:31] down for you to think on for us to be
[20:34] born again that old husband must be dead
[20:37] amen right your old adamic nature right
[20:41] all
[20:43] right and in the marriage and divorce
[20:47] situation that old husband must be
[20:51] dead right then in the invisible
[20:54] invisible Union that old denominational
[20:56] husband must be dead that's right
[20:59] amen for us to be married to Christ amen
[21:03] and like I said you could have said to
[21:04] those people that day sitting there you
[21:06] could say to a lot of people today and
[21:08] they say I was sitting there when he
[21:10] preached
[21:11] it so well did you get out of organized
[21:14] relig well about 20 years later I begin
[21:17] to think about
[21:21] it you know I'm telling the
[21:24] truth but I think on it
[21:29] look at paragraph 56 invisible
[21:32] union now remember the prophet of God
[21:35] said I'm trying to show you where the
[21:36] church stands that's what we just read
[21:39] paragraph
[21:40] 81 where the church
[21:43] stands so what does he say here the
[21:46] prophet Paul here is saying that a woman
[21:49] cannot remarry until her first husband
[21:51] is you I'm going to show you a
[21:53] denomination I'm going to show you a
[21:55] denomination an organization
[21:59] now this is how simple we're going to
[22:00] have to break it down to to see what it
[22:02] really
[22:03] is you know that there's a lot of people
[22:05] in the message lamb bash brother
[22:07] brandham for saying Paul was a
[22:13] Prophet come on a lot of people
[22:17] say Paul would no Prophet they said it
[22:20] right here they said it in ministers
[22:22] meetings they said it and everything
[22:25] else that Paul wasn't no prophet
[22:33] that's a denominational idea right see
[22:36] because the denominations didn't want
[22:38] Paul to be a prophet
[22:40] right you realize why they don't want
[22:43] him to be a prophet then they don't have
[22:45] to agree with what he says and what he
[22:46] talk right man agreed right now that's
[22:50] how simple it is to be a denominational
[22:53] person and that husband if you're you're
[22:56] doing that with is still right there
[22:58] flirting with
[23:00] you in your
[23:04] mind ain't no Bible that says Paul was a
[23:09] prophet
[23:11] well one time he said it you can do what
[23:14] you want to with it he said I magnify my
[23:16] own office so you know if he was an
[23:18] apostle then he magnify his own office
[23:22] but just illustrating all right
[23:26] illustrating are you listening right use
[23:28] an example to show you how simple it is
[23:31] for us to
[23:35] be the prophet Paul here is saying that
[23:37] a woman cannot remarry until her first
[23:40] husband is dead she cannot remarry as
[23:42] long as her first husband is living she
[23:45] by no circumstances at all she must
[23:48] remain single as long as her first
[23:50] husband is living and if she should do
[23:51] such a sin she should be called an
[23:53] adulterous I'm speaking of the natural
[23:56] now to type it with the
[24:00] spiritual he's not speaking of the
[24:02] spiritual to try to show you the natural
[24:05] he's speaking of the natural to show the
[24:07] spiritual
[24:09] right if this woman would commit such a
[24:11] sin then she is marked and adulterous
[24:14] and she has two living husbands at the
[24:16] same time therefore she has forfeited by
[24:18] doing this her rights to God and Heaven
[24:21] by doing so she sure has she is an
[24:24] outcast from the economy of God
[24:27] according to the scpt scriptures that
[24:29] I've just read now that's Romans
[24:32] 7 all right
[24:36] now illustrating
[24:39] it speaking of marriage and divorce
[24:42] speaking of the Natural Woman you know
[24:44] woman speaking
[24:46] of and illustrating by that to show us
[24:50] what God is expecting with the rest of
[24:55] it all right
[24:58] now let's read over again Romans
[25:01] 7 go ahead and pull up number five
[25:07] brother know you not brethren for I
[25:09] speak to them that know the
[25:14] law this is not to just an outcast or
[25:17] anybody that's right that the law hath
[25:21] dominion over a man as long as he liveth
[25:29] now are you reading
[25:31] that do you believe that no Brother D I
[25:35] got born again I ain't under no law law
[25:37] was done away you you you didn't come
[25:39] through the Baptist or
[25:41] nowhere law ain't in existence no more
[25:43] it was done away back God we're under
[25:48] grace New Testament is
[25:51] Grace we'll get to it in a minute grace
[25:53] came away before the law ever started
[25:56] right Abraham's Covenant was
[26:04] Grace but you see our ideas our
[26:07] denominational thoughts what we've been
[26:11] taught Paul ain't no Prophet show me
[26:15] anywhere in the Bible where it says Paul
[26:17] is a
[26:20] prophet that's what people are
[26:26] saying brother ROM call to all theur
[26:28] Church age Messengers
[26:31] prophets you not no trouble call him
[26:34] Luther a
[26:37] prophet but you see how easy it is to
[26:40] have a denominational idea and let not
[26:41] know
[26:43] it you see why it's been 50 years almost
[26:46] since the the going away of the Prophet
[26:48] is still trying to
[26:51] preach I hope we've got out of the dates
[26:53] of the times and the seasons and thing
[26:55] got through marching around hor and at
[26:58] Le at least got to Cades
[26:59] barnea cuz remember they came to Cades
[27:02] barnea and it was only just a few days
[27:05] journey to the promised land
[27:08] right seemed like brother around said 5
[27:11] days or something I was looking at while
[27:12] ago so many days to the to the promised
[27:16] land and you realize they walked you
[27:21] think 40
[27:25] years within five miles
[27:32] y they didn't Venture very far no study
[27:36] your Bible and see even they went 100
[27:41] miles you could still look back and see
[27:43] a lot of
[27:47] it but that's how blind we can be but
[27:51] now look what he
[27:53] says know you not brethren for I speak
[27:55] to them that know the law had the law ha
[27:57] dominion over
[27:58] anyone let's translate that into anyone
[28:02] or
[28:04] mankind as long as he liveth CU if you
[28:06] don't you're going to say the woman's
[28:08] not even under
[28:09] it see how carnal you can
[28:12] be now he goes down to make sure that
[28:15] you don't he interpolates you remember
[28:17] that years ago and I got in trouble
[28:18] trying to explain interpolate it means
[28:20] you simply trying to explain
[28:22] something that's all it
[28:25] means Paul now interpolates the woman in
[28:29] to make sure that nobody could come
[28:31] along and
[28:32] say well the women are not under that
[28:34] that's just the
[28:36] men women would never under law man's
[28:39] always under
[28:42] law
[28:44] Church you think I'm trying to be funny
[28:47] or silly or arrogant or hateful or some
[28:52] something I'm trying to save your soul
[28:55] and mine
[28:59] to show how silly we
[29:05] are verse Two for the woman which hath
[29:08] an husband is bound by the law to her
[29:11] husband watch that's right the man is
[29:15] bound by the law over
[29:18] everything is the woman only bound to
[29:20] the law by her husband no it's simply
[29:22] explaining it this is this is the the
[29:26] man is all of this mankind
[29:29] everybody but illustrating it as a
[29:34] woman all right for the woman which ha
[29:37] an husband is bound by the law of her
[29:39] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[29:40] husband be dead she is she is loose from
[29:43] the law of her husband so then if while
[29:46] her husband liveth she be married to
[29:48] another man she shall be called an
[29:50] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[29:53] she is free from that law so that she is
[29:55] no adulterous though she be married to
[29:58] another
[30:06] man see that old husband's got to be
[30:10] dead not just
[30:12] divorced all
[30:14] right go ahead with the next one while
[30:16] we're on that point
[30:21] because Paul says the wife is bound by
[30:24] the law as long as her husband liveth
[30:26] but if her husband be dead she's at
[30:28] Liberty be to be married to whom she
[30:30] will
[30:31] only in the Lord that's right so you
[30:35] want to leave that off oh she's free to
[30:37] marry
[30:39] anybody only in the
[30:42] Lord the man is only he's free to marry
[30:46] what wife dies he's free to marry but he
[30:49] must marry what in the Lord
[30:54] amen well we certainly didn't do it
[30:56] brother de well all right right so then
[30:59] you got to believe for
[31:03] Grace then you got to cry out for Grace
[31:07] right amen
[31:09] right but think about it
[31:15] now her
[31:18] husband must be
[31:21] dead that's the only way the woman can
[31:23] be loose from that law is for her
[31:25] husband to be dead
[31:28] right you know the word of God bounds
[31:31] her the
[31:33] law we talk about the laws we show that
[31:36] law is just Ten Commandments no the word
[31:37] law is the word of God do you need all
[31:40] of that I looked at today how many times
[31:42] brother brand we talking about the the
[31:44] the god in letter form the Bible is God
[31:47] in letter
[31:50] form but
[31:53] listen not just put him away
[32:00] right as we get to it later you'll
[32:03] understand more what brother Mo used to
[32:04] say about it he said what we do is that
[32:06] we get our coat and hat and we move we
[32:08] change meet and
[32:12] houses but you know what we do when we
[32:14] go to the next meeting
[32:18] house some of you run into trouble
[32:24] here because this old boy don't BK too
[32:27] much
[32:28] and you bring your thoughts from
[32:30] somewhere else and try to bring it in
[32:31] here and I'll bring it out of here and
[32:32] show you it's
[32:35] wrong I have
[32:37] to
[32:40] right you see one of these days you'll
[32:42] realize what a pastor means you know
[32:44] that a pastor means
[32:48] husband I have to look over you as a
[32:50] husband to a wife you know you being a
[32:52] wife
[32:58] well now well come on if you ain't got
[33:00] enough sense to figure that out then you
[33:02] got a problem because I'm not just
[33:04] preaching to a bunch of
[33:06] women I'm preaching to men and women if
[33:08] you need to explain
[33:11] it but think about
[33:13] it see we say we we we left
[33:18] that as I said to those people that day
[33:21] when brother Brown preached so hard
[33:22] against organized religion did they get
[33:25] up and walk out and say is there
[33:27] anywhere that I can go that won't be
[33:30] organized
[33:32] no like my wife said they wanted to
[33:34] watch the gift take
[33:36] place they wanted the signs and the
[33:38] Wonders they didn't want brother randam
[33:41] there and if it hadn't been for a few of
[33:44] them he wouldn't have been into the
[33:47] businessmen some of those men put their
[33:49] their whole stake in that on the line to
[33:53] even to get him an ability to preach and
[33:55] the Christian businessmen
[33:59] cuz they didn't want
[34:02] him how would you want
[34:05] somebody that's constantly telling you
[34:08] you're
[34:12] lost but come on see brother random
[34:16] paragraph 151 152 indivisible Union not
[34:19] just put away he's got to be dead right
[34:27] not just put
[34:31] away there is no
[34:34] divorcement for the woman and listen in
[34:38] the body of Jesus Christ there is
[34:41] neither male nor female you
[34:44] agree so we are all the feminist body of
[34:49] Jesus Christ is
[34:51] feminist it is not masculine he's the
[34:53] masculine we're the
[34:55] feminist so whatever speaks to one
[34:57] speaks to the other all
[35:00] right
[35:03] now to try to get a thought as I said
[35:06] we'll pick up Sunday and more or less go
[35:09] through the new birth marriage and
[35:10] divorce go invisible Union and things
[35:14] the way I'm thinking
[35:17] now but I want you to think
[35:21] about the
[35:26] law so you ask most people say what is
[35:28] the law and they say the Ten
[35:31] Commandments
[35:33] right what would be your answer you know
[35:35] what is the law The Ten
[35:41] Commandments the law
[35:44] is God's word right
[35:47] amen whether it be the Ten Commandments
[35:50] or what is it the 11th commandment I
[35:52] mean the 13th commandment you remember
[35:55] love your neighbors whatever it is there
[35:56] Jesus speaking on the The Forgotten
[36:04] commandment what does it mean to
[36:07] be bound to the
[36:12] law as long as you're
[36:16] alive according to that then there's no
[36:19] hopes whatsoever of anything other than
[36:23] just
[36:25] dying right
[36:28] because you're bound to the law as long
[36:30] as you're
[36:35] alive
[36:40] now man chose
[36:43] law right now what about a group of
[36:48] people what about people who would
[36:50] actually choose law
[37:00] brother random titled the message what
[37:01] is it Church choosing law for
[37:04] Grace they actually chose law thinking
[37:07] it was
[37:08] Grace and it sounds so
[37:12] close until that was one scripture I had
[37:15] a lot of trouble with we'll get to it in
[37:17] a minute in Exodus
[37:22] 19 because of the way that it reads
[37:28] it reads like that God says this and
[37:30] they says we'll do
[37:37] it the brother Brown said that was the
[37:39] biggest mistake Israel ever
[37:44] made all
[37:47] right now I want the point to dwell in
[37:49] your mind what is
[37:55] law you got a law of gravity
[38:01] you got many natural
[38:03] laws brother R said there's plenty of
[38:06] laws in the word of
[38:09] God
[38:11] because the law is the letter of the
[38:15] word
[38:16] amen that's why Paul said the letter
[38:25] kth there is no Grace
[38:28] in the law right now we're going to read
[38:32] in a minute so don't just go BL BL BL
[38:34] off and cut off your computers and like
[38:36] you ought to know me well enough you
[38:38] listen to two tapes you order at least
[38:39] know enough to hang on a
[38:42] minute grace was before the law in the
[38:45] law and after the
[38:47] law all right that's what your Prophet
[38:50] had to
[38:52] say so just think with me what is law
[39:01] the letter of the Bible is
[39:11] law Paul what is the
[39:17] law he said it was a thing that I
[39:20] thought
[39:22] y brought life right
[39:27] we get back to those scriptures is that
[39:29] right is that what Paul
[39:33] said he said I was alive
[39:42] once but he said sin revived and I
[39:50] died no longer I that liveth cuz I died
[39:54] right
[39:56] amen Paul purely truly know that the
[39:59] only way any person could have anything
[40:01] was to die right you remember the Jim
[40:04] Jones situation you know down what was
[40:06] it Guyana where they went down there and
[40:09] there was some old guys are at work you
[40:10] know they're always trying to do
[40:11] something smart because of all of us
[40:13] Brothers being there together one of
[40:15] them asked Fred Hooper one day he said
[40:17] has Sam ever tried to get you to kill
[40:19] yourself he said ever since the Man
[40:21] known me that's what he's been trying to
[40:23] do
[40:32] you see as long as we're
[40:35] alive we got problems that's
[40:39] right my daddy died in 1945 you know it
[40:42] be kind of hard
[40:44] to accuse him of a
[40:47] crime
[40:50] right well because he's dead right all
[40:56] right but now think about it what is the
[41:04] law the law is all of this
[41:11] Bible old and
[41:16] new that is not revealed to you and
[41:23] I that's why man thinks it's a book of
[41:26] rules
[41:28] y That's Why They preach it as a book of
[41:30] rules if we can just get the women to
[41:32] line up but we be ready to
[41:34] go I've heard hours and hours of sermons
[41:37] to
[41:37] those messages like
[41:44] that what is
[41:52] law it's God's
[41:55] word that has been delivered delivered
[41:57] to you and
[41:59] I and we hold it in our
[42:02] hands but it has never been put in our
[42:05] heart
[42:08] right if it's revealed it's no longer
[42:11] law
[42:12] right now here's a good one how many
[42:14] times have you ever heard me explain
[42:16] this or try
[42:18] to you ask people say where did the New
[42:20] Testament start and they'll get in you
[42:23] know then you say well are you still
[42:25] under the law no
[42:28] law
[42:29] ended
[42:33] where where did it
[42:37] end well Christ is the end of the law
[42:40] yeah but read the rest for righteousness
[42:45] say Jesus said I didn't come to destroy
[42:48] the
[42:50] law I came to
[42:52] magnify that's
[42:56] right Paul said Thou shalt not
[43:00] steal Thou shalt not commit
[43:05] adultery Jesus said if you look on a
[43:08] woman to lust in your heart you've
[43:10] committed adultery already see magnified
[43:13] it am you magnify the law and make it
[43:17] honorable right
[43:21] amen I don't know where we get that far
[43:24] tonight but you know that the Ten
[43:26] Commandments was
[43:28] God in letter
[43:30] form to the people
[43:35] amen if I I if I could just know more
[43:38] about God read your
[43:44] Bible
[43:46] right well now now brother d i I just
[43:49] can't understand it so I I'll get me
[43:52] some good news for Modern Men that's all
[43:56] right but that's what you
[44:00] need but I just can't I just can't but I
[44:03] can read some of them new
[44:07] versions well
[44:11] good as long as it takes you to the same
[44:13] God the old versions took you
[44:15] to but when you change God's in the way
[44:18] with another book what have you got
[44:24] amen how come it Paul is saying that the
[44:27] man as long as he
[44:29] leaveth he's bound to the
[44:34] law did he say Jews
[44:41] only that's what you're saying he would
[44:43] say if that's the way you're making
[44:46] it LO and come to Israel you never heard
[44:49] that one Lo they come to Israel we
[44:51] Gentiles we were never under the law
[44:58] and Paul really like to illustrate that
[45:00] by saying you bunch of Gentiles and I'm
[45:03] paraphrasing about 40 scriptures but
[45:05] said you bunch of Gentiles think you're
[45:07] something but said the word didn't even
[45:09] come to you y That's
[45:12] right is that
[45:15] scripture he said the oracles come to
[45:17] Israel said adoption don't pertain to
[45:21] you that it pertains to
[45:25] Israel so then you just
[45:27] take your little Doctrine and little
[45:28] denominational ideas and you just zero
[45:30] yourself out you
[45:33] know I'm trying to get a point across
[45:36] what is the
[45:42] law well in the natural the law of the
[45:45] land is what mankind whether it be the
[45:48] Constitutions Etc is all supposed to be
[45:50] based upon
[45:52] that that man wrote down a bunch of
[45:55] things that said don't do this
[45:58] and it was called the
[45:59] law don't speed don't drink and drive
[46:02] don't do this don't do that you know
[46:05] it's called a
[46:08] law
[46:11] well they can write you a ticket for on
[46:14] a 55 mph
[46:16] Road for 56
[46:19] mph because you just broke the
[46:21] law now watch what we try to see we want
[46:24] to explain we want to explain but
[46:26] brother Dale the County police don't do
[46:28] it that way they got to go 5 miles
[46:31] over they don't have to go one half a
[46:34] mile
[46:37] over they just do that that
[46:41] way you see a state patrol he can write
[46:43] it down if it's one mile over any County
[46:46] policeman can write you up if it's one
[46:48] mile over it might not hang up because
[46:51] the courts is going to say hey that's
[46:52] just not that's just being nitpicking
[46:55] well who's nitpicking is the Georgia
[46:56] State Patrol right
[46:58] one
[47:02] law is a book of
[47:08] rules right the Bible is a book of rules
[47:14] right
[47:16] amen unless you're born again
[47:24] right now what about a book of
[47:28] rules don't do this don't do that don't
[47:30] do this don't do that Paul what about
[47:33] you in that book of rules concerning the
[47:36] law blameless right is that what he said
[47:40] amen in other words he done everything
[47:43] he's supposed to do and didn't do all
[47:45] the things he wasn't supposed to
[47:48] do but brother randam said no
[47:51] man can keep the
[47:54] law that's right
[47:58] Paul could just brag in the bases that
[48:00] he didn't break
[48:03] it but he
[48:06] said I thought that was
[48:11] life right so but I found it to be
[48:18] death what I thought was saving me was
[48:20] killing me
[48:30] law is a set down Stamped Out written
[48:34] out form of some government that has
[48:37] declared it whether it be God through
[48:39] his word or whether it be the policeman
[48:42] you know the the Constitutions the the
[48:44] governors the the the presidents the
[48:47] things it's a written
[48:49] out point to tell
[48:53] you that if you don't break that you
[48:55] don't have to worry about it no
[49:03] right but Paul
[49:07] says if you don't
[49:14] die now he was the guy remember I was
[49:16] quoting a moment ago that said I didn't
[49:18] break the
[49:19] law he said concerning the law blameless
[49:22] come
[49:23] on is that scripture
[49:29] but yet he says a man as long as he's
[49:31] alive he's Bound by the
[49:37] law but if he's dead he's free from that
[49:45] law but you see church that's where we
[49:47] don't understand is what I say and we we
[49:49] we back in organized religion we would
[49:52] tell you in a hurry that we was never
[49:53] under the law we were gentiles
[49:57] yeah carried away the dumb Idols boy
[49:58] what part is that going to put
[50:04] us but you see that's what we've been
[50:08] taught now let me back up on Marriage
[50:10] and divorce just a
[50:13] second why did brother brandham say we
[50:15] were in the marital situations we were
[50:20] in he said because of misinterpreted
[50:24] theology in other words
[50:28] somebody's
[50:31] wording thoughts and
[50:34] ideas that we took to be God's
[50:39] word I believe it was brother Mo told
[50:41] that time he said that he saw serpent
[50:43] seed and somebody tried to talk him out
[50:44] of something like that somebody did and
[50:46] somebody talked him out of
[50:50] it well if you talking out of it what is
[50:54] it but now listen
[50:58] law according to Paul is the
[51:04] word right the entire Bible is the
[51:10] law and the only part of it that is
[51:13] Grace
[51:15] is God to speak to you and
[51:18] I to save us from
[51:24] that you see where you'd be if you was a
[51:26] Gentiles saying that we were never under
[51:28] the law then what would you be saved
[51:33] from you
[51:38] understand
[51:42] Grace was a way before the law came into
[51:49] existence Grace was first amen
[51:53] right Grace was where man sinned in the
[51:57] garden and an atonement was made
[52:02] amen
[52:05] Grace we think we got to run over to
[52:07] Abraham with it now that's where you
[52:08] just coming down to where he stamps it
[52:10] down to one man and said Hey listen you
[52:12] take this and study on it and your
[52:14] generation out of you will have
[52:22] it there was Grace before the law ever
[52:25] came into existence
[52:28] go ahead and pull up number eight
[52:33] brother in Paradox re
[52:37] 65 paragraph
[52:40] 65-66 and also Grace provided an
[52:42] atonement the sacrificial lamb we're
[52:45] getting to that this week on the
[52:47] sacrifice to blood because darlay is
[52:49] your healing so on the atonement had
[52:52] been provided before there was any law
[52:56] Grace was before the law during the law
[52:59] am and after the law
[53:01] amen now when we read it in a minute
[53:04] you're going to have to say wait a
[53:06] minute now let me swallow l r said
[53:08] there's no Grace in the
[53:13] law he said it's a policeman to put you
[53:15] in
[53:18] jail but notice the way he's saying
[53:22] it Grace was before the law during the
[53:26] time would the law be in existence there
[53:28] was
[53:32] Grace what saved David
[53:34] from being
[53:37] killed Nathan the prophet which was
[53:40] Grace am that's right
[53:42] right he said but I've prayed for you
[53:45] David you're not going to die
[53:46] amen Grace was before the law during the
[53:49] law and after the law so there was
[53:54] Joshua read this very carefully
[53:58] Joshua representing
[54:00] Grace that was during the
[54:02] law you remember Moses the one that
[54:05] brought it and then
[54:07] Joshua representing Grace was right
[54:10] along with
[54:13] law but could not be enforced as long as
[54:17] law was in its proper
[54:23] place so there was Grace during the time
[54:26] of the
[54:28] law the atonement could be made during
[54:30] the time of the law The Ten Commandments
[54:32] that we want to talk
[54:39] about Grace is the oldest teacher there
[54:41] is in the
[54:43] world it teaches us to not our
[54:49] ungodliness Grace was the lamb that
[54:52] stood slain before the foundation of the
[54:54] world Amen
[54:57] it was Grace that kept Eve from being
[55:00] killed not Adam injecting a
[55:03] seed right you see how easy you take a
[55:06] denominational thought and what are you
[55:08] doing with it you just
[55:12] died but brother so and so
[55:18] says so
[55:24] what but you you you just you're just
[55:26] against
[55:29] everybody
[55:32] well who was it Martin Luther was it
[55:35] that they
[55:37] said don't you know
[55:39] that yeah the whole world's against you
[55:43] he said I want them to know I'm all I'm
[55:45] against them too
[55:48] Amen brother told Wade the other day he
[55:51] said one thing brother Dale don't like
[55:53] is false
[55:54] Doctrine that's one thing I don't like
[55:57] right is false Doctrine CU false
[56:00] Doctrine will kill you yes sir and the
[56:03] worst thing is false doctr is not
[56:04] exposed right amen that's
[56:10] it now let me say something it'll be
[56:12] about 20 messages down the road but
[56:14] maybe it'll help
[56:16] you uh Brother Dean they taught you in
[56:19] karate to if you do not allow your mind
[56:22] to uh look at a
[56:24] block and pass through that block with
[56:27] your mind you with the ability of a soft
[56:29] hand you can bust
[56:31] it but if your mind ever blocks that
[56:35] thought you're going to have a busted
[56:40] hand
[56:44] right you say well what are you talking
[56:48] about I'm talking about that they told
[56:50] everybody you know that nobody could
[56:52] ever run a 4 minute wouldn't it 4 minute
[56:55] mile
[56:57] it was just
[56:59] impossible well here comes a guy along
[57:02] that according to records would have
[57:03] never supposed to walk or
[57:06] anything and you know they just forgot
[57:08] to tell
[57:11] him and he just went out and broke
[57:15] it you know there's a law that says a
[57:18] bumblebee cannot
[57:21] fly his wings spread is not big enough
[57:26] but they just ain't been able to explain
[57:28] that to the
[57:32] Bumblebee he said what are you talking
[57:35] about I'm talking about if the word of
[57:37] God can keep being revealed to you and I
[57:39] somebody's going to walk right straight
[57:41] through death and look at it and life at
[57:43] it that's right that's what I'm pointing
[57:46] at but we got to get rid of all these
[57:48] laws that's bound us yes
[57:53] sir we got to get rid of our ideas and
[57:56] thoughts that binds
[57:59] us and get free
[58:06] amen we asked Josh to pull the sound
[58:09] system and peek it a little bit to make
[58:11] make me a little bit finer cuz we' got
[58:13] down to a course like form and the way
[58:16] I'm hollering tonight I don't think it
[58:17] going to be no course to this one I
[58:20] think we get it pretty
[58:22] good but now listen
[58:30] Grace was there in
[58:35] Joshua but
[58:38] couldn't couldn't be made manifest
[58:40] because why what's the prophet saying
[58:46] amen because the law of
[58:51] Moses was binding everybody
[58:57] yeah
[58:59] right and the law of
[59:02] Moses binding the
[59:07] people do you understand why
[59:10] then that when 12 went
[59:14] over right 12 crossed over 10 come
[59:22] back the law had them bound
[59:26] we cannot take the
[59:28] land two came
[59:31] back picking up the thought of
[59:34] Grace amen
[59:37] right but which one
[59:40] won
[59:46] right Joshua and Caleb was never capable
[59:49] of explaining what they
[59:52] saw and the reason they believe they
[59:54] could take the land
[59:57] because the people was bound by their
[59:59] law of their
[1:00:02] mind holding on to
[1:00:05] Moses we got what Moses
[1:00:09] says you remember the marriage and
[1:00:13] divorce Moses gave us a writing of
[1:00:16] divorcement to put our wives away for
[1:00:18] any
[1:00:21] cause Jesus said now Moses didn't tell
[1:00:24] you that that's right
[1:00:27] well do you think they quit believing
[1:00:30] Moses and started believing
[1:00:34] Jesus if you do there's something wrong
[1:00:36] with you mentally let anything
[1:00:38] else they never stopped it
[1:00:42] no see that's why I don't believe in
[1:00:45] converting bodies and and spirits of
[1:00:48] people
[1:00:52] right why you get them in with a hot dog
[1:00:54] you get them out with a get them in with
[1:00:55] a a hot dog you get him out with a
[1:01:00] hamburger that's right but if you can
[1:01:03] touch that
[1:01:05] Soul
[1:01:07] amen and talk to that Soul a
[1:01:13] while the lord gave me years ago ability
[1:01:16] one
[1:01:17] time and that's all he ever let me do
[1:01:20] it that I backed up in my own self and
[1:01:23] stood and looked at people from what he
[1:01:30] saw and it was literally as a tunnel
[1:01:33] just standing looking and just went back
[1:01:35] into
[1:01:36] it and I saw what he
[1:01:41] saw but you know what happened when I
[1:01:43] come back to my natural I saw what I saw
[1:01:45] y right
[1:01:50] amen but
[1:01:52] listen Grace was D the prophet says
[1:01:56] with
[1:01:58] Joshua but could
[1:02:02] not now are you going to follow me amen
[1:02:07] could not come into its proper place
[1:02:13] why because the people were still
[1:02:16] looking at
[1:02:21] Moses right right the problem with it
[1:02:25] they couldn't get Moses off the scene
[1:02:28] amen exactly
[1:02:34] right that's
[1:02:35] right
[1:02:38] okay but you know what there's a lot of
[1:02:40] places in this message that preaches
[1:02:43] that we got to get the prophet off the
[1:02:46] scene you ain't never heard me preach
[1:02:51] that so you think I was bringing a point
[1:02:54] then to drive down that thought no oh H
[1:02:56] you missed it see I just trapped
[1:03:06] you but Moses was still on the scene in
[1:03:09] those people's
[1:03:13] mind and they couldn't follow
[1:03:17] Joshua Moses was still on the scene in
[1:03:20] them Pharisees
[1:03:23] minds and they couldn't follow Jesus
[1:03:25] right
[1:03:28] amen there's your
[1:03:32] law the cornal Mind
[1:03:36] Right
[1:03:39] amen law deals in the carnality of our
[1:03:42] human mind don't do this don't do that
[1:03:45] well I never done that so I'm okay
[1:03:56] I know I ain't going to get very far
[1:04:03] so trying to figure out which way to
[1:04:08] go you realize that the children of
[1:04:10] Israel chose
[1:04:12] law for Grace or thinking it was Grace
[1:04:21] right all right so I'll hold those
[1:04:24] quotes there in Joe if you will orever
[1:04:26] who's on it jump over let's get a
[1:04:28] thought and I'll just quit because I
[1:04:30] know I can't I can't continue all the
[1:04:33] way through so I'll pick these up Sunday
[1:04:35] how that and prove how that the children
[1:04:37] of
[1:04:38] Israel accepted law instead of Grace all
[1:04:42] right let's go to Exodus 19 and I want
[1:04:44] to read the scriptures and just
[1:04:47] see we'll come back to it Sunday and you
[1:04:50] just hold on to it run around and said
[1:04:51] that was the biggest mistake Israel ever
[1:04:53] made
[1:04:57] was in Exodus
[1:04:59] 19 I want to see where their mistake
[1:05:05] was Exodus
[1:05:08] 19 Moses went up un God you remember the
[1:05:11] mountain and the
[1:05:12] things this is coming back out this is
[1:05:15] not the the time over there where they
[1:05:16] were end and coming down you know and
[1:05:19] and do this is when they come on out and
[1:05:20] they're standing next to the mountain
[1:05:23] Moses went up un God and the Lord called
[1:05:25] to him out of the mountain saying thus
[1:05:27] shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and
[1:05:29] tell the children of Israel and watch
[1:05:33] tell them what tell them
[1:05:36] this tell the children of Israel this
[1:05:40] that I have to say about
[1:05:42] them ye have seen what I did unto the
[1:05:45] Egyptians and bear ye on you on eagles
[1:05:49] wings and brought you unto myself
[1:05:56] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[1:05:59] indeed and keep my Covenant then you
[1:06:03] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[1:06:05] above all people for all the Earth is
[1:06:08] mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom
[1:06:11] of
[1:06:13] priest in a holy
[1:06:15] nation these are the words which Thou
[1:06:18] shalt speak unto the children of
[1:06:20] Israel this was before
[1:06:24] law all right Moses came and called for
[1:06:28] all the Elders of the people and laid
[1:06:30] before their faces all these words not
[1:06:33] the Ten Commandments that's the next
[1:06:35] chapter chapter 20 is The Ten
[1:06:40] Commandments laid before their faces
[1:06:42] these words words of what
[1:06:44] praise
[1:06:46] Grace around said God provided a prophet
[1:06:50] a pillar of fire a healing atonement
[1:06:53] that was Grace to Israel right and they
[1:06:56] wanted a law they wanted something to
[1:06:59] do but now I want you to read it in
[1:07:02] there and see if you can find them
[1:07:03] saying they want something to
[1:07:06] do I used to bother me when I read
[1:07:10] that to be able to sit down and just
[1:07:13] read the scripture
[1:07:14] plain and not be able to
[1:07:19] see God says you're this you're that
[1:07:22] you're that all you got to do is just
[1:07:23] keep my word you know just like line up
[1:07:25] and be fine Moses came and called the
[1:07:28] Elders of the people and laid before
[1:07:29] their faces all these words which the
[1:07:31] Lord commanded him and all the people
[1:07:33] answered together and said all that the
[1:07:36] Lord has spoken we will
[1:07:42] do and Moses returned the words of the
[1:07:46] people unto the
[1:07:48] Lord now where is it there of a bad
[1:07:51] thing of accepting law it looks like
[1:07:55] because law has not been spoken
[1:07:59] yet it look like they were just saying
[1:08:02] heyen we believe we're A peculiar people
[1:08:04] we believe we're a priest we believe
[1:08:05] we're a holy
[1:08:07] nation all you say
[1:08:14] Lord that we'll
[1:08:20] do do you understand what I'm
[1:08:23] saying come on I mean do I need to keep
[1:08:25] going over and over the point you to
[1:08:26] think about
[1:08:28] it the prophet said this is the biggest
[1:08:31] mistake they ever
[1:08:32] made when they chose law instead of
[1:08:36] Grace Grace had already provided
[1:08:38] everything and Grace told them what they
[1:08:45] were it looked like God gave them the
[1:08:49] law it looked like God was the one that
[1:08:51] was doing
[1:08:54] it come on read your Bible look at
[1:08:59] it but we got to believe what the
[1:09:01] prophet had to
[1:09:02] say and then we see the final
[1:09:08] results the final results I won't have
[1:09:10] time to get to it but the final results
[1:09:13] is when you get over in Exodus 20 after
[1:09:15] the law is
[1:09:18] delivered and God came down on the
[1:09:21] mountain and they said don't let Moses
[1:09:24] don't let God Speak to us anymore God
[1:09:27] Moses you go get it bring it
[1:09:30] down showing they had made a
[1:09:33] mistake but the prophet of God said that
[1:09:35] was the biggest mistake we'll pick that
[1:09:36] part up in the thought cuz if I go very
[1:09:39] far I got to go into these look at
[1:09:40] number 16 let's see what brother Bram
[1:09:43] had to say
[1:09:44] about I've jumped to about eight quotes
[1:09:47] So we pick them up Sunday go ahead to
[1:09:48] number
[1:09:49] 16 which is taken of Abraham's Grace
[1:09:53] Covenant he
[1:09:55] 17 and Abraham never received this
[1:09:58] promise while he was in
[1:10:02] circumcision didn't receive it under the
[1:10:07] law now we know Abraham was way before
[1:10:10] the law so what's brother talking
[1:10:13] about they took circumcision and brought
[1:10:15] it under the law and they thought it was
[1:10:16] a thing that cleansed them I've always
[1:10:19] believed
[1:10:21] that that those Israelites believed in
[1:10:24] serpent seed
[1:10:26] the perversion of the wound and they
[1:10:29] thought circumcision cleansed
[1:10:33] it come
[1:10:36] on while he was in circumcision under
[1:10:38] the
[1:10:39] law but when he was under
[1:10:42] grace before circumcision was ever
[1:10:47] issued therefore it's not nothing that
[1:10:50] we could do to Merit it's God's grace
[1:10:52] that gives it to us by faith Abraham
[1:10:55] believ God and it was imputed to him for
[1:10:57] righteousness the law is what man wanted
[1:11:01] not what God
[1:11:07] wanted the law was never the perfect
[1:11:09] will of
[1:11:13] God now I just said some things that a
[1:11:16] lot of people wouldn't dare to
[1:11:19] say because they're afraid to run into
[1:11:22] all words like that the law was never
[1:11:24] the will of God
[1:11:29] I'm trying to show you that they chose
[1:11:31] it that's why they said give us
[1:11:33] something to
[1:11:37] do it was never the will of God look at
[1:11:39] the next
[1:11:42] one look at number
[1:11:45] 17 does God ever change his mind about
[1:11:47] his word preaching 65418
[1:11:50] even paragraph 96 God permitted Israel
[1:11:55] to take a law in the 19th chap Exodus
[1:11:58] 19th Chapter when Grace had already give
[1:12:01] them a prophet Pillar of Fire sacrificed
[1:12:04] lamb a delivering power but they cried
[1:12:07] out for a
[1:12:10] law now watch it wasn't God's
[1:12:17] will but it was injected because man
[1:12:21] wanted
[1:12:23] it and he was cursed by the very law
[1:12:27] that he
[1:12:35] wanted but you see we got to prove that
[1:12:37] point we've got to get enough thought
[1:12:38] some way to prove that Israel was
[1:12:40] actually
[1:12:43] wanting I said that take too
[1:12:47] long they chose
[1:12:50] law it was not God's will
[1:12:59] you said well I thought I thought it was
[1:13:01] God's will to give him the law I thought
[1:13:04] see you talk to a denominational person
[1:13:05] tell them it wasn't the will of God you
[1:13:08] going to get laughed out of the country
[1:13:10] but they'll tell you that that was God
[1:13:13] perfect God giving them the law you know
[1:13:16] there's a Doctrine back there I ran into
[1:13:17] it before I run into this message you
[1:13:19] know there was a Doctrine back there
[1:13:21] that says in I forgot what church it was
[1:13:23] in but said that that the soul never
[1:13:26] come into existence until the law was
[1:13:33] given man was only body and spirit until
[1:13:36] the law came when the law came gave him
[1:13:37] a soul CU a soul is a I mean gave gave
[1:13:40] him a the law gave him a soul because
[1:13:42] the law is a knowledge of right and
[1:13:50] wrong he well I never heard that I just
[1:13:52] wonder how many times we sat and listen
[1:13:54] to a lot of things
[1:13:56] come on folks wake up when you're
[1:13:58] listening I mean are you going to church
[1:14:00] just to sit there I've been to
[1:14:05] church your soul is dependent upon what
[1:14:07] you're
[1:14:08] hearing you better be concerned about
[1:14:11] what you're hearing and you better be
[1:14:13] checking out what you
[1:14:17] hear that brother just so good he's just
[1:14:19] so wonderful I feel so good when he's
[1:14:21] preaching but brother Dale he just
[1:14:25] Wy Wy
[1:14:28] W
[1:14:33] yeah it's like I asked a lady one time I
[1:14:35] said what does your pastor preach on the
[1:14:37] soul she said I went there about four or
[1:14:39] five years I don't know he never did
[1:14:40] tell
[1:14:41] me I well four five years at least you
[1:14:44] already got around to it by then
[1:14:48] somewhere but you see
[1:14:51] church we can make it look so beautiful
[1:14:55] the soul never came into existence till
[1:14:57] the law came because the law brought a
[1:14:59] knowledge of sin I'm quoting
[1:15:04] scripture the law brought a knowledge of
[1:15:08] sin made you come into a
[1:15:11] soul I told a person after this little
[1:15:14] meeting was over that day I said well
[1:15:17] according to the Bible Adam was made a
[1:15:20] living soul and I said no no more you
[1:15:24] know leave it
[1:15:26] alone but it didn't change
[1:15:34] him you see
[1:15:36] Church nobody's going to get changed
[1:15:38] with anything new birth or marriage and
[1:15:40] divorce or invisible Union unless it's
[1:15:42] revealed that's
[1:15:44] right you remember when we went over and
[1:15:46] over and over on the marriage and
[1:15:48] divorce that brother brand said it's got
[1:15:50] to be
[1:15:51] revealed if it's not revealed it's not
[1:15:53] far you
[1:15:58] but Brother D we never under the
[1:16:04] law when Mama told
[1:16:07] you don't go in the dark room or outside
[1:16:11] when it's dark cuz there booger Bears
[1:16:13] out
[1:16:16] there that put a law in Motion in you
[1:16:19] and made you scared of the
[1:16:23] dark right
[1:16:29] you got old enough to realize ain't no
[1:16:30] booger
[1:16:32] bear but you never got over Mama telling
[1:16:36] you to not go out in the
[1:16:41] dark a
[1:16:48] law see what it is to be law
[1:16:52] folks we'll find out Paul said to thing
[1:16:55] the law that he thought was
[1:16:58] life he said it was
[1:17:02] death killing
[1:17:08] him as I was say while ago about the
[1:17:11] karate that where that you get to the
[1:17:13] place that you don't allow that to
[1:17:15] control
[1:17:16] you when somebody gets to the Bas in
[1:17:19] this word that this the laws and the
[1:17:21] things that we've been taught and all
[1:17:23] the baby ideas and the sugar te and the
[1:17:25] things that's been taught to us by
[1:17:27] mankind somebody's going to get to a
[1:17:29] place that all that can be
[1:17:32] dead and they can walk
[1:17:38] out that's what I told them when I left
[1:17:41] the Baptist
[1:17:43] Church I went to church in this message
[1:17:45] and I told him I said God got me out of
[1:17:47] the Baptist now I want to bapst out of
[1:17:50] me amen
[1:17:56] but Brother D that's a good
[1:18:03] brother I remember a man one time
[1:18:08] that said all us on God's side step over
[1:18:12] here and there was 250 priests was cold
[1:18:15] off the altar stood back off her way
[1:18:18] from Moses and the Earth just swallowed
[1:18:21] him up
[1:18:24] read your
[1:18:26] Bible the next
[1:18:29] day they came to
[1:18:31] Moses and they said you've killed the
[1:18:34] people of
[1:18:36] God he ought to walk back and said make
[1:18:39] another
[1:18:43] hole but by then Grace had taken over a
[1:18:46] little bit in
[1:18:47] Moses see there was Grace during the
[1:18:50] time of the law we'll get to it Sunday
[1:18:52] they ain't one dble Grace in the law
[1:18:55] no read it that's
[1:18:58] right the letter of dos and don'ts
[1:19:00] cannot bring you to
[1:19:06] Salvation
[1:19:08] cannot so when Israel
[1:19:10] said whatever you say Lord will
[1:19:14] do what do you think they ought to said
[1:19:20] it it just don't sound like that they
[1:19:22] were choosing it sound like God said
[1:19:25] here it it I'm going to give it to
[1:19:28] you and that's what he was doing he was
[1:19:32] giving it to him because that's what
[1:19:33] they
[1:19:36] wanted but remember this
[1:19:39] quote the prophet of God said God will
[1:19:42] take a permissive
[1:19:44] will and make it work for his perfect
[1:19:49] will that's right
[1:19:53] amen you that brother around and said
[1:19:55] taking people by the hand and doing the
[1:19:57] things like that was a permissive will
[1:19:59] of
[1:20:01] God he said I'll show you one day that
[1:20:03] that was not right to do
[1:20:05] that God took that and brought the
[1:20:08] people to a perfect
[1:20:11] word what about it let's
[1:20:15] stand law or Grace
[1:20:19] amen which are we ruled by
[1:20:27] but Brother D I'm just afraid that I
[1:20:28] might get caught with a bunch of Rules
[1:20:30] and Things no don't worry about it you
[1:20:31] already caught by right that's your
[1:20:33] natural
[1:20:36] nature and I'm going to make a
[1:20:40] statement the new
[1:20:43] birth don't cleanse a lot of them
[1:20:45] denominational
[1:20:47] ideas
[1:20:49] right you want to
[1:20:51] quote brother brandham said we're free
[1:20:54] from
[1:20:55] sin and bound by our
[1:21:02] Creeds no the new birth it's everything
[1:21:05] went I just I can show you where the
[1:21:06] Prophet said
[1:21:11] amen but show me the rest he
[1:21:17] said he said you women don't you think
[1:21:19] because you got long hair and long
[1:21:20] dresses that means you're saved
[1:21:22] right that's The Book of
[1:21:25] Rules the rule says don't do do don't do
[1:21:29] do don't cut your heart don't do this
[1:21:30] don't that's
[1:21:36] rules Grace is a person amen one of
[1:21:41] these days you'll realize what I mean by
[1:21:43] that Grace is a
[1:21:45] person it's the person in Jesus
[1:21:49] Christ God made manifest to you by Revel
[1:22:00] Grace what do we need what we got number
[1:22:03] two in the red
[1:22:05] book number two in the red book anybody
[1:22:07] have a name I Journey Through the land
[1:22:10] singing as I go pointing to calary from
[1:22:16] the Crimson
[1:22:18] FL just keep breing invisible
[1:22:25] I just read it read it
[1:22:27] again I read it three times read it
[1:22:35] again you want to know what the new
[1:22:37] birth is bring the future
[1:22:39] home the streets of
[1:22:43] Glory
[1:22:46] my last then we'll get down to it to see
[1:22:49] what the real meaning of all of it is
[1:22:52] like the prophet said
[1:22:54] the night when them Ten Commandments
[1:22:57] came he said the seals came
[1:23:02] downan
[1:23:07] soul I just can't see how you put the
[1:23:10] seal the 10 commandments
[1:23:13] together it ain't been revealed to you
[1:23:15] the reason You
[1:23:18] Came
[1:23:20] Forever Joshua was there on the streets
[1:23:24] of
[1:23:25] Glory but they were Bound by Moses Book
[1:23:28] of

[1:23:33] him God Al the
[1:23:38] high and
[1:23:40] behold the children of Israel they were
[1:23:42] Bound by that
[1:23:44] law We Believe
