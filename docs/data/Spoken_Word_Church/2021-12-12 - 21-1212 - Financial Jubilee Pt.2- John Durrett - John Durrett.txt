TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god bless you all once again praise the lord we thank god for this this opportunity again to have this um sunday school lesson and um see some of y'all came back for for part two so we we thank the lord thank the lord for that and um definitely hearing from some of you all that it's been a blessing so i thank god for that i know it's inspired some like brother taran said he's going to start charging for prayer requests now so um i can see he's been inspired that's exactly right so i could say i can't help the response that it produces in you or your other half or your better half or your worst half but uh by god's grace i'm trusting to be a blessing so this is financial jubilee part two and um as i said before you know that jubilee is just that trumpet it's a trumpet that's sounding saying you can go free and as our prophet said when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free so it just becomes a choice and there's certain reasons why that it's difficult to go free just as if i was coming and we were in slavery and we had to get free it's going to require something something that we got to do on our part so we'll get right into it and i want to just play this quote i heard it yesterday and it just really touched my heart brothers you could move to the next slide and i'm just going to play it just so you can hear it go ahead brother you can move to the next one go down to slide 15. and go to the next yeah i'm gonna play this right here [Music] if our hearts condemn us we want complete deliverance we don't want to be halfway church we want to be a real church or no church at all we want to be real christians aren't no christians at all we want total deliverance from our habits of our sins from our people thanking from our evil doing from our negligence whatever we've done we want total deliverance [Music] so that when people come into this church to be prayed for there will be just this little group maybe not over a hundred or two sitting here but they have been completely in the hands of god [Music] when we pray then god will hear from heaven god wants somebody that he can hold in his hands somebody that he can say i got confidence in amen praise the lord so that's there we want to be real christians you know or no christians at all we want total deliverance from our habits from our evil our sins our evil thinkings our evil doing our negligence and so when i think of that you know it's it's really about being real christians in all areas of our life you know my dad always told me a story of a sister uh that backslid she was in the message and she blacks backslid and she had a nominal christian friend and uh the nominal christian friend was trying to argue that her being a nominal christian was a real christian and this backslidden message believer said let's look in the mirror we both have on pants we both got on makeup and i'm telling you i'm not a christian so if we look exactly the same that should give you some idea so it's the same thing within our financial lives you know if we look at our financial life it's exactly the same as someone else in the world we got debt we got problems can't figure it out then it's something going on and that's not saying you're not a christian but we shouldn't look like the world it shouldn't be the exact same you know we talked about the government last time and how bad that is and but if we're no different then we're we're caught up we're tied and that's what financial jubilee is all about it's like we can be free by the grace of almighty god through the next slide we know as i brought up this quote last time a prophet said clean up your lives pay your debts oh no man get all things off your hands get everything right make ready get ready remember in the name of the lord something is fixing to happen so we we certainly have no excuse we look in the word it's saying hey oh nobody we have our prophet that's saying that now we need god's grace to be able to walk in this you know it's certainly not um you know a sunday school lesson certainly i know it can be inspiring especially when talking about money or it can move you in some way but it's really about doing it's about actually going in and doing something different we go to the next we talked about some symptoms and we'll briefly just run through some of these again this is just if you went to the doctor and they was trying to give you an idea of something wrong these are some things if you're facing some of the things in your life then it's a good indication that there'll be some bit some type of financial bondage so if you're always worried about money it's just it's not enough you confused things are not ironed out you know that's an issue bail out you know you're always looking for the next one trying to find the next thing that's going to help clean up your situation immediately you know you're going to get that next deal or if you sell this many products and you get 10 other people to sell these products you're going to be out of all your problems cover up you know this is when you're broke but you're still looking like everything's okay greed you think you deserve it it should be me resentment because you see others getting things and you're like man you know how do they do that indulgence trying to find things to make you happy as i mentioned i had a good one good one with that when i started losing all kind of money i was just getting ready to go buy me a vehicle on loan i was going to make my own self happy no plan you don't know what happened you know you don't know what happened at the end of the month others might know but you'd seem not to know also you're the middle man everything that comes in goes out help wanted you want to help but you just don't got it to help i always said this is like the broke good samaritan and then we got the debt trap this is when you just don't have it you can't pay your bills you got debt collectors calling you something is going on all right we're going to go talk about principles the only way out of this is god's principles and standards so we're going to go a little bit deeper on some of these principles principle number one god owns it all i talked about is the 10 we pay our tithes but it's also the 90 he just gave you that piece to manage so we don't waste our money we're actually wasting his money if you go on brother to the next he owns it so the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein the silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the lord of hosts he's telling us he owns it all so you can rest he's giving you what he knows you can handle and what you can handle he's not giving to you he owns it all in haggai just looking at that scripture and going back over it they were building that temple and the prophet haggai was telling them zerobowl he was like be strong he was telling all the people he says god said i'm with you saith the lord and work and work he said he want them to work for i am with you saith the lord of hosts so he said i own all the silver i got it all but you got to work and that's the same thing he's telling us he have he has unlimited resources but he wants us to put in the work because it's something in the work that you get when you do that work but he owns it all the next he controls it look at these scriptures both riches and honor come of thee and thou reigneth over all and in thy hand is power and might and in thy hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all first samuel 2 7 it says the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and lifteth up he controls it he owns it he controls it the next he provides it but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus philippians 4 19 deuteronomy says but thou shalt remember the lord thy god for it is he that giveth the power to get wealth he owns it he controls it he provides it that should give you some peace that you can't and i like to tell this to my son you can't out earn god i hope you understand what that means you can't manipulate enough or i'm going to work on sundays i'm going to do whatever it takes to get ahead he's telling you he owns it he controls it he provides it and that's what the world has set us up to think that there is a shortcut there is some method that you're gonna get ahead but there is none because he owns it he controls it he provides it now he's giving trump the money for a reason he's doing that he's given the allah mosque who owns the car the tesla my son knows all about that god has given that to him for a reason and he knows that man is going to follow exactly what god allows to happen with that money but us as christians god knows how much we can handle how much we can't he's telling us through his word so that's principle number one he owns it all go to the next our prophet says anything that you have need of on this life's journey god will supply it if you have need of it he promised to supply your needs not your wants your needs and he's god and he can give he can only get it to you as you believe him so as we believe him he's already made the promise that he's going to supply all that we need all that we need and not all that we want but all that we need he knows so if you don't have it yet it's a reason but he's promised to give you all that you need and i have seen this in my life's journey i have seen this god provide i remember getting laid off on my job and i would just go back to philippians and read that scripture over and over god is going to supply all my need and certainly the lord would open up another job opportunity by his grace so he provides go to the next so if he controls he owns he provides then what's our part we are the managers that 90 that we have we are the managers of that and we need to manage his resources diligently get organized the scripture says he becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh rich ma he owns it controls it and provides it but we need to manage it now diligent what does that mean that means careful persistent work attention it's like you're legally expected to act so you think about a contract that's what the word diligent if you look that up that's what it's dealing with like you are legally expected to act as a party of a contract that's what he's looking at slack that we know what that means that means careless sloppy and yes sometimes a little bit deceitful can be it's like if i loaned you my car and you just left the doors open the rain coming through it's you know you let animals walk in insects it's like you don't care you left it somewhere it's like i don't know where it is i'll deal with it later my and you came back and said can i borrow it a second time we would have some conversations put it that way well it's the same thing this thing that money that we have for our entire life from the youngest you can probably remember to the oldest you have to deal with this thing money but look how we treat it we don't think it's god's we just kind of slack i'm doing this i'll figure it out one day you know all these things i've met couples and their families and myself going through it you know coming out of college i thought i had again figured all out and i was just everything that came in was going out everything that's how i like okay i got the money i can do it that's what i thought you know if i can make this payment then i can borrow 16 years old i was getting my first loan i think it was as jc penney's for a vcr i went in there and i was like they said well you can sign up and you get yourself a vcr like can i okay i signed it walked out with a vcr i think it was 275 for a vcr but it had a remote control and i was like yes my goodness then i had a girlfriend on top of that who is now my wife so that credit card that christmas man i was like she's gonna be blessed so i blessed her with some christmas gifts and i got myself some debt so we would start out on the right track as you can see [Laughter] so it says the hands of the diligent as the scripture says shall bear rule but the slothful shall be under tribute scripture says it's required for a steward that a man be found faithful so that's faithful with the hundred percent that god has blessed you with faithful regardless of how much it is if it's a little if it's a lot you're faithful with that also faithful in the little things money is a little thing but the faithfulness of it is the big part that's what god is looking at faithful because it's someone else's it's god that he's given to you he's loaning that to for you to manage so you're being faithful with what he's given to you and the greatest thing about faithfulness that i've seen faithfulness it unlocks something and that it unlocks contentment which we'll talk a little bit about that so again you are the manager god owns it he controls it he provides it but you need to manage what god has given to you let's go to the next a prophet said and therefore i know as a steward of his money i'm going to have to answer for it at the day of judgment and that's not just to the prophet that's a christian we're stewards of his money of his money notice how he says that it's of his money wow that's nothing but the truth help us let's go to the next principle three and four this is dealing with spending so you spend his money so money is time you're purchasing stuff with your time you're working an hour you know your pay if you waste that money you've just wasted that time that god has given you so don't trade any of your time on earth for useless stuff act as we tell our children act your age well throughout your life journey at your wage act how much you have simply don't spend more than you earn wait save and stay creative and pray now you notice i'm bringing out that word stay creative because acting your wage it does something when you hold you wait you pray oh you've given god an opportunity that's what he's looking for you've given him an opportunity you're not taking the world's way and this is where it gets hard because we live in a world where it's like you don't need to wait on anything you don't need to wait why are you waiting when i can sign you up and you can get this interest loan and you're good on your way that's what it's all about buy now pay later anyway and they're coming up with every method in the book to make sure you can get it right now don't wait don't wait don't wait on that other tool don't wait on this get it now you need it now and we think we're gonna get ahead if we take this route when he already says he owns it he provides it he controls it so what that comes down to we have to stop spending money that we don't have it's that simple you have to stop god has given you to manage what you can manage in this season you know i remember just starting out in our marriage and man we were buying all this new furniture and stuff like that before we had kids and all that quickly when they came along you realize why i needed to wait because everything that we had started getting messed up real quick it was a perfect time for some second-hand furniture if we would have known so you see how god is just lining it up we didn't need a new vehicle with all the food crumbs and everything being stuck into everything no we didn't need that but we didn't know it at the time because the world was saying get it now you need this new brand new minivan that's what you need but my thank god for his lessons we start learning god has given you what you can manage in the season he's trying to tell you what you can handle it's less stress is less decisions if you stick with what god has given you when he's ready for you to have more you will have more because he knows you can manage it he will know it's the right season for you at that time by his grace a lot of the farmers you know what caused a lot of their problems they start coming out with all this new equipment get this new equipment that's going to help you take it to the next level that's going to do this and before you know it these farmers were upside down with these fancy huge equipment trying to take it to the next level and never ever really got ahead but that's how the enemy does now there's nothing wrong with that new equipment out of that tool or whatever it is that you desire but you gotta wait until god provides it to you he's trying to get it to you but he's trying to show you how he's able to provide again the world is very complicated he's got credit you got debit cards things are out of control your husband your wife all each one that's why i said i'm not responsible for their reaction to what they're learning this this morning but each one we all have different personalities the way we handle money some are spenders some are savers you got these different personalities but i'll tell you no matter what if you're out of control with it then you have to do something differently you have to change how you're doing it one thing we started doing when god started opening up and we started realizing oh my god i can't keep up with all this stuff we went down to cash on certain things like hey we give it to the bank yeah it was slow we had to slow down we couldn't just run to the store we went to the bank we started getting cash all right okay this is how much we're gonna have for groceries we put that in an envelope yes we could use credit and debit cards and all that but no let's use the cash and my wife would have to go into that store and look in that envelope and oh my god that's the last thing you want to do is start telling them we're going to take that off especially when you got somebody behind you like but hey when you're looking at freedom you have to do what you have to do but guess what it start helping us back up start slowing things down do i really need this and man we start getting our focus oh my after we lost all that money and we start executing in this way it changed our life man i tell my wife today we have never been closer than when we were going through this journey after we lost all that money and we got focused we didn't go for a bailout we could have went for a bailout i could say hey it's in the equity loan forget it it'll be another 20 years before it paid off no big deal but god said no get it done there is a way because i start questioning why i'm paying my debts i'm paying my tithes i am doing everything i know to do i wasn't a big spender but i'm doing everything i know to do so lord how did this happen to me and god was simply saying i have a way i have freedom for you if you want it and i have seen that i have proved it out by his grace the scripture says the wise man saves for the future but the foolish man spends whatever he got that's where i was everything came in man we started making a little bit more money i told you about the 40-year loan it was like yes 40 years that's fine our payment is going to be a little bit lower so we can get some more stuff in that house for 40 40 years my god 40 years but that's i thought that was the way i thought that's what you do setting myself up for this world that's what all my education all my knowledge all that got me more loans leverage this leverage that don't use your own money do this do that that's all the world's lies to trap you god has such a wonderful way for his children praise god amen let's go to the next our prophet says someday i'm going to have to answer for every penny of money that's been given to me every penny oh god is a master accountant believe me he knows every dime he's passed your way and he's going to hold us accountable to what we've done with that now he wants to bless his children there's no doubt because he owns it all but he wants us to be a steward of that and he wants to prove us not just these natural blessings and i hope you can see between the lines it's spiritual it applies to everything he's trying to get to us it's character that's what he's trying to get to us but he gives us this little thing he allowed this economy to be set up on money for a reason it didn't have to be we could be on the border system or something like that you got to trade something you know you got some cows you could trade that but he allowed it to be money for us because it can apply to anybody the kids want money the older one the younger everybody wants money what my parents don't leave to me when they leave what they're not gonna leave to me when i leave etc etc so it's something we deal with god allowed that but every penny that goes out he knows and he's giving it to us for a reason and we're gonna have to answer for it there is a reason why it's so difficult especially in our time and it's one word that's leaving our society it's leaving this world it's going out and that word is no that's a very hard word i guarantee you if you ask me for something i said no you're gonna have a little problem you're gonna pause for a minute like what no don't tell your kids that they're gonna do the same thing like no that that no that's it's not no it's what do i need to do you know if you want to go buy a car and i said well no then we're just not going you don't know what you mean no i can get a co-sign i can get somebody i can get this let me tell you how i can do it but that simple word no and our prophet said the world is full of it advertisements and television and radio and newspapers and the american people fall for such as that that's the american people we shouldn't be there we should be christians christians by his grace and be able to wait on our lord that's why he says so much wait on the lord wait on the lord go to the next we can say no to debt say no to that the world tells you what we deserve we should have it but as a christians we don't deserve debt oh my we used to go to when we were young and we didn't have that much you know coming in we would go on these um what do they call it it's time share and you could go on a free trip and get a time share presentation oh my lord in like we got a free trip we got a meal i'm pretty sure we can keep them away but they get in they start telling you deserve it you look at your wife like don't you want to give her the best vacation in the world oh don't you want to do that and we thought we were smart we were like no we don't want it and they take us to the next level and the next level we got to a third level of a presentation and the man was like you're so smart john you all that other stuff is just for those that are quick but you are a thinker you're wise and let me show you what we got for these special people we got this kind of deal and guess what you can try it out and do all this and by the time we walked out i had myself a signed up contract my god my lord but praise the lord for his grace we had a three-day turn around so i didn't have to be in his face so i called him i said no we don't want it at least i'm on the phone but i've realized how quick you could be convinced your wife's sitting there and she's like yeah do i do you think i deserve it well see you get yourself trapped but the bible says oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another has fulfilled the law the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant slave to the lender oh the blessings of the lord is make it rich and he added no sorrow with it oh my borrowing is slavery my friends believe me you loaned someone some money you see them walk in with a new outfit and they haven't paid you back you feel differently you're like yeah i like that outfit mm-hmm what about that money i gave you that's what you're thinking in your heart like yeah that's real nice but it'd be real nice if you didn't owe me some money i've been there been been many times and if you haven't been there maybe you the one that they looking at your outfit so stop taking on more debt you're really robbing yourself again when i had that 40-year loan once i started sitting down and taking time and not listening to the world i realized that i would be paying out twice as much for that house if i took 40 years to pay that off you borrow a car you get a car let's say you get a six-year car no 20 000 you're going to be paying back about 31 000 so forget the nonsense and say how much i'm really going to be paying on this car do you want to pay 31 000 for that car do you forget what they're telling 20 000 just interest rate well how much am i gonna really be paying because that's what you're about to put in 31 000 for a 20 000 car that's how much you're going to pay and no room for god to act on that because god specializes in these things if we follow his way 31 000 so you can see how the prophet said clean up your lives pay your debts how do you handle this i'm a little practical write down the smallest to the largest debt that you owe if you're responsible for the money in your home write it down it doesn't be anything fancy take a napkin a plate anything a piece of paper write it down what's the debts that i owe what do i owe anyone if you got family members you borrowed from anybody write those things down and then make it a family event like honey let me just show you a little bit of something so just in case you didn't know this is what we owe everybody and use that to help you slow down and then focus on that smallest one and say what can we do to hit this thing can we sell something do we really need this hey let's sell it let's put the money towards that that's what you do that's what we started doing christmas gifts anything we got it was like we gonna sell whatever we got sell it new furniture we had sell it sell it we got to pay back this debt that we're in and that's what we started doing so write it down don't run from creditors if you owe somebody money you don't have to run away from your mom your aunt and whoever you borrowed money from say you know what i know it's been a lot going on i know i owe you some money i'm gonna start i'm gonna start paying this off real quick we're running out of time next we'll run through some principles really quick saving and investing of course this is coming up click the next it says go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise which have no guide overseer or ruler provided her meat in the summer and gathereth her gathereth her food in the harvest you can just see those pictures that's that's really the cycle of life you start off young and before you know it before you know it you're you're you're older my dad i said was an extremely hard worker at brother ray's funeral he was just talking my he said i wish i had the strength that i used to have as a young man i never heard my dad talk like that but something moved him in that and certainly he's not the same young man that he was i'm not the same person i was when i was 20 in 30. and i'm in my 40s i'm just not the same i want to do the same but it's not the same and i'm still working i'm in the season of life where i'm working this is a season of my work years it's not in the season of us just having kids i got all teenagers in that range this is the season of me working as a father like solid you look up dad you'll see me that's me it's like there it is you're working you're trying to manage kids you're trying to manage family you're trying to manage the natural the spiritual all those things you're trying to do that's the season of life i am but i know this is not the remaining season of my life it's going to change next i'm going to be empty nesters next we're going to keep going up that's what it's going to be and we can see the whole range within this church you can see it so we have to do certain things when we're younger like setting aside a little something so when i'm older that's what we have to do so wherever you are make sure you have an emergency fund if you're young a teenager make sure you have like as you work and start sending a little money 500 for an emergency fund have that set aside if you're a little bit older have a thousand if you're a little bit older have several months of your full expenses set aside you should know and can take a little time to write down all of the expenses i usually have to pay in a month you may have about three thousand four thousand whatever it is maybe for you but you should know something you can go to to say yep it just take me probably about three thousand dollars a month and then start setting that aside have three to six months of that set aside just in case something happens then you're prepared next we won't read this whole thing but it says if jesus is coming in the morning preached today like like it was going to be 10 years from today but live like it's going to be this hour don't get all scrupled up he says that's what i'm trying to warn you of just don't be odd for cue you don't change nothing but if you're doing something wrong or doing evil repent basically he's saying hey go keep planting your potatoes keep planting your prepaid even if you know god is coming this can trip us up many times like oh i'm going to spend everything because god's going to come well make sure you're not in debt because you're going to leave that to somebody but don't spend everything you have because emergencies they do come up and we need to be prepared for whatever seasons are coming let's go to the next giving is the best investment keep going brother what's enough of course as you keep managing god you're gonna get something god is gonna put a lot in your hands to manage and then you're gonna move to the questions of lord what's enough enough is enough more than enough i don't need all of this i don't need all of that okay i can start giving out some of this stuff because we know the scripture says is more blessed to give than to receive keep going the last be content keep going are you contend that's the question and how do you get contentment how do you get it keep going well to get contentment you must learn it that's the bottom line that's why i said i love presenting this but it's something i can't give you i can't give you contentment contentment is learned and you must learn it paul says not that i speak in respect of one for i've learned in whatever state i am therewith to be content keep going and the last talking about a faithful steward this is what god is trying to get to us keep clicking brother a faithful steward owes blessings a faithful man should abound with blessings but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent he wants to give us those real blessings great gain godliness with contentment is great gain some of those great gains are character self-control hard work self-denial patience diligent frugality gratefulness all those things that we need in our spiritual life as well but something that you can apply naturally and just take it on to your spiritual my and it will produce it that's what it does and certainly more responsibilities i have seen that god will give you more but he's not just going to give it to you he's going to give it to you to where when you see more it just becomes oh lord you're giving me more responsibilities that's what you're doing lord i see it it's not something that's frivolous or just you giving me this new car just have a new car a new house just that lord you're giving me more responsibilities thank you lord but i know it's a part i have to play i have to manage what you've given me so stop spending out of control stop adding more debt write down your debts do save for an emergency fund promise you god is not in the subtracting business he just wants to add to our lives and bless us that we can be a faithful steward and have something that we can relate to all these spiritual things that we're being taught in his word through our prophet at this church we've been taught these natural and spiritual things so we can have that character that god will be pleased with so god bless you appreciate all of you and i pray god bless you as you start continue doing on this journey god bless you [Applause] you
