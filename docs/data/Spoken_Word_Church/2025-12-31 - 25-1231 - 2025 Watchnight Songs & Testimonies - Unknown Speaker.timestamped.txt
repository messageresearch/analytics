[11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister June, would you like to
[11:58] come and sing?
[12:01] And the uh surprise guest,
[12:04] the surprises, if they'll come up here.
[12:09] You know who you are.
[12:11] Come on now.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; No pressure.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; No pressure.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; There he is.
[12:29] How are you?
[12:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[12:47] Please hear.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm just not myself. Although I look
[13:14] the same. The portrait that I used to be
[13:18] is in a different frame. I feel the
[13:22] sudden [music] strength, but I'm as
[13:24] helpless as a child. And you may see me
[13:29] grinning like it's going out [singing]
[13:31] of style. The things I used to treasure
[13:36] just get in the way. The people I once
[13:40] hated, I love them on
[13:43] [singing and music] each day. The crown
[13:45] I'm used to wearing has been turned
[13:49] upside down. Since Jesus [music] came
[13:52] into [singing] my heart and turn my life
[13:55] around, he lives in me.
[14:02] He lives in me.
[14:08] [music]
[14:08] &gt;&gt; He bought me with [singing] a price. Now
[14:10] I'm no longer on my own. My life is his
[14:16] kingdom. [music and singing] My heart is
[14:18] his throne. He lives in me.
[14:25] He lives in me.
[14:31] The [music and singing] king of all
[14:33] heaven and earth is living in me.
[14:39] [music]
[14:43] Now, even when I'm tempted, good and
[14:46] evil are [singing] at war. The battle's
[14:50] getting longer than [music] it's ever
[14:52] [singing] been before.
[14:55] And I know where my [music] strength
[14:57] lies. I [singing] can't do it on my own.
[15:01] Then I get reinforcements cuz I'm never
[15:05] left [music] alone. He lives in me.
[15:12] He lives in me. [singing]
[15:18] &gt;&gt; He bought [music] me with a price. Now
[15:20] [singing] I no longer am my own. My
[15:24] [music] life is his kingom. My heart is
[15:28] his throne. He lives in me.
[15:32] [music and singing]
[15:35] He lives in me.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; [music]
[15:42] &gt;&gt; The King of all heaven [singing] and
[15:45] earth is living in me.
[15:50] [music]
[15:53] He lives in me.
[15:56] [music]
[15:59] He lives in me.
[16:05] He mocked [music] me with a price that I
[16:08] no longer am my [singing] own. My life
[16:12] is his kingom. My [singing] heart is his
[16:16] throne. He lives in me.
[16:22] He [singing] lives in [music] me.
[16:29] The king of all heaven
[16:31] [singing and music]
[16:31] and earth is living in me.
[16:38] [music]
[16:43] [applause]
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say he lives in you?
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. For those that don't know it,
[16:53] that's my oldest son right there.
[16:56] You can't tell by looking at him.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; Everybody Everybody tells me all the
[17:02] time that's you could deny him if you
[17:03] wanted to.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I don't know. He's pretty
[17:08] good. I
[17:11] over there,
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Sarah.
[17:14] But uh appreciate that song. That was
[17:16] wonderful. Amen. So, as we're going down
[17:18] the road, we're going to ask Sister Dawn
[17:21] or Sister Elizabeth, whichever one you
[17:23] like to come sing.
[17:29] Amen.

[24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:06] And uh I know Brother Wade mentioned it
[24:08] before and I just want to mention it
[24:09] again. Just because you don't sing don't
[24:11] mean you can't testify.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; We It's only It's only 10:15. We still
[24:16] got some time. I know we got some more
[24:18] songs, but uh we're gonna turn over to
[24:20] Sister Trudy. Let her come. She wants to
[24:22] testify and then she wants to sing also.

[24:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless you, saints.
[24:43] Um, as we
[24:46] get ready to end 2025,
[24:50] um, I just want to first
[24:55] thank God for
[24:58] trials, tribulations,
[25:02] &gt;&gt; and also thanking him for bringing me
[25:05] through those trials and tribulations.
[25:07] Amen.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Um, we always talk about, you know,
[25:12] signs and wonders, follow the believer,
[25:14] but we mostly talk about the signs, but
[25:16] we don't talk about the wonders much.
[25:19] And I just I don't talk about my past a
[25:23] lot. And I just want to
[25:26] share certain things to I guess is for
[25:29] me
[25:32] back when I was living in Trinidad. Um,
[25:36] I wasn't a Christian then. And I
[25:39] remember I was probably about 18 or 19
[25:41] years old and I was laying in the bed
[25:44] and I was like, you know, not going down
[25:48] the right path. Um, my mom was doing the
[25:52] best that she could. My dad was living
[25:53] in the US and I saying to myself, Lord,
[25:57] if you get me out of this situation,
[26:00] I remember saying, I'll serve you for
[26:01] the rest of my life.
[26:04] But you know, you have these thoughts,
[26:06] these
[26:08] pin moments, and you go back doing
[26:10] whatever you you're used to doing.
[26:13] And I could remember one time I was in a
[26:16] party, a big open concert,
[26:19] friends hanging out, drinking, you know,
[26:21] everybody's happy. And I remember
[26:23] closing my eyes and saying, "Lord,
[26:24] people say this is the greatest show on
[26:26] earth, but I ain't feeling it."
[26:31] &gt;&gt; But still, I wasn't a Christian yet.
[26:35] And it came a time I was probably 19. My
[26:39] dad came to visit. At the time he was
[26:41] living in New Orleans and he said, "You
[26:42] know what? I'm going to file for you for
[26:44] you to come to America."
[26:46] So I was like, "Yes, this is my
[26:48] opportunity to leave this place. Start
[26:49] over fresh because you know I'm not
[26:51] going down the right path right now."
[26:54] And
[26:58] I came,
[27:00] there came a time, Kurt and I were
[27:01] friends back then and
[27:05] he actually asked me to marry him and
[27:07] move in and do all that stuff and I was
[27:09] like
[27:10] that ain't happening cuz I'm trying but
[27:13] I didn't sorry let me let me rephrase
[27:16] that. [laughter]
[27:18] That's what I said in my mind. I never
[27:20] explained to him why I said no.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[27:26] &gt;&gt; And I said it in my mind because in my
[27:28] mind I just wanted to get out of
[27:29] Trinidad
[27:31] &gt;&gt; because I knew I wasn't go I wasn't
[27:34] going down the right way. And people
[27:36] will try to talk to me about God. I will
[27:38] just run like I ain't trying to hear you
[27:39] right now. I'm gone.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; And I was just running.
[27:45] And it so happened that my papers came
[27:48] through. I was getting ready to leave.
[27:49] and Curran. We had separated after I
[27:52] didn't answer and
[27:55] he came in the message first
[27:58] and I was like, "Oh, he a church boy
[28:00] now." I was like, "Okay."
[28:03] [snorts] So, I just like, "You know
[28:05] what? I'm going to jump on this plane.
[28:07] I'm going to start over brand new.
[28:09] Nobody going to know me. Nobody going to
[28:10] know my past. Nothing."
[28:13] So, I came to the US. I went to New
[28:15] Orleans for that where my dad lived. And
[28:18] my dad is a very difficult person. And
[28:20] the reason why I didn't want to go down
[28:23] that way with Kern at that time because
[28:26] I think to myself, my mama going to kill
[28:27] me and my daddy is not going to file
[28:30] them papers because he's a very
[28:33] different person to deal with. So if he
[28:35] say he's going to do something, you
[28:36] better stand in line to get that done.
[28:38] Otherwise, he gonna change his mind and
[28:40] flip of a dime. So I behaved myself. I
[28:44] came to America and
[28:48] Kern came to visit sometime for his for
[28:51] the August September time frame and
[28:56] unknowing to him
[28:59] before that sorry you know I was going
[29:01] through a lot and he presented the
[29:03] message to me and I said to him
[29:08] I hear you I believe what you're saying
[29:10] but I don't think I'm ready for that
[29:13] yet. And that was just honest me talking
[29:17] because I was going through something,
[29:20] but I guess God was calling me at that
[29:22] time and I didn't know what it was. So,
[29:23] I'm looking back now. I was like, you
[29:24] know what? He was with me all the time.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; And
[29:31] three years after that, Kar came back
[29:33] again with the message. [laughter]
[29:35] And this time when he came to visit, he
[29:37] had, you know, back in the day you had
[29:38] the CDs and he had to find a number to
[29:40] go with the message on the computer. So
[29:43] he had the whole
[29:45] flip book binder thing with all the CDs
[29:48] with the message. And I was like, okay,
[29:50] cool. I was like, we'll listen to one,
[29:53] see where it goes. And from there,
[29:57] my mind start changing. I start asking
[29:59] questions.
[30:01] Things start happening. They start
[30:03] clicking. And I remember we was on the
[30:05] phone talking
[30:07] and he said to me, he's like, "If I
[30:10] prove to you in the Bible that a woman
[30:11] not supposed to wear a pants,
[30:15] what you going to do?" I was like,
[30:16] "Well, if you can prove that, I will
[30:19] I'll listen to you. I'll believe you."
[30:21] And I was like, "Nohere in the Bible
[30:22] said that." Me thinking I know
[30:24] everything, right? [laughter]
[30:27] So, he told me the scripture and I'm
[30:29] flipping through and I read it. I was
[30:32] like, "Oh,
[30:35] say, okay,
[30:37] something happened." Now, at the time, I
[30:40] didn't understand what it was or what I
[30:42] was going through. And then one day, I
[30:44] heard Brother Sam said, "You know, when
[30:46] you're going through something and you
[30:48] get that prick in your heart and I was
[30:49] like, wait, that happened to me."
[30:52] And I was like, "Okay."
[30:55] So, we keep talking. We keep asking
[30:58] questions. And
[31:01] I mean, I had like $800 phone bill
[31:03] talking to this guy in Trinidad about
[31:05] the word. And I was like, "Look, I going
[31:08] to pay this bill, but I need to hear
[31:09] more." You know, and every time I go to
[31:10] work and I thought of something, I'll
[31:12] call him like, "So, what about this?
[31:14] What about that?" And he's just there
[31:16] gracefully answering all my questions.
[31:18] And he said, "Listen,
[31:21] I am not a pastor, so you going to have
[31:25] to find you a church to go to."
[31:28] So I was like, "Okay, fair enough." So,
[31:30] you know, both of us on both ends
[31:32] looking for churches and it came across
[31:36] two churches in Georgia that was listed
[31:38] on this site I was on. Can't find the
[31:40] website no more. And there was a church
[31:43] in Lincoln and it was this church.
[31:47] So, I sent it to him. I was like, "Well,
[31:49] I got these two churches. I don't know
[31:51] what to do. I got to make a decision."
[31:53] and he's like, "Well, we'll pray about
[31:55] it and God will guide you to where you
[31:58] need to go." And I came across the
[32:02] website here and
[32:05] I was like, "Okay, the profile looks
[32:08] good." It's like, "Okay, cool. I'll
[32:09] check it out and see." And I remember
[32:14] I was still in justification stage. And
[32:17] in justification stage,
[32:20] all kind of thing happens. You in, you
[32:22] out, you outside, you're not, you're
[32:23] sitting down, you're standing up. It's
[32:25] confusing. And I remember I went to my
[32:29] friend's house and we were playing regga
[32:30] music and hanging out and stuff and
[32:32] something said to me, I didn't bring you
[32:34] this far for this.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; And I was like, and then I remember
[32:41] that day when I was laying on the bed
[32:42] and saying, if you take me out of this
[32:45] situation, I'll serve you for the rest
[32:46] of my life.
[32:48] And
[32:50] [snorts]
[32:52] I just step away from everybody.
[32:55] I called the church and I guess that's
[32:58] when we used to have two services. I
[32:59] think Sister Jun answered the phone and
[33:01] I asked I was like, "Do you guys do
[33:03] water baptism?"
[33:05] And she's like, "Yeah." I was like,
[33:06] "Could you do it today?" She's like,
[33:08] "Hold on, let me find out." So I guess
[33:10] she went and asked for a deal. And I
[33:14] just jumped in the car and I started
[33:15] driving. And I was like, this place is
[33:18] far cuz I was coming from Stone Mountain
[33:22] and I was like where is this place? I'm
[33:24] on 985. I was like did I miss the turn?
[33:26] I was like I'm saying nope I'm not going
[33:28] to turn around because I promise I was
[33:31] going to do something because he did
[33:32] something for me.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; And I'm driving down the road and I
[33:37] finally I got to this place like an hour
[33:38] and a half later
[33:40] and I don't know what time service
[33:42] start. I just know I want to get
[33:44] baptized. I came out from the streets.
[33:47] Straight up the streets out of nowhere.
[33:49] And
[33:51] I I guess I got here like about 3:30.
[33:53] Service ended at 4. So I had no regards
[33:57] for time.
[33:59] And sure enough, Brother Dale said, "Are
[34:01] you the lady that called about being
[34:03] baptized?" I was like, "Oh my gosh."
[34:05] It's like, "Yeah."
[34:07] He's like, "All right, we're gonna have
[34:08] a baptism today."
[34:11] And that said day
[34:16] I
[34:17] gave up everything. Not and it wasn't
[34:20] me. It was Christ in me that I didn't
[34:22] know was there.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; And
[34:27] I can tell when I went through my
[34:29] sanctification phase
[34:32] &gt;&gt; after I got baptized again. I felt weird
[34:37] people talking to me and I was like, I
[34:38] don't know you. I don't know what to
[34:40] say. I don't know how to answer, you
[34:42] know. And you know, you're coming from
[34:44] being on the streets into the message
[34:46] and everybody's so nice and I was like,
[34:48] "Oh my gosh, this is like different up
[34:49] here in the country." [laughter]
[34:53] So, so we got baptized. I went through
[34:56] my phases and there was this one day
[35:00] I was
[35:02] again I was a single parent at the time
[35:04] and I was just going through cleaning
[35:08] praying
[35:10] and something just struck me. It's like
[35:12] the whole room is open up and like
[35:15] something got poured inside of me and
[35:17] then the room just closed back and I was
[35:18] like
[35:20] wow. From that day on, I had a joy that
[35:25] nothing
[35:26] can can can stop that joy.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Now, don't get me wrong, we have good
[35:31] times, we have bad times, we have
[35:33] trials. I just went through a medical
[35:36] situation the other day, but that joy
[35:39] was still there. Even though it's not
[35:41] showing or it's not abundant, it was
[35:44] still there.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; And I thank God. And I'm looking back
[35:47] and I was like, you know what? I'm
[35:48] looking back at 2025 and I was like,
[35:50] "No, my journey didn't started then. My
[35:52] journey started way, way back as an
[35:55] unrepented sinner,
[35:58] &gt;&gt; not knowing that he was calling me all
[36:01] that time
[36:02] &gt;&gt; cuz I wasn't looking for him.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking." So, I just wanted to
[36:08] share that with you because I don't
[36:10] really talk about my past a lot. I
[36:12] always talk about my America past, but
[36:14] not my Trinidad past. And um he's
[36:18] brought me through a lot.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; And um the song I'm gonna sing is Jesus
[36:23] I love you because he cared because he
[36:24] cared for unrepentant sinners
[36:29] prayer
[36:32] and he kept me through this time.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; So I hope the song is a blessing to your
[36:37] soul tonight.
[36:53] Not because I've been so faithful,
[36:58] not because I've [singing] been [music]
[37:00] so good.
[37:03] You always been there for me to provide
[37:07] my every need.
[37:11] You were there when I [music] was
[37:13] lonely.
[37:15] You were there in all my [singing] pain,
[37:18] [music]
[37:21] guiding my footsteps
[37:23] and shelter from the [singing] rain.
[37:29] And it was you
[37:34] that made my life complete. [music]
[37:38] You are to [singing] be my everything
[37:42] and that is why I sing.
[37:48] Jesus, I love you.
[37:52] Because you care.
[37:55] [singing]
[37:56] [music] I couldn't imagine
[38:00] if you weren't there.
[38:03] [singing]
[38:05] Jesus, I love you.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; [music]
[38:09] &gt;&gt; because you care.
[38:13] I couldn't imagine
[38:16] [singing]
[38:17] if you weren't there.
[38:21] You are my joy and my [singing]
[38:24] salvation. [music]
[38:26] You're the peace in my storm.
[38:30] Your love and arms protect me.
[38:34] You shelter me [singing]
[38:36] from harm.
[38:38] You are al for omega,
[38:43] the beginning and the end.
[38:47] My strong tower, [music and singing]
[38:51] my dearest and best friend.
[38:57] And [music] it was you
[39:01] that made my [singing] life complete.
[39:05] You are to me my everything.
[39:10] [music] And that is why I [singing]
[39:12] sing.
[39:15] Jesus, I love you.
[39:19] Because you care.
[39:23] I couldn't imagine [music]
[39:27] if you weren't there.
[39:30] [singing]
[39:32] Jesus, I love you
[39:36] because you care.
[39:40] I couldn't imagine
[39:44] if you wasn't there. [singing]
[39:48] Jesus, I love you. I love you. [music]
[39:52] Jesus, I [singing] love you. I love you.

[40:17] Because you care. [singing]
[40:21] Jesus, I love you.
[40:27] [applause]
[40:52] Amen.
[41:01] We got a little song here for the
[41:04] I was going to say the Roberts family
[41:06] and the Collins family.
[41:18] You know it's going to be special.
[41:19] Brother Kern's here.

[41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord,

[41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here we go.
[41:40] [music]
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Well, Daniel tells about a king long ago
[41:46] that built for all of Babylon [singing]
[41:48] an image of gold. Set a fiery hot
[41:51] furnace is waiting for you. If you don't
[41:54] bow and worship when I tell you to
[41:57] [music]
[41:59] read on a little further about three
[42:01] brave men who wouldn't
[42:03] [music and singing] bow to the idol know
[42:05] they wouldn't give in. So the king got
[42:08] mad and said boys you're through. Let's
[42:11] see if your God will deliver [singing]
[42:14] you. [music]
[42:17] Then they threw three [singing] men
[42:21] down into the fire. [music]
[42:25] They were bound [singing] and cast in a
[42:28] flame that was seven times taller.
[42:31] [music]
[42:34] They saw Shazorn
[42:37] [singing]

[42:43] [singing]
[42:46] walking around [music]
[42:51] [music]
[42:54] and fire
[42:56] one.
[42:58] He said, "I set you free to worship as
[43:01] you wish. There's no other God that can
[43:04] deliver like this
[43:07] [singing and music]
[43:10] down into the fire."
[43:14] &gt;&gt; They were [music and singing] bound and
[43:16] cast in a flame that was seven times
[43:19] high.
[43:23] They got [music] shacked. [singing]
[43:27] suicide window [music and singing] and
[43:29] the fire is a dream in the for [music]
[43:34] walking around.
[43:39] Now if the enemies tied your feet and
[43:42] your hands, [music] remember the story.
[43:48] Remember the story [music] and the
[43:50] lessons we've learned. The ropes that
[43:52] tied them were the only [music] things.
[43:57] Yes, they threw three [singing]
[43:59] men
[44:01] down [music] into the fire.
[44:05] They were [singing] bound and cast
[44:07] [music] in a flame that was seven times
[44:10] higher.
[44:14] I saw Shack [music and singing]
[44:16] Shack.
[44:18] But who was that with a man of fire
[44:21] below
[44:23] [music]
[44:25] [singing]
[44:26] walking around
[44:30] and that's the kind of [music] God
[44:33] [singing]
[44:34] that I serve.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's [music and singing] the kind
[44:40] of God that I serve
[44:45] [music]
[44:48] right [singing]
[44:52] [music]
[44:52] with them in the fire below. Three men,
[44:56] but there were four [singing] men
[44:58] walking around. [music]
[45:03] There were three men, [singing] but
[45:05] there were four men walking around.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; [music]
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:17] Amen.
[45:20] They threw three men in,
[45:23] &gt;&gt; but there was four men walking around
[45:27] and there wasn't no harm done to them.

[51:13] God bless you.
[51:30] Um
[51:32] 365 days ago we were here at the same
[51:35] time
[51:37] and uh we worshiped we had a good
[51:40] service
[51:42] and then we asked the Lord
[51:45] to protect us as we went into 2025.
[51:49] Right. Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; And now 365 days after so so much has
[51:53] happened. Um humanly speaking you can
[51:56] only see the physical but spiritually
[51:59] you know where you are 365 days ago
[52:03] and you can testify where you are
[52:06] &gt;&gt; now.
[52:08] What I can say it's a miracle.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; It's a miracle. And that's what
[52:17] I better stop. That's that's what we're
[52:20] going to sing about. We're going to sing
[52:22] about the Lord being a miracle working
[52:25] God.
[52:26] This is one of uh Sister Mila's
[52:28] favorite.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We we have a little twist [music]
[52:32] and I implore you to join in. It is it's
[52:35] a participatory song. If you want to
[52:37] dance, if you want to jump, I want to up
[52:40] the ante a bit because the Lord gave you
[52:42] breath. Give it back to him.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, here we go.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; [music]
[52:53] &gt;&gt; He's a miracle working God.
[52:58] He's a miracle [singing] working God.

[53:24] and omega.
[53:26] He's a miracle working [singing]
[53:29] God.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; He's a chain breaking God.
[53:36] [music]
[53:36] &gt;&gt; He's a chain breaking God.

[1:38:04] church that had diversity in it. You
[1:38:06] know, people that come from different
[1:38:08] backgrounds and
[1:38:10] tell you what, we uh we ended up with it
[1:38:13] here.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; And I thank the Lord, we've got we've
[1:38:16] got such a wonderful diverse group here.

[1:38:22] I think of that song, they come from the
[1:38:23] east and west. They come from the lands
[1:38:26] afar to feast with the king to die at
[1:38:29] his guest. How blessed those pilgrims
[1:38:31] are.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; You know, we found them all from all
[1:38:34] around the world have come.
[1:38:36] This one little spot here in Georgia.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; We've been blessed.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; And not only the ones that the Lord has
[1:38:44] sent in here and then over the years,
[1:38:46] we've been able to travel and minister
[1:38:48] and

[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; blessed so many from around the world.

[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; In this little part
[1:39:36] and just
[1:39:38] it's a humbling experience, but you

[1:39:41] sisters that come from all the different
[1:39:44] countries, and
[1:39:46] it's so it's so wonderful to to realize
[1:39:48] what God's done for us.

[1:46:42] well, I have two songs um that I would
[1:46:45] like to sing.
[1:46:47] The first one, uh
[1:46:50] my sister inspired me. I was just going
[1:46:52] to sing one, get everybody blood pumping
[1:46:54] like I did last time. But um
[1:46:57] [laughter]
[1:46:59] but um
[1:47:01] [sighs]
[1:47:03] I graduated college this May 9th, 2025.
[1:47:10] Spent six years in college. Um
[1:47:16] hated it every second of it. Um I
[1:47:19] despised it.
[1:47:22] But it was my wilderness. Um,
[1:47:25] that's one thing that I've learned in
[1:47:29] the past seven months since leaving
[1:47:32] school is
[1:47:35] you never know what every what the day
[1:47:37] will bring you.
[1:47:39] And we often talk about how
[1:47:44] we often talk about how
[1:47:46] it's important to
[1:47:48] have faith and how we have to believe.
[1:47:51] But nobody speaks about the days when
[1:47:54] your faith is kind of there. Not when
[1:47:56] it's completely when it's kind of there.
[1:47:58] Like you're there, you have the faith,
[1:48:00] you believe, but it there's something in
[1:48:02] your heart that's just like, well, I've
[1:48:04] been believing for two years. I've been
[1:48:05] believing for six months. I've been
[1:48:07] believing for 10 years. and you just you
[1:48:10] want to keep walking, but that next step
[1:48:12] is just
[1:48:15] not going.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; You're trying to lift your foot and go,
[1:48:18] but it's not going. And this song I'm
[1:48:22] singing is uh by a brother um from back
[1:48:25] home, brotherly folk. Um [snorts]
[1:48:28] the name of the song is one uh
[1:48:30] translated is one day on the path. Um I
[1:48:33] was walking and I met the Lord.
[1:48:37] Um,
[1:48:39] and he walked with me. Like the verse
[1:48:41] that said, I was walking along the beach
[1:48:45] looking for the Lord.
[1:48:47] Look to my left to look to my right. I
[1:48:49] didn't see him. But when I looked behind
[1:48:51] me, there were two sets of steps.
[1:48:53] [snorts] So, he was walking with me the
[1:48:55] whole time. He was just inside.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:49:25] [music]
[1:49:32] [music]

[1:59:42] Boyd come sing and then when brother
[1:59:45] Boyd gets done, we're gonna uh turn it
[1:59:48] over to brother Wade and get ready for
[1:59:50] communion.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's been good tonight.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh can I give just a two-minute
[2:00:00] testimony real quick?
[2:00:02] And forgive me, I got to back up to when
[2:00:05] I had heart surgery
[2:00:07] last year. the 20 2024
[2:00:11] to till today.
[2:00:13] I'll tell you what happened today.
[2:00:15] Praise the Lord. But uh I was sitting in
[2:00:19] uh 2024. I pulled up a red light on a
[2:00:22] note in Thompson Bridge and I was
[2:00:24] sitting there and my vision literally
[2:00:26] changed. I went blind for a moment. My
[2:00:29] vision changed to a different level in
[2:00:31] my glasses for a period of time. Then it
[2:00:33] finally came back. go to the doctor and
[2:00:35] they told me I had type two diabetes.
[2:00:38] So I get insulin, I get oimpic and I get
[2:00:44] weighed 230 pounds. I got exmpic and
[2:00:48] some kind of insulin. I forget what it
[2:00:50] was that I took a shot seven days a week
[2:00:53] on Wednesday. I took two shots of Zimpic
[2:00:55] and the other insulin.
[2:00:58] So that books on down into when I had
[2:01:01] the heart surgery into
[2:01:04] uh November 2024
[2:01:08] and I go in there and just go in for uh
[2:01:11] I was up here lead music and had a loss
[2:01:13] of air. I couldn't talk about this for a
[2:01:16] year. I just can now can share it with
[2:01:18] you and I apologize for that. But I want
[2:01:20] to thank Tony and everybody come to see
[2:01:23] me and brother Wade. And when I went to
[2:01:25] sleep and woke up, Tony was there. When
[2:01:27] if he wasn't there, when I went to
[2:01:29] sleep, woke up, Brother Wade was there.
[2:01:31] But I just appreciate that. But I'm
[2:01:34] trying to get up to today for one reason
[2:01:36] to show you how God is mindful of you.
[2:01:40] So I booked through uh all while I was
[2:01:42] in there, seven people died while I was
[2:01:45] in there on that floor coming out of
[2:01:47] recovery. And that made me determined I
[2:01:50] was pushing my way out of there.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; And I come out pushing hard and it was
[2:01:54] tough.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; But I get through that and get booking
[2:01:58] on and taking uh all the insulin still.
[2:02:03] Uh shot every day, two on Wednesday.
[2:02:07] Uh five different medicines. And then I
[2:02:10] decided to take some of my own little
[2:02:13] medicines to help things. So, I was
[2:02:15] taking 13 pills a day up until
[2:02:19] uh two months ago.
[2:02:22] And um so I go back uh in 2025, we start
[2:02:28] moving into things and I get going along
[2:02:30] and certain incident happened with me
[2:02:33] that uh broke me spiritually. I mean, it
[2:02:36] broke me, wiped me out and I was ready
[2:02:39] to give up on everything. And all of a
[2:02:42] sudden, I decided, you know what? I'm
[2:02:44] gonna forgive everything that happened
[2:02:45] to me and I'm gonna decide that I'm
[2:02:48] gonna pray the Lord that he restore unto
[2:02:49] me the joy of my salvation.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; So I had a brother come to me and he
[2:02:53] said, "Why don't you just leave here and
[2:02:55] go to church where your son goes?" My
[2:02:57] son used to go to church here.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; And uh so I go to I just visit because I
[2:03:04] he asked me to come and I was down low
[2:03:07] spiritually. So I walk in the church,
[2:03:10] they got screens big, twice as big as
[2:03:12] these. And on the screen it says,
[2:03:14] "Restore unto me the joy of my
[2:03:16] salvation."
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; And I said, "God has got my attention."
[2:03:20] You know, so I go through that and uh
[2:03:24] get get through that and prayed and just
[2:03:27] laid it on my heart that I forgive
[2:03:28] everybody what happened in that
[2:03:30] situation. And uh so I go back I go
[2:03:34] every two months for a blood draw and
[2:03:37] they check me and see where all my
[2:03:39] medicines are and all that. And Ozmpic
[2:03:42] is with my insurance is like uh $2,000 a
[2:03:46] month and I can't afford that or not.
[2:03:50] I'm not gonna take it. But uh she's
[2:03:52] working on the doctor. I go to the
[2:03:55] doctor uh two weeks ago. They drew
[2:03:57] blood. All my numbers are excellent.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; AC1. My blood pressure 117 over 78.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Three times it's been checked and that's
[2:04:07] where it's at. I can run a 100 yard dash
[2:04:10] and not get winded and my doctor told me
[2:04:13] not to do that. But I'm only 71. But
[2:04:17] anyway,
[2:04:19] I almost beat Abby Grace, but she got me
[2:04:23] by three or four steps up in Ohio. But
[2:04:26] anyway, to say that I I went to the
[2:04:28] doctor today and I want to say this
[2:04:33] and I testified with her how the Lord's
[2:04:35] been working. Back when my mother had
[2:04:36] degen of heart disease, she called me
[2:04:38] down the floor one night basement and
[2:04:40] said, "Come pray for me." Her anchors
[2:04:42] were swelling. I laid hands on her
[2:04:44] ankles and they went back to normal. I
[2:04:46] watched that happen.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; And God's worked in my life. I've been
[2:04:50] without jobs. Shut down five plants.
[2:04:52] Never was without a job over a weekend.
[2:04:54] Sister Peggy reminds me that all the
[2:04:56] time, but I'm just telling you, my God
[2:04:58] is real. Amen.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; And yours is too. But I go to the doctor
[2:05:04] today and she says, "U
[2:05:07] all your numbers are great. Your blood
[2:05:09] pressure is 117 over 78, whatever it
[2:05:12] was." And uh so I no longer take any
[2:05:16] insulin.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; No shots. That's been about eight months
[2:05:20] now.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Six months, I guess. No insulin. But
[2:05:24] they said that Ozmpic has a benefit to
[2:05:27] it for heart disease. So they want me to
[2:05:30] get back on that. But I'm just going to
[2:05:31] believe that the Lord's going to work
[2:05:33] that out either way.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; And if it comes or goes, I don't care.
[2:05:36] I'm ready to go.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; It don't matter to me. I just believe
[2:05:39] when my Lord if I lay down, he's going
[2:05:42] to raise me up. And I'm promise that one
[2:05:43] more time.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you, if you're
[2:05:46] struggling with something,
[2:05:49] it is written. You just believe that
[2:05:52] it's been written for you.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; The brother the message we had the other
[2:05:56] day from the brother uh brother Long,
[2:06:01] the book being about you, man, that was
[2:06:04] that struck me. It's just wonderful. The
[2:06:07] message tonight about the rapture and
[2:06:11] I'm I believe that that's and I wanted
[2:06:13] to sing this one song and uh I'll see
[2:06:16] you in the rapture because I believe the
[2:06:19] we've got the word. It's here and it's
[2:06:22] time. Brother Dale talked about we're
[2:06:24] going to go past 2026
[2:06:28] and we're about to enter into it. So
[2:06:31] time is at hand. Amen. Key of D
[2:06:35] on 604.
[2:06:43] I'll stop short it. It's 11:57. We'll
[2:06:45] just sing a just one verse of it.
[2:06:53] If we never
[2:06:56] meet again
[2:06:59] on earth is preious friend.
[2:07:05] If to God we have been true
[2:07:11] and we've lived above all sin.
[2:07:16] Then for us there'll be a meeting.
[2:07:22] There's going to be a greeting.
[2:07:27] [music]
[2:07:28] I'll see you in the rapture
[2:07:33] some sweet day.
[2:07:36] Let's stand.
[2:07:38] See, I'll see you in the rapture.
[2:07:45] I'll see you in the rapture.
[2:07:50] I'll see you at that meeting
[2:07:55] in the air.
[2:08:01] There with our blessed savior
[2:08:07] will [singing] live and reign forever.
[2:08:13] I'll see you in the rapture.
[2:08:18] Sing it one more time.
[2:08:20] [music]
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; I'll see you in the rapture.
[2:08:29] I'll see you in the rapture.
[2:08:35] I'll [music and singing] see you at that
[2:08:38] meeting.
[2:08:40] in [singing] the air
[2:08:46] there with our blessed savior.
[2:08:51] We will live and reign forever.
[2:08:57] I'll see you in the rapture some sweet.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; By the way, I'm I'm down to
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; the [music] rapture. Two baby aspirins.
[2:09:10] That's all I take.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Two baby aspirins. Amen. [applause]
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Went through a lot there in November.
[2:09:20] And
[2:09:22] Sister Johnny passed away a couple weeks
[2:09:24] after brother Boyd had open heart
[2:09:25] surgery. So, but we made it through.
[2:09:28] We're all good. Brother uh
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Boyd, he uh he's been through a
[2:09:35] lot, [clears throat] but you know what?
[2:09:36] He's still standing.
[2:09:38] He's still uh still serving the Lord
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; and still singing the praises of the
[2:09:44] Lord.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. But thank all of you for the
[2:09:47] singing. Wonderful job.
[2:09:51] Pray for our our young people. Uh maybe
[2:09:54] going through some trials and
[2:09:55] tribulations
[2:09:57] that this year, Lord, that some of those
[2:09:58] things will be shed off as our brother
[2:10:01] said that it'll be a place to where we
[2:10:04] can come to where things start
[2:10:06] unfolding. I told you what I tell you.
[2:10:09] Whatever you got inside of you, you got
[2:10:11] to let it out.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; If it's if it's the new birth, then you
[2:10:15] show it to somebody else. If it's the
[2:10:17] devil, ask for the new birth,
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz whatever's inside of you is going to
[2:10:21] carry you wherever you're going.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; And as I told the uh I did a funeral for
[2:10:27] a friend of mine um Saturday and um I
[2:10:31] told him, I said, "You can believe
[2:10:32] whatever you want to." I said, "But I'll
[2:10:34] promise you when you close your eyes on
[2:10:36] this side, you gonna open your eyes
[2:10:38] somewhere else."
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; You ain't just going to go away. You
[2:10:41] going to open your eyes one place or the
[2:10:43] other. You going This is not it.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; But thank God that we know who we are,
[2:10:48] where we're going.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; And we know what we're doing here now.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; So, praise God. We are 12:02. We're in a
[2:10:55] new year, 2026.
[2:10:58] We are in a time that we've never been
[2:11:01] before. Right.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; We've never passed this way before, but
[2:11:04] we're heading through it
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; and we're heading to it. So, thank God
[2:11:08] for a year past and now, thank God for a
[2:11:10] year present.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; So, now we're going to take our
[2:11:13] communion and like again, I said again,
[2:11:15] thank you all for coming. God bless you.
[2:11:18] Uh we love you with the love of the
[2:11:19] Lord. Brother Scott, we'll uh get you
[2:11:21] back and preach for us again because we
[2:11:22] sure do appreciate that message. That
[2:11:24] was good. Very timely and very good. So,
[2:11:26] we appreciate that. Amen. [applause]
[2:11:30] So, let's read our scripture for the uh
[2:11:33] communion that we won't have any
[2:11:34] footwashing tonight. Uh we'll just have
[2:11:36] communion and then when we get finished,
[2:11:38] you can go downstairs and grab you a
[2:11:40] snack or something. But just be careful
[2:11:42] on the highways, be careful on the roads
[2:11:45] and uh watch out. There's a lot more
[2:11:47] crazy people than we are out there.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; So, let's read our 1 Corinthians 11 vers
[2:11:52] 23.
[2:11:53] For I have received of the Lord that
[2:11:55] which also I delivered unto you. That
[2:11:56] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[2:11:58] he was betrayed took bread. When he had
[2:12:00] given thanks, he broke it and said, Take
[2:12:03] heed, this is my body which is broken
[2:12:05] for you. This do in remembrance of me.
[2:12:08] After the same manner also he took the
[2:12:10] cup, and when he had sucked, saying,
[2:12:11] "This cup is the new testament." It
[2:12:14] wasn't the Old Testament. The Old
[2:12:16] Testament was blood of bulls and goats.
[2:12:17] It had nothing to do with the inward
[2:12:19] man. It only covered or capoed covered
[2:12:23] your sins. But this guy right here, he's
[2:12:25] fixing to take it away because it's the
[2:12:28] blood of a man. It's not the blood of a
[2:12:29] man. It's the blood of God.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; And that life inside that blood can come
[2:12:33] back inside the believer like nobody
[2:12:36] else can do. No one else can do this.
[2:12:39] But he's telling them, "This is the new
[2:12:40] testament in my blood. This do you as
[2:12:43] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[2:12:44] me. For as often as you eat this bread
[2:12:46] and drink this cup, you do show the
[2:12:48] Lord's death till he comes. Wherefore,
[2:12:51] whosoever shall eat of this bread and
[2:12:52] drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily
[2:12:54] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[2:12:56] the Lord. But let a man examine himself,
[2:12:59] and so let him eat of that bread and
[2:13:01] drink of that cup. For he that eateth
[2:13:03] and drinkketh unworthily, eateth and
[2:13:05] drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not
[2:13:08] discerning the Lord's body. So let's get
[2:13:09] everything clear tonight before we take
[2:13:11] our communion. For this cause many are
[2:13:13] weak and sickly among you and many
[2:13:14] sleep. For if we would judge ourselves,
[2:13:17] we should not be judged. But when we are
[2:13:20] judged, we are chasened of the Lord that
[2:13:22] we should not be condemned with the
[2:13:24] world. Thank God.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Thank God that we are not condemned with
[2:13:27] the world.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; There's therefore now no condemnation
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Wherefore, my brethren, when you come
[2:13:35] together to eat, tar one for another. If
[2:13:38] any man hunger, let him eat at home. it
[2:13:40] you come not together into condemnation
[2:13:42] and the rest will I set in order when I
[2:13:45] come. It took the Apostle Paul to tell
[2:13:47] us what happened in the upper room
[2:13:49] because it was told by a prophet with a
[2:13:52] vision. He wasn't even in the upper room
[2:13:55] but there were several men there that
[2:13:57] had different commentaries of different
[2:13:58] things but they God gave Paul the
[2:14:01] clarity
[2:14:02] as a prophet
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; to give us the communion and what
[2:14:05] happened. So, um, right now we're going
[2:14:08] to tarry just for a moment and, uh, pray
[2:14:11] one for another
[2:14:13] [clears throat] and let's get all this
[2:14:14] settled. Here we are. Here we are, new
[2:14:16] year. Let's start a new year with a
[2:14:19] clean slate. Let's bow our heads.
[2:14:21] [snorts]
[2:14:30] Lord Jesus, just forgive us of our
[2:14:32] faults and failures. Lord, bless the
[2:14:35] people that are here and the ones that
[2:14:36] are watching in, the ones that couldn't
[2:14:38] be here, I pray that you'd be with them,
[2:14:40] Father. And as we take this communion,
[2:14:42] Lord, may it become a part of us,
[2:14:44] Father. And we realize [clears throat]
[2:14:46] that it took you dying at Calvary to
[2:14:49] save every one of us that's in this
[2:14:50] building. Father, I pray that you'd be
[2:14:52] with us now in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:14:56] The Bible said he took bread and blessed
[2:14:57] it. Dear heavenly father, thank you for
[2:15:00] this bread, Lord. It was made by holy
[2:15:02] hands. I pray now, Lord, it'll be at the
[2:15:04] service of this communion, Father. And
[2:15:07] we pray that you'd be with uh Lord, the
[2:15:09] ones that are partaken, Father, in Jesus
[2:15:11] name. Amen.
[2:15:23] I told you many times that one ministers
[2:15:25] that are here. When I was me and parents
[2:15:29] were kids, we were in the Baptist church
[2:15:30] and dad was a deacon and we would uh
[2:15:36] Brother Scott, they get little wafers in
[2:15:38] the mail and
[2:15:40] excuse me, and they would uh put it in
[2:15:42] the freezer. When they put it in the
[2:15:45] freezer, they'd bring it back out the
[2:15:46] next time we had communion. So, it
[2:15:48] wasn't fresh manta, that's for sure.
[2:15:51] Then we had Welch's grape juice.
[2:15:54] Excuse me. And I think they even cut it.
[2:15:57] Make sure nobody choked on it.
[2:16:00] But that's all they knew. That's
[2:16:02] everything they knew. But thank God for
[2:16:04] truth.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, thank you Lord for this
[2:16:08] wine.
[2:16:09] Lord, it's made Lord to be drank,
[2:16:12] Father. just a small portion to remind
[2:16:15] us, Father, that you shed your blood at
[2:16:17] Calvary.
[2:16:18] And Lord, for the remission of our sins,
[2:16:21] Lord, I pray that you'd be with each one
[2:16:22] in this building, Father. That Lord, as
[2:16:24] we take this communion, we'll remember
[2:16:26] you, Father, and go forward today in
[2:16:28] newness of life. Jesus name we pray.
[2:16:31] Amen.
[2:16:33] [cough]
[2:16:34] [clears throat] Excuse me. Come morning,
[2:16:37] I'll walk.
[2:16:43] I'll rest near the evergreen
[2:16:47] tree.
[2:16:50] I'll carry
[2:16:52] my cross through the midnight.
[2:16:58] [clears throat] Come morning, [singing]
[2:17:00] there's glory
[2:17:03] for me.
[2:17:05] Sometimes I'm despised. Oh, you feel
[2:17:09] that way sometimes, don't we?
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; And I question, oh father,
[2:17:17] how long
[2:17:20] then I take one more look
[2:17:25] at Mount Calvary
[2:17:28] and it gives me the strength to go on
[2:17:36] some morning.
[2:17:39] Boy, what a peaceful thing.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Everything will be over with.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; There'll be no more sorrow, no more
[2:17:46] pain.
[2:17:48] There'll be nothing but just all glory
[2:17:53] will be in eternity.
[2:17:55] But we got to carry a cross now to get
[2:17:57] us there.
[2:18:01] Come morning
[2:18:03] there's glory
[2:18:06] for me.
[2:18:09] Sometimes [singing] I'm despised
[2:18:13] and rejected
[2:18:16] and I question.
[2:18:19] Oh father,
[2:18:21] how long?
[2:18:25] Then I take one more look
[2:18:29] at Mount Calvary
[2:18:33] and it gives me the strength to
[2:18:38] go on.
[2:18:40] While they're giving finishing, I'll
[2:18:42] give you a little testimony, brother.
[2:18:43] Oh, Scott, me and my wife, we flipped
[2:18:46] hamburgers too for a while and uh that's
[2:18:50] kind of how we met. So, thank the Lord
[2:18:51] for McDonald's. So, uh and friends that
[2:18:55] worked there. So, and we didn't kill
[2:18:57] each other while we were working there
[2:18:58] and we didn't have the Lord on our side
[2:19:00] that at that moment. So, so we but we
[2:19:02] made it through now for almost 47 years.
[2:19:05] So,
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; but same way, brother, I uh I had a very
[2:19:08] foul mouth. I I could I could hurt
[2:19:12] people without hitting them. I'd hurt
[2:19:13] him with my with my mouth. And uh and I
[2:19:16] I hate I I didn't hate it at the time,
[2:19:19] but I hate it now. And I'll tell you a
[2:19:22] story just real quick. You talk about
[2:19:24] going through justification,
[2:19:25] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[2:19:26] Ghost, and how God will take these
[2:19:28] things out of your life. I was driving
[2:19:30] down the road. Some of you already heard
[2:19:31] this. I'll tell for the ones that the
[2:19:33] new ones. I was driving down the road.
[2:19:35] This was after I had received the
[2:19:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I was driving
[2:19:39] down the road. I was going from
[2:19:40] Gillsville to to Mazeville and uh I was
[2:19:44] talking to a friend of mine that was I
[2:19:46] had knew that we were both saying the
[2:19:48] same words that that I said. So we were
[2:19:51] buddies, you know. I mean we we said the
[2:19:53] words together and we hunted together
[2:19:54] and fished together and said bad words
[2:19:56] more than we said good words. And uh so
[2:20:00] uh I was talking to Ken and and
[2:20:04] something happened and
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; H
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Why' you throw Ken under the bus? I'm so
[2:20:09] Well, Ken ain't watching this.
[2:20:12] Terrence knows Ken. He's a good buddy.
[2:20:14] He's a You know what? He's a he's a he's
[2:20:16] a guy that I believe a cup of water
[2:20:18] because after I got born again, he never
[2:20:20] shied he never shied away from me. He
[2:20:23] [snorts] never uh he never said anything
[2:20:25] about it about me not hunting on Sunday
[2:20:27] anymore. But going down the road,
[2:20:29] Brother Scott, we were talking about
[2:20:30] something. We were riding we were
[2:20:31] talking about hunting. We were talking
[2:20:33] about getting into going somewhere and
[2:20:35] and something [clears throat] happened.
[2:20:36] a dog run a crossroad or something and I
[2:20:38] started to say oh
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; and I know y'all run that through your
[2:20:41] head already the s word [laughter] and
[2:20:44] when I started to and I was going to say
[2:20:45] it when I when I when that word got
[2:20:47] right here it's like something hit me
[2:20:50] right here in the chest and I just went
[2:20:51] oh
[2:20:53] and that was it. I knew that that was
[2:20:56] gone
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; because the old me would have said it.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Really normally would have said it. But
[2:21:03] when I got ready, the old the old guy
[2:21:05] was still around, the old, you know, the
[2:21:07] old spirit guy. And I got caught up and
[2:21:10] and and God didn't let me do that. He
[2:21:12] hit me right in the chest and blowed all
[2:21:14] the air out of my out of my lungs just
[2:21:17] to protect me.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Just to tell me that he saved me
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; and he changed me.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's take
[2:21:25] communion.
[2:21:35] Amen. God bless you. All right. Give it
[2:21:38] to him.

[2:21:44] service. Yeah. I made that stout. Y'all

[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody see, look at that.
[2:22:01] Everybody's like, "Amen."
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; I think that came from last year. I made
[2:22:07] a better batch this year. So, hey,
[2:22:12] you know what? When I made it, I said,
[2:22:13] "Lord, this is going to be drank by holy
[2:22:15] people, by people that that are that are
[2:22:17] wonderful people." And that might have
[2:22:19] just a little bit extra vinegar in it,
[2:22:20] but you know what? It'll clear your
[2:22:21] throat. Those of you that are sick, if
[2:22:24] you need another one, you can have
[2:22:27] it'll clear you out.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; I wait till they get finished.

[2:23:25] 2025.
[2:23:27] [applause]
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; As our brother said, [applause]
[2:23:33] it's been a struggle. We've had ups and
[2:23:36] downs and ins and outs, but you're
[2:23:37] standing right here capable to hear the
[2:23:41] voice of God still speak to you.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; Then you ought to be the most blessed
[2:23:47] people on the earth. is to know where
[2:23:49] you are, know where it's at,
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; and you know what? Know how to get it.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; It's there for all of us, but only a
[2:23:57] special group of people is going to get
[2:23:58] it.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; As our brother said, the bride of Jesus
[2:24:01] Christ is the only ones going in a
[2:24:03] rapture.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Chris said last
[2:24:06] Sunday, he said, "That's why it's a
[2:24:07] little book that comes down with a
[2:24:09] mighty angel because it's just the names
[2:24:11] of the people that are his bride."
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; John eats the book. And then now here we
[2:24:17] stand. We are the book.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; We're not going to carry Bibles in
[2:24:21] heaven.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; We're not going to carry iPads,
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; iPhones.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be any AI cuz it's
[2:24:31] going to be real.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; But you're not going to need a Bible.
[2:24:34] You're going to be a walking Bible.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; The day of judgment. There's not going
[2:24:38] to be a great big book. You're going to
[2:24:40] be standing there because you're the
[2:24:41] book. [snorts]
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; You're God made manifest in flesh
[2:24:44] through that book.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads just for a second.
[2:24:49] Thank you, Lord.
[2:24:51] We pray that
[2:24:53] everything has been done, Lord, these
[2:24:55] past four hours has been done for your
[2:24:57] honor and glory. Lord, we've sang songs
[2:24:59] and we've seen people pour their heart
[2:25:01] out in worship, Lord, and our our
[2:25:03] brother poured his heart out, Lord, in
[2:25:05] the speaking of the word. Father, I pray
[2:25:07] that it doesn't that it doesn't return
[2:25:08] void, but you said it would. You said it
[2:25:10] would accomplish what it set out to do.
[2:25:13] Father, be [snorts] with each one, Lord,
[2:25:14] as we go downstairs. sanctify the food,
[2:25:16] Lord, and be with us on the highways as
[2:25:19] we go to our separate ways, Father. The
[2:25:21] We know what the world's doing outside,
[2:25:23] Lord. So, just protect us and keep us
[2:25:25] safe, Father. We thank you for this
[2:25:27] building we have. Thank you for the
[2:25:28] congregation that we have, Lord. And we
[2:25:30] pray that you'd be with us now to
[2:25:32] continue [snorts] through 2026 for
[2:25:34] whatever you have for us, Lord. And if
[2:25:36] we don't stand here in 2026, December
[2:25:38] 31st, that'll be just fine. We'll be
[2:25:40] with you.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Father, just bless us now and take care
[2:25:43] of us in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[2:25:45] you. You're dismissed. [snorts]
[2:25:49] Take the name of Jesus with bless you,
[2:25:54] brother. [music] down
