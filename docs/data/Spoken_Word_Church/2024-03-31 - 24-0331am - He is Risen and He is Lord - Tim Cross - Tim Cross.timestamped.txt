[28:44] minute then we'll continue on brother
[28:53] boy sorry for uh being out of order here
[28:57] maybe but I want tell you something
[28:58] about my Jesus 17 years ago today I was
[29:02] leading music right
[29:04] here CU service was nearing an
[29:08] end I raised my hand and a spear come
[29:11] through my back with the worst pain I've
[29:15] ever experienced in my life it was
[29:18] Easter Sunday and we I could barely get
[29:22] through the end of the service and
[29:23] brother uh Dale went with me to the
[29:26] emergency room and we stayed in there
[29:29] about six hours and they couldn't decide
[29:31] what had happened they said well we
[29:32] don't know what it is we can't tell you
[29:34] what it is we don't know we don't think
[29:36] it's
[29:37] cancer we just don't know so they put me
[29:41] in the hospital brother Bob three days
[29:46] later my doctor comes bouncing in a room
[29:50] he says we figured it out it's
[29:53] osteitis and what what osteitis is is
[29:56] the bone in T10 vertebrae my back the
[29:59] bone had died and was dying out and it
[30:03] required me to uh start a treatment of
[30:06] 2500 M bag of vanomas and I had to take
[30:10] it every day every morning before I went
[30:12] to work I'd work all day and go home and
[30:15] cry myself to sleep cuz the pain level
[30:18] was so
[30:20] great and I just think my Jesus
[30:25] Christ endure that pain amen
[30:29] right but here's my
[30:31] point we went through treatments I'd get
[30:34] up at 5:30 in the morning go to for went
[30:36] to work and set an hour in O what is it
[30:40] the oology where Cancer Care was and I
[30:44] got to meet a whole lot of people that
[30:46] had cancer and I'd sat there and take my
[30:49] treatments brother
[30:51] dick he would come there on days in the
[30:54] morning bring his
[30:56] guitar we would sing and praise and
[30:59] testify of the
[31:02] Lord the Lorden and I was uh leading
[31:06] music that Sunday morning because
[31:08] brother de he was in St Joe where he
[31:10] often
[31:12] traveled but you know as I went through
[31:15] that treatment and brother Dale he stood
[31:17] with me he'd come and be at the hospital
[31:18] with
[31:21] me and he never was a man of a lot of
[31:24] words but when he said yep or he he'd
[31:28] say m that's right you
[31:31] knew you knew he was right
[31:34] yeah but through that my
[31:37] faith you won't find anybody that's got
[31:40] greater Faith than I I've
[31:44] worked never missed a day of work I
[31:47] supposed to have 45 days of
[31:50] treatment I'll be quick here in just one
[31:55] second about 20 days in the the
[31:59] treatment they drew blood cuz they had
[32:01] to check my blood every three or four I
[32:04] don't know after three or four
[32:05] treatments they drew blood out checking
[32:08] the level vomi and which was the
[32:11] strongest antibiotic you could
[32:13] take and one one day they drew blood out
[32:17] and The Vow was about that much red
[32:20] blood and the rest was triglycerides is
[32:22] what they told
[32:25] me so I had talked to brother Dale
[32:28] really concerned cuz it ran through my
[32:30] family heart trouble and stuff and uh so
[32:34] I come to church it was a Wednesday
[32:36] night got prayed for my next time I was
[32:40] supposed to draw blood was uh on a
[32:43] Thursday so the came up here and got
[32:47] prayed for and testified what had
[32:50] happened and
[32:52] then next day I go back to have my blood
[32:54] drawn and they said uh I told her before
[32:56] she drew a car little was her name I
[32:58] said now when you draw that blood this
[33:00] time there's not going to be anything in
[33:03] there praise the Lord there was
[33:06] nothing nothing
[33:12] there but here's my
[33:15] point my faith I I've worked all through
[33:19] this and I only ended up having to go
[33:20] through those treatments about 20
[33:22] something days because of God I would go
[33:25] home and I'd go to work and come home
[33:28] and I'd literally cry out to God to take
[33:30] me because the pain was so great I
[33:33] actually had raised my threshold a pain
[33:35] so high that I felt good one day and
[33:37] went out in the pasture with five horses
[33:41] and fell to my knees because my legs
[33:43] paralyzed and I dropped to the ground
[33:46] and the doctor said that I had raised my
[33:48] pain level so high that my muscles just
[33:51] shut down so can't you imagine your lord
[33:55] Jesus Christ on that cross that's right
[33:57] brother being pierced
[34:03] with but that pain that I had in my back
[34:05] was not just a poke it was like a
[34:09] continuous run through and it just lays
[34:12] on my heart that that's what the Lord
[34:14] Jesus Christ took for me and he's still
[34:17] doing the healing
[34:20] Lord this whole body of mine if I get to
[34:24] 3 score1 in December that's all I
[34:26] deserve I don't
[34:30] deserve but I
[34:33] know I know my healer
[34:36] liveth and if you don't know Jesus
[34:42] Christ better get aboard cuz we're
[34:45] taking flight
[34:47] amen thank
[34:52] you he's the same yesterday today and

[52:41] praise the lord we have so much to be
[52:43] thankful for this morning I'll invite
[52:45] you to uh stand
[52:47] and turn with me in the scriptures um I
[52:52] want to read from two places first in
[52:54] Isaiah chapter 60 and then I I didn't
[52:56] write this down brother when I gave you
[52:57] the notes earlier but also Ephesians
[53:00] chapter
[53:01] 2
[53:03] um you know I believe the the
[53:05] resurrection Easter means more to us
[53:08] today sir than it has ever meant to
[53:11] Christians of any age in the past amen
[53:14] because we're living in the in the hour
[53:16] of another
[53:17] Resurrection amen and so we are so
[53:20] grateful I I love to sing that song
[53:23] there's never been a day like this day
[53:26] amen because it's it's evening time but
[53:28] yet the the sun is shining again in its
[53:31] strength amen let's um approach the
[53:35] author of the word once more in prayer
[53:37] Heavenly Father Lord as we come to honor
[53:40] the resurrection this morning we pray
[53:43] father that you will come and join with
[53:45] us in this service Lord walk the aisles
[53:48] and move among our hearts Lord Jesus to
[53:51] declare yourself Lord the Risen Savior
[53:55] Lord our atonement our lamb Lord that
[53:57] bled and died and then raised again Lord
[54:00] for our
[54:01] justification Lord may it take on a
[54:04] newer and greater meaning to each of us
[54:06] today and Lord may your resurrected life
[54:09] come and Quicken us father God and make
[54:12] us and mold us Lord more into your image
[54:15] we ask you to Grant it Lord and we just
[54:18] pray that you will have the preeminence
[54:20] and Lord you will receive glory to
[54:23] yourself for all that is done Lord in
[54:26] this service today Father God May Our
[54:29] Lives be changed father God and we just
[54:32] ask you father to break the bread of
[54:34] life to our hearts now and we thank you
[54:37] for it in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[54:40] amen amen Isaiah chapter 60 verse1 arise
[54:45] amen and Shine for thy light is com amen
[54:50] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[54:54] thee for behold the Darkness shall cover
[54:57] the Earth and gross Darkness the people
[55:01] but the Lord shall arise upon thee and
[55:05] His glory shall be seen upon thee and
[55:09] the Gentiles shall come to thy light and
[55:13] Kings to the brightness of thy Rising
[55:17] amen let's also turn into the New
[55:19] Testament to Ephesians chapter
[55:24] 2 Ephesians 2 I'm sure these are all
[55:28] familiar scripture readings to us but
[55:32] you know the Lord has a way of just
[55:33] quickening these uh portions of his word
[55:36] in in a in a special season amen and and
[55:40] bringing a manifestation from that
[55:43] hallelujah amen Ephesians 2 verse one
[55:46] and you hath he
[55:49] quickened amen there was nothing that
[55:51] could Quicken you but him and you hath
[55:54] he quickened who were dead in trespasses
[55:58] and sins where in time past ye walked
[56:02] according to the course of this world
[56:05] according to the prince of the power of
[56:07] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[56:09] the children of Disobedience among whom
[56:12] also we all had our conversation in
[56:15] times past in the lust of our flesh
[56:18] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[56:22] uh and the of the mind and were by
[56:24] Nature the children of of Wrath even as
[56:27] others but God who is rich in Mercy for
[56:32] his great love wherewith he hath loved
[56:35] us even when we were dead in sins hath
[56:41] quickened us together with Christ by
[56:44] grace are you saved and hath raised us
[56:47] up together and made us sit in Heavenly
[56:53] places in Christ Jesus that in the ages
[56:56] to come he might show the exceeding
[56:59] Riches of his grace in his kindness
[57:03] toward us through Christ Jesus amen may
[57:07] the Lord bless the reading of his word
[57:09] as you're seated this morning amen I
[57:11] want to take for a title this morning he
[57:14] is
[57:15] risen and he is Lord amen now we we
[57:20] believe he has risen and all of
[57:22] Christianity believes he is risen but
[57:24] what is our relationship to him this
[57:27] morning amen he is Lord he's my savior
[57:31] he's my Lord he's my king he's my
[57:34] Redemption he's my salvation amen you
[57:37] know God doesn't just give these things
[57:40] he is these things to the believer and
[57:43] to the Overcomer amen and so we have you
[57:46] know it's just like I said Mary was
[57:48] there and when she came to the tomb she
[57:50] said what have you done with my Lord
[57:53] he's still my Lord I don't care what the
[57:55] world thinks about him I don't care what
[57:57] the rumors are that are swirling I don't
[57:59] care what the Romans are saying or any
[58:01] of the others he's my Lord and if I can
[58:03] just get in his presence again amen and
[58:06] so there there was a relationship that
[58:09] was revealed there now the prophet of
[58:10] God preaches a message in January 12th
[58:13] of
[58:14] 1964 called Shalom and you know the
[58:16] longer we go in time the more we realize
[58:19] how accurate this message is as a
[58:22] prophecy sir amen and what might have
[58:24] seemed true then seems even more true
[58:27] today amen and so he says here in verse
[58:30] in paragraph 41 he says we're facing
[58:32] here and our two subjects that we read
[58:34] the two scriptures rather a contrast one
[58:38] to the other in Isaiah it says arise and
[58:41] shine for the glory of God has come upon
[58:45] you the light is here and then the very
[58:48] next verse says gross darkness is upon
[58:51] this people and then we are in when we
[58:55] are in a mixture
[58:57] that's Kentucky language for you right
[58:58] there we're in a mixery of light and
[59:02] darkness and then my address to the
[59:04] church is Shalom peace let's find out
[59:09] what it's all about see we are facing
[59:12] this year in both Darkness and Light and
[59:16] the world is in one of the most chaotic
[59:18] times of Darkness that it's ever stood
[59:21] in and yet it's standing in again the
[59:24] Most Blessed light that it ever did
[59:26] Shine in the difference is just like it
[59:29] was in the beginning when there was
[59:31] gross Darkness upon the earth and the
[59:34] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[59:38] water and said let there be light and
[59:41] God separated the light from the
[59:43] darkness and I believe that we are now
[59:46] living in that hour again that when God
[59:50] is separating light from darkness and
[59:52] he's pressing it to the other side of
[59:55] the the world that the light might be
[59:59] manifest amen and you know the thing
[1:00:02] about it is when when a message comes
[1:00:04] forth when a prophecy Goes Forth when a
[1:00:07] light shines amen it shines to produce
[1:00:10] something it right amen a prophecy Goes
[1:00:13] Forth to produce an effect amen when
[1:00:16] when when uh you remember when Elijah
[1:00:18] became discouraged amen he was there in
[1:00:20] the mouth of the cave and God said I'm
[1:00:22] going to show you there's 7,000 that's
[1:00:25] been reserved that have not bowed the
[1:00:27] knee to Bell God sent the message for
[1:00:31] somebody God sent the prophet for
[1:00:34] somebody amen there was a prophecy that
[1:00:36] went forth that was going to have an
[1:00:38] effect when God said let there be light
[1:00:42] he wasn't speaking to another planet he
[1:00:44] wasn't speaking to another galaxy he was
[1:00:47] speaking to the Earth because he had
[1:00:50] formed the Earth with potentials that
[1:00:52] lay down on the inside of it and
[1:00:55] regardless what it looked like to an
[1:00:57] onlooker or an outsider God knew
[1:01:00] something was invested there and brother
[1:01:02] he was speaking to the elements he was
[1:01:05] speaking to the conditions he was
[1:01:07] speaking to the environment and the
[1:01:09] atmosphere because he knew when he spoke
[1:01:13] it would have an effect amen and it
[1:01:15] would separate the darkness from the
[1:01:17] light and it would bring something into
[1:01:20] manifestation that before had been a
[1:01:23] mystery amen when Christ was hanging
[1:01:27] there on Calvary Satan thought he had a
[1:01:30] great Victory but what he was but what
[1:01:32] he was doing was making it possible for
[1:01:35] a mystery to be revealed the mysterious
[1:01:40] part of Christ was Miss Jesus Christ
[1:01:43] waiting to be released and expressed
[1:01:46] through the next seven ages and now
[1:01:49] we're living at the climax of
[1:01:51] that we are living in that time and so
[1:01:54] the prophet says we're caught
[1:01:56] between these two
[1:01:58] Realms and we are giving witness or we
[1:02:01] are reflecting this morning one or the
[1:02:04] other you know I was thinking when
[1:02:06] brother Brandon preached the message
[1:02:08] Souls that are in prison now he talked
[1:02:11] about being a child and and having been
[1:02:13] shot and he was dying there laying in a
[1:02:15] pool of his own blood and he went and
[1:02:17] visited the regions of the
[1:02:19] lost and then later amen I believe it
[1:02:22] was in 1961 then he was taken up and saw
[1:02:25] his con s he saw another realm another
[1:02:29] dimension amen but but he said uh and he
[1:02:32] said I in one place he said I believe
[1:02:34] God has let me see both places and one
[1:02:37] of them he said whatever you do don't go
[1:02:40] there and the other one he said whatever
[1:02:42] you do don't miss it amen but here he
[1:02:45] seen now the regions of the Lost there
[1:02:47] is a child amen a young a young boy
[1:02:49] there and and and that was probably in
[1:02:52] the early 1900s maybe the 1910s or the
[1:02:54] 1920s I'm not sure exactly but here it
[1:02:57] is some 40 50 years later he and his
[1:03:01] wife are in a JC Penny and she's
[1:03:03] shopping and he's sitting there on the
[1:03:05] bench and up the escalator comes these
[1:03:08] women with their faces painted and
[1:03:11] making these noises exactly like he saw
[1:03:15] in Vision amen when he was a child there
[1:03:19] in the Realms of the lost so Hell hath
[1:03:23] enlarged itself the realm of the lost
[1:03:26] the regions of the Lost amen are having
[1:03:28] such an influence now amen that it's
[1:03:31] manifesting itself or it's expressing
[1:03:34] itself here on the earth and the prophet
[1:03:37] of God is seeing that he's giving
[1:03:40] witness to that he's said it's not
[1:03:41] coming it's not off in the future we're
[1:03:43] living right now amen the desires of
[1:03:47] Satan amen the ambition of Satan has
[1:03:50] been realized in his subjects here on
[1:03:53] the Earth but at the same time time
[1:03:56] there's another
[1:03:57] desire there's another Power there's
[1:04:01] another reality that is striking the
[1:04:04] Sons and Daughters of God the message
[1:04:07] has come to give
[1:04:09] light Hallelujah the call of the
[1:04:12] bridegroom has come to call a bride to
[1:04:17] Perfection
[1:04:19] hallelujah amen and so there's uh
[1:04:22] brother Solomon preached on Friday night
[1:04:24] I believe he titled the influence
[1:04:26] fluence of the
[1:04:28] Resurrection I spoke last night or
[1:04:30] yesterday afternoon on the witnesses of
[1:04:32] the Resurrection I want to call this
[1:04:34] this morning the
[1:04:36] impact of the
[1:04:38] Resurrection amen you know the natural
[1:04:41] sunrise in the springtime or the Easter
[1:04:43] season is the same Sun that rises every
[1:04:47] other day of the year it's not a
[1:04:50] different ball of fire up in the sky
[1:04:52] it's the same sun and it's the same
[1:04:55] light
[1:04:56] but now it is rising in a certain season
[1:05:00] and the angle or the relationship
[1:05:02] between the Sun and the Earth is such
[1:05:05] that that light shining on the surface
[1:05:07] of the Earth now begins to produce a
[1:05:10] different effect amen it begins to
[1:05:12] produce a different result than it did
[1:05:14] only months or weeks before because
[1:05:17] there's something lying beneath the
[1:05:19] surface of that earth that is quickened
[1:05:22] by the sunlight I believe they call it
[1:05:24] photosynthesis
[1:05:26] it's a response to light that brings
[1:05:30] forth
[1:05:31] life hidden life dormant life life that
[1:05:36] is every much every bit there amen and
[1:05:39] is as much there amen as it was any
[1:05:42] other time of the year but it's being
[1:05:43] called
[1:05:45] for it's being beckoned it's being drawn
[1:05:49] by the power of the light of the sun am
[1:05:53] and it's producing a a different result
[1:05:55] a different effect amen the sunrise in
[1:05:59] this season is bringing a special effect
[1:06:02] or is producing a unique result it's
[1:06:05] calling that life forth from the earth
[1:06:08] it is revealing the hidden
[1:06:11] potentials amen I I I believe that seed
[1:06:14] if we could think of it in this way that
[1:06:15] seed is lying there waiting for that sun
[1:06:17] to strike
[1:06:19] it it's yearning for that it's Desiring
[1:06:24] that it's Desiring that warmth it's
[1:06:27] Desiring those rays and you know we we
[1:06:29] put on sunscreen and we put on hats and
[1:06:31] we put on all these things to protect
[1:06:33] ourselves from that light because it has
[1:06:36] a different effect on our skin but to
[1:06:38] the seed oh my it's Desiring that light
[1:06:43] other things amen May shy away from it
[1:06:45] but the seed says I want more of that
[1:06:48] because it's bringing the results that
[1:06:51] are down on the inside that could never
[1:06:53] be produced any other way amen now the
[1:06:56] prophet of God says this now God
[1:06:59] promised that he would bring his bride
[1:07:03] out what he would do there would be a
[1:07:06] seed and there would be a light in the
[1:07:09] evening time how he would do all these
[1:07:12] things just exactly and by the way that
[1:07:15] he originally planned it in the Old
[1:07:18] Testament and the New Testament and it
[1:07:21] wasn't through
[1:07:23] denomination it wasn't through our
[1:07:26] system we're using today we're causing
[1:07:30] death we're just causing death let
[1:07:33] people put their hands in it and die
[1:07:35] from it remember this was um this was
[1:07:38] the message trying to do God a service
[1:07:40] without it being his will when David had
[1:07:42] a desire to restore the word of the Lord
[1:07:44] to its rightful place but he went about
[1:07:47] it without consulting the channel the
[1:07:50] prophet God has channels that he
[1:07:53] operates through and if you avoid that
[1:07:55] if you disregard that it brings death so
[1:07:59] he had a right desire amen but he didn't
[1:08:01] have the timing and he didn't have God's
[1:08:03] blessing there wasn't God's appointed
[1:08:05] time and God's appointed way so a man
[1:08:07] died as a result of that and brother bam
[1:08:09] said people are dying because we're
[1:08:11] trying to bring it through our system
[1:08:13] and men are putting their hands in it
[1:08:15] and it's causing death but then he says
[1:08:18] the word the evening message oh my must
[1:08:24] carry evening
[1:08:26] results the evening message must sow
[1:08:30] evening seed not morning seed evening
[1:08:34] seed is that right the midday seene its
[1:08:37] seeds back there was denomination it
[1:08:40] died and perished but evening time
[1:08:44] message will produce evening time light
[1:08:48] we'll show evening times results the
[1:08:50] evening time message in Jesus time it
[1:08:53] was a midday message showed midday
[1:08:56] results the beginning message showed the
[1:08:58] beginning results made creation he made
[1:09:01] his son in his own image in the midday
[1:09:03] in the evening time he makes a bride for
[1:09:07] it oh brother amen I I get excited and I
[1:09:13] lose my place but he makes a bride for
[1:09:16] it oh and you've heard me say this
[1:09:18] before but when that when God formed
[1:09:20] Adam in in Eden he uh his mystery was
[1:09:24] still locked up inside him misses Adam
[1:09:29] and then God removed that part of Adam
[1:09:31] that feminist part and her name was Adam
[1:09:33] too and then he brought her to
[1:09:36] him now I don't know how many creatures
[1:09:39] she passed on her way through the garden
[1:09:41] to meet the one she came from but none
[1:09:44] of them could reveal to her where she
[1:09:47] began or where she belonged but him
[1:09:50] amenallah and that I believe that
[1:09:53] represents the Journey of the Believer
[1:09:56] from our natural birth here in this
[1:09:58] earth until we are restored back and we
[1:10:01] are placed back within Christ amen and
[1:10:05] only he can reveal to us who we truly
[1:10:07] are and why we were truly formed and
[1:10:10] what our place in purpose is here on
[1:10:12] this Earth and is to express him Adam
[1:10:15] could not have a family without her amen
[1:10:18] he had power he had created Power he was
[1:10:21] a God here on the Earth but he could
[1:10:23] have no expression he could have no
[1:10:25] extension of himself without her so God
[1:10:29] needs
[1:10:30] you God needs a bride God needs his body
[1:10:34] to manifest his life through
[1:10:39] amen oh my so he makes a bride for it
[1:10:43] what by his word he made her the same
[1:10:47] way he made him oh my I like this too I
[1:10:50] just throw this nugget in there he made
[1:10:52] Adam Out of the Dust of the Earth but he
[1:10:55] didn't make Eve out of dust he made Eve
[1:10:58] out of
[1:11:00] Adam amen he reached into the Earth and
[1:11:03] pulled out 16 elements and breathed the
[1:11:06] spirit of life into it and that made
[1:11:07] Adam but when he made Eve he didn't
[1:11:10] reach into the Earth he didn't reach
[1:11:12] into creation he reached into the the
[1:11:16] first Adam he reached into him and
[1:11:18] pulled out a part of him and made that
[1:11:20] into
[1:11:21] her Hallelujah so it shows you you don't
[1:11:24] come from a Fallen Earth you don't come
[1:11:26] from your the natural relationship
[1:11:29] between your parents you come from God
[1:11:31] as an expression of his very life amen
[1:11:35] hallelujah brother Bram said I was born
[1:11:37] again when I realized I was not the son
[1:11:39] of Charles and El
[1:11:41] Bram praise the lord it's it's deep but
[1:11:44] it's
[1:11:45] powerful how did he form the Earth how
[1:11:48] did he speak it into existence by his
[1:11:50] word who was his son the word in the
[1:11:53] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:11:55] with God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:11:59] dwelt among how will he take his bride
[1:12:02] by his word not by a new cart not by
[1:12:06] some Theologian idea but according to
[1:12:09] his word he'll identify her don't put
[1:12:14] one thing to it or take one thing away
[1:12:16] from it now leave it the way it is the
[1:12:19] evening time he promised he would reveal
[1:12:21] through open these Seven Seals and show
[1:12:25] what them churches had missed back there
[1:12:27] Revelation 10 Malachi 4 St Luke 17:30 he
[1:12:31] said he would do it now let's not mix it
[1:12:34] up let's keep it right like thatl amen
[1:12:38] you know Harvest
[1:12:40] Time Harvest time comes and and if you
[1:12:43] think of it in the fall season and most
[1:12:46] Harvest especially here in North America
[1:12:49] most things we Harvest toward the end of
[1:12:51] the summer or the
[1:12:53] fall so it it is it is harvested right
[1:12:57] as the cold weather is approaching amen
[1:13:00] right as the days are beginning to get
[1:13:03] shorter and and and and the fall time is
[1:13:05] coming or the or the season of death or
[1:13:08] the season of life going back into the
[1:13:10] roots that's when the Harvest time comes
[1:13:14] that's when the fruit reaches full
[1:13:19] maturity that's when a manifold
[1:13:21] expression of the original
[1:13:23] seed comes back into
[1:13:26] view ready to produce the same results
[1:13:29] that the original did is at the evening
[1:13:32] time is at the harvest season amen so
[1:13:35] the Harvest time comes at the end of the
[1:13:38] season right before the coldness sets in
[1:13:41] right as Darkness begins pressing
[1:13:44] coldness begins creeping in oh my but in
[1:13:48] that time amen the farmer is going out

[1:14:45] Reed now brother and sister we can feel
[1:14:48] we can see the darkness pressing amen

[1:14:53] newspaper just look around us in a
[1:14:57] nation that was built on Christian
[1:14:59] principles far from it today we can feel
[1:15:02] it you could you you you don't even have
[1:15:04] to necessarily even go out but if you

[1:15:28] the streets because they don't have
[1:15:30] institutions to contain them all
[1:15:32] insanity is on the rise all of these
[1:15:35] things and so you can feel a great
[1:15:37] spiritual tension you can feel the
[1:15:40] pressure amen our young people deal with
[1:15:42] it people that are sensitive they feel
[1:15:45] it amen and it's causing a great Warfare
[1:15:47] and it's a great struggle amen but the
[1:15:50] darkness is the darkest right before the
[1:15:53] dawn right amen amen but we can feel
[1:15:56] these this pressure of the Demonic
[1:15:58] forces Waring and the world is being
[1:16:02] gathered for the battle of
[1:16:04] Armageddon brother bam said rock and
[1:16:06] roll music is preparing the minds of the
[1:16:10] people for the battle of Armageddon you
[1:16:13] know and some of what is called classic
[1:16:14] rock and roll is pretty tame to some of
[1:16:17] this music that's coming out now I don't
[1:16:19] know if it's because I'm getting older
[1:16:21] or just I don't know but you know
[1:16:23] nowadays you you we walk into a grocery

[1:16:27] station and here it could be country
[1:16:29] music it could be Rock I don't even know
[1:16:31] what what to call the music anymore
[1:16:32] don't even sound like music but the
[1:16:34] lyrics and the words that are coming out
[1:16:36] thought my goodness it's so graphic it's
[1:16:40] so
[1:16:40] vile I mean it's so it's so lwd there's
[1:16:44] no filter
[1:16:46] anymore there's there's nothing held
[1:16:48] back there there there there it doesn't
[1:16:49] there there's no rating there's no way
[1:16:51] Amen to protect amen we're being
[1:16:53] bombarded by it
[1:16:55] every day of our lives in this in what
[1:16:57] used to be a Christian
[1:17:00] Nation you can't deny
[1:17:02] it amen and Satan is expressing himself
[1:17:08] amen the the the very lid has been
[1:17:10] ripped off the kettle brother said
[1:17:13] hell but the bride is
[1:17:15] responding to a risen
[1:17:18] son that light is calling for
[1:17:23] response amen when Jesus raised from the
[1:17:27] dead on that third and glorious Easter
[1:17:29] morning he did not rise
[1:17:33] alone there was more than one empty
[1:17:36] grave there were hundreds if not
[1:17:39] thousands of them amen because the Bible
[1:17:41] says the graves were open and many of
[1:17:45] the saints that slept were raised with
[1:17:50] him
[1:17:51] glory we talked about the Hebrew
[1:17:53] children last night when he appeared in
[1:17:56] the fiery furnace he appeared to
[1:17:58] vindicate their testimony they didn't
[1:18:00] stand for wormwood they didn't stand for
[1:18:02] Michael they stood for him and when he
[1:18:06] when they walked into that fiery furnace
[1:18:08] he appeared in there with them to
[1:18:11] vindicate their witness to stand there
[1:18:14] amen these boys have stood here for me
[1:18:17] and so when he rose on that third and
[1:18:19] glorious Easter morning amen he did not
[1:18:21] rise alone but Abraham raised with him I
[1:18:25] believe Adam raised with him I believe
[1:18:27] Isaiah raised with him I believe job
[1:18:29] raised with him I believe David raised
[1:18:31] with him I believe all of those Saints
[1:18:33] amen they were his Old Testament
[1:18:37] Church they were his Old Testament bride
[1:18:40] friend listen listen when Satan
[1:18:42] interjected in the Garden of Eden the
[1:18:44] serpent seed he did not derail God's
[1:18:47] plan to have a family God was still
[1:18:50] going to have a family God was still
[1:18:52] going to have attributes expressed in
[1:18:54] the Earth and through revelation God was
[1:18:56] going to Quicken them amen and even job
[1:18:59] said though the skin worms destroy my
[1:19:02] flesh yet in my flesh I shall see
[1:19:06] him my eyes Shall Behold Him and not
[1:19:10] another now I'm just preaching I'm off
[1:19:13] my notes but you remember something last
[1:19:15] night faith is proven when it seems that
[1:19:18] he is distant when it seems that he has
[1:19:21] withdrawn or when it seems that he is
[1:19:23] absent that's when faith is
[1:19:25] proven that's when faithfulness amen is
[1:19:28] put to the TK good to see you brother
[1:19:29] God bless you amen so here I I just want
[1:19:32] to say this on
[1:19:33] Saturday when the Earth was quiet cold
[1:19:37] and dark and all the disciples had gone
[1:19:39] back to their former way of life and
[1:19:40] everybody else was weeping and mourning
[1:19:43] there was something going on in another
[1:19:45] realm unseen to this realm here on the
[1:19:48] earth Jesus was doing the work of
[1:19:52] redemption and he was going to hell
[1:19:55] visiting the souls that were there in
[1:19:56] prison and he was condemning those who
[1:19:59] had rejected the message of their
[1:20:02] hour he didn't save anybody who rejected
[1:20:05] Noah's
[1:20:06] message but he could find them there
[1:20:09] permanently and eternally to be lost for
[1:20:13] rejecting his
[1:20:15] witness in his
[1:20:18] day he didn't save any lost but he
[1:20:23] redeemed he
[1:20:25] restored there was a knock on the door
[1:20:28] and that's when Ezekiel said that's the
[1:20:31] wheel in the middle of the
[1:20:32] wheel see they all saw him in a
[1:20:34] different form or expression but it was
[1:20:37] him and he said Satan I'm here to take
[1:20:40] mine amen out of paradise back to Earth
[1:20:44] and then we're going to take it's a
[1:20:45] prefigure of the
[1:20:47] Rapture amen so brother and sister it
[1:20:49] may not look like a whole lot's going on
[1:20:51] right now but there is a whole lot going
[1:20:53] on a PR is being perfected faith is
[1:20:57] being proven amen Enoch is Walking with
[1:21:00] God every day amen tuned to the word
[1:21:04] listening to the word responding to the
[1:21:06] word and the word Revival is going on in
[1:21:10] the heart of the Bride right
[1:21:13] now amen I believe that amen that risen
[1:21:17] son he brought his body he brought those
[1:21:20] Old Testament Saints with him his
[1:21:22] resurrection Vindicated his body yeah
[1:21:26] not just one not just the the the son of
[1:21:29] Joseph and Mary not just the body that
[1:21:31] was formed in the womb of Mary but his
[1:21:33] spiritual body his believer they were
[1:21:36] connected with him and when he raised
[1:21:39] they rose with him he Vindicated their
[1:21:42] faith by bringing them he led captivity
[1:21:45] captive amen I don't have the scriptures
[1:21:48] but it's the truth they were you know as
[1:21:51] children they play Follow the Leader
[1:21:53] yeah they follow their leader the one
[1:21:56] that led him in the form of the pillar
[1:21:58] of fire the one that led him through
[1:22:00] Egypt or from Egypt to the Canaan land
[1:22:02] amen he rose and they followed him
[1:22:05] praise the Lord and so he we know that
[1:22:09] brother Brandon preached the message it
[1:22:10] is the rising of the Sun and he brought
[1:22:13] out Christ as being the
[1:22:15] Fulfillment of that wav sheath amen I
[1:22:19] love that
[1:22:20] brother you know because some people
[1:22:22] have the uh the idol
[1:22:25] idea that when God does something he
[1:22:28] just does it to make one person one
[1:22:30] figure or one character the centerpiece
[1:22:32] or the focal point and everybody else
[1:22:35] just looks at that and admires that my
[1:22:38] on praise God for what he did in brother
[1:22:40] SE and
[1:22:41] so but God don't do it for that
[1:22:45] reason Jesus said because I live you
[1:22:49] shall live also he said the works that I
[1:22:52] do shall you do also he wasn't raising
[1:22:56] amen just to vindicate himself but he
[1:22:58] was going to have a Vindicated Ministry
[1:23:02] in redeemed Sons and Daughters of God
[1:23:05] that he would leave here on the earth oh
[1:23:07] glory to God
[1:23:09] hallelujah amen I will not leave you
[1:23:13] comfortless if I go away I will return
[1:23:16] and receive you to myself that where I
[1:23:19] am there you may be also let not your
[1:23:22] heart be troubled you believe in God
[1:23:25] believe also in me I go to prepare you a
[1:23:30] place I go to make possible Hallelujah
[1:23:34] the return of my spirit into you as a
[1:23:37] church amen that I can have the
[1:23:39] preeminence here on Earth and redeem
[1:23:42] people I just I just got to say it amen
[1:23:45] when he appeared to to to when he
[1:23:47] appeared to Simon he said who are you
[1:23:50] Lord when he appeared to to to Peter or
[1:23:53] excuse me to Paul Simon Saul there you
[1:23:56] go I knew it started with an
[1:23:58] S when he appeared to Saul he said I'm
[1:24:02] Jesus whom thou persecutest Saul had
[1:24:05] never met Jesus
[1:24:07] Christ in a physical form but he had met
[1:24:10] him in Bride
[1:24:12] for and he was persecuting that
[1:24:15] church will we sing that song I'm in
[1:24:17] this church it's a glorious church
[1:24:20] that's what he was telling
[1:24:22] Saul I'm in that church
[1:24:25] they're a glorious Church they didn't
[1:24:27] join they were born they had a new birth
[1:24:30] and he said when you're persecuting them
[1:24:32] you're persecuting me because that is
[1:24:36] his body here upon the Earth living
[1:24:39] moving and dwelling and his Spirit had
[1:24:42] come into them to Quicken those
[1:24:46] potentials
[1:24:47] Hallelujah the light of the word the
[1:24:50] light of Jesus ministry amen had shown
[1:24:53] upon them to Quicken them to express the
[1:24:56] same life by this shall all men know
[1:24:59] that you're my disciples when you have
[1:25:02] love one for
[1:25:04] another praise the Lord so I'm going
[1:25:07] back to that wave sheath and we know
[1:25:09] what the wave sheath was when you had a
[1:25:11] field of wheat or barley or whatever it
[1:25:13] was I guess wheat would be the best
[1:25:16] type they would go and pluck up the
[1:25:18] first one that came to
[1:25:20] maturity and bring it to the high priest
[1:25:23] and he would wait as a wave offering
[1:25:25] before the Lord to be
[1:25:29] accepted and when it was accepted
[1:25:32] brother Louise Not only was it
[1:25:36] accepted but the entire
[1:25:39] crop the entire field was
[1:25:44] accepted before the Lord because you
[1:25:47] know he he didn't have to go gather the
[1:25:49] whole field at that time he just
[1:25:52] gathered the one yes but it testified
[1:25:55] there's more just like
[1:25:57] me there's more of the same genetics
[1:26:00] there's more with the same DNA there's
[1:26:02] more with the same potentials and when
[1:26:05] that one is accepted and waved amen when
[1:26:09] it's waved and accepted and God
[1:26:11] testifies of its acceptance he's not
[1:26:14] just accepting that one he's accepting
[1:26:17] all of the others amen who have seen
[1:26:21] that sheep wave before them and it also
[1:26:24] gives them hope it also gives them faith
[1:26:28] it is the rising of the sun if I be
[1:26:32] lifted up now we're seeing the revealing
[1:26:35] of the son of man it wasn't a man it
[1:26:38] wasn't Willam Bram it wasn't a child
[1:26:41] with a seventh grade education it was
[1:26:43] the ministry of the son of man it was
[1:26:46] Christ amen who had raised risen in a
[1:26:49] Ministry to be waved before God and
[1:26:53] accepted amen
[1:26:55] am I going too fast when he went beyond
[1:26:58] the curtain of time he said are these
[1:27:00] Broms he said no too many of them these
[1:27:04] are your converts that were won to
[1:27:07] Christ by your
[1:27:08] ministry and Paul's following Paul's
[1:27:11] followers will be judged by the message
[1:27:14] that he preached and they
[1:27:16] accepted and yours will
[1:27:19] too and they said if you are accepted
[1:27:22] and you will and you will
[1:27:26] it was a foregone conclusion friend this
[1:27:29] ain't a fair
[1:27:30] fight we are decided
[1:27:34] winners we've been made conquerors
[1:27:37] through him that loved us amen but but
[1:27:40] but you're giving witness that you have
[1:27:43] the same life done inside of you when
[1:27:45] you say
[1:27:46] Amen to the waved sheath or the waved
[1:27:51] word it's too hot for some but for the
[1:27:54] seed they're longing for that because
[1:27:58] that sun is bringing that wheat to
[1:28:00] maturity to Perfection and it's caus
[1:28:02] it's making the shuck pull away it's
[1:28:05] making all the unbelief pull away
[1:28:07] because he's only interested in one
[1:28:09] thing and that's the Perfection of what
[1:28:12] was originally placed in the ground and
[1:28:15] when that is displayed it's
[1:28:18] taken brother it's taken in the Harvest
[1:28:21] there was uh the wave sheath gave test
[1:28:24] to that let me let me read a few more
[1:28:26] things to you is this all right
[1:28:32] Amen Let me see if
[1:28:35] I'm yes the wave sheath as Christ was
[1:28:39] the first one to raise from all the
[1:28:41] prophets and so forth although typed in
[1:28:43] many places he was the first fruits of
[1:28:47] those that
[1:28:49] slept in the bride coming of Christ out
[1:28:53] coming out of the
[1:28:55] church they'll have to be a sheath waved
[1:29:00] again in the last days oh my waving of
[1:29:04] the sheath what was the sheath the first
[1:29:08] one that come to
[1:29:10] mature the first one that proved it was
[1:29:14] a wheat that proved it was a sheath
[1:29:17] Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm
[1:29:19] talking about it was waved over the
[1:29:22] people and for the first time that will
[1:29:25] come forth for the bride age for a
[1:29:29] resurrection out of dark
[1:29:32] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:29:36] the full maturity of the word has turned
[1:29:40] back again in its full power and being
[1:29:43] waved over the People by the same signs
[1:29:47] and wonders that he did back
[1:29:50] there is there any difference between
[1:29:53] the ministry that we received and the
[1:29:55] original Ministry of Christ 2,000 years
[1:29:57] ago no there's not one bitter difference
[1:30:00] if anything it's
[1:30:03] greater amen these signs shall you do
[1:30:07] and greater it's been a greater and it
[1:30:09] doesn't take anything away from the
[1:30:11] original it's the
[1:30:13] Fulfillment it's a
[1:30:15] proof you are the proof remember the
[1:30:18] coin last night there's a Dye amen
[1:30:21] there's an element there's a material
[1:30:23] but there's many
[1:30:25] that are stamped out and they're placed
[1:30:27] into circulation and they have the same
[1:30:30] worth they have the same value they have
[1:30:33] the same
[1:30:35] substance that the original
[1:30:37] had Jesus said because I live you shall
[1:30:41] live also you are going to be the
[1:30:43] remaining proof in the earth that he
[1:30:46] lives nobody has to go to Israel nobody
[1:30:49] has to see an empty tube they can see
[1:30:51] you the Life of Christ Liv through
[1:30:55] you and it has a compelling effect if I
[1:30:59] be lifted up I'll draw a men you're not
[1:31:02] going to win people with your knowledge
[1:31:04] you're not going to win people amen with
[1:31:06] your legalism but the Life of Christ
[1:31:10] will draw them draw them to him Lord let
[1:31:13] it let it radiate through me through you
[1:31:18] amen same signs and wonders
[1:31:20] because I live ye shall live also
[1:31:24] speaking to his wife what a resurrection
[1:31:28] that was and what a resurrection this is
[1:31:32] to be quickened from the dead to be made
[1:31:35] alive in Christ Jesus by God's
[1:31:37] quickening power he was waved to them
[1:31:42] the word which he was was waved back to
[1:31:44] them on the day of Pentecost the word
[1:31:46] made manifest you see brother bam said
[1:31:48] Pentecost was another
[1:31:50] waving amen you know you don't Harvest
[1:31:54] all your field in one day
[1:31:56] typically you harvest them as they
[1:31:58] mature and you'll have sections of that
[1:32:01] field that will mature first because of
[1:32:03] the way the sunlight because of the
[1:32:05] irrigation the rain all these various
[1:32:07] factors affect the Readiness of the
[1:32:11] field amen so he was raised as first
[1:32:14] fruits we'll get to it here in just a
[1:32:16] minute but on the day of Pentacost here
[1:32:18] was
[1:32:19] 120 they come out of the upper room
[1:32:22] waving again yeah
[1:32:25] and Peter was waved oh my and Peter was
[1:32:29] waved in the world said uhoh
[1:32:32] fanaticism let's pull up his track
[1:32:34] record this is the one that denied him
[1:32:37] this is the one that cursed this is the
[1:32:39] one that swore this was the one that is
[1:32:41] the moment any pressure was applied he
[1:32:43] was off he was gone he he fled he
[1:32:46] departed and this same Peter is
[1:32:48] staggering out the upper room like a
[1:32:49] drunk man let's see what he's got to
[1:32:52] say huh
[1:32:54] the world is taking a critical view to
[1:32:57] the furtherance of the Gospel the world
[1:33:00] is taking a critical view to the life of
[1:33:03] the sheath now being lived in other
[1:33:06] Wheats other other manifestations in the
[1:33:09] world said what mean this and Peter said
[1:33:12] I'm sorry let me let me let me go back
[1:33:14] up here into the upper room and draft an
[1:33:16] apology and a
[1:33:19] recusal let no he wasn't backtracking
[1:33:22] because this wasn't Peter
[1:33:24] this was the same
[1:33:26] life this was the same life that had
[1:33:30] been in Jesus Christ was now living
[1:33:32] through Peter and speaking through Peter
[1:33:35] and he said these men aren't drunk as
[1:33:37] you suppose now y'all heard me say this
[1:33:39] before he didn't deny they were drunk no
[1:33:41] he didn't he just said they ain't drunk
[1:33:43] the way you think they are they were
[1:33:45] absolutely drunk it was a stimulation of
[1:33:48] fornica stimulation to Revelation not
[1:33:50] natural wine not natural stimulation but
[1:33:53] it was a stimulation of spiritual
[1:33:56] spiritual quickening of the word amen
[1:33:59] and so what did Peter do he said this is
[1:34:03] that he leap frogged over Jesus and went
[1:34:06] all the way back to Isaiah with
[1:34:09] stammering lips and other tongues will I
[1:34:11] speak to this people this is that he
[1:34:15] brought a prophecy off the page and said
[1:34:18] I am living the message of the
[1:34:22] prophet now what's going on in the
[1:34:25] bride's Revival she's not just quoting
[1:34:27] quotes she's not just playing tapes but
[1:34:30] the literal expression of what was on
[1:34:33] those pages has come forth in a bride
[1:34:37] manifestation
[1:34:39] hallelujah
[1:34:41] hallelujah this is that and what 3,000
[1:34:44] Souls were added to the church that day
[1:34:46] just that waving of 120 brought a
[1:34:49] manifold effect to produce the same life
[1:34:53] amen oh I love this Satan tried to stomp
[1:34:55] it out he is he's almost as determined
[1:34:59] as he is
[1:35:02] dumb and he thinks you can stamp it out
[1:35:05] you can stomp it out you can apply
[1:35:08] persecution and
[1:35:09] tribulation but it's just like a
[1:35:12] dandelion any of y'all ever seen a
[1:35:14] dandelion you know a dandelion is a weed
[1:35:18] if you want a blue ribbon Southern Homes
[1:35:20] and live living lawn you don't fill it
[1:35:22] up with Dandy lines and
[1:35:25] daffodils you want nice green grass
[1:35:27] right a dandelion is a weed so here you
[1:35:30] are going along in your
[1:35:31] mower there's a
[1:35:34] dandelion I'm gonna get rid of that
[1:35:37] thing and you mow over top of it and you
[1:35:40] didn't kill
[1:35:42] anything you just made about a thousand
[1:35:44] Dandy
[1:35:46] lions and you dispersed him and that's
[1:35:49] exactly what Satan
[1:35:51] did the moment he tried to stomp us out
[1:35:55] stamp us out or shut us up he just
[1:35:58] spreads us a little further the
[1:36:00] influence just goes a little further
[1:36:03] amen amen Oh my he was that waved sheath
[1:36:09] I think I'll just uh jump over here now
[1:36:11] to Acts chapter
[1:36:13] one praise the Lord I'm like a real
[1:36:16] estate agent I am
[1:36:19] closing it may be 45 60 or 90 days but I
[1:36:23] am
[1:36:25] closing but I pray when we're done we're
[1:36:27] in a new
[1:36:29] house amen praise the
[1:36:34] Lord praise the Lord Acts chapter one we
[1:36:37] find it
[1:36:38] here praise the Lord all right you shall
[1:36:43] receive power now they had power but
[1:36:45] he's talking about another Power they
[1:36:48] had an anointing that had come to them
[1:36:50] by the spoken word but Judas had the
[1:36:52] same anointing but Judas wasn't here for
[1:36:55] this address he had already manifested
[1:36:57] what he was and was dead and gone but
[1:37:00] you shall receive power I mean acts 1
[1:37:02] chapter verse 8 you shall receive power
[1:37:04] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[1:37:06] you and you shall be Witnesses unto me
[1:37:10] amen both in Jerusalem and in all Judea
[1:37:13] and in Samaria and in the uttermost unto
[1:37:15] the uttermost part of the earth and
[1:37:17] while he had spoken these things while
[1:37:19] th while they
[1:37:20] beheld that body that they love
[1:37:24] and adored and slept with and fished
[1:37:27] with and oh they were so attached he was
[1:37:31] taken
[1:37:32] up and the
[1:37:34] cloud received him out of their sight
[1:37:37] and while they looked steadfastly toward
[1:37:40] Heaven as he went up behold two men
[1:37:43] stood by them in white apparel I wonder
[1:37:46] if it wasn't the same two that met Mary
[1:37:49] in the Tomb I don't know right but you
[1:37:53] know they'll always point you to where
[1:37:54] Christ
[1:37:56] isely you remember that they were there
[1:38:00] there there's a nugget those angels said
[1:38:03] he was here but he's not here
[1:38:06] anymore and here's these two
[1:38:08] angels saying he was here and you just
[1:38:12] seen him disappear but they're going to
[1:38:14] point them to where he
[1:38:16] is am those two angels stood by the
[1:38:20] white perel and also said ye men of
[1:38:21] Galilee why stand ye gazing up into
[1:38:24] heaven now a very similar Jesus will
[1:38:29] return one almost like him we'll call
[1:38:32] him the third person of the
[1:38:36] godhead he'll be so
[1:38:39] close no what did the angel say this
[1:38:44] same
[1:38:47] Jesus well if he's the same then there
[1:38:50] can be no difference he's the same in
[1:38:52] his power
[1:38:54] he's the same in his ability he's the
[1:38:56] same in his righteousness he's the same
[1:38:58] in his love his character his nature
[1:39:01] everything is the
[1:39:03] same this same
[1:39:06] Jesus amen this same Jesus which is
[1:39:11] taken up from you into heaven shall so
[1:39:15] come in like manner as ye have seen him
[1:39:18] go into
[1:39:19] heaven then returned they unto Jerusalem
[1:39:23] from the Mount of Olives which is from
[1:39:25] Jerusalem a Sabbath Day's Journey and
[1:39:27] when they were come in they went into an
[1:39:29] upper room where both Peter James John
[1:39:32] Andrew Philip all those remaining 11
[1:39:35] disciples and Peter rallied them and
[1:39:37] they chose a 12th disciple but that was
[1:39:39] their choice before the Holy Ghost came
[1:39:43] they made an appointment to a disciple
[1:39:46] but when the Holy Ghost came he chose
[1:39:48] Paul he chose Saul amen but what we're
[1:39:52] we're we're watching the the stage being
[1:39:55] set for what the sheath pointed
[1:39:59] to what the wave sheath testified was

[1:51:17] did I don't know that Luther was was
[1:51:20] conscious of the fact he would lead the
[1:51:24] Protestant
[1:51:25] Reformation with a little tiny
[1:51:29] tidbit of light that's shown upon the
[1:51:32] scripture to say the just shall live by

[2:03:47] good minister of the gospel and our
[2:03:49] young brother here my mama bragged on
[2:03:51] you
[2:03:54] that might not mean something to you but
[2:03:55] everybody else we know you know brother
[2:03:58] Bob one time you get that nod from Nanny
[2:04:00] and it's that's good that you got the
[2:04:02] seal of approval like you got the stamp
[2:04:05] bro that's right so you're good but uh
[2:04:08] we love you we appreciate you we
[2:04:10] appreciate God getting you a lot quicker
[2:04:12] than the devil did amen and putting you
[2:04:14] in the ministry so you can help people
[2:04:16] amen so we appreciate you God give you
[2:04:18] strength and keep you strong you get old
[2:04:20] like me and Tim it takes God to keep us
[2:04:22] strong and keep us cuz our body just
[2:04:23] falling
[2:04:25] apart but love you love you brother and
[2:04:28] sister amen you know don't ever forget
[2:04:30] what God we can talk about seals and
[2:04:32] plagues and vials and Daniel 70 weeks
[2:04:34] and we can go into all that and that's
[2:04:35] fine because the book's open we can
[2:04:37] preach that but don't brother Brown said
[2:04:39] don't ever forget
[2:04:40] Calvary don't ever forget the basis of
[2:04:44] why we're here is that man 2,000 years
[2:04:47] ago died resurrected and as the song
[2:04:51] said
[2:04:52] we were deservant of everything that he
[2:04:55] got right we deserved every bit of it
[2:04:58] right we deserved to be humble we
[2:04:59] deserve we deserve to be uh smitten
[2:05:01] stricken we deserved every bit of that
[2:05:04] but he said no I'll take it on me bring
[2:05:07] it to me H because you know what I'm the
[2:05:10] mighty conqueror and I can just not
[2:05:12] conquer for myself right I'm going to
[2:05:15] give it to a group of people and let
[2:05:16] them
[2:05:17] conquer brother Tim if Satan would have
[2:05:19] left Jesus alone yeah he' just died an
[2:05:22] old
[2:05:24] man come on he would have lived his life
[2:05:26] cuz there was no we know what his
[2:05:28] purpose was but if Satan would have left
[2:05:29] him alone but he said no I'm going to
[2:05:31] kill him so he tells the Pharisees kill
[2:05:32] him tells the Jews turn him down tells
[2:05:34] this one hey we want we don't want we
[2:05:36] want Barabas we don't want him hang him
[2:05:38] on the cross right but the problem was
[2:05:41] that was one that's right sir about 50
[2:05:45] days later Satan had 121 he had to deal
[2:05:48] with 120 plus Jesus then he just stayed
[2:05:52] around another few minutes and there was
[2:05:53] 3,000 little jesuses he had to deal with
[2:05:56] he has gone
[2:05:58] Bonkers cuz like brother T said every
[2:06:00] time you mash something every time you
[2:06:02] mash a Christian what happens if he if
[2:06:05] it's a true Christian right if you get
[2:06:08] mashed yes sir you just bring out more
[2:06:11] that's right right how do you really you
[2:06:13] know a rose you can smell it and it
[2:06:15] smells really good but you take and
[2:06:16] crush it take that alabaster box that
[2:06:19] that Mary had she had to open it yeah
[2:06:22] those spices though before she opened
[2:06:25] it were flowers and oil and it had to be
[2:06:29] squeezed out that's the way me and you
[2:06:31] are we have to be squeezed before we can
[2:06:34] show the Lord so if we go through trials
[2:06:37] and tribulations can we just raise our
[2:06:39] hand and say thank you God thank you God
[2:06:43] thank you God we we all we hate we hate
[2:06:45] we hate it we really don't like it but
[2:06:47] it's for your Perfection if God's
[2:06:50] perfect yes sir I said if God's perfect
[2:06:54] he never makes a wrong move right and if
[2:06:56] you're a Christian like brother Tim said
[2:07:00] you were in
[2:07:01] Christ the part that's in you is the
[2:07:03] same part that was in
[2:07:05] him amen so all he's doing is is
[2:07:08] bringing that part out of your humanity
[2:07:10] and letting the world see why do y'all
[2:07:13] act this way why why are you acting this
[2:07:17] way why why you go to church on
[2:07:19] Friday why do don't go to church all the
[2:07:22] time I wish we went s days a
[2:07:25] week that's the way I see it the girl
[2:07:28] said one time she said I left the church
[2:07:30] cuz a preacher preached over 30
[2:07:32] minutes oh I was in a I was in a a
[2:07:35] dentist office and they were working on
[2:07:37] my teeth and I told the lady I said hang
[2:07:40] on just a minute I need to say something
[2:07:42] I ra he raised that thing up I said lady
[2:07:45] let me tell you something little
[2:07:46] righteous indignation I said let me tell
[2:07:48] you something I said the person you're
[2:07:50] supposed to be worship
[2:07:52] in hung on a cross for 3
[2:07:55] hours right with Nails in his hands
[2:07:59] side all beat all the pieces brother BR
[2:08:02] said look like hamburger meat I said you
[2:08:04] can't sit 30 minutes for somebody to
[2:08:05] tell you about what that guy did I said
[2:08:08] you're not even a
[2:08:10] Christian I think she quit I think she
[2:08:12] left Dr Amy said she wasn't around
[2:08:14] anymore so but that's that you need to
[2:08:17] look at it that way if if if Jesus
[2:08:19] Christ can hang on three hours on the
[2:08:20] cross
[2:08:22] from 3 to 6 he hang that that long on
[2:08:24] the cross just to save your soul yes you
[2:08:28] can sit and listen to the gospel being
[2:08:30] preached and should be happy when we
[2:08:33] come together like this be happy when we
[2:08:35] come together and and Worship the Lord
