========================================

ow okay everybody see my burning bush much the burning bush turn out like this okay so what I want to talk to you about is burning bush it's the importance of having a place that you make along with God and regular basis you all know how important that is so I'm just reiterating with Jordan oh thank you duo in a magnifying let me up come on tell you yeah go away it's tough but you can do it again I just got one word a few words just for illustration not that don't go through this enough they're going to hate that [Music] this is for pandemic this for pandemic I made up that poor ray or what happens typically to all of that I say what's going on is we tend to pitch for everything back to the last personal prayer ministers say that that you know you tend to pitch for folks maybe the good things but also when you hear bad things brought out the Bible's our nature we tend to say well that's somebody else that's not me all right pitchfork pandemic an epidemic [Applause] well pandemic is an epidemic over a wide area exist everywhere okay so nobody's really excluded epidemic is a widespread outbreak of infectious disease many people aren't saved at the same time we call extends you can call it whatever but the fact is it's an infection you can call it also like slumbering you know we're descriptions were experience lick sometimes and the Lord has congratulate waking us up you know bring us to the reality of seeing what's going on I know brother Darryl is preaching and while he preached and he said if two groups of people in our church okay and this is happening everywhere I think that there are some who are catching what's happening what's going on and where they're at and some people who are just totally asleep spiritually nothing wrong with that person mentally it's just the fact they have to open up yet spiritually to catch what's happening it has one of the real situation here with a lot of things that they were taking about a champion rapture that we will miss if we don't catch our name and see what's happening okay waking up spirit and way to do that and Bernie book a purple okay not only that but that's a big part of it so all in consideration in the Bible is basically two people right or too careful you have dollar and math all right and where the land part where the humans are so really we have to consider everything in the Bible that still retains up is that so it's risen to its relative and kind so don't teach forty back similar to go to man I go to somebody else because you're female being okay so we know what we're talking about and everybody that's really small and you'll see that migrated perforating the big smile it's not just looking at Pizza head we're creating a big mountain know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God we'll all serve this emphasizing such were some of you but you're lost which ye are sanctified as you're justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God my question is can you be sure that those things don't still apply to you are you sure that you've been washed sanctified justified you may be Lord Jesus Christ okay because to me if you ever come to a position where you stop and you don't continue on with God you're backslidden or they'll always say not contain will for if you stop then you're not moving on God your back foot so better come to a state where you say I'll wait on that last thing to come and we are but if we're not ready when that last state comes in and through the code so the fact is you have to continue progressing don't ever stop okay that's what I tell all the tarps on never stop seeing gothis been my life theme for twenty years I gave a heart Florida 12 years old and at 15 I set out on a journey three miles every day contained a sick dog for there wanted more of you destroy the church you know one more than just you know just a basic Christian life that normally don't say anymore and dangerous never stop same Corinthians 11:3 but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that it been from I love that first for part of note in your simplicity one thousand example hides and subtlety crossbodies complicity in both cases you see that nothing spiritual is real obvious to the flesh there's no big spiritual billboard with flashing so you know this is daughter this is the devil it's all very almost undetectable to the flesh and the Bible doesn't refer to Christ that throw a settlement wise deception right so the vowel or for us to Satan when certain is so because he's a deceiver but he works in our members and solty also because he actually hide in that way and deception so much that we sometimes don't even detect we don't even know he's working and then Bryce - simplicity so much that you can't realize sometimes that he's working under lock and you'll overlook something that's great to have him here I just think that was just blinking really think about spiritual things and although I thought this just this way look God has supposedly often fail to detect the devil in this little device too often we get hung up or discouraged from studying the use excuses like these and I've done lobby okay sir all my students origin timing media because the past nature are not saying not condescending or anything would you say some people will say I'm too dumb to understand you know the seven seals the great big deep thing is a domestic some people I understand that's the white rock I have for reading homer and that's been one of my biggest thing hold on I can read a whole page is something not taking anymore about it when I'm done to my started so I have to go back and reread and reread and reread yeah sometimes I'll read the Bible chapter two my daily reason I'll just hope I'll realize halfway through and I didn't get anything so I buy your service now our duty is to read studying make ourselves available to him to ability and plugs to both of these things so your two dollars say you have full reading comprehension okay Bobby you just keep keep studying it takes too much time well it does take time you have to spend time o'clock okay we don't get instant gratification but we found said not to say too much I get confused as to why people get hung up on that because I can't find what he said not to say all right I don't know where brother bang said not to study and I literally been hit he said this is from question answer is 54 or 3:00 in the morning now I meant that people study too much and try to get too far ahead and try to think too hard and sometimes that mental breakdowns and thing on account of studying about the Lord he must quit that okay you don't have to do that the only thing you have to do is fall in love with him and just go right on loving and then it's not trying to push into something to make yourself something you're not just go ahead and let God use you and lay officer is yield yourself to mentor self and walk on happy singing endorsing that's the way and so he said must quit that quit what commentator things out time to reason about the work done just keep studying though I don't think he's gonna stop say frankly if there is such a thing that's reading too much I don't think we have to worry about their name jam with my school time I've done be lumber three months we just don't stop I do fall in love with you know brother Chris long you came creature from months ago Arlo the way he previously said about doing everything with you he said you don't have to but you'll want to you don't have to you know rebound praying dumb jerk but you want to and the Lord doesn't need us but he wants them his below there is a Pope from us we put a watch to fall in love with someone you must get to know that you must read the love letter okay suppose I were talking about missus you have any anymore just almost something after a lovely and time will tell so the objective and lesson today is to see the importance of having a proper place where you meet with God our regular basis have fellowship or commune with him so I think this is the picture by the band was referring to when he talked often about that artist painting where the the door handle is on the inside and they're like 3:20 says the holistic door knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with Nana me to paint so this is something that were promoting this is on your part prices they're ready to come into you in Suffolk you I will come in to him living in Wellington in you but your job is open the door I simply do that by bowring prayer from the church but some sermons always okay so there are 29 playing on other go folks a lot see secret things belong to the Lord our God but those things which are revealed belong to us to our children forever the way we might do all the words of this vault okay so there's a great fountain in illis fountain of wisdom and revelation understanding knowledge and it's super waiting for us to tap into it okay it's always there price is almost there tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the tree of life are always traveling available you just tap into it we don't have to deceive knowledge in English into the tree of life the regular basis Matthew 6:6 the Zhou wen now press enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly Young Lions to lack and suffer hunger abated seek the Lord shall not want any good thing there's that say sign home or a fine car may that's cries what would be about any good thing what would that be to God eternal life right there's no good or say no better thing on the account no perspectives then the best thing to give you eternal life a more of a standing account is working so you're not walking look laughing good thing it'll be there he's always there ready you just tap into that and you'll not be you know like songs might rip it up shall not want write any good thing it will not put selfish things in that but that's not what not talking about Psalm 27 for one thing I have desired of the Lord that will I see after that I may dwell in the house little all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple 1.78 when now said sneak be my faith my heart said to me like race or philosophy this is the multi reading of second chapter of Philippians if there be therefore any consolation in prices any Concord of laws or any fellowship of the spirit minimality mercies completely my joy that ye may be like honors having the same love being of one for of blame I'm you know what is that one line come from you know the main I chose this connection to the gospel ministry while we have your popular ministry we succumb to one - right let's not nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves but not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this continue which left is act of the human will again this is your this is your part in what you do it's an active thing like the woman in a man when they're loving intimate to this children you know she has to be available she has to be willing to submit and surrender and so forth maintain the bride with pride the bridegroom we have to let be willing but we have to let part of our reward is a choice different attitudes isn't really your attitude towards the world my brother Cory was free fall back your attitude so important that if you take for God but it's mine being you but also listening prosecutors who may have for God but not Robert being worked on but made himself of no reputation that the by himself to form a circuit I was made of Alaska men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself in the penalty of conjugation death of the cross I told Gaby dozen years ago I said I use the phrase assume the position all right I don't mean that in the wrong way but like similar position you know pray in the humble position now on your knees every day prayer position green hair Bible all that every single day not into routine but just a book showing it showing off how sincere you are and whether you think you're getting now that or not the fact is you just keep going no matter what don't give you something it won't work if you see there a bit of that [Applause] okay this is mostly still way to take all the minor project entering into fellowship with him and on prayer coffees like our burning bush the school is all wrong ideas and thought to take on the money price okay so to speak we lose our mind spiritually speaking there because I think it was on my brain emphasis recruiting the Midland driving all those years five hours or something four hours every Sunday for twenty years or something pushes off your life if listen when he accepted the disease look at from a formal aspect in fact I thought she lost her mind well she found a much she found dry and i hanged out there to seek after what was precious to her she thanked him with such a high priority of her life that was served and over attitude for him for his cooking in a high priority she said what I've got to have and this is one fine piece and you know us when we def and I had heard on baby him on the hospital of death you know and our mind I really thought she was going to be dead when we left her and went to church here devala second in the next Sunday morning service I'll really touched me that we got that okay off today is lost trying but yet the fact is I lost my line so together we just total loss or mind we just want trying since all the money naturally lost your mind so retarders our mind spiritual take almond on Christ okay you three so how they things on the GAO content ditching all right but the letter killeth the spear given plot and in the presence of that burning bush you know more about dog problem mantises motive then he's been talking for years while whether it was an experience he just didn't have a letter to read or the law to read or the books to read he had an experience that dog still lived the God of Abraham what you just did locked in that day and that floor lamp as he was when he talks head man into one finitary why frosty 59 can afford even but one time in the presence of the anointing one time in the presence of the burning bush you know more about dogs than he learned in books in the eight years of his life dog trying to spend that a naught sent them is an experience takes them to the rigor training down through the sense of burning to punishment trying testing only 30 do that to his profit but it does it to its children every summer comes to God must be taking in driving it's advised were blind Bartimaeus is several 301 neither spoke saying go both Airy into a secret project and close the door and when you have did so right of your father who sees in secret and even safely reward the opening and when we're praying like that there seems to be something to the prayer that they call the hypocrisy out of it means like we get a better connection with God to get long up to my car this is mama bear claws I took my chicken truck I went down the road and just studying both wrote about hold his mouth out your little on drama or if you meditate if you think it on these thing but over there just studying after I knock to the highway where was prettier office some country roads allow it become so filled with His mercies and good until I've just stopped the car and helper will and wept like a little baby we've ever done that driving long distances you know the benefit of long drive and so I kept my driving job I've had three offers and the last two or three years to make a boss position well - were lost another anyway in all cases I would have a company car companies all pay cut less money they kind of anyway besides that I ordered it all this time there with God because there's my favorite thing that's the number one benefit of driving truck music still on gone nobody bother you out there myself walking out today and that's why it helps on top of that job for ten years that's what I did because there in the bank about the Lord it's a world level but they you all can find your own place you know why female driver 14 hour debate is still there it somewhere the believers position in crime 5501 on six to one we found some destruction come Dillon God revealed himself to him in the burning bush he found out then that the very thing that was then the burning bush was saying that he lacked and I think that whole of us today and many times we try to do the program ourselves and felt to get what was in the burning bush the direct revelation of the real and timeless God okay well the boss cream blush I'm talking about I thought about three men ferment then after she our godly men in our position I rank to name our heart with God and I'll count to discuss with you this idea of emulation so I think that's about where we'll talk about man so like we're in a free enterprise and discussing you not say free to start our own business you know so like somebody doesn't have the copyright or whatever the patent on the top the automobile thought until I started hopping to go build a car you know program free enterprise spiritually speaking on a free enterprise is for whosoever will offend another ball and found a way to grow closer to God and then put him in a position he's spent time and secret got a reward him openly because I can stand everything can talk to his revelation and perceived that he's got moved somewhere with God right slopping well how did he do that I'm talk to him before he has like a running our commute every day to work on the way home he arrives to drive his car to a bus station in Katonah Martin which is smarter and that even had translation it is going on party China man by doing the village planner and walks work well in that time he's thinking what can I do what was authentic servicing sermons you look closely studied and so that is burning bush one of the meaning towards others but and this is actually adopted photo at the film internet at skills report thank you Mike there's a green bush sorry a little and waffles I made this part more two years ago when you're going to just cutting grass yeah but I know now I could put a little mare car over here and then I'm like a bhop over here wherever he's at what are you doing homework preaching sermons what is that then all these planks the calls returning the little cottage promoting revelation and knowledge that they would be Lear mail and be free feed brother who does lips mouth not found this on the internet just a collage magazine I don't know that Rebecca's name girl motors plant I hope but plastic back in the arms ago there was a message like no old cars this was probably from under-17 level town there the time another day's work internal motor we've always heard him talk about what happened General Motors when he read six books Davis into two tapes so when income had long commute under the ball and there he would have comments on the job she did to be able to read and study and grow after they ate very much for a man who has grown into a big revelation hi positional Christ that's why we compete all people working so here you could say this is brother Dale work on a car and stopping to write notes for the fields and they look like you might even say it I won't thank you thing we're in their very nature it's not very much now alive what I do that brought out the farm I sit there and they load this is a crew of about twelve hours spent on certain house load the chickens in the pages this guy runs a small hydrostatic motors that pages on takes 30 minutes to load my trailer sometimes I'm in line behind pull out of the trucks Tom at the farm for three hours at a time some pounds in the truck great model great very much and what we do without this protocol for milling really [Laughter] God himself in convicted 303 170 morning God hide himself in a simple little watchfulness for ordinary man would consider hundreds arm and my Isaiah Dahman book is possible he stared Bible within two working sure it didn't wife in his drug guideline go out there may be hot himself and that man is something that harkens that our bishops was know nothing about so a little off moment your sisters was not works or whatever y'all do your day and you brothers whatever y'all do you don't have to be for I won't let me write them are just off you're working to our motors you find your own burning little cricket I found out that God will provide it if you're not a dog they help you find somewhere and do this so I want your business open 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. non-stop well so much really once you put it at the very least you can take on these things you meditate I know my redeemer 11 didn't get a flow six every true believer has that spot where God has met him there isn't one left out every believer has it every person that born of the camel dung knows that spot that meant that out where God took him and on those sacred sounds in the presence of the burning bush you did something to that belabor that all the mentality of the world can offer school here is for security no power he knew more about gardening five minutes after that then all the eighty years training has taught him and made a different man out of him it'll make a difference and one out of you those women listen to you don't have to be a master is nothing you don't have to be Amanda study all this is not all away people if you just stand still long enough two years force as a thought on our way that's how alone is very really profound good you know distant alternate sighs no the other side see what this thing see wasn't it same dog has done I trust that God will bring that burning bush and the hearing distance of every person has a nightly confess car away okay I hope that's my less luck well now we got one more so thank on your way three years ago I brought this scripture out and help anybody caught it but get out of 15 will show me this little orange over there still count in this scripture pollutants for the bill folks did and calmly Spain in a very some there are eight things one two three four which means returning right okay this is your Christian journey no matter who you are you have to receive the truth before anything really didn't work god yes into the truth whatever things are true but it made your tulips are things are honest the truth is what probably realized you're a sinner personally right cause you'd be honest with yourself come to reality where you are you begin to awaken spiritually but certain things are just pure loving this station sanctification that mean the Holy Spirit okay because you didn't see the truth you would know about where you are look realize you meet it for penance and sanctification is that the most spiritual love of God goddess love said about in our heart what certain things are good or for the accuser of the Brethren the devil he runs out of thing to say he said no Lord I say about running you want to the pontiff let me know there's often some come up with them your angel can go fooled on now he can begin to say all these looking just like every next my dues okay good report that puts you let's say right this case might get much more realistic what sort of things are good report if there be any virtue now you put a Pharma statutory purpose man and then if they're being afraid the heads no you know coming to process that hearing you become so one where it's worse than spirit and traitors you're absolutely going to try make or anything so when you're alone if you can't seem to get the wheels turning you can't seem to think about whether or what can i what can I do how can I start this going just start thinking about think about where he stood Emily for the first time you fell toward the prison my grandma when I was three or four years old was reading the Bible to the in fragment okay I think all of that - that 12 years old I began to realize I was a sinner I needed topic and I started thinking about that that caused me to be honest then I came on into justification and so forth or on tournament just keep thinking on where God brought you from where it brought you to where you're going and think about the revelation no thing is all red revealty just thinking all those things over stop think that's my lesson any questions though comment just Gabby volition in the holes it will be okay mom the other chicken are we are totally off anybody next question
