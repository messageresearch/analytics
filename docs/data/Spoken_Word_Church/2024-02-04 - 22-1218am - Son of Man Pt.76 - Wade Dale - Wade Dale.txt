leave him alone Satan you're defeated you might come among us but you can't stay here you are a defeated creature and in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray that each one of you that's been sick we good to see sister Anna back again with us she's been sick Lord and I pray the ones that are sick at home Lord that we have not mentioned sister Freda in different ones that are not here today that you would Minister to them Father as the word Goes Forth father just grant us Lord Grace and Lord bring us to Perfection bring us to Virtue knowledge Temperance all the way up the statue of perfect man Lord because without you we can't do anything just bless each one father in Jesus name amen we've been on this for 76 times but I still I love reading the word of God and I love reading right there in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and what truth Luke 6: 19 says the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue and that's what we're going to talk about today in this afternoon bring another couple of points in that we were uh thinking on this week and what virtue went out of him and healed them all Revelation 6 verse1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it were the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer you may be seated in the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word it is uh good to see sister Anna back with us uh she been out sick and thank God like Brother Anderson said it didn't get through the whole family the kids stayed good and everything's all right so we good with that all right so now what we been talking about we've been talking about truth and we've been talking about also bringing in something that um that we all need to have in that strength we need to have power we need to have virtue we need to have power over the devil all right and we've been talking about the different things about truth and we're going to read here in brother brother Bri in Le see in church age we've read it before we read it many many times brother Dale read this he just kept reading it and reading it when we were going through Revelations and different ones brother Brown says now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 now you see there was two things that he came to do all right he came to do what restore the restore the faith of the fathers from the beginning we'll talk about that a little bit more and then according to Revelations 10:7 break the seals or the seals come open which is The Headstone which is which is what the ministry of Jesus Christ just like it was 2,000 years ago the truth not a truth but the truth everybody with me so number one he'll what according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children that's what see brother randam can't change your heart God has to change your heart but he changed it through a message through a Ministry he changed our heart back to the thinking of the faith of the fathers that back to where Peter and Paul and the different ones Peter says look on us and Paul says hey you know uh you followed me long enough devil get out of that woman and leave me alone or get out of that man and leave me alone all the different things because remember virtue is power virtue is not being a virgin we're going to talk about that this afternoon uh a couple of points I want you to realize one thing and I want you to think about this you look through the Bible and you look through some of the women some of the great women they talk about the great women of the Bible uh the rhabs the uh you got even even the woman at the well even you've got Ruth you Esther listen some of them weren't virgins some of them were I'm raise your head up some of them were prostitutes but they're in the lineage of of Jesus Christ they're Gentiles just like me and you and I'm going to read you a quote that I just found back there a few minutes ago that shocked me brother randam said and I'll read it this afternoon Rahab is a type of the believer now how in the world can you can you place that without being a prophet and knowing what he's talking about cuz you and I were all prostitutes before we came to God I don't care if you were white lily virgin in your body you were a prostitute in your soul that's right sorry about that but remember she became a Believer and God spared her life you became a Believer and God spared your life amen so thank God for Grace So number two he'll reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders don't let that don't let that bother you we're going to get into that later on in Revelations 10 which what the revelations contained in the seals so when he opened the seals the Thunders broke so we don't have to wait for some Thunder to clap or or seven men or ever how whatever they were you know a long time ago they thought it had to be seven men with their voice no that's not what it was it's the voice of God speaking to you yes I I you know I love brother Dy but if if the Lord speaks to him that's God speaking to him then God's got to speak to me in my way so that I can understand him all right brother Dy may catch it like that may take me six months amen all right so two he'll reveal those Mysteries it'll be those revealed look mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers now that those mystery truths are not water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus that was the faith of the fathers they taught Jesus Christ's water baptism they taught no eternal hell so that's these mystery truths he's talking about here are not that part of you say why it's a yeah it's a mystery that was held down through the church ages of water baptism and trinitarian Doctrine but the first part of Malachi four is what took care of that when you come into the message of the hour when you got born again and we were talking about years you know about a year ago um when you come in you have to get born again well when you get born again it's not born again in the message no you're not a message Baby You're a Jesus Christ baby you're born again of the spirit of God and what does he lead you he leads you and guides you into all truth so he leads you into the Bible and then that will lead you to truth if it's a true New Birth yes so it'll have to be the message of the hour the first time you hear it you may question it but you get the new birth and you continue on then it's going to have to be that these truth from the part number one which is water baptism which is no eternal hell which is all the different things that brother Bown brought in the early part of his ministry but these mystery truths are something that we're going to have to talk about in the seals and all the different things that we're going to talk about try to weave it in a little bit because everybody everybody thought the first seal was white horse rider was the Holy Ghost even brother Ram taught it until God opened these mystery truths to him to literally turn us back to the faith of the fathers in other words change our body all right listen having all these virtues in your life will not change your body it will get you on the road to change your body but it will not change your body your body change will have to come from that headstone the son of man message and we'll get it to it in a little while and bring the pools in because the third pull is to what a special group of people we'll talk about that in just a minute how's that going to fit in with this I'll show you in just a second just hang loose John 17:17 says sanctify them how are we going to get Sanctified by the truth brother R says Rahab was Sanctified by what believing the truth she said without even see it said she never saw listen to this she never saw um Joshua but she believed that God was with them in other words she told them we have been shaking in our boots since you crossed Jordan cuz somebody saw that great big Mighty Jordan open up yes sir and all you came walking across playing tambourine shouting and having a Pentecostal time y'all weren't scared but we are even Behind These great big walls that we built up we were scared but it Sanctified them when she took and put that Scarlet rope that's what saved them right oh yeah that's what Sanctified them red blood Sanctified them and Joshua said hey if you see that red cord do not destroy that house amen that's the same way with me and you as somebody was saying the other day you know you as brother Ryan was talking about you going through life and you just you know happy gol lucky and care of the world and everything blah blah blah blah blah that thing was over it was around there it was waiting on you to come to a place oh yeah to where you stop like Rahab stopped and said hey I believe what's coming we're getting we're going to be destroyed yes you know what I want you and every one of us to do this year I want you to be destroyed I was destroyed at this altar several years ago amen the wrath of God was poured out on my soul yes sir everybody's going to come to the wrath of God you're either going to come to it here or you going to come to it over there that's right so I want to take it here yes I want to be sprinkled and covered by his blood I don't want him to be sprinkled with my blood let his blood be on us and our children you see how that got them people they got the blood of Jesus on them and they got what destroyed all right I want to have I want to have his blood on me once once I come to a destruction that's why it's got to come to a new birth it's got to come to a death yes destroy me destroy me Lord oh no I want to be blessed and yeah I want to be blessed too but you got to destroy that old man first sanctify them through what thy truth Thy word is the truth as thou has sent me into the world even so I have sent them into the world you we've got to go into the world Listen Rahab was in the world she went to the world brother Brown said and I'll read it this afternoon she got caught in a trap in other words her her parents maybe didn't have any money she had to go on the street and do what she was doing she was trapped weren't you and I trapped into it hello somebody that's what brother Ram said we were trapped into it we were trapped into this by our adulterous parent Eve and Adam but what happened was we found sanctification in the word of God where he can so sanctify you that even Rahab had a baby named Boaz right and Boaz is a type of Christ coming through a gentile prostitute come on somebody yeah we're we preach Purity we preach but we preach Grace too if you don't see grace I told somebody we talking about the other day I'll promise you one thing if you can't extend Grace to somebody Grace has not been extended to you yet if you can't extend Grace to somebody it has not been extended to you yet because you can't understand Grace you understand law do this don't do that do this don't do that and for their sake I sanctify myself what did he he Sanctified himself Jesus Christ did said look I'm not going to have that I'm not going to have a wife I'm not going to have family I'm not going to have this I'm going to have a bride by spiritual union not by natural Union by spiritual union look that way Satan can have nothing to do with it yes sir he can't defile this body because it's a spiritual body he can defile this body but he can't defile the one that's inside of Us Praise the Lord also might be Sanctified together you and I might be Sanctified what through the truth that's why the prophet of God had to bring us truth back had to restore truth so that we could even get started right everybody with me am all right look now we're talking about the three different levels of man we got the outside which you see right now see which is C taste fi smelling here then you've got an inside gu which is the spirit that's what we've been talking about the past several months is those five senses memory reason conscious affection imagination that's that middle realm that Spirit realm that Satan can can get a shot he's got a shot at but so does God God got a shot you know what that one in the middle that control man is one Faith or doubt today you're either Faith or your doubt one of the two all right you're either born again you're either white or black inside your soul today you're not gray amen there's no gray area with God Amen you're either born again and have give your life and and let the wrath of God birth you are you're looking at the wrath of God if you don't get born again I'm just Bible I'm sorry if it hurts your feelings but it's a truth I'm telling you we got to come to a place I listened to a brother the other day and he's right these smiling Joel old steam preachers that Don't Preach against sin everybody's going to heaven you know we going to have prostitutes in heaven and we going to have all these different you know everything's we're all going to heaven no we're not God is a jealous God God is an angry God when you turn him down cuzz he's going to give you 120 years in Noah's time to 120 years to repent and then not one person got saved except his household so the Inside Man is a spirit man which is controlled by five censes memory reion consci faction imagination and then inside of you is what inside of that spirit is a soul and it's controlled by one thing free will all right Free Will free moral agency everybody so you can't tell me as brother Ryan was covering today you know and it's hard to preach this cuz you you look at this you say well I always was eternal yes you were in the mind of God but I'm going to read you a quote where brother Brown said you come to this world lost now what does that mean to you lost lost means lost it don't mean you got a little speck a something in you somewhere no way God won't dwell in an unclean vessel the things I did when I was a sinner God was nowhere to be found step in his mind he said I know buddy I'm going to get you in 1997 I'm going to knock you off your feet and when I knock you off your feet I see and have this ready for you that you're going to hear me and you're going to respond to me that's the to me that's Redemption to me that if it wasn't then it just be that God pulled you through a tube and said well I know you always had eternal life in your soul so I'm just going to pull you through this too no you were lost why would you need a free will if you had God in your soul when you were born that's right please you do away with Jesus you do away with what what the whole Plan of Redemption but the people in the message use it as something that makes us better than anybody else cuz we came with this special something in us no we were special in the mind of God and then when we got born again and we got that old man died that old man got killed amen we became what not just children of God we became God we became part of his soul soul to soul but now we're working on the second realm or the memory reason conscious affs in the imagination now watch that determines what spirit is in there if it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God and it won't feed on anything of the world the prophet of God says now look now inside of that Spirit which you become when you're born in the earth and the breath of life it breathe into you look that spirit is of a worldly nature now is God a worldly nature anything of God a worldly nature I'm just reading you a quote the spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from God it was permitted by God Amen that's why all babies go to heaven cuz he know you don't can't come to that free will place and he can give you eternal life but you're not bride no way nope only the redeemed that comes to full Redemption is considered bride yes there'll be Eternal yes there'll be in in the uh in the world to come but they will not be bride everybody with me now you got that for every child that's born in the world is born in what sin shapen in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that sounds really good but that's where we all were now look right here so that person inside there is a center to begin with inside where inside your soul where does unclean Spirit gets driven out of your soul and God won't dwell in an unclean vessel you can't have God and Satan in the same place right NOP that's that old two soulold Doctrine they just wrapped it up in new new Christmas wrapping paper and fed it to the people of the CH of the message sorry about that but it does there's five outlets in the spirit and you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental faculty at all your body doesn't so you have to think with your spirit that's why I said all along don't worry about this guy well it's just my flesh's fault no it's not your flesh's fault no your flesh got here because your Mom and Daddy got together permitted by God got together and produced your body and then God put a soul inside of you for you to make a choice all right so it's a choice you make all right but your body don't think you don't think with your body you only react I'm only reacting to what I know that I'm doing my hands like this they're not uncontrollable that's right we're all controlled by something right like I said before it didn't bother me to go open up a um um go to the convenience store and open the thing up with this same hand grab a case of beer out go drink it didn't bother me a bit oh it bothered you oh well just pray for me because I'm one of these people that was a sinner okay darn said me too so I was what thinking with my spirit and what did my hand do my hand did what my spirit told it to do but now that I have the spirit of God in that same place now this hand opens the Bible and hopefully it is teaching and preaching the word of God and God didn't have to destroy this he just changed it amen so he didn't destroy it he changed it he destroyed your own nature and then works from the inside out Satan work from the outside in that's the Battle Ground the greatest battle ever foughts in your mind yes sir but you don't think with your mind you think with your heart everybody with me so you have to think with your spirit you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being reason doesn't see taste feel smelling hair reason is what you can make in your mind if you're asleep or you're out your body is lying there dead but your spirit can still reason there's five senses that control that inside man that's the the not the center but the outside realm now to the last man which is the soul there's only one sense as I said before today you're either lost or saved one of the two now you may be in the process all right you may be in the process of going through justification sanctification but sanctification does not put you in the body that's right amen it cleans you up and sets you aside for service doesn't put you in service the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what puts you in service then you have to take that Holy Ghost though then you got to fight you got to fight that memory reason conscious effects imagination cuz you know what Satan wants you to remember everything you did bad oh I'm sorry am I the only one again oh okay but you got a free moral agency to choose or reject well I didn't have a I had this I had this eternal life in me and and I didn't make a choice yeah you did make a choice you made a choice and God knew your choice therefore he had it waiting for you when you got here remember the prophet of God said he sends down your representation the woman at the well had representation from what predestination not from her mom and daddy not from the situation she was in because you know what what that got saved sorry to say it like that but that got saved brother R said she did got eternal life that's us yes we're not Lily white I'll promise you that not in our soul some people touch the Garment of Jesus was made well others smacked him in the face and hit him on the head so in other words there here is two attitudes that comes to brother that comes to brother Jesus that comes to Jesus and you got Jesus being touched and the lady was healed and you got these Roman soldiers that was beating him over head and saying hey tell us who hit you put a put a rope put a thing around his face it's the attitude that you come in I'm going get down to the bottom cuz this is what I was this is something I want to insert right here it was obeying what God Said do now that's what these verses are it's obeying what God Said do all right what brought the power we all need to be brought to that power which is called virtue because remember power is virtue not living a virgin Life we'll get to that this afternoon what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God all right so the word of God as we've been talking about many times and we've all been covering about you know doing the right thing and coming to church and having an attitude that you want to come not that you got to come all right and I want to add something in there too if you don't mind coming to church doesn't mean just getting here 3 minutes before the service starts boy now you quiet some of y'all come wobbling in right when I come in that's not right that's not coming to church y'all sit out in the car and talk on the phone until you I get ready to preach then you come in here and show yourself no God sees more than that you need to be here praying you know why cuz you going to bring some spirit inside with you if you don't get it out of here between there and you sitting down ain't going to be no sitting downstairs either you say oh I'm tired well if you're sick you can sit downstairs if you're just going to sit down there cuz you don't like sitting up here you can go home cuz you don't want to be here anyway cuz you know what you walk through those doors there a spirit on you that spirit's going to get exposed inside this building and it don't want to get exposed so it stays out there because I want you to look right here this is Samuel a prophet let me set the stage here this is Samuel that was just a little something we need to we need to sharpen our pencils we need to sharpen our pencils get here brother Brown said 20 minutes before the service starts and do what pray read your Bible not come hurrying in here two minutes before you're hindering the service yeah you are it's enough hindrance without all that okay so let's just try to get here and be a servant of God and a child of God and get to church on time you sure won't miss a doctor's appointment I promise you that you'll be there 15 minutes before the appointment just to make sure you don't miss it for them to tell you you're sick we're trying to give you the gospel to tell you you can get healed from that yeah come on here we go that's and it's our mental thinking it's our thinking thinking you know I mean really you going to arrest to the doctor for him to tell you you got something wrong with you and then not come in here and say God I want to get rid of all that and you know what we don't charge a dime you pay your ties to Jesus Christ you don't pay it to the church okay and you'll go pay him $500 in the doctor's office to tell you sick well I'm going to tell you for free you're well if you'll come here and do what God tells you today amen cuz look watch this you say well I'm a believer I'm this I'm that watch this right here here is Samuel now what did Samuel tell Saul Samuel is what Samuel is a prophet he's the prophet of the day come on he's the prophet of the day all right and Saul is the King of the day that the people elected not God so Samuel says Saul you got to go to these two kings can't remember their name but you got to go to these two kings kill them all go kill them all Saul says yeah I'll do it no problem well you know he doesn't but you know what Saul's excuse was Saul said well I brought these two kings in maybe we can convert them oh well I'm going to save some of these sheep and and and goats for sacrifice Lord Prophet no he didn't do what the prophet told him to do and you know what that you know what happened to Saul God took the kingdom away from him right there for not doing what the prophet said and Samuel said ha the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrific this is after Saul said hey I got all these animals go Samuel walks in and he goes he looks back in the room there's two kings sitting back there in the prison and he comes in a little bit further and he hears the blading of sheep and and he hears the animals and he said what is this I hear Saul Saul said oh but like I said but we got some burnt offerings here now we just going to offer it to the Lord and we got these two kings back here and we're going to we're going to convert them you going to see what happened to them in just a second by a prophet not by a general by a prophet he took Saul's sword and cut their head off and Samuel said ha the Lord is great Delight in burnt offering and sacrifice as an obeying the voice of the Lord question mark behold to obey what I read down here obedience to the word of God behold to obey is better than sacrifice I'm in the message I believe the I believe this I Lord I I know you know a little bit of this and a little bit of that come on that doesn't mean that much no I'm like what brother Dale said he worried many times about why God told Israel to kill them even kill the babies this is our loving God he said take every one of those amalekites and kill them babies and all but you know what he was doing in our eyes it was a Slaughter in God's eyes was I'm going to save all them babies I can't do anything about these old people but I can save them babies and I can you know what if they would have done away with all the amalekites the amalekites would have never bothered Israel again but since he let some of them go they bothered them the whole time it was like a brother BR said a hering a biscuit they just followed him along and it was trouble all the time what I'm telling about me and you we need to chop off all that stuff all that stuff needs to die don't divorce didn't just say well I'll be good on Sunday and not on Monday behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken listen to God than the fat of Rams for Rebellion that's what you are that's what I am and you are if we don't do what God says we rebel against his word I the wrong craft you're rebellious if you don't do what God said you're Rebel you're a rebel you're rebellious and you're not rebellious to me brother Dale another Ministry you're rebellious to God and brother brand we all we believe brother Brown was a prophet but I don't believe we need to be here 20 minutes before service starts well you're a rebel and you're what for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft in other words you're formulating your own idea you've got your old cauldron and you just you just put what in it you want to and you just Stir It Up that's Witchcraft and look and stubbornness is as iniquity and and idolatry H boy that hurt all of us didn't it stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou Hast rejected what the word of the Lord he has also rejected thee from being King Saul continued to be king but God never recognized it anymore he raised up David David's the King this is not the king this guy can't do what I said but even though David was a murderer David was a li David was an adulterer God still said he's a man after my own heart he did not say that Saul was even though s Saul said I think we'll save a few of these and we'll sacrifice them and and we'll try to convert them to men no Saul said I mean Samuel said no give me a sword I think the Bible says he went and pulled the sword so he went Samuel this old Prophet yeah thank God he sent us a prophet with a sword in his hand and he went over there and he put his foot on one of them's neck and he took that one's head off put his foot on the other one's neck and took that one's head off and he handed that sword back to Saul and says you better do what God Said do from now on and walked out the door well if we'd had somebody do like that we'd be all upset about it but that's the word of God Amen Let The Sword of the word correct all the error brother Bram said look we're not building an organization I'm not here this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build an organization he sent me to build what individuals I know for a fact this whole world is not going to get saved that's amen I know this whole world is not going to accept this message of the hour amen and I know there's a lot of people that's around the message that ain't going to make it either but individuals individual individ idual individuals some may be right here somebody somebody may be want waiting on me to go to knowledge or want me to head on up to guid this cuz that's where you're at but just be patient cuz what we're going to pull everybody up that we can that's what we're going to talk about in just a minute why did Brother BR bring a three pulls pull not push we'll read it in just a second we'll get to it everybody all right say Amen Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they may be not that he they may be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word yes by his word see build up the individual to that place not build an organization to a greater denomination but build the individual to Sons and Daughters of God that's the idea add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge now you're coming to a place so let's talk about virtue just for a minute now we know we looked at the definition we're going to look at it again for the sake of the ones who weren't here um good to see brother John's mom back there with us and sister Rebecca's Mama too sorry but she got her kids here today good to see you mom she plays that tambourine love that Luke 6 verse 19 says and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and healed them all in other words it was strength to that came out of Jesus they knew they knew his background this woman at the that had a blood issue she what she had to know his background cuz she said if I can only Touch the Hem of His Garment I'll be made well if I can only touch him touch the Garment not him so he came up behind she came up behind him and touched the board of His Garment immediately her issue of blood stamps Jesus said who touched me when they all denied it Peter said wait a minute Lord everybody's touching you he said but Peter somebody's touched me special than what you're tou probably Peter had him by the by the arm and said Lord well that wasn't any virtue going out of that but that woman needed something Jesus said somebody have touched me for I perceive that virtue or strength is gone out of me and then when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling falling down before him and we know what happened said daughter be of good Comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace praise the Lord can we do that today can we touch the him of His Garment today and say God I got a need I don't have to see you I don't even have to hear you I just got to believe you I just got to believe what you've already said not what's coming up but what you already said all right and that word Virtue we know is the same thing as when he said power will be given to you from on high right before he ascended and came back on the day of Pentecost is that right which is dunamus which is what it's where we get the word Dynamite brother Bernie villain W wore this night wore this word out for years and years when he come here he loved that word dunamus which is power Mighty work strength strength power and ability inherent power power residing in a thing it's got to be in you before you can give it out all right you got to have money in the bank before you write the check some have tried it doesn't work all right let's go let's keep on going now here's what we do what's the first thing have faith and be born again that's laying the foundation and we've been staying on faith for a long time listen you got to believe this is the right message you've got to believe that I can't make you believe I can preach from now to Noah 120 years it's going to rain next service it's going to rain Wednesday night it's going to rain Sunday it's going to rain Sunday afternoon it's going to rain 120 years Michael he preached that they don't tell them how many he had brother M had 1100 sermons in like 30 years he probably had 6 or 7,000 sermons and it all was on one thing it's going to rain did it save anybody NOP eight people that's all that art is going to hold anyway of course God knew that right okay everybody with me so you got to believe you got to take it into your heart and say look I believe not what I'm saying you believe what God's saying through me amen all right take out all the other stuff stuff and just say look count that to my ignorance but if I tell you what the word of God says directly from the word of God you're not fighting me you're fighting God Amen you're not fighting brother Dale you hadn't fought brother Dale all these years you've been fighting God all right that's what I believe amen that's what I believe all right you got to believe the same thing brother Ryan was talking about all the what the word Lula meant that was pretty neat I like that but listen it's not a place we can be just as lost as a blind dog in The Meat House they always say but if you're born again you're going to get something from God and God's obligated to get you to the right place he's obligated to what his word his word said I'll lead you and guide you into that was weak all truth all right not just some first you have faith then you had virtue to your faith this is the next column pour your foundation Faith then your faith at virtue now right there knocks a lot of us down yes sir add virtue to your faith that doesn't just mean living a virgin life that's what we're going to cover this afternoon CU it is truly the word Virtue does connect to a virgin life and listen sisters if you were a virgin before you married if you're still a virgin now before you you met somebody you have power that 90% of this world has no idea what kind of power you hold that's right now some of us sisters come on now sisters and brothers that have got married and you're not a virgin anymore we know that's for a fact you hold a power inside of you sisters that brother Brown said you hold a virtue in you that no man can do anything with you're the only one that can control it you're the one that can say yes and I know we beat on the women all the time but you know what there's some there's some guys that needs to be virgins too you know okay we may have to talk about about later on but not today all right cuz listen when we get to the when we get past the stat perfect man when we get into The Headstone you going to have to cover marriage and divorce you got to cover some of those things that to keep yourself pure now that don't mean like I said before that don't mean well I'm a virgin I'm going to heaven no that don't mean that cuz God's got to transform you into a virgin in your soul not in your body there's no way you can reverse that Catholic church has tried to do it they try to reverse it and say that you're a virgin now and nothing ain't going to happen like the old saying once saved always saved well no a no if you're a virgin today count yourself one of the strongest women on the face of this Earth sister says amen that's brother says Amen to keep yourself is a strength that this world does not know about cuz they want you to be a pervert from the time you're six or seven years old I hate to to say that but it's a truth but that's not going to take you to heaven no but it will help you absolutely to live a virgin life but you and I are supposed to be living a virgin life ourself men and women cuz I'm going to read you a quote here either today or tonight where brother Brown calls us The Virtuous sinless PR of Jesus Christ how do we get there how' we get to that well we did some way we're we're trying to get to it now by what faith virtue knowledge Temperance but it doesn't mean a virgin life you know like the woman or a man or so forth that doesn't have nothing to do with that all right it has nothing to do with that virtue right there brother Dell covered this many years ago about the meanings of these words in a worldly Manner and the meanings in what brother randam gave us and they're totally different because this is from God and this is from man if you say have add to your faith virtue 90% of the people in the world are going to say be a virgin not be held by a man not be held by a woman all right but see there's a lot of things that we that we're not going to cover but I'll just give you a little a little snippet brother brandham says two things that really stands out in my heart he says you know he said kissing was potential adultery wow and the sex glands are in your lips if you ever kissed your wife you don't know that sorry but if you hadn't then you wait to your husband and wife you her husband and wife don't play around and think you can get by with it cuz your it's a connection they're not your sex glands but it's a connection to we'll get to that later on but we need to live clean we need to try our best to live as clean as we can all right I know this world just absolutely I mean you look over here and you see a naked woman and to get away from her you look over here and you see one worse so I mean you're just bouncing all back and forth but you just say God you know what I save their soul if you'll save their soul we don't have to worry about that the Bible said virtue went out of him that's right congregation says amen if we're going to be like him we must have virtue then we must have it to be like him first song I ever loved to him was to be like Jesus well I'm going I'm if I'm going to be like Jesus I've got to have virtue and pass that it can pass forward from me to the people because virtue went out of him to the people virtue and before you can let it out you got to have it first amen you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out of what if someone tried to draw virtue out of us and the check would return insufficient funds see no no none there to draw from check bounced somebody looking at you as a Christian and tomorrow see you out here carrying on like a c there's not much virtue can be drawn from that see right virtue must be in US yes and until we get virtue then when we get true virtue we can add it to our faith that's the next foundation wall first you must have the faith now this and I read you this quote a long time ago prophet of God said faith alone won't do it faith alone won't do it you can stay a Christian you can be a Christian but you're just going to be defeated all the time I'm sorry you're just going to be defeated all the time if you don't grow into some of these virtues I'm sorry amen this is the way God said it up not me I just thank God that he sent us a prophet that could give us the ABCs and how to do this all right how to approach God I believe brother Rand I don't care if they call him whatever they want to call him he he gave me the ability to approach God in a way that's the truth right did he you he brought Clarity to me he didn't he didn't bring well I just believe brother Brown was the prophet I just believe no you got to have faith and you got to believe that God sent him and that second part of that was what to reveal to me the mystery truths to get me out of here not just make me a good Christian brother Brown from 47 to 63 that's what he was doing he was hammering be a good Christian get better get back to the word of God get back get these virtues working in your life cuz when did he preach this remember he preach thatat you of perfect man when get to it in just a second 1962 this is before the seals broke so in other words you got to have these virtues before you the seals break if brother brandham needed these virtues before that then you and I obviously going to have to have the same thing that's why they're so important but why they're so ill taught you don't hear many people preaching on them you know why cuz they can't live it and they don't think it's important I had one preacher say one time that well that's not very important I thought okay well just throw the throw the throw the book of Peter out second whatever it is second Peter one we going to start throwing things out if that's not important let's throw this out that's not important let's throw that out I thought we supposed to I thought we supposed to be living what is already in there not trying to throw stuff out or or skip over and read something different virtue anyone knows that the word virtue means see and it must have you must have it we if virtue went out of him to heal the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church same virtue in his church because he was our example and if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us to have virtue to give to the people and what is virtue virtue is strength or power I want you to read we read this quote the other day but I want you to read it in that big bowl letters down there brother R said we got to have virtue we got to have virtue we got to have virtue and after you have virtue you must after you have faith you must have virtue have virtue for the whole world Wow have virtue for the whole world do you know the only thing holding this world together is me and you the wrath of God is about that far above us when we leave this place Katie bar the door if you're not from the south you won't understand what I just said but it's an old saying that uh Katie you better the door cuz here comes the calvary all right then he talks about preaching a sermon we'll get to this right here and then we'll stop about 20 years ago on Reverend Mr Lily Lily the pastor took it from a text where Jesus said consider the Lily have they neither tall or spin yet I say to you Solomon in all his glory is not AR raay like one look at the Lily comes from way down in the muck we come from way down in the mck and every minute of the day it has to be drawing from the earth see what does it do with this virtue that it draws it gives it out it makes a beautiful sight for the admirer it opens itself for honey for the bee to come and get his part don't complain it's just got it to give out wow what if the bee come in there insufficient funds as we laughing we being beekeepers we about you know we see flowers out in the in the yard and the garden and stuff and the bees are just going at it well some of these flowers that we put on graves are plastic and we're you know thinking like a bee we're going to fly to this thing and it's open it looks like it's got pollen on it we go this ain't soft this ain't got no pollen in it that's what he's saying there was no pollen to get insufficient funs what fake right fake that little bee would scratch his head and say what kind of Lily is that or what kind of flower is that never have they ever made honey out of a plastic flow hello somebody I'm talking about us a put on a show that your perfect man brother Brown said I say I said then the first thing you know that somebody loves to smell the odor he's continue on this story he ain't selfish he's got odor all those plants that we see that the bees go to they don't open up and say oh here comes the bee no they open up and they just keep making they just keep making pollen keep making pollen and the bee just keeps taking it keeps making honey and a lot of y'all are enjoying that he's got odor before he can give out odor he has to have it before he can give out honey he has to have it before he can give out Beauty he has to have it before you can give out virtue you have to have it so add to your faith virtue amen understand now watch what he said he just stopped right here everybody wake up just for a minute get off your phones or whatever you're doing back there you can't look at me and looking down the floor before you can give out virtue you have to have it touch not physical see he reverts back to the woman that that touched His Garment she didn't touch him physically that's right but she pulled out of him what she needed right pulled she pulled out so let's look and see what the word pull means just for a second we'll close here in just a second the word pull to exert Force upon so as to cause or tend to cause motion toward the force boy think spiritual with me please for just a few minutes that is so profound God is pulling us to his power God is pulling us to his word he's pulling calling us to have virtue watch to draw apart to Rend or to tear to perform or carry carry out now this is one I want to look at right here to draw the support or attention of to attract brother Bram what is the attraction on the mountain what are you looking for what are you looking at are you looking just to sit here and die get a gold star for being a message believer for 50 years you want a pen No I want to get out of here here I don't want to get old they're already ain't pretty but to attract what have you been attracted to the whole time you've been in this message have you just been attracted and got Blinded By the Light of William brandom put it all on him I hope not cuz watch this just real quick and then we'll close right here this is my thought he's talking about pulling it out of it now remember what were the Third third P the three PS for those of you that are new I think everybody here's Believers so they know what I say when I mean third pull brother R was given a vision and he was told the different pulls which a pull you pull he's pulling something have you ever tried to push a rope it will not go where you want it to go but if you pull it it will you pull that rope it'll come right here you try to push that rope into that hole it'll go like this and that's just the way me and you are if we decide we're going to push this thing pull number one was what the sign in the hand he take people's hand and you see the bumps and then when the bumps would go away you were healed he' pronounced you heal all right the second one was discernment and I wrote myself a note to remember to talk about this but what did discernment do it pulled out what was in your heart is that that right woman comes up to the platform he says woman I don't know you you look like a fine woman maybe he was say your spirit is welcome so you must be a Christian what's he doing he's pulling out information he FS the pull from her cuz sometimes he didn't he said hey you need to get saved not too long ago I was one there was a brother come up to there and he said brother Brown said oh I see you want to be saved he said you need to quit smoking first that man probably went how didn't know that no he did I mean he didn't say it that bold said hey I see that you're here and I see you're looking for for salvation he said but you smoke cigarettes he said you need to quit them he said you need to pray to get that smoking demon off of you so he just went ahead and prayed for him but look so all that discernment was what he pulled out what was inside those people and they pulled from him because he said it's not me he said the angel standing between me and you right now or he's no more than two feet away that Pillar of Fire that discernment pulled out what was inside of him and what was inside of the people so to me that's what we're under you say no we're third pole people listen third poll is the opening of The Seven Seals it's the opening of the mystery truths we haven't got to that yet now I say we I say in preaching you may be sitting there with it but I I'm talking about preaching we're in this discernment part cuz that's what's pulling these out to have Godly knowledge you got to be able to show it to have Godly virtue you got to be able to show it to have Godly Temperance you got to be able to show it so it's the second under the second pull which is discernment what's Discerning you today I'm not the word of God's Discerning you yes right the word of God is what's doing the Discerning I mean it's like brother Dale said you don't have have much discernment when people people look at you kind of angry and then they look down they look away they can't look you in the face but what's it doing you've come under listen you've come under the anointing of the Holy Ghost you've come under the anointing of God himself not a second person or a third person you not come under the anointing of the message of the hour either well that made you quiet you come under the anointing of the Holy Ghost which is going to lead you to the message of the hour and give you all truth yes but we're under the discernment stage now we're going to you're going what did I tell you what I tell you beginning of the year let it out listen you either going to let it out or God's going to pull it out one of the two so we come under the second pull which was what discernment and then the third pull was what something he said no one can imitate this remember they imitated the first one they imitated the second one he said carnal impersonations everywhere he said but that third pull was what that was the opening of those seals that's where no man had ever been before that's when the son of man Ministry began in brother Brown's life believe it if you want to if you don't say Amen that means you don't believe in against daddy does cuz he's been preaching he's back there saying amen now we talked about Jesus for a minute I'm going to get to something right here and then we'll close musicians Come on talk about Peter and John they came to the gate beautiful and what was going on in their life is they were taught by the word of God they were taught all those years by the word of God you going to play the Manon aren't you good job thank you it's good that you bow and let him do that you come up here and play something else there nothing else to play okay brother Ryan you can you play the bass not yet you've been practicing had you now it's a good time to practice what you laughing about you go play the but look the reason the disciples had the virtues working in her life they were with the virtue himself and they walked with him and brother John they didn't understand him they probably looked that like some people look at you and go what's he talking about cuz always they're going what he talking about he talks to us in Parables what's going on here but I promise you when that Holy Ghost because remember God said Jesus said hold on a minute you may not understand who I am but if you wait go to Jerusalem and wait till you endued with power from on high dunamus you're going to understand what I've been telling you and then what you're going to do you're going to be the one that's going to preach it to the other people cuz out of that one man came 120 little jesuses and those 120 little jesuses bir 3,000 on the day of Pentecost and there's no telling where they went that the disciples went all over the world what preaching him yes preaching Jesus Christ that's right that's what we need to get to preach Jesus Christ first cuz Peter looked at him fast his eyes on him and said look on us wasn't in a prayer line didn't have to go pray up didn't have to call the pastor look at us Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I to thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk amen let's stand rise up and walk and took him by the hand and guess what immediately his feet and ankles receed what strength that where that strength come from Peter and John The Virtue that they had they let it out and here it come and it hit that man right where he needed it hit that sister right where she needed it it hit all those brothers and sisters all the ones in the prayer line that virtue hit them right where they needed it brother Brown said you need salvation you need healing you got you know you got cancer you you got a broken up home you he was bringing he was pulling it out of them saying hey this is what's wrong with you now that's what he's doing now we don't have to be in a prayer line and tell us what's wrong with us that's today is Discerning by the thoughts and intents of the heart is Discerning from what the pulpit and you praying to God we didn't even get to we'll get to the to the seals because there's a there's a power that was released in those first three Church ages there was two Powers there was one power of the devil and one power of God and those same powers are here today they've not left they're right here all right and we've got to what defeat that white horse so that by the time we get to Revelations 19 brother klie we can be on a white horse ourself amen but we'll be on the right one that's right we won't be on the Roman cuz there was a white horse went out to conquer and to conquer conquering and to conquer that was the devil that's right on a white horse deceiving me and you yes but all in Revelations 19 I'll
