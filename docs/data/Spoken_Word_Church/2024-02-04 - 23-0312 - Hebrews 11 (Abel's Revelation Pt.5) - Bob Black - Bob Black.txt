========================================

man God bless you Saints on this dreary rainy morning it's good to see you out with the time change might have a few stragglers but that's all right I was uh I was working yesterday in the in the garage painting and uh listening to spoken word of the original seed and uh just having a good time and kept running back into the house to write notes but that's why I I got paint on my hands so if you see me today that's why I'm my hands aren't dirty just I couldn't get it off but um you know I was thinking about how it's a little bit uh the time change and everything it's a little bit might be a little bit hard to stay awake today but um brother Brandon was you go back and listen to the spoken word is the original SE when brother Brandon was preaching that after people had sat for hours and he kept asking the people are y'all y'all still okay and sometimes sometimes you know know it's just a little bit hard but we we just keep pressing on so I'm going to read this little quote and then we'll read our scripture and just kind of go into the study uh this morning and brother R said in questions and answerers on Hebrews he said there was no Bible speaking of of able there was no Bible wrote then but God revealed to him that it wasn't fruit that brought us out of the Garden of Eden it wasn't apples that Adam and Eve ate it was absolutely sexual things that had separated them and divided them and knowing that they become mortal think about that knowing that they become mortal and through the blood of Adam and through the blood of the serpent that had started this Abel by divine revelation went and got a lamb and offered it and God said that's it so we'll read our scripture let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together this morning there's no place I'd rather be this morning with all the all the rain and all the all the clouds than in church this morning sitting together with your Saints Lord and I pray God that you'll as we just study these things out Lord that you'll give us understanding Lord that you help us to understand the mystery of these things and Grant it Lord that you'll just be with brother Wade as he's preparing Lord help us Lord to have the right attitude this morning and this afternoon to receive what you've got in store for us today we ask it in your name amen so in verse four of Hebrews chapter 11 says by faith abble offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than gain by which he obtained witnessed that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh now we know as we've been studying this script this this this chapter out that that only way you can you can be acceptable to God that you can make God happy we'll say it like that is by Faith by Revelation in his word and and like like we kind of laid the foundation as we were going through the book of Hebrews that Paul's trying to get us impress in our minds that that God has given us his promises and the god that cannot lie made the promise and all these things that God spoke to us so let's let's uh let's trust God and really the whole the whole doctrine of serpent seed and all these things are it's really about love do you love God enough to just have confidence in him to stay with what he said or are you going to start you let wondering eyes look at look at the LIE of the devil so uh God's going to have a bride in this age that stays so true to him until she just becomes one with him until she's not not even one word off right you know you sometimes we you meditate on that you think it's it's almost beyond your reach no God God Made A Way by sending us the profit to if you go back and listen to the spoken word is Original Seed brother bramman said at the end of that he said it looks like it it looks like I get to people into a place where it's it's uh you know everything's just messed up all the doctrine is messed up nobody's preaching right all these kind of things but God gave a promise that I will restore I'm going to get off my notes I'm going try to stay on track so in wisdom versus faith brother R said by faith Abel saw the Revelation the vision and brought a living running blood because life was in the blood and I I got a little the little bee over there pollinating flowers cuz we're talking about life life is in the stem of the flower and it's botney life which has no feeling I was in hopes that would so in Abel by faith see he's comparing B plant life and animal life the reason why why Abel brought the lamb cuz he couldn't bring plants like like uh Cain did but but animals got some feeling with it it's got It's it's something that we can be identified with AEL by faith staying with the word by faith not by wisdom by faith he seen that it was blood the blood cell comes from the male the man has the blood cell the hemoglobin as the blood comes through the male and Adam know that it wasn't apples and peaches and potatoes or whatever it was that brought them out of the Garden of Eden that caused the sin it was blood and he offered blood back and uh I don't we I don't know if we got any kids this morning I'm trying to speak with discretion most of the kids should be in Sunday school so anyway y'all can read the words on the uh by faith he done it not by wisdom how is a man through wisdom going to understand it when the whole Bible and the whole Church of God is built upon divine revelation by faith now you know it's it's a topic that you got to be a little bit Frank with and I I was thinking well you know brother Brandon preached it brother Brandon preached these words and there were people sitting in there a mixed multitude and whatever so it's it's it's it's a Doctrine that's got to be shared so anyway anyway we're going to we're going to forge ahe the in in the in the indictment brother Bron said here is the light Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever forsake your Creeds and believe this word this is the truth the word is truth Jesus said my word are Spirit my word is life how are you going to receive life when you reject life how are you going to take in a Dogma which is death and a Word of Life turn out the word of life to take death how you going to accept the two at the same time you can't do it let every man's word be a lie and every Dogma a lie God's word is the truth now now what's he talking about as we kind of laid the foundation last time it all starts in the womb of your mind you listen to a lie of the devil and of course that's that's the greatest battle ever fought the Battle it out is it true or not when the when when somebody says something to you and and and you have to you have to work out is it does it match up with God's word or not because God's word is is the thing that we hang all of our hopes and everything on it's if if it's not God's word we got to throw it away and the spoken word is the Original Seed he said now let's go back now and pick up again and come down for something you remember what last Sunday service was the gate to the soul now there is a womb of the physical there is a womb for the spirit did you believe that there is a spiritual womb and a physical womb and the mind is the womb to the spirit and we covered these scriptures last time that Paul told Timothy consider what I say and the Lord give thee understanding in all things and in Luke chapter 8 we know the parable the parable is the seed the seed is the word of God and in the mark of the beast he said now what happens the heart is a womb and Faith cometh by open ear that's not been sealed by theology Faith cometh by hearing to hear the word comes into the mind you make up your mind about it is that right could that be right well the Bible said so I believe it down into the heart it goes then it's a womb oh you think about that now that that as you re receiving the word that you you hold it in your in your heart hold it you think about it and you meditate on it and you begin you begin to as you meditate on it you you're aligning yourself with the word and you say well that's it's that's what the Bible says that's what the scripture says it says that I can be healed it says that I can be says there's a promise for the Holy Ghost and you begin to believe that and something begin you're you're it's it's a womb it begins to develop and begins to grow and mature until finally it's birth that's that's how you get a new birth you you you receive that word in the womb of your heart and you just keep hanging on to it and sooner or later now what are we talking about what happened in the garden that Eve received that lie and just you can receive what you you receive that the LIE of the devil or the truth of the word of God and you either one of those you hang on to it it's going to produce so how that's why that's how that that baby that that that uh that Eve ended up holding in her arms that's how it was produced because she received the LIE of the devil and the mark of the beast he said then the then the male sex we are the bride the woman the seed goes into the church then the male sex which is the blood cell the blood of Christ is applied and in the blood comes a germ of life that goes into the seed and brings forth a newborn baby crying ABA father ABA father my God my God why did I ever do those things my god there you are and the spoken word is the Original Seed he said that's how adultery is committed spiritually and I got a little girl looking at grabbing cookies she's like you you doing something that you know you ought not to do he but knowing better by the word of God by the Intercourse of the Mind take in a lie of the devil against the word of God that's exactly what Eve done with a spiritual intercourse first that come by believe in Satan's lie into the womb of her mind that polluted her soul set death in the soul then the N then the natural act taken place and that's the only way that a woman ever can commit adultery against her husband is to first let some man talk her into it and then receive another man that's not her husband then she's committed adultery and the spoken word is the Original Seed again brother BR said and when the church today has call themselves Pentecostal call themselves Baptist whatever they want to when they high breath this word with Dogma it produces a dead child and she can't have no life in oh oh what a powerful quote that is to think you you say you look in the Bible and you say well this is how to be baptized and then you mix something else with it then well you you're going to be it can't produce nothing you say that the promise of the Holy Ghost is for you and then you throw in some other things well because of your mom and daddy wasn't married you can't receive the new birth or something something strange like that then all a sudden you you how are you going to have faith on that you mix something in there and you you it it just destroys your your confidence but if you just look straight to the word and say if there's a promise laying there I can have it then you hold it in the womb of your of your mind and begin just begin to meditate on that and it's going to produce God said I'll throw her in a bed of worldliness and kill her children God said so in Revelation how many knows that's true he said oh you can't make the word lie it's the truth and in the spoken word is the Original Seed again he said so Jehovah's bride went wh and what did she do she brought forth a bunch of illegitimates again is that right we know it's the truth even had to be taken away by King Nebuchadnezzar and so forth Christ bride has done the same what's the matter can't wait just can't wait oh you see why he keeps hammering that About Eve Eve couldn't wait she had she wanted to get like sometimes you know oh you you know you've seen that all around the message somebody wants to know more than everybody else somebody wants to have a greater Revelation and so instead of instead of just waiting on God for that they jump to it and then they get off they get off kilter and go off into something strange and that's that's exactly what Eve did she just couldn't wait for God to come on the scene and reveal it reveal interpret his word and show how the word was going to be made manifest and prove the word but she jumped she jumped the gun they got to Manu manufacture something they can't wait for the Holy Spirit to come and get into the church oh you see how that's happened in so many people's lives too they instead of waiting they they they they want to manufacture something and be a be a fake believer see if you jump and you and you can't wait then all of a sudden you're just a religious go uh person going to church you got uh trying to go through the motions and appear outwardly like you're like you're genuine because you couldn't wait now you're trying to manufacture it and try to force it but if you'll just wait God will give something genuine if you'll just wait that's right he said if it had stayed the way it was back Yonder 100 years ago ago or 50 years ago when Pentecost first started out in this Latter day when the word began to be preached if it had stayed like that she probably wouldn't have have had wouldn't had over 50 members today that's right but they would be Blood Washed they'd have the power of God in them the world will be shaken under her tremendous impact of the word flesh being spoken word by word but today why he's talking of the Pentecostal Church why it's a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol that that's right just become nonsense a laughing block a disgrace to the world disgrace to God why cuz they couldn't wait to wait on the just wait if you if you want if you're seeking the new birth if you're seeking any any promise of God just wait wait on the Lord and try to try to jump jump forward and manufacture just wait and be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord is what David said in Psalms be still and know that I am God that's what we've got inscribed over the the little uh wood there above our heads just just just be still and wait and just just let the word begin to mature in the womb of your mind until it produces just wait on him be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the earth if you wait and let it now if we just want to summarize some of the things that we've been kind of studying I these are my notes on the left and then the things that brother R said on the right that when God promises something and you don't understand it just wait on him to bring the true interpretation cuz that's how so many people have gotten off the track as they try oh well I I don't understand this so I'm just going to jump and we're going all of a sudden well now now we're we're in the Millennium i' I've been seeing that on Facebook all the time and it just we ain't in the millenum if we're in the Millennium where's brother brand at if we're in the Millennium I want to talk to the Saints I I want to be able to if we're in the Millennium where's the where's the temple that the Jews are supposed to build and all all the you know just everything don't add up but but see you just it's because we don't that people don't we don't you know all of us all of us are guilty in some form or another we're just not waiting wait on the Lord and he'll bring the true interpretation failing to wait on God Satan is there to deceive just like Eve if you if you fail to wait you and you jump you try to try to try to get that with I'm I'm going after wisdom I'm going to I'm going to be I want to know more than the next person I want to if you fail to wait on God Satan is right there ready to deceive you and what in your Pursuit you want to know you want to know things we all are here because we want to know but let's let's let's wait on God cuz he'll reveal it in his time and the word of God is a seed that incubated if it's incubated in a believing mind it's going to bring forth life and Satan's lie when incubated in a doubting mind is going to bring forth death now that's that's uh if you really think about that that's that'll answer a lot of questions brother R said what is it the mind is the womb for the spirit what to take in or let out that's how they commit adultery is taking let some Satan devil Spirit put in them something against the word of God then she's committed adultery Eve receive listen to this wrong seed word Satan's lie against Jehovah's word and the results was death and then again in another place he said when the Bride of Jesus Christ L man-made Creeds and dogm must take the place of the word of God she is committing adultery the spoken word is the Original Seed again he said now Jehovah had a bride once Adam had a bride Jesus had a bride Jehovah had a bride you know that he had to put her away she become a so he put her away that's exactly what he said she become a prostitute it's it's interesting go you go back and listen to brother Bram on the spoken word is the Original Seed and and it's like everybody just kind of draws back back when he starts speaking Frank and uh uh I I kind of got I I wanted to get up I wanted to be in that congregation and just encourage it preach it cuz you can tell everybody everybody's you know oh I don't know she become a prostitute what caused her to do that I wish we had time to read it I may get to some of it after a while right now it was in the time of Samuel when Israel had a king a God and she was a virgin she was going to produce something now look brother R he's laying out for us how how how you can tell if the church or if a person is going off into spiritual adultery cuz what they do instead of looking at the word they start looking at something else they start like Israel Israel had a promise of God and instead of looking at what they had that God had given them leadership and his spiritual leadership they started looking at something well I'd rather be like that over there as soon as oh as soon as uh a a young man or a young lady or somebody in the church soon as they start looking off at the world and say well I want to be like that oh that's that's dangerous territory God has given you the the ability to live a holy Christian Life and and you start looking up well I I I think I'd like to I I wish I could do my hair like them I I wish I could I wish I could uh put little earrings in my ears and stuff and that's that's going off into that's exactly dangerous territory he said he he said she began to look around and see the other nations had Kings she she wanted to be like the rest of them and he said you backwash Pentecost that's exactly what you done that's a picture of what I got here that that that this is a Pentecostal church but now where God at one point wanted the Pentecostals to be uh the the the light of where he could he could manifest his power in in their services and speaking in tongues and moving of the spirit and God manifesting and now it's turned into a a big show like a circus almost where you come in and there's smoke machines and lights and glass pulpits and all all of that kind of stuff but it's so different why because they failed to wait on God and they ran and and and and and rushed and tried to manufacture something and looking off at the world to see if they could do something do something else see it all goes back to what they're talking about Cain and Abel Abel was based his his his his approach to God was based on a revelation and Cain was based on just intellectual understanding trying to manufacture something and not not being willing to take God's provided way and the mark of the beast brother R said your heart is a womb you know what I'm speaking of women and men your heart is a womb and the womb holds the seed and the seed is the gospel now the seed alone in his heart no matter how many gas you sat under no matter how great your pastor is and how much you've read the Bible it'll never take life until the germ of life has come to it a woman's seed is a wonderful thing it's the building of a body but it has no life it can't it's impossible it has no life to begin with so no matter how much you know the Bible and how well it is in your heart you're still a sinner I'm trying to I hope these slides are in the right order I think this kind of got a lot a little bit order but anyway a baby's going to grow in the wom and it's going to come forth so and the spoken word is the Original Seed he said this was both physical and spiritual with Eve both physical and spiritual mix mixing it up the truth the truth and error mixing it up in the spiritual and the physical first and any time he said I told you and asked you this morning sisters to forgive me so I can mention that anytime that a woman takes the wrong step I'm talking about Christ and the bride now but anytime a woman takes a wrong step she has to First receive it in her mind right some Slicker has to persuade her and she listens to it against her own better judgment then the ACT is committed so first it hit Satan hit Eve's mind and in the womb of her mind she doubted God's word then come the actual act and there's where you get you get finally there come little babies and brother R said whenever there's a Revival it always produces twins that's a rude remark but it's true when there was a birth out of from Isaac and Rebecca It produced twins when the world was created It produced twins two trees and when Cain and Abel were born It produced two when Ishmael and Isaac was born It produced two and when Esau and Jacob was born It produced two one of them what natural one of them of the Earth the other one Supernatural and one looked at the natural intellectual the other one walked by the spirit it's always been that way now we got we just got five more minutes I'm just going to read read a few more quotes before we close brother I'm said in the Ephesian Church H he said now the the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man she's an adulteress and is no longer married and the husband is not to take her back that word was true in Eden as it was true when Moses wrote it in the law the word came can't change now he's explaining where where why we believe that an Adam all die the word can't change Adam took her back he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyway she was a part of him and he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself he would not let her go so Eve conceived by him he knew she would he knew exactly what would happen to the human race and he sold the human race into sin that he might have Eve for he loved her and those and so those two sons were born sons that would be the fathers of the human race that was even now polluted y you think about you think about the situation just if we could you you ever just meditate on this story this story is so rich you think about the situation that Adam was in that he that Eve had come out of his side she was part of him she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and spirit of his spirit Spirit the same and and he's looking at her and she's made this she's made this mistake and now he's he's like he's he's he wants to be able to go and and redeem her but it's just not in him it was in Christ it's in Christ to go out and and and take on our sin and and die on the cross and redeem us back to himself but it wasn't in him so it's like Adam Adam tried to do it and he and he got stuck in the mud he got he got covered in the filth and couldn't get back so Adam he knew going into it he knew the situation that was going to result from him going and and and go going out with Eve he knew the predicament that it was going to put the human race in he knew that it was going to it what what was going to happen and he went and did it now look look what brother said in the spoken word is the Original Seed she got in a hurry and what did she do she crossed her seed she mingled it with the serpent seed and what when she did she brought her what did she bring she brought a a child of death now see that Adam knew this was going to happen a child that she perverted every child after that now now these are some weighty quotes because you start realizing that this is maybe different than a lot of people in the message believe they uh well let's let's just read the quotes he said what was the what was the seed of the serpent adultery you follow it adultery with Eve what happened to that what brought that forth an adultery another synonym for that is infidelity infidelity is the breaking of a promise in James chapter 4 and we we'll we'll close on this maybe James said from whence come Wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lust at war in your members ye lust and have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and War yet ye have not because you ask not ye ask and receive not because you ask aiss that you may consume it upon Your Lust he's talking about lust now ye adulterers and adulteresses know you not that the Friendship of the world is enity with God whosoever there therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God and brother R said in the pergan church age he said and what is it spoke of here in the church the spiritual adultery spiritual adultery is when you're you profess to be a Christian and you're still living like the world you're you're instead of looking at what God promised you're looking off at the world looking at at all the things the world offers in first John it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not even in for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God forever abideth forever and and I said we were going to close on that slide but we'll close on this that's what Bam's teaching was to get the people off looking away from the promise of God and and to to to think that it just don't matter it don't really matter what you believe and start looking at at at at at at Moab and and like brother R said the hair and the biscuit where they came from and they wanted to be to to try to be like Moab and where they come from instead of the promises of God B Bam's preaching was that we're all the same but brother R said and aned ones at the end time we are not the same we are not the same and we'll we'll pick up on that next time God bless you Saint the musicians should go ahead and come [Applause] forward
