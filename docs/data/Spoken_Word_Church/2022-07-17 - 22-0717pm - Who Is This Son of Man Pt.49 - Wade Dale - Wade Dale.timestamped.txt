[36:01] amen
[36:02] but uh it's uh we're all ready to go
[36:04] so uh all mine's clear
[36:06] listen to this i pulled up this one
[36:07] today and i i want to read this
[36:09] resurrection of jesus 19 and 56 that's
[36:11] what brother brown says
[36:13] he never sends anyone empty who comes to
[36:15] him
[36:17] and he will send you away with a full
[36:19] heart of joy light-footed and going down
[36:21] the street rejoicing and praising god
[36:24] as you move along but now look there's a
[36:27] stipulation to that
[36:29] now that can be done if you'll take
[36:33] our right attitude if we'll take our
[36:35] right attitude toward him
[36:38] if we come to see him and to love him
[36:40] and to worship him then god is obligated
[36:43] to give us them things which we desire
[36:47] and he will uphold withhold no good
[36:49] thing from them that walk up right
[36:51] before him just remember that his
[36:53] promise is if you abide in me and my
[36:54] words abide in you ask what you will and
[36:56] it will be given unto you listen to this
[36:57] what a promise
[36:59] unfailing
[37:00] promises
[37:02] unfailing
[37:04] promises and remember the prophet of god
[37:05] told us that we are what feeding on the
[37:08] unfailing body word
[37:10] of the son of man amen
[37:15] that's us
[37:17] in the end time the body word of the son
[37:18] of man i'm looking at it right now there
[37:20] is no body of jesus that i can look at
[37:22] today it's in another dimension actually
[37:25] sitting on the throne making
[37:26] intercession like we were talking about
[37:28] today making an intercession on your
[37:30] confession
[37:31] so he sent up he sent the holy ghost to
[37:34] a bride
[37:36] and now we're doing the speaking and i
[37:38] pray to god that we hear from him today
[37:40] so let's bow our heads dear lord thank
[37:42] you for this evening

[39:59] there
[40:01] because it's you
[40:03] father just give us our daily bread
[40:04] jesus name we pray
[40:06] amen
[40:07] who is this son of man
[40:09] this would be part 49 but we're going to
[40:11] use pretty much the same
[40:14] scriptures in the beginning was the word
[40:16] the word was with god and the word was
[40:17] god and the word was made flesh and
[40:19] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[40:21] the glory of the only begotten of the
[40:22] father
[40:23] full of grace and truth romans 12 verse
[40:25] 2 says be not conformed to this world
[40:29] but be transformed by the renewing of
[40:31] your mind
[40:32] that you may prove what is that good and
[40:34] acceptable and perfect
[40:37] will of god for i say through the grace
[40:39] given unto me to every man that is among
[40:41] you not to think of himself more highly
[40:43] than he ought to think but to think
[40:44] soberly
[40:46] see there's no way
[40:49] god never set this program up for a
[40:50] hierarchy except for him
[40:54] because he's our creator
[40:56] he's mr perfect he's mr big god he's
[40:59] being he's mr god
[41:01] there ain't no one beside him they ain't
[41:03] one coming and they won them before him
[41:05] he's the only one there is
[41:06] but he decided to have kids
[41:09] he decided to bring us to a place and
[41:11] have apostles prophets pastors teachers
[41:13] and evangelists and different things
[41:14] like that but we should never we should
[41:17] always have the uh the attitude of a
[41:19] servant even song leaders even even
[41:21] school of the teachers and all we should
[41:23] have the the heart of a servant to where
[41:25] we serve
[41:27] me every time i walk out that door i say
[41:29] lord though i bear castaway though my
[41:31] head hurts though my feet hurt brother
[41:32] dales had to stand here and hold on to
[41:34] this pulpit and preach when he didn't
[41:35] feel good
[41:36] but you know what he did it for you
[41:39] no one else you i'm not doing this for
[41:41] myself you think i'd rather be out
[41:42] hunting fishing sometimes while i'm
[41:44] studying for two sermons and y'all are
[41:45] out working on cars and going to you
[41:49] know going places there's nothing wrong
[41:50] with that that's your job that's your
[41:52] position amen
[41:54] but if we all get in our position then
[41:56] we will what receive from god
[41:58] so that's why i want to receive
[41:59] something from god today amen
[42:01] i don't want to be a an overlord or a
[42:03] ruler no way no we want to be a servant
[42:07] he gave his life for us
[42:09] he didn't have to he washed our feet he
[42:11] didn't have to
[42:12] he gave his life for us according as god
[42:14] hath dealt to every man the measure
[42:17] of faith for as we as members in one
[42:18] body and all members have not the same
[42:20] office
[42:21] so we being many are one body in christ
[42:23] and one i keep reading this because as
[42:26] we go up the statue of perfect man if we
[42:28] ever get to it when we start up the
[42:29] statue of perfect man we're going to see
[42:31] those different offices working
[42:33] okay
[42:34] virtue knowledge temperance all these
[42:36] different things so we be many are one
[42:38] body in christ and everyone remembers
[42:40] one of another because remember in this
[42:42] body right here in this body of christ
[42:44] without the head now the headstone we
[42:45] know is here
[42:46] with us but we're the body so we're the
[42:49] hands the feet the toes
[42:51] the ribs the chest we're that part of
[42:54] god so we're many members and we move
[42:56] because the head tells us to move that's
[42:58] why we have to have a renewing of our
[43:00] mind
[43:02] like i said this morning everything
[43:04] if if you stay in your regular life
[43:07] that's what the world calls normal
[43:10] we're not normal
[43:12] by the way we act and do we're not
[43:15] normal
[43:16] wow jesus wasn't normal either they
[43:18] hated him
[43:20] they hated that man when he came up the
[43:21] only people that really liked him
[43:23] was the maniac of gadara and different
[43:26] ones
[43:27] oh thank you lord for coming
[43:29] according
[43:30] having then gifts differing according to
[43:32] the grace that is given to us whether
[43:34] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[43:36] the proportion of faith you may be
[43:38] seated in the lord's blessing to the
[43:39] reading of the word we will talk about
[43:40] this morning
[43:42] we were talking about being born again
[43:44] now we've got to be brother brown said
[43:46] have faith and be born again we'll talk
[43:47] about that a little bit later we'll skip
[43:49] through this pretty quick
[43:51] but we as many of us are led by the
[43:52] spirit of god they are the sons of god
[43:54] so we are by the new birth we become
[43:57] sons and daughters of god amen
[44:00] and and we realize
[44:02] that yes in the listen in the mind of
[44:04] god
[44:05] we are we always were the sons of god
[44:07] because if you weren't there you'll
[44:08] never be there
[44:10] everybody with me
[44:12] but
[44:12] we got lost
[44:15] something got lost
[44:16] so that we can have a savior a healer we
[44:20] can
[44:21] sing the songs of redemption
[44:23] the angels can't sing those songs
[44:25] we can sing the song of redemption why
[44:28] because we were lost
[44:31] and i thank god we were lost
[44:33] well preacher you're tough you're you're
[44:35] tough you're i thank god i got lost
[44:44] think about that for a minute
[44:48] because the finding part is what i like
[44:54] if we have not but we have not received
[44:56] the spirit of bondage again to fear
[44:58] but we have received the spirit of
[45:00] adoption whereby we cry
[45:02] have a father the spirit of self bearing
[45:03] witness with our spirit that what that
[45:05] we are the children of god so you had to
[45:07] start as a baby you had to start as a
[45:09] child didn't you start your
[45:11] human journey as a baby
[45:13] as a child but like i said before you
[45:15] know you i don't want you to stay a baby
[45:19] i mean some of us are babies
[45:21] let's don't be 50 year old babies
[45:24] that's not normal
[45:26] and if children then heirs theirs of god
[45:28] and join heirs with christ listen god
[45:31] christ jesus is coming back after a
[45:33] mature bride he's not coming back after
[45:35] he doesn't want you to stay a baby
[45:37] if he didn't want you to stay a baby in
[45:39] your natural life he sure doesn't want
[45:40] you to stay a baby in your spiritual
[45:42] life man he wants you to grow that's
[45:44] what i said come to church and say teach
[45:46] me something lord
[45:47] teach me something i know some of us
[45:49] went to school and hated it but i didn't
[45:51] i liked it because i like to learn
[45:53] i know i'm not normal but that's okay
[45:56] i wanted to learn something i didn't
[45:57] want to stay
[45:58] ignorant it's not bad to be ignorant
[46:01] it's bad to stay ignorant
[46:03] because that becomes iniquity
[46:05] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[46:07] and joint heirs with christ whatever
[46:08] jesus got we got
[46:10] whatever christ gets we get all right so
[46:13] christ has these virtues and guess what
[46:15] he's ready to give them out to me and
[46:16] you if we want them amen
[46:20] and joint heirs with christ if so be
[46:21] that we suffer with him that we may be
[46:23] also glorified together we went through
[46:25] justification we know one thing's for
[46:27] sure we needed that
[46:29] and we can't justify ourselves our
[46:31] problem is is when we justify ourself
[46:35] and then we make it somebody else's
[46:36] fault
[46:40] sanctification
[46:42] unclean spirit goes out of your soul
[46:45] hello somebody
[46:47] don't get quiet on me today now this
[46:48] morning y'all we're doing pretty good
[46:49] let's don't get quiet this afternoon you
[46:51] can say a man through your sleepy eyes
[46:54] but the unclean spirit goes out
[46:57] something left you
[46:59] you felt different what he was he was
[47:01] starting the renewal of your mind
[47:05] because listen when you was out in the
[47:07] world did you want to be justified oh
[47:09] yeah we want to be justified like the
[47:10] world's justified that they want to be
[47:13] excuse me but i'm going to say lgbt
[47:15] black lives matter they all want to be
[47:17] justified we're justified because we are
[47:21] brackets whatever you want to say all
[47:22] right i'm justified because i had
[47:25] somebody that did it for me
[47:28] i didn't depend on me or the court or
[47:33] i depend on god to do it and when he
[47:36] said in his bible that he would throw
[47:38] him in the sea of forgetfulness never to
[47:40] remember him again i'm going to take
[47:42] that
[47:44] but you and i can't do that
[47:47] we still remember it
[47:49] that's why we need a renewing of our
[47:50] mind but you need a heart change first
[47:54] because you can't think normal without
[47:56] the new birth i'm talking about
[47:58] christian normal now everybody else
[47:59] thinks normal because this is normal and
[48:01] that's normal
[48:03] it's okay to have this and it's okay to
[48:05] be a girl one day and a boy the next day
[48:07] and come on somebody
[48:09] i told you they gonna quit having gender
[48:11] reveal parties because you're not
[48:12] supposed to decide what they are they're
[48:13] supposed to decide who they are
[48:15] come on
[48:18] oh let a kid decide what he wants to be
[48:22] they ought to be the ones that get
[48:23] spanked not the kids
[48:25] whoever decides stupid stuff like that
[48:27] but listen that's sodom and gomorrah all
[48:29] over again that's the twisting of the
[48:31] mind
[48:32] that satan has twisted your mind up so
[48:34] bad
[48:36] listen
[48:38] i know
[48:40] that i'm a man
[48:42] because god said i'm a man
[48:45] but you know what
[48:46] though this is how satan's perverted it
[48:50] i'm also a bride
[48:53] i'm also feminine in nature
[48:56] come on
[48:58] but i know the difference
[49:00] and my god knows the difference
[49:03] but the world's god don't know the
[49:04] difference
[49:05] he just tries to mix them all together
[49:07] but yes i am bride
[49:09] so i am feminist in that part
[49:11] but i'm also a man a human man so i'm
[49:13] gonna mess it up you better not mess it
[49:14] up either
[49:16] so there's a part of the renewing of
[49:17] your mind we keep it's like sister
[49:19] regina and i were talking about
[49:21] and and and i say this in
[49:27] i guess that's the way i can say it
[49:29] she's talking about being being your
[49:30] mind and your eyes being raped
[49:33] and that's true because you walk out in
[49:34] the world
[49:36] and you see things
[49:38] that just absolutely boggles your brain
[49:41] and you would have never thought that
[49:43] would ever happen
[49:44] ever
[49:46] never thought that would happen and then
[49:48] you're seeing them with your what the
[49:50] the eyes of an outlet to your soul
[49:53] so whatever you see you better have that
[49:56] filter
[49:57] you better have that thing that says
[49:59] whoops that's not right
[50:00] because what it's going to do it's going
[50:02] to go deep down and if it has nothing to
[50:04] stop it it's going to go right down into
[50:06] your soul
[50:07] and it's going to what it's going to
[50:08] send you to hell hell on earth
[50:12] it's already started
[50:14] let them have it though
[50:16] let them have it
[50:18] let god renew my mind that i can throw
[50:20] it through that filter come wipe me
[50:23] put it in that filter and kick it out
[50:27] let god kick it out
[50:29] because we're humans we have a human
[50:30] nature we have thoughts we have ideas we
[50:32] have all these different things but we
[50:34] have a soul
[50:35] to make a choice
[50:38] and right here he says i'll give you a
[50:39] new spirit now that's not the holy
[50:40] spirit because that spirit isn't god's
[50:42] spirit that's your spirit that's giving
[50:44] you a spirit
[50:46] that's different
[50:47] than what it used to be that's in
[50:49] sanctification that's not the new birth
[50:52] i keep harping on that because a lot of
[50:54] people as brother brown says come under
[50:56] a conviction of sanctification god gets
[50:59] where you get rid of all these things
[51:01] and you start coming to church
[51:02] and you start reading your bible but
[51:04] unless you're born again you're just put
[51:06] aside for service you're not put in
[51:08] service
[51:09] all right i want god to put me in
[51:11] service you need that's what we want to
[51:12] do as the bride as a body
[51:15] i want to be in service
[51:18] i don't want to be a statue
[51:20] i want to be a stature
[51:22] all right a statue is
[51:25] it doesn't move
[51:26] i want to move for god
[51:28] those songs
[51:30] that brother christian that moved me
[51:33] now the world would probably look at it
[51:34] and go what are you talking about
[51:37] but we as christians we we feed on that
[51:40] just like they feed on their music we
[51:42] feed on ours
[51:43] and it feeds our soul it gives a calming
[51:45] it gives us it gives us something to
[51:47] draw on amen because that is a ministry
[51:50] to get the people to see
[51:52] that god loves you
[51:54] god cares about you
[51:56] god's there for you in song as i said
[51:59] the other day look at what happened to
[52:00] saul saul was vexed by evil spirits
[52:04] he was walking through the
[52:06] through the castle one day and he said
[52:08] hmm that sounds good
[52:10] he walks in there and there's david
[52:13] playing the harp
[52:15] singing the songs to god you know what
[52:18] the bible said
[52:20] from then on he would call david in
[52:22] now david was his enemy he didn't like
[52:24] david
[52:25] but he would call david in to play music
[52:27] to what to push to drive those evil
[52:28] spirits out maybe we need to start
[52:30] singing some good christian songs
[52:33] maybe it'll drive some of these spirits
[52:34] we got away so i'll spit my spin just
[52:36] just to talk i'll put my spirit in him
[52:38] but the thing god has to do is give you
[52:40] a new spirit make your what nature
[52:44] nature a little more gentle and settle
[52:46] down or he can't even live with you
[52:49] the baptism of my holy ghost do it holy
[52:51] ghost then though is when god puts his
[52:53] spirit inside of you
[52:55] he puts the love of god something that
[52:57] no one in this world can ever ever
[53:00] replace
[53:01] is agape love
[53:03] filial love can be replaced daily
[53:06] amen
[53:08] that's why i said many times famous
[53:09] bleeding
[53:12] not with god
[53:15] he's a just god
[53:17] and like i said before if he loves you
[53:19] now
[53:20] he loves you then
[53:22] he loves you now he'll love you forever
[53:24] amen
[53:25] seeing you have purified your souls and
[53:27] obeying the truth through the spirit of
[53:28] the unfainted love of the brethren
[53:30] that's why under sanctification the
[53:32] prophet of god tells us he said he said
[53:34] you're put in a religious order you
[53:36] start you start doing religious things
[53:38] you start going to church reading your
[53:40] bible that's in sanctification not the
[53:42] new birth that's in sanctification you
[53:44] start doing things different you start
[53:46] going i'm not going there anymore i'm
[53:48] not doing this what's that doing that's
[53:50] driving those unclean spirits out amen
[53:54] but now remember if you wait long enough
[53:56] though
[53:57] and you quit going to church and you
[53:58] quit reading your bible after a while
[54:00] and you quit doing this
[54:03] guess what's going to happen
[54:05] that heads you got built around you
[54:07] god's going to say i don't think you
[54:09] really believe me
[54:11] so he let some evil spirits come right
[54:12] back in
[54:14] and makes you really religious
[54:16] still come still come to church but just
[54:18] every once in a while now
[54:20] anyway
[54:23] seeing you have purified your soul and
[54:25] obeying the truth through the spirit
[54:26] under what unfeigned love of the
[54:28] brethren see that you love one another
[54:29] with a pure heart
[54:31] fervently being born again
[54:33] not of corruptible seed but of
[54:35] incorruptible
[54:36] what is the incorruptable seed the word
[54:39] of god
[54:41] god doesn't have i'm just going to say
[54:43] it god doesn't have sperm
[54:45] he's not a god that way he doesn't have
[54:47] to have sex to make anything
[54:49] so his what the spoken word is the
[54:52] original seed his seed is in him from
[54:54] his mouth
[54:55] not from his loins that's the problem we
[54:57] have we got born the wrong way from
[54:59] earth the loins of adam and eve not from
[55:01] the spoken word of god which is the seed
[55:04] of god which is the word of god
[55:06] and you weren't born with the word of
[55:08] god inside of you or you just being an
[55:09] instant christian
[55:12] and god wouldn't have to die you
[55:13] wouldn't have to have the bible to tell
[55:14] you what's right and what's wrong
[55:17] that's why i said thank god i got lost
[55:20] but thank god i got found
[55:22] amen
[55:24] for whom he did for no he also did
[55:26] predestinate we're talking about this
[55:27] morning for knowledge is first uh for
[55:30] knowledge
[55:31] for whom he did for no he also did
[55:33] predestinate to be conformed to the
[55:35] image of his son that he might be the
[55:37] firstborn among mainly brethren
[55:39] let me try to explain it this way
[55:42] god in his infinite mind he and thank
[55:44] god that i was thinking about last night
[55:46] brother branham tells us in christ the
[55:48] mystery god revealed he said let's go
[55:50] back in the back part of god's mind
[55:52] nobody's ever been there before
[55:55] nobody
[55:56] it took a prophet to walk us into the
[55:58] mind of god but you know what i just
[56:00] said the key he walked us
[56:04] into the mind of god
[56:06] he did not say i'm going into the mind
[56:08] of god and i'm going to get this and i'm
[56:09] going to bring it out and tell you he
[56:10] said let's go back
[56:13] in the back part of god's mind let's
[56:17] let's go back
[56:19] so now we see what he sees
[56:22] and while we were in there we got
[56:24] revelation just like he got revelation
[56:30] so that we can say these things that we
[56:32] say term listen we've got terminology
[56:33] the world don't know nothing about
[56:35] denominations don't know nothing about
[56:37] that's our terminologies
[56:40] new birth oh it's just believing mama
[56:43] was good
[56:46] like daddy said pave the parking lot
[56:48] you're going to heaven
[56:49] that's your new birth out in the world
[56:51] not now not here we know better
[56:54] who me before it did
[56:57] to what to be foreign
[56:58] to the image of his son that he might be
[57:00] the firstborn among many
[57:02] brethren see we have to conform to him
[57:05] the problem is we want him to conform to
[57:07] us
[57:08] and allow us to do the human things that
[57:11] are not right
[57:13] no
[57:14] ain't gonna happen
[57:16] in my georgia english ain't gonna happen
[57:19] you may not say that in ohio but you
[57:20] understand what i said
[57:22] more more over whom he did predestinate
[57:24] then he called
[57:27] called
[57:31] and saw what you would do when he called
[57:34] and whom he called then he also
[57:36] justified he's not going to justify you
[57:38] if you don't want to be
[57:40] and whom he justified them he also
[57:43] glorified amen
[57:46] so what can we say to these things i
[57:47] didn't put that down but what did we say
[57:49] if god be for us who can be against us
[57:52] romans 11 verse 2 said god had not cast
[57:54] away his people which he foreknew
[57:56] what though he fought he didn't afford
[57:58] he just didn't foreknow donnie fall bush
[58:00] by donnie fall but his name
[58:02] he foreknew brother donnie because he
[58:04] knew what brother donnie would do when
[58:05] he got here
[58:07] so by his foreknowledge he knew what you
[58:09] would want it's still all free moral
[58:11] agency
[58:13] every person
[58:15] even the devil
[58:18] is a free mortal agent
[58:20] amen
[58:23] lucifer i created you
[58:26] perfect
[58:27] you walked among the fire of god
[58:30] you walked in heaven you walked in eden
[58:34] until iniquity
[58:36] was found in your heart
[58:38] satan made a choice
[58:41] even he listen if he had a choice then
[58:44] i'll promise you you and me got one
[58:46] you know what god made a choice
[58:50] really yeah he's god he didn't need
[58:53] anybody
[58:54] he needed nothing to exist
[58:57] but he wanted to
[58:59] because he wanted to have children
[59:02] all right let's keep going predestinated
[59:04] let's go down here and whom also you
[59:05] trusted look the bible says after that
[59:07] you heard the word of truth the gospel
[59:08] of your salvation and whom also after
[59:10] that you believe you were sealed with
[59:12] that holy spirit of promise so there's a
[59:14] what there's a work in progress wip
[59:16] work in progress we are working towards
[59:19] something all right what which is the
[59:21] earnest of your inheritance until the
[59:23] redemption of the purchase possession
[59:25] which is this guy unto the praise of his
[59:27] glory
[59:28] john 14 25 said these things have i
[59:30] spoken to you being yet present but the
[59:32] comforter which is the holy ghost whom
[59:33] the father will send in my name he's
[59:35] going to come back in other words and
[59:37] teach you all things and bring all
[59:38] things to your remembrance whatsoever i
[59:40] have said
[59:42] unto you acts 1 verse 4 this is jesus
[59:44] speaking but you shall receive power
[59:46] after look at all those afters as we
[59:48] were talking about this morning after
[59:50] that the holy ghost has come upon you
[59:52] you will receive power before that
[59:54] you're powerless
[59:57] and you shall be witnesses unto me both
[59:59] in jerusalem judea samaria
[1:00:01] utter most parts of the earth which is
[1:00:03] that word is dunamis with power which is
[1:00:06] inherent power power residing in a thing
[1:00:08] by virtue of its nature see that's why
[1:00:10] we have to have a nature change
[1:00:12] listen we didn't get a soul change
[1:00:17] your soul is you
[1:00:18] amen
[1:00:19] and you didn't have two souls
[1:00:24] one
[1:00:26] i like what brother dale said one time
[1:00:28] if you all remember this
[1:00:29] he said it's really hard
[1:00:34] to preach
[1:00:37] false doctrine
[1:00:39] because you got to make all this
[1:00:40] explanation
[1:00:42] the truth is truth
[1:00:44] but you guys you got there's georgia
[1:00:46] english explaining you guys playing this
[1:00:48] away and explaining this away and
[1:00:50] explaining this away you got you guys
[1:00:52] playing the way you guys playing god
[1:00:54] completely away if you want to believe
[1:00:56] you got two souls or you had this great
[1:00:58] something inside of you when you were
[1:01:00] born
[1:01:02] no thank you
[1:01:04] i had a soul that was rotten i had a
[1:01:05] soul that was hey listen it was given by
[1:01:08] god perfect just like satan
[1:01:11] he didn't create satan satan he created
[1:01:13] satan and satan became
[1:01:18] by choice
[1:01:20] he became evil
[1:01:22] amen
[1:01:23] you and i before the age of
[1:01:24] accountability thank god we had a
[1:01:26] prophet everybody believe god sent a
[1:01:27] prophet right okay same group all right
[1:01:30] so
[1:01:32] as a baby
[1:01:35] when you're born
[1:01:36] in this world you're perfect
[1:01:39] your soul is perfect but look it doesn't
[1:01:42] know right from wrong
[1:01:45] it's a baby
[1:01:47] can't make a choice
[1:01:48] so therefore god made a provision
[1:01:50] somewhere
[1:01:52] they said i know you're going to be a
[1:01:53] baby
[1:01:54] and i'm going to send you to heaven
[1:01:55] until you get to the age where you can
[1:01:57] decide which what you want to do
[1:02:00] because all babies go to heaven it's a
[1:02:01] prophecy god said but now what is the
[1:02:04] age of accountability you can argue all
[1:02:05] you want to it's when you know right
[1:02:06] from wrong
[1:02:08] like i said before put two put a
[1:02:10] five-year-old boy and a five-year-old
[1:02:11] girl in the bathtub
[1:02:13] they'll play all day
[1:02:15] don't put them same ones in there ten
[1:02:16] years later
[1:02:19] big difference same two people
[1:02:21] what but they've come to a knowledge of
[1:02:23] the truth they've come to a knowledge of
[1:02:25] who they are same way and that's the
[1:02:27] same way with us
[1:02:29] as a baby you're going to make mistakes
[1:02:31] you're going to fall you're going to
[1:02:33] you gotta
[1:02:36] you smile like a baby
[1:02:38] but now when you become about 16 years
[1:02:40] old
[1:02:41] stop acting like a baby
[1:02:44] you're not 16 yet are you oh good grief
[1:02:47] okay thank you
[1:02:49] but
[1:02:50] grow up how many times grow up
[1:02:53] don't smile brother michael
[1:02:55] grow up
[1:02:57] but that's what god's saying right now
[1:02:58] though
[1:03:00] but to grow up you got to go to school
[1:03:03] some of us go to school of life
[1:03:05] amen
[1:03:07] we tried that yeah we tried that got the
[1:03:09] hard knocks
[1:03:10] let's try to renew our mind and come
[1:03:12] over on this side though
[1:03:14] now i never said it was going to be easy
[1:03:17] but you'll know how to
[1:03:19] what i say before
[1:03:21] numer new birth will not take away your
[1:03:23] problems but it will help you deal with
[1:03:25] them
[1:03:27] more than this world this world they
[1:03:28] have to deal with it by drugs and pills
[1:03:30] and alcohol and all this different stuff
[1:03:32] we come to the word of god
[1:03:34] we come to the word of god we come and
[1:03:35] listen to a good holy ghost-filled
[1:03:37] preacher our teacher his brother bob
[1:03:38] different ones we you if we fill ourself
[1:03:41] with that whatever you fill yourself up
[1:03:43] with that's what you're going to be amen
[1:03:46] those who had the spirit the teacher
[1:03:48] heard the word and that spirit in them
[1:03:50] took the word and taught it revealed it
[1:03:51] to them and they were of that group that
[1:03:53] heard the messenger and his message and
[1:03:56] took it and lived it now that's where
[1:03:58] we're at today
[1:03:59] all right
[1:04:00] we are sitting in this room because of a
[1:04:02] message that came from a messenger
[1:04:05] and i hope to god we believe it
[1:04:08] and i hope to god we live it yes
[1:04:12] because we're the only people that's
[1:04:13] going to live this message
[1:04:15] nobody else can live it but me and you
[1:04:17] simon peter servant the apostle jesus
[1:04:19] christ to them that have obtained
[1:04:22] like precious faith
[1:04:24] with us through the righteousness of god
[1:04:26] and our savior jesus christ
[1:04:28] matthew 12 says i say unto you every
[1:04:30] idle word that men shall speak they
[1:04:32] shall give an account thereof in the day
[1:04:34] of judgment listen if you don't get it
[1:04:36] out now you're going to have to give an
[1:04:37] account there
[1:04:39] amen some men's sins go before some go
[1:04:41] after everybody with me
[1:04:44] you better
[1:04:45] be a forgiving person
[1:04:47] and ask for forgiveness every day of
[1:04:49] your life
[1:04:50] for by thy words thou shalt be justified
[1:04:53] and by thy words thou shalt be
[1:04:56] condemned
[1:04:57] thou shalt confess with your mouth the
[1:04:59] lord jesus and believe in your heart
[1:05:00] that god raised him from the dead thou
[1:05:02] shalt be saved for with a heart man
[1:05:04] believeth unto righteousness and with
[1:05:06] the mouth confession is made under
[1:05:07] salvation
[1:05:09] confession is to admit or declare
[1:05:10] oneself guilt
[1:05:12] of what one is accused of
[1:05:15] that's what's so strange
[1:05:18] i love this
[1:05:20] you got a man sitting on you got a man
[1:05:22] sitting on the throne
[1:05:25] the judge
[1:05:27] the attorney
[1:05:29] and the jury
[1:05:30] all in one man
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:34] he's sitting on the throne making an
[1:05:36] intercession for you because you know
[1:05:38] what the accuser the devil is there
[1:05:40] every day he shows up for court every
[1:05:42] day
[1:05:43] he's got a full docket
[1:05:45] you see what they're doing
[1:05:47] you see what that was doing over there
[1:05:51] the attorney says
[1:05:54] wait i'm sorry
[1:05:56] the attorney jumps up and says
[1:05:58] i didn't see it
[1:06:01] the jury
[1:06:03] we didn't see it
[1:06:05] the judge says
[1:06:06] he didn't do it
[1:06:09] and the devil's still going yeah but he
[1:06:11] well okay
[1:06:13] we didn't see it don't have any
[1:06:14] witnesses
[1:06:16] we can't accuse him
[1:06:18] well he didn't do it
[1:06:21] poor devil
[1:06:25] but now listen
[1:06:28] he can get an audience with god
[1:06:32] because he's the accuser of the brethren
[1:06:34] but remember in the book of revelations
[1:06:36] oh come on people in the book of
[1:06:38] revelations he's cast out
[1:06:41] he's cast out of heaven you know why
[1:06:44] because we're going to be there
[1:06:47] we don't have to anymore
[1:06:49] deal with that dude
[1:06:50] [Applause]
[1:06:52] oh he's every day oh you see that i see
[1:06:55] what that one did you see what that
[1:06:56] would do
[1:06:58] i didn't see it
[1:07:00] i didn't see it
[1:07:02] all i see is blood
[1:07:04] but when that blood's gone
[1:07:07] we walk through that blood
[1:07:09] and we get in this side
[1:07:12] he's going that way the bible says when
[1:07:15] we go up
[1:07:16] he comes down
[1:07:18] he won't be in our place anymore
[1:07:21] when we go up
[1:07:23] he comes down
[1:07:24] and there'll be no more accusing of us
[1:07:28] because there'll be nothing to accuse
[1:07:31] amen boy that ought to make you happy
[1:07:33] there'll be nothing to accuse
[1:07:35] because when he stands up off of the
[1:07:37] throne he's not an intercessor anymore
[1:07:41] he doesn't need to be
[1:07:43] what he's intercessing for is in front
[1:07:46] of him
[1:07:47] hallelujah we're there
[1:07:50] but we get a piece of it while we're
[1:07:51] here
[1:07:54] thank god that we can say lord forgive
[1:07:56] me i'm sorry i did that like sister
[1:07:58] freedom if i've done anything
[1:08:01] lord clean my slate
[1:08:04] and the intercessor says

[1:13:04] you keeping 90 and you heaping gifts on
[1:13:07] your own self
[1:13:12] promises of god
[1:13:14] and a testimony
[1:13:17] right here among us that it works now we
[1:13:19] all got that testimony how many of you
[1:13:20] have done that i mean maybe not that
[1:13:22] drastic
[1:13:24] but you paint listen that tie check goes
[1:13:26] first
[1:13:28] go first first thing you don't and don't
[1:13:30] try to figure out how to cheat god
[1:13:34] if you make a thousand dollars a week
[1:13:36] write him a hundred dollar check forget
[1:13:37] the rest
[1:13:38] but everybody's going no i think i'll
[1:13:39] take off for this and
[1:13:41] i had a couple ice creams the other day
[1:13:44] oh i bought two gallons of ice cream
[1:13:46] yeah i'll take that
[1:13:48] pay you a hundred dollars and forget it
[1:13:50] watch god stand on his promise if you
[1:13:53] stand on his he'll stand on his own
[1:13:54] promise and he'll give you a couple of
[1:13:57] bags of groceries amen
[1:13:59] what a
[1:14:01] boy tell me thank you i was gonna say if
[1:14:03] sister johnny was here she'd say what a
[1:14:05] mighty god we serve
[1:14:08] man what is sin unbelief well now see we
[1:14:10] become believers
[1:14:12] we believe in tithing we believe in
[1:14:13] going to church if you don't you're an
[1:14:15] unbeliever
[1:14:17] sorry richard roberts i said it again
[1:14:19] there's only two elements though that
[1:14:21] controls a human being that's either
[1:14:22] doubt or faith
[1:14:24] one or the other you're possessed
[1:14:27] of one that dominates your life
[1:14:31] just depends on how much faith you have
[1:14:33] is how high
[1:14:34] you can rise
[1:14:37] it's all about confession you can't do
[1:14:39] god can't do anything for you until you
[1:14:40] confess it
[1:14:43] he can't
[1:14:44] until you confess is that right for he
[1:14:46] is the high priest of what your
[1:14:48] confession
[1:14:51] i'll confess you before the father
[1:14:52] remember he'll if you stand for him
[1:14:54] he'll stand for you
[1:14:55] you get that young man
[1:14:57] now he is sitting here to make
[1:14:58] intercession on my confession and i have
[1:15:00] a right to confess that he's done
[1:15:01] anything for me that's in the redemptive
[1:15:03] blessings that's what we were just
[1:15:04] talking about there you are
[1:15:07] all right let's continue on let's get to
[1:15:08] some of this
[1:15:09] get where we need to go
[1:15:11] we talk about the divine power and then
[1:15:12] look we come to this it says add to your
[1:15:14] faith
[1:15:16] add to what all we're building up to out
[1:15:18] of this all this foundation
[1:15:20] of listen you're going to believe in
[1:15:21] something
[1:15:23] right or the old saying is you'll fall
[1:15:25] for anything
[1:15:27] but it's a war we know that because our
[1:15:29] mind is set on carnality and god is not
[1:15:33] carnal
[1:15:34] so there's your two positions
[1:15:37] and even when you get born again satan
[1:15:39] just moves out to that next realm of the
[1:15:41] spirit realm remember reasons constant
[1:15:42] affection imagination and he sits on
[1:15:44] your shoulder
[1:15:46] and he goes okay you're okay go ahead
[1:15:48] and do that
[1:15:51] no i got to have faith that god's going
[1:15:53] to renew my mind i'm not going to do it
[1:15:55] but you know what i'm going to do i'm
[1:15:56] going to put myself in a position or a
[1:15:58] place that god can do it
[1:16:00] make myself available
[1:16:03] that he can teach me make myself
[1:16:05] available that god can do what he said
[1:16:07] he would do
[1:16:08] sister um your wife your wife your
[1:16:11] mother
[1:16:12] she made herself available
[1:16:14] what if she did not paid her tithe now
[1:16:16] hold on what if she did not paid her
[1:16:17] time and she just took that little bit
[1:16:18] of money she had
[1:16:20] and spent it on cigarettes or beer and i
[1:16:22] mean i'm it's not
[1:16:24] but see if she did that now that man had
[1:16:25] never showed up on the door
[1:16:28] you can say well you don't know yeah i
[1:16:29] do know
[1:16:30] because that man was sent from god
[1:16:32] because you did because it's a reaction
[1:16:34] to an action
[1:16:36] right you gotta you gotta make an action
[1:16:38] for god to react confess
[1:16:40] to possess
[1:16:42] so the confession is first
[1:16:44] you confess that you possess
[1:16:46] all these virtues you confess that's
[1:16:48] what the whole thing i'm telling you
[1:16:49] we've got to confess that virtue is
[1:16:51] going to be in my life that knowledge is
[1:16:53] going to be in my life temperance is
[1:16:55] going to be in my life because your old
[1:16:57] carnal mind says don't worry about it
[1:17:00] just come church sit down and
[1:17:03] sleep
[1:17:06] now faith is the substance of things
[1:17:08] hoped for the evidence of things
[1:17:10] not seen now we know that without faith
[1:17:12] is impossible to please god for he that
[1:17:15] cometh to god must believe that he is in
[1:17:16] a rewarder reward her
[1:17:20] sister morales was rewarded
[1:17:23] she was rewarded because she did
[1:17:24] something
[1:17:26] she did what god said
[1:17:28] therefore look god had to react
[1:17:32] remember brother brown should call god
[1:17:34] on the scene
[1:17:35] right with the right attitude
[1:17:38] and a reward of them that diligently
[1:17:40] seek
[1:17:42] him his lovely mama when i met her the
[1:17:45] other day
[1:17:47] brother christian and them on a
[1:17:49] upholstery shop
[1:17:50] she was in the front of it she's a
[1:17:51] little bitty woman but that doll will be
[1:17:53] the woman she hugged my name she said
[1:17:55] thank you for taking care of my son
[1:18:01] i said ma'am i ain't taking care of him
[1:18:03] god is
[1:18:06] but you can't be saved without faith
[1:18:07] faith is something that you have to
[1:18:09] believe it's there
[1:18:10] that really nothing else will declare it
[1:18:13] it's there but faith so that's what
[1:18:14] we're going to talk about this afternoon
[1:18:16] we know that there's a declare there's a
[1:18:18] faith then there's a declaration even
[1:18:20] though nothing declares it there's going
[1:18:22] to be some works that's going to declare
[1:18:23] your faith
[1:18:26] okay we'll get to james in just a second
[1:18:29] now faith he that cometh to god must
[1:18:30] believe that he is and it's impossible
[1:18:32] to please god without faith you cannot
[1:18:35] please him
[1:18:36] and if you say you believe god you have
[1:18:38] never seen him see so then you've got to
[1:18:41] believe it by faith and if you could see
[1:18:43] him it would be no more faith
[1:18:45] all right like i said before when we get
[1:18:47] to glory and there stands jesus and
[1:18:48] we're in the millennium i don't have to
[1:18:50] have faith that god exists
[1:18:52] i see him with my own eyes
[1:18:54] but now what do we got to come to though
[1:18:56] we got to come to this faith and have
[1:18:58] rapturing faith oh come on somebody we
[1:19:01] got to have raptured faith that he is
[1:19:02] here
[1:19:04] in you
[1:19:06] and he's already said i am the
[1:19:08] resurrection and the life
[1:19:09] and where is that man now
[1:19:11] he's inside of you
[1:19:15] i can't well that just stops you right
[1:19:17] there i can't
[1:19:19] i don't know
[1:19:20] um but look
[1:19:23] moses had a burning bush experience
[1:19:26] and it anointed the faith
[1:19:28] that was in him
[1:19:30] oh it anoints our faith it moves us out
[1:19:33] that's why listen folks that's why we
[1:19:35] come to church that's why we listen to
[1:19:37] different ministers to get different
[1:19:38] views not different
[1:19:40] opinions but different views just like
[1:19:41] the song service today we got different
[1:19:43] songs we've never seen before
[1:19:46] and you could just feel that that was
[1:19:48] pleasing to god you could just feel that
[1:19:50] that we've never signed that here in
[1:19:52] this church ever before right
[1:19:54] a couple of those songs never but all of
[1:19:55] a sudden though here comes those songs
[1:19:57] something new
[1:19:58] something fresh
[1:20:00] and boy you just pick it it just picks
[1:20:02] up it picks everything up
[1:20:04] i hope it did you it didn't me i was
[1:20:06] sitting back there trying i was gonna
[1:20:07] run around around the chair for a minute
[1:20:09] but there's something within us
[1:20:12] we were predestinated to see this hour
[1:20:14] and there's nothing gonna stop us from
[1:20:16] seeing it
[1:20:18] amen here god has spoke it it's already
[1:20:21] happened we see it oh how we thank god
[1:20:23] for this oh then it brings out your
[1:20:25] faith when you see these things
[1:20:27] happening
[1:20:29] here
[1:20:30] so romans said please don't be conformed
[1:20:32] by the world but be transformed by the
[1:20:33] renewing of your mind
[1:20:35] then now that part
[1:20:37] renewal is renovation like i was telling
[1:20:40] y'all before i had a big old dumpster
[1:20:42] sit in front of the house the other day
[1:20:43] and we were renovating part of the house
[1:20:44] billy gary made us a new deck well you
[1:20:46] know what he did with the old parts he
[1:20:48] didn't try to use them
[1:20:50] not with that one for sure
[1:20:51] what do you do he threw him in a
[1:20:52] dumpster
[1:20:54] why didn't need them anymore
[1:20:57] unusable
[1:20:59] but we got new stuff there now
[1:21:01] we were renewed
[1:21:03] we have a new porch we can sit on now
[1:21:06] amen
[1:21:07] try that with god sometime
[1:21:09] pull the dumpster out and say god throw
[1:21:11] in there what i don't
[1:21:12] need tear it out doesn't matter
[1:21:15] brother gary wasn't out there going now
[1:21:17] let me see if i can pull that nail now
[1:21:19] no
[1:21:20] zach comes up there with the loader and
[1:21:22] he grabs it with that loading grapple
[1:21:23] and go shake shake shake
[1:21:26] that's the way i want the devil to be
[1:21:27] done
[1:21:28] i want god to bring that grappling hook
[1:21:30] and grab him by the neck and shake him
[1:21:31] and bounce him on the ground and throw
[1:21:33] him out
[1:21:34] amen
[1:21:35] oh you love your devil a lot more than i
[1:21:37] do
[1:21:39] i want that dude to be out
[1:21:41] when they come and took the garbage off
[1:21:43] i didn't follow the garbage going hey
[1:21:44] wait a minute
[1:21:47] no i said good riddance
[1:21:49] bye-bye
[1:21:51] throw it in the seat of god's
[1:21:52] forgetfulness put it in the
[1:21:54] landfill never to be remembered again
[1:21:58] i like where brother aaron said what is
[1:22:00] it aaron if you haven't used something
[1:22:01] for seven months or seven
[1:22:03] if you hadn't used something for seven
[1:22:05] years you really didn't need it
[1:22:07] so if you hadn't touched some of your
[1:22:08] stuff for seven years throw it away all
[1:22:10] right
[1:22:11] now if you haven't touched your husband
[1:22:12] or wife don't do that
[1:22:14] for seven years you need to you need a
[1:22:16] renovation
[1:22:18] a complete change for the better
[1:22:22] but remember you're contrary to god
[1:22:26] you are contrary to god you were born
[1:22:28] contrary to the way god wanted you to
[1:22:30] come but what's he doing by the renewing
[1:22:31] of your mind he's telling us now look he
[1:22:34] honestly is telling us i know i was born
[1:22:36] in sin shape and iniquity but there is a
[1:22:38] god saying hey come on i made a way
[1:22:41] i saw you already make it
[1:22:45] right here this is you i thought of you
[1:22:47] before the foundation of the world
[1:22:49] i saw what you do you just hadn't got to
[1:22:51] it yet
[1:22:52] but oh when that piece comes together
[1:22:55] when that piece snaps together when
[1:22:58] you're putting a puzzle together you're
[1:22:59] missing a few pieces
[1:23:01] in our house or daddy's house that
[1:23:03] happens a lot
[1:23:06] you couldn't find a piece look for the
[1:23:07] piece well we've got all the pieces to
[1:23:09] the puzzle now folks
[1:23:11] every piece of the puzzle is there you
[1:23:13] just gotta find it
[1:23:15] but how happy is it though come on some
[1:23:17] of us older people that still put
[1:23:19] puzzles together some of you don't know
[1:23:20] what i'm talking about because this
[1:23:21] ain't a puzzle
[1:23:24] that's a physical thing called puzzle
[1:23:26] go to hobby lobby and look back in the
[1:23:28] back back then way back in the back
[1:23:30] because nobody ever buys them
[1:23:32] that mall cars
[1:23:34] but you go back there the back
[1:23:36] yeah i used to put them together too
[1:23:38] they're about 20 something dollars now
[1:23:40] we just get them for two or three
[1:23:41] dollars a piece that's horrible anyway
[1:23:43] so you go to hobby lob and you get this

[1:25:13] let me explain the faith of the fathers

[1:25:19] is
[1:25:20] good grief
[1:25:22] if you do know raise your hand up where
[1:25:24] i can see it all right i'm fixing to
[1:25:26] explain it
[1:25:29] all right
[1:25:32] so you've got
[1:25:34] the book of acts
[1:25:36] right here in my hand
[1:25:37] everybody with me
[1:25:39] the book of acts the acts of the
[1:25:41] believers peter james
[1:25:43] paul
[1:25:45] matthias all 12 disciples you've got
[1:25:48] acts the book of acts right here
[1:25:51] in peter's shadow people were healed
[1:25:54] people peter said silver and gold have i
[1:25:55] none but such as i have didn't even
[1:25:56] touch the person
[1:25:59] mighty miracles were all through the
[1:26:01] book of acts and god working in each one
[1:26:04] in in the people and them coming
[1:26:06] together and having church
[1:26:08] and having all things common
[1:26:12] that was the father's
[1:26:14] because what had happened was in malachi
[1:26:16] 3
[1:26:17] there was a restoration
[1:26:20] from the old pentecostal i'd say
[1:26:23] pentecostal the old testament is
[1:26:24] everybody with me here's the old
[1:26:26] testament right here
[1:26:28] all right
[1:26:30] moses
[1:26:31] elijah elisha
[1:26:34] isaiah in the blank have i got that
[1:26:38] all right so they're supposed to be
[1:26:42] turned back
[1:26:45] to the young
[1:26:47] the new church
[1:26:49] john the baptist took him from the old
[1:26:51] testament
[1:26:52] everybody with me took them from the old
[1:26:54] testament
[1:26:56] and turned them to a new way behold the
[1:26:58] lamb of god that takes away the sin of
[1:27:00] the world no more have to go to the you
[1:27:02] don't have to go to the um
[1:27:04] holy of holies you don't have to go to
[1:27:06] one priest here's the man that's going
[1:27:08] to do it and this is a new church being
[1:27:10] built
[1:27:11] how about with me
[1:27:13] but
[1:27:15] then that established a faith
[1:27:19] it was new at the time but they became
[1:27:21] mature they became fathers
[1:27:24] older mature and then down through the
[1:27:26] church ages man started getting involved
[1:27:31] we'll read in just a minute
[1:27:33] man started getting involved and started
[1:27:34] pulling it apart
[1:27:36] they took the faith of the fathers and
[1:27:38] pushed it away
[1:27:42] so malachi 4
[1:27:44] is to turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:27:49] to the children
[1:27:51] everybody with me
[1:27:53] all right and then hearts of the
[1:27:54] children
[1:27:56] which was pentecost which was malachi 4
[1:27:59] two
[1:28:00] now
[1:28:02] we were pentecostal babylon babies
[1:28:05] and god has
[1:28:06] brought us a message to restore the
[1:28:08] faith of the fathers which was back
[1:28:10] there
[1:28:11] everybody with
[1:28:12] me so that was what brother brown's
[1:28:15] message was remember he said this
[1:28:16] messenger malachi 4 do two things
[1:28:18] one according to malachi 4 he will
[1:28:20] restore
[1:28:21] that faith
[1:28:22] let's read it right here let's let
[1:28:23] brother brahm explain it
[1:28:25] go to the jews he was the son of david
[1:28:27] to the greeks he was lord to us he's
[1:28:29] lord to the gentiles and now in the last
[1:28:31] days he would return back as son of man
[1:28:33] because malachi promised that there
[1:28:36] would be a prophet rise up in the last
[1:28:38] days that would return the hearts of
[1:28:40] people
[1:28:40] back to look away from them
[1:28:42] organizations
[1:28:44] back to the original word the faith of
[1:28:46] the fathers in other words what the
[1:28:48] earth what the christendom was founded
[1:28:51] on
[1:28:53] foundation the apostles the prophets
[1:28:54] jesus christ be the chief cornerstone
[1:28:56] never with me and when he did it saint
[1:28:58] john 14 12 the words that he did
[1:29:01] would be done also
[1:29:03] revelations 10 promised the whole
[1:29:06] mystery
[1:29:07] how are you going to reveal the mystery
[1:29:08] see what luther left off see what wesley
[1:29:11] left off see what pentecost left off and
[1:29:14] reveal the secret of the heart to make
[1:29:17] it the same god through every age which
[1:29:20] is nothing but god's word being made
[1:29:22] manifest what back to the son of man
[1:29:25] again
[1:29:27] you've got to restore the faith of the
[1:29:29] father's back
[1:29:30] because they were the ones that most of
[1:29:32] them saw jesus they were under that
[1:29:34] ministry
[1:29:36] they had power
[1:29:42] they weren't cold formal and powerless
[1:29:44] they had the power of god working in
[1:29:46] their life but man has come in
[1:29:49] well let me read right here look
[1:29:52] for there are certain men crept in
[1:29:54] unawares who were before of old ordained
[1:29:56] to this condemnation ungodly men turning
[1:29:59] the grace of our god into lasciviousness
[1:30:01] and denying the only lord god and our
[1:30:03] lord jesus christ they come from the
[1:30:05] faith of the fathers and they started
[1:30:07] saying nope it was a trinity no you need
[1:30:10] to baptize father son holy ghost there
[1:30:11] is an eternal hell there's a purgatory
[1:30:14] there's dead saints you need to pray to
[1:30:16] you see how they're eroding the word of
[1:30:18] god they're tearing apart so they're
[1:30:20] look the word is all powerful but when
[1:30:23] you get in your mind
[1:30:26] listen to me when you get in your mind a
[1:30:28] thought contrary to god it dilutes the
[1:30:31] word of god
[1:30:33] everybody with me
[1:30:35] it turns it into lasciviousness i read
[1:30:36] that to you it turns it into what
[1:30:38] powerless
[1:30:40] but thank god
[1:30:41] he sent a malachi 4.
[1:30:44] he sent one to restore and bring all the
[1:30:47] gifts bring all
[1:30:49] the loose ends all the revelation that
[1:30:51] was lost down through the ages he
[1:30:54] brought us back to the faith of the
[1:30:56] fathers
[1:30:58] amen
[1:30:59] and i can see it i've seen it you've
[1:31:01] seen it we've all seen it in our life
[1:31:04] this message is not
[1:31:06] cold former and powerless i don't care
[1:31:08] if you sit with your arms fold you don't
[1:31:09] say a man one time there's got to be
[1:31:11] something
[1:31:12] inside of you that says amen
[1:31:15] if not then you need to get born again
[1:31:18] because there's a quickening power to
[1:31:20] this message
[1:31:21] there's a quickening power that ought to
[1:31:23] be quicker than you now and you ought to
[1:31:24] be saying ain't nothing but the truth
[1:31:26] ain't nothing but true they ain't
[1:31:27] nothing but truth ain't nothing but
[1:31:28] truth
[1:31:29] and when he did saint john 14 the words
[1:31:31] that he did would you was done also
[1:31:33] revelations 10 promised the whole
[1:31:34] mystery
[1:31:36] how are you going to reveal the mystery
[1:31:37] see what luther left off all right what
[1:31:39] was luther trinitarian
[1:31:42] god can't bless once light comes once
[1:31:45] light comes
[1:31:46] cannot bless a trinitarian doctrine
[1:31:50] everybody with me
[1:31:52] he can wink into their ignorance and say
[1:31:53] well that's man
[1:31:55] but i'm going to have a
[1:31:56] bride over here
[1:32:00] that's gonna be restored
[1:32:02] back past luther
[1:32:04] back over into paul's day
[1:32:06] brother brown said did paul make it
[1:32:08] the angel said yeah he made it he said
[1:32:10] i'll make it because i preach the same
[1:32:12] thing paul priest that identified that
[1:32:14] he brought back the faith of the fathers
[1:32:17] and he preached his heart out but like i
[1:32:19] said before did he change the
[1:32:20] denomination nope they just kept making
[1:32:22] more did he change the people naughty
[1:32:24] kept they just kept
[1:32:27] cutting their hair not coming to church
[1:32:32] until god strikes your heart
[1:32:34] you can't live this message
[1:32:37] until god gives you the new birth
[1:32:39] there's no way you can live this message
[1:32:42] it's a struggle
[1:32:44] but you can live it
[1:32:46] because it's not the message
[1:32:48] it's the bible
[1:32:50] that's what i don't understand people
[1:32:52] will leave this message and they start
[1:32:54] cutting their hair and painting their
[1:32:55] face and drinking beer well listen that
[1:32:58] didn't do away with the bible talk so
[1:32:59] let's say you live holy the bible told
[1:33:02] you to live holy before william brown
[1:33:03] got here
[1:33:05] and a christian back in the faith of the
[1:33:07] father's days you don't have to worry
[1:33:08] about that
[1:33:09] but luther look look how diluted he got
[1:33:12] even luther being a church age messenger
[1:33:14] drink beer mocha pie
[1:33:16] talk about god in a pub
[1:33:19] that's how diluted it got but you know
[1:33:20] what god said i'll take that right now
[1:33:22] because you know what i got to keep
[1:33:23] moving
[1:33:24] i can't skip
[1:33:26] i got to keep moving
[1:33:28] so i moved through luther i moved
[1:33:29] through wesley i moved through pentecost
[1:33:35] guess what he's moving through us right
[1:33:37] now
[1:33:42] your genuine faith will do it right
[1:33:44] there your genuine faith will make it so
[1:33:46] real to you
[1:33:47] look at that woman with the blood issue
[1:33:50] she said if i can only touch the board
[1:33:51] of his garment i'll be made well and as
[1:33:53] soon as she did it she said she felt
[1:33:55] within herself that her blood issue had
[1:33:56] stopped she actually believed it
[1:34:00] and when she touched it to prove that it
[1:34:02] stopped jesus turned around and said who
[1:34:03] touched me
[1:34:06] that perfect face and look
[1:34:09] and that same perfect faith tonight
[1:34:13] tonight
[1:34:15] will touch jesus christ just as it did
[1:34:18] back then
[1:34:20] the woman came with a perfect faith
[1:34:23] for that time
[1:34:25] perfect faith said look now notice
[1:34:26] another perfect faith
[1:34:28] that we were talking about this last
[1:34:29] sunday perfect faith is a master of all
[1:34:32] circumstances
[1:34:33] you heard it brother brown said it this
[1:34:35] morning or this afternoon one he said
[1:34:37] i take every spirit in this room into my
[1:34:39] control
[1:34:42] i can't i'm not gonna do that
[1:34:44] because some of y'all and me brought
[1:34:46] some bad ones in here and i don't want
[1:34:49] but he did but faith masters everything
[1:34:50] because you know what he had a
[1:34:51] commission
[1:34:53] he had an angel
[1:34:55] tell him say get the people to believe
[1:34:57] you
[1:34:58] and said nothing will stand in your way
[1:35:00] not even cancer so if if brother brown
[1:35:02] is looking out and he sees demons
[1:35:04] he's looking at another dimension
[1:35:07] he sees demons he's not scared of them
[1:35:10] he never said from the pulpit well i'm
[1:35:12] not going to deal with that one that
[1:35:14] looks real bad over there
[1:35:16] no
[1:35:18] jesus didn't either
[1:35:21] the disciples were afraid of a couple
[1:35:25] remember
[1:35:26] right oh you can't read that in the
[1:35:28] bible but they couldn't cast that devil
[1:35:30] out so what was the problem
[1:35:32] they were the problem
[1:35:34] jesus said oh that only comes out by
[1:35:37] fasting in prayer
[1:35:39] how many times you heard brother brown
[1:35:41] say okay now he would he would discern
[1:35:43] he would cast out this that this devil
[1:35:45] that devil but remember when he came to
[1:35:47] epilepsy
[1:35:50] watch him when he comes to epilepsy he
[1:35:52] says okay everybody
[1:35:54] bow your head and close your eyes
[1:35:57] why because the eyes is the inlet to the
[1:35:59] soul and when that he said when that
[1:36:01] demon leaves it's going somewhere
[1:36:03] and if you've got your head bound in
[1:36:05] reverence
[1:36:07] you're not gonna get it but if you turn
[1:36:09] the look at it it's coming right towards
[1:36:10] you
[1:36:11] i'm telling you what profit what the
[1:36:12] brother what brother abraham says
[1:36:14] that's what he said but perfect faith
[1:36:17] masters all circumstances jesus never
[1:36:19] got frustrated brother adam got
[1:36:21] frustrated at himself sure enough but
[1:36:22] when he stood in that pulpit
[1:36:24] and he had that commission from god he
[1:36:26] was not nervous
[1:36:28] hey man just like the maniac
[1:36:32] over in wherever the organ or somewhere
[1:36:33] that was going to kill him
[1:36:35] break him apart he said
[1:36:37] he said you'll fall at my feet he didn't
[1:36:39] start stumbling back
[1:36:41] he stood his ground because he knew what
[1:36:42] god would do
[1:36:45] what are you and me going to start doing
[1:36:46] them
[1:36:47] we stumble back at every devil there is
[1:36:49] even the little ones
[1:36:51] when are we going to stand up and say
[1:36:52] look god gave me a promise
[1:36:55] god gave me my kids
[1:36:57] god gave me my husband gave me my wife
[1:36:59] gave me my joy gave me my peace am i
[1:37:02] hitting somebody yet
[1:37:05] that don't have one thing to do with it
[1:37:06] it masters the circumstance in a room of
[1:37:09] sickness the lord revealed that this
[1:37:10] certain thing is going to happen you
[1:37:12] just speak it and go on
[1:37:14] just don't ask any questions
[1:37:16] it's already over just keep going
[1:37:19] then we talked about paul and daniel
[1:37:22] paul when he was
[1:37:24] on that ship
[1:37:27] right
[1:37:28] he was on a ship god told him said you
[1:37:30] got to go to rome now you said you got
[1:37:31] to go to rome so you go into rome
[1:37:33] right
[1:37:34] so god said so
[1:37:36] so he gets on a boat so the boat's going
[1:37:38] into the ocean and all of a sudden this
[1:37:39] big storm comes up well that wasn't god
[1:37:41] that was the devil
[1:37:42] he was trying to disrupt the plan of god
[1:37:44] hello somebody he was trying to disrupt
[1:37:46] your plan of god the plan of god for you
[1:37:48] he was trying to disrupt so he sent this
[1:37:50] big storm but before the storm
[1:37:53] god had a prophet sitting in the boat
[1:37:57] and paul stands up and says hey wait a
[1:37:58] minute
[1:38:00] now look there was 200 and some people
[1:38:02] on the boat
[1:38:03] now think about it this thing this is
[1:38:04] not a this is not a cabin cruiser
[1:38:08] with water and
[1:38:10] a refrigerator and
[1:38:12] no this was just a boat
[1:38:14] a wood boat with 200 and something
[1:38:16] seasoned people on it that knew the
[1:38:18] water knew the waves knew what was going
[1:38:20] on they said we're losing this thing we
[1:38:22] got to get off
[1:38:24] paul stood up and he said look
[1:38:26] if you'll stay on this boat
[1:38:28] we're going to lose the boat
[1:38:30] but we won't lose one person
[1:38:33] if you'll stay right here and boy it was
[1:38:35] hard talk about a renewing of your mind
[1:38:39] everything those sailors had been talked
[1:38:41] was get out of that boat because it's
[1:38:43] fixing to break apart
[1:38:46] get in the lifeboat
[1:38:48] but remember what the captain did the
[1:38:49] captain said okay we're going to believe
[1:38:50] what he said
[1:38:52] he said you cut they were getting rid of
[1:38:54] the lord the lifeboats he said cut them
[1:38:55] things off
[1:38:58] i want somebody a captain to stand up
[1:39:01] one day and tell me say look do what
[1:39:03] that prophet said
[1:39:05] believe what he said
[1:39:07] stand there i don't care i got all these
[1:39:09] issues i got all these things over here
[1:39:12] i don't care
[1:39:14] let's do what the prophet said
[1:39:16] did they lose one
[1:39:18] hmm not a one it was a miracle because
[1:39:20] that thing broke apart 200 and some
[1:39:22] people in the ocean
[1:39:24] said some of them were floating a wood
[1:39:26] some of them probably swam in but you
[1:39:27] know what they started counting them
[1:39:31] do you know they were getting ready to
[1:39:32] kill the prisoners you know that's what
[1:39:34] you do when you have a shipwreck if you
[1:39:35] have prisoners on your
[1:39:38] boat do you know they have these in
[1:39:40] prison now
[1:39:42] they have a gas chamber
[1:39:45] if something happens like an earthquake
[1:39:47] or some disaster they run them in there
[1:39:48] and they gas them and kill them everyone
[1:39:52] yeah there's one in every major prison
[1:39:55] because i mean what if what happened if
[1:39:56] a wall falls down you got 150 to 200 or
[1:39:59] 3 000 murderers running out in the
[1:40:01] street
[1:40:03] but that's what they were going to do
[1:40:04] they were going to keep paul says hold
[1:40:05] it
[1:40:07] believe what i said
[1:40:10] praise god even the prisoners got saved
[1:40:13] hallelujah
[1:40:15] this prisoner got saved
[1:40:20] the devil would have killed you
[1:40:22] he had destroyed you and he's still
[1:40:24] trying to do it but oh i had a prophet
[1:40:26] say no
[1:40:28] stay right there
[1:40:29] stay on my boat
[1:40:31] stay in the message
[1:40:32] believe what i said and you'll be saved
[1:40:36] and they were saved
[1:40:38] all 200 and some of them
[1:40:41] but paul comes up to a place
[1:40:44] and the natives on the on the island
[1:40:48] they're like well this is kind of
[1:40:50] strange
[1:40:52] 200 and some people here they are
[1:40:53] swimming up on our island you know and
[1:40:55] we don't that storm was rough it should
[1:40:57] have killed them everyone no they
[1:40:59] everyone got saved but they started
[1:41:00] taking care of paul they said well
[1:41:03] paul was you know jonah was the problem
[1:41:05] remember
[1:41:07] so they threw him overboard
[1:41:08] so paul must have been the problem the
[1:41:10] bible says that they called said well he
[1:41:12] must be a murderer is because all this
[1:41:14] bad stuff's happening
[1:41:16] you know why the bad stuff happened
[1:41:18] so that the good stuff could happen
[1:41:21] the bad stuff happened so that the good
[1:41:23] stuff can happen
[1:41:24] because here's paul they're calling him
[1:41:26] a devil they're calling him a murderer
[1:41:27] well he he they're going they're going
[1:41:29] to get rid of this guy because he's just
[1:41:30] uh he caused all this because they
[1:41:32] probably rallied around paul and they
[1:41:34] probably were patting him on the back
[1:41:35] saying hey man thank you
[1:41:37] thank you for saving my life i'm gonna
[1:41:39] pat brother branham on the back say look
[1:41:41] not for saving my soul for saving my
[1:41:43] life
[1:41:44] the life that i now live
[1:41:47] paul said i live by the faith of the son
[1:41:48] of god
[1:41:50] here's paul picking up sticks you know
[1:41:51] what
[1:41:52] paul's a servant
[1:41:56] paul didn't sit down on the rock and say
[1:41:58] hey buddy how about going over and
[1:41:59] getting me some wood
[1:42:00] i'm cold
[1:42:02] go over and get me a new car
[1:42:07] go over and get me this no paul went
[1:42:09] over and said i'm cold i think i'll make
[1:42:11] me a fire
[1:42:12] so he starts picking up sticks
[1:42:14] and as he was picking up sticks
[1:42:16] a snake
[1:42:19] and the bible said it latched on to him
[1:42:22] not just bit him it lashed
[1:42:25] well he took that thing and probably
[1:42:26] went like this and looked at it and he
[1:42:28] just slung it out of the way and then mo
[1:42:30] natives are going
[1:42:31] he gonna die now
[1:42:34] god's got our gods that said god's in
[1:42:36] the bible god's glds our gods are now
[1:42:39] going to get revenge on this guy because
[1:42:41] he's such an evil person he's a murderer
[1:42:43] he's this and that the other
[1:42:44] paul throws and slings that thing off
[1:42:46] and
[1:42:47] as i said before the bible and brother
[1:42:49] brown said faith masters all
[1:42:50] circumstances what happened to that
[1:42:52] poison
[1:42:54] within three minutes he should have been
[1:42:56] dead foaming at the mouth and doing all
[1:42:57] this you know
[1:43:00] he goes right on keeps picking up wood
[1:43:04] sets him down builds a fire and the
[1:43:06] natives are going
[1:43:08] well we thought he was a murderer
[1:43:11] now we're gonna make him one of our gods
[1:43:14] so he got elevated from a murderer to a
[1:43:16] god
[1:43:17] but what faith mastered that
[1:43:19] circumstance it turned that water into
[1:43:22] wine
[1:43:22] oh come on it turned that what it turned
[1:43:25] that poison
[1:43:27] into nothing
[1:43:30] faith masters all circumstances daniel
[1:43:32] in the lion's den same way
[1:43:34] brother carl they were getting ready
[1:43:36] we're going to let him down
[1:43:37] because daniel did what he stood
[1:43:40] for the word of god not what man said
[1:43:43] he stood for the word of god and god
[1:43:45] will stand for you those lines must have
[1:43:47] been hungry i bet you about three or
[1:43:48] four days they hadn't fed those lines
[1:43:50] and they were just going
[1:43:54] he's mine
[1:43:56] when they lowered him down
[1:43:58] something overcame the lines
[1:44:01] of faith
[1:44:03] for the time
[1:44:05] that mastered
[1:44:07] listen they weren't just one line in
[1:44:09] there
[1:44:10] they were several
[1:44:12] and they were getting ready to tear this
[1:44:13] guy into pieces
[1:44:15] and the next day
[1:44:17] the old king goes
[1:44:23] daniel
[1:44:26] he wasn't believing he figured daniel
[1:44:28] was already
[1:44:30] chop liver for the lions
[1:44:33] daniel daniel said hey
[1:44:37] these things are really nice
[1:44:39] you ought to have some of these in your
[1:44:41] palace
[1:44:43] they were purring like kittens why
[1:44:45] because he had faith he had faith in
[1:44:47] what god already said
[1:44:49] so when are we going to take the bible
[1:44:51] look faith for divine healing we talked
[1:44:53] about this so we'll go through it a
[1:44:54] little bit faster miracles faith for
[1:44:56] miracles miracle is instant divine
[1:44:58] healing faith could take months
[1:45:00] john ryan it could take weeks it could
[1:45:02] take a long time
[1:45:05] but you got to hold on to faith then we
[1:45:06] got to have a resurrection faith we'll
[1:45:08] talk about these a little bit later and
[1:45:10] we've got to have
[1:45:11] rapturing faith
[1:45:13] all right now look at this god's
[1:45:14] commission to moses watch this
[1:45:17] we've got to have faith for the little
[1:45:18] things first before the great things so
[1:45:21] that's why you got faith down here
[1:45:24] at the bottom to build your house on to
[1:45:27] build your to have a good solid
[1:45:29] foundation believe what god said all
[1:45:32] right everybody with me
[1:45:35] watch this right here james 1 verse 2.
[1:45:37] let's get to this just for a minute
[1:45:39] my brother encountered all joy
[1:45:41] come on james good grief come on man
[1:45:46] count it all joy
[1:45:48] when you fall into many temptations
[1:45:52] how many of us do that
[1:45:58] we don't like to go through trial
[1:46:00] we're human that's our mind over on this
[1:46:02] side
[1:46:03] but god is trying to renew our mind that
[1:46:05] the trying of our faith
[1:46:08] bringeth patience
[1:46:11] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:46:13] faith worketh patience
[1:46:15] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:46:17] that you may be perfect an entire
[1:46:21] wanting nothing
[1:46:24] number 13. let's keep going down through
[1:46:26] a little bit further
[1:46:29] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:46:31] for our brother around this is in the uh
[1:46:34] god hiding himself in simplicity right
[1:46:35] before he preached to seals what he said
[1:46:37] look and faith takes his final resting
[1:46:38] place on the word of god
[1:46:40] nothing else not shifting his sands not
[1:46:43] your opinion not your idea
[1:46:45] faith takes his final resting place on
[1:46:46] the word of god that's why i said before
[1:46:48] i don't want
[1:46:49] i don't want man's ideas i want the word
[1:46:52] of god all right
[1:46:55] but now listen i'm going to say this
[1:46:57] real gentle
[1:46:59] there are people that would take a quote
[1:47:01] from brother branham over the bible
[1:47:06] seen it 100 times
[1:47:10] give me the bible
[1:47:13] this quote will match the bible if you
[1:47:14] got the holy ghost
[1:47:16] if you're a mature christian these will
[1:47:17] match there's never a time when they
[1:47:19] won't match
[1:47:20] if he was a word prophet you got to just
[1:47:24] have patience
[1:47:27] brother brown said if there's a bible
[1:47:29] question
[1:47:30] god will put somebody in the pulpit to
[1:47:31] answer that question for you there's got
[1:47:33] to be a bible answer amen that's where
[1:47:36] it finds this resting place you
[1:47:37] understand its resting place is on
[1:47:41] god's word
[1:47:42] james 2 verse 14 what did it profit my
[1:47:44] brethren do a man say he have faith and
[1:47:47] have not works
[1:47:49] can faith save him
[1:47:51] if a brother or sister be naked and
[1:47:53] destitute of daily food and one of you
[1:47:55] say to them depart in peace now you got
[1:47:57] to watch this scripture i'm going to
[1:47:58] explain it to you you got to watch the
[1:47:59] scripture with james and one of you
[1:48:00] saying to him depart in peace be you
[1:48:02] warmed and filled
[1:48:05] that sounds nice
[1:48:07] but he didn't give him anything
[1:48:10] be you warmed and filled oh you're gonna
[1:48:13] make it
[1:48:15] notwithstanding you gave them not those
[1:48:18] things which are needful to the body
[1:48:21] you just said oh everything will be all
[1:48:23] right just go on everything will be fine
[1:48:25] everything be good go on
[1:48:26] no give me something
[1:48:30] give me something to sustain myself
[1:48:32] give me a preacher and a pulpit
[1:48:34] give me a t-shirt give me a good friend
[1:48:37] a good christian friend that'll give me
[1:48:39] something besides oh everything will be
[1:48:41] all right
[1:48:42] well you why would you woo
[1:48:44] we all got problems
[1:48:47] oh lordy i hope we all don't have
[1:48:49] problems like that
[1:48:51] look and one of them says depart in
[1:48:53] peace be warmed and filled
[1:48:56] joel osteen doesn't preach on sin
[1:48:58] anymore so be you filled your christians
[1:49:01] live a good life
[1:49:02] make lots of money
[1:49:05] give it to me
[1:49:09] so i could be a millionaire
[1:49:10] and buy me a bigger
[1:49:12] plane so i can get to my believers that
[1:49:14] was jesse duplantis
[1:49:17] and you know what people give it to him
[1:49:18] why because there's an anointing there
[1:49:20] they think that they're giving it to god
[1:49:21] when they're really
[1:49:23] giving it to a man
[1:49:25] but right here that says notwithstanding
[1:49:26] you give them not those things which are
[1:49:28] needful to the body what does it profit
[1:49:33] even so faith if it hath not works is
[1:49:36] dead being alone
[1:49:40] yea a man may say now look let me tell
[1:49:42] you something all right you got william
[1:49:44] branham he gets this commission he goes
[1:49:46] out to the world he tells them i got
[1:49:47] this commission
[1:49:48] angel met me in 1947
[1:49:51] the day after uh israel became
[1:49:52] independent he gets it nails it to the
[1:49:54] day
[1:49:56] and he gave me a commission to go into
[1:49:58] the world
[1:50:00] he said you'll be before kings
[1:50:02] potentates
[1:50:03] you'll take this message to the world
[1:50:06] i said you'll have a
[1:50:08] healing ministry i said nothing will
[1:50:10] stand for me in front of you not even
[1:50:12] cancer
[1:50:14] so he declared that right
[1:50:16] now what if that didn't happen but what
[1:50:18] if the first sermon he preached and
[1:50:19] calls the prayer line and nobody gets
[1:50:21] healed
[1:50:26] and he gets scared of that cancer demon
[1:50:28] and he does all the things contrary to
[1:50:30] that testimony that we could consider
[1:50:33] him a false prophet and put him over
[1:50:35] here where he's supposed to be but what
[1:50:37] did god do from the get-go from the gate
[1:50:42] he declares this is my prophet
[1:50:44] this man has divine heat the gift of
[1:50:47] divine healing this man was going to
[1:50:49] tell you how in the world
[1:50:51] listen the people back then they didn't
[1:50:54] have all the uh medical stuff we have
[1:50:57] now with like uh sonograms and and all
[1:50:59] they had was x-ray right
[1:51:03] but now we have mris
[1:51:05] all those different things that can
[1:51:07] splash your body in half what is that
[1:51:08] called
[1:51:10] ct scan
[1:51:11] see if you got any cats
[1:51:15] cat scan
[1:51:17] you didn't have any cats they did find a
[1:51:19] brain though
[1:51:20] okay
[1:51:22] oh it disappeared
[1:51:25] let's pray for sister freedom
[1:51:27] but now look what they have and all
[1:51:29] brother branham was was superficial
[1:51:31] outside
[1:51:32] cancer on them you know you oh i know
[1:51:34] your arm no deep down inside they really
[1:51:37] didn't know
[1:51:38] if an x-ray didn't show it remember he
[1:51:40] said it can hide
[1:51:42] remember many times he said satan you
[1:51:44] thought you could hide this from me
[1:51:46] why brother brown was looking he was a
[1:51:48] ct scan
[1:51:50] he was scanning your body
[1:51:52] one inch after the other and he said oh
[1:51:54] it's on your left breast
[1:51:56] or oh you've got a cancer on your liver
[1:51:58] how in the world
[1:52:00] did he know that
[1:52:02] he was looking at it
[1:52:05] to an x-ray
[1:52:07] he had x-ray vision
[1:52:10] so that built the people's faith
[1:52:14] get the people to believe you
[1:52:18] get the people to believe you
[1:52:22] so he showed
[1:52:25] what faith he had
[1:52:27] by the works that he'd done
[1:52:30] he proved who he was
[1:52:32] i don't care you can say whatever you
[1:52:34] want to about william branham he proved
[1:52:36] who he was in his own tape
[1:52:38] it's on tape
[1:52:40] he proved who he was
[1:52:42] oh he
[1:52:43] he proved who he was
[1:52:45] tell me one time he ever to say he ever
[1:52:47] said on the tape oops i didn't mean to
[1:52:49] say that
[1:52:52] you remember that one time where they
[1:52:53] and they always had the critics you saw
[1:52:55] him on there a minute ago he said i'm up
[1:52:57] against something there was people that
[1:52:59] weren't believing what was going on in
[1:53:00] the service but remember he called that
[1:53:02] woman out he said oh you live at 214
[1:53:04] grove street
[1:53:07] and you're healed
[1:53:09] then later on brother ryan said that man
[1:53:11] said
[1:53:12] she don't live at 214 gross street she
[1:53:14] lives at 417 farrell avenue
[1:53:19] brother brown said well she talked to
[1:53:21] the woman he talked to the woman and a
[1:53:22] woman said well i moved
[1:53:26] just the other day i moved so you know
[1:53:28] what god moved with her
[1:53:32] that man was still over going i don't
[1:53:34] believe but he just showed him
[1:53:37] that he moved she moved she didn't have
[1:53:39] to tell that guy she moved but you know
[1:53:40] what god knew she moved
[1:53:42] and threw a prophet he had he had to
[1:53:44] speak that he couldn't speak that old
[1:53:46] address that's not what she's living at
[1:53:49] so show me thy faith without my works
[1:53:51] and i'll show thee my faith by my works
[1:53:54] thou believers that there is one god
[1:53:56] that does well the devils
[1:53:58] also believe and tremble
[1:54:00] but wilt thou know o vain man that faith
[1:54:03] without works
[1:54:05] is dead if we keep saying i got faith if
[1:54:07] abraham would have said i got faith i
[1:54:09] got faith i got faith and he had died
[1:54:12] with no kids
[1:54:14] he didn't have that faith
[1:54:16] but the works came behind it he said i i
[1:54:18] got faith he said whatever that god says
[1:54:21] that's what's going to happen
[1:54:23] was not abraham our father justified by
[1:54:25] works when he had offered isaac his son
[1:54:27] upon the altar
[1:54:29] see us thou have faith wrought with his
[1:54:31] works and see by works was faith made
[1:54:34] perfect and the scripture was fulfilled
[1:54:37] which said abraham believed god and it
[1:54:38] was imputed unto him for righteousness
[1:54:40] and he was called the friend of god
[1:54:43] listen folks we're not the friend of god
[1:54:48] abraham was a friend of god because he's
[1:54:49] not a son of god
[1:54:51] hello
[1:54:53] he was not born again you and i are the
[1:54:54] children of god we're not friends of god
[1:54:57] we're the children of god if you're born
[1:54:59] again you're a child and son and
[1:55:00] daughter of god abraham doesn't have
[1:55:02] that title
[1:55:05] you do
[1:55:07] you see then how that by works a man is
[1:55:09] justified and not by faith only
[1:55:12] likewise also was not rahab the heart
[1:55:14] that justified by works when she had
[1:55:16] received the messengers and sent them
[1:55:18] out another way
[1:55:19] for as the body without the spirit is
[1:55:21] dead so faith without works is dead
[1:55:26] also
[1:55:27] listen to this we'll be done right here
[1:55:29] john expressed his faith in what god had
[1:55:31] revealed to him
[1:55:32] therefore works is faith testimony watch
[1:55:35] this
[1:55:36] when they see you acting like you're
[1:55:38] healed then you'll know you've got faith
[1:55:40] that you are healed
[1:55:43] what does testimony say saying this i
[1:55:46] have it now
[1:55:47] because i received god's promise it is
[1:55:50] now working in me
[1:55:52] i am making ready for it to happen
[1:55:56] uh-huh see that's what you t your works
[1:55:59] does well sure
[1:56:01] now listen there's only two channels
[1:56:02] that you can live by one's faith and the
[1:56:04] other one's unbelief we've talked about
[1:56:05] that this morning smoking drinking
[1:56:07] commitment adultery lying stealing
[1:56:08] carnal impersonations those things are
[1:56:10] attributes of unbelief
[1:56:12] if you was a believer you wouldn't do
[1:56:14] those things no you do that because
[1:56:17] you're not a believer
[1:56:19] but by your fruits you'll be known your
[1:56:20] actions speak louder than what your
[1:56:22] confession proves
[1:56:24] hello somebody
[1:56:25] when you disbelieve god's word and count
[1:56:27] it as something gone by that's why i
[1:56:29] said before first time people get in
[1:56:31] trouble
[1:56:33] what do you do leave church
[1:56:36] that's contrary to god's word he cannot
[1:56:38] give you a problem there's no promise in
[1:56:39] the bible that says if you run away from
[1:56:40] god he'll come looking for you
[1:56:44] he said if you draw nine to me
[1:56:46] i'll draw nine to you
[1:56:49] this is just as good as that it goes to
[1:56:51] show you're not a believer that's right
[1:56:53] you're not
[1:56:54] and if you was then you would believe
[1:56:56] god's word
[1:56:57] he would express himself he would
[1:56:59] express himself through his word now he
[1:57:02] was god's word expressed
[1:57:05] now if you can't believe me believe the
[1:57:06] words that i do search the scriptures
[1:57:08] for them them you have eternal life
[1:57:09] that's the very thing that will tell you
[1:57:11] who i am
[1:57:12] now let me get this real quick and then
[1:57:13] we'll close right here musicians get
[1:57:14] ready to come and let me take a little
[1:57:16] further will you
[1:57:18] the scriptures is what tells what you
[1:57:20] are
[1:57:24] even if you're a sinner the scripture
[1:57:25] tells you who you are
[1:57:27] that expresses you and expresses me the
[1:57:31] scriptures tell what we are
[1:57:33] it's so loud that our voice cannot even
[1:57:36] be heard
[1:57:38] our life speaks louder than our voice
[1:57:42] and it's god's way of letting us see
[1:57:44] what we are
[1:57:46] it's god's way of letting us see what we
[1:57:49] are let me read one more musicians come
[1:57:51] on
[1:57:52] we know jesus lives in a world of
[1:57:53] perfect faith i want to read this right
[1:57:55] here though
[1:58:04] talk about on the chart there's two
[1:58:05] elements you know that you possess in
[1:58:07] one of the other
[1:58:10] let's stand our feet
[1:58:22] what a beautiful picture of faith faith
[1:58:24] knows no defeat
[1:58:26] faith is perfect
[1:58:27] faith brings things when there is no
[1:58:29] things to be brought
[1:58:31] faith creates
[1:58:32] faith takes doubt away
[1:58:34] faith takes negative and makes it
[1:58:37] positive
[1:58:38] how beautiful
[1:58:39] the old man had a basis he's talking
[1:58:41] about you know he's talking about simeon
[1:58:42] remember simeon the lord spoke to simeon
[1:58:44] and said you'll not die until you see
[1:58:46] the lord's christ how many of us believe
[1:58:48] that we're not going to die until we see
[1:58:49] a body change all right well we need to
[1:58:50] start confessing that doesn't matter how
[1:58:52] old you get
[1:58:54] because simeon was an old man
[1:58:57] he had a basis for faith faith is not
[1:58:59] mythical something mentally worked up
[1:59:02] it's an absolute fundamental result that
[1:59:04] happens in a person's heart that could
[1:59:06] have been said no better
[1:59:08] when faith is appropriated then it is
[1:59:11] something in the person's heart but it
[1:59:13] can't be based on well go touch a tree
[1:59:15] you'll get well or pray to the post it's
[1:59:18] got to have a foundation now here it is
[1:59:20] i want you to get it how much more
[1:59:22] foundation could you place your faith on
[1:59:24] any level
[1:59:26] than the word of god
[1:59:28] what more could you put faith in when he
[1:59:30] said heaven and earth will pass away
[1:59:32] but my word
[1:59:34] shall not or never
[1:59:36] pass away wow
[1:59:39] faith does the rest of it faith does the
[1:59:41] rest so you must have faith for a
[1:59:42] foundation all christianity all that you
[1:59:45] are all that you ever will be is based
[1:59:48] on faith in the word of god
[1:59:50] that's the reason i believe
[1:59:52] the word
[1:59:53] first you must be born again
[1:59:56] and then add
[1:59:58] to your faith god bless you
