[0:00] I'm going to teach a little lesson here
[0:02] this morning continuing where he left
[0:03] off last time but I want to kind of
[0:07] focus on love
[0:09] this morning and
[0:11] I just like to stay right in there with
[0:13] what's being taught to us you know
[0:15] brother
[0:16] Waits uh teaching the statue perfect man
[0:19] and I just want to stay right on that
[0:20] study because I don't want to get
[0:22] everybody distracted with other topics
[0:25] and things and also brother Bob's been
[0:28] on the subject of faith
[0:30] so
[0:33] my key focus is I love to love and I
[0:36] hate to Hate that's I'm all about love I
[0:38] love to love people and when it comes
[0:39] down to where I have a choice when I
[0:41] face adversity with someone I try to
[0:43] overlook that you take make a lot of
[0:46] examples like road rage you know you
[0:48] think well I could I could rage back a
[0:50] little bit when somebody does something
[0:51] to me on the road but you know otherwise
[0:53] I could say well I don't think they
[0:54] meant to do that I can Overlook that
[0:56] maybe that was an oversight they didn't
[0:57] mean to do that and just try to be
[0:59] forgiving and loving the people and I
[1:01] just that's the way I love to be just
[1:03] take an attitude of love and just as a
[1:06] choice you can choose to love or you can
[1:08] choose to be hateful toward people it's
[1:10] a choice we have when it comes to loving
[1:13] our other people and Brothers and
[1:14] Sisters in Christ especially
[1:17] um the bride I believe should be experts
[1:19] on the subject of love
[1:21] I don't claim to be an expert on it I'm
[1:23] a student I'm a student on the word of
[1:25] God I'm a student on everything I do I'm
[1:27] a student truck driver I'm a student
[1:28] pilot I'm a student parent and student
[1:30] father I'm trying to constantly better
[1:32] myself and and pray and ask the Lord to
[1:34] help me to be better at all that I do so
[1:36] I'm not claiming to be an expert on this
[1:38] but I just want to bring out some things
[1:39] that I hope will be supportive and
[1:41] helpful in the subject you notice I put
[1:44] there part one because I'm sure I won't
[1:46] finish today so maybe we'll have a
[1:48] continuation of this later
[1:51] I'm going to go and open in prayer just
[1:53] for the lesson here Heavenly follower
[1:55] Pride you just bless us as we study on
[1:56] the subject of love and help us just to
[1:59] understand a little bit more about you
[2:00] and your love especially the agape love
[2:02] that we need to know so much about Lord
[2:04] is brother Wade stands here ministering
[2:06] to us on that Lord help us to just open
[2:07] our hearts and open our minds to receive
[2:09] that and more understanding
[2:11] and a field of Love Too Lord we just
[2:13] want to know all about you and that
[2:15] great love that you've made for us and
[2:16] we give you the glory for it and thank
[2:18] you in Jesus name amen
[2:20] so just to review the last lesson
[2:23] um I was talking about the Statue of
[2:25] perfect man and all these virtues and
[2:27] the life of the Lord himself it's not
[2:29] hard to study in his life and see on
[2:31] display all these virtues
[2:33] uh really um as you notice there that
[2:36] top left picture him as a boy with the
[2:38] doctors that I think scripture calls
[2:40] them doctors that means just like
[2:41] basically the teachers He was discussing
[2:45] the word with them at a very young age
[2:46] and asking them questions he was all
[2:48] about the father's business from a very
[2:50] young age and then there's those silent
[2:52] years when uh he comes to this 29 and a
[2:55] half becoming 30 the Bible says he comes
[2:57] to be baptized and be anointed for his
[2:59] ministry there was a growth development
[3:01] in that silent year period and he was
[3:03] evidently reading the Scrolls going to
[3:06] the temple the Bible says that was his
[3:07] custom you know to go to the to the
[3:09] synagogue and on the Sabbath into and
[3:12] just and to read the word of God
[3:14] so we know during those years there was
[3:17] some growth development he was growing
[3:18] in Grace and knowledge and then he came
[3:20] to the stage where he had all these
[3:22] virtues on display in his life and it's
[3:24] like I said it's not hard to see that
[3:28] I'm going to try to go a little bit
[3:29] slower today because I know I'm gonna
[3:30] finish all of it so I'm going to try to
[3:32] slow down a notch
[3:34] so
[3:37] he was all about the father's business
[3:39] uh and then
[3:42] as you see he comes to the end of his
[3:44] life especially there on Calvary that
[3:46] was the embodiment of this what we're
[3:48] talking about love that's agape love
[3:50] such a strong display of it that he was
[3:53] there on Calvary and being mocked and
[3:56] his beard being torn out and he's being
[3:58] spit on and ridiculed and all and and
[4:01] being laid there open and naked and bare
[4:03] and shame for us and that he still
[4:06] displayed all this love even for the
[4:08] ones who were mocking him he was dying
[4:10] for the sins of the world what a display
[4:12] of agape love it couldn't couldn't
[4:14] possibly be a greater display of love
[4:16] than that
[4:20] so what I want to say is
[4:22] I'm back up here before I get to that I
[4:25] like to look for examples okay
[4:28] um and I know that these things were on
[4:30] display in the life of our Lord and they
[4:32] should certainly be on display in the
[4:33] bride but you're not going to see
[4:35] Billboards you're not going to see big
[4:37] flashy signs you know God is in the
[4:39] little things that's why I loved like
[4:41] sister Rebecca durrette's testimonies in
[4:43] sister Beverly they talk about they
[4:45] testify about God and the little things
[4:47] in their lives and don't overlook those
[4:50] little things because God's in all those
[4:51] little things
[4:53] now look at the virtues in your life and
[4:56] in the lives of others in the bride of
[4:57] Christ and you can see these things on
[4:59] display I want to give some examples
[5:02] um just some little things I've noticed
[5:04] you're gonna think Ryan that's not
[5:05] really virtue that's not really
[5:07] godliness well yeah yeah it is if you
[5:09] really think about it it's on display
[5:10] it's in full View and it should be it's
[5:13] not a far off it's not across the sea of
[5:15] the word of God is neither in my mouth
[5:17] and in my heart and it's manifesting
[5:19] it's a Living Word manifesting his
[5:21] attributes these virtues of the stature
[5:24] perfect man so it's here okay just be
[5:27] attentive and focus on what is going on
[5:29] around us in your life and in the life
[5:31] of other people
[5:33] okay
[5:35] um I came here from the Baptist Church
[5:37] at 17 and immediately I noticed a huge
[5:40] difference okay not condemning them in
[5:42] the Baptist Church they don't know any
[5:43] better about the ladies some of them you
[5:45] know where they would wear makeup and
[5:46] cut their hair and wear pant suits and
[5:48] even shorts and t-shirts men and women
[5:49] both just kind of you know not really
[5:52] dressing holy and living holy in that
[5:54] way because they didn't know any better
[5:55] but I came here and I noticed the first
[5:57] thing you Godly sisters the way you
[5:59] dressed I said man that's I already had
[6:02] in mind what I wanted to marry that God
[6:04] had dealt with me about you know when I
[6:06] get married someday I should look for a
[6:08] girl that would be willing to put Christ
[6:10] in marriage that was my my ambition
[6:12] because the youth pastor at the Baptist
[6:14] Church told me that look for someone who
[6:16] would read the Bible and prayer with you
[6:17] and go to church with you and you too
[6:18] would love the Lord together serve the
[6:20] Lord together put Christ in marriage and
[6:22] then I came here and I said wow I need
[6:24] to do that but also I need to look for
[6:25] one of those Godly saintly holy dressed
[6:28] Christian ladies Holy Ghost filled with
[6:30] the long dresses and you know not clingy
[6:33] form-fitting clothes and no blouses and
[6:36] things like that nothing provocative
[6:38] because being a boy at that age 17 a lot
[6:41] of hormones I didn't like to be around
[6:43] people that would be a source for
[6:45] Temptation for me okay so you sisters
[6:48] were the reason and I chose to marry
[6:50] Gabby I would look at the lives of
[6:53] life's sister June for example I could
[6:55] name a lot of names here I had a lot of
[6:57] people in mind and I said God give me
[6:59] another June give me another Peggy Dell
[7:00] another Lisa Dell another Anna all the
[7:03] Anna's we've got lots of Anna's but so
[7:05] many examples here that I said God I
[7:07] want one of those
[7:08] wholly dressed and and that's the way
[7:10] Gabby was when I met her but that was an
[7:12] example to me of all this godliness
[7:15] that's godliness where the white spent
[7:17] sermons many sermons talking about that
[7:19] godliness is already here we already
[7:21] have godliness and sometimes we take it
[7:23] for granted we don't realize we're
[7:25] already living Godly lives if you
[7:26] compare us to the world it's easy to see
[7:30] we chose to name our fourth child Abba
[7:33] um when Gabby had conceived her I
[7:35] remember praying with her one night and
[7:37] I said well I I opened my eyes from the
[7:39] parent I said I believe I we want I want
[7:41] to name her June her middle name June
[7:43] not just after sister June that she's a
[7:45] special lady to me to Gabby to many
[7:47] people here because she's so kind and
[7:48] loving and all that she's a very special
[7:50] lady and that's why I chose that her and
[7:52] brother Wade like my message to parents
[7:54] that I didn't have
[7:55] because I didn't my parents didn't come
[7:57] in the message but aside from that it's
[8:00] representative of all you sisters
[8:01] because I knew through that what to look
[8:03] for in a wife through y'all's example of
[8:06] godliness I knew through that that's why
[8:09] I chose Gabby Now look for example
[8:12] brother the kindness charity and
[8:14] selflessness that's a big part of all
[8:16] this we're talking about love selfless
[8:18] brother the way you've been on the
[8:19] subject of selflessness that's a hard
[8:22] thing
[8:23] okay
[8:24] remember that God hides himself and
[8:26] reveals himself in simplicity
[8:30] one of the main examples I'm going to
[8:31] give here is
[8:33] uh for many years I've gone back and
[8:36] reminisced over mining Gabby's wedding
[8:37] day and I looked at the pictures of her
[8:39] but I didn't really notice in the
[8:40] background I mentioned this certain
[8:42] young lady last time when I taught my
[8:43] lesson about these Dutch perfect man and
[8:46] I remember that this certain young lady
[8:49] was uh kind of she liked me okay just
[8:52] being blunt I met a certain girl
[8:54] Kentucky girl in 2005. I met her at the
[8:57] Alabama Camp she liked me but I didn't
[8:59] like her that way I wanted to be friends
[9:00] well she continued like me and it wound
[9:03] up it's just one of them hard things as
[9:04] a teenager we all go through that where
[9:06] you like someone but they don't like you
[9:07] back and that's hard but she's over it
[9:10] she's happily married now Godly
[9:12] Christian man she married they have a
[9:14] beautiful family but I never had noticed
[9:16] until 15 years later I looked back the
[9:18] other day at this picture and I saw in
[9:20] the background this certain young girl
[9:21] and what you notice her doing there is a
[9:23] display of Brotherly sisterly kindness
[9:26] despite that she liked me and wanted to
[9:29] marry me she was going to let me marry
[9:31] Gabby and stay back out of the way and
[9:34] and actually help Gabby on her wedding
[9:36] day to prevent a possible embarrassment
[9:38] that Runner that goes down the aisle her
[9:40] dress that got snagged on that and she
[9:43] was going to walk down the aisle
[9:44] dragging that thing behind her possibly
[9:47] and embarrass herself you know that's a
[9:50] real display of Brotherly kindness as
[9:52] little as that looks yet think about
[9:54] what was going on in her mind that she
[9:56] wanted to marry me and yet here's this
[9:58] other girl brother Branham said when you
[10:01] love someone right you could let them
[10:03] marry someone else and you just step
[10:05] yourself up by the wayside and said I'd
[10:06] rather you be happy you know that was a
[10:09] display of that that was the display
[10:10] brother sisterly kindness she just
[10:13] stepped all the way and said I'm
[10:14] actually going to help Gabby have a good
[10:16] wedding and a good life and go on and
[10:18] I'm going to get out of the way selfless
[10:20] so selfless
[10:22] Godly little girl
[10:26] so brother Dale is another example
[10:28] think of our pastor brother Dale stood
[10:31] Faithfully for many years ministering
[10:33] the word of God for our benefit and our
[10:35] other ministers have done likewise
[10:37] how many times have we heard brother
[10:39] Dale stand up here and say I would that
[10:41] I would be happy to see y'all make it in
[10:43] the Rapture and me just go by the
[10:45] wayside me just stand off and be happy
[10:47] to know that I had some something to do
[10:49] with it but yet you all make it and if I
[10:51] don't even make it he would say I'll be
[10:53] happy just to see y'all make it what
[10:55] selflessness and to set himself aside
[10:57] and stay and pray for for us not for his
[11:00] benefit I know ministers do benefit from
[11:02] it too but you know they're doing it for
[11:05] us they're stepping aside of all the fun
[11:08] they could have they go out and instead
[11:10] of going out and having fun on the
[11:11] weekends they sit and study and pray and
[11:12] see God for a sermon or whatever or a
[11:15] lesson and that's selflessness that's
[11:18] them that's godliness and kindness and
[11:20] brotherly kindness you know on display
[11:24] uh no she doesn't want me to mention
[11:25] this probably but a couple Sundays ago
[11:28] sister Regina had a little birthday
[11:29] party for me and my family
[11:31] got us a cake came back there in our
[11:33] little room we're not in we're not out
[11:35] here in the main room where everybody
[11:36] was seeing that so she wasn't doing it
[11:37] to be noticed she wasn't doing it for
[11:40] notoriety or recognition but now she's
[11:42] getting it is it for Regina she came in
[11:45] there and had a birthday party for me
[11:46] and my family got us a cake and cards
[11:48] and all that and she came in there and
[11:49] she just wish sung us happy birthday
[11:51] just to celebrate us and I was like Wow
[11:53] brotherly kindness
[11:55] totally selfless
[11:57] not thinking of her own self
[12:01] I gotta make a distinction here too
[12:03] right up front um I want to say that I'm
[12:05] comparing back and forth during this
[12:07] lesson on
[12:08] uh agape love and Philo love but make
[12:11] the distinction that they are very
[12:13] separate agape love is very infinitely
[12:16] higher than filial love okay it's so
[12:19] much higher but yet I guess it'd be okay
[12:21] as I said to say I'm a student so I'm
[12:23] going to word it this way that maybe you
[12:24] should say God let that condescend that
[12:27] great agape love kindness into a form of
[12:29] philia where we could begin to
[12:31] understand something about agape love
[12:33] because how it's cool we understand
[12:35] something so great
[12:36] so Luke 14 If any man coming to me hate
[12:39] not his father and mother and wife
[12:41] children and Brethren and sisters and
[12:43] even his own life he cannot be my
[12:44] disciple the Lord telling us to hate our
[12:47] brother and sister something don't sound
[12:48] right go down to that other uh big print
[12:51] verse 33 so likewise whosoever he be of
[12:54] you the forsaketh not all that he hath
[12:56] he cannot be my disciple
[12:59] so he's kind of clarifying what he said
[13:00] there at the top at the beginning of
[13:02] that verse
[13:04] hate is if you look at the definition
[13:06] there Strong's definition at the bottom
[13:08] it's in bold print
[13:10] he means love less so our love for God
[13:13] should be infinitely higher than our
[13:14] love for spouse children friends family
[13:16] and even one another it should be so
[13:18] much higher that it's as if it were hate
[13:20] okay big big difference likewise there's
[13:23] a big difference between agape and
[13:25] filial love so I don't want to come
[13:27] across like I'm saying they're wanting
[13:29] the same they're definitely not but
[13:32] uh let's see for some reason the
[13:34] highlights didn't show up on here so I
[13:35] don't know which part I'm supposed to
[13:36] read but anyway Ephesians 5 why submit
[13:38] yourselves to your husband as unto the
[13:40] Lord for the husband is the head of the
[13:42] wife even as Christ is the head of the
[13:43] church so you see here Paul making the
[13:45] comparison of marriage and filio love
[13:48] marriage love as a comparison to Christ
[13:51] in the church that's kind of what I'm
[13:53] doing here back and forth several times
[13:55] through here husbands of your wife even
[13:57] as Christ I love the church so he's
[13:58] making that comparison philio and Agape
[14:01] we can understand a little bit more
[14:03] about agape
[14:05] just by our natural relationships
[14:07] between husband and wife parents and
[14:10] children and brother and sister in
[14:12] Christ and just friends and with people
[14:15] you can kind of begin to see the in a
[14:18] much lesser form this great Agape Love
[14:21] on display
[14:22] because Agape Love is a great thing and
[14:24] it's really infinitely beyond our
[14:26] understanding if God doesn't bring it
[14:28] down somehow to where we can grip it or
[14:30] we can kind of have a tangible example
[14:33] of it here
[14:35] so skip a numbers 29 for no man ever yet
[14:38] hated his own flesh but nourisheth and
[14:40] cherished that even as the Lord the
[14:42] church for we are members of his body
[14:44] and flesh of his bone for this cause
[14:46] shall a man leave his father mother and
[14:48] shall cleave and shall be joined to his
[14:50] wife and they too shall be one flesh
[14:52] this is a great mystery but I speak
[14:54] concerning Christ and the church
[14:57] okay
[14:59] so faith and love two tremendous
[15:01] subjects I can't think of anything
[15:03] greater than faith and love to talk
[15:04] about and yet at the same time
[15:07] simultaneously our brother Wade brother
[15:10] Bob in Sunday school now talking about
[15:11] faith brother waveman is now talking
[15:13] about the status of man brother kindness
[15:15] and and love getting into this great two
[15:18] subject at the same time so it's a
[15:20] tremendous thing I mean it's a really a
[15:22] sacred Holy Ground we're standing on
[15:23] right now with them talking about these
[15:25] things simultaneously some we should
[15:27] really meditate on
[15:29] and with their backgrounds both being in
[15:31] uh brother Bob you think of Colossians 1
[15:34] 26 he loves that scripture and by the
[15:36] way it is real uh particular to Genesis
[15:38] 1 26 and 27 when you think about Genesis
[15:42] 1 26 and God said let us make man in our
[15:44] image after our likeness let them have
[15:45] to mean of the fish of the sea and of
[15:47] the foul of the air and over the cattle
[15:49] over all the Earth and over every
[15:51] creeping land of creepeth upon the Earth
[15:52] so God created man his own image image
[15:54] of God created him female created them
[15:57] that's our you could say our theophany
[16:00] that's our
[16:01] eternal life that was in God for the
[16:03] foundation of the world that he brought
[16:04] down to this Spirit man that we're
[16:07] coming back to it's what we bypassed but
[16:09] that's agape love and here is brother
[16:11] white talking about love standing here
[16:14] and uh and I'm sure he's going to be
[16:16] talking more about it as we go and
[16:18] brother Bob about
[16:20] this scripture calls from 126 and
[16:22] especially verse 27 to him God will make
[16:24] known what is the riches of the glory in
[16:26] this mystery among the Gentiles which is
[16:28] Christ in you the hope of glory faith
[16:31] what great faith and brother Brown
[16:33] talked about I don't think I have to
[16:35] quote too much later I won't get to it
[16:36] today
[16:37] fall in love with the Lord first I've
[16:40] got a whole bunch of slides probably
[16:41] from the next lesson about first falling
[16:43] in love with the Lord the most important
[16:45] thing you can do really fall in love not
[16:47] just say I want to stay out of hell I'm
[16:49] just trying to dodge hell but no really
[16:51] fall in love with Lord first
[16:52] and then it'll start you in this baby
[16:55] form of love this baby form of faith of
[16:57] believing that'll just keep going and
[16:59] growing from Faith to Faith from
[17:01] Revelation to Revelation from love to
[17:04] love you'll be loving the Lord more all
[17:06] the time as you go through your journey
[17:08] about start off with love
[17:10] just giving a little depiction here I
[17:12] think that's how brother Wade said it
[17:13] the other day these first four okay
[17:15] virtue knowledge temperature patients
[17:17] are kind of all inward dealing with us
[17:19] you know individually and with our own
[17:21] self but then godliness is more upward
[17:23] and then I believe he quoted that uh
[17:25] brotherly kindness and love are outward
[17:28] that's the hard part that's toward our
[17:29] fellow man
[17:31] that's the part that's kind of hard to
[17:33] to get a hold of but it's it's
[17:35] attainable okay I'm not saying it's out
[17:37] of a reach again it's attainable we can
[17:39] get it and we even see it already on
[17:41] display
[17:42] so much just really be a attentive and
[17:45] watch around you
[17:46] faith is the greatest expression I can
[17:49] think of just for an example of how
[17:51] great the faith of Jesus Christ himself
[17:53] is would be the universe and creation
[17:56] I'll talk about that in a minute of
[17:58] course the love already said the
[18:00] greatest display of that was I believe
[18:01] Calvary
[18:03] I crossed with that for our sins this is
[18:05] a picture I think of the Andromeda
[18:06] galaxy I love to talk about space
[18:08] because I see in that God and His
[18:10] vastness and how vast and great creation
[18:12] is and What Faith Can Do with this man
[18:14] Jesus Christ that would speak his word
[18:17] first think it then he would speak it
[18:19] and then believe it makes his great word
[18:21] with his great faith this infinite uh on
[18:24] this boundless faith and will create a
[18:27] universe
[18:28] that we don't think about much how vast
[18:30] it really is the Andromeda galaxy is our
[18:33] close end neighbor 2.3 million light
[18:36] years away so if he was to go the speed
[18:38] of light for 2.3 million years you'd
[18:41] reach our neighbor
[18:42] Galaxy that's close in
[18:45] that's the closest one
[18:46] well anyway they think that our galaxy
[18:49] The Milky Way looks something like that
[18:51] they don't know because they can't send
[18:53] a probe out there it's too far to go out
[18:55] there it would take millions of years to
[18:57] get out there and look if he was to
[18:59] cross from one side of this galaxy of
[19:03] ours to the other they estimate it to be
[19:05] a hundred thousand light years across
[19:06] you'd have to go the speed of light for
[19:09] 100 000 years to get from one side to
[19:11] the other that's our galaxy that's not
[19:13] the universe that's our galaxy
[19:15] that's our little bit of Galaxy that's
[19:17] not even our solar system that's just
[19:18] our galaxy now you think about all the
[19:20] other galaxies out there and they can't
[19:22] find it into it and the god that made
[19:24] all that spoke it and believed it with
[19:27] his own faith
[19:29] tremendous faith
[19:33] and now he had to bring that Faith down
[19:35] to this simple form of childlike faith
[19:37] I'm not in here later I don't know if we
[19:39] get to it today I think it's on one of
[19:41] my next slides I'll hold that for a
[19:42] minute I don't know much about human
[19:44] anatomy I'm not an expert on this uh
[19:46] notice Ruth knows about this other
[19:49] nurses but
[19:51] human anatomy is a fascinating thing and
[19:54] I just think it's incredible to think
[19:56] about the human body the god that spoke
[19:58] his word and believed his word could
[20:00] create this complex very impressive
[20:03] machine of the human body and even one
[20:06] blood cell is not just a blob it's a
[20:08] complex machine within itself with all
[20:10] these little intricate little Parts you
[20:12] take any system of the body of the
[20:14] intestines the lungs the cardiovascular
[20:16] system the skeletal system anyhow it's
[20:18] just absolutely incredible and God spoke
[20:22] that he thought in his mind he spoke it
[20:24] and believed it and even said I want to
[20:25] be that he said I want to be part of
[20:27] that he's it's god making himself flesh
[20:30] but it's all this display of his faith
[20:33] and then here again we have this display
[20:34] of love
[20:39] my slides got out of order so a
[20:42] condescension of God brought connotation
[20:43] of his attributes okay Matthew 18 at the
[20:47] same time
[20:48] came the disciples unto Jesus saying who
[20:51] is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
[20:52] and Jesus called little child unto him
[20:55] not one of the doctors not one of the
[20:56] Pharisees he called a little child and
[20:58] set him in the midst of them and he said
[21:00] verily outstand to you except you be
[21:01] converted and become as a little child
[21:04] ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of
[21:06] Heaven whosoever therefore shall humble
[21:08] himself as this little child the same as
[21:11] the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven
[21:12] you know a child just believes what
[21:14] they're told they don't have any reason
[21:16] really to doubt you they don't I mean
[21:18] they just they don't worry you know uh
[21:21] sister and brother Chris and sister
[21:23] Jesse's they got those three little
[21:25] girls they don't get up every morning
[21:26] and wonder how I'm gonna have a meal
[21:28] today I wonder if we want to have
[21:29] somewhere to sleep tonight no they just
[21:31] believe they just don't worry they have
[21:33] all this great love and this great
[21:35] childlike faith that they just love
[21:37] Mommy and Daddy they have confidence in
[21:39] Mommy and Daddy and they believe Mommy
[21:40] and Daddy and they trust mommy and daddy
[21:42] and that's how we approach our dad our
[21:45] heavenly father with that great love and
[21:47] faith it's just simple childlike love
[21:50] and faith
[21:51] part of our daily devotion times the
[21:53] Lord should include meditation on him
[21:55] and his worth he's revealed to us
[21:57] meditation on his word coupled with
[21:59] prayer and singing praises to Him will
[22:01] cause us to fall more in love with him
[22:04] now I'm going to try to talk a little
[22:05] bit about this
[22:07] um as just for a minute as we kind of
[22:09] transition this other side and I've been
[22:10] to onagape all right change your gears
[22:13] getting on the field of love you know if
[22:15] you have agape love if you have the love
[22:16] of God in your heart it kind of spills
[22:18] over into other areas of your life and
[22:21] in your marriage and in your love with
[22:22] your children and it's sort of you're a
[22:24] student of this great
[22:26] god of love you're a student of his and
[22:28] you're learning love and and as a way
[22:31] you can you know spend time with God and
[22:34] and love him more and more as you go on
[22:36] your journey likewise with your spouse
[22:38] it's also an effective method in
[22:40] marriage think about your spouse
[22:41] sometimes you stay while singing you
[22:43] don't have to do the love songs okay I
[22:45] know some people may not want to sing
[22:45] Love Song but think about your wedding
[22:47] song think about main thing is just
[22:49] meditate and think about the good things
[22:51] the good qualities of your spouse and
[22:53] that enhances Your Love You musicians
[22:55] can go ahead and come please
[22:57] think about when the two of you first
[22:59] fell in love your first date your first
[23:00] meeting in life Etc never lose that
[23:02] first love you had never leave that
[23:05] sweetheart stage
[23:06] Bank of brother and sister Tatum I plan
[23:08] to mention that next time about brother
[23:10] sister Tatum and many other examples
[23:11] brother and sister Dale people have been
[23:13] sweethearts in their marriage for
[23:15] decades and set the example for us of
[23:17] how it's supposed to be done when you
[23:19] put Christ in marriage and really have
[23:22] real love for each other and that starts
[23:24] in kind of a seed form and just keeps
[23:26] growing because you work on it because
[23:28] you cultivate it because you think about
[23:31] the good qualities of your spouse and
[23:33] don't think about all those that last
[23:35] argument argument you had or how you're
[23:37] gonna you know when you get home from
[23:39] work that day how you're gonna you know
[23:41] set her straight or set him straight or
[23:43] whatever that's what brother Dale used
[23:45] to say something about that and he he'd
[23:47] think about something maybe all day get
[23:49] home and she's made him a banana pudding
[23:51] or something and kind of calmed things
[23:52] down a little bit changes the atmosphere
[23:55] so anyway that's all I want to say for
[23:57] now I'm gonna close with that God bless
[23:59] y'all thank you
[24:07] [Music]
