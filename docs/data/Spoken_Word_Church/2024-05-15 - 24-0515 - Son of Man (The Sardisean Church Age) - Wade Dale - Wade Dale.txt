wonderful um this weekend and being Mother's Day we uh appreciate all you mothers and I hope you got your gifts if you didn't see sister June if you weren't here Sunday and uh we sure enjoyed the uh the message I I sent brother Bob a text right before service and I said how's it going he said well brother Aaron's preaching my sermon I don't have anything to preach I said I feel the same way you do the same thing to me so don't be angry with him so um good to be in the house of the Lord good to be back uh we had a wonderful time in Ohio they said to tell you hello and uh greetings in the name of the lord they're uh um they're doing well they've got some uh things they are working on but what did I read to y'all brother R said a church without uh a little bit of uh heartache is not a church so we sure U appreciate them and we love them with the love of the Lord and we all are there to uh to help them so uh I think we're running out of screen here um so I don't know what's going on Josh come here help me this for a minute all this new stuff what do we doing here I don't want ink I don't want to be inking so what I need to do I don't want that either put that I've been tapping it say by now oh I'm on you left me on I want to read something to you real quick while you're standing and it's really interesting because uh if you've been watching any of the news that U Joe Biden is getting ready to cut off a little bit of help to Israel this is not the first time he done that in 1982 monum Bean which was the Prime Minister of Israel came to visit Washington and young Joe Biden Senator Joe Biden at the time they had invaded Libya are in Lebanon and they were you know they were defending their country and it kind of got heated because then Biden told him said well we're just going to we're just going to cut you off cut off your uh support this is what monin Bean said he said so I'm not a Jew with trembling knees we didn't ask for your help at The Six Day War we haven't asked your help when they killed six million of us in oswit and all the different places in Germany so we don't need to ask for your help now go Israel go Israel the only the only thing that's keeping us afloat is that we are giving Aid to Israel CU remember the Bible says whoever blesses Israel will be blessed well when we start cutting off Aid then guess what folks it's getting close and that's what Joe Biden wanted to do in ' 82 and that's what Joe Biden's wanted to do now so uh um but do you think the Jews care I don't think they do they appreciate it I think they appreciate the help they appreciate the technology but I think they've got their a little of their own I kind of like their way of doing things they they don't even ask forgiveness later they just do it they don't have to go go to the United Nations and the security Council and ask no they just go and do it but we know that God's with those people over there there's got to be a country of Israel a state of Israel there's got to be a place where the 144,000 has got to be taught and preached to and and able to hear the gospel and and they'll be there and I believe they're there now like I said before so um just something that was that came up I was watching brother Ron Spencer and he was reading it and he was kind of chuckling a little bit about it that uh you know they don't need our help they don't need our help they they're doing fine theirself so remember there's coming Sunday second service will be worship service uh June the 2nd as brother Ryan said Brother Richard Wilson will be here we'll have a regular service and then an ordination service right after that and then we'll have a meal and fellowship after that as far as I know his whole church is coming that can come so most of his family and the and some of the church members are all coming for the weekend then remember uh July 19th through 21st if you remember last year we went to um went to Brother Andre's and uh we stayed in the motel we're trying to look for airbnbs and places how many of you now not binding but just raise your hand if you're thinking about going just if you're thinking about going raise your hand 12 all right remember 12 and and I don't think we're going to have a service here I think we're going to stream from there and and then uh just not have a service here so we can all be up there we'd love for you to go we'll do the best we can to help you like I said before we're trying to find big Airbnb airbnbs where we can stay you know a lot of people can stay together and we don't have to go to uh uh we had to go all the way to Johnson City to stay last time and uh and that was a little bit of a travel time but just uh if you want to come I'll announce this again Sunday and I'll put a thing downstairs that that uh we sure wish all of you you would go and we'll help you the best way we can to get there all right I have one quote I have given God one million reasons to hate me and he still hadn't changed his mind about me praise God I don't know who that quote came from but it's a good one I've given God a million reasons to hate me and he still hasn't changed his mind about me cuz remember God can't change his mind amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus thank you for this time that we have to meet in the middle of the week father I pray that You' be with us now in the furth of this service bless the word as it goes forth Lord may it just Unite with our let be as brother Brown said soul to soul let your soul come down lord and and Unite with the people in your word Lord and I pray You' heal the sick Lord we have many that are out today that are at home Lord watching in I pray that you'd right now that you'd touch them Father and may they feel the anointing power of the Holy Ghost anoint them Lord to be healed in the name of the Lord Jesus father just forgive us of our sins and just be a help in time of trouble in Jesus name we pray amen we're going to talk a little bit about the sard sardian church age now we're in church age number uh five we got six and seven to go so we're getting close but the Ser s Ean Church age let's read Revelations 1:10 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day heard behind me a great voice as it was a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest write in a book and send it to these seven churches which we're going to look at here in just a minute go through some of them again but he turned to see the voice and what he turned he saw an image he saw an image of a man it was the son of man but he was in Bride form and that's what we're looking at today is is is there is no place cuz we're going to get to something in just a few minutes there's no place God is like he is in his bride now God's God God's good as I told them up there in the in Ohio I said God's grace is sufficient but there ain't no gree in it there ain't no gree in Grace no you don't slide by all right but we do believe in grace and the grace of God gave us seven Messengers that brought seven messages that we can look back and and it can I hope it's helping you it's helping me to even study this about some of the ones that have come up during that time and the people it was the people in that age folks you had one messenger but then you had the people that had to accept that message and there was a people there that accepted it just like now there's a people here to accept the message in the end time and in the midst of that seven candles state was one liking to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PPS up here with a golden gird you may be seated Lord has his Blessing to the reading of the word let's look re read Revelations 3:1 and the angel of the church in Sardis now this is a sardian church age we know who the messenger was he was one of the most popular Messengers and his name was Martin Luther and he is the father or founder of the Reformation all right remember they were reformers all right they were not restorers they were reformers all right but they had a they had a part to play these things sayith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest now here he goes back to works again we're going to talk about back up a minute for the church age before that thou Hast a name that thou livest and are dead we'll get to that Sunday Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect see there's a group of people that comes out of that other Church age into this church age that have works but they're not perfect right in other words what's going to happen is first three Church ages you didn't have a lot of different ideas but they were coming in but once you get into that middle Church age man that's when Rome took over that's when you had to do what they said that's when it was called the Inquisition it was called the Dark Ages it was called all these different things the Crusades everything was wound around the Catholic church and the people against the Catholic Church all right so coming out of that Luther didn't take those things and he didn't throw them out he brought some with him so God's telling him said hey I know your works but I got somewhat against you because what you're doing you got a name that you're living but you're dead and you're not perfect before God but now remember in this church age folks we have to be perfect our works have to be perfect everything has to be perfect everybody with me oh I can't do that well you need to find somewhere you can cuz the Bible says that we need to be be be therefore perfect and that a five-fold Ministry was given for thee what perfecting of the Saints remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief Thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in SST which have not defile their garments and they shall walk with me and white for they're worthy praise God there's always in every Church there's a worthy group of people all right just like you just like you they sit and listen to a message and they accepted that message they Liv that message and then they passed on and they're waiting on me and you to get them out of the ground praise the Lord for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath a near let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches now we've come to the church age now we got one two and three which was under the lion anointing the middle age is the what the ox we'll get back to it in just a second now the next AG the next two ages and we're going to see this was the man anointing or the intelligence anointing of I I was looking up a few minutes ago you see that sardian church age lasted from 1520 to 1750 that's probably one of the greatest ages of man putting things together number one the printing press was made and that just changed everything you had to have no scribes anymore you could put the print and press and you could sit there and print all the paper you wanted to print not like what we do today but it was the beginning of what we do today all right so it was very important to have the pr and press because that's where these Bibles come from all right so that was one thing and then there was some other things that they did during that time which shows the man anointing or the intelligence of man we know the intelligence of man out there is killing us but there's an intelligence of God of knowledge in the church in the Statue of perfect man that's good for us all right and Martin Luther had the knowledge that the just shall live by faith and someone grabbed that knowledge and took that knowledge and went on through the whole church age without him being there the whole time just like we saw with Columba all right so this is the the ox age we're getting out of into the man and then remember the last one is the eagle anointing and that's what we're going to get to maybe in a few weeks and I really want to get to that because I want to cover a lot of things that that um I just put this in your mind um each one of these Church AE Messengers had a message right distinct message Paul arenus Martin Columba Luther Wesley and then Pentecost and then the prophet of God but remember he had a two-fold message these others didn't all right the reformers definitely didn't they were just trying to reform people and watch the re watch the Reformation it was bringing it or a protesting of the Catholic church that's why Martin Luther is so important because he stood up one day and said hey we're not going to do this anymore 900 years Rome had ruled and finally one man that come out of their system God put him right in the middle of their system and he walked out and said nope we ain't doing that no more the Bible says the just shall live by the faith of God not no venience not Penance and all these different things so praise God we had a anointing but now in the end time brother random had two messages messages to bring why he said he did right he will read it in the church age book messenger Malachi 4 does two things what turn the hearts of the children back to he's got to turn us back to the faith of the fathers right there he's got to turn us back to the I say religion but he's got to turn us back to the doctrine of the pure doctrine of the first church age because it got eroded eroded got almost blacked out Rome took over uh Martin you know he pulled a little out Luther pulled a little out Wesley pulled a little out but they left Loose Ends they left things back over here like there's a name that you're called but you're dead what a father son Holy Ghost baptism that God Winks at their ignorance but it was dead took a prophet to tell us that was dead to restore all those things back so we'll get to that in a in a little bit where brother randam does those two things and you can see it distinctly in his message where he does does it and how he does it all right so now let's read the previous age and to the angel of the Church of thy high right these things sayith the Son of God who ha his eyes like into flame of fire and his feet like fing brass I Know Thy Works in charity as we were talking about last Sunday or Sunday before Wednesday before I Know Thy Works in charity now listen God knows cuz he set this whole thing up all right he put the man on on the scene so he's the one that's doing this he's the one that's writing this actually this should all be in red cuz remember God is telling this to John to write down all right I Know Thy Works in charity and service in faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel in other words they didn't do away with her right they suffered her in other words they kind of said oh I'm going to turn my head for a little Prestige which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed un Idols unto idols and I gave her space to repent everywhere you see God gives him a space to repent and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and then that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent here we go again except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death that's what we were talking about last time death coming out of death and we'll look up look at another little point I missed in just a few minutes and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the Reigns in heart I will give unto every one of you according to your works all right but unto you I say and to the rest in th as many as have not this Doctrine praise God somebody's not going to take the doctrine of bam and the doctrine of Jezebel they're going to be separated group we're going to out the doctrines of this message and be a SE well praise God it doesn't it happens anyway as many as have not this Doctrine in which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden but that which you already have hold fast till I come listen whatever you got tonight hold fast to it until he comes and gives you some more hold to what you got if it Ain a thread hang on to that thread if it's a notot if it's the end of a rope TI knot and hang on cuz listen we as Believers we've got to start believing that's what God said that's it believing and doing remember faith without works is dead you say I got all Faith you can say I got all works well let's put them together let's let our faith work and he overcometh and keepeth my words now here here we go to my words unto the end to him will I give power over the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessel of a Potter shall they be broken to Shivers he even as I received of my father and this is Jesus talking and I will give him the Morning Star he that hath in ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches now remember the th Ty just for a background the tharan church age was the longest it was 606 to 1520 900 years years of Rome ruling the world now remember she's going to be killed with death but it's not going to be the death that you and I are thinking about in other words if somebody passes on we don't see him anymore until the resurrection right well these demons didn't die they just hid that's right when Luther and Wesley started reforming the church those the Roman Catholic Church never died it got stronger that's right it started harboring all the gold it started buying churches it started buying property that's when it began listen when God moves Satan moves but Satan can't move till God lets him and God allowed that church 900 years to take over and a false Doctrine killed 68 million Christians for 900 years that's why this is the ox age or the ox anointing it's the labor you're not going to win a race with an ox but you sure can plow a garden with it amen got some horsepower so that's what it was in that that church age they had horsepower and the Bible even tells us that the last is going to be better than the first now this is where you and I are going to get a rebuke in just a minute we did the the other day but I want you to really look at it they were stronger in and after their persecution than they were in the beginning now listen that's almost humanly impossible I said it's humanly impossible for you to say pour it on Lord I ain't had enough no as soon as we get a toothache we go stop the program amen but they got stronger they held closer together toward the end that's what you and I have got to do we got to hold together stronger toward the end if not some's not going to make it and it all comes down to another thing called a dominating female and we know that female dominated really from the first church age all the way into this church age right here it just came from Diana into this one is in this church age and then it culminates with the hor inter children all right in this church age all right but it also means continual sacrifice you and I need that Ox anointing just to get up in the morning to go to work just to make it through the day and listen they made it through right so we got to put that state down like we like many of you did during the baptismal service last year Drive I mean drive it down I've driven one down I got to drive some more I can't just get one great big one I got have a bunch of little ones but drive it down and go on we can't go backwards this church AE did not go backwards even though they said I'm a Christian and they got put in the line's Den we've not been through that before the messenger was Columba he was born in 521 and died in 597 and he was born in the country of Ireland right there where brother George Quinn lives and dony go so let's look I Know Thy Works in charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy Works listen there's nothing wrong with works if it has Faith to build on top of I I tell you as I said before many examples you've seen them and I've seen them you get somebody that wants to do everything give me a list brother I'll paint your house ain't none of y'all ever done that I'll paint your house I'll wash your car right this church is really strange you know I think about this the other day but uh you know when we always go out and eat usually you buy the preacher food usually that's the way it works in other churches people buy the preacher food well in this church brother Dell's always bought your food hello right it is amen just but that's just the way he is and that's all right but don't try to work yourself into it don't say well now brother wait I I and I'll let you I got a lot of things I go over and sit with Dad for today for like four hours in the house and it's just beautiful outside and I got a hundred things I need to do but we're taking care of him first but if you want to come pressure wash my house pressure wash pile somewhere underneath that two car garage that ain't a car ever been in I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and they said it twice so listen works is not bad but like I said Works has to have a purpose besides trying to work your way into heaven cu the Bible tells us in Revelations that those that are standing before the white Throne judgment have to be what judged by their works if you're a born again Christian today you don't have to stand because you're not judged by your Works you're judged by Christ Works what he did for you at the cross that's the whole thing that's going to keep you out of that amen so get born again work on that don't work on other stuff work on getting born again if you never show up in my house to do nothing get born again I'm not laughing get born again it's hard enough not being born again we've all lived that hello we weren't all born born again born born again we were born dead right notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calls herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants my servants she's in the church that Jezebel system and it's still there now right and it could be here if we don't drive that thing out right amen which calleth herself a propheus now she didn't call herself a at that time hello she called herself a prophet prophetess and in this age we're going to see that there was a prophetess that sat on a three-leg stool and prophesied a three-leg stool kind of strange and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and eat things sacrificed into Idols I give her space to repent and she repented not I give her space he gave Jezebel space to repent right he gave Cain a space to repent he gave Judas a place to repent he gave Adolf Hitler somewhere in Adolf Hitler's life God came to him and he didn't he turned it down if not then he's just not a perfect God he's a perfect God he knows what he's doing he he he's not a respector of persons at one point in time in your life he thought no more of you than did off Adolf Hitler except for that part in his mind that back part in the vision part when he saw you before the foundation of the world now that is eternal that never had a beginning that never had an end that never had an account we had an account hello we had an account until we got born again we had an account cuz you know what you weren't no count that's right people in know how may don't understand that language but you weren't no count we weren't behold I will cast her into a bed and then to commit an adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death that's kind of a strange statement that we talked about the other day I will kill her children with death usually if you kill something it dies but he says I'm going to kill her children with death usually you kill it with a gun or you kill it with a run over it or you kill it with a bat or you kill it with something he's going to kill he's GNA kill the children with death we'll read that in just a minute and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns in the hearts and I will give to every one of you according to what your Works listen your Works does matter amen that's right like that brother said he says are we Standing on the Promises or sitting on the pr one of the two but unto you I say un to the rest in thra as many as have not this Doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak look I will put no burden there's there's a group of people here again that God has Sanctified to hold their self to keep their self and God's not going to put no more on you than you can stand you think oh no I don't believe that listen has God ever made a mistake I told him up here in Ohio I said and and this is a a kind of a carnal analogy but check your boxes right be practical for a minute check your boxes God's mad at me or I don't have any Liberty and I don't check your boxes do I love the Lord do I study more than I used to do I go to church more than I used to that's all important that's part of the Box do I pay TI the way I'm supposed to I mean come on you the little things ain't it the little things what bothers you the big thing sometimes like like Bob's got a great big they've got a great big um uh how many people how many how many did you say how many lawyers was down there good G and you got one born- again believer sitting right in the middle of it 600 lawyers he's got a burden amen he's got a burden because what happens is all that see they do works and they do it under something else come on they're working every day to get money from other people right but brother Bob's kind of in there trying to make sure everything runs good well he has wor but his wor is going to take him somewhere and so is theirs so wor is not bad it's just how you do it who you do it for check your boxes do you ask God before you do something seek ye first the kingdom of heaven there's a box there somewhere so if you're having trouble check your boxes make sure everything's fine Brother Brown said look didn't he say he said when you've done everything you know to do listen everything you know to do is in here when you do everything you know to do what brother R say do he said stand right there stand right there there and he said watch God work then Abraham tried for 25 years to have a child and when he finally got to a place he said Lord you going to have to do it cuz I can't God changed his body and he did it all right that's what's going to happen to me and you I think we're trying to figure this thing out and sometimes we don't figure it out very well that's me included so we see this church age but that which you have already hold fast till I come other words if you got a little bit hang on to it and he that overcometh and keepeth now look my works now what's God's Works versus ours this is God's Works our works has to coincide with that but we have sometimes we have works that are outside of that I'm preaching to myself I guess so the ox age is the age of Works James 2:1 17 said even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone right because Martin Luther were getting it we're setting it up for the next Church age what what is his his his his whole statement is the just shall live by works no works alone won't do it works alone is what Martin Luther did like in that movie when he was trying to do Penance he was crawling on the rocks and he was trying to beat himself and and do all that Penance that's works but he had no faith but now that God got a hold of him and gave him the New Birth come on somebody he saw that those Works were not the right ones but now now now the just shall live by the faith of God and the works will follow and listen it's not stuck in that church age it's right here tonight the just shall live by faith if so faith if had not works is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou Hast faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show you my faith by my works for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works now look you want me to you want me to put to put a scripture to that and explain that a little bit more Paul said you can have all the faith in the world Amen you know the mystery right huh right and not have what love to go with that Faith you put that faith and love together then something's going to happen so Faith then without work is dead also if you pull them apart right I think sometimes we have more faith than Google then we do in God right and how many times have you said it let's Google that or I Googled that or I looked it up why do we have to look up something you know I and don't get me wrong I like to watch other obviously I watch brother Ron Spencer and different ones and I watch the services and I'll do a little bit roundabout but if you sat there for three hours and watch James Dobson talk about how to be good faith without works you got to have faith in what somebody else said not what he said you got to have faith in what brother Brown God sent us a prophet to have faith in that man God sent us a five-fold Ministry to have faith in besides some man out there amen I'd rather sit you know all those great ones and I'm not they had their time they had their time Dwight Moody different ones I love and we're going to be able to sit down and talk to them cuz listen they were bride too but to take their message listen and I'm sorry but to take their message it's it's old carrying that's right it's left over people in this message eat a lot of dead carrying they can't get here because they stuck back there right waiting on signs and wonders and waiting on this and waiting on that the only person you better wait on is the Lord they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength not anybody else all right here again we find the same introduction introductory marks I know that works the Son of God himself believe me for the very Works sake he put an emphasis on his own Works while on Earth The Works that he did were ordained of God look to inspire faith in him brother brand the angel said brother BR get the people to believe you what is belief Faith have faith in you he said nothing will stand in your way not even cancer but it inspired faith in the people he said he'd say many times he said oh faith is building what this one was believing that one was believing this one was believing they getting out of their denominational ideas or they were waking up to what he was saying and then they had faith in what he done it was a great part of his ministry talking about Jesus so was it brother brandham his Holy Spirit and the Apostle Paul said for we are his workmen ship workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath ordained that we should walk in them what the good works that he has Ephesians 2:10 these Works were to inspire faith in him as they would show forth that relationship to him that Paul described as created in him now works will never take the place of faith in God for our Salvation all right everybody with me but works will show forth our faith already placed in him right good works won't save you but they will come forth out of a saved life as fruit unto the Lord I believe in good works even if a man is not saved he ought to do good works and do the best he can what is horrible in the sight of God though is for men to do evil works and then they say they're doing the will of God and that's what's happening in this church age the Roman Catholic Church are standing and we'll get to it we won't get to it tonight maybe but man in this next age in the age of Luther's age there was a transition and it came there all these were uh you know how the Catholic says that Mary was was resurrected number one she's the mother of God she was resurrected and she ascended she ascended just like Jesus did so according to the Catholic Church all right well we're going to see in this NE in this age those seeds that are being planted because it started with a mother child worship and ended up and took child out and it was just a mother right so they exalt Mary though and don't exalt Jesus Christ Satan's slick but he's not as slick as a prophet he's not as slick as a prophet and he's not as slick as a prophetic people you and I are prophetic people we should have prophetic insight as brother Ram said we should be able to know these Mysteries and know listen and know what to do with them there's your words don't have just don't just have Fai faith in this message don't get quiet don't just have faith have Works to show it they're working theirself to death out there to get nowhere dead but they work work work work work trying to work their way into heaven some of them may get there because they're going to have to stand before the wi throne and give a account of their works but you're going to a group of people though that we'll get to in the last Church age and I'll read it where there's a people that stands up and says have I not cast out devils in your name have I not done these Great Mighty works in your name and God's going to say depart from you I never knew you now that's going to be strange for you to understand I know we do understand it but it's kind of hard to comprehend that you can have a man up here and he can be casting out Devils right and left by the hand of God cuz Satan can't cast out Satan but him be just as black on the inside and go to hell wow and that's what we get into because anointing ones at the end time in this verse he is commending his children because they were living changed lives their Works testified to a new spirit within and Ruth's not here tonight just Ruth but God bless her and I hope Robbie watches this but I told her I said you know what or his sister sitting right here so she knows what I'm talking about I'll promise you when God gets a hold of that guy everybody will know it everybody will know it but that was the same way with a lot of us everybody knew when God got a hold of us I hope so I hope you've changed but Robbie's got it coming he'll never see this but he's got it coming cuz he's had the blood applied to him his wife drove a state down and she wants him as a husband that's born again sitting beside how many of us want that to happen in all our lives we want our kids sitting here we want our parents sitting here we want our brothers and sisters sitting here my word if people that had come to church here will come back to church here we will have to build on that's how Wayward that we've seen them leave well now let's see them come back this is the end time well listen put your faith to work right amen put your faith to work all they're getting worse and worse so so your face got to be stronger at the end than it is at the beginning in this verse he's commenting his CH commending his children because they are living changed lives their Works testified to a new spirit within men saw their good works and glorified God yes sir if you are a Christian you are going to do what is right your Works will show that where your that your heart is right and it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will when no one but God sees you and you will do his will even if it cost you your life that's right how many of you has that resolve amen if it cost you listen this life is worth nothing kids we love we love I love life as much as the next person does but everything we touch is dead right exactly but if you'll get changed you'll see that your life will help other people change amen that's why we're here we're not here to be selfish what Brother D tell he said I know I got the new birth he said but first thing I want to do is give it away I want to give it you can't give yours away but you sure can't shine a light bright enough to where they'll see it cuz we'll see it in just a minute where the Bible says if that light in you be Darkness how great is that Darkness how deceptive it is that you're sitting in a church and you're dead as a Hammer Brother Ry priest works his faith expressed I know that works and the last to be more than the first now look this is certainly remarkable is what we're talking about as the darkness of the age increased now listen this age is going to Black completely out it's not going to get any better there's not a worldwide Revival for the Bride As far as building big churches and having big members that's right said fear not little flock this is certainly remarkable why is it remarkable like I said before Lord my tooth hurts I need two to I need two of my teeth to hurt y'all prayed that before hadn't you no well that's what it's saying they were more strong over here to end than they were to beginning and they looked back and saw 68 million of their brothers and sisters in the grave right but yet they became stronger and stronger and stronger what in their faith they worked all the harder as the darkness of the age increased as the honor role of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased now listen they weren't required to come to a body change you and I are required to take what we have right now today what you have today and take it to a body change that's our requirement so we better get into this attitude that it's going to get worse but it's going to be better when we get toward the end of this thing amen they worked all the harder they served all the more their faith increased how tragic it was that in the Ephesian Church age love Wayne and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in all the other Church ages but in this age in the darkest of all ages they served him even more what a lesson that is there's no ceasing of this gracious service of Love unto the Lord but rather an increasing of it that is the secret now you want to know the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is increase service amen amen when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to shout the victory let's get that in our mind um brother uh Perry and them saying I what I'll praise you when it's all wonderful and my bed's wonderful and my and I got this great pillow and and I got a brand new Sleep Number bed and my number is the right number it's like 777 and now the song says I'll praise you in the storm I will lift my hands do we do that this age was trained to do that and we get a piece of this age folks it was the same holy ghost that that took them through that Ox age is sitting in you tonight all right let's go a little bit further I want to give you a warning right here he says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold and to lay out to see in her last age self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day Spirit it is time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will fill the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us us reject the very thing that's able to help us amen Wow Let's don't get caught in that trap let's Praise Him in the storm whatever you're going through lift up your hands and praise him so now we see that the dominating female which is a church it started in Ephesus with Diana we covered that this th tyan age is a prophetess it SATs on a three-legged stool and prophesies and then our age it ends up with the great wh and her daughter so somewhere between all this it continues with the worship of a woman all right everybody with me all right like I said before brother randam he he he said he said you know you can have all the beard joints and a bad woman or or or a prostitute she'll send more people to hell then all these beard joints will now that's hard to understand but it's not cuz the Bible says you look on them now if you look on a woman to lust after you committ adultery with her already in your heart huh hello look on her to lust after her you've already committed adultery with her I'm just telling listen I Think Jesus said that that wasn't a brother Rand quote that was a Jesus quote everybody with me notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrific the idols unto idols and I give her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not listen he gave them 900 years under the ministry of Columba he gave them 900 years to repent and turn around and go another way didn't happen that's right and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her so there must be a widespread thing it's not just going to be an individual one little thing no it's going to be widespread commit adulter with her into Great Tribulation except they repent now there you go repent of their deeds repentance can go a long way if y'all don't know that Godly sorrow leaded us to leads us to repentance if you're really sorry for what you did there's only one thing you can't be forgiven for and that's blaspheming the Holy Ghost one thing I know we I know you can name all those other ones but I'm just telling you brother rown said the only thing that keep you out of Heaven is blaspheming the Holy Ghost I ain't saying bride and I ain't saying this or that he just said blaspheming the Holy Ghost is the only thing that keep you out everybody with me on that all right so let's just don't be too hard to judge every once in a while I know it's bad you have to pay your you have to pay your Penance you're not going to get away with it like I said God's grace is not greasy you can't slide around or under it but you will have to give an account and you will have that thing sitting on your shoulder all the time you will God won't but you will that's a paradox that you're a child of God you're growing in the Statue of perfect man and that thing that that that you did 25 years ago when you were out in the world it sits right there and reminds you of what you did what what did Brother R say do he said just remind the devil where he's going all right cuz remember he's the only one that sees it God doesn't see it do we really believe that amen do really believe that the blood's sufficient that that it cleanses us from all unrighteousness that it that we're going to be a Chase virgin that we're going to be presented to God without spot or wrinkle now how's that going to happen that's having faith in what God's already done and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he that searches the reign of heart and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works 1 Timothy 5:6 but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth let's don't be that way if you're not born again you're dead you can have all the whoop whoop up you know like brother B said that woman said boy this is life and drunk as a skunk and half clothes on she thought that was life when it was what it was death it was Kill her she just didn't know that think about a woman though here's a prophet standing in a motel room I mean a motel hallway and here's this woman goes comes crawling out she probably was away from her husband like she like you said and she was having a good time and she was probably at a convention or something and here she comes out of the room with half her clothes off with a bottle in her hand drunk as a skunk and said whoopee this is life and looks right into the face of a prophet and doesn't realize it never changed her one bit she was so into what she was doing never changed her one bit those beady eyes of that Prophet looked at her and I he probably wanted to condemn her but he probably prayed for her he probably walked in his room got on his knees and said God forgive that woman and and prayed for her do we do that or we kick them over the balcony and hope they don't land too soft what will be the punishment of the Harlot and her children well it's going to be twofold first he said I will cast her into a bed according to the last part of verse 22 it will be a bed of tribulation or Great Tribulation that is exactly what Jesus said in Matthew 25 1-3 because remember the 10 virgins five are wise and five are foolish those five foolish virgins they go through the tribulation period they're they're cleansed there they're not cleansed here you and I praise God we're cleansed here we're not cleansed there don't wait on something kids adults don't wait on something there were 10 virgins five were wise five were foolish the five wise had oil the Holy Spirit but the other five did not now remember they were virgins they went to church they served the Lord they did the best they could for what they had amen they weren't there's a there's one of them out there but these were 10 virgins Five Wives five foolish when the cry went out behold the bridegroom cometh the five foolish had run seek oil while the five five wise virgins went into the marriage the five that remained outside were left to the Great Tribulation that is what will happen to all who do not go in the Rapture that is what will come upon the Harlot and her daughters secondly it said that he will kill them with death or as a literal translation says let them be put to death with death this is a strange saying we might say let a man be put to death by hanging or by electrocution or some other way but this says let them be put to death by death death itself is the cause of their death if that light and you be Darkness how great is that Darkness I say here but I say the denominations they have no light they're trying some of them are trying the best they can and they're going to be part of the foolish virgin or they're going to be part even part of the hor system but giving eternal life because of their words of being to the bride and all that let's don't chance that let's don't chance that uh the lady Cuts our hair today she was uh talking about where the Bible says there the way the tree leans that's the way it's going to fall it don't change directions when you pass away brother Bram said if you're honor here You' be honor there now I want you see this clearly so I will take our illustration again of the daughter of Jezebel marrying into the house of Judah and thereby bring it right into idolatry and causing God to deliver Judah to death did you did you know that read your story even one of uh Jezebel's Sons can't remember his name but I think he's in here I put it in here she had him go do something and it just destroyed everything she listened to her mama oh I right I was preaching it this weekend on uh Mother's Day about how a mother are good and then that mother was bad and remember who was the one that that that caused her daughter to dance in front of Herod so that she could have John the Baptist head cut off she caused her daughter to do that told her daughter to do that Jezebel told her son to do that so there's some bad ones in there too that is what balum did too so here was Jezebel with her paganism over there's Judah properly worshiping God and living under the word so Jezebel marries her daughter to jehoram that's him jehoram the minute that happened jehoram caused the people to become idolators the minute that marriage took place Judah was dead that's why a mother can be the most nurturing and greatest thing but she can also remember what remember what Solomon said about a woman scorned or a brawling woman it was better to live with a cow on top of the house than it is with a brawling woman he ought to know he had a thousand wives and a thousand mother-in-laws the minute that marriage took place Judah was dead spiritual death came in listen spiritual death we ought to talk more about that because it's unseen to the common eye hello somebody regular death is pretty good I mean not good but it's common if somebody passes away you go to the funeral home you see them you close the casket you say a few words put them in the ground you don't see him anymore spiritual death you see him every single day and it gets worse and worse if that light and you be Darkness how great is that Darkness there's many people come on people that scripture that Jesus was referring to is message Believers right let me just put that stamp on and that's message Believers have I not cast out devils in your name have I not preached your word have I not done Mighty works in your name amen wow the minute the First Church of Rome organized it died the minute that the Lutheran organized have you seen again what in the world they're doing with the Methodist Church Heavenly days they're taking the Lord's Prayer out of everything now the ones that have the Gaze and all that stuff on in their pull pin they're taking that out of their whatever they say or their books cuz it's not inclusive it don't include all them other people the minute that the Lutheran organized death came in and they died the Pentecostals came along last and they organized now this is where he made a lot of people mad cuz those Pentecostals were sitting there in that service that's right the spirit left though they don't believe it but he did that marriage brought death then the light of the Oneness of the godhead came he's talking about now his message hello they organized and they died too then after the fire of God fell on the Ohio River in 33 a healing Revival swept the world but it never came through an organization remember it was apart from God went outside the Pentecostal group outside of organization and what he's doing what he's going to do in the future is going to be outside organization God can't work through the dead he can only work through the living members those living members are outside of Babylon so you see death or organization came and the church died or to make it pler death became the a resident what's a resident Bo when they renters move into your house now they're not all demons I know that's what you're thinking but they reside there okay cuz that's where they live death became a resident wherein shortly before only life had rained as the original Eve brought death to mankind so now organization has brought death for organization is the product of the double corruptors nism and bism propagated by Jezebel there's your Trinity what nician ISM bism Jezebel ISM Now Eve should have been burned along with a serpent for her awful deed but Adam intervened taking her quickly to himself so that she was saved but when this satanic religion has gone to the full course of the ages he's talking about now there will be no one to intervene and she will be burned with her Seducer for the and her children and the Antichrist and Satan will all find their places in the lake of fire Matthew 6: 21 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also the Light of the body is the eye if therefore thine ey be eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light wow but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness how great is that Darkness right if you think you're doing right and it be what wrong and you think I've got God I've got Jesus I've got this I've got that I I believe in a trinity I believe I'm talking about out there I father son Holy Ghost baptism oh yeah hell's Eternal no yeah oh yeah hell's Eternal all these different things that they go by that's dead there's nothing quickening you can't Quicken false word so as they you to carry false word there's no quickening power anywhere in it right I I hate it for those people but if they accept that system they become a part of it and if we accept this message and just accept it like it is we're just a part of it are we saying what's set on tape are we just repeating what's set on tape that's what brother jaldo was saying I love that so under the law let's look here real quick under the law he that smiteth a man so that he die shall be surely put to death period all right he that smileth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death Bob you're you're um every how many floors in your building it'd be empty because of this cuz there was no lawyer that's going now wait a minute um did they really do that or were they aiming at somebody else that hit this guy no if you smite your mother and father you will be put to death he that curses his father and mother we're getting slammed now shall surely be put to death you shall keep the Sabbath for it's holy everyone that defileth it shall be put to death remember there was a guy that forgot to get his firewood is everybody with me under the law if you picked up a stick on the Sabbath day they took you out and stoned you there was no court of appeal right cuz that man did he was picking up sticks and they took him out and killed him now that's death everyone that defileth it shall surely be put to death for whosoever doeth any work therein that Soul shall be cut off from among his people six days may work be done but in the seventh is the Sabbath of rest holy to the Lord whosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath day he shall surely be put to death and the man that commits adultery with another man's wife even he that commits adultery and his neighbor's wife the adulter and the adulteress shall both be put to death now listen that's law Leviticus 24 he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord we hear it every day he shall surely in the Old Testament be put to death right and all the congregation shall certainly Stone him they didn't hire an outside guy they didn't hire black water or whatever that you know the CIA or FB no you did it yourself as he that is born as well as the stranger and he that's born in the land when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord shall be put to death now let's go to Psalms 56 though say look for thou Hast delivered my soul from Death will not thou deliver my feet from falling that I may walk before God in the light of the living Psalms 116:15 precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints Proverbs 14:11 The House of the wicked shall be overthrown but the Tabernacle of the upright shall flourish watch there is a way which seeth right unto man but the end thereof are the ways of death they think they're doing right but it's killing them John 5 ver 24 said verely verily I say unto you he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from that death unto Life John 8:51 barely verely I say unto you if a man keep my sayings oh wait a minute if a man keep my sayings he shall never see death now is he talking about natural is he talking about spiritual if he's talking about natural he lied but he's talking about spiritual he shall never see death then said the Jews unto him now we know thou H has a devil what teaching do this come from Abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayth if a man keep my Saints he shall never taste of death they were speaking what carnally over here on this side but Jesus was speaking of heavenly of of not of not dying to death as he was talking about killing them with death acts 2:23 said him being delivered by the determinant counsel and for knowledge of God you have taken and by Wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God hath raised up having loosed the Pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holding of it acts 22:4 and I persecuted this way unto the death now that's Paul this is Paul the great Paul the great one that brought salvation to the Jews and then to the Gentiles he had people killed talk about Grace is that going to ever be held against him it can't but it was before he got born again he was under the law he was doing what the law said right same way with us Romans 6 ver8 now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died under sin once but then he liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon now watch Paul says likewise reckon yourself to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let not sin therefore reign in your look mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof in your mortal body let it don't let it rain in your body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourself unto God now he's talking to Christians hello somebody amen as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but watch but under grace what then now watch Paul's going to take the Greece out of it right here What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace God forbid right know ye not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servant you are to whom you obey whether of sin under death or of obedience under righteousness he's asking the question Romans 6: 211 what fruit had ye then in those things whereever you are now ashamed I'm going to ask you all that one more time Paul's not talking to himself he's not talking to the Romans tonight he's not talking to the Main Street Gospel over there he's talking to Spoken Word Church what fruit had ye when those things thereof ye are now asham whereof you are now ashamed for the end of those things is death but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruit under holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord now listen we died the death in our soul as far as being a Christian remember the old man had to what die all right so we die the death already but God's going to take a group of people and he's going to kill them by the own doctrine that they live by right dead while they're living so let's look and see right here death by death and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which serth the Reigns in heart and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works Romans 7:4 says wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ all right so the committing adultery and all that we know that's wrong and that's bad but that's not a sin unto spiritual death death if you get it if you get it right and get born again but now you didn't have a chance to do that under the law folks right right you died period all right but remember as Paul tells us here in Romans he said the law in other words the law was there but now we're under grace all right wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the Body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit un God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin look which were by the law if you're not born again today you are living under the law and that is death it will kill you you can't come out from under the law the law says do this you're dead amen amen for when you were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members Paul's saying our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held all right we were dead under the law that we should serve in newness of spirit not in the oldness of the letter what shall we say then all right Paul's going to sum this up right here is the law sin God forbid nay I had not known sin but by the law for I had not known lust except the law said Thou shalt not covet but sin taking occasion by the Commandment wrought in me all man manner of concubines for without the law sin was dead for I was alive without the law Once Dead while he Liv for I was alive without law once in other words alive here not alive in his soul but when the Commandment came sin revived and I died and the Commandment watch which was ordained to life I found it to be death Paul took the law Saul sorry Saul took the law he took exactly what God said hello somebody he took exactly the Scrolls of what God Said and killed those people by it right or had him put to death made him blaspheme right from the book he didn't create his own law he was right here but he found out that that was dead itself think about the people Paul met on the other side that he had put to death how'd you get here they asked him how'd you get here thank God for Grace James 1:15 says then when lust has conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's finished when it's finished bringing forth death listen we're all born in sin Paul even said we had our conversation in times past in the lust of the flesh amen Paul talks about lust a good bit he was a man he was a human we're all human and it's not just lusting after women it's lusting after a lot of things listen Paul lusted after Saul lusted after power he wanted power he had Gia and he had uh the other one there and he had all them he was right there with them Sanhedrin he was a he was a big dog he wanted to be the one that they put the whatever different colors around you know robe on him so he could be the righteous one or maybe the high PR you know what I'm sure he was working to be the high priest that's right but boy did God have a different work for that guy so when lust hath conceived now look there's four parts here when lust ha conceived it brings forth sin now and sin when it's finished bring it forth death Revelations 2:1 he that hath the ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death that's what God's talking about the second death Revelations 20:6 blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years Revelations 20:14 and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death now those that are attached to that going in with it hello somebody that's the ones that are attached to that is going in with it and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire so he's going to kill her with death death produces death death produces death God produces life after death not life after death in the grave like right now all right so let's look real quick and it'll be finish at 8:30 not too bad let's look at the sardian church age so remember that th tyan age they died the organizations died the people physically died they were physically killed by the Roman Catholic Church which everything they produced died except for Martin Luther but what did he do he stepped out of that he came out of her my people and he didn't partake of her sin now watch let's go to sardian church age just for a second then we'll then we'll close Revelations 3:1 to the angel of the church in Sardis right the sayith things saith that he that has the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I like how God just keeps reiterating that he's in control here he's got the Stars he's got the spirits all right he's got them I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and art dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God like I said before there was a lot of things Martin Luther brought out of the Catholic church that wasn't true okay false baptism and all that but it wasn't time wasn't time this is the time remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent boy keeps repent repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come to thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee whatever the way the tree leans that's the way it's going to fall all right thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in what white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath a near let him hear what the spirit says to the churches now we' come up to the age of Luther it's going to be the sardian church age from 1520 to 1750 we'll get into it Sunday about all the great things that come up the greatest thing was is like brother R said and I'll quote it where brother Ram said it wasn't that it wasn't about the only thing that that the commentator said about Luther was was that he could hold his head up against all the fanaticism that was going on around him if you'll watch that movie Luther the the the newer newer one you can see them they're burning down churches they're dragging priests out of the churches and and Luther walks up and he runs up here he says what are you doing you know what that guy said he said we're doing what you said they misinterpreted what he said and they were physically tearing the churches up and burning them Luther was burning them spiritually he wasn't burning them naturally he was burning them spiritually but we'll go to the mayonnaise but watch and Sardis was known for dying of wool we'll get into that there's a significance there carpet weaving gold coins were first Meed there the religion was and this we'll cover this and then we'll close mother was siel and son was Deus now that was mother and son worship at first all right everybody with me all right so now he was the son God she was the moon goddess he was the Lord of Heaven she was the Queen of Heaven now this is this is their Pagan this is what's going on in Sardis this is not what's going on with the bride this is what's going on in Sardis is everybody with me he the revealer of goodness and Truth she of gentleness and mercy he the mediator sheath the mediatrix he with the key that opens and shuts the Gate of the invisible world and she with an identical key doing likewise he as the judge of the Dead she is standing at his side he being killed raised and ascended into heaven she carried there bodily by the son this is this is Cel and deos now in Rome this same God has given the title of Our Lord this is Brother R I'm talking he is called the Son of God while she is called the mother of God going to tell you how Pagan really Pagan Rome is they took the world what the world was doing and they were they were they saw that the world was enamored with all these goddesses and gods and Thor and Zeus and remember brother B said they took Mercury down and put Paul up and they took this one down put the other one up well this is what's happening in here the Catholic Church looks at Sardis and looks at there going well they're worshiping a woman and a son but Watch What Happens now that is what we found back there in the other two ages where the mother and Son concept took on such tremendous proportions but now notice that even as it was back in Babylon that the worship of the son began to lose out in favor of the worship of the mother so she literally began to take the place of the son we see in this age that the Pagan worship of Sardis was the worship of the woman it was siel alone not sael and Doos de do the mother was literally taken the place that sound familiar any of you studied the Catholic church this is exactly what they do the mother mother has literally taken the place of the son endowed with the merits of godhead right all one needs to do is go over her various titles and recall the lovely attributes accorded Mary by the Roman Church to understand where the religion of this age came from the fact that this is the age of the first real break with paper Rome that actually flourished no doubt caused the Jezebel prophetess to consolidate and emphasize her doctrine of mariology or the do doctrine that marries God or a mother of God in decided opposition to the Protestants who denied her any part whatsoever and the Plan of Salvation now this is what Martin Luther stood up against he didn't he didn't GA that garbage of motherson worship he come out of that apart from her favor with God as the virgin chosen to Bear the baby as Luther crystallized the doctrine of justification by faith they held to The Works penants prayers and other unscriptural means and as the freed Christians glorified the Sun the Roman Catholic increased their deification of Mary until the 20th century saw in opposition to most high ranking Roman theolog theologians Pope P literally exalted Mary now we're talking about just several years ago I mean not several but 100 years ago Pope literally exalted Mary to glorification in a resurrected body now where did they get that from they got it from the from Sardis sail and the and the sun did away with the sun listen that's what did they do away with Jesus they hardly say anything about Jesus always Mary or Peter or one of the Saints they pray to this one pray to that one you don't have to pray to Jesus Anymore under their pretense that Doctrine is absolutely the the babylonius one of the son carrying the mother bodily into heaven look how subtle Satan is most of your Roman Catholic doctrines come from Pagan worship they know that but they keep the people so I'm sorry to say this so dumb down till they don't even read that thank God for a prophet that came and went back in the back part of God's mind the vision part of God's mind and brought us up into that Vision part where we can see we can see the opposition and see what the opposition's got now the combat Beast or the living creature was a man so now we have the man anointing which is a smart anointing it lasted from 1520 to 1750 and many many things according to um uh history was printing presses and a lot of different things were created during that time that we it's a precursor to what we use now but what God is doing God is bringing them out of the Dark Ages and he's bringing them something that he can give to the people and I hate to say Modern Age but God used the modern age does you not use it tonight you wrote in on it you wrote in on the Modern Age you got it on your phone on your on your wristwatch now that that you can uh This Modern Age Technology that we're talking about well it all started back there it all started with the printing presses so they could print the Bibles and we'll talk about that a little bit let's stand at our feet musicians come on thank God for truth thank God that we can look in scripture thank God that we can look in history I can even look I'm looking in history now and I'm seeing how God is weaving his way through all this junk that we call the earth and the world and religion and and then you know here you got leaders of the country that's doing things you know and and I don't know what the next election's going to be but who cares right who cares what's going on I really don't I just know one thing's for sure Israel is going to stay a nation and God's not going to deal with them until we get out of here so they're waiting it's just like a big you know how you we were well one of the planes we took off the other day Friday it never even it never even hit the brakes soon as it got on the runway it took off but if you ever been to a place with a big airplane and you're sitting there and you feel those
