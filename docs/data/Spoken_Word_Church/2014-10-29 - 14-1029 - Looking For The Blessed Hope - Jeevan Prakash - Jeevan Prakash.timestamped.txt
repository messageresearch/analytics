[27:16] ascended into heaven
[27:19] oh alive
[27:22] you know when I say alive you know
[27:24] something sometimes something comes into
[27:27] my mind you know I was in the Israel you
[27:30] know I was in Jerusalem
[27:32] maybe 24 25 years back brother where you
[27:35] know 25 years back and uh I got it wrong
[27:38] I got a wrong guide
[27:41] he was a Palestinian you know and uh
[27:44] there were you know about 25 30 people
[27:47] were there Americans and Canadians and
[27:49] Europeans and you know I am from Indiana
[27:51] you know about 25 30 people he was he
[27:54] was showing the places you know in
[27:56] Jerusalem and uh you know that gave me
[27:59] opportunity to go into uh going to the
[28:03] Tomb of Jesus Christ and and kneel down
[28:05] and pray to the Lord and that gave me
[28:07] opportunity to praise the name of the
[28:09] Lord and He took us to the mosque of
[28:11] Omar that was Solomon's Temple you know
[28:14] you know many times it was destroyed you
[28:17] know by the kingdoms uh Kings you know
[28:20] so anyhow uh I was there and there is a
[28:24] big of course you must have seen you
[28:26] know in the Moscow from our big rock is
[28:29] there
[28:30] wide you know wide you know and that man
[28:34] that that guide he was telling us when
[28:37] Muhammad was
[28:39] ascending into heaven
