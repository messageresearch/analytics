TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good to be in the house of the Lord good to have have all of you here today hope that your hope and pray that your Christmas season has not ended yet that it's uh last forever and ever okay let's see if we can get on hooked up get start hello hello hello it's not on yet hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello all you technical people turn the off turn back on hello hello hello hello hello hello B hello hello you can hear without we good whatever we got the video all right like I said good to be here good to be back just pray for us now cuz we're going to be we're going to be gone again uh we're leaving next Thursday or Friday sometime and uh we're going to Oklahoma and Kansas and Arkansas and you wants to go to Bass Pro shoping in Springfield Missouri so I'm going to let her do what she wants to do hallelujah amen to that that's where I'll take my nap that's right but um brother Joe will be doing next Sunday and brother Bob will be doing the next Sunday January the 5th okay everybody got that so keep them in your prayers now we're talking about Temperance what I thought about today is is just before we leave for about three weeks cuz the next weekend is a ministers meeting down in Florida so we're probably going to be going to that so we're going to let the prophet and he does just you watch his progression in his ministry how that he progresses through on on temperence and and uhu fruits of the spirit and things that we're supposed to show cuz watch what he says here we're just going to read faith is a substance 1951 you'll see it here says no matter what outward demonstration you give as long as the inward here is the holy spirit it'll be the fruits of the spirit remember we talked about that Wednesday night we're the fruit on the tree of life so whatever fruit is is bore on the tree of life if it's life we're going to Bear life if it's death then we're still on the other tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it'll be the fruits of the spirit longsuffering goodness meekness patient gist Faith Temperance now watch what he says Satan can copy any kind of a gift right any kind of a manifestation but he can't love so we see the Capstone is love but remember that love started at Faith because that give you perfect Faith inside your soul right so that give you perfect love you have that's why brother BR said everybody's got a uh have a has a problem with when brother Brown went behind the curtain of time and they're saying that we' got to have perfect Faith here that brother bram's got to come back and speak that perfect Faith to us but I've always been this way about it brother brandham he goes across the curtain of time we know that that's the people cuz he said are these all randoms and he said no he said they're your converts converts all right uh born again I told her asked a brother one time that was that was saying Oh Brother R's got to come back to bring perfect Faith but if you read in the in the message brother Bram asked the angel well who are these people he said well there your convert right he said this is where perfect love is well now what was the every person in that Dimension had one thing in common they were white black red green orange short tall he said they had had red hair they had brown hair they had you know all the different colors but what did they have one thing in common they had the new birth while they were here on Earth they had the new birth and was born again under brother R's Ministry so that is perfect Faith that's the only way they could get there so it's not that we got to go there to get perfect Faith or brother ry's got to come back here to give us perfect faith when you're born again you get perfect faith right it's just that's just as simple as you can make it you get perfect faith when you're born again or perfect love but what has to happen is like I've always said You' got that capsule you're the capsule this is Bor this was off the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil all right so this is what we got to fight we got to fight man's knowledge we got to fight man's Temperance we got to fight cuz there is a Godly Temperance did you read what we were reading here what God all the things that the Lord was a lightning bolt and he was he was he gets mad he hates God hates sin so he has he has a temperament about him God had listen that's where these things come from these virtues come from almighty God they don't come from the devil but he says look he says Satan can copy any kind of a gift any kind of a manifestation but he can't love that's right see Satan can't love you see a humble man loving good to his neighbor good citizen good fell and a good man and a Christian man full of love and humility you watch that man you watch him and that's what you got to do you watch him that's right he's good charitable longsuffering you can talk about him it's all right he forgives you don't make any difference there that's the real man keep your eye on him that man Bears what bears fruit he's the example but remember he goes on and says that don't matter how much you shout in church and all those things like that it's going to come down to where it's going to be perfect love hidden life in Christ 1955 and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering goodness dealing this patience meanness Temperance all right fruits of the spirit God knows today that's what the Holiness people need now they probably thought they already had that the Pentecostal people the the the Holiness people that's what they were supposed to be living but brother Bar's telling them in 1955 you got away from that remember what brother Dale was in the Bible study you know about the the messenger coming to the End of the Age Paul rebuked the true the people that were born again he rebuked those people for falling away from their first love now brother Brandon was rebuking the Pentecostals cuz at one time they had love joy peace long suffering goodness gentl but remember he said now they fight with a temper like a buz saww well that's Temperance they did not have the virtues to carry them on on up the pyramid problem was they didn't have anybody to preach them all right brother Bram came to preach these virtues that now they're a requirement since they've been revealed God knows today that what the Holiness people need and also the calvinist all of them needs today is more fruit of the spirit he didn't say more Spirit he said more fruits of the spirit all of them needs more fruit of the spirit more lives to prove it all right let's go around here and here's one of the greatest hindrances that there in the church today right here Edmonton or everywhere not Edmonton I didn't mean to say that I mean Prince Albert among other people everywhere is fear there's that word fear but love perfect love cast us out fear so the reason you're fearful is because the right Temperance of love we think a lot of times Temperance is we got to have control our ungodly temper well that's true but watch what brother Brown says the right Temperance of love that has never entered yet so it's not been preached it's 1956 he's about four or five years away from preaching the statute of perfect man see when there's real love all fear passes away all right by your fruits you'll know them the fruit of the spirit is love joy goodness meekness patience long suffering Faith Temperance all these find qualities that the world is looking to see in the Christian church they put the scope of God by Baptist Methodist Pentecostal nazarine all that they're looking for God all right weeping is not fruit listen shouting is not fruits for the spirit shouting at somebody is not either yeah we have 20 you were talking about all the things that um the fruits of the spirit are but there are denominational people that are happy it's hard to they're happy but like brother Brown said where the love of God is not that you're all Levy Dey that's not the love of God remember the love of God is corrected if the words presented to them and they turn it down they don't have that cross them up they just have nor normal they just have normal human love you can have every one of them one of them not not be born again absolutely you can have a bit of a piece of it you can't have all of it you can't have all somewhere brother R said in the statute of per man said you'll show your true colors all right so um you know and there is like Brother Richard Wilson There was a man at work for him at the bearing place there that he was so meek and Mild that that he said I believe you could have told him one week that we just not going to pay you nothing we're not going to make pay you a paycheck you going to work 40 hours we're not going to pay he said he' probably say yeah okay fine thank you you know that's to me that's just the temperamental part of what comes across in this guy because remember we were uh mom and I were talking about a certain family line and and your family line means a lot there's a certain family line of of two certain families in in Gillsville and which were K to one of them and they're K to each other and they have temper like you wouldn't believe and if they were born again they'd still have a little bit of that on this side but God would take care of that because they would come to the word and the word would mellow them out but the problem is they're not born again and they fight like cats and dogs but you have to look see shouting is not the fruit of the spirit cuz look watch weeping is not this fruit of the spirit but love joy now he don't mean just love joy P that ain't like I said last couple weeks ago sorrow brings Joy sorrow brings Joy do you think Jesus in his Humanity was joyful that he was going to the Cross no I don't think so but that thing that was inside of him that tie poost because remember he said not my will but thy will be done now we've got to get to where we come to that where our will would be to fight back and we do because we'll overcome that little that that thing inside of us now don't worry about me calling it a thing I told him wherever I was preaching couple weeks ago I said look the Bible calls you the thing that Holy thing that'll be born in you that was God that was the almighty so so uh you know what Gabriel didn't have a revelation of exactly who that was cuz he was an old Testament he was he was the the Jewish Messenger right but Michael would know who he was Michael would have knew that was Christ or that would have been him but um but the salutation was that Holy thing so anyway that thing that's born in you but love joy peace longsuffering remember when you read that You' got to read that with a whole different look than people in the world I hope that's what you're getting from this this is not just normal people right right this is not right this is not normal love because brother R said it breaks down to it goes to to AG goth of love which is the love of God top of the pyramid down to filal love which you love for your wife then it keeps going down and brother Brown said because of the Fall it keeps going to lust and then it keeps going to perversion it's the same thing you know it's like I said many times before we always say I love to go hunting or I love to read the I love do you I mean is that real love no that's not real love it's just something that you desire to do we ought to just say we desire to go hunting or we desire to go fishing because it's not a love we use that word so loosely but that true love is what's sitting here today in the I don't want to even say the message of the hour but in the New Birth that you have that's where that love is residing that love is there nowhere else in the world right if not if it is then they're all going to heaven right that's that word love has been so eroded till now you go to a funeral and it doesn't matter like I said it doesn't matter if the guy's a drunk and died a drunk he's going to heaven somehow no he's not no sorry he's not if he didn't repent right at the right at the end of his life no he's not like brother Brady stood up at time he said mine lived a drunk he died a drunk he's going to hell hold his family that at a funeral at a funeral at the man's funeral cuz they always say if there's anything anybody got to say before we you know let go the preacher gets up preach the guy in the glory you know and brother Brady knew him and brother Brady he said he told us this he stood he put his hand up he said I tell you he said I tell all of you he he said A man was a drunk he lived a drunk life he didn't do nothing but drink never went in a church that I know of and said if he didn't repent in the last minute of his life he's in hell right now and boy they didn't like it but you know what somehow the truth hurts that's right but love joy peace longsuffering don't get that as words we've got to go beyond we've got to see the Revelation that's behind love the Revelation that's behind Joy the Revelation that's behind peace the ration is behind longsuffering you can have peace and look like the world is just falling apart in your life you know that's when God's got a hold of you you not got you've not got a hold of your own feelings all right longsuffering goodness gentleness Faith meekness Temperance that's the fruits of the spirit that's what the spirit's fruits are all right now the reason we have these things they like to make organ well what he's saying is is talking about organization that's what we're talking about now organizational people sure you see people that are happy but you know what if they're not born again there's going to be a time when they ain't going to be real happy when we get out of here and go and go to glory in a Rapture and all hell breaks loose down here you'll see how joyful they are then I mean that's just the way it is so that's what I mean about God God is not God is a Jud he's a judge he's just he can't let somebody go to heaven a different way than somebody else go to heaven you all got to come the same way all right all nine gifts has to be working in the church and the fruits of the spirit is love joy Faith longsuffering gness patience goodness meekness Temperance there's the fruits of the spirit now if that look watch this now if that's operating in your life now watch what he says if that's operating in your life blessed be the name of the Lord but if some of it's there without the rest of it be careful your own Dangerous Ground see Satan can impersonate most anything that God does but you can tell it's not mixed with love or neither has it Faith the word being preached not profit them from being mixed with faith that's pretty good there I like that one what brother say we had to have substance faith and other words sub Faith was sub substance cuz the people go to church now in the denominational churches they're going by faith the faith that they see they believe that if they'll go to church or Paint The Barking Lot or if they believe they'll do that but you know what I was thinking coming down the road today it's Penance I I was as we were driving by I thought of a a man real nice man real good man don't believe it he I believe he's um for what he knows he's a nominal Christian and I drove by his house and I saw his car there but what they usually do is is they'll go to the Methodist Church and have a men's breakfast cuz I spoke at it one time they have a men's breakfast well they don't go back to church after that but see they felt they've done their Duty and the first thing came to my my mind was Penance they've done their Penance they went to that bre Men's breakfast under the under the umbrella of religion done their Duty for the day cuz Catholics and mass is the same way they don't go to church on Sunday unless they have mass on Sunday morning they'll go take mass and communion and they're gone same way that's the way that's the way it's happening now in message churches just be honest with you sorry about that but it happens you say look he's talking about the U Witch Doctors Jesus Never Said by their tongues you shall know them but by their fruits you shall know them Ephesians 5:1 say the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering goodness temp gentleness patience meanness faith and Temperance is that right there you are cuz what's happened is those people he said they're sincere what they cut theirself they throw their babies to the to the alligators to appease God it's just it's that Penance thing all right look he's talking about Esau watch the dad always said about Esau Esau if you took Esau's natural life versus Jacob's Natural Life you'd pick Esau every time I would he helped his poor old daddy he brought his daddy food right he done all the things that he was supposed to do he acted like he was in line but remember there was one thing he didn't have it was love for that Birthright now what's the birthright to a Christian the new birth so so what people will do is the Esau's of the world now good neighbor good life in the neighborhood Esau never harm nobody but Esau was of the devil why because he took that birth right cast it aside New Birth same way you present the gospel to people and they turn it down brother Bram said predestination off Jacob they came out of the same womb so they came from a Godly Mom and Daddy but Esau turned down the very thing a type of the new birth he turned it down but he was he would be a nominal chrisan now hey Jacob didn't do nothing but just kind of wander around and he was a Shyer all the way up a poor old father-in-law they were sitting there uh shying each other until uh until God got a hold of Jacob and then what Jacob had to have a name change you had to have a name change to Israel all right let's see a few going here he comes into the statue of perfect man let's get Temperance right here add Temperance oh my we've come to Temperance now you've got you've had Faith first have to have that to begin with then you add virtue to your faith if it's the right kind of virtue then you add knowledge if it's the right kind of knowledge now you're going to add Temperance right Temperance does not mean stop drinking alcohol no no Temperance doesn't mean alcohol cure not in this case this is Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance that's what all these you must put Holy Spirit in front of it cuz it's the like I said in the in the sermon with the uh Genesis 126 to me this is a Genesis 126 man in full manifestation that's what that genesis6 man had but it was eroded or like brother brand said it become blackened after the fall we couldn't get to that remember what I what I was telling you last Wednesday night man couldn't even get to the new birth until Jesus came did you not see what I said in in in the in the sermon there's no way you the new the new birth the the baptism of the Holy Ghost that he wanted everybody to come forth with man and human flesh women in human flesh with all these virtues totally working in their life that's what he wanted all right well that didn't happen because of the Fall which we know that the sin that sin had to come so he could come and pay the price to get us back to it well what did he do he brought all these gifts because remember Peter had them Paul had them James John all the apostles the 120 in the upper room even Mary was that the faith of the father so they had these things it's not that this is something new I told you this before this is not something new that's got to work in our life it's worked in Peter it's worked in James it's worked in Paul it's worked in Mary it worked in whoever was in that upper room all right but down during the ages it was so eroded or or why we don't need that till the Holy Spirit couldn't work brother BR said he's been bound for 2,000 years under what the door of Creeds and dogmas well what is Creeds and dogmas against preaching Temperance well you have a hey the Pentecostals they got a terrible temper I used to work with one talk about the Lord and cuss you out the next minute I mean didn't bother them a bit but this is Holy Spirit Temperance that's just one of the lust of the flesh but we're talking about about Holy Spirit Temperance that means how to control your tongue not be a tler how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you oh my boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started aren't we cuz remember he had a bad temper he would have been a murderer if God hadn't helped him yes he would have he put them bullets in that gun and he met them boys on that road and he had ever how many shells in that gun and he said I unloaded the gun and I'm sure at that time it was a bolt action so he was sitting there click B he was trying to get one in other words what I'm saying was he didn't just shoot one time and quit he was trying to get one of them to fire while them boys was running off right remember he put He said I put all the bullets back in the gun and he said every one of them fired well see he had a temper remember he said the teacher told him to tie the string around his finger with a knot you know tie a knot said you remember he got frustrated said he was untie ti ti ti said he just throw this thing down and went to fighting well you know what he had a temper he was a human but he overcame that he didn't get mad at the boy he didn't get mad at the guy that was going to try to kill him he said something took over that's what you and I have got to look at something must take over that's right all right now if it doesn't then that's where we need to work on if something doesn't take over like I told you about you know saying the bad words that I used to say so frequently and and then the Lord sto him stopping you know what he knew that I didn't want to do it but by my own human self I was so quick to do it that it was just a it was just a reaction and he wouldn't let me say it well see when he did that that showed me at least that God was trying to keep me straight you know trying to give me a little virtue a little knowledge maybe a little bit of temperance all right but a lot of us are going to fall off before we get started aren't we see then we wonder why God is not in his church doing Miracles and things that they used to do book of Acts book of Acts had these virtues working in their life all right now that we got to get back to that before we can get to anything else we want to speak the word and and have the manifestation of the third pull well you got to have this first before the manifestation because remember power without character is satanic so this is character this is character power with character is fit to rule all right now add these things add Temperance old temperence how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoke to you somebody says you bunch of Holy Rollers down there don't jump up and roll your sleeves up now see not that but talk with Godly love Temperance kindness is that the way you want to be congregation says amen when you're red upon R not back let him be your example they said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread he could have done it and showed he was was God but he had Temperance when they called him be above he said I'll forgive you for that that's right they pulled a handful of the beard out of his face and spit on his face come down off the cross he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing when he had the gift he knowed all things for in him was the fullness of the godhead botling they had seen him perform Miracles by telling people what was wrong with him and so forth like that they put a rag around his head and around his eyes and hit him on the head with a stick and said prophesy tell us who he him we'll believe you see he had Temperance now if you got it like that add it to your faith if you still blow up and Sass and fuss and stew and carry on uh-huh you ain't got no you can't add that cuz it won't add it won't vulcanize you couldn't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron it just won't work that's got to be flexible just like the rubber is see when your faith and your Temperance becomes the same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that he had not that you mama had or your daddy had that he had then it will vulcanize with him you're added to it when your virtue is like his virtue than add to it when your knowledge is like his knowledge I come to do thy will oh God see with the father's word he defeated every devil Heaven and Earth will pass you away but the word will not when you got that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize with your faith when you got the right kind of temperance like he had it'll vulcanize if you hadn't just a manmade halfway soued up belief or Temperance oh I ought to slap him down but maybe I better not cuz they might put my name in the paper about it that ain't the kind of temperance he's talking about don't try to add that it won't work but when you can really with the sweetness from your heart forgive every man hold your peace let it be done see then it'll vulcanize you can add that to your faith no wonder of the church is so short isn't that right no wonder I'd say repent and be baptized the Bible said in the name of Jesus Christ strict traran trinitarian don't believe that that that in Christ he's a Jesus name he's a Jesus only Look Out Boy I don't know about your Temperance right now why don't you come say let's reason together brother Brandon I'd like to hear this explained see then come down and listen to it then it put right before you and you you can walk away well we'll get to that in just a minute in godl but see when you fly loose want to jump at every conclusion uh-huh that's not it you haven't got Bible Temperance yet when you do that how to answer back now to me that's it right there how to answer back that's the whole thing how how to answer back is the whole that's the whole part of temperance cuz remember it's going to be tested so you're not going to go through life and God's going to say well I'm going to keep all this temperament away from you I'm going to keep all these people with tempers away from you and you're not going to get cut off in them road somewhere and you're not going to get this or somebody's not going to jump in line no it will come but he says how to answer back to that cuz it's how you react right you can't control how that person reacts right but you can control how you react and that's the greatest thing that I can say to you is let's have temperance to who we can answer back in the same Holy Spirit Temperance that God would answer back hey let me tell you something he's longsuffering with you and me so let's be longsuffering with each other and with people right A lot of people act like to do cuz they're not born again that's just a bottom line they act like they do cuz they got new birth and you can't help them do that you sure you can live the life that's the greatest thing you can do is live the life in front of of them and and and you know speak in peace speak in faith it don't mean for somebody to run over you that know what that means but it means to how do you answer back like Daddy said a guy breaks in your house if he's coming for my wife I'm going to shoot him if I have to but then I'm going to get down and pray for his soul and pray for God to heal his The Bullet Hole you know so Lord bless you have Temperance you definitely need it in this time Christmas stuff going on so let's have temper
