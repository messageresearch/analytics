through that right amen did you see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turning your scriptures turn to Jonah 2 and Ephesians 2 we've had to have our visitors with us and we had to have some that had been in a while they're not visitors come one time here your visitor you come two times you're just part of us no that's mr. way things goes aren't glad to have each one then we had a real good time last night at the fellowship meeting brother Jason Watkins preached a real good message we had a good time fellowship in so now remember that this coming Tuesday now won't be services Wednesday night now it'll be services Tuesday not because of Thanksgiving and all the to it and brother Louise will be ministering for us the Tuesday night all right I remember then this coming weekend that brother Joe green will be here with us ministering on this coming weekend so remember remember these announcements anything else anyhow Jonah - in Ephesians 2 the only father we thank you for your grace in your love more than to us thank you for everything that you've given us and we know you've given it to us freely we praise your great name we ask you to just got each one of us and let your love and understanding be with us Lord we thank you for the children and all of their singing this morning's or hearts of Thanksgiving unto you and all of the adults and things the ones who work with them and all we thank you for each and every one and praise your great name we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen when - Jonah - and then we'll go to Ephesians Jonah comes down you know he remember he's in the whale's belly and he's coming down to the point and he says I don't know which way it is but I'm supposed to turn towards the temple so I'm gonna just look this way and I'm gonna pray so he says first nine but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the feast and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land on it let's go to Ephesians two and we'll start with verse four but God who is rich in mercy mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins have quick have quickened us together with Christ by grace you are saved now watching repeat this in a minute when God repeats something remember it's a good point and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved through faith then one that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast you may be seated to the Lord that is best thing to the reading of the word now remember all of the announcements that you have on the sheets and things for you to you know consider alright we've been talking a few services now on salvation what Richard or some of you might order turn a little bit of the air or something because it's uh it's kind of stuffy for everybody and they're Fannin and then you turn too much and others are freaking and so ok just try to stir up something anyway alright talking about salvation and what we'll have we we're using the word salvation as talking about and using it as the word deliverance deliverance because that's what salvation is and Jonah was saying you know I've paid my vials I'll do all of this I'll do everything I can and said but salvation is of the Lord all right so then we know it's not what you and I can do or have done or whatever salvation is of the Lord but we're staying basically now in the services we've been this is the third message and we're trying to hold it over into the Old Testament not coming over into the New Testament yet but what we're planning on doing and hope we can keep laying it out is whatever the lineup for the Old Testament is of salvation deliverance you'll find it in the New Testament it's only climbs into a higher order it's just a greater expression or more bringing it into view but you go back to that word salvation you know as I said we used it like when Moses was telling the children of Israel said stand still and see the salvation of the Lord when the Red Sea opened up you knowing the things all right that word salvation is basically using it as deliverance deliverance something that is bound are in your way are happening and you get delivered from it and you can call it the word salvation all right because that is the basis in when we say salvation we we talk about new tenant new birth Jesus Christ and all that's fine but getting back in the Old Testament and studying because they were sure a salvation back there all right because that would be the point all right now see as it came to pass in the Old Testament of this part we talk about salvation as I said now we can surely expect to see in the New Testament an amplified greater understanding of salvation and we'll start calling it the new birth we'll start calling it being born again you know and the things but remember in the Old Testament there was not anything there to give eternal life to this to the person because Jesus Christ had not died yet all right you gotta wait until Christ dies to give his life to release that then it can come back in to the person and in back dire then see you'd say that's the point I'm getting in so you say you mean they wouldn't say back there that's the point I'm driving they had a salvation back there all right but they didn't have the new birth they didn't have eternal life in their soul and that's why they would go out and do and and be human beings all right because they were under that point that there were not any new birth now that everybody follow that man it's not they didn't have a salvation they had a salvation of deliverance they had that and not only that now what is the proof that we've been talking about of them having salvation they had a place to go to when they died is that simple enough the their salvation their deliverance for whatever they were doing and whatever happened to him supplied them a place to go when they passed away you know all right they went into what would be called Paradise or it was called as the blue stone of Abraham not meaning the belly or the part it just means it was really a shroud like thing that came down and went up around and it was really a holder you know just the thing out in front and and there's it's just using it as an example to express you know what's taking place but now get you know what I'm saying cutter don't you misunderstanding it see when I get on the end of things later in speed he said but they you mean they wouldn't say back they were saved for the time they were saved for the point that they were all right everything remember we've always taught it tried to believe it back to the denomination's told it we've had this touted everybody order to about it but there was one thing about it was we know that there was one salvation in the Bible that would be made possible and that was only through the blood of Jesus Christ all right and see then it pushed all mankind the sins of mankind had to come to Calvary all right so if the sins came to Calvary you know they were pointing to a greater salvation than what they were possessing for the time all right that would be why David would cry out you know in his soul and and all I hadn't returned unto me the joy of thy salvation he just didn't he didn't have it there to be able to be like the New Testament alright now to keep that thought in mind we've talked about salvation and what is it based upon alright your life Stokes was paragraph 35 of God keeping his word salvation is based upon the Bible the Word of God any religious movements they have a form of what we would call Bible or textbook or our book things to explain and they put their salvation into wording the best they can and in that wording is that there that is the certain realm that they live in right and then you have this to do and that to do and it's to do not to do and you have that all set up in their writings well we take the Bible as being the Word of God and believing that that Bible then the you know shows us the way of salvation but it not only shows us salvation today he shows the salvation that was back dark all right because surely you'd want to believe that they had some form you know or wasn't just cast away because like I said they had a place to go to when they died and to show that it was right remember Jesus went to Paradise to the souls that were in prison you know and and spoke to them groups of people being dark then comes into paradise and picks up the Old Testament Saints and brings them out in his resurrection in the form of what they were to do all right now to just remember if you have a salvation it must be based upon something all right now I've always contended and always will to hold a point to believe in that we're saved by grace through faith all right grace is unmerited favor point grace unmerited favor you can't do anything to get it because it's not a set of rules or it wouldn't be unmerited favor it's totally of God and given to mankind to only have one thing for mankind to do and that's believe it right to believe it whatever religion you'd be today it's still based on what you believe you know what I mean your thoughts you believe it all right now so I think about it now salvation then is not based biblical salvation of what anything the old are the new is not based upon what you do or don't do he said well they had to allow wait a minute don't don't run over to the law yet we're still a we're still back way before then you run over to the law to try to have the law as something for you to do or don't do there's no salvation in the law the law is a condemned ER I had order be enough sense you go to court you go to court they read it that's the law it says you do this they give you this right there's no grace in the law now listen to what I'm making these statements were later there was grace before the law there was grace in the law then you said wait a minute you just said he wasn't in this grace after the law it's all in how you understand of what grace is and what you're talking about of what salvation is on see there there's no way the law condemns you it is puts in jail so don't try to think that you could have some salvation as the law that was the greatest mistake mankind made when he accepted the law he accepted it thinking it was grace he thought it was the book of rules what did he need that far the grace was laid before law because that's what we want to get to now today when I remember bay Grace is based upon the Word of God explaining it showing it to you and it shows you that it's not anything you can do it's what he's already done all right now you say yeah but don't you do this don't you do that an answer of a good conscience now we've got a long ways to go I'll ask you a question up front what is the heathen judged by you see we're going a long ways we're still in the Old Testament so remember that what is the heathen judge by remember you can't condemn him because he has no law so we got a long ways to go alright see salvation is based upon what the word says now listen it's not based upon what somebody else tells you the word says that's hearsay that won't work even the court of law says hearsay doesn't work if you're saying what somebody else says if that person would be Almighty God now you can have a point of speaking but see even God doesn't speak he's already spoken he doesn't know how to speak he's already spoken he's already settled before the world ever begun right all right now see then it's based upon the word but listen it's based upon what you think or believe about the the Word of God that's my whole point basing upon what you think something personal to you you said well I know I'm going to have them come mom Adam well okay mamma's that's between her and God but I don't have anything do you see you can just say you know because the Bible says that what now no man can call Jesus the one the Christ how except it be by the Holy Ghost you get a drunk as the Prophet would say going down the highway you stop him here all this drugged up for them and you say is Jesus God Jesus is God I see any mother day wasn't smoking him Joey sighs I seen even you know they do a lot of that in those what does that mean he saved and we're not in the old Baptist days of once saved always say we stole my that light's not coming home it may be a odd way of stating it but you know that according to the Baptist doctrine of once saved always saved then that guy that went in the church out there and killed about 12 people 20 people shot up the place if he ever joined the bad discharged he's in heaven that don't sound good doesn't it I didn't agree with that when I was in the Baptist Church okay I spent a lot of years there and I didn't agree with it then because that just don't work once saved always say once truly born again yes cuz you ain't go out you are not gonna go out and shoot up the world and kill everybody we'll get to those things but not just because you say well I joined the church you ever heard this one I've heard people say I know that brothers in heaven because he paved the parking lot now I'm not making light of what people talking the way they bury people and what they do but what's bearing them what no covering a parking lot got to do with salvation this everybody thinks that there's something about that they can do something to be saved we just remember now we're starting in the Old Testament if we can anchor in the Old Testament to see that there's nothing you can do to be saved except believe if there's anything you could do to be saved or keep you saved then you you don't need Jesus Christ all right that's sensible that's plain language because that's that's the truth all right then we got down to the point of talking about salvation it's based upon the blood salvation is placed upon the blood so you go through all the Old Testament with the blood sacrifice it was an animal sacrifice it had no soul within that animal all right so that sold in that out in that animal I mean did I want something to come back up on the believer it was just an animal life but it was taken because the animal was used as the fall instrument and thereby he was taken and used to make atonements but now watch when we get to that in a minute all right yeah it's based upon the blood but now listen it's based upon your faith in the blood and whether it's for you see salvation is a personal experience between you and God no matter if you were in the Old Testament or if you'd in the New Testament that's why you you read what the scripture said abraham believed God and what it say about it and said it was imputed unto him for righteousness well because he believed everything in salvation is based upon whether you can believe or not but see that's the word easily use oh I believe I see you see I believe that's an easy word to use in it but remember if you believe you live you don't live you don't believe is that enough you believe all you want to live like the devil who are you let's be the devil but that's just plain language all right but it's based upon whether or not you can believe that it's for you all right you remember what we were reading from the way of the of to have fellowship that their God laid out a map a mat through the blood for those of Adam and Eve in the garden all right now here's the point that we've tried to get over and I'll eat reenter you know like to say it over again cause I want you to keep thinking about just remember when sin entered the picture in the garden God himself took the animals and killed him and made an atonement there was anybody else by car to do it for him now I see you got to get out of your old denominational ideas then see we saw brother Dale God is just a spirit how could a spirit take off the you know the skins he didn't how real is your God you say you mean blood you believe that God is capable of taking skins off of animals and and it's all for them as a sacrifice if you don't believe that what kind of a god you got that's his honest that I'd say you said what God is the spirit you know there's thinking when he gets the spirit that's blowing around no God is real remember that we put the whole basis on the reality of a living God God kill those animals according to Genesis 3:21 he said he made coats of skin and gave them to Adam and Eve you remember what they were doing they were playing with fig leaves thinking that covered their nakedness right okay the God said that won't work she said get rid of the thing leave your covering and take what I've got now that's the point we're dealing with you got to believe that God done it for you it's no need of thinking about God doing it for somebody else what what good is it it's whether or not you can believe God did it for you because remember as we read twice now the Bible says by grace are you saved now father truly what we're talking about of the blood of Jesus Christ see then everything is based upon believing that blood atonement was for you in the Old Testament they would have to take an animal and they would cure it down to the high priests and the high priests took the animal and you just put your hands on the animal and you cut the throat of the animal all right and you could feel it moving and jump and you could see the blood and it even splatter on you and what was it do it you knew that atonement was for you it wasn't see I never did believe I've always been hard and strong I know about the blood of the Old Testament I never did believe you just every year you know it was required that you do certain homeless right I never did believe that man just was recording you may want him animals and remember they got it so easy so that's what Jesus drove him out of the temple and the thing they got it made to her everything was right there it was a drive through atonement you know you know I'm dumb about you go down to McDonald's you can go through the drive-thru him well that's about it what it had turned out to be it turned out to be you just woke up though the money down the guy gives you a lamp you take it out flip it to the high priests or the priests you going about you doing he killed him but that wasn't what it was it was sincerity he puts your hand upon the animal and knowing that your sins then that that was in your place make an atonement now what's the point now see but we must believe then that way that I wouldn't be taking one in to give it for you and know the high priest now he went once a year to give for everybody all right we see regular priesthood and regular things it was a daily thing they were just thousands of thousands of animals every day being sacrificed and there were far the people than you might you had to do that as a sacrifice all right but not as I said then it wouldn't be for me to walk up and I'd say ok wait I'll take yours are you just going back to you I'll take yours and go over there with it and and I'll just I'll give him for all of us I guess I'll just get a whole box full and we'll just do the whole family no they were very serious remember especially to the high priest you know that that high priest when he went in for that to make that yearly atonement for the whole children of Israel they tied a rope around him you know why they tied the rope around him because nobody wouldn't allowed behind there with him well what if there's a tone that wouldn't ride and he's gonna die how you gonna get him out they tied a rope around him he had bells and pomegranates on him to where would he walked around in there that they know he was still moving at least he was bit alive because they could hear the ringing of the bells but if he died in there so you had to pull him out and it had to go back through a lot of rituals of re sanctifying everything to get it set for that and remember that guy was dead then sure didn't do him any good making an atonement but alright but see now watch that in a minute grace has to be before your atonement grace has to come first it's not the atonement made for me it's it's the grace that made God come upon the scene to make the atonement that's in God by grace came upon the scene grace is what broadened our and then he made the atonement for the people for Adam and Eve and as he made that atonement he then that the grace was first yeah I've always told y'all I like old I like old Jonah and you just read that sometime you read The Book of Jonah and you get in iron you read about him and when he starts out here he's pretty plain because he's a prophet but he's talking to God I meant I thought I ought to read that today to you but you're to read it yourself and understand read the Book of Jonah and he's really talking to God and he's really saying to God you know because God had told him what what to do and how that all would take a girl he said lord I knew from the beginning the reason he was running he said God I knew from the beginning that you wasn't gonna kill them people you think God don't know a lot about all the things he knew I was gonna happen in the garden quick and he made man and put him in there on a free moral agency I'll ask you another question probably never answer it this morning but ask you another question you believe Adam and Eve was put on and on put on a conditional covenant or an unconditional they were put on a conditional covenant if you will I will why did God put him on a conditional covenant when he'd already made grace oh my stirrup you're thinking to consider the fact of continuing the story later on you know as Paul Harvey says page 2 maybe you'll want to listen to what we're talking about I like to ask questions and I also know what the Bible says questions gender strife but remember questions makes a strong Church so let's don't go wrong okay now listen but now salvation then was based upon what God said he was going to do so when he made man he made him in a condition you know that made him his purist could be all right making that to show what he was going to do all right and see when when it come to the fact what's the point of grace grace salvation is based upon grace you said no it's based upon atonement no it's grace before atonement come on God don't wait for you to do something and then turns around and tells you to go do something to get it over with he's already forgiven you if you'll believe it see if you're safe where was you saved according to revelations dirt what did it three I believe it it where your name was written on the book of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world thirteen eight well see then which came first in did sin come and then God made an atonement and then he said it's okay no he already said before the world ever begun it's okay what I said about the Book of Jonah you'll read it sometime the Bible's real specific about things if you'll just read it and get them let me say it not oh not against anybody let me say it this way get them denominational glasses off it you're reading what they teach to you or have talked to you and read it for yourself sometime just read the Bible for yourself and say Lord that's speaking to me my grace are you saved it's always been Grace there's never been anything else you remember what the Prophet that lady was there he was in hospital and she was asking him how what he is religion words or whatever and said oh that's all he said this is the oldest religion that's ever been was grace grace is the oldest religion that's ever been thought of why because grace goes back before the foundation in the world remember in the morning stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy well then I go out and live like the devil just remember one thing if you live like the devil you are the devil solving the problem we're gonna get to that that's where you're gonna have to one of these days think it over you know the heater and could be given eternal life and me and you loo lose what we call or think as eternal life because of our ways and our thoughts what's the heater and gonna be based on you ain't heard salvation hey we got scriptures don't worry about it we'll continue on all right but what happened before the foundation of the world then we've been through that right that was in God's foreknowledge right that was in his mind right it was not a reality it was not a reality of literal people up in heaven as the morning stars which you know would be the angels and their singing and the sons of God be the children of God it wasn't a literal physical corporal on using those words in turn right that it was not something physical back there it was in the mind of God it was by his foreknowledge how does God predestinate those who he foreknew he did predestinate so he predestination by foreknowledge all right but that's going back to his mind so don't never think that we were back gar as literal people walking around up in heaven that's more money exists Mormon doctrine of pre existence and that won't work well he was in God's mind but in God's mind he knew we would fall are you with me he knew we would fall he knew that if he gave us free moral agency we would choose the wrong come on church you still you're not getting my point they were on free more agency you know the biggest portion of people this message don't believe in free moral agency well now I want you to explain to me if you don't believe in free moral agency I want you to explain to me one thing why did God have to sacrifice an animal if it was already done before he got here and didn't why did he have to die itself on Calvary if it was done before we got here so remember now what is before the foundation of the world is in God's mind not as a reality of corporal people you may think sometimes I get so close to that but now it's it's not there's no such thing as human corporal beings you know 16 element bodies etc there's nothing like that back there it was God in his mind but he knew in his mind that we would fall he knew if he made man he'd fall us and us he's got in us oh did he knew we'd fall if he gave us free moral agency well didn't why did he give it to us he give it to us where he would have it two bases to work what he could come to that free moral agency in save you or he could come to the free moral agency and condemn you one of the other faces you right now you're either saved or your loss right now and it's facing you up on the basis of your free moral agency of whether or not you accept or reject okay now listen so grace came before the atonement had to be made but it was not a physical corporal being it was what God knew he would do because he knew what we do so he put us on a free moral agency to accept or reject all right and by doing that he left mankind as to be his own condemned ER we have the choice that condemns us he had he not as I said had he not given them a conditional covenant of Adam and Eve there would have been no free moral agency it would have been a stamp done deal before you got here there's a lot of difference in what God sees before the world and what reality comes to life when reality came to life in the garden by giving the man the free moral agency to choose to reject God could say okay it's based on what you do or don't do now remember listen I'll go back over this and over it go to the take it remember the Covenant that he made was man was not the law he didn't make the Covenant that was wait that's three thousand years old one or two thousand years later more not before the law came into existence it was not the law they didn't break the Ten Commandments they hadn't been given but the Word of God was the law the law says don't and listen he didn't write about the rule said now you don't do this you don't lie you don't cheat you don't steal you don't do that's what we think about do's and don'ts what was the law that he gave Adam and Eve you ever think about what was the law that he gave Adam and Eve how could they have been on condition that come on we can read what the prophecy it because you don't argue about it Adam and Eve they don't like one word to keep they were on a conditional covenant and they failed under that conditional cut what was that conditional covenant he wasn't a bunch of do's and dont's they had never got into nothing like that the condition was one time don't / take of that tree that was the only don't do that they had it wasn't something telling them don't lie don't cheat don't steal it wasn't back there it hadn't even got started those existence were the law and the things that are coming he simply told him don't / take of the tree of knowledge that was the condition that was put on what a produc because they were free moral agents and when they predict / took then they were condemned but just remember as quick as they / - the grace of his mind before the world ever begun didn't wait and kill an animal and how grace grace produced the atonement come on don't have the atonement producing grace get the right order grace produced the atonement grace is what sacrificed the animals oh you think about the Lord Jesus Christ hanging on Calvary and he wouldn't hang in there for his sins and well he was hanging out for you and me making an atonement that grace had already covered before then and it already spoke of his coming you see why it's so hard to try to hold the Old Testament out through the Word of God the kodan if ties together and goes all the way through all right where do you following me God's mind he knew what they would do he already had - he already had in his mind what he was going to do but he couldn't just go out and do it it wasn't a reality back to her understand me there wasn't more little people back there it was in his mind then when it come on over that he brought in a man in condition that he did he said now you got a conditional covenant if you partake of that tree then you're done you're finished the atonement in the garden wouldn't mate over whether they was lying or cheating or stealing her cussing or running around with women or smoking or gambling or drinking and stuff like that and we know that's not even sin anyway seeing his unbelief see the reason you do those things cause you ain't a believer well brother Dale I've been a Christian a long time and I still smoke what I think you ought to consider it you were to consider it because we're not to draw into our body something that's contrary to God in his word okay come on we're playing this blunt but that's the way I have to be now listen God then before the foundation of the world had already looked down and seen what would take place and His grace had already provided salvation or deliverance for Adam and Eve remember grace brought the atonement into existence the atonement didn't bring grace you're getting backwards here you're messing everything up you got to have the grace first and then the atonement is made for the basis of saving you because that was the atonement made that he knew in his mind we'd do that so he has it ready for us sure he done it before the foundation of the world now what kind of a God do you serve I mean come on if you're gonna believe in a God at least believe in something supernatural well I don't know we're regarding you what I do or not you know be like my daddy was my daddy was picking cotton and him and mom was talking about predestination that's a good old Baptist doctrine all the way back come on it was the Baptist Church was split at one time over two brothers on predestination they say no new thought of predestination but daddy was picking cotton and Mama was explaining to him that God knew everything he turned to her and he said that god no I'm gonna pick that bowl of cotton she said yes he does he went around that bowl of cotton in there would pick he thought he proved the point but he didn't prove no point gotten you what he's gonna do right if we're gonna believe in God let's believe in God if not let's just make him a totem pole you know something you just go out and rub or I hear do whatever I'm not making a lot of religions who do that that's their business I'm just trying to tell you the truth of what I believe about the Word of God the Word of God declares salvation Jonah says is of the Lord so when men fail God had a salvation for him grace provided the product in God sacrificed his own animals for you and many God made the atonement for you and me right there if not how could he care from destroying Adam and Eve now come on is it true now listen sensible you'll see grace is it true that now this is human terminologies and speeches we make right but is it sensible to realize that sin cannot stand in the presence of an Almighty God I mean if your gods that not that kind of a god there's something wrong with your God I'd I'd get rid of him because he just had told him Bowl or some idea at least make him real at least make him the word that he knows and everything making superior to you because if not you of your own God but that's the problem with mankind remember the devil started out with just being Lutton you know that he tried to play around about God but he gets only finally in the Bible he says I'm gonna be like God he was gonna take the place of God that's his idea is that her idea just remember what you think about God is all he can be for you if you don't think he's a healer he can't heal you you don't think he just Savior he can't save you so then what is it the God knew what we do so he had it ready he walked in the garden with Adam and Eve had a wonderful time with him for no telling how long they're worth but then when sin entered the picture it was mandatory that he has to do something now watch my point you agree what I said a moment ago I asked questions ahead of time do you think that God knows everything if you don't you got a problem all right how come God didn't come down and kill Adam and Eve when they send you say you make the tongue come on that secondary now come on they sin before the atonement was made why did he not kill him one split second in the presence of an eternal Almighty God as a sinner without a substitute to take our place is automatic death that's what I was explaining while ago that high priest he went in there if he went in there was some little mark just anything man you think if that was me I wouldn't be telling them I said Moses you make sure that I'm dressed right and I look right and cause if not then I'm dead why didn't he kill Adam and Eve when they sinned I like to ask your questions to make you think you like to hear people who get you rambunctious and running and screaming and hollering I like to get you to think him it's alright with me I like emotions and everything else but I like for you to think I got a lot more scripture back to your thinking as being part of your salvation then I have your emotionals that enough all right so listen why didn't God kill Adam and Eve because grace had already come through now watch what I'm saying the grace the mind that he had the thing that he knew he would do and how that it would finally come to Jesus Christ coming in and dying on the cross you know surely gotten you all of that before the world so he could look all the way through and see grace all the way down and see all the automa all of the things and as he did then he stepped from glory now this son he's still from glory to earth and remember the animals wouldn't killed in heaven okay they was killed in the garden all right are you with me it was in the garden he had to come from glory to earth grace is a person it's not your ideas or mine race is a person it's the person of the Lord Jesus Christ grace is salvation is a person it's not just your thoughts and ideas God Himself stepped out of heaven down upon earth and by looking at them through the eyes of love and the Tollman sin knowing that what he was doing Calvary and everybody he didn't kill him he turned around and said I forgive you you need to prove it he took the skins of the animals and made an atonement so grace was a long ways before the atonement was needed I hope you follow me grace tips how to heaven to pay the price for you and I in the garden you know for mankind all right then he would finally sin our cunning self we know it wouldn't God sin in a son that's where Trinitarian don't add he never sent her son would you send a son to pay your debt well you're a good daddy no he stepped out of glory to earth and he stepped out of glory he stepped up on earth and I love this statement the Prophet said it this way one day and I rejoice he said no matter how bad man has seemed like to be he said God never stayed up in heaven he said he stepped out of heaven and come to earth to fellowship with sinners come on I'll get back to it so don't worry about it you'll see one of these days why brother Branham says they'll be a gospel to the heathen in the Millennium now how is he gonna get there oh come on we're brother Dale you just confused me no no no I'm sorry I'm sorry I can't confuse you I expose your confusion because you don't have an answer for that we are I believe you soldier I don't care what you believe I want the Bible for it I want the Bible why they can be either in the Millennium and be a gospel to it I don't want your idea to mine come on if you listen to the messages we go along you'll find out what that answer is but you try to run ahead and figure it all out you get into a bunch of garbage I'm welcome to pulpit to you to come and explain oh you're sarcastic Oh what are you I don't encourage me or discourage me I'm too old I was born and raised sarcastic and so are you so are you now brother Dale I'm not sarcastic well what is another word for it is any a smaller amount of word we use for sarcastic come on but listen I'm trying to get a point across grace stepped out of heaven and paid the price returning the garden he never died himself he took the animals he took the skins he took the life of the animals why because the animal was the original part of the fall I'm quoting brother branham's we'll come on I don't worry about it when I quote him animal was part of the fall animal would be part of having to make atonement the God would take the blood of that animal but remember that animal never had a soul so he could not come back upon the believer to give him eternal life back that it could only seal him away for a little while listen church which came first in sin or the Saviour eyes will close off and quit on it which came first sin or the Saviour we know the Savior came first we're far enough for you to listen and think about it grace produced the lamb just as Abraham was talking and believe in God right he was getting ready to sacrifice Isaac on the altar and when he did a lamb bladed back behind in the bushes Jehovah Jireh the Lord provided sacrifice he paid the price so then grace came before the atonement they never atonement now you'll understand why brother Owen said grace was before the law in the law knife is law in the atonement was all of grace and applying of that atonement to the lives of mankind is an understanding of grace so you are saved by grace no matter who he is Old Testament come on brothers Old Testament New Testament whoever it is you're saved by grace that not of works as Paul was saying in other words unless anybody should boast about it there's no salvation in do's and dont's makes a good neighbor right would you like to have a company that everybody in that company loved the company and wanted to run the company want to make money would you like to have a company like that sure how about that if you had this about 30-40 guys and they all was good guys and great and wanted to do everything right it'd be great to have a company you go on vacation any time going to you're not to worry about it would you let's see we ain't our lighter weight we're human beings we see grace produced the atonement grace stepped out of glory to earth and mankind and said I'll take care of it so it's not what Adam and Eve done or didn't do that's my point you think it's something you don't or you didn't do I didn't do this that's why God saved me well that's the worst deception you could ever get into when my Bible is full of people that have flaws you can't even find one good guy in the Bible to talk about give me one no Abraham lied this and done that that done that you can't find nobody in that Bible worthy of any salvation no salvation John the Lord I stand together we're gonna go eat together and have a good time fellowship in this is the Thanksgiving message brother Lewis will be preaching the Lord willing Tuesday so will be having services Tuesday night what but just think he came down and skinned those animals to make an atonement so if we started off we started off by thinking everybody older knew by grace are you saved that not of works but don't you think brother Dale order to live good no I don't want you to live good boy you know there's some ease we're talking about one there yesterday that somebody said they mama told him said just steal all you want to we said just don't get caught that's the way the world is right this don't get called that's world's religion but no you're gonna find out one of that heathen why in the world could he ever make it to the millennial reign to here oh gosh play when he's never heard of God he's never heard of Jesus Christ he's never had any contact with a religious Society but yet he'll be there the lot to be safe go ahead what we got well they get two sisters getting the food ready well sang a little bit you have a need y'all doors open remember you saved by grace through faith that not of works lest any man should boast in moments like these I see how the song I sing out of soul love shops appraiser in moments memories I lived my name and getting say and I'm singing I've been condemned because they do name say that once I know you got that's a world language it said I love you you got another language no I promised him years ago we're not raised by hands [Music] I'm not saying to you associated to him so Conny in moments like these I lived I lived [Music] singing you singing in the [Applause] you see [Music] think about him think about what he's done for you just think about what he's done for you but that's why I keep emphasizing think about it personal think about it if they wouldn't a person in the world he would have died for me he would have give his life for me if it wasn't another person in the world you see salvation truly is of the Lord it's not what we do or don't do let's see when it's all finished why can't we say it and right understand it I drank all the liquor I want to I smoked all I want to I love all I want to i teed all I want to because he come and saved me from them he ain't gonna sin and he's living in you and me he ain't gonna sin in us so then he took the woman away and listen church I can stand here and not brave but I can tell you I never did drink smoking this towed it out I never had a point in my mind of lying and cheating and stealing my MCOs I just had a moral obligation as a human being but I had met God in my life but not as a born-again experience but he just crossed my path let me know where he was that I drove out a couple of years ago that's the Lord that's where you come down but said Lord I walked out I left that church I've got 11 years old I got your wall he said wouldn't you left I left we I left we well how can you argue with you but that wasn't south I said that was leading of mankind I'll get to that the products front why did God love Abraham so much when he was not a born-again Christian why would it say that abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness why because he loved God would you love him if he sent you to hell or are you just trying to get out of going could you walk by him and say thank you Lord for what you allowed me to see and do and understand and I deserve hell could you do that if you love God you can because you'll know that he couldn't draw your way he's too much love involved that's why when those children done wrong in the garden he was already there he just stepped out of glory down grace grace stepped out of heaven and just said I'll take care of it I'll kill these animal down take care of it go your way one day this will be a finished product and you'll see grace the greatest message that could ever be the message of grace are they ready a little bit more okay sing some more [Music] I [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah [Music] do you know him as your Savior you got to start from a mental attitude we're gonna get into c-dawg top life you got to start from a mental attitude yeah of thinking about dogs [Music] and gold and into a point that he can raise you up slide and quicken it to you give you a revelation my hand no wonder it means unmerited not something you could do what he's already done see I hope you fathered my point in the mind of God whose not realities Jesus Christ students early on before you know before the world according to the Bible we yet he had to come to earth one day and die to make that a reality that's why there was no salvation back there to give them eternal life because he hadn't come yet he turn alive had not come it was only the grace of God grace the Bible says teaches us to deny ungodliness how about it what do you think about grace one more then we'll go cover it we still get none 4:12 [Music] there's honey in the rock [Music] there's honey in the rod for you oh that's honey
