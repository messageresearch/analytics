[8:47] with them when he get home this evening
[8:49] but I kind of Shar about my experience
[8:51] with my mother and my father as they
[8:53] were getting ill and
[8:55] elderly and that how my faith and what
[8:59] happened to my mother in her faith how
[9:02] God worked where her ankles would be
[9:05] swelled and we would lay hands on her
[9:07] and you watch them immediately go back
[9:10] to normal praying with them and then
[9:14] when I had to make the decision to
[9:16] remove the life support of my father and
[9:17] called brother W and
[9:20] then it was my faith believing that he
[9:23] could rise up but he didn't have that
[9:26] Faith so I'm just sharing with the kids

[21:29] Lord means so much to me amen yes
[21:38] sir Isaiah 35:8 let's bow our heads and
[21:42] go to the
[21:43] Lord Lord God I remember one time when
[21:48] after John the Baptist
[21:49] died Lord you tried to get away and find
[21:53] a secret spot by yourself but the
[21:56] multitudes followed you and you're
[21:59] disciples didn't have anything to feed
[22:01] the multitude that's right so they came
[22:03] to you and said that's Lord we don't
[22:05] have anything to feed the people yes
[22:08] Lord you said you introduced them to the
[22:12] to the food and you began to break the
[22:15] bread and the fishes the Loaves and the
[22:18] fishes for the people and you gave it
[22:20] into your disciples hands to pass it out
[22:23] Lord I pray that you will do the same
[22:26] today for me Lord multiply what I have
[22:29] Lord Jesus and give it something to the
[22:32] people that they can feed Lord and I
[22:34] know that nobody's come here today to be
[22:36] seen or to to see me but we've come to
[22:40] see you and I pray that you'll Open the
[22:42] Eyes of our heart Lord Jesus because in
[22:45] your word you said that only the pure in
[22:47] heart will see you Lord help us Lord
[22:50] that you'll show us the way to be pure
[22:52] in the heart God granted I pray that
[22:54] you'll bless the reading of your word
[22:56] Bless the people today Lord Jesus
[22:58] remember Brother Don and the ones that
[23:00] are sick they couldn't be here Lord God
[23:02] granted I pray that you will be with us
[23:04] this afternoon in the name of the Lord
[23:06] Jesus
[23:07] Christ Isaiah 35:8 says and in the
[23:12] highways shall be there and the way and
[23:15] it shall be called the way of Holiness
[23:18] the unclean shall not pass over it but
[23:21] it shall be for those the wayfaring men
[23:23] the fools shall not he therein amen
[23:29] a way of Holiness that's so simple that
[23:32] the fool shall not air there in exactly
[23:34] and I was thinking before I come up here
[23:37] how did I get up here
[23:42] today
[23:45] amen last Sunday I I on the way home I
[23:48] was talking to my wife about uh the the
[23:52] different things along life Journey that
[23:55] that God you know he he gives you little
[23:57] Clues along long lives way that he's
[24:00] going to might be using you later on
[24:02] down the road one time when I was
[24:04] praying God spoke to me in a certain way
[24:07] and then uh then one day brother Wade
[24:10] out there uh uh outside when I was uh uh
[24:15] helping people get out of their cars and
[24:16] things doing my dickon duties and
[24:18] brother Wade said you going to teach
[24:20] Sunday school next uh Sunday and you
[24:24] know God uh has a wave for each one of
[24:27] us mhm um but there's a way of Holiness
[24:31] too that I want to talk about and only
[24:34] the holy can walk in this way before you
[24:37] can walk in this way you've got to pay a
[24:40] visit to the Fountain that's amen
[24:42] everything all right right than all
[24:45] right I I thought I was too low or
[24:46] something no you're fine okay all right
[24:51] good so Isaiah 358 and uh I was
[24:56] uh thinking about how
[24:59] in nature everything the way that the
[25:02] the earth and the planets orbit the Sun
[25:05] and everything is just ordained of God
[25:07] the Earth is the third planet in the
[25:09] solar system everything moves around in
[25:11] a certain way it has a path that it
[25:13] follows and uh and the the whole solar
[25:17] system moves through the Milky Way and
[25:19] through the whole uh Universe in a
[25:21] certain way that's ordained by God so
[25:23] that the planets don't run into each
[25:25] other and everything just works in a
[25:27] perfect passion and uh then the animals
[25:31] and the the Ducks and the uh they all
[25:34] have their way that they follow and
[25:36] everything moves in a a way and a
[25:38] pattern that God has ordained
[25:40] but uh everything keeps to the way that
[25:44] God has ordained it except for man right
[25:48] and
[25:50] uh because God gave us sorry
[25:59] that's all
[26:01] right
[26:04] just they were tell me we're not to put
[26:06] the whale and Jonah
[26:14] and all right all
[26:17] right
[26:20] wonderful so uh everything has an order
[26:24] and a way that God has ordained except
[26:26] for um except for man and God put us on
[26:30] pre moral agency and before each one of
[26:34] us has presented two ways God's way or
[26:37] our way and the the path that we take in
[26:40] life depends on what way we choose right
[26:42] and I was watching uh uh I don't know if
[26:46] you ever heard of Kirk Cameron and Ray
[26:48] Comfort they do this thing where they go
[26:49] out and witness and a while back they
[26:52] had a a a debate with atheists and um
[26:58] this woman rose up in the audience and
[27:00] she said why is cancer why is there such
[27:03] things in life why do bad things happen
[27:06] to seemingly good people and they were
[27:10] they said well let's go back to the
[27:11] Garden of Eden and talk about what
[27:14] happened in the Garden of Eden but and
[27:15] and she cut them off and she said no I
[27:17] don't want to hear that and that's our
[27:19] problem a lot of times is we want to
[27:21] take our way instead of God's way won't
[27:24] listen to the revealed
[27:26] word and um
[27:28] now the problem you could say the
[27:30] problem started in the Garden of Eden
[27:32] but really the problem started before
[27:33] that the problem started up in heaven
[27:36] when Lucifer the preacher up in heaven
[27:39] began to bring his own ways and said he
[27:42] tried to set him up set himself up above
[27:46] the word of God and said I have a better
[27:50] way and he grew he was such a good
[27:52] preacher and presented in such a
[27:53] wonderful way that he
[27:55] drew a portion of the angels to him
[27:58] that's something to think about he he
[28:00] knew the word so well that he could draw
[28:03] the angels to
[28:06] him and then then he brought the fight
[28:09] down to earth in us and I I was I think
[28:13] about that a lot of times at work how
[28:15] we'll bring in consultants and present
[28:18] you new software something to buy and
[28:20] they present it in a way with with no
[28:23] Foundation they just present a good
[28:25] PowerPoint slide or something but
[28:27] there's no substance and it always
[28:29] boggles me how people uh will will look
[28:31] at these consultants and say well um you
[28:35] got something really good there but hold
[28:37] on a second Let's uh back to the Bible
[28:40] let's compare it with the word and see
[28:43] how it matches up that's right because I
[28:45] might have I I know many times down
[28:48] through my journey I've read God's word
[28:51] and looked in the mirror of his word and
[28:54] reflected back on me and I can see a
[28:56] problem that in my life I've
[28:59] it's not uh not treating people right or
[29:02] different things you know that that
[29:04] doesn't Echo back right so you got to
[29:07] it's got to compare back with God's word
[29:10] that's right so God has put us on a free
[29:12] moral agency to choose either his way or
[29:15] our way right amen and then he Lucifer
[29:19] brought it on down the battle down into
[29:22] the Garden of Eden and he found another
[29:24] preacher in the Garden of Eden the Beast
[29:26] who came to Eve and showed her what she
[29:30] thought was a better way something
[29:32] contrary to God to God's way right and
[29:37] uh she took that Doctrine and brought it
[29:39] into her little home and uh Adam wasn't
[29:43] really being watchful right and uh she
[29:46] brought that Doctrine into their home
[29:48] and you think about it a lot of times uh
[29:50] maybe we bring a little things that are
[29:52] not according to God's word into our
[29:55] home we'll say let's let our children
[29:58] eat of the uh eat of the tree of
[30:01] knowledge of Good and Evil so that later
[30:03] on in life they won't desire it like
[30:05] Les's let's let them play around with
[30:07] smoking little toy cigarettes and things
[30:10] so that later on they won't desire it
[30:12] but the desire those things it's purged
[30:14] by the pillar of fire inside of you the
[30:17] consuming fire the Holy Ghost is not
[30:19] purged by taking of the tree of life and
[30:22] then later on hoping that you won't have
[30:23] a desire keep your house clean keep it
[30:26] San that's the way
[30:29] truth
[30:31] brother and then uh I I just wanted to
[30:33] take a little summary down through the
[30:35] ages of how how the we have just a huge
[30:40] history of a a solid foundation of
[30:43] saints before us that have stood on
[30:45] God's word instead of their own ideas
[30:48] and the first one I want to look at is
[30:50] Enoch who was a seventh from Adam and it
[30:52] said that he walked with God and he was
[30:55] not for God took you because he
[31:00] he had this testimony that he pleased
[31:02] God and he he had a revelation from God
[31:06] Jude wrote about how he saw God coming
[31:09] with 10,000s of saints and and uh he had
[31:13] he had a revelation of this way to walk
[31:15] with God and so he built a monument to
[31:18] this way in Egypt and in this Monument
[31:21] it had been sealed for so many thousands
[31:23] of years and people could not find a way
[31:25] to get into it it was sealed that
[31:28] you couldn't get a razor blade in
[31:30] between any of the ston and that's how
[31:32] much we are seal in Christ that the
[31:34] devil can't find a way to get inside
[31:37] they had to blow open an opening to get
[31:40] inside to find a way with with a
[31:42] dynamite and then when they got inside
[31:44] they found there was three huge stones
[31:46] that sealed away justification
[31:49] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:51] once you are Justified Sanctified
[31:54] baptized with the Holy Ghost then you
[31:56] can start on the way inside those three
[31:59] stones was seven steps 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 up
[32:02] into the king's
[32:05] chamber because you got to be you can't
[32:09] start on this way you can't walk this
[32:11] way of Holiness until you met the
[32:13] fountain and then the next
[32:16] one Enoch um think about in this it's
[32:19] age when Cain went out into the land of
[32:22] no and he began to produce this Satan's
[32:25] evened this economy where everything was
[32:27] working according to Satan's Grand
[32:29] Design which seemed like a good thing
[32:31] and out of all of that that economy God
[32:34] brought these men who were who would
[32:36] stand true to God's word he brought
[32:39] Enoch and then he brought Noah who uh
[32:42] Paul wrote being warn of God of things
[32:45] not seen as yet moved with fear prepared
[32:47] in AR to the saving of his house and I
[32:50] remember in uh and straight As the gate
[32:53] brother B talked about how uh how the he
[32:56] he just marveled at how the word could
[32:58] be presented from behind behind the pool
[33:00] and then people would go and go out in
[33:02] their lives and and you know uh not pump
[33:05] gas on Sunday but on Monday they go back
[33:08] into their filth of things but Noah he
[33:12] he was moved with fear to get his house
[33:14] in order to get everything ready he
[33:15] began working on an arc to save his
[33:18] family and you know uh it was contrary
[33:22] to what everybody else thought would be
[33:25] the right way to do it
[33:28] and but he
[33:31] uh he put aside his own reasonings his
[33:34] own imaginations his own uh looking by
[33:38] his sight and he looked at the things
[33:40] that could not be seen right and he buil
[33:43] an ark while everybody else thought
[33:45] called him crazy right and then he uh he
[33:49] went into the ark and
[33:52] uh God sealed Noah in the ark cuz we
[33:55] can't seal ourselves right God seal
[33:58] sealed him in the ark and waited for him
[34:01] on the other side with a pyramid in the
[34:04] sky a rainbow in the sky saying I'll
[34:07] I'll
[34:08] uh I'll never uh do this again and so
[34:13] with Noah the Earth was
[34:15] justified by water and all of the all of
[34:19] that iniquity all of that stuff that
[34:21] came and set up all of that filth in the
[34:24] world was washed away just like our sins
[34:26] are washed away by justification that's
[34:29] right and then
[34:31] Abraham who uh after Noah they they uh
[34:36] men began to prosper in the earth and
[34:37] they built the Tower of baby and set up
[34:40] tried to uh if if they they were
[34:42] thinking in their heart if another flood
[34:43] were to come then uh we'll Escape by our
[34:47] own by our own workers and they
[34:51] uh they built that Tower of Babel and
[34:53] then God caused their their uh Speech to
[34:56] be confused dispersed into the different
[34:59] parts of the world and Abraham was
[35:01] coming down from the Fertile Crescent
[35:04] with his with his family and God spoke
[35:06] to him and said uh don't go this way go
[35:09] that way that's how repentance is you
[35:11] turn around you get to turn around you
[35:14] can't keep going
[35:15] on and when he was called he was called
[35:18] out and he began to look for a city in a
[35:21] Strange Land not knowing where it went
[35:24] and you remember brother R talked about
[35:25] how you can't see if you can't see this
[35:28] the path in front of you just go hold
[35:30] that light out in front of you the light
[35:31] of God's word and take one step at a
[35:33] time and that's how you do it you know
[35:35] en walked with God for 365 years the uh
[35:39] brother Wade was talking at Sunday
[35:40] school this morning about the T toris in
[35:42] the hair the slow and steady wins the
[35:45] race it's slow and steady and consistent
[35:47] that's right that's that's what wins a
[35:50] race a life
[35:51] live and
[35:53] uh Abraham God uh through through
[35:58] Abraham's life he showed the this way
[36:00] that Isaiah was talking about
[36:02] justification sanctification in Genesis
[36:05] 12 and he was called out and God uh
[36:07] pointed him in a different direction
[36:09] said go this way down into Canaan he
[36:11] justified him and then in Genesis 15 he
[36:14] Sanctified and when by he offered a
[36:17] sacrifice to God and God showed him that
[36:19] vision of horror great Darkness the
[36:21] smoking furnace the burning lamp and
[36:24] Sanctified him and then in Genesis 17 he
[36:26] said
[36:30] let me read
[36:37] it Genesis
[36:42] 17 walk before me yes
[36:45] right that's
[36:49] right there it is I am the almighty God
[36:53] walk before me and be thou
[36:56] perfectly the for the baptism of the
[36:58] Holy Ghost walk before me because you
[37:02] can't walk this holy way until you've
[37:04] been filled with the Holy Ghost you'll
[37:06] stumble and fall you'll have ups and
[37:08] downs you'll uh trip and and we we still
[37:11] stumble and have troubles and things but
[37:13] the the uh oh we'll get into
[37:16] it and uh so through Abraham's life he
[37:21] showed the path that we take
[37:23] righten and the uh God revealed himself
[37:28] self to Abraham because and when those
[37:32] those three men went to down into met
[37:36] Abraham and then the two rose up right
[37:38] and went down into Sodom and Abraham
[37:41] went with him to bringing them on the
[37:42] way and the Lord said shall I hide from
[37:44] Abraham that thing which I do right and
[37:47] why was he going to reveal to Abraham
[37:50] the secrets why was he going to reveal
[37:52] it because he knew that he would keep
[37:54] the way of the Lord for I know him that
[37:57] he will man his children and his
[37:58] household after him and they shall keep
[38:00] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[38:03] judgment that the Lord may bring upon
[38:05] Abraham that which he said has spoken of
[38:07] him yep and Sarah you know it's it's
[38:10] written in the in the Old Testament you
[38:12] know uh she laughed in the 10 and so
[38:15] forth but in the New Testament Paul
[38:17] wrote of her she received strength to
[38:20] conceive seed because she judged him
[38:23] faithful who had promised she didn't
[38:26] have she didn't have any child but uh
[38:29] she brought forth Isaac the promised the
[38:31] promised son as though one from the dead
[38:34] that's right and then uh Hebrews 11:1
[38:37] 13:16 says now there here's the here's
[38:40] the key these all died in faith not
[38:43] having received the promises but having
[38:44] seen them AAR off and were persuaded of
[38:46] them and embraced them and confessed
[38:48] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[38:50] the Earth right for they that say such
[38:52] things declare plainly that they seek a
[38:54] country and truly if they had been
[38:56] mindful of that country from which they
[38:58] came out they might have had opportunity
[39:00] to have returned but that's the key they
[39:02] weren't mindful of that place that they
[39:04] came out like the Lost wife that when
[39:06] she came out she turned back and was
[39:08] turned into salt she they weren't
[39:10] mindful of where they' come out so they
[39:12] had no they had no problem with leaving
[39:14] right they were uh once they hit that
[39:16] road they were
[39:18] gone and uh then Abraham offered Isaac
[39:22] brother brand said type justification
[39:25] believing in a resurrection and then we
[39:27] get on down to Jacob who gave up
[39:30] everything for the birth right right
[39:32] right he gave up everything for the
[39:34] birth right and then moved on to uh get
[39:36] the father's blessings and a lot of
[39:38] times down the road you'll see people
[39:41] stop at sanctification and say well I'm
[39:43] I'm living a Godly life I'm going to
[39:45] church I've got the father's blessings
[39:47] on me but later on down the road he met
[39:51] the angel of the Lord that touched him
[39:52] in his hip and cus him to walk different
[39:55] when you meet the angel of God it'll
[39:57] call you to
[39:59] walk am exctly and then Joseph
[40:07] Prof Joseph was you know he was his he
[40:12] he had a he God gave him visions and
[40:14] caus him to be different and his his
[40:16] brother because of that they hated him
[40:18] they thought he was trying to put
[40:19] himself up on a pedestal yeah right but
[40:22] all he was doing was just telling the
[40:23] word telling the truth one day you'll
[40:27] bow down to me my goodness you uh you
[40:30] trying to make something of yourself so
[40:31] they took him down into Egypt uh th
[40:34] threw him in a well so sold him off into
[40:36] Egypt and God delivered them by his hand
[40:40] now Joseph had to make a choice too when
[40:42] they poer was gone doing work and and
[40:45] Piper's wife was out and and and she she
[40:48] gave Joseph a choice to either take
[40:52] God's way or his way and Joseph ran from
[40:56] her right so fast that she was all she
[40:58] was left with was a little piece of
[41:00] garment in his hand in her hand right
[41:02] and
[41:03] uh my if we could run from the from our
[41:05] own ideas and our flesh and everything
[41:08] that quickly that we' have something
[41:11] there and then Moses when he was
[41:14] born he uh a pharaoh rose up that didn't
[41:18] know Moses and when he was born he was
[41:21] hid for 3 months by his parents now they
[41:25] saw something different in Moses they
[41:27] had a revelation from God and they when
[41:29] all around them the people were uh the
[41:33] the the Egyptian uh Army was killing
[41:35] these little babies they they knew they
[41:38] got a revelation that if they hung on to
[41:40] this little baby that they were going to
[41:42] lose him so they let him go that's if
[41:45] you lose your soul you'll save it by the
[41:48] gospel if you give it away you'll save
[41:51] it give it to God if you keep it if you
[41:53] keep your soul to yourself and try to
[41:54] polish it off with your own doctrin
[41:57] ideas things then you'll lose it sure as
[42:01] anything by faith Moses when he was come
[42:04] to years Paul said refused to be called
[42:07] the son of Pharaoh's daughter so when he
[42:09] got old enough he was like I'm not I'm
[42:11] not uh I'm not standing with this I
[42:14] can't stand in my denomination anymore
[42:16] I'm going to have to go out and he went
[42:18] and of course he tried to take his own
[42:21] way about killing the Egyptian the next
[42:23] day they uh they said what uh are you
[42:26] going to do the same thing to us and ran
[42:28] off into the Wilderness where he met the
[42:30] pillar of fire and God put him on the
[42:32] right way and then he turned back to
[42:35] Egypt brought 10 plagues that combed the
[42:38] the the all the different gods of Egypt
[42:41] and showed Pharaoh that I this is that
[42:44] you're wrong and the Israelites showed
[42:46] them that you're right by the 10 plagues
[42:50] and the last plague was against against
[42:52] Pharaoh himself you call yourself God
[42:55] well let's let's see and the last
[42:59] plague was death to the firstborn and uh
[43:02] so the children of Israel before they
[43:04] crossed the Red Sea they had to be
[43:06] covered by the blood amen they went in
[43:09] to the little uh into the little homes
[43:12] and maybe one of the little children
[43:14] would look up and say Daddy are you sure
[43:16] this is the right way and I remember
[43:19] growing up I had a A Moment Like That
[43:22] where uh you know you you've heard about
[43:25] I heard about the message since since I
[43:28] was as as far back as I can remember
[43:31] every night growing up we were raised in
[43:33] a an atmosphere every night growing up
[43:36] we had devotionals every single night I
[43:38] don't remember ever when whether we were
[43:39] on vacation or anything we were always
[43:42] talking about the Lord and and and
[43:44] creating that atmosphere around it but
[43:46] one day I I remember going into my dad's
[43:49] study where he had a little a little
[43:51] thing on the wall with the pillar fire
[43:53] and the different
[43:55] uh uh pictures of of brother Brown and
[43:58] the things that had happened in his life
[44:00] and I looked at that Pillar of Fire and
[44:02] I thought you know this is this true you
[44:04] got to have a uh you you can't just say
[44:07] I I believe it you got to be anchored so
[44:10] much said he believ it but you got to
[44:14] know that you know amen and I I looked
[44:16] at that Pillar of Fire and I thought I
[44:18] know that this this couldn't have been
[44:21] fake that there is a God that's why I
[44:24] like to have the pillar of fire in my
[44:25] home because it's uh it's a uh a
[44:29] testimony that the message that we
[44:31] follow is true that this word that we
[44:33] believe is the true was sent by God and
[44:38] you can put your faith in that so they
[44:39] were covered by the blood and then they
[44:41] had the pillar of fire going before them
[44:44] and and then they cross the Red Sea said
[44:47] the pillar of fire Scar the Red Sea back
[44:50] now brother uh and uh Brother Anderson
[44:52] go ahead and put that picture of the the
[44:54] Red Sea Crossing up cuz I want to think
[44:57] think about what we're we're looking at
[44:59] Isaiah
[45:04] 35 away in the middle of the highway
[45:08] right now brother brand said you get too
[45:11] far to the right and you get all starchy
[45:13] and you think well I'm I'm saved because
[45:15] how how much I know and different things
[45:17] like that you get too much over to the
[45:19] other side you got get bogg down in
[45:22] fanaticism and get blown whichever way
[45:25] the wind blows you'll go to different do
[45:28] if you stay right in the middle of the
[45:29] way and keep your eye on Christ like
[45:32] Moses when when they were getting over
[45:33] to the other side he went up and stood
[45:35] on the Rock so they could keep their eye
[45:36] on him keep your eye on Christ and you
[45:38] will finish the journey
[45:40] amen right he he gave us a way of
[45:44] Holiness but before they could get on
[45:46] that way they had to go they had to
[45:48] believe that Moses was the deliverer
[45:50] right they had to believe it and then
[45:52] they had to be covered by the blood and
[45:54] then they had to be led by the pillar of
[45:56] Fire P fire
[45:58] experience and then as they journeyed
[46:01] through the Wilderness they came in many
[46:03] different many different along life
[46:05] Journey you have a little Milestones
[46:07] along the way think about how uh just
[46:10] looking at your life you
[46:13] uh you maybe you graduate from school
[46:16] and then you uh get you get married and
[46:19] you start raising your kids and and all
[46:21] these different Milestones I remember
[46:24] reading about John Wesley's father he he
[46:27] gathered his family around and he was as
[46:28] he was lying on his bed and he said I'm
[46:31] so thankful that I have this Blessed
[46:32] assurance that all of my family has been
[46:35] saved and we have a Blessed Assurance as
[46:38] life comes to a close maybe in our life
[46:40] and
[46:42] uh God has led us along so that even
[46:46] though things around us may look Bleak
[46:48] and dim we have a Blessed assurance that
[46:51] we're saved in him
[46:52] amen that's right amen and uh then
[46:57] as they journeyed along they got to the
[46:59] the uh Mar the bitter Waters and
[47:03] sometimes you maybe you came to a place
[47:05] where you you put all your hopes and
[47:07] Trust into a minister or something and
[47:10] they fell by the wayside and I know so
[47:13] many stories of people that have put
[47:15] their trust into a Ministry or or into
[47:18] somebody and then something happened
[47:20] bitter water and uh or or sickness and
[47:24] problems like that lady was asking why
[47:26] the things bad things happen to good
[47:28] people but they stopped in the bitter
[47:30] Waters there was plenty of water that
[47:32] was more than enough for them to drink
[47:35] but they couldn't it was bitter they
[47:38] couldn't drink it but they found out
[47:40] that the answer was right next to the
[47:42] water and they put the tree Moses put
[47:45] the tree into the water and it was made
[47:47] the water pure and then
[47:50] uh the children of Israel journeyed to
[47:54] the kades barnea where they were
[47:56] presented with that great choice that
[47:58] they turned down and
[48:00] now I just want to point this out all
[48:04] these different Journeys lot there was
[48:07] only three saved out of out of Sodom and
[48:10] gomorra Noah was only eight save and
[48:14] when they came to kardes barnia there
[48:15] was only two Joshua and Caleb and of
[48:19] course Moses just three that believe
[48:21] that they could go over and how it's so
[48:25] few that really truly can walk in this
[48:28] way I heard I was listening last night
[48:30] as straight as a gate and brother random
[48:32] said that he doubted if they would only
[48:34] be 12 out of this generation that's such
[48:37] a hard thing to imagine 12 but it makes
[48:41] me want to go try so much harder this
[48:45] pridee it's not something that's out of
[48:47] your reach cuz he said whosoever will
[48:49] the problem is that we don't want it not
[48:52] we me but so many don't want it and
[48:55] that's the problem with uh
[48:57] that we have to overcome is we'd rather
[48:59] take our way than God's
[49:01] way we all have that choice our way
[49:04] right or God's way right and uh so then
[49:07] the children of Israel they began as as
[49:10] they began to walk in lock stop step and
[49:12] harmony with God's word when they got to
[49:15] the to the Jordan River they were
[49:17] walking in such harmony with God's word
[49:19] till God spoke to Joshua and said tell
[49:21] them sanctify yourselves for I will do
[49:24] wonders and they Sanctified themselves
[49:26] for the for the Jordan River Crossing
[49:28] and they crossed over and Rahab was
[49:30] looking out and she saw by this time the
[49:33] pillar of fire had been veiled in the
[49:35] Tabernacle until the New Testament that
[49:38] was hidden inside those batter skins she
[49:40] couldn't see that but she knew these
[49:42] people were walking they were led by
[49:44] something that she had never seen
[49:46] before and as they crossed the Jordan
[49:48] River
[49:50] something uh was something was pricked
[49:53] in her heart and she said I I would like
[49:56] some of that
[49:57] those people that's how that's how it is
[50:00] when uh when someone sees the real
[50:03] gospel being live that preaches a
[50:05] greater sermon than anything any any
[50:07] Ministry could preach right it's uh far
[50:10] louder and uh so Rahab that she hid the
[50:15] two two spies and hung out the token
[50:17] outside of her window and her whole
[50:19] house was
[50:20] saved and then on down to the last one
[50:24] that I want to talk about before we get
[50:26] into some study is is
[50:30] Jesus and
[50:32] Jesus was born and a away that people
[50:36] couldn't couldn't understand why was he
[50:39] the the king of glory the uh Lord of
[50:42] Lord's came and was born in a little
[50:44] manger
[50:46] right and think about his adolescence
[50:50] and how he was as he grew up it was
[50:52] Elohim veiled in flesh veiled from their
[50:55] eyes the god of Glory was right there in
[50:59] their midst and they couldn't see it and
[51:01] you know I've heard it presented before
[51:02] that that maybe Jesus when he was
[51:04] younger would uh maybe act like a lot of
[51:08] other kids and might have you know
[51:10] stolen from the cookie jar and then lied
[51:12] to his mama I don't see it that way
[51:15] because if he lied to his mama he's
[51:17] yielding to the that five gates of the
[51:20] outer core he's yielding to his flesh to
[51:22] his flesh just like Eve did but the
[51:25] pillar of Fire was inside of him the
[51:27] same fire that L out ofp was in him from
[51:32] the day he was born to the day he
[51:36] died that's what I believe and uh so I
[51:41] want to look at his disciples one day
[51:43] they asked him this question so I want
[51:46] to look Brothers if you bring up John
[51:49] chapter
[51:50] 14 and I'm going to read from the
[51:54] DI amen
[51:57] cuz this way it took them out of Egypt
[52:00] yeah the the way of Holiness took them
[52:02] out of Egypt that's right but it also
[52:04] takes us in right to him in John 14
[52:09] verse 1 says let let not your heart be
[52:12] troubled I'm reading from the emphatic
[52:14] diaglog so it's going to be yall read
[52:16] from there and I'll read from there let
[52:18] not your heart be troubled believe into
[52:21] God and believe into me yeah in my
[52:24] father's house are many dwellings but if
[52:27] not I would have told you because I'm
[52:29] going to prepare a place for you and if
[52:31] I go and prepare a place for you I am
[52:34] coming again and will receive you to
[52:36] myself so that where I am you also may
[52:38] be and where I am going you know the way
[52:41] GL thas says to him Lord we know not
[52:44] where thou art going how do we know the
[52:46] way yeah Jesus says to him I am the way
[52:50] and the truth in your life no one comes
[52:52] to the father except by me if you had
[52:55] known me you would have known my father
[52:57] and from this time you know him and have
[52:59] seen him so this way of Holiness takes
[53:02] us out of all our own ideas all our own
[53:06] senses and everything it takes us into
[53:08] him right takes us into his life and at
[53:12] the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus was
[53:14] presented with a choice too to take
[53:17] God's way or to take uh a different way
[53:20] and he said father let this cup pass for
[53:22] me but nevertheless not my will but
[53:25] thine be done
[53:26] and he went to the Cross where he was
[53:28] pierced in the side and by the Roman
[53:31] soldiers and out from his side came
[53:33] water and blood and then he tilted his
[53:35] head back and said it is finished and
[53:37] gave up The Ghost and out came spirit
[53:40] and there's the way back to him the way
[53:42] to the way of Holiness is to be
[53:44] justified Sanctified and F with the
[53:47] spirit and then you can walk in the
[53:50] way
[53:52] Romans Romans 8:29 and3 says now here's
[53:57] our
[53:59] uh here's our confidence when you take
[54:02] your first step onto the way yeah for
[54:06] whom he did Forno he also did
[54:08] predestinate to be conformed to the
[54:10] image of his son that he might be the
[54:12] firstborn among many brothers that's
[54:14] right moreover whom he did predestinate
[54:17] them he also called and whom he called
[54:19] them he also Justified and whom he
[54:21] justified them he also glorified what
[54:24] shall we then say to these things if God
[54:26] before us who can be against us cuz if
[54:29] God forew that you would want it he's
[54:32] already glorified you all you have to do
[54:34] is stay in the way and put one foot in
[54:36] front of the other that's here you have
[54:38] met your journey but what's the goal
[54:41] what's the end of the journeys to see
[54:44] God and uh so I I wanted to present this
[54:48] way this this
[54:50] journey as a journey through the
[54:53] Tabernacle and uh I had this book by
[54:57] this man named Alfred edine that talks
[54:59] about the layout of the temple and how
[55:01] there's lots of gates at Solomon's
[55:03] Temple but the Levites only guarded five
[55:05] gates they guarded five gates on the
[55:08] outside and then five gates on the in
[55:10] the inner court and then one gate before
[55:12] the holy of holies so as you're as
[55:15] you're going taking this journey up the
[55:18] steps to the way you have to you have to
[55:21] go through each of these Gates the five
[55:24] gates on the outside the five gates in
[55:26] the middle and and then that one gate to
[55:29] the inner sense that governs your whole
[55:31] body exactly and our problem is that we
[55:34] get offended along the way we get our
[55:37] our uh we look at things with our
[55:39] natural eyes and we can't see the way
[55:41] that God does it and we uh that that's a
[55:44] problem is to look past like Abraham
[55:46] counted the things that he saw as though
[55:48] they were not amen and uh in Romans
[55:53] uh 9:32 he said wherefore for because
[55:57] they sought it not by faith but as it
[55:59] were by The Works of the law for they
[56:01] stumbled at that stumbling Stone as it
[56:03] is written behold I lay in Zion a
[56:05] stumbling stone and rock of a fence and
[56:08] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[56:11] ashamed and we stumble uh many times
[56:15] along this journey stumble at the way
[56:17] God does it at at the different things
[56:20] that we uh come across in this journey
[56:23] right now the the Jews stumbled JW Jesus
[56:27] had his parentage they said at at his
[56:31] birth at his place of birth they thought
[56:34] he was born in Galilee and he never
[56:37] corrected him he said now hold on let me
[56:38] explain
[56:40] this I was born I really was born in
[56:43] Bethlehem but they thought aren't isn't
[56:46] the Messiah supposed to come from
[56:47] Bethlehem Judea and uh he which he
[56:51] really did come from of course and then
[56:54] they were offended at his appearance he
[56:56] looked they were looking at those outer
[56:58] five gates they looked at him he's not a
[57:00] man that we said should desire and he
[57:03] looked he looked uh maybe not polished
[57:06] up and fancied up with a fancy suit on
[57:10] like Lucifer back there in heaven looked
[57:12] up and he and and he drew all the angel
[57:15] that portion of angels to him when
[57:17] Lucifer was doing his preaching but uh
[57:21] and then they were offended at his lack
[57:23] of Education what he did for a living
[57:27] and the company he kept he kept he kept
[57:30] company with the publicans and the
[57:31] Sinners and the poor and then along life
[57:35] way along the way they began to be more
[57:38] and more offended at his doctrines as he
[57:41] progressed from the first pool to the
[57:42] third pool right and they were offended
[57:46] at that he healed on the sabath sure
[57:50] right they couldn't understand I see a
[57:53] lot of times we we have our own ideas
[57:55] why are you heal on the Sabbath they had
[57:57] their own ideas but if they would would
[57:59] have stopped looking through the the
[58:01] veils of their flesh and the veil of
[58:03] their spirit and looked at God's word
[58:06] they would have seen that he was right
[58:07] in
[58:08] line they were offended because he
[58:12] collected Grain on the Sabbath and Jesus
[58:14] told him don't you know that David ate
[58:17] shoe bread and was found blameless don't
[58:21] you know that the priest profaned the
[58:23] Sabbath and are found blameless he was
[58:26] proven to him that he was opening up the
[58:28] scripture to them to prove that they
[58:30] didn't know what they were talking about
[58:32] instead of going back to God's word and
[58:33] basically on that they were basically on
[58:35] some on their imagination on things that
[58:38] they thought were true but they're not
[58:40] and then they were offended because
[58:43] Jesus and his disciples ate without
[58:45] washing their hands oh yeah and I I
[58:49] think how so many times we get offended
[58:51] at little
[58:53] uh you know we know uh
[58:56] you know people that won't go to a
[58:58] church that's 2 miles down the road
[59:00] because they have like a brick just to
[59:02] illustrate a brick between the church
[59:04] and the fellowship hall shame on you for
[59:06] having a fellowship hall that's
[59:08] connected by a brick to your church and
[59:11] the word might be coming forth from the
[59:12] pulpit but they won't go there we get
[59:15] offended at these little things and then
[59:17] John the Baptist
[59:19] disciples thank you brother you got some
[59:23] more sorry about that John the Baptist
[59:26] disciples were also offended they were
[59:28] offended because Jesus and his disciples
[59:31] didn't fast and Jesus told them how can
[59:33] you fast when when the word is right
[59:36] when the word is taken away you long to
[59:38] be closer to God and you want to get rid
[59:41] of those five senses so you you fast to
[59:44] to give way to the Holy Spirit right and
[59:47] they were offended because maybe they
[59:48] didn't live and as off steer life was
[59:51] their as their Master they were offended
[59:54] because they didn't really understand
[59:55] Jesus was talking about this Kingdom
[59:58] that uh we must was must first be in us
[1:00:00] before we would be in it in the natural
[1:00:03] they didn't
[1:00:05] understand and then
[1:00:08] uh just
[1:00:15] along they
[1:00:17] were and everyone was offended as they
[1:00:21] looked at John the Baptist lack of
[1:00:23] education and then today look how
[1:00:26] brother brandom didn't use proper words
[1:00:28] and his proper speech oh yeah right now
[1:00:31] you would he would say you know
[1:00:33] sometimes when the anointing would hit
[1:00:35] and he would say that do you believe
[1:00:37] that I am a prophet oh my just like when
[1:00:39] they looked at Joseph and said
[1:00:42] uh when Joseph told his brothers you the
[1:00:46] prophecy they looked at him you trying
[1:00:47] to make something of yourself but when
[1:00:49] really he was telling them the
[1:00:51] truth and you know they they got
[1:00:54] offended because of Elisha had a bald
[1:00:57] head and now they're getting offended
[1:00:59] because they don't understand when
[1:01:02] brother brandham was out west before the
[1:01:04] cloud appeared in the sky and they say
[1:01:07] that's not true they got offended at
[1:01:09] Noah three pools right they got offended
[1:01:12] when Jesus they everything was fine when
[1:01:15] he was Healing The Sick but then when he
[1:01:16] began to call out the secrets of their
[1:01:18] heart and say you got to be pure before
[1:01:21] the uping of the word can come you got
[1:01:23] to be get all that stuff out of your
[1:01:25] life before the word can be be revealed
[1:01:28] they begin to be offended and the same
[1:01:29] thing with brother Rand when he began to
[1:01:31] preach and open the word and then people
[1:01:34] began to be offended think about those
[1:01:36] prayer lines that that fool all the way
[1:01:38] to the back of the church but then when
[1:01:40] he began to call out the secrets of
[1:01:42] their hearts you committed adultery and
[1:01:44] things it started to thin out a little
[1:01:46] bit we maybe we don't want that now
[1:01:49] maybe we don't want to live a clean life
[1:01:51] a clean Godly Sanctified life but you
[1:01:54] got to live a San life before the word
[1:01:57] can come the third pool the opening of
[1:01:59] the word and maybe Joseph was offended
[1:02:03] about the blessing of Ephraim and
[1:02:06] manasse and uh think about
[1:02:11] uh pleas oh just going through the the
[1:02:15] five courts we look at our own memory
[1:02:18] and our own reason instead right of the
[1:02:21] word of
[1:02:22] God and then uh I want to let's look at
[1:02:26] Genesis
[1:02:29] 3 because uh we look at our own our own
[1:02:34] senses instead
[1:02:37] of instead of God's
[1:02:39] word and that that's not God's way right
[1:02:43] that's our way right and as as we read
[1:02:48] through Genesis chter 3 just take note
[1:02:51] of how it it was presented how the
[1:02:54] language that was used right sensory
[1:02:57] language now the serpent was more subtle
[1:03:00] than any beast of the field which the
[1:03:01] Lord God had made and he said unto the
[1:03:03] woman yeah God said ye shall not eat of
[1:03:07] every tree of the garden and the woman
[1:03:09] said unto the serpent we may eat of the
[1:03:11] fruit of the Trees of the garden but of
[1:03:13] the fruit of the tree which is in the
[1:03:15] midst of the garden God that said ye
[1:03:17] shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[1:03:19] touch it lest you die and the serpent
[1:03:22] said unto the woman ye shall not surely
[1:03:24] die but God know than the day you eat
[1:03:27] thereof then your eyes shall be open and
[1:03:30] you shall be as God knowing good and
[1:03:32] evil and the woman saw that the tree was
[1:03:35] good for food and that it was pleasant
[1:03:37] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[1:03:39] make one wise she took of the fruit
[1:03:40] thereof and it eat and gave also unto
[1:03:43] her husband with her and he did eat and
[1:03:45] the eyes of them both were open and they
[1:03:47] knew that they were naked and they seed
[1:03:49] fig leaves together and made themselves
[1:03:51] aprons
[1:03:53] so this the the the problem that Eve had
[1:03:56] was she was looking by her five senses
[1:03:59] instead of looking she was she was
[1:04:01] honoring her five senses instead of
[1:04:02] looking at God's word and let's Journey
[1:04:05] on in a little deeper next to the next
[1:04:07] five gates
[1:04:10] affection brother brand was I have a
[1:04:14] note about 1 Corinthians 13 about
[1:04:17] how Paul was talking about how if you
[1:04:20] give your body to be burned give all my
[1:04:22] goods to the poor all these different
[1:04:24] things but still you don't have love
[1:04:26] then you can have when the Holy Ghost
[1:04:29] comes into your life he changes your
[1:04:31] affections from the affection of this
[1:04:33] world to the affection of God you start
[1:04:35] Desiring different things your affection
[1:04:38] becomes
[1:04:41] changed and then
[1:04:44] imagination a memory memory is you
[1:04:48] memory will stumble you a lot of times
[1:04:50] you as you're taking that Journey along
[1:04:52] you'll think you look back to somebody
[1:04:54] that you knew that did such such a and
[1:04:56] you it hinders you you think well this
[1:04:58] minister or something wasn't living a
[1:05:00] Godly life so maybe it's not true what
[1:05:02] they're saying or you remember all the
[1:05:05] past things you did in your life and it
[1:05:07] stumbles you you think maybe I can't be
[1:05:10] saved but uh put aside all of those
[1:05:13] things and look at God's word he said
[1:05:16] whosoever will let him
[1:05:19] come and the the three p God's drawing
[1:05:22] us through these five gates to draw us
[1:05:25] to the world so that his word can be
[1:05:26] manifested to
[1:05:31] us let's see and then uh uh just uh
[1:05:35] finishing up over the next few minutes I
[1:05:38] want to tell this little story of how
[1:05:41] just jump back to the Garden of Eden how
[1:05:44] when Cain and Abel came
[1:05:46] out of the
[1:05:49] garden when they were standing looking
[1:05:52] God had set up an altar in the Eastward
[1:05:54] of Eden
[1:05:56] and uh surrounded it guarded it by
[1:05:58] cherubs MH to keep man from the way back
[1:06:03] see it right until it was covered by
[1:06:05] Blood right
[1:06:08] right and the altar is in man's heart
[1:06:12] there was a substitutionary altar
[1:06:14] waiting in the Garden of Eden for
[1:06:17] something for for the offering that Cain
[1:06:20] and Abel could bring and Cain you know
[1:06:24] he brought an offering of what he
[1:06:26] thought it was because Adam and Eve told
[1:06:29] Cain and Abel that it uh they they hid
[1:06:33] from it was a mystery they hid from they
[1:06:35] hid from their children what really
[1:06:37] happened in the garden of oh
[1:06:39] my and so Cain thought well I all I know
[1:06:43] is it was a fruit and they ate something
[1:06:45] so I'm a farmer I'm going to bring what
[1:06:49] all I know about it and and surely God
[1:06:51] will accept my Revelation by my five
[1:06:55] senses and my five spiritual senses my
[1:06:59] reason my conscience my affection I I
[1:07:03] love God he he had a natural that kind
[1:07:06] of affection you know he was a a a
[1:07:09] Believer as far as going to church and
[1:07:11] doing things right but Abel on the other
[1:07:15] hand had a revelation that God revealed
[1:07:18] him and brother R said he looked all the
[1:07:20] way down and saw that one day God was
[1:07:22] going to send God was going to come
[1:07:24] himself and lay his life so that we can
[1:07:27] come back and
[1:07:30] so Abel goes out and maybe one day he
[1:07:34] was out about and and just I I don't
[1:07:37] know how what the process that this
[1:07:39] Revelation came by maybe one day he was
[1:07:41] watching a little lamb be born and he
[1:07:43] saw the water and the blood and the
[1:07:45] spirit and he and he said I I see
[1:07:47] something in that but he by Revelation
[1:07:52] he took an offering he he took that
[1:07:55] Little Lamb's life and laid it down on
[1:07:57] the altar MH y That's and Cain looked at
[1:08:01] that and said My Five Senses don't agree
[1:08:04] with that and uh right right and uh you
[1:08:09] know thought thought that he was crazy
[1:08:12] yeah and
[1:08:15] uh but uh AEL AEL went through those
[1:08:19] those two stages you know first before
[1:08:22] you can be Sanctified you you must be
[1:08:24] covered by the blood justification to
[1:08:26] believe sanctification and then he he
[1:08:28] laid it on the Altar and he waited
[1:08:32] right now how is Abel going to how is
[1:08:36] God going to accept Abel's sacrifice
[1:08:39] it's the same way that he accepts our
[1:08:41] sacrifice right and uh
[1:08:45] exactly Cain brought his offering up
[1:08:48] there and when God accepted Abel's
[1:08:50] sacrifice he was all upset right he
[1:08:54] couldn't believe that he would accept
[1:08:55] right a sa a sacrifice that was brought
[1:08:58] by faith instead of a sacrifice brought
[1:09:00] by the senses amen
[1:09:06] right so let's look at how God accepts
[1:09:10] sacrifices in Romans
[1:09:13] 12 verse 1-
[1:09:18] 2 how he accepts your sacrifice and he
[1:09:21] said Abel laid himself on the offer of
[1:09:24] sacrifice
[1:09:27] not not literally but you know that's
[1:09:32] right he because he was identified with
[1:09:35] his
[1:09:40] sacrifice Romans 12 1 and 2 I beseech
[1:09:44] you therefore Brethren by the mercies of
[1:09:46] God that you present your bodies a
[1:09:47] Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[1:09:51] God which is your reasonable service
[1:09:52] amen and be not conformed to this world
[1:09:54] what be transformed by the renewing of
[1:09:56] your mind that you may prove what is
[1:09:58] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:10:02] will of God Amen
[1:10:04] right and then Matthew
[1:10:09] 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water
[1:10:11] under repentance but he that cometh
[1:10:14] after me is mightier than I whose shoes
[1:10:16] I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize
[1:10:19] you with the Holy Ghost and with fire
[1:10:22] amen and then we remember Elijah
[1:10:24] sacrifice first king 18:22
[1:10:26] to39 then said Elijah unto the people I
[1:10:30] even I only remain a prophet of the Lord
[1:10:33] but baal's prophets are 450 Men Let Them
[1:10:36] therefore give us two Bullocks and let
[1:10:37] them choose one bullet for themselves
[1:10:39] and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood
[1:10:41] and put no fire under and I will dress
[1:10:44] the other bulock and lay it on wood and
[1:10:45] put no fire under and call ye on the
[1:10:48] name of your gods and I will call on the
[1:10:49] name of the Lord and the god that answer
[1:10:52] by fire let him be God amen amen and all
[1:10:55] the people answered and said it is well
[1:10:57] spoken we know what happened there and
[1:10:59] then Moses sacrificed in the wilderness
[1:11:01] the first time that Moses offered it and
[1:11:04] Leviticus
[1:11:05] 9:23
[1:11:06] 24 and Moses and Aaron went into the
[1:11:09] Tabernacle of the congregation MH and
[1:11:13] came out and blessed the people and the
[1:11:15] glory of the Lord appeared unto all the
[1:11:17] people and there came a fire out from
[1:11:19] before the Lord and consumed upon the
[1:11:21] altar the burnt offering and the fat
[1:11:23] which when all the people saw the
[1:11:25] shouted and fell on their faces right
[1:11:27] and then judge at 6:21 when Gideon's
[1:11:30] sacrifice was consumed right then the
[1:11:32] angel of the Lord put forth the end of
[1:11:34] the staff that was in his hand and
[1:11:36] touched the Flesh and the unleavened
[1:11:37] cakes and There Rose up fire out of the
[1:11:39] Rock and consumed the Flesh in in the
[1:11:41] unleavened cakes then the angel of the
[1:11:43] Lord departed out of his sight what
