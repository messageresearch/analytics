[1:08] lot younger than
[1:11] that Joyce now with the other hand look
[1:14] out patience with God remember yeah
[1:17] patience patience with the
[1:19] people
[1:20] so yeah we're 54 now
[1:23] so I um the other day I was
[1:27] thinking kind of funny but Jun and I do
[1:29] surveys online and E rewards does a
[1:32] survey well most of the time the survey
[1:34] begins with what's your birthday or
[1:37] what's your age and they have a
[1:39] bracketed age it's not exactly they want
[1:41] you know from 44 to 49 and then from 50
[1:45] to
[1:47] 54 well next year I'll be in that 55 to
[1:51] 60
[1:52] bracket that they have out there and I'm
[1:55] like man no I don't want to do that
[1:58] anyway but it's the Lord ter I want to
[2:00] have another
[2:01] birthday you know I I want gey to
[2:03] continue to be older than me for a
[2:05] little while anyway but second Peter
[2:07] verse one let's read the scripture and
[2:11] get started according as he hath
[2:13] according as his divine power ha given
[2:15] unto us all things that
[2:16] pertain unto life and godliness so
[2:19] that's what we were talking about and
[2:20] last week we spoke a good bit on life
[2:23] and
[2:26] Temperance listen it's just a journey
[2:28] and it's it's it's something that Peter
[2:31] didn't get like overnight he worked on
[2:35] it uh the very one that says being born
[2:38] again Peter did there Being Born Again
[2:41] by The Incorruptible word of
[2:43] God the problem with a lot of people
[2:45] because you see that scripture
[2:47] says Being Born Again by The
[2:49] Incorruptible word of God see a lot of
[2:52] people are listening to corruptable word
[2:55] and you can't get perfected by
[2:56] corruptible word it has to be The
[2:58] Incorruptible word of God so you've got
[3:00] to figure out where the corruptible word
[3:03] is and where The Incorruptible word is
[3:05] and thereby I don't think you can go up
[3:07] the statute of a perfect man with
[3:09] corruptible word cuz it's the statue of
[3:11] a perfect man it's making it's you know
[3:15] the five-fold ministry is for the
[3:16] perfecting of the Saints is to make you
[3:18] perfect or complete so you have to make
[3:22] that choice where that is through the
[3:24] knowledge of him that ha called us to
[3:26] glory and
[3:27] virtue whereby are given unto us
[3:30] exceeding great and precious promises
[3:32] that by these you might be partakers of
[3:33] the divine nature having escaped the
[3:35] corruption that is in the world through
[3:37] lust and besides this giving all
[3:39] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[3:41] virtue knowledge and knowledge
[3:43] Temperance Temperance patience patience
[3:46] godliness we'll stop right there and
[3:48] then you want godl brotherly kindness
[3:50] then we looked at the
[3:53] word the word patience means
[3:58] enduring
[4:01] the last one is the one I want that we
[4:05] really a patient
[4:08] enduring you see those
[4:11] ings that's an ongoing process
[4:14] enduring Paul says running the race
[4:16] enduring to the end
[4:18] sustaining how you going to get
[4:19] sustained sitting at home not coming to
[4:21] church sitting at home not listening to
[4:24] the prophet or listening to you know
[4:26] brother Dale or who or whoever you know
[4:28] to get your sustaining
[4:30] uh you know we we fill our bellies up
[4:32] every day uh what about our spiritual
[4:35] belly that's right you know I mean
[4:37] that's but see that has a lot to do with
[4:39] patience cuz everybody wants this
[4:41] everybody wants this remember I told you
[4:43] that power without character is satanic
[4:45] you may have the
[4:46] power you the new birth is the power of
[4:49] God Bible says the power of God under
[4:51] salvation all right so there's the power
[4:53] of God you have the power of God at the
[4:55] new birth but not saying that you're
[4:57] that brother R wasn't saying that you're
[4:59] satanic if you try to use the gift but
[5:01] that power without character you're
[5:03] going to always use wrong because you're
[5:05] going to lean to your that's right
[5:07] virtue your knowledge human your
[5:10] Temperance
[5:12] which short fuse long fuse it doesn't
[5:14] matter when the bomb goes off it's the
[5:16] same thing that's
[5:18] right it's a mess if it's a short right
[5:21] if it's a short fuse or a long fuse when
[5:23] the bomb goes off it's a mess so it
[5:25] really doesn't matter whether you have a
[5:26] short fuse or a long fuse we were born
[5:28] with a fuse
[5:30] right and we've got to
[5:33] sustain and
[5:36] perseverance perseverance is just keep
[5:38] on keep going and and keep fighting man
[5:42] this is a battle you know that you're
[5:45] not just going to get up at statute of a
[5:46] perfect man just by who you are that's
[5:50] right okay or your Birthright except for
[5:53] one that's the new birth right all right
[5:56] but not by your own doings right have
[5:59] long patience bear long suffer long be
[6:03] longsuffering patiently
[6:06] endure to be of a long Spirit not to
[6:09] lose
[6:10] heart that's what happens remember the
[6:12] car remember the the seed that was
[6:15] sewn remember the seed was sewn the
[6:17] plant came up but the Bible says it
[6:20] withered and and and blew away because
[6:22] it didn't take root remember the winds
[6:25] come by and blew it away right what they
[6:29] do
[6:30] they let the world and the things of the
[6:32] world get a hold of them be of long
[6:34] Spirit not to lose heart to persevere
[6:37] patiently and bravely in enduring
[6:39] misfortunes and troubles and I'm sure we
[6:42] all can attain to
[6:45] that to be patient in bearing the
[6:47] offenses and injuries of others right
[6:50] cuz we're going to read in a minute
[6:51] first thing brother Brown said to be
[6:52] patient with was God then patient with
[6:57] there's no way that you you need to be
[7:01] patient of
[7:03] yourself you know what you are but you
[7:06] have to be patient with others right you
[7:08] know you can make yourself mad you
[7:10] understand what I'm saying but that's
[7:11] okay to me I don't mind you know if you
[7:13] say you big dummy but when you call
[7:14] Brother Bob a big dummy that's the
[7:17] difference you understand what I mean I
[7:18] mean you call yourself hey why' you do
[7:20] that you know dummy or whatever you
[7:22] that's yourself but be patient with a
[7:26] brother when he makes the same mistake
[7:27] you made do you say hey big dummy to him
[7:29] you know or her or whatever you put the
[7:32] word in there you want to be patient in
[7:34] bearing the offenses and injuries of
[7:36] others it's wonderful to have patience
[7:38] with somebody when they're the same as
[7:40] you are that's right but when they're
[7:42] contrary to you that's where the
[7:45] patience comes
[7:46] in cuz remember Jesus told us the
[7:49] greatest commandment was to love our
[7:50] neighbor as ourselves and then love our
[7:53] brother as
[7:54] ourselves you know that's hard to do
[7:58] it
[8:00] I mean we all love
[8:02] oursel but can you love somebody that's
[8:04] contrary to you as much as you do
[8:06] yourself had an experience yesterday and
[8:08] I I'll tell you about it next Sunday we
[8:10] won't talk about it today but um uh it's
[8:12] just something that that come to my
[8:14] heart that uh an experience just for me
[8:18] nobody else nobody else knew about it
[8:20] just for
[8:21] me but you got to realize these things
[8:23] and you got to see that that what you
[8:25] got to do is is you got to Bear brother
[8:27] what did Brother R say now brother Brown
[8:29] what if he prayer line would have come
[8:31] up and he would have said oh there's
[8:33] nothing wrong with you just a little bit
[8:34] of this and that going he took every
[8:36] case and he was
[8:37] patient he analyzed every case you're
[8:41] from certain certain Town you're from
[8:43] here he saw the whole thing going on he
[8:45] could have just said you got cancer no
[8:47] he was he was getting an atmosphere he
[8:49] was he was being patient what brother
[8:51] Brown say that woman did that uh they
[8:53] had the baby she prayed for the baby he
[8:57] said that mother entered in
[9:01] she entered into the spirit of that
[9:03] other mother to pray for the baby that's
[9:06] why you sisters when we have somebody
[9:08] come up for prayer and and they stay
[9:10] long in the in the sanctuary you need to
[9:13] go up there and pray with them cuz you
[9:15] know I can't pray for an infirmary you
[9:17] have as a female that I don't have and
[9:20] that don't mean just female trouble that
[9:22] means y'all are just wired different
[9:24] than us Lord Jacob and I were talking
[9:27] about the other day about about um he's
[9:29] been married a year now and um he's
[9:32] figuring out the wiring ain't the same
[9:35] and
[9:36] uh you be put it out for long he says
[9:39] they're just different I said I told you
[9:42] that before you got married they're just
[9:45] and you are but you know what you can
[9:46] enter into that I've never been a mother
[9:48] so if my B if a baby's sick you can
[9:51] enter into that okay but that's being
[9:54] patient bearing the offense in other
[9:55] words bearing the burden of others all
[9:57] right be patient and and injuries of
[9:59] others to be mild and slow to punish and
[10:02] you shall be hated of all men here we go
[10:04] with some scriptures you should be hated
[10:06] of all men for my name's sake but there
[10:08] shall not a hair of your head perish in
[10:11] your patience possess ye your soul all
[10:14] right you shall be hated of all men for
[10:16] my name's
[10:17] sake you'd think that was probably
[10:20] Temperance but that's patience is having
[10:24] patience on who
[10:27] God to do what he said he do remember
[10:30] you come to this analogy and the analogy
[10:32] is that
[10:34] that you may be called up before
[10:36] government we may be called up before
[10:38] government I mean the Bible says we
[10:40] might but said if you're called up
[10:42] before government in other words don't
[10:43] sit down the day before and study what
[10:45] you're going to say right cuz you're
[10:47] going to get it wrong you're going to do
[10:48] your own thing you understand what I'm
[10:50] saying but in patience you sit there and
[10:52] wait on God he said I'll tell you what
[10:54] to say I'll tell you what to say well
[10:56] see when he tells you what to say then
[10:59] what we do we have patience we wait on
[11:02] the Lord they that wait upon the Lord
[11:04] shall renew their
[11:05] strength then now Romans 5 therefore
[11:08] being justified by faith we have peace
[11:09] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[11:11] by whom also we have access by faith
[11:13] into his grace wherein we stand and
[11:15] rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and
[11:18] not only so but we glory in Tribulation
[11:21] H Paul should know that shouldn't he
[11:24] Yeah that poor old guy was beat and
[11:26] stoned and they about own him to death
[11:29] one time and they beat him with u you
[11:32] know 39 lashes or whatever it was that
[11:36] before right before he killed him and
[11:38] nobody liked that guy but you know what
[11:41] he didn't he didn't
[11:43] spend half the Bible lashing out at his
[11:47] critics right he didn't right I mean he
[11:51] would make little Snippets and say Hey
[11:53] you know you this or this or this this
[11:55] but he didn't spend a whole lot of time
[11:56] well bless God you know even David we
[12:00] were reading there you look David said
[12:01] my en my enemies have compassed me my
[12:03] enemies have done but I Look to You Lord
[12:06] I Look to You Lord and he didn't even
[12:07] have a new birth he just had patience in
[12:09] with God because of his because of his U
[12:13] countenance his his demeanor and
[12:16] patience wait and not only but we glory
[12:18] in Tribulation know that tribulation
[12:20] worketh patience so you're going to have
[12:23] to go through let me warn you if you
[12:25] hadn't already you're going to go
[12:27] through tribulation to find out if you
[12:29] got patience right all right so you're
[12:32] going to it's going to happen and
[12:34] patience
[12:36] experience and experience hope so
[12:39] there's a there's a a broad range of of
[12:42] what's going on here with patience cuz
[12:45] to me
[12:47] patience is a key because look how close
[12:49] you're getting up in the pyramid you
[12:52] know you're up number four there in
[12:55] patience and man you're right there at
[12:57] godliness
[13:00] and then brotherly kindness so you're
[13:02] packing it
[13:03] in but I think
[13:06] patience to me just to me personally
[13:09] Temperance and Patience are the two
[13:10] things that are key because they're
[13:12] right there in the
[13:14] middle you know it's kind of like the U
[13:17] kind of like going to you know you got
[13:19] first quarter second quarter halftime
[13:22] and then in halftime you prepare
[13:24] everything for the next two quarters you
[13:26] know so we're preparing if you got
[13:28] Temperance in patience that's preparing
[13:29] you to propel you on up to Godliness and
[13:32] brotherly
[13:33] kindness because you know you run well
[13:36] you virtue knowledge is good make virtue
[13:40] knowledge but you got to have Temperance
[13:42] what I'm saying knowledge knowledge is
[13:44] kind of you can get that on your what
[13:47] you understand what I'm saying you can
[13:48] get that on in other words you can
[13:49] experience stuff for yourself you can
[13:50] read the word of God yourself but now
[13:53] Temperance is around you that's right
[13:56] what's around you that's right you got
[13:58] it not is you and God that's right you
[14:00] understand what I'm saying yes virtue is
[14:03] you and God but it goes out to other
[14:04] people that's right but now Temperance
[14:06] is coming back at you right patience is
[14:09] coming back at you that's right but see
[14:11] godliness and brotherly kindness then
[14:12] though is what goes out from you so you
[14:14] see what I'm saying God starts you real
[14:17] slow and he says okay I'm going to work
[14:18] on you and I'm going to give you
[14:20] virtue going to come out now knowledge
[14:23] is going to come out cuz it's what I
[14:24] give you but now Temperance and patience
[14:26] is what's going to bombard you this way
[14:28] right it's what's going to come in here
[14:30] and beat you to death that's right then
[14:32] see godliness is what you portray out
[14:35] brotherly kindness is what you portray
[14:37] out love is what you portray out so to
[14:39] me Temperance and patience is kind of a
[14:40] key in there that you're going to be
[14:43] tested and
[14:46] tried okay go ahead it's kind of like
[14:49] the Soul and Spirit is hardly separable
[14:52] correct that is correct one one of the
[14:54] other it's really Temperance and
[14:56] patience to me are the ones that are so
[14:57] close together you can call them both
[14:59] because even it says right there that in
[15:02] patience possess you your soul you know
[15:04] and all these things in patience
[15:06] Temperance and patience like I said they
[15:08] they go really hand in hand because it's
[15:10] what happens to you externally if you
[15:13] ever thought about that look at the
[15:15] statute of perfect man faith is an
[15:16] internal work virtue is an internal work
[15:19] that shows out right you got to have
[15:22] virtue before it can go out knowledge
[15:24] you got to have knowledge before it can
[15:25] go out but now
[15:27] temperance is somebody what they're
[15:30] doing to you patience is what somebody's
[15:32] doing to you now godliness is what you
[15:34] got going out cuz you're showing to be
[15:37] like God right and then brotherly
[15:39] kindness It's what you show that's right
[15:42] it's not what they're doing it's what
[15:43] you're doing Temperance and patience to
[15:46] me though is the key we we really you
[15:48] know we spend a good bit of time on
[15:49] Temperance but we can flip-flop back and
[15:52] forth with Temperance and
[15:54] patience and not just be P listen being
[15:57] patient is not just something somebody
[15:58] like Sister
[16:00] Barbara that's just human she's just got
[16:02] human patience you understand what I
[16:04] mean she's got Godly patience I believe
[16:06] but inside of her is just a patience
[16:10] that for her to work with the children
[16:11] she works with and for her to be around
[16:14] a bunch of us loud mouth and be able to
[16:16] control herself and be able to you know
[16:18] and you understand what I mean you
[16:20] understand I mean and and look at all
[16:22] the situations in her life and you know
[16:24] she's just not it's
[16:27] justness just just a calm you know and
[16:30] there and I enjoy that I really do I
[16:34] wish I was that way a lot of times
[16:36] but and y'all do too I'm
[16:40] sure we can all say Amen
[16:43] together amen okay brother brand said
[16:47] though that you can have all of the sure
[16:50] just have them not not even have Godly y
[16:53] have be that time first what you need is
[16:56] Godly wisdom to operate the knowledge
[16:59] why if you look if you look at the pope
[17:02] he would seem
[17:04] Godly read scriptures every day you
[17:07] understand what I mean he he he he
[17:09] doesn't drink smoke cuss never had a
[17:15] wife all these things you'd think well
[17:17] he's he's the closest to Jesus but yet
[17:20] he's the absolute
[17:26] Antichrist so here we
[17:31] go you got to show it a little bit
[17:33] better than than what the pope said but
[17:35] like I've always said these are these
[17:37] are virtues that that reflect back from
[17:39] the word of
[17:41] God you know it's got to be it's got to
[17:44] come from the word it's got to be a
[17:45] revelation it's got to be a um a change
[17:50] yes it's got to be a change and you
[17:53] can't go to any motivational seminar you
[17:55] can't get it preached into you you can
[17:57] get it preached and then you receive it
[17:59] but brother Bram said you know preach
[18:01] patience till they get patience you just
[18:03] keep preaching it and the people
[18:05] somewhere they click and everybody's not
[18:07] going to get it at the same time we've
[18:09] been through the statute of a perfect
[18:11] man here at this church three or four
[18:12] times
[18:13] and every time we go over it maybe it'll
[18:16] Jack us up up to a higher level and make
[18:18] us a little bit more aware cuz all I can
[18:20] do is make you aware that you got a
[18:23] problem yes and I got a problem I'm just
[18:26] making you aware of that you know the
[18:27] Lord's going to to say hey this is where
[18:29] you need to work on it
[18:31] at and it's going to come from
[18:33] experience right all this is going to be
[18:35] experiened cuz remember we read the
[18:36] scripture says life and godliness so
[18:38] it's life and what you do in your
[18:40] Christian Life we desire that every one
[18:42] of you do show the same
[18:45] diligence and what's that perseverance
[18:47] diligence and perseverance is the same
[18:49] thing cuz look at us we've been here now
[18:52] 50
[18:53] years almost since brother Brown's been
[18:56] gone 25th thing will be 50 years the
[19:01] prophet will be gone 50 years and we're
[19:03] still here got people that can't even
[19:05] understand things out there that you
[19:07] know you preach to them and they look at
[19:08] you like with a blank look on their face
[19:11] and it's something that there in this
[19:13] church we amen and know what the
[19:15] preacher is talking about you understand
[19:16] what I'm saying yes so you but you got
[19:19] to have patience yes God did yes he had
[19:22] patience with you so he's got to so we
[19:23] got to have patience with others that's
[19:25] right you know everybody can't get to
[19:27] the same level and everybody can't do
[19:28] the same thing you do
[19:31] amen we're all
[19:33] different and we desire that every one
[19:36] of you do show the same diligence so we
[19:38] got to show it right to the full
[19:40] Assurance of hopeing to the end let's
[19:42] keep on going that you be not slothful
[19:45] but followers of them who through faith
[19:47] and patience inherit the
[19:50] promises and boy was Abraham one of
[19:55] them now Abraham
[20:01] waited 25
[20:04] years and he got worse it wasn't like
[20:06] God came to him at at 15 years
[20:10] old and said you're going to have a
[20:12] child and then here he is you know 30 or
[20:14] 45 or whatever I'm still have kute no he
[20:17] come to him at
[20:19] 75 and he was finally he was able to
[20:21] have one like Dad has been talking about
[20:23] you know with Hagar but not the promised
[20:25] child and then he had to wait on a
[20:26] little bit further he had to wait on so
[20:28] it was totally
[20:29] impossible for Abraham to have any
[20:32] thought in his mind that he can
[20:33] naturally produce this baby that's the
[20:35] same thing God wants with these virtues
[20:37] when you can't humanly produce them
[20:41] right when you can't humanly produce
[20:43] them that's when God says okay I'll give
[20:45] them to you now right when you can't
[20:48] humanly because remember when you
[20:49] humanly produce it it's like what Mom
[20:51] said when you humanly produce it it's
[20:53] just it's just you living a good
[20:56] virtuous life yes a lot of people live
[20:58] good virtuous
[20:59] life there's a lot of people's going to
[21:01] come up to the Lord remember in the
[21:03] scripture and says have I not done this
[21:05] and this and this and this and this and
[21:06] this cast out devils and spoke in
[21:08] tongues and preach the gospel and all
[21:10] these things he said depart from you I
[21:11] never knew you in other words you were
[21:13] built on your own ability and not mine
[21:15] all right for when God made promise to
[21:18] Abraham because he could swear by no
[21:20] greater he swear by
[21:23] himself saying surely blessing I Will
[21:25] Bless thee and multiplying I will
[21:27] multiply thee and so
[21:30] after after he had patiently
[21:35] endured now God may come down and give
[21:37] you a promise just like
[21:40] that but most of the time you know if
[21:43] you're going to have patience you got to
[21:45] wait for something that's right right he
[21:48] obtained the promise Hebrews 12:1 let's
[21:51] get we got the scriptures last week
[21:53] let's get through them and get to a
[21:54] couple of quotes wherefore seeing we
[21:55] also are compassed about with so great a
[21:58] cloud of
[22:00] witness excuse me let us lay aside every
[22:05] weight

[23:37] of patience behold we count them happy
[23:40] which endure you have heard of the
[23:42] patience of Job and have seen the end of
[23:45] the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful
[23:47] and tender of tender Mercy now let's
[23:50] read here statute of perfect
[23:53] man paragraph
[23:55] 228 when your knowledge is like his
[23:57] knowledge I come to do thy will on God
[23:59] say with the father's word he defeated
[24:01] every devil Heaven and Earth will pass
[24:03] away but the word will not
[24:05] see when you got that kind of knowledge
[24:07] it'll vulcanize with your faith when you
[24:11] got the right kind of temperance like he
[24:12] had it'll vulcanize if you haven't just
[24:15] a man-made halfway sou up belief or
[24:17] Temperance oh I slap him down but maybe
[24:20] I better not cuz they might put my name
[24:21] in the paper about
[24:24] it how many of us are guilty of that
[24:28] H silence in the room I didn't hear
[24:32] somebody said no no was me I a never
[24:34] thought about doing that wellow you're L
[24:37] that ain't that ain't the kind of
[24:39] temperance he's talking about don't try
[24:42] to add that it won't work but when you
[24:44] can really with a sweetness from your
[24:46] heart forgive every
[24:48] man hold your
[24:50] peace shut
[24:53] up Let it Be Gone see then it'll
[24:57] vulcanize
[24:58] see let it be gone in other words Let It
[25:01] Go all
[25:04] right didn't Paul tell us one time that
[25:06] we wrestle to our own destruction
[25:08] somebody somebody in in the New
[25:10] Testament said we wrestle we wrestle
[25:12] with things we can't do one thing about
[25:14] that's right
[25:17] nothing I can't save my kids but I can
[25:19] try to have enough virtue that one day
[25:21] they'll catch a hold of it that's all
[25:23] you can do you can add that to your
[25:26] faith
[25:29] one day I'm going to have to help Daddy
[25:30] on that cuz when he says W ew he goes we
[25:33] that's not we
[25:35] that's our brother R go you hear on tap
[25:39] he
[25:40] go
[25:43] no listen the no wonder the church is so
[25:47] short isn't that right no wonder I'd say
[25:50] repent and be baptized Bible says the
[25:52] name of Jesus Christ and strict TR
[25:53] trinitarian don't believe that said that
[25:55] Antichrist he did Jesus name he's Jesus
[25:58] only Look Out Boy I don't know about
[26:01] your Temperance right now see he's
[26:02] linking Temperance and patience almost
[26:03] right here together of course they are
[26:05] together but watch him right
[26:07] here was brother R let's reason this
[26:10] together I'd like to hear this explain
[26:12] see then come down and listen to it then
[26:16] it's put right before you and then you
[26:17] walk away well get to that just in a few
[26:20] minutes in godliness but when you fly
[26:24] loose want to jump at every conclusion
[26:26] now that's not having patience right
[26:28] that's right that's not having
[26:28] Temperance our patience that's right all
[26:30] right that's not it see you haven't got
[26:33] Bible Temperance yet when you do that
[26:34] how to answer back then if you got all
[26:37] this you can add this to your faith now
[26:40] he gets into it then fourthly we'll read
[26:42] a couple quotes and then we'll go
[26:44] upstairs a little bit full today so
[26:46] we'll get up there and not stir around
[26:48] so much then after that fourthly you
[26:51] want to add patience to your faith if
[26:53] you've got faith it work as patience the
[26:56] Bible says so this is patience
[26:58] now that's the next thing is going to
[26:59] build this stature you know God has got
[27:01] real material in his building see how
[27:04] short we are brother sisters see see why
[27:07] where we're at yes sir we have Glory
[27:10] we've had that for 50 years we have
[27:12] shouts and things we've had that 50
[27:15] years because we got faith we've got
[27:17] power this is the power right and then
[27:21] with the message man that's the power of
[27:24] God all right what are we doing with it
[27:28] though are we just having faith cuz
[27:31] right here he says we have Glory we have
[27:33] shouts and things because we got faith
[27:36] so we got to New Birth he said we got
[27:37] faith faith is New Birth right but when
[27:39] we come down to these things
[27:42] here God can't build us into that
[27:45] stature see he
[27:46] can't he can't
[27:49] well yeah God can no God can't do what
[27:52] you won't let him do that's right that's
[27:55] right he won't override I mean even
[27:57] though you got faith and got the new
[27:58] birth he's timid he's not going to
[28:00] override your freem moral agency he's
[28:02] not going to he's not going to say I'm
[28:04] just going to give you patience no
[28:07] that's contrary to the Bible that's
[28:09] right all
[28:10] right that's why I believe that and and
[28:12] Buster will probably see this but the
[28:14] brother cross here in this church over
[28:16] here that's what he said when he told me
[28:18] he been he's been watching these and he
[28:19] said I thought you got them when you was
[28:21] born again he said it that's not he said
[28:25] that's contrary to the Bible in other
[28:26] words he said I see you have to add
[28:28] these afterwards well he's he's trying
[28:30] to get them and that's good that's good
[28:33] get them into a you know get them into a
[28:36] shape where they can receive something
[28:37] you know um we understand that could be
[28:42] in a different group you know different
[28:44] group who virgin or whatever but when we
[28:47] come down to these things God can't
[28:48] build us into that stature see he can't
[28:51] he can't make us up to that kind of
[28:53] place we got all these other things we
[28:55] fall slide off it see he can't build his
[28:58] church why can't he build his church he
[29:00] said he was going
[29:02] to cuz somebody's going to right
[29:05] somebody's going to take it and go with
[29:06] it all right now brother R says patience
[29:10] with what this is paragraph 233 statute
[29:12] of perfect man what kind of patience
[29:14] first thing is have patience with
[29:20] God if you got real genuine faith you'll
[29:24] have real genuine patience because Faith
[29:26] work patience When God says anything you
[29:30] believe it that's all you got patience
[29:33] that's right but now then we go and
[29:35] start trying to figure stuff out all
[29:37] right say well I asked him last night to
[29:40] heal me and I'm just as sick tomorrow oh
[29:42] my what
[29:46] patience I run past my
[29:51] quote God told Abraham and 25 years
[29:54] later there wasn't even one sign he was
[29:56] still believe beling he was patient with
[29:59] God
[30:00] uh-huh put him always before you let him
[30:04] be the next Crossing thing you can't
[30:07] cross him so just keep him before you he
[30:12] said so it's going to happen so keep him
[30:14] before you that's
[30:17] right Noah had
[30:19] patience Noah had real Godly patience
[30:23] God said I'm going to destroy the world
[30:24] with rain and Noah preached 125 years
[30:28] plenty of patience not even DW fell from
[30:30] heaven was it nothing see it's not that
[30:33] it's rain the there was no such thing as
[30:37] rain and we must we must use this
[30:39] analogy the same way
[30:42] with there's never been a body change
[30:45] like you listen to what I'm saying like
[30:46] we're taking today so when we talk about
[30:49] a body change it's just like Noah
[30:51] telling the people it's going to rain if
[30:52] you tell somebody you're going to take a
[30:53] body change they
[30:56] go right
[30:58] what we going have a body change you
[31:00] know nominal people and even people in
[31:02] the message yeah we're going to have a
[31:03] body change but how do you get there you
[31:06] got to know how to get there plenty of
[31:08] patience not even DW fell from heaven
[31:10] wasn't nothing just as Dusty It Ever Was
[31:13] for
[31:15] 120
[31:18] years but he was
[31:20] patient then God tries your patience
[31:22] after he told that's right God tries
[31:24] them now what happened what happened
[31:26] with old Noah
[31:29] it we stop right here what happened with
[31:31] Noah he preached 120
[31:35] years finally he got all the animals in
[31:37] the ark God told him to go in the ark
[31:40] God shut the door did it start raining
[31:42] right
[31:46] then seven days they sat in that
[31:51] Ark got worse and worse symptoms got
[31:55] worse you probably could hear hear him
[31:57] out there say oh no what's wrong is they
[31:59] going to
[32:00] rain you hear rocks probably throwing
[32:02] rocks you know a bunch of unbelievers he
[32:04] told no I said no I want you to go ahead
[32:06] and get in the ark I'm going to run the
[32:08] animals in there and I want you to get
[32:09] in climb up way upstairs now so you can
[32:11] look out top window I want you to get in
[32:14] there I want you to tell these people
[32:15] tomorrow what I've been preaching for
[32:17] 120 years is going to take place all
[32:19] right you go down there and tell
[32:24] them we'll stop right there but you
[32:26] remember what happened
[32:27] M remember his daughter comes up says
[32:30] Noah what daughter-in-law said Noah what
[32:33] it's going to rain 7 days he had to wait
[32:36] inside that Ark but you know what no one
[32:38] knew that if God shut that door see you
[32:40] that's what you got to look at little
[32:42] experiences Noah couldn't physically
[32:44] shut that door itself that's right so if
[32:46] God shut the door it was going to happen
[32:48] that's right it's going to happen so
[32:51] it's going to happen that's right the
[32:53] body change is going to happen we just
[32:54] got to be able to get there so we'll
[32:56] start start right here next Sunday Lord
[32:58] bless you get
[32:59] up be quiet and easy going
[33:13] upstairs
