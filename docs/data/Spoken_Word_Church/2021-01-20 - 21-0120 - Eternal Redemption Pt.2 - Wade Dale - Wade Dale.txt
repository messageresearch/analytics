the lord we've now stepped into a new chapter of our american tradition now we have a woman vice president so yes what i say thing yeah you got your bible turn to the book of hebrews we're going to continue our thoughts from sunday on the eternal redemption i hope you enjoyed that we i i did whether you did or not i i enjoyed it sometimes brother luis will tell you you know sometimes you really enjoy what you preach and sometimes you really just don't i mean but but somebody will come up to you and say boy that was the best sermon you ever preached and you're like man i was like a flat tire yeah right yeah so i guess it's not up to us is it bro good to have you all back glad you hadn't made a good trip but i'm glad you made that trip back this way hey man good to have you back and uh in service for the lord but hebrews 9 11 we're still on the plan this will be part two remember it's brother tara it's talking about february the sixth you need to be there about four o'clock get your picture took and um make sure you sign up downstairs also before we do that um i'll make two more announcements and then brother joe if you don't mind pulling that up that we were talking about but february the 14th which will be valentine's day i'll be in kentucky june and i will be at brother richard hyatt's we just talked to him on the phone he said tell everybody hello and god bless you but we'll be there on the weekend of valentine's day so and then also june the 17th 18th and 19th will be the father's day fishing trip did y'all notice what color she had on today y'all sit down please tell everybody sit down go brother dale said everybody have a seat you notice that that's purple brother brown said now i predict i saw a great woman stand up beautiful looking dressed in real highly royals like purple why did she wear purple she may not be the one but it's like uh brother joe and i were talking if this is not it it's opened the door for it but there she stands in the prophecy she was standing up the only one without a mask on free to be able to speak i guess you don't have the virus she can't get the virus i guess but there she stands in purple but the reason it's not on here but the reason that that they all were there were several other women wore purple was because of the suffrage movement of the women in the 1900s because they couldn't vote and all the things that brother brown said remember that we uh the things we did wrong by allowing women to vote and all that sorry women that i didn't say that the prophet did just live by it amen because we're all women in the body of christ okay but there you are there she is in purple whether she used to do anything with it or not i don't know do you you don't know maybe brother brown saw that in the vision maybe you saw that very picture of a woman standing up with her hand up and her other hand on the bible and mr well now president biden just today hired a transgender woman to be our health director a transgender woman to be our health director in the united states of america and she you right she's ugly as all get out he is he was a he you see how perverted this thing is we're just about ready to get out of here it's just all pointing i mean we're gonna have to let but you know what's gonna happen we're gonna listen to this transgender woman tell us that it's okay for men to go in women's bathroom and women go in men's bathroom and there's not going to be any gender to our bathrooms anymore we were talking today and you want to stand back up we were talking today at the post office and one of the girls she's kind of a little country girl and she said if some country boy walks in and there's a girl in the bathroom well i don't know what's going to happen especially if it's a transgender woman but this is what the nation's coming to she's going to lead our medical ideals as a transgender person she was a man now she's a woman so if this if god if god don't destroy this country he'll have to raise up sodom and gomorrah and apologize for it so that's what we're coming to though we got everything we need now you say well now what no you know what i believe this happened because something has already started happening in the bride the true bride is going to be and already is on her way out of here amen we listen signs follow the believer that's a sign but it should be something that we don't follow that that follows those two spirits that we now know where listen that's sure that is part of the other spirit but that ain't the spirit i was talking about during the whole time i'm talking about the one that's right here uh that just shows you that though you know half of the world is is rejoicing over it and the other half don't mind and the other half don't care somebody will get that one these days okay but that's what we're coming to men women children just be aware watch what's going on it's going to get worse but we have a hope of eternal redemption we had a prophet come tell us 50 something years ago no no longer than that 70 something this was 1930 something when she he saw that vision my come on now that's been a long time and and then we see it prophecy being fulfilled as brother dale's talking about we see it right here with our own eyes and you know what we didn't see it as a prophecy we saw it as a reality exactly amen a lot of people saw it as a as as looking at a prophecy but when you're stan when when noah prophesied for 120 years that it was going to rain one day when god shut that door of that ark it rained the fulfillment of that prophecy noah was looking out the window at it so that's what you and i are doing now we're looking now out the window of the mind of god looking through the mind of god the prophet's already been there he was the first one to partake go back into the back part of god's mind but you and i are able to do the same thing and then just instead of say oh me we can say praise the lord right and you know what i didn't need that to tell me the prophet was right though no he's a word prophet the word tells me you read here in revelation 17. you got the woman what she said and she's sitting on what she's a red and purple and scarlet colors decked with gold chapter 17 revel book of revelation so let's see how this ends up but let's talk about the plan of redemption because you know what it's a perfect plan will not fail they talked about plans all day today how bad how everybody was going to do this and not just naming everybody but everybody's going to they got all their plans they will fail that plan will never fail man's changed god's never changed man's wrote different things has changed god's wrote one thing and it never will change so let's put our existence on this right here on the word of god hebrews 9 verse 11 let's pray before we before we get started just remember these announcements remember guys june 17th 18th 19th get your time off for you for the father's day fishing trip there in helen we've already got the lodge it is rented already so hebrews 9 verse 11. dear heavenly father thank you lord because many prophets stood and wanted to see this day the fulfillment of all scripture from genesis all the way to revelations and now here we stand and lord we may not know tomorrow but we know who holds tomorrow and that same person's inside of us and i pray lord that you would give us as i pray every day we should always pray for supernatural guidance not just guidance by man not just guidance by parents not just god it's by this or the other but supernatural guidance lord just say the right thing and do the right thing and lord if it's you it will be done right so lord take all of us out of the way tonight you enter in you take over you do the speaking you do the revealing and let us have a good time in you father we pray that you'll just be with the ones that are sick be the ones that are not with us lord ones that we see the virus may be not so much around uh here anymore in different places people getting over it and getting back to church father we pray that you'd protect us now lord put that protection over us father that holy ghost veil that'll keep not only our our soul what was redeemed for eternity but lord help get that outside man ready to go father we ask these things lord in the name of jesus christ amen hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building now we're going to get into some types and shadows later on as we go into this plan looking at the ten commandments and what happened there the writing on the uh up there mount sinai and all these different things we're gonna break it down last time we just kind of flew through the timeline but we're gonna kind of break it down a little bit for the young ones and for the old ones that's maybe forgot like me neither by the blood of bulls and calves but by his own blood he entered once into the holy place and here's where i got my thought having obtained eternal redemption amen for us amen god bless you and have your seats eternal redemption for us he had to obtain he did not have to obtain eternal redemption in his soul he was the he was the fullness of the godhead body so so he was father son and holy ghost almighty god but his body had to be redeemed his body had to be made eternal all right just like you and i our body has to be made eternal but remember he didn't come by carnal knowledge like me and you that's that's why he could do the things he did i and my father are one i only do that which the father saith you know i in other words like i said before he didn't get up in the morning fighting over the guy inside of him and we do really you don't well pray for me amen but having obtained eternal redemption for us now we we covered i'm going to go through well we got about half of the note so i'm going to cover this real quick if you'll go to number one but while they're pulling number one up if you'll remember we were talking about man and god has made everlasting covenants he made one with a bow or a rainbow he made one with adam if you'll do this i'll do this he made one with different ones down through time but he finally comes to abraham which is the father of our faith and he didn't say abraham now if you'll do this and not give your wife away and if you'll wait till you're 99 years old he never put a condition on that he said i will that's the same way with genesis 3 15 he didn't give that to nobody else but himself one of the greatest scriptures in the bible where god says i'll redeem this thing back i had to let it fall because i put you in flesh i'm a redeemer a savior a healer and all these different attributes that are bottled up inside of me because i'm what i'm infinite god and these things have to come out amen and then what happened and we'll look at it in just a minute we're talking about this book we may cover that a little bit later on down here we're going to read where in continuance in other words there was a book written right there was a book of life and there was the lounge book of life we know that there's different sections of that book one you can be taken out of one you can't be taken out of right amen if you're born again see remember that genesis 1 26 man was written in blood in the lounge book of life and never could be taken out but had to wait till the time for you to get here so that it could land where it's supposed to land because the real true seed is the spoken word but he had to allow your natural seed to get here by mom and daddy and grandma and grandpa grandma and grandpa grandma and grandpa right to get you here to match that part that he saw before the foundation of the world amen now what happened to a lot of us is brother donnie he saw us brother ryan said he took a picture of it at 19 years old we've done flew past that most of us and next tuesday one more year past it for me so joyce won't be an old i'll be an old man she'll be an old woman now she's just way older than i am you were born in the 50s you can't understand that i was born a whole different decade than you were yeah was born in the 19th century jim says 18th for you but god said i will and when god said i will he already had it in here brother brown said what is god's will his will is his word so when he said i will he's writing it down this is his will this is his whole will this is what he wills us to do but he doesn't will us to do it because remember the bible says he would that all be saved see god's not a god yeah he gets angry and he has different emotions because the bible says he has different emotions he even repented that he made man knowing what he would do but being god he had emotion where do you think we get ours ours is just perverted his was not jesus jesus that's why jesus didn't have a problem with the father whatever the father said do that's what he did he never had a carnal mind to look back on and said well i can't do that because my mom or daddy is shy talks too loud you understand what i mean he didn't have that to look back to you know what he looked back to he said before abraham was right i am and then they said thou art the christ in other words they put him all the way back to where we're talking about now back into eternity they just couldn't understand how that man that they saw that would have to eat and maybe got sick and grown with a headache and and was so tired he slipped through a storm could be almighty god but he was see that's the same thing with me and you we look at all of our human inadequacies and we say well we can't be god well now if they said jesus wasn't god they're going to say you're not right just like i said before you know if we've got god in us and the same attributes they're going to treat you the same way they did when he was walking on the face of the earth amen but brother brown said job the oldest book of the bible was supposed to even be written before moses wrote genesis but the oldest book in the bible was speaking of redemption yet redemption was far way before that redemption is one of the oldest things in the bible did you know redemption was even before the plan of redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed it can't lose listen adam couldn't lose he lost one part he had to give that book back the part the eternal part yes that's right hello he had to give that back to god couldn't produce that anymore but remember there was a book of life that was opened and began because when seth was born and when when even when um cain and abel and laban and all these different ones down to time there was a book written and they came by carnal knowledge they came by sex but when god stood there in genesis 3 like brother dale said god didn't curse adam god didn't curse eve he cursed the ground so where did he have to come from he came from the ground took sperm took egg placed it in mary put it in the earth and here comes jesus christ the baby that looked 50 years old but yet he was only 30. what a rough ministry he must have redemption is one of the oldest things in the bible did you know redemption was even the plan of redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed think of that now here we were last sunday god foreseeing boom knowing what we would do knowing what we would do even if we didn't do it that's infinite right that was hard for me to understand brother dale one time we were going somewhere and it was about a two hour trip or maybe going hunting or somewhere and he started laying that out and my mind was going whoa i never thought of it that way but an infinite god knows every way you would have chose if you had not a chose like i said if you had five choices five choices brother harris helped me one time because he he told me he said you know he said god showed me a vision that this person that was i think it was in this church was supposed to marry this other girl but he didn't he married another believer and it was fine it was okay he said but he should have made her because i saw it in the vision i'm like well how in the world but then brother dale comes up and says god knows you if you didn't marry june if you made you find a mad joyce lord oh never mind um but not really he would but think about all those girlfriends that you had that like dad he had a girlfriend there to at home and before his mom and just a dating well that could have been my mama but it couldn't have because it took the two to get together that had me in it that's how god used to now now see i believe in predestination that way you're predetermined to get here but it's because of what god foresaw before the foundation of the world that that genesis 1 26 man was developed in the mind of god and this is what donnie fall bush is going to look like and this is what luis youregos will look like and their tendencies and characteristics and god liked it so much he sent a prophet here to say and god bred this one to this one this one to this one this one to this one to get you here so that that would match wow see when we lay a plan out we have to change it but when god lays a plan out he's already saw the end of it so it cannot it cannot fail now i'll go with you if you go to that i always was eternal and i'm this eternal being amen but that's in the mind of god he holds that only and it took a profit to bring it to us though but now in that interpretation i don't know why i'm doing this but it there but with that interpretation people in the message they pervert it and say oh you always was eternal you you always come here you had eternal life already in your soul when you were born a baby because god saw you brother brown tells you we were if you weren't there you never will be there it's not you right the real you the one you've never seen before that god stood back whatever he was standing on and said let us make man in our own image there was an image that god projected in his mind and it wasn't of adolf hitler or your neighbor or anybody without the new birth they came because of permissive will they came just to fill this earth up to be your tormentor or whatever you say but only god only in his lamb's book of life he's only got a certain group of people written down and that group of people is the only one that's going to fulfill that genesis 1 26 it'll be the bride of jesus christ that's why i said before if you can't read we couldn't read revelations i told you the other day i'm going to go talk to a baptist guy i don't even know him but he's got one of the biggest churches there in guiltful goes with baptists and he seems like to be a real nice guy and i'm just going to sit down and say look man tell me about predestination by the baptist not by your view because you went to seminary i know he did i said tell me what predestination is by the baptist doctrine i don't i'm not going to fight with you i'm just going to write it down i'm doing research amen and i want to find out exactly because you know we say that they say this and we know that there's been certain times they've said this but i want to really know because i want to know where they got off at we know it was nicea but that came from catholic church but it evolved into a baptist doctrine it evolved into a presbyterian doctrine it evolved into a methodist doctrine it evolved into a pentecostal doctrine and then the pentecostals we got to church of god and no music speaking in tongues no speaking in tongues one god jesus only you see what i mean it got perverted somewhere as it went forward but when god said let us make man in our own image folks that person he made not created but brought into being yeah was perfect never had a bad thought never drank a beer never lusted you see what comes to you at your new birth but you got to let that thing live you got to let that thing out amen let it out and let it work because you still got that spirit realm of memory reasoning conscious affection and the devil just stays right there and plays all day amen but listen god knew that he gave you something he gave you a shield a helmet a sword you got it already when you get the new birth property i said you got all everything you need for your journey glory but what our problem is though is we don't listen to it a lot god foreseeing and making a way of redemption before he even made the world right for the bible plainly says that christ was predestinated for ordained and was the lamb of god slain before the foundation of the world that's right way before the world was made god had a plan of redemption everybody say amen buddy that's a good one first corinthians 2 verse 6. now watch how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory listen god knows who he is he loves to be worshipped but he loves fellowship glory he doesn't want to beat you and make you worship him no that's not a true ruler the glory he gets is us the glory he gets is seeing that genesis 1 26 man come into shape and fruition and grow up into a what adoption grows up into god wants us to speak folks him speak through us everybody got there didn't brother bryan say one time god's not complete without you amen you know what he wanted it that way i'm just dumb enough to believe it that's the way he wanted it he wanted us and all of our inadequacies and all the different things he wanted me and you to share his glory and man he wanted that and that was his whole desire and part of the plan knowing we would fall knowing we would come and lay out a sea and see a woman stand up and get sworn in as vice president he saw this but he put us here for a purpose titus 1 verse 1 in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began but hath in due times manifested his word what through preaching now we can get a lot listen you can get a lot at home you can get a lot press and play but you can't get perfected by that right um bible says he gave some apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists not to make you born again but to perfect you through preaching which paul didn't have a problem telling them where it came from which is committed unto me according to the commandment of god our savior in other words he stood up one day and he said you'll be judged by what i say that's right if an angel from heaven come and preach you anything that you that you've not heard me preach let him be a curse an angel that scripture keeps going through my mind brother luis come boldly to the throne of grace not stupidly not stupidly but boldly but now remember let me tell you what would what what would look stupid what would look stupid to the world to a bystander to some news agency is when here's goliath all about 14 i mean he's this guy is two times taller than david and here's the news agency pointing at him and over here at the camp of israel and here's saul and they're like well maybe saul he's a you know he was head and shoulders he freaking signed had all the armor he had fought many battles and then all of a sudden out of all that walks this little guy by that thaw with nothing but a belt a piece of leather on and a little bag and a sling in his hand and all that armor glittering in the background all this armor glittering in the background and there's this big giant he's got this great big sword i mean great big staff to the world david looks stupid but to god that was exactly what he wanted david to do david didn't look at the news agency david didn't look over there and wonder and david i don't believe david even looked behind him to see if anybody was following him because he knew what he was going to do he said today i'll take your head off right he said you have defied my god when are we going to stand up and say the same thing look stupid of the world that's fine with me but when we're going to stand up and somebody say something about you sister say something about your clothing hair a man say look we're bible believers right we believe what the bible says i'm not worried about what you're saying what you think of me or what the world thinks about us are you ashamed jesus said if you're ashamed of me he said i'll be ashamed of you he said if you'll stand up for me he said i'll stand up for you ephesians 1 verse 1. to me like i said this is the whole plan of redemption paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are ephesus so that's me in you and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from our god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ look according as he has chosen uh where in him many are called few are chosen according us he has chosen us not by him now there's been a lot of people chosen by god to do certain things pharaoh was chosen by god to do certain things hitler was chosen by god to do certain things all these different place people were chosen by god to do different things right but now they weren't chosen in christ and act the way they do if you're chosen in him then whatever he's got and remember he had the whole plan father-son the whole plan of redemption is actually in those three offices father son holy spirit whole plan of redemption is in those three things right there amen according to chosen us in him when before the foundational world oh boy like brother dale said they just go oh boy i feel i was back listen you were nothing forget that business but you know what somebody must have read that though dad somebody must have read that though and said well we were back there as people because see the mormons get the same they got a doctrine that we were all back there so we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world so we must have been back there no prophet god said you were nothing right the only thing jesus christ the difference in you and me is we can't remember back there he stood one day and said i and my father one father let us have the same fellowship as we did before why because he was eternal right he was the eternal god and he said before abraham was i am you know he was the one that talked to abraham unless you got three or four gods he stood in the bush talked to abraham picked him up some dust fed him uh communion as melchizedek and then met him a few years later as melchizedek and abraham did have no problem saying my lord that's right who in the world can stand there and say abraham i'll visit you right you're gonna have that baby and sarah's gonna be the one to have it it had to be almighty god what fulfilling his plan that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace when he hath made us accepted in the beloved amen all right so we're accepted in christ right this is really elementary but this is how it all got started christ got accepted by dying on the cross in the mind of god before the foundation of the world now where were we where were we we were in him not as people but as that genesis 1 26 that germ of life eternal life because remember he started plasm he started passing that out to adam right and he became an eternal person eternal soul oh my but when the fall happened god couldn't do that anymore right he forfeited god had to take the take the book back we'll get into it this time but it did not stop the plan of god nothing will stop the plan of god you can't stop it go out there and go out there and have a prayer meeting all night that the sun won't come up tomorrow ain't it happening because god said it's going to come up amen in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence look having made known unto us the mystery of the of his will us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times in other words this right now this 2000 last 2000 years he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and look in whom also we have obtained an inheritance remember i told you last sunday jesus didn't come to bring you your inheritance your inheritance was before the foundation of the world he just came and made a way for you to get back to it amen that doesn't do away with jesus christ he's the very key to this thing don't ever forget that if he hadn't went to calvary you and i wouldn't have been released right also we have obtained an inheritance being what predestinated there's not a problem with that but brother rama always said he said be careful with that word you know why because that word is predestined predetermined destiny now if you do that and take it the way a lot of people take it on this one side you don't have a choice you get on this other side over here and it's just it's just greasy grace no you got a choice if cain had a choice you had a choice because he was to me the worst of the worst being that he killed his own brother but bringing being predestinated what according to the purpose i'm not going to add to this but listen according to the purpose of him that saw all things from the beginning to the end that saw all things because look who worketh all things after the council of his own will he in his mind he saw these things happen and he said this is the way i want it i've said before we question we have questions i want everybody to hold a hand up already right now raise your hand up you have questioned god that's the only way he could bring it we questioned that he came to rahab we questioned that he came to the woman at the well we question these things and don't think that it works good in the plan but it's not it's the very plan of god and it's the only way that it'll work see that's why that's why john said if you add a word or jesus said to john on the isle of patmos he said if anybody adds a word to what you're writing down let him be a curse if anybody don't do what says in this book i'm taking the name out of the bible out of the book of life how serious is that right all right revelations 13 8 all that dwell on the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world we'll get into this a long time from now but remember when the bible tells us that the books were open you and i are not in that book that's the book of life right we're standing in our book's already been open it's open down here you are the book the bible says what living epistles known and read of all men right we've already been judged by the judge himself and we were written right here but every other person that dwells on this earth will be deceived except those people right there amen number two christ mystery guard reveal excuse me he has showed or revealed it and every type that's in the bible now i said something the other day and it kind of you don't have to have a lot of discernment when you see people's faces especially now that i can just see your eyes instead everybody going you know your eyes tell what's going on so your eyes are the gateway to your soul right so anyway but when i said that uh that the bride doesn't type anything the bride doesn't if you type christ you're a second person i thought we were christ made manifest in another form called the bride i thought all that in the bible was pointing to this day i thought all that was typing and hinged on a bride being on the earth not a second person what is a type a type is abraham typing christ right here abraham typing christ this is not christ this is abraham that's right but when you and i get born again this is the christ there's no separation so believe me when i tell you this whole bible is hinged on having a bride of jesus christ that's not a second person listen satan can type christ boy that made some of his eyeballs go back in your head didn't know what the bible says and brother didn't brother ram say he could make what he could bring every supernatural thing that god could bring except creation there's those two spirits folks that can make it so close listen he's going to deceive everybody in the world thinking they're going to think that god almighty has come down in a pope incarnated the pope and he's going to save this whole world right or are they going to be fooled we're going to be gone though but everybody in the bible somewhere down the line is typing me and you didn't they top christ they type christ now remember christ was back there but these people typed them because that christ was not in these people in the old testament everybody understand that i want us to understand that there's no way when adam did what he did it closed up the natural womb and the spiritual womb of eve so she could not produce the genesis 1 26 man which was the soul of god into the soul of man that's what happened with abraham with sorry adam right right especially into adam he placed eternal life in his soul man and he became an eternal person eve too but nobody after that right that's right because god i say god was gonna take this uh eternal life adam eternal life eve and guess who was gonna come out not dead people that's right they couldn't produce dead people but satan knew if he could get eve to do what he did what she did and produce naturally there's no way god could touch that it was polluted god said i can't touch that no more there'll be an enmity a division between me and you i i can't come into your heart anymore but i'll come back what a plan i'll come i'll put in my ten i'll be the one that comes down and you may bruise my heel and put me on a cross but i'll cut your stinking head off when he went to calvary he stripped satan of every power he thought he ever had telling you folks we can think all mysteries and god you know even paul said we can know all mysteries and not have charity this is chair this is love i'm preaching to you love the love of god that that god almighty in the in before the beginning of time saw all this got it all set up and listen but listen it's not like we're going through the motions like this though oh no no no every day you get up you've got a choice to do something or not do something so when i say you're not and that doesn't belittle you to say that you're not that you're not a type if you're a tight look again here's abraham here's christ let's take a different one here's moses all right here's moses when he was they had to veil his face because christ would come down and anoint moses right but now what do you have to do he had to come off of him right and go back into the holy of holies right right and bulls and goats covered moses his sin and the high priest covered their sin didn't do away with them all right because god couldn't get into their soul because he took that book back and remember brother brown said he was the owner of the book now revelations 5 what happens christ the lamb takes the book from the owner opens it and reveals it brother brown says the most sublime scripture in the bible why because john knew that if somebody didn't come on the scene he was he was as dead as the rest of them but when he saw that lamb there it is the full plan of redemption opened up so adam i mean abraham could type christ moses could be so close till they had to veil his face because of the because of the anointing and the glory on him but when it would go off of him um who was it willie if someone was preaching or maybe brother bob he was moses again well now listen folks when you get born again your old u's dead better be that's our problem we let him live but if that old you is dead christ comes in and then you're not a type right that's right got it moses is the type of christ but he can never be christ manifested in another form called the bride only me and you by the revelation of the opening of the word we see that calvary wiped it all away but the blood of bulls and ghosts couldn't come back and go into moses couldn't go into you'd think moses now buddy he's a great guy he stood in he stood in the gap right he stood as christ but see there's your type we're not as christ i was thinking about that this morning or yesterday morning we're not as anybody satan is as christ right you and i are christ i didn't say that god did saint john 17 jesus said lord i pray that they're one like me and you're one well how are they one he has showed a reveal to every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is revelation of god's mystery where in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible now look all the acts of acts of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing what god's great goal is because remember moses was a peace you can't do away with moses you can't do away with isaiah you can't do away with ezekiel you can't do away with elijah you can't do away with john the baptist but they were types they were not the bride of jesus christ but when we come down right here and expressing what god's great goal is and now look and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and god's help you'll see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it to me that's just like the apostle paul standing up and saying if you don't believe what i said that's the same thing right there he's fixing to tell you that morning in christ the mystery of god revealed he's fixing to tell you what god's plan is and what part you are to play in it that's just one quote and there's many many more so we went to the greek lex economy we saw that christ was to anoint and watch how we we talked about furnished him with the necessary powers for its administration and doing christians with the gifts of the holy spirit we showed last sunday this is where we stopped adam remember adam abraham moses joshua david elijah all different ones had pieces of it now remember though the bible tells us that this man right here was the son of god why because he had eternal life in his soul abraham's not called abraham's called a friend of god moses was a great prophet joshua typed christ david typed christ but not to the degree that he typed him like me and you like i mean come on he get he had his best friend killed on purpose just so he could get his wife that don't type christ why because the anointing was off of him and he was david the unregenerated man that okay i'm not belittling any of them but you know what when we meet them they're going to say i knew i messed up but i couldn't do anything about it i had nothing inside of me to stop right elijah all the different ones in other words they had their flaws and they had their things but you know what they type can you not see brother dale's preaching that adam adam is showing us we have a human body we have eternal life in our soul we can't get it we can't get the new birth as a baby so we have to be a little bit older right abraham father he just believed he believed without the new birth man you're supposed to believe because we got the believer inside of us okay moses same way you look at all these different ones they're pieces to the puzzle but they're not this body that he needs to complete itself right and not belittling them at all none zero but that's the way god's plan was he said i'm gonna come back and do it myself but when i come back and do it i'm not just gonna go away i'm gonna come back because i'm not finished brother brown said jesus's part was not finished at calvary sure he said it's finished what the party needed to play right but he wasn't finished wow no he just got started what on earth it got started on earth christ came back to earth and endued christians with gifts of the holy spirit not that they would just now sure there's anointings this anointing is the least singing there's anointings to play the piano there's no learning to play the banjo guitar that's anointing listen and i'm not don't get me wrong that's an anointing that anybody can have gifts and callings are without repentance god can you listen how do you think these people i was looking delivering mail you see a lot of mail pieces but this guy i don't know what his name is but he's got this ministry that's just out of this world and he looks kind of about the same way he looks kind of an oriental guy but he's got pamphlets even in a little town called guildford he's a young guy and his hair's all swooped up like this and done up like this and they're following him like mad what does he say he got a message ain't nobody got a message but you and i sure they got a message to the world but not to get out of here amen not to finish the body that god started they got messed up in other words what happened their wound got polluted like eve's wound got polluted so god can't come through that anymore boy listen if this don't make you happy that god chose you amen in this hour this day he chose you to be here right not just be in this church but be in this great message of the hour [Applause] all right let's go read number three we read it at the end of the service now watch now god's secret mystery he had before the world begun now back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and going to achieve and he had watch he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed that's his motivator that's why listen if we're not perverted listen to me if we're not perverted a woman a girl plays with a doll because she's got that motherly instinct in her and that's a trait that she needs to express because she's supposed to be a mother the boys are playing with the tonka toys and they're building stuff with hammers and they're beating the walls up and all these different things why because that's the attributes if you don't like i said if you don't get them crossed like you got them in the end time but that same way with god he had these attributes to be expressed but he couldn't express them fully in the old testament he couldn't express him fully in part of the church ages because he can't work in folks doctrine god cannot and will not work in false doctrine he can allow it but he can't work in it like he wants to work in it right that's why god had to send us a prophet that's why god had to fully had to bring this man that could look back in the back part of god's mind that's a place most people don't get to go but according to brother branham he went back there and gave you the key to get back there yourself oh no bro wait he took it with him he knew so much listen uh no he brought us he didn't bring us the book book was already here right he brought us the ability to look in all pages of the book how in the world would you talk to a denominational person about abraham and sarah being turned back to young men and women but brother brown explains it so well until you have to look like hater wright said ain't nothing but true right married old grant somebody's wanting a king that could have any woman he wanted to and here they are a 300 mile journey down to guerrero and she's supposed to be like 90 something years old and and the kings just said bring her into my into my court right she was changed back to a young woman but god said hey uh-uh see how god protects things because sarah was going to have isaac through abraham not through that stinking king but he told that king he said if you touch her you're a dead man he said oh you know what you're done he well he said that man's my prophet that lied to you you need to go ask him to pray for you and open up the womb of the people in your kingdom or your dead kingdom and i'm sure a bimbling was like i can do anything he's when it lied to me but yet god had an order abraham was this man of the hour because first there wasn't even a moon star at a molecule or anything he was god but he exactly wasn't god at that time because god is an object of worship there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and him was love and him was to be father and him wants to be son and he wants to be a savior and him was to be a healer and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in god see we see him expressed so my opinion the first thing he made was angels and then they worshiped him and that made him god he started from there and in previous messages i've tried to explain it and break it down now then when angels began to worship him that was before there was even a molecule on earth remember back when we were talking about the two spirits he created lucifer first then he created the angels and then satan produced a product and half of them took it or two-thirds of them took it and the other ones didn't we'll talk to about it just a minute all right and that's the influence that's down here on the earth now but remember satan didn't give his influence to eve through another person he came himself he's the real pro he's the original perverter and he was going to do this all by himself he wasn't going to trust it to no second person guy angel no he come himself just like christ wasn't going to let anybody else come down here and die he was going to do it himself right i tried to explain it break it down and now then when angels began to worship him that was before even a molecule on the earth there was nothing it was all darkness there wasn't no sun moon stars nothing then he was god as he asked job where was you when i laid the foundation of the world see when the morning started saying together and the sons of god shouted for joy see now where were you see that was way back before the earth now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on the church to own to the church this morning this afternoon thank you the hidden mystery of god that it had in his mind before the world ever began so look there was a hidden mystery there was a prophet of god standing on earth saying i'm fixing to tell you what that mystery is wow i don't see how the you know i was thinking today all these people that are denying that brother branham was whatever what what he was saying he was wrong of this and that and the other but you know what i bet you some of them people don't turn around and that are still preaching whatever they preach i don't but i bet you they're not how can they go back and preach the father son holy ghost baptism when the truth's been told them right there in the bible i'm talking about all these truths i ain't talking about going i ain't talking about fishing on the wrong day i ain't talking about a cloud being over yondering over here i'm talking about doctrine that was straightened out by this prophet in the end time regardless of what he turned out to be i don't care what they think he was he was the prophet of god glory and he was a word prophet he brought us a hidden mystery that god had in his mind before the world ever begun and how that's unfolded itself right down to this present hour how positive is that that we're living in right now then you will understand clearly then you see on i believe what is being done so now we remember god created angels and then satan took his part and watch we're going to have to see though before we start with the chart we're before we're before the creation we're still before creation and got to create man on the earth pretty slow huh all right let's go to the next one revelations 12 verse 7 says and there was war in heaven now we covered this before during the two spirits it's kind of all overlapping here for me but it's all for us to go back and you know dig up these things out of our memory and they're real right listen if god's thoughts are real if you have the thoughts of god they must be real too just like water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ that's the thought of god that's not the thought of nicea rome that's not the thought of the theologians that's the thought of god and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prophet prevailed not neither was there a place found anymore in heaven where brother brown said he said sin started in heaven but then it continued down here on earth and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him now let's go to jude 1 verse 5. watch this and i will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not now what's he talking about he saved two million of them unbelieving rascal what what uh moses called rebels he saved them gave them ten miracles wiped almost egypt off the face of the map to get them out knowing they everyone was going to turn him down and die but he did it anyway that's what jude's saying he knew what they were going to do yet he took them out right and afterwards he destroyed them that believed not and the angels which kept not their first estate what was the angel's first estate worship god that was their first estate worship god pretty easy pretty simple i'm god i created you but they kept not their first estate but left their own habitation heaven dimension that dimension not we point up but remember it's just another dimension we'll get into that later on too he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness and to the judgment of the great day so those angels are going to be judged but where did they go they came down here into the garden of eden but like i said before there might have been a lot of devils in the garden of eden but there was the devil head guy himself he said i'm going to deal with this i want to be god you all might not want to be god i want to be god let's go to genesis 1 1. in the beginning god created now we're almost into our chart we'll start in our chart next time we preach oh this coming sunday brother chris long will be with us both services so be praying for him they'll be flying in on friday and flying back out on well they're going to somewhere else tuesday or wednesday going to brother jewell 40s so i'll just pray for him but i'm sure he's going to bring us a truckload of preaching so in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth the earth without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep the spirit of the lord moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light we understand eyes that we explained all that brother louise myself different ones and there was light that's not the sun and the moon that's the light exactly that's the revelation that's where god is god is light and in him has no darkness at all all right so now let's go to genesis 1 25. god made the beast of the earth after his kind the cattle after their kind i got to kind of cover this because this is where we see the physical earth being formed something stand on and animals and plants and trees and mountains different things right because you got to cover this because listen that's going to enter into this dimension when we get into this chart the first three dimensions are what life light and matter right life light and matter everybody got that not eternal life life because remember once we got into the first three dimensions of life like matter there was something happen that took eternal life out of that everybody got that adam was the only one that had it god gave it to him but when he come down through here and did what he did god had to turn that light off oh sure the sun kept coming up the moon kept coming up but that light that we're talking about that light that lights the whole world it went out because god had to fold the book back up brother brown even illustrates that adam had to hand the book back to the one that owned it because he couldn't bring light anymore in other words he had to die yeah physically not spiritually he physically died but we're not supposed to spiritually die or physically die amen so he said look let us make man in our image and after our lightness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and fowl the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image to me that's a great revelation folks he just didn't create mankind mankind came after came after that man came in life light and matter because look what is matter my hand won't go through that that's solid matter but now remember before the fall the prophet of god said said that adam ruled the world like the holy spirit rules should rule us so when jesus christ come back into the upper room with the disciples this wouldn't matter anymore this was just something even just like i believe adam could brother brown said adam could say tree move right well what would happen that tree would move that's what happened when that fall came man it just darkened the whole world but it didn't stop the plan of god it made every attribute start coming just like this savior immediately healer savior redeemer all the ones all that it started immediately and he was listen even though god knew that's what was going to happen he knew it had to happen i'm going to read that quote in just a minute that luis said i already had it part of it part of it down not the other part that he read but look so god blessed him and god said to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth now brother brown said this was before they were put in human flesh so you're to multiply without having human flesh involved now did you get the new birth by your human flesh no it came through your human flesh but you got the new birth by the spiritual part of god your mom and daddy brought you here by flesh right [Music] permissive but you had to get here to get us to have a soul to get a soul here to get you here so that god could sorry kill the old nature right yeah amen and god blessed him instead of then be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and follow the air and ever live in creation now look that's what god wanted that's what god saw in his mind part of his plan but he knew when 2 7 came and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground bring it up and breathed into his nostrils a breath of life man became a living soul and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed so he knew when he put him in human flesh go to the next one genesis 2 7. there you go breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living saul and lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and he put the man who had formed and then we know what happened after that there was a separation eve was made right and then we know what happened and so let's read this quote that brother louise read and then will it's pretty long but you know what it's worth it because luis you and i you and i couldn't have said it like this none of us could have said it like the prophet said it so that's why i'm going to read it like this now that we have come this far let me try to crystallize your thinking i like what he says let's crystallize your thinking on this subject so you can see the necessity of our going into the serpent seed doctrine as i have we start the fact that there were two trees and we've already been through this and how they've intertwined the tree of life was jesus the other tree is definitely satan because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree now then we know that both of these trees had a relationship to man so it's not just trees with bark on it right it was christ and the devil got it one anointed and the other one anointed they must have had a part in the sovereign plan and purpose of god in their relationship to mankind and to himself or we could never impute omniscience in other words all-knowing unto god this is all true so far is it not now the word most definitely sets forth that from before the foundation of the earth the purpose of god was to look share his eternal life with man now where did that say that where does it say that verbatim it don't i just read it to you though god said let us make man in our own image and after our likeness that's exactly what he was saying i'm gonna make an eternal man i'm gonna make somebody i can live with for an eternity and they're gonna be my children they're gonna be part of me they're gonna have part of my character share his eternal life with man ephesians one and we read this i'll read it again according he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace when he has accepted made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the reaches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which has performed in his purpose in itself and in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven which are on earth now that's us and everything else even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will now read revelations 13 8 this prophet's reading this this is part of the quote and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him satan whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world now this is the quote but that life could not and would not be shared in any other way than through the way of god manifesting in flesh everybody got that amen you may hate your flesh but this is the way you're going to be god wanted you in human flesh god is going to you're going to get a body change and you're going to live eternal in human flesh we're not spooks we're not angels we're not floating blobs we're humans we're going to walk on this earth we're going to talk on this earth we're going to have fun this was a part of his eternal and predestinated purpose right so in other words he didn't bring genesis 2 7 into being for this thing to fall apart no no no no but he knew it would if he put him in flesh right all right this was a part of his eternal and predestinated purpose this plan was to be to the praise of the glory of his grace it was the plan of redemption it was the plan of salvation now listen closely god being a savior it was necessary that he predestinated a man who would require salvation now watch look at me genesis 1 26 that's not that man that genesis 126 man never fell never fell adam fell which had part of that ending but he failed right but look predestined a man who would require salvation he put them in flesh and then when adam and eve did what they did that stopped sons and daughters of god from being born like god wanted them to be born because her wound was polluted up here and down there everybody got that and god's not gonna come listen god's not gonna dwell on an unclean vessel he's not gonna use an unclean vessel amen that would require salvation in order what to give him reason and purpose of being right that is 100 correct and multitudes of scriptures beared out as does the very pointed verse of romans 11 36 for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen god could not directly come and partake of that tree of life in the midst of the garden that eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first oh man that's when he said i'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman well who's the seed of the woman christ in human flesh is the seed of the woman but before god could raise and save a sinner he had to have a sinner to raise and save man had to fall the fall which would be caused by satan had to have flesh to make fall like i said before that genesis 1 26 man that was a spirit man that man never fell that's god almighty in portions in parts that's not a type right that's him the fall which would be caused by satan had to have flesh to make fall satan had to come through flesh also but in other words satan couldn't create a human flesh and go into it he just watched god create and he said there's my point of entry right there that beast can talk here he can talk to the animals and he can coincide with that animal and he can coincide with humans but now remember god didn't say well now i'm going to create that beast and then satan's going to no creative evolution read your bible plants then birds i mean fish then birds then beast of the field and there was the beast and then there was man creative evolution all the way up all right but satan could not come through human flesh to make the fall as would christ come in human flesh to restore the fallen but there was an animal the serpent so close to man that satan could get to that beast and through that beast he could get to human flesh and cause to fall he knew he could listen he knew he couldn't touch everybody that's got the new birth in their soul there's something that satan can't touch so if adam had eternal life in his soul eve had eternal life in her soul he couldn't touch that right he couldn't change that but he could he could take the spirit because the flesh just reacted to what was going on right so satan right here but there was an animal and through that beast he could get to human flesh and cause the fault look and inject himself thereby into the human race even as jesus would one day come and inject himself into the human race into human bodies even to the extent of a resurrection where we would have bodies like his glorified one let's talk about me and you that's what god worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan and when satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of god then man could not get to the tree of life in the garden why it went back to the original law it went god had to step out of that dimension he had to let the first three dimensions life light and matter right no more eternal life in the dimension have i got that that's why you've got your dimensions and thank god it took a profit to tell us exactly where those dimensions were you know what i believe happened you know what the first three dimensions are the slowest dimension so i just believe god slowed everything down he just stepped back up into into another dimension he just stepped over into another dimension he didn't leave he was still in the garden right i just where'd he go he's almighty god he knows what's going to happen the next day and the next day the next day so he knows where to be which means i'm omniscient i'm the i'm the president i'm the president right i'm the president who knows where to be when he needs to be there all right but man couldn't get back adam had done what he did eve had done what she did in flesh they couldn't get back to that spiritual tree to that light they couldn't get back to it and even though adam typed christ and took eve and sheltered her and didn't have sex with her to save her good lord and mercy but he did shelter her and he said i'll take on god i don't i don't create another one she's me now that type christ we know that and i'm sure christ said oh man but remember adam thought he could get yourself get him back in the garden he's not the savior he had every act of it see you have the attribute of god inside of you today right but you're not the savior to save the world amen because he's the he's the fullness of the godhead bodily which is all those titles you and i don't have all those titles we're part of those titles but we don't have to we don't have to get on a cross and die and my spirit can't go into brother donny but if we're born again we've got the same holy ghost in our soul by the new birth he puts us right back to where we should have been had there not been a fall and when satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of god then man could not get to the tree of life in the garden certainly not it wasn't time but an animal animal had caused a fall had it not let animal life be shed and was taken his blood shed and god had communion with man again remember what was the first thing god did kill the lamb throw the skins in and said put them on sacrifice right the animal would be a substitute in this dimension right these first three dimensions the animal is a substitute but i'm god and i'm going to step over another dimension because i'm what jehovah it was jehovah with his family but jehovah didn't go on vacation he was sitting right there leading them right through knowing what they'd do but you know what he knew what you'd do and saved you anyway too so don't feel so but look but god had communion with man again then there was to come a day when god would appear in flesh and by means of what by means of his humiliation he would restore fallen man and make him a partaker of that life eternal see adam couldn't impart eternal life to anybody else he wasn't the savior he wasn't the fullness of the godhead bodily but that man the fullness of the godhead bodily he's the one that stood and said right let us make man in our image we forget that sometimes that same man who stood on earth it's the same man his soul was the soul of almighty god once you see this you can understand the serpent seed and know there was no apple eva no it was the degradation of humanity by ingermingle intermingling what natural seed not spiritual seed remember we all come now by natural seed but don't worry the seed of the woman which woman doesn't have a seed so she has to get one the seed of the woman come by jesus christ virgin birth to bring the plan the fruition let's go right here genesis 3 15. we'll be done right here musicians get ready to come i got two things to read we're going to talk about a book and a couple of couple more maybe next service and i will put enmity between then the woman and between thy seed who's you talking to the serpent thy seed and her seed there's your two spirits thy seed is satan her seed can't be a woman it's got to be her given seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel until the woman he said i will greatly multiply by sorrow and in thy conception and in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and adam said because thou hast hearken and he sorry and unto adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of your wife and has eaten of the tree of which i commanded these things remember that was your covenant if you eat it this is what's going to happen if you don't this will happen thou shalt not eat if it curses the ground for your sake in sorrow thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the ground for out of that what's thou taken for dust thou art now that was not supposed to be but because of the fall people had to die so he's going to go right back to the garden and adam called his wife's name eve because she was the mother of all living unto adam also and to his wife did the lord make coats of skins and clothe them in other words as we read the quote many times before let us stand i'm going to read one more so leave that up musicians get ready to come as i said before excuse me we look and we see that adam called his wife eating wife's name eve because she was the mother of all living it didn't say adam was the mother but father of all living because there was a seed injected into eve that was not his amen called the serpent seed that's where the i will put enmity a division but now listen at that time then christ couldn't come me and you couldn't come paul peter james john nobody could come like god wanted the first plan now listen he didn't like i said i can't say this any other way he had a perfect plan but one point the plan he saw remember his infinite plan he saw was that there was no fall right he's infinite but he saw man would fall therefore he made the plan and we're going to look at it on the chart here because look god stayed in eternity he's an eternal person i don't care where he's at even david said you leave my soul in hell right but he stayed up here and what happened the fall brought us down into time and the time is the first three dimensions life light and matter but guess what's going to happen what is redemption whatever's fallen is going to be taken back out right it's going to be restored now listen most people think that that restoration is going to be somewhere out the under it started on the day of pentecost god didn't get into coats of skins of animals he got into the coats and skins of human beings and it did not stop the plan of god he just wrote this right here in the book of psalms i love this psalm 139 verse 15 my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in your mom and daddy in the lowest parts of the earth everybody understand what i'm talking about i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth your mom and dad didn't know who you were didn't even know when we were born it was it was a surprise for a boy and girl or a girl right you had the way the kid was born before you knew what the gender was so it was all left up into the hands of god but when look he said my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect knowing we'd fall knowing we'd go do the things of the world knowing we would do all the knowing we wouldn't even want god brother gary for a long period of time in our life right and then we get jumbled up into everything else knowing yet being unperfect but look and in my book all my members were written right which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them in other words you came i came paul came peter came who would have known you never you never know anything about the apostle paul whether he had brothers or sisters or whatever but his mom and daddy brought paul on this earth curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth he was named saul at the time and he was probably when he was a little kid if he was like he was when he was older he was beating up on the kids hook knows you brother brown said hi tempered all right but god saw his substance before the foundation of the world and he said i like that guy i like that guy i think i'm gonna use him and in the book all my members were written i'll never forget when you read when i read that quote brother brown said god's got an album god's got a family album he's got a book that i oh he looked at before the foundational world and here goes everybody by but we had to get here first which in continuance were fashioned when as yet you weren't even on the earth when he was on the cross i was on his mind god bless you come on musicians let's sing a song in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them right right when yet you were just nothing but a glimmer in your mom and daddy's eye we had to come the way we come because of what happened in the fall it stopped sons and daughters of god from being born but only temporarily when christ come on earth that was at genesis 3 15 being fulfilled i'm here i'm going to see this plan fulfilled and then i'm going to come back into my believers and i'm going to fulfill this plan of redemption let's sing a song god bless you when the redeemed amen i am thinking of the rapture in our blessed home on high when the redeem our gathering in glory and the midnight city in the sky when the redeemed are gathering and think about [Music] what are we gathering we're gathering around the word of god [Music] but let's have a little party now and let's not invite the devil to this one he's gonna show up anyway but let's have a time for me and you our gathering [Music] [Music] oh [Music] but the angels never got that they can't sing that song we'll listen for they cannot join that song when to redeem our gathering again [Music] [Music] oh [Music] are gathering in and we'll hear his invitation come ye blessing of the lord when the redeemed are gathering in you cannot fail [Music] go with god pray
