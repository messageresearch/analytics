[4:26] for thus saith the Lord to the van of
[4:28] Judah and Jerusalem remembered Jerusalem
[4:31] was split druke Judah and Jerusalem they
[4:37] weren't split as far as one one place to
[4:39] one another they had split off earlier
[4:44] for some reason but that's why he's
[4:47] talking about judah and jerusalem
[4:48] because judah was separated a little bit
[4:50] from Jerusalem because you're going to
[4:51] see this later on in the intestate break
[4:56] up your fellow ground and so not among
[4:58] thorns first guard all together playing
[5:10] he- Jerusalem they smile
[5:16] I heard that none can touch it see Judah
[5:23] did live in Jerusalem so they were
[5:26] separated user lived outside but what's
[5:28] going to happen is and in history
[5:31] they're going to come together alright
[5:33] so this is what Jeremiah saying to them
[5:35] declare you in Judah and publishing
[5:37] Jerusalem and say blow you the trumpet
[5:39] of the land cry the other gather and say
[5:41] assemble yourself to let us go into the
[5:43] defense cities standard wartime retired

[5:53] north and a great destruction all right
[6:00] that keeps growing up the main fonts
[6:02] bigger lies come up from its ticket and
[6:04] the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his
[6:06] way he has gone forth from this place to
[6:08] make doll and desolate in that city
[6:10] she'll be late weight without an
[6:13] inhabitant they still might
[6:14] Nebuchadnezzar exactly the man 10 pound
[6:20] anchor
[6:24] and he shall come to pass that day says
[6:27] the Lord at the heart of the King shall
[6:29] perish in the heart of the princes and
[6:31] the priest shall be astonishing the
[6:32] prophet shall wonder that's ready to see
[6:40] these people at that time shall it be
[6:50] said to this people and to Jerusalem
[6:52] when I wind of the night places in the
[6:53] wilderness toward the guard my people
[6:55] not to fan or to clams behold he shall
[7:07] come up this clouds and his chariot show
[7:09] me his whirlwind his fortunes are
[7:11] swifter than Eagles woe unto us where we
[7:13] are spoiled from wickedness for a voice
[7:25] declares from Dan and publishes
[7:27] deflection from Mount Ephraim
[7:34] Jerusalem at the keeper of a field are
[7:44] they against her around about because
[7:46] she had been rebellious against me said
[7:47] Lord stop right there for a second what
[7:49] Jeremiah's doing he's telling you that
[7:52] now what's happening in all these people

[13:56] paragraph 78 not that works is now now
[14:00] we are told from the going forth of
[14:02] commandment now we are told from the
[14:04] going forth of commandment to rebuild
[14:06] the city two aside and Messiah was who
[14:10] Christ of course shall be seven weeks
[14:13] and threescore in two weeks making 69

[14:22] that same am now you getting it down if
[14:26] you want me to run over it again I'll be
[14:28] glad to do it now we are told from the
[14:31] going forth of commandment to rebuild
[14:33] the city to the massage Shelby 77 that's
[14:36] the first right here I believe he's
[14:38] pointing right here because remember
[14:39] that chart you got withdrawn on a
[14:41] blackboard behind him at the tabernacle
[14:43] so he's referring to the chart all right
[14:48] chubby 7 that's the first first right
[14:51] here seven weeks and threescore two
[14:53] weeks make 62 and seven is 6069 week 7 x
[14:58] 69 would make 483 years therefore until
[15:01] them aside now we're coming to this part
[15:04] now until the Messiah there's got to be
[15:07] 483 years I make up thats a man or an 83
[15:11] years that's what's promised according
[15:13] to nail the Jews are restoring by temple
[15:17] worship build the walls build the
[15:18] streets and then Jesus is going to come
[15:21] on the scene and then he's going to be
[15:23] cut off that's what happens in this 483
[15:26] year their makeup that all right now
[15:34] now let's back up just for a second
[15:37] because this is where it gets confusing
[15:39] to most people back up two paragraphs 72
[15:44] same book just look over another page or
[15:47] paragraph 72 thanks night thanks 90 in
[15:53] your in your booklet all right got it
[15:57] gonna take a slow thanks hang out 72 now
[16:02] if there was seven look there's exactly
[16:04] 49 days he corrects that 49 years rather
[16:08] in the time of the building of the
[16:10] temple are seven prophetic prophetic
[16:13] wigs they're the key seven weeks because
[16:16] there was seven weeks determined to the
[16:18] temple to rebuild the temple and it was
[16:19] built in exactly twenty nine years now
[16:24] stop right there we got a problem you
[16:31] want to watch see what the problem is
[16:33] huh alright let's go to John to John
[16:39] chapter 2 now watch what's going to
[16:41] happen John chapter 2 and the Thursday
[16:46] that was American Cana in Galilee the
[16:48] mother of Jesus from them both Jesus was
[16:50] called in and disciples to the marriage
[16:51] when they wanted wine as mother jesus
[16:54] said to him well this again remember
[16:58] this is the this is Kanan all right he
[17:01] tasted the wine and and all that verse
[17:04] 11 keep going now verse 15 he may have
[17:09] scored your small cords and drove them
[17:11] all out of the temple this is the temple
[17:14] that's been restored during this 483
[17:16] years okay and the temple was built in
[17:20] 49 years what says them what is my place
[17:26] we fixin have a problem we'll have to
[17:28] deal with because Jesus tells them that
[17:32] verse 17 is disciples remembered that it
[17:35] was written to the old I'm out that
[17:36] eating me up then answer the jesus said
[17:39] to him what sign shorts down to us Jews
[17:42] always have done something seeing that
[17:44] I'm doing these things Jesus answering
[17:46] said to destroy this temple and I in
[17:48] three days and in three days I will
[17:51] raise it up they say the Jews don't you
[17:54] think they know how long we took the
[17:55] bill that temple then just said the Jews
[17:57] 40 and six years was this temple Bell
[18:03] and will and well 46 years was his
[18:08] temple in building and wilt thou rear it
[18:10] up in three days but we know you're
[18:13] speaking of the his body right but now
[18:15] the Jews are saying it 46 years dance
[18:18] and we sit at 49 no very simple they
[18:24] started that they started building
[18:26] Jerusalem then they stopped then they
[18:32] started again
[18:34] so it took him 46 working years to build
[18:37] jerusalem but it took a 49 actual years
[18:41] let's go to let's go down Ezra in bill
[18:46] oven let's fill in yes all right well
[18:52] let's go to Ezra Ezreal tell you exactly
[18:54] what it is I'm going to use my Bible cuz
[18:55] I've got notes in my mouth Ezra one so
[19:00] if you got your Bible let's go to Ezra
[19:02] this is where a lot of people have
[19:04] problems with what brother Ron I'm
[19:08] saying so if we don't get done we just
[19:11] gonna start all over again now that is
[19:15] run chapter 1 i'll put it up here but
[19:20] because now watch Ezra and Nehemiah if
[19:23] you have a Scofield Bible look in your
[19:26] middle notes it says bc 536 now remember
[19:30] it could be off because most ninety-nine
[19:35] percent of the historians I don't know
[19:36] about us or how he got this but I've
[19:38] been going back there's a there's a
[19:41] website called endtime pilgrim it has
[19:43] nothing to do with a message this kind
[19:45] of the denominational Jewish
[19:48] denominational commentator and he's got
[19:52] it down better than ninety percent
[19:55] ninety-nine percent of the message
[19:57] people did all right Ezra one
[20:06] now in the first year of Cyrus king of
[20:09] Persia that the word of the Lord by the
[20:11] mouth of Jeremiah will not be fulfilled
[20:13] what Jeremiah said 70 weeks you're going
[20:17] to be in captivity right but you're
[20:20] going out after those 70 years nobody
[20:23] understand that that was a literal
[20:25] happening 70 years happen back under of
[20:30] the literal time got it of what Jeremiah
[20:34] was saying but remember scripture has
[20:35] two meanings dual meaning alright same
[20:38] way would I am 70 weeks it's to the Jews
[20:40] but it has implications for us that the
[20:43] mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled
[20:45] award stirred up the spirit of Cyrus
[20:47] king of Persia science of the Gentile
[20:49] he's not jus for he made a proclamation
[20:52] throughout all this kingdom and put it
[20:54] also in writing sayin the stash Cyrus
[20:58] king of Persia the Lord God of heaven
[21:00] have given me all the kingdoms of the
[21:02] earth and he has charged me to build him
[21:04] in a house at Jerusalem all right we're
[21:07] getting close here we'll get started but
[21:12] he's not gonna finish it who is there
[21:16] among you of all his people he's got to
[21:18] be with him and let him go up because
[21:20] remember Cyrus is over enemies and
[21:22] purging he's over in Persia okay
[21:25] Jerusalem so far off but the Lord
[21:29] stirred him up because Jeremiah's
[21:31] prophecy stirred him up and this is the
[21:33] edit that most people go to our the
[21:36] commandment what who's there ammonia of
[21:39] his people here's God be with him and
[21:41] let him go up to Jerusalem that Gentile
[21:43] knew he couldn't build that temple
[21:44] Gentiles can't build Jewish temple the
[21:48] Jews will not allow that to happen
[21:50] alright which is in judo and build the
[21:53] house of the work out of Israel he is
[21:55] the God which is in Jerusalem and
[21:58] whosoever romance in any place where he
[22:01] sojourned let the man men of his place
[22:03] help him with silver room with gold and
[22:06] the goods and the Beast beside the free
[22:08] will offering for the house of God that
[22:10] is in Jerusalem they rose up the chief
[22:13] of the fathers of Judah
[22:15] Benjamin and the priests and to leave I
[22:17] see they're all out of their country you
[22:21] remember extra okay Esther is before
[22:25] this okay textures in 551 bc so she's
[22:31] before left remember the numbers go down
[22:33] as you get closer to Jesus this time so
[22:35] in 551 bc Esther and the king of Persia
[22:38] gets married and they allow the Jews to
[22:41] defend herself but they don't go rebuild
[22:43] the city they just scatter everywhere
[22:45] never I got there that's the hit they're
[22:47] scattered so this is cyrus now the next
[22:49] king probably in line he comes up and
[22:52] he's telling the people priestly vows
[22:56] with all them whose spirit God hath
[22:57] raised to go up to build the house of
[23:00] the Lord which is in Jerusalem everybody
[23:04] got that and then he's going to give
[23:07] them all this stuff and all this is
[23:10] going to happen so what happens is this
[23:12] is during the time of hoop Ezra right
[23:16] look Ezra this is ezra got it Ezra not
[23:22] near life Ezra alright got it daddy now
[23:28] let's turn to Ezra three
[23:37] we may just get this and stop that way
[23:39] it won't confuse you but you read next
[23:42] week read Ezra and Nehemiah that's too
[23:46] little bitty books but it's very
[23:48] important teresa has run in near my
[23:50] verse 10 and when the builders laid the
[23:53] foundation of the temple of the Lord
[23:55] they set the priests and their peril
[23:57] with trumpets in the Levites the sons of
[23:59] ASAP with symbols to praise the Lord
[24:01] after the ordinance of King I'm David
[24:04] king of Israel all right and they sang
[24:07] together by course in praising you've
[24:08] been dancing to the Lord because he is
[24:10] good for his mercy and do it forever
[24:11] toward Israel Knohl people shouted with
[24:13] a great shout when they praise the Lord
[24:15] because the foundation was laid ok not
[24:19] finishing it but getting ready to get
[24:22] started alright got it the me recently
[24:26] live t fathers who were an ancient man
[24:28] that has seemed the first time when the
[24:30] foundation this house was laid before
[24:31] their eyes wet up with a loud voice and
[24:33] many shouted aloud for joy everybody got
[24:37] that so many of them they're rejoicing
[24:40] now watch chapter 4 now when the
[24:45] adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard
[24:48] that the children of the captivity
[24:49] builded the temple and says Lord God of
[24:51] Israel then they can to Zerubbabel
[24:53] rememberable was the first one to build
[24:55] this to start building on the temple and
[24:57] to the chief of the fathers and Senators
[24:59] they let us fill with you they look
[25:02] their adversaries they're not they're
[25:07] not kinfolk their adversaries let us
[25:12] help you build this temple for we seek
[25:16] your God as you do you're right and we
[25:20] do sacrifice unto him since the day the
[25:22] beasts are having king of a store which
[25:25] brought us up hither but it's a ruble
[25:27] and there's a man named Joshua and the
[25:31] rest of the chief of the followers of
[25:32] innocent of them you have nothing to do
[25:36] with us to build a house unto our God
[25:40] unto our God but we ourselves together
[25:44] will be
[25:44] Lord God of Israel as King Cyrus king of
[25:47] Persia half commanded us now what
[25:49] happened is the devil he's right there
[25:52] then the people of the land Gentile
[25:57] weakened the hands of the people of
[25:59] Judah and judah and troubled them in
[26:01] building so they won't help them to
[26:03] start with yeah it's getting close to
[26:06] the troubles town but that's part of the
[26:08] trouble is time because that's the part
[26:09] of the city that's being built temple
[26:12] okay and hired counselors against them
[26:16] to frustrate the purpose all the days so
[26:19] what happened they just went in there
[26:22] and just started what anything and all
[26:25] these things you know started talking
[26:27] around all right now what happened and
[26:30] let's go to verse 24 let's skip all the
[26:32] other because here are you going to get
[26:36] your 46 years versus 49 verse 24 there's
[26:44] a another decree sent out and this stevo
[26:50] had my insurrection against kings and
[26:51] that rebellion seditions have been made
[26:53] there in other words he's getting
[26:55] frustrated I want to do this for sake of
[26:57] time he's getting frustrated all right
[27:00] now when the coffee let's go 23 now when
[27:03] the copy of King Artaxerxes letter was
[27:08] read before ramen sense i'll describe
[27:10] and their companions they went up in
[27:12] hastings original into the jews and made
[27:14] them to cease by force and power then
[27:18] cease the work of the house of god which
[27:20] is at jerusalem so it's east under the
[27:22] second year of the reign of darius king
[27:25] of persia so they stopped okay so let's
[27:31] make a long story short they stopped but
[27:34] it only took 46 years got it to build
[27:39] the temple let's just say we're going to
[27:41] build a house and me and Jim starts on
[27:43] the house would say we're going to get
[27:44] it done in the year okay all right our
[27:48] we're going to get done in 49 years
[27:50] like that we'd be old for 30 years and
[27:55] stop for a year we build for you know 15
[27:59] more years and stop for a couple of
[28:00] years that's exactly what they were
[28:02] doing what happened was it's the people
[28:04] in the kingdom we just bother them
[28:06] trouble this time instead of them we're
[28:08] going to see that they built the wall
[28:10] with a with a trial in one hand and a
[28:12] sword the other why all these people
[28:14] here Jerusalem all these people started
[28:17] coming here maybe when God is fixing to
[28:21] do something you don't think the devil
[28:22] is right there so all those other
[28:25] princes and people that said they were
[28:26] going to do what they were going to do
[28:28] are now circling Jerusalem just like
[28:32] they're going to do in the end time ok
[28:36] now let's go to chapter 5 likes it read
[28:41] azra now here's another Prophet Haggai
[28:44] and Zechariah we followed the prophets
[28:48] home today prophesied under the Jews
[28:51] that were in Judah and Jerusalem and the
[28:53] name of the God of Israel even unto them
[28:55] then rose up Zerubbabel the sunshield
[28:57] hell and Joshua the sun's over there and
[28:59] began to build a house of dr. hill here
[29:01] they start again and then with him where
[29:04] the prophets of God helping them the
[29:06] problems just didn't set up on the hill
[29:08] they went down help all right now let's
[29:10] go to verse 16 I'm skipping through but
[29:12] it's going to give you something i'll
[29:14] give you a whole commentary in just a
[29:15] minute verse 16 then came to San shot
[29:19] spot just bizarre and laid the
[29:21] foundation of the house is hydrogen
[29:22] through them and since that time and
[29:24] even till now had there been building
[29:26] yeah it is not finished alright so they
[29:31] started building they stop they started
[29:33] building they stopped okay
[29:39] so there was your decree
[29:45] somebody comes back says we need to
[29:47] finish this thing to start building it
[29:49] again so there's your 49 they say 46 now
[29:53] that's final 46 actual years because you
[29:56] remember the Tuesday right down the day
[29:58] they start they write down the day they
[30:00] stop they write down the day they start
[30:03] you write down the next are and then in
[30:05] tradition down through the years they
[30:07] say well that took 46 years to build
[30:08] this temple and it did take 46 actual
[30:11] years but it was within that 49 years so
[30:15] now let me give you a little teaser here
[30:19] for next week now remember Ezra is a
[30:25] profit right brother I'm calling a
[30:30] blushing profit what happened was let's
[30:34] go to just read verse 9 for save time
[30:36] Goodwin don't have time read verse 9
[30:38] what Ezra's telling them said look
[30:40] you've gone after strange women God's
[30:42] trying to bring you together right verse
[30:46] 1 now these things were done the
[30:48] princess came to me saying the people of
[30:50] Israel and the priests and the Levites
[30:52] have not separated themselves from the
[30:55] people and doing according to their own
[30:57] abomination for their taken birth two of
[31:01] their daughters for themselves and their
[31:03] son so that the holy seed have mingled
[31:05] themselves with the people of those
[31:08] lands so Ezra is bringing them back
[31:13] together
[31:17] to quit building watching begin verse 9
[31:20] for we were boiling yet our God have not
[31:22] forsaken us in our london but had
[31:24] extended mercy unto us in the side of
[31:27] the king of Persia to give us a reviving
[31:30] to set up the house of our god no if you
[31:33] got your Scofield Bible this is BC 457
[31:38] that's a long time from when they first
[31:40] started and to repair the desolation
[31:43] thereof and to give us a wall remember
[31:47] you got a wall involved here but look
[31:51] Ezra has nothing to do with the building
[31:54] of the law as you keep Ezra only was
[32:01] given a proclamation to get them to
[32:05] start building that temple but the Bible
[32:09] says in Daniel 9 that it's the Jerusalem
[32:12] the streets and the wall if I got that
[32:17] all right now near my just for about two
[32:20] minutes read the book of Nehemiah if you
[32:22] look at your commentary the Scofield row
[32:25] 14 years after return of Ezra to
[32:28] Jerusalem do you lie to let up a captive
[32:30] species 444 so we're going to get into
[32:33] one more day which is going to make this
[32:35] all pattern out right because 538 BC
[32:39] will not fit anything it's in the damn
[32:43] 70 weeks brother branham told us and I
[32:47] were reading next sunny that somebody
[32:48] did use 538 pc he didn't say it verbatim
[32:52] but if you'll read between the lines and
[32:55] came out the 1919 he said well something
[32:58] did happen in 1919 he said but it's not
[33:02] what they said was going to happen cuz
[33:03] they use this day because remember that
[33:06] anything when they start when they get
[33:09] that wall finish that's the restoration
[33:13] okay and that happened in 445 bc if I
[33:22] got that
[33:23] so that's where we're going to start
[33:24] next Sunday Nehemiah and for 44 BC he
[33:29] comes up he's out somewhere whipped king
[33:33] with a king art disease see our
[33:37] artaxerxes if you read it read it you'll
[33:41] see verse chapter 1 verse no chapter 2
[33:45] first one near my comes and pleads with
[33:48] the King to let him go and help them
[33:51] finish so they're up there just goofing
[33:53] off still they're marrying wise and then
[33:57] doing this and the Levites are not doing
[33:58] what you're supposed to do they're not a
[34:00] city there's buildings there but to
[34:03] remember the people or the city got it
[34:05] all right Sonia my is the one that
[34:08] builds a wall we got to go is the one
[34:10] that builds a wall and that's where
[34:12] we'll start next Sunday read Ezra and
[34:16] Nehemiah if you do that you'll find out
[34:22] all the secrets is coming up
[34:37] you give it a
