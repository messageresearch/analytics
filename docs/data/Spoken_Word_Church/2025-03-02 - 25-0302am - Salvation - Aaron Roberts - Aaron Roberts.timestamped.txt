[0:47] all things to you in the name of Jesus
[0:48] Christ
[0:50] amen
[0:51] amen U this morning I want
[0:54] to look at um top of uh
[1:02] salvation and what it means to be saved
[1:04] and um kind of some of the things that
[1:07] goes with that and
[1:11] U our scripture reading is 2 Samuel
[1:15] 22 uh 1
[1:17] through3 and David is speaking here it
[1:20] says and David spake unto the Lord the
[1:22] words of this song in the day that the
[1:24] Lord had delivered him out of the hand
[1:26] of his of all of his enemies and out of
[1:29] the hand of Saul and he said the Lord is
[1:32] my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer
[1:36] the god of my rock in him will I trust
[1:38] he is my shield and the Horn of my
[1:41] salvation my high tower and my refuge My
[1:44] Savior thou savest me from
[1:48] violence and uh you know
[1:53] um when we look at what it means to what
[1:57] salvation is what it means to be saved
[2:00] and in the in the message court trial
[2:02] brother Brown speaking here he says he
[2:05] said like we claim to be saved he said
[2:08] they say well show me how you're saved
[2:11] my life proves I'm saved the way I act
[2:14] proves whether I'm saved or not no
[2:16] matter how much I testify about it here
[2:19] you'll know how I how I live whether I'm
[2:22] saved or
[2:24] not he talks goes on brother R's talking
[2:27] about um
[2:30] healing he
[2:32] says you accept it on the same basis as
[2:35] you do your
[2:36] healing it's by
[2:38] faith and he goes on he talks about now
[2:41] the word Soo in the Greek means to be
[2:46] saved and so you know you're saved he
[2:49] said it's just like materially saved or
[2:51] spiritually saved you're saved
[2:53] [Music]
[2:56] Soo and he talks about
[3:00] people in the Bible that uh the woman at
[3:02] the whale I'm sorry the woman that had
[3:05] the issue of blood he was talking about
[3:07] her and said your sa your faith has
[3:09] saved thee he said he saved her from a
[3:11] premature grave just the same as same as
[3:15] he saved you from Hell Soo the same
[3:17] Greek word means to be
[3:20] saved thy faith has Soo saved thee from
[3:23] sickness and so the word Soo is one of
[3:26] things I want to I want to look at today
[3:29] and you know when you look at the word
[3:31] to it means to be saved it means to be
[3:33] to rescue to deliver to heal or to make
[3:38] whole and it means to also means to
[3:41] protect to keep alive preserve life or
[3:44] be made whole to rescue or deliver from
[3:47] danger or harm to preserve or Guard from
[3:50] injury destruction or
[3:53] loss so when you when people talk about
[3:55] being
[3:57] saved um you know people people just
[4:00] want to be saved because they don't want
[4:02] to go to hell but they don't want all
[4:04] the aspects of what it means to be saved
[4:07] and a lot of people they don't
[4:08] understand what it means to be saved
[4:10] because you know um when you when you
[4:14] understand a lot of people think when
[4:16] you in a way of looking at Salvation
[4:19] people act like you know we owe a debt
[4:22] we could not
[4:23] pay we owed a debt but that debt was
[4:27] life or death
[4:29] it's not like we owe a
[4:32] bill it's not like you just owe somebody
[4:35] money and it's like well somebody paid
[4:37] that bill for
[4:38] you no it was a it was a life or death
[4:44] situation and so you know it's when you
[4:47] when you're facing that and somebody
[4:50] delivers you from that just like brother
[4:52] Brandon was talking about the man that
[4:55] was in the
[4:56] river and he was talking about you know
[4:58] you got to get the man out of of the
[5:00] river and then you got to get the river
[5:02] out of the
[5:03] man so so there was a because when you
[5:07] look at being it says to rescue well
[5:10] when you talking about pulling somebody
[5:12] out you have to realize that you're in
[5:14] danger the kind of situation you were in
[5:18] because when you look at the situation
[5:20] that Adam and Eve was in Adam and Eve
[5:23] was in a is in the perfect sit
[5:26] environment perfect situation here they
[5:27] are in in G of Eden everything's perfect
[5:31] there's no
[5:33] problems but brother Brenham said
[5:35] because of the choice that they made
[5:38] they had a choice to make he said they
[5:40] wanted they wanted to know what it was
[5:42] like to have
[5:44] wisdom because they wanted to understand
[5:48] something that God hadn't brought them
[5:49] to
[5:51] yet and so they got outside the plan of
[5:53] God well here they are they're in danger
[5:56] well the next thing you know they
[5:58] fall there's this great Chasm between
[6:00] them and
[6:02] God there's a way that they can't get
[6:06] back brother said they lost the eternal
[6:09] life the access to eternal life here
[6:11] they are in the garden this great place
[6:16] everything's perfect but now they're in
[6:19] danger this situation this great chasms
[6:21] between them and
[6:23] God they're they're they have fallen
[6:26] from the condition that God put them in
[6:29] because of their own their own
[6:31] fault right because of their own
[6:35] desires and here he is and he said see
[6:37] they lost their claims on on eternal
[6:40] life in their flesh and he said see here
[6:42] they are and he said the only way that
[6:44] keeps you and I from dying is that we
[6:46] have to have the same eternal
[6:48] life we're in the same condition and you
[6:51] brother R talks about that you know we
[6:53] see that they were in there because of
[6:56] them believing a false word it led to
[7:00] their
[7:01] death because here was God everything
[7:04] don't partake of this
[7:07] tree everything else in the midst is
[7:09] good for you but there's this one thing
[7:12] that you've got to stay away
[7:15] from this tree of
[7:18] knowledge it's not for
[7:21] you but that's what was but that's what
[7:23] they were drawn to the serpent came to
[7:26] talk to Eve about what God had said
[7:31] well she should have known right then as
[7:33] well surely surely God won't let you
[7:36] die right well have you considered this
[7:40] tree have you considered this tree God
[7:43] said stay away from it that should have
[7:46] that should have sealed the deal right
[7:47] then that should that should have
[7:49] cleared it all
[7:51] up and it's like you know we don't even
[7:53] want to get close to
[7:55] that wein got time to talk about that
[7:58] God said St away from
[8:00] it but see then when she began to listen
[8:03] to to the Serpent's
[8:06] reasoning oh this is great look how
[8:08] wonderful it
[8:10] is then all of a sudden see then she got
[8:13] into a place where she was listening to
[8:16] the Serpent's lie and she began to
[8:18] partake of
[8:19] that when she should have stayed away
[8:22] from
[8:23] it see they
[8:25] had and it's the same way with you and I
[8:28] we have to realize the condition that
[8:30] we're in because of the Fall we were all
[8:33] put in that condition all mankind all
[8:36] creation fail so here we are today
[8:39] brother bam said you know he said well
[8:40] we want to blame Adam and Eve for the
[8:42] fall you know it's all their fault no
[8:44] it's your fault right this morning life
[8:48] and death lays before you your choice is
[8:51] to between life and death you have to
[8:53] decide whether you're going to accept
[8:54] this or not right because God judged
[8:58] Adam and Eve but today he judges you and
[9:00] I on our choice life and death lays
[9:04] before each one of us today and and it's
[9:07] our choice whether we're going to accept
[9:09] it or
[9:11] not and so when you when you look at
[9:13] this as you see the condition because
[9:16] many people don't see that because
[9:17] that's the LIE of the
[9:19] devil because people don't realize the
[9:22] condition that they're
[9:23] in because you know if if you see the
[9:26] danger just like brother talking about
[9:28] you know you see somebody that's going
[9:29] over the falls you know they're they're
[9:31] facing the falls and you're out there
[9:33] trying to tell them listen you just
[9:34] can't go out there and tell them now
[9:36] listen buddy your brother you're getting
[9:37] too close to the falls you know there's
[9:40] D no he said you'd be out there
[9:42] screaming and yelling if you could you
[9:43] get a hold of them and drag them out
[9:46] right you got time you ain't got time
[9:47] because if you see the danger there you
[9:49] ain't got time to talk to them and try
[9:52] to convince
[9:54] them you'd want to get them
[9:57] out just like he was talking about your
[9:59] child playing in the road if you saw him
[10:01] out there in the road you know you just
[10:03] don't go out there and say well Junior
[10:06] dear I think you shouldn't be doing
[10:10] that well you know it's like like
[10:14] me Richard I get to preach on Richard I
[10:17] get talk about Richard on I told him I
[10:20] said if you ever done this you can talk
[10:21] about me but he don't get
[10:24] to but you know when I was little you
[10:27] know Richard had me putting rocks on the
[10:30] yellow lines in the middle of the
[10:34] highway but you
[10:35] know I didn't see the danger which I
[10:38] don't even I I don't hardly even
[10:40] remember
[10:41] this but brother but Brother Richard
[10:45] Douglas's dad brother Joe he saw me he
[10:49] saw the
[10:50] danger and you know he didn't he didn't
[10:53] have he didn't have shoes on or nothing
[10:55] but he saw me out there in the middle of
[10:57] the road and Paul Paul just come run as
[11:00] hard as he could and scoop me up out of
[11:01] the road and took me
[11:05] home but you know it wasn't it wasn't
[11:07] that he you know because he didn't come
[11:09] out there and try to talk to me or
[11:11] nothing he just saw the danger and the
[11:12] first thing was he reacted to it to get
[11:15] me out of the out of the way and
[11:18] sometimes you know because God comes to
[11:19] us in our situation sometimes because
[11:21] you know we're just we're
[11:23] unknowledgeable we don't see the danger
[11:26] we're ignorant of the things that are
[11:28] around us
[11:29] right right but see that's the reason he
[11:31] comes to to bring us to the word to
[11:34] brings us to a knowledge of these things
[11:35] to understand listen God wants us
[11:39] to follow him to you know it's like
[11:43] sometimes like well I don't understand
[11:45] why things happen the way they do or
[11:47] whatever it's like trust God he's got
[11:50] your best interest at heart it's and you
[11:52] know you see and you look back over the
[11:54] things of life and and it's like well
[11:56] you know I wasn't I wasn't smart enough
[11:57] to figure that out on my own
[12:00] but you know I trusted God right God
[12:03] come along my path when I couldn't when
[12:06] I couldn't save
[12:08] myself and he was able to get me out of
[12:11] out of this
[12:13] situation and it's like you know what
[12:15] because
[12:16] because you know the Devil he's very
[12:19] shrewd he's he's very smart very
[12:21] intelligent and he knows what all our
[12:23] weaknesses are he knows what all our
[12:26] problems are and he knows how to work
[12:28] everything
[12:30] but I'm so glad I got one I can trust I
[12:33] can lean
[12:34] on I put my my confidence in
[12:38] him but many people you know they they
[12:41] just want they just want to have this um
[12:44] they just want to have to be saved but
[12:46] they don't want to but they don't want
[12:47] to entail take what it all
[12:51] entails because you know it's like well
[12:53] I just want as brother Brenham said
[12:55] here and we'll get to it maybe this
[12:58] morning but you know he talks about you
[13:00] know people want to be saved but they
[13:02] don't want a
[13:05] lord they they just they want salvation
[13:07] because they want to be saved from
[13:09] something but you know if you but you
[13:12] see you if
[13:13] you if you if you look at Salvation you
[13:16] know when when you talk to
[13:18] people it's like you you see people that
[13:22] need to be saved and and you're and
[13:23] you're trying to tell them listen this
[13:25] is you need to be saved and you you see
[13:27] the condition they in and people say
[13:31] well I I I don't know what to do about
[13:34] this and it's like listen if you if you
[13:37] get a
[13:38] savior you know then he can he can lead
[13:41] and guide you in these
[13:43] things but you you got to start
[13:47] somewhere you know and just like there
[13:50] in the in the book of
[13:52] Acts when when they began to
[13:56] speak in in Acts chapter two
[14:00] there when when Peter and the and the
[14:02] disciples were
[14:04] there and you know when in the day of
[14:06] Pentecost had fully come and then when
[14:09] the Holy Ghost had fallen on the on the
[14:12] people on the 120 and you know they
[14:15] began to act very odd and you know they
[14:17] come out into the street and everybody's
[14:19] trying to figure out you know who are
[14:20] these people and why are they acting
[14:22] this way and you know they thought well
[14:24] these people are full of new wine
[14:25] they're just drunk and you know it's
[14:27] like you know we still these drunk
[14:29] people in the middle of the day and you
[14:31] know every it become a
[14:34] spectacle but you know Peter stood up
[14:36] with the 11 and and he said he said ye
[14:39] men of Judea and all that dwell at
[14:42] Jerusalem he said be this known unto you
[14:45] and hearken unto my words for these are
[14:47] not drunken as you suppose sing that but
[14:49] it is but the third hour of the day but
[14:52] this is that which was spoken of by the
[14:54] prophet Joel and he said it shall come
[14:56] to pass in the last day saith God I will
[14:58] pour out my my spirit upon All Flesh and
[15:01] your sons and your daughters shall
[15:02] prophesy and your young men shall see
[15:04] visions and your old men shall dream
[15:06] dreams and on my servants and on my
[15:09] handmaidens will I pour out in those
[15:11] days of my spirit and they shall
[15:15] prophesy so here he goes when he's begin
[15:18] to speak of these things that was taking
[15:19] place and he takes them back to the Old
[15:20] Testament and began to show what was
[15:22] going to take place and then right after
[15:25] this we see that Peter drops down he
[15:28] says and it shall come to pass that
[15:30] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[15:32] the Lord shall be
[15:33] saved and so people say well you know we
[15:36] just call upon the name of the Lord but
[15:38] the you know right after that he begins
[15:41] to speak and he says ye men of Israel
[15:44] hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man
[15:46] approved of God among you by whom
[15:49] Miracles and wonders and signs which God
[15:52] did by him in the midst of you as you
[15:55] yourselves also know so when he comes in
[15:58] there and he says but who calls upon the
[15:59] name of the Lord shall be saved but the
[16:01] next thing that is right after that the
[16:03] first thing he does is Peter turns
[16:05] around and points him right back to
[16:07] Jesus and he begins to tell them all the
[16:10] scripture about the things that David
[16:11] had written in in the Psalms and was
[16:13] begin to talk about what what the word
[16:16] that was written of Jesus Christ and how
[16:18] Jesus Christ in his life he fulfilled
[16:20] exactly what was prophesied of him to do
[16:22] and he began to show them the hour and
[16:25] the day that they lived because the word
[16:27] was what brought them to that place to
[16:29] show them what was taking place and this
[16:32] is the Fulfillment of Joel because it's
[16:35] the outpouring because it was the
[16:37] promise of the scripture the Messiah has
[16:40] come and the life that he lived will now
[16:42] come upon the
[16:45] believer and he says then and he
[16:48] says when he begins to speak of that in
[16:50] verse 36 he says therefore let all the
[16:53] house of Israel know assuredly that God
[16:55] hath made that same Jesus whom ye have
[16:58] crucified ified both Lord and
[17:02] Christ so he begins to identify who his
[17:05] who he is the position the prophecy of
[17:08] the word that's taking place because
[17:10] this spectacle is taking place but it's
[17:12] the Fulfillment of word of the word of
[17:14] God and he says he said now when they
[17:16] heard this they were pricked in their
[17:18] heart and they said unto Peter and to
[17:20] the rest of the disciples men and
[17:21] Brethren what shall we do then Peter
[17:24] said unto them just believe
[17:30] hu we just just believe on well that's
[17:32] what that's what he said up here he said
[17:34] he said whoever calls on the name of the
[17:35] Lord shall be
[17:37] saved but it took more than
[17:40] that just we just we just believe on the
[17:43] Lord and and that gives us
[17:46] salvation but no if you if you continue
[17:49] in the word right because that's what
[17:52] that's what he said in John he said if
[17:54] you continue in my word he said then
[17:56] you're my disciples indeed right right
[17:59] he said then you'll know the truth and
[18:01] the truth will set you
[18:02] free so you got to continue in that so
[18:06] he said well because I I was listening
[18:08] to this man talking about
[18:11] um you know I don't know if y'all if
[18:14] y'all ever heard this term or not but um
[18:17] if y'all have ever heard the term
[18:18] lordship
[18:22] salvation but uh we may get into that uh
[18:26] I'm supposed to speak Wednesday night so
[18:28] we may get into a little bit of that on
[18:29] Wednesday Lord but um when you when you
[18:33] see this you know because when you look
[18:35] at salvation Salvation is not just one
[18:38] this this one part and it's like well
[18:40] you're being free from something no
[18:43] there's more there's more involved in
[18:44] Salvation than just just this you know
[18:47] being free from something I've been
[18:50] saved but you there's there because you
[18:52] don't understand the full scope of what
[18:55] that means so here when they when you're
[18:58] talking about calling on the name of the
[18:59] Lord shall be saved and when he began to
[19:01] preach the word Peter says you've got to
[19:04] repent
[19:06] right so what does that mean you've got
[19:08] to change the way you think the way you
[19:10] look at things right you because brother
[19:13] R said you got to make a a total change
[19:15] in your
[19:16] life to repent of the things that that
[19:19] you
[19:20] were and so when you say when it what
[19:22] does it mean to repent it means to
[19:25] change it me you because I I I want to
[19:28] change my ways I want I realize because
[19:31] when you realize listen I'm not where I
[19:34] need to
[19:35] be and I am I'm insufficient to do the
[19:38] things that I have to
[19:40] do I have to have somebody to Lead Me
[19:44] amen I've got to have somebody to pull
[19:46] me out right when you come to the
[19:48] realization because you know if like
[19:50] that man was drowning in the river well
[19:53] if he could get himself out he wouldn't
[19:54] be drowning
[19:56] right but when he come to realization
[19:59] that he needed somebody then somebody
[20:01] could come and help
[20:04] him just like just like brother R
[20:06] talking about people that you you try to
[20:08] show people that you know because of the
[20:10] situation that they're in it's like
[20:13] spiritually they're
[20:14] naked they're they're
[20:17] inadequate and it's like well you just
[20:19] tend to your own
[20:22] Affairs well if you saw somebody walking
[20:24] down the street you know they're not in
[20:25] their right mind cuz they ain't got
[20:26] their clothes on right
[20:30] and you try to go and help them like
[20:32] brother R said well you just you just
[20:33] take care of your own
[20:35] business because you've got to realize
[20:38] that you're not in the right place and
[20:41] you got to realize the danger that
[20:42] you're
[20:44] in because you tell people listen you're
[20:46] not we're not promised the rest of the
[20:49] day that's right we're not we're not
[20:51] we're not promised tomorrow brother R
[20:53] said if we woke up this morning you know
[20:55] we' to outlive a lot of kids a lot of
[20:58] teenagers
[21:01] there's a there's a lot of kids that
[21:02] won't make it through the
[21:04] day we're not promised tomorrow and if
[21:06] you and salvate today is the day of
[21:08] salvation if you plan on being right
[21:10] with God today the day to do that amen
[21:13] it's like well I'll take care of that no
[21:14] you ain't got time to take care of it
[21:15] later right when you come to the place
[21:18] of realizing you've got to be right with
[21:20] God because you don't have another day
[21:23] you don't know if you're going to draw
[21:24] another
[21:26] breath when you when you come to the
[21:28] realiz ation of how close it how serious
[21:30] it is that you've got to be
[21:32] saved that you've got to know that you
[21:35] know that you
[21:37] know you've got to you've got to have
[21:39] everything because when like brother
[21:41] said when you get to the river you don't
[21:43] want to have no River trouble you don't
[21:45] have no no problems crossing the
[21:48] river you don't want to get down there
[21:50] and think oh well you know because the
[21:52] preacher or or somebody said that I that
[21:54] I was
[21:56] okay you've got to know that for
[21:58] yourself
[21:59] there's not anybody else because that's
[22:01] between you and
[22:03] God and nobody else can tell you that
[22:05] that that you're
[22:08] okay see when you when you have you if
[22:11] you repent he said repent and be
[22:14] baptized every one of you in the name of
[22:17] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[22:18] sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[22:21] the Holy Ghost he said for the promise
[22:23] is unto you and to your children and to
[22:25] them that are far off even as many as
[22:27] the Lord Our God show shall
[22:29] call see when you have to understand
[22:33] see this is from the message proving his
[22:38] word says see a lot of people he said
[22:42] see a lot of people want Jesus to be
[22:44] their savior but not their lord see Lord
[22:47] is ruler yeah you say Jesus you saved me
[22:51] and let me stand right here and that's
[22:53] all right and I'll do my own business
[22:57] now you don't get in my business but you
[23:00] can be my savior but my but not my
[23:05] Lord he said he wants to be your lord
[23:08] you see then he's your
[23:11] savior so if you want a savior you've
[23:14] got to have a lord right because that's
[23:18] the only way that it works because as we
[23:20] were talking about the men drowning in
[23:21] the river you know the the if anybody's
[23:26] ever looked at you know been lifeguard
[23:29] or U people that do that kind of work
[23:31] you know you've got to get people to
[23:33] when when you're a lifeguard and you
[23:35] jump in and you're trying to save
[23:37] somebody if you're doing a water rescue
[23:39] and you're in there trying to get
[23:40] somebody you got to get that person to
[23:42] cooperate with you
[23:45] right because if they are uncooperative
[23:48] because if they're just fling in the
[23:49] water and they're
[23:51] panicking you can't save them right amen
[23:55] because you know you can give them you
[23:57] can give them your Flo of us and you
[23:59] tell them to H but you know what if they
[24:01] get a hold of you and they're not calm
[24:03] and they don't have confidence in you
[24:05] they'll drown
[24:08] you you can't save them so the thing is
[24:12] is you've got to get to the place where
[24:13] you have confidence in this person that
[24:16] you hey I can I can get you
[24:19] out and you got to you got to want to if
[24:23] anybody's everever been in that
[24:24] situation where you know you're you're
[24:27] down below the water and you're trying
[24:28] to get out and you can't breathe and
[24:30] you're ready to get you any anybody you
[24:33] just tell me what to do when we'll do it
[24:36] I'll cooperate with
[24:40] you you know you have to have but you
[24:42] got to be in that situation where you
[24:43] want to right and see when you when
[24:47] you're able to do that you give then the
[24:49] Lifeguard when he gets in the water then
[24:51] he can help you and many times it's like
[24:54] listen all you got to do is rest and
[24:56] relax amen and trust in him and then you
[24:59] know what that person can get you
[25:02] out and then all of a sudden you know
[25:04] they you hanging on and all of a sudden
[25:06] they're doing they're doing the work
[25:08] they get you
[25:10] out because they know what they're doing
[25:13] it's like lots of times people get
[25:14] caught in rip
[25:15] ties it's like well I'm a good swimmer I
[25:18] think I can do this until you get in
[25:21] water that's faster than you stronger
[25:23] than you right and people don't know how
[25:25] to get out because they'll go the wrong
[25:27] way
[25:29] because they think well I I'm just going
[25:31] to go in this direction but the only way
[25:34] there's but if you're going to get out
[25:35] of a rip tide what you got to go
[25:37] perpendicular to the force if it's
[25:40] pulling you on way you got to try to get
[25:42] out because many people they want to go
[25:44] the opposite
[25:45] direction and that's not going to
[25:48] work but see if you if you know those
[25:50] things but you got to know what
[25:52] direction to get
[25:53] out you see if if somebody's there to
[25:56] help you then they can get you in the
[25:58] right direction but you've got to have
[26:01] somebody that can show you to do
[26:03] that and I'm I want I want to finish
[26:06] with this this is from Romans chapter
[26:10] 10 verse 11 says for the scripture
[26:12] sayith whosoever believeth on him shall
[26:15] not be ashamed he said for there is no
[26:18] difference between the Jew and the Greek
[26:20] for the same Lord over all is Rich unto
[26:22] all that call upon him for whosoever
[26:25] shall call upon the name of the Lord
[26:27] shall be saved
[26:28] how then shall they call on him in who
[26:31] they have not believed how shall they
[26:34] believe in him of whom they have not
[26:37] heard and how shall they hear without a
[26:39] preacher amen and how shall they preach
[26:42] except they be sent at is written how
[26:44] beautiful are the feet of them that
[26:46] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[26:48] Glad Tidings of good things he said but
[26:51] they have not all obeyed the gospel for
[26:53] Isaiah sayith Lord who hath believed our
[26:56] report so then Faith cometh by by
[26:58] hearing and hearing by the word of
[27:01] God so when we see this scripture here
[27:05] see you have to hear the
[27:07] word and somebody has to bring you the
[27:11] word and who can if you don't hear the
[27:13] word then how can you believe right and
[27:16] somebody's got to be sent to bring the
[27:19] word to you and you've got to hear the
[27:21] word and believe the
[27:22] Worden and so it takes it takes the the
[27:26] word being spoken
[27:29] and so somebody's got to come and bring
[27:30] the word to you for you to understand
[27:32] and believe the word faith cometh by
[27:35] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[27:38] and so we understand that if we see that
[27:39] the word has come then it's for us to
[27:42] believe it right and thank God we have a
[27:44] Ministry that brings the word to us but
[27:47] you
[27:52] know but like brother B said you know if
[27:55] you can't preach a sermon then live a
[27:57] sermon
[28:00] and that's what God wants us to
[28:02] do we are we're that living breathing
[28:05] instrumentality of Jesus Christ showing
[28:08] the world who Jesus Christ is not some
[28:13] idea not what what somebody else
[28:17] thinks but a real true living experience
[28:21] of Jesus
[28:23] Christ because you know there's a lot
[28:26] that can be spoke on and we'll have the
[28:30] musicians will come now you know there's
[28:32] a lot of people that want to talk about
[28:34] a lot of things but you know what you
[28:36] can't you can't argue with a life
[28:38] lived when you see that true
[28:42] experience cuz and that's what that's
[28:45] what people they may might
[28:47] argue the scripture but they can't when
[28:50] they see a life
[28:52] lived when they see a true experience
[28:54] and that's what that's what my desire is
[28:56] to see to show people
[28:59] that we people can see Jesus Christ in
[29:01] us not just some
[29:03] idea that they may see Jesus Christ in
[29:07] all of us amen well God bless you this
[29:10] morning
[29:11] [Applause]
