[19:18] we love you and we thank you and we
[19:20] commit everything to you now in Jesus
[19:23] name Amen
[19:28] Russians three verse nine why not one to
[19:36] another seeing that you have put off the
[19:39] old man with his deeds and have put on
[19:43] the new man which is renewed in
[19:46] knowledge after the image of him that
[19:50] created him where there is neither now
[19:53] in him was not there is neither Greek
[19:56] nor Jew circumcision uncircumcision
[19:59] barbarian Cynthia never how you
[20:02] pronounce those words there bond nor
[20:05] free the Christ is all and in all Christ
[20:12] is all and in all
[20:15] okay now let's go to Corinthians 15
[20:23] we'll begin to verse 20 but now is
[20:29] Christ risen from the dead and become
[20:31] the firstfruits of them that slept for
[20:34] since by man came death by man came also
[20:37] the resurrection of the dead whereas as
[20:41] in Adam all die even so in Christ shall
[20:44] all be made alive every man in his own
[20:48] order Christ the firstfruits afterward
[20:51] they that are Christ's at his coming now
[20:55] I want you to think about all and in all
[20:59] I want you to think about that he's
[21:02] describing here the whole situation
[21:05] because he describes Christ Adam you
[21:09] know now he's describing never a man
[21:12] after his own order Christ the
[21:14] firstfruits afterward they that it
[21:15] that is coming then cometh the end when
[21:19] he shall have delivered up the kingdom
[21:21] to God even the father when he shall
[21:24] have put down all rule and all authority
[21:26] and power for he must reign till he hath
[21:30] put all enemies under his feet the last
[21:35] enemy that shall be destroyed is death
[21:39] for he hath put all things under his
[21:41] feet but when he set all things were put
[21:44] under him it is manifest that he is
[21:47] excepted which did put all things under
[21:50] him and when all things shall be subdued
[21:54] unto Him then she oldest son also
[21:57] becomes subject unto him that put all
[21:59] things under him that God may be all in
[22:04] all you may be seated the Lord of his
[22:07] and his blessing to the reading of the
[22:10] word now we tried to do this morning you
[22:16] know cause of company drop back but we
[22:21] didn't drop it far back now as we you
[22:23] maybe would think because we were trying
[22:25] to make sure you follow the line up and
[22:30] follow the importance of what is being
[22:35] said so we were covering the end that
[22:38] the prophet said God came in three sons
[22:42] named son of man son of God son of David
[22:47] all right now three sons names now that
[22:51] doesn't mean that we believe in many
[22:54] gods all right it's just one true and
[22:57] living God correct
[22:58] all right now also it doesn't mean that
[23:03] we are you know trying to go and bring
[23:09] any thought adding to the point of what
[23:14] is saying because it's three sons now
[23:18] God has many manifestations right
[23:23] whatever manifestation now listen ever
[23:28] manifestation that God has will fall
[23:32] under one of those manifestations of the
[23:37] three sons all right Son of Man will
[23:42] cover the bases of the prophets all of
[23:47] the things that's in there we've tried
[23:50] not to extend out into great length is
[23:53] maybe you think I try to do I I try to
[23:56] cut back and maybe I need to but you
[24:00] know you could spend months preaching
[24:02] from the Old Testament of son of man and
[24:04] then get into the New Testament and how
[24:06] this verse after verse I asked you if
[24:08] you would to just read Matthew Mark Luke
[24:12] and John and notice the things that it
[24:15] spoke of constantly of son of man you
[24:19] know the son of mensis or the seed the
[24:21] son of man that is so Amanda that the
[24:24] whole thing is relation to that point
[24:27] all right then you know like I said it
[24:33] all would be covered under son of man
[24:35] son of God
[24:38] you could preach off of that we have
[24:42] about who he is and what happened and
[24:45] what's taking place and the different
[24:47] things all right - son of David for the
[24:53] millennial reign to fulfill the the
[24:55] scriptures are promised to David you
[24:58] know that his son which in the natural
[25:00] was Solomon said on his throne but that
[25:03] was not the son that he was speaking of
[25:05] it was Jesus Christ to set in the
[25:09] millennial reign alright so we spent you
[25:13] know time this morning trying to pick
[25:16] that up a little to make sure you follow
[25:19] the example we're talking about all
[25:22] right now see then it's very vital to
[25:25] understand as I said all manifestations
[25:27] will fall under one of those three
[25:31] examples son of man son of God son of
[25:35] David all right now it will cover many
[25:39] things now God has many ways
[25:42] revealing himself now he has three it
[25:46] was said three sons names but he comes
[25:50] in three or he comes in four titles
[25:55] right he comes in four titles and you
[25:59] take C and bring it in and you bring in
[26:02] son of Abraham I'll get to that in a
[26:06] minute and the message and you place him
[26:08] within and then brother branham gives
[26:09] you which one of which is what it is and
[26:12] who that is error the earth which is the
[26:14] son of God
[26:15] alright now because he has many titles
[26:19] at least those four that we would list
[26:23] he has many manifestations so keep that
[26:28] in your your mind and you won't get try
[26:31] to limit to a point of stopping
[26:34] somewhere alright you may not think it's
[26:37] important to understand but I've given
[26:41] you the example over and over to try to
[26:45] make that clear that how are you going
[26:49] to go from one manifestation to another
[26:54] the it was necessary not that then he
[26:58] come to Holy Ghost in the Old Testament
[27:00] it was necessary to come as son of man
[27:03] and then it when you would come in to
[27:07] the Matthew Mark Luke and John it would
[27:09] do that with son of man who'd eventually
[27:12] out of son of man I am
[27:13] alright then you would go from dire to -
[27:17] by him giving his life then he could
[27:21] come on the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[27:22] from there Pentecost to be son of God
[27:26] okay now everybody following that
[27:29] thought because that spirit God are the
[27:32] new birth now you're going to son of a
[27:36] son of God through the ages the next
[27:39] step in the three sons names would go to
[27:42] son of David in the Millennium so you're
[27:45] changing totally from the Gentile
[27:48] dispensation over to the Jewish
[27:52] dispensation or time so you're going
[27:55] to pick up a well how are you going to
[27:58] go from son of God the Son of David I've
[28:03] asked that point it may not be in vital
[28:05] to you but it's very vital to me to be
[28:07] able to tie together all the scriptures
[28:09] because you've got to keep them in
[28:11] correct line but it doesn't mean maybe
[28:14] that much did you but I remember i
[28:16] illustrate it like this when you're
[28:19] talking about the coming of God so you
[28:22] got many manifestations in the coming of
[28:24] God he comes for his bride he come come
[28:28] to redeem him he come to her to get his
[28:30] bride he comes with his bride he comes
[28:34] to the Jews in the Millennium you know
[28:36] in the tribulation then he comes to the
[28:39] with the Jews in the Millennium so
[28:41] there's five things that you're talking
[28:43] about the coming of the Lord now it's
[28:47] very vital to make sure those scriptures
[28:50] don't cross each other because what if
[28:54] you're using a scripture that applies to
[28:57] the coming of God to the Jews yet you
[29:00] read you a scripture of where he's
[29:02] coming to the Gentiles you know the
[29:05] bride or you know with the brown Hornet
[29:07] see you're totally out of the word
[29:10] that's what I said that may not mean
[29:12] anything to you but I believe it did to
[29:15] the Prophet and it does to me to be able
[29:18] to keep things in line and then you say
[29:21] without risks brother Dale tell me what
[29:22] to the screw well I have to sit down and
[29:24] look on that for quite a while to be
[29:27] able to catch up which way it's going
[29:30] but it will a line of then each one has
[29:33] its meaning and ways of expressing
[29:36] itself all right so then to me it's very
[29:40] vital to understand because listen you
[29:43] understand what I'm saying you go from
[29:45] son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[29:48] you got to have between Dyer and go into
[29:53] Israel look you know the Millennium look
[29:55] what you got a high/low look what you'd
[29:58] be this just what do you need your son
[29:59] of God down to the church ages and then
[30:04] you'd miss the rapture you know
[30:08] the saying you wind up in the Millennium
[30:11] you know bad supper you get all of those
[30:14] things and you'd wind up in the
[30:16] Millennium huh
[30:18] and so you wouldn't understand how you
[30:20] get tired go ride so how do you get dark
[30:25] so all right so the Prophet when he
[30:28] brought it I've read it over and over to
[30:30] you off of the unveiling of God to where
[30:32] he would be using the sort of God a son
[30:36] of man son of God he said in between
[30:42] this he comes back that son of man all
[30:50] right now son of man is in relationship
[30:53] to the rapture changing the body all of
[30:58] the things to getting us prepared far as
[31:02] the future home are you following me
[31:05] please so look what you'd be missing but
[31:09] by taking the Prophet and letting him
[31:12] wedge it in it's not an addition to what
[31:15] he's saying
[31:15] because I said everything is covered
[31:17] either son of man son of God son of
[31:19] David all right so now we've got it
[31:23] lined up to what son of man prophet
[31:27] coming to Israel coming down in Jesus
[31:30] Christ giving his life etc son of God
[31:34] seven churches you right in the end town
[31:37] just in the last days this age he comes
[31:41] back as son of man for just a little
[31:43] while the Prophet said and look what it
[31:46] does then it comes to bring in the
[31:48] Prophet and his message and all he's
[31:50] bringing in relation to the son of man
[31:54] then you can go to the son of David till
[32:00] you see that away you've got something
[32:01] to carry you from one stage to the next
[32:03] stage to the next stage all right so now
[32:07] if everybody got that in line to where
[32:09] we could at least mentally you would
[32:11] understand me as to what I'm saying
[32:14] without that son of man I don't want to
[32:18] use the word injected but brother Ron
[32:21] said returns
[32:22] that was his way of saying it returned
[32:25] here between this what between the Son
[32:29] of God and son of David
[32:33] God returns at son of man to bring us
[32:37] this message in the end time and to
[32:40] bring us to a change of the body bring
[32:43] us to a rapture all right and put us
[32:48] into the Millennium it's this message
[32:52] who puts a star in other words read run
[32:54] says whatever puts the bra I'll push the
[32:56] Israel in the Millennium you know we'll
[32:59] put the bride in the Millennium alright
[33:02] what is that the opening of the word so
[33:06] what will Israel do now watch the point
[33:09] when they receive Christ after we leave
[33:12] they will see those two prophets son of
[33:16] man all right not the prophets is no
[33:19] come on we we got it right we can follow
[33:21] it but he'll see God dealing through
[33:24] those two prophets then they'll say that
[33:27] God died understand but it Reynolds says
[33:30] questions and answers silver he said
[33:33] they'll see and they'll realize they
[33:35] missed it
[33:37] all right through those two prophets
[33:39] standing there and and revealing and
[33:43] knowing where they're standing then they
[33:46] will then see Christ as it supposed to
[33:49] be they pull up for wheat for days to
[33:52] fulfill the scripture and as they do
[33:54] then he comes to them now listen he
[33:57] comes to Israel as son of God are you
[34:03] following me the baptism with the Holy
[34:05] Ghost they get the baptism with the Holy
[34:08] Ghost 144,000 does not make them bride
[34:12] make some servants but they get eternal
[34:15] life here right now are you following it
[34:20] so look at the perfection see of the way
[34:23] the Prophet would bring it see then they
[34:26] get the two witnesses son of man they
[34:29] see through that that they need they've
[34:31] killed their Messiah and then they say
[34:35] that
[34:35] we've already received Christ and gone
[34:38] and they see their hopes is resting in
[34:40] that son of God to them all right see
[34:44] then they'll go to seeing that in this
[34:48] age in this age the bride would come
[34:54] back to being the son of man no we've
[34:57] been over that and over that trying to
[34:59] get you see it so see Israel's gonna get
[35:03] it what God I mean son of man son of God
[35:07] son of man something David you're not
[35:10] adding one thing to it because
[35:12] everything is involved in the three sons
[35:14] names so they get it it's the same way
[35:19] we get it they get eternal life here
[35:24] right and under that eternal life to
[35:28] them two witnesses and the ministering
[35:30] they come to a basis of seeing of what
[35:34] really happened and how the son of man
[35:36] is entire as so interlace into
[35:40] everything until it will bring them to
[35:44] work they will walk off the earth right
[35:47] and then they'll go to the Millennium
[35:50] that's on a day you know this son of
[35:51] David they'll be there as eunuchs to the
[35:54] bride so watch the same plan for Israel
[35:57] plans for the bride what puts them there
[36:01] puts us down all right so you're
[36:04] following what I'm saying now it's not
[36:06] saying what brother Dale's trying to add
[36:08] another work in there
[36:09] no three sons names son of man son of
[36:14] God son of David it's just using that to
[36:18] understand what does transpire I'm not
[36:23] the one that said that he comes back
[36:25] here for a little while as son of man
[36:28] your prophet was expressing that but
[36:32] brother Dale I've read 49 quotes there's
[36:35] three sons named and then you write
[36:38] you're not listening three
[36:44] manifestations of God son of man son of
[36:46] God son of David what does it matter
[36:48] were you moving it
[36:49] hackers info you know an added ones word
[36:54] its clarification to understand what
[36:57] it's transpired all right this it's
[37:05] given us to an understand so you see how
[37:07] vital it is to understand we now have
[37:11] the plan because he you don't you
[37:14] you wouldn't be relating to word it out
[37:18] way I think I told you about it when I
[37:21] started studying this message and I
[37:24] studied it and studied it and I searched
[37:26] and when brother Brandon said three sons
[37:29] nine I could read I listened to the
[37:33] tapes I could follow that example a
[37:35] three sons night son of man son of God
[37:38] son today but I knew that you could go
[37:42] from son of man that would give his life
[37:45] to die for us to come into this
[37:50] dispensation of son of God but I
[37:54] couldn't follow it no way to be able to
[37:57] go from son of God the new birth and put
[38:00] us into the Millennium because that
[38:04] would be the next step and I thought
[38:07] Lord there's too much left there's
[38:09] something wrong how are we going to be
[38:11] changed what are we gonna do what's
[38:13] gonna take place and I told you about it
[38:16] you know we were listening this tape and
[38:18] I finally heard brother Branham on the
[38:20] unveiling of God where he said God's
[38:25] going to between this in other words
[38:29] between this son of God and Son of David
[38:31] is the son of man going to return to the
[38:35] earth that to me is the most vital thing
[38:38] you could ever think of I know people
[38:42] frown and snarl up their nose and what
[38:44] does that mean do we need to understand
[38:48] it I'll let you how the pulpit show me
[38:50] how you get time let me not restore
[38:53] casting or hateful
[38:54] I'm just truthful if you can show me how
[38:57] to get there then hey let's go that away
[39:01] you got an easier
[39:03] to do it let's get at it we've had 50
[39:06] years of the attics right of people
[39:11] trying to explain all these things and
[39:13] that taking place yet so it's time to
[39:16] settle down and be serious about it well
[39:22] it'll just be this way this way we were
[39:24] just waiting on the bus to pull up we're
[39:26] waiting on this okay I'll pray to God
[39:30] he'll hurry up and get the bus here I'm
[39:32] getting old and I'll look back here and
[39:34] I see people we was life and life's not
[39:37] over - it's a fellowship meeting this
[39:40] brother was telling you know about Sean
[39:42] Sean and Wade and all of them was about
[39:45] that age I said yeah there's a gap
[39:46] bracket Dorothy
[39:48] y'all all fit into and I said you turn
[39:50] around and look there's another gap
[39:52] bracket here that's sitting here with
[39:54] great heart and we're all pruning up and
[39:56] getting ready for the nursing home we've
[40:02] had 50 years well I'm like this if I
[40:08] tried something for 50 years and it
[40:09] didn't work I'll try something else I'm
[40:15] just serious that's what I'm saying 40
[40:19] years ago God began to reveal to me this
[40:22] and he showed me how that you'd go some
[40:24] son of man son of God son of man in
[40:27] between and then it would fit - come out
[40:30] - son of David son of man then in this
[40:33] that's dispensation I preached it to you
[40:35] over and over there is no rapture
[40:37] without this message there's no change
[40:39] of the body without this message this
[40:42] message brings all of those things we
[40:45] don't have to look for something else
[40:46] it's right there in the word to
[40:49] understand all of those things all right
[40:52] but you wind up in the Millennium all
[40:56] right now swallow let's start those well
[41:02] here on out you're gonna back up a
[41:04] little I'm telling you you're gonna back
[41:07] up and wonder where I'm going don't
[41:12] worry about where I'm going you just
[41:13] listen if it's right amen if it's right
[41:16] Oh
[41:16] me my office will be open when we get
[41:19] through you sit down and talk all you
[41:22] want to but I'm going to ask you one
[41:26] simple question he winds up to the Jews
[41:30] in the Millennium as son of David right
[41:38] we will have to agree with that that's
[41:40] that's not a question I'm not asking you
[41:42] to agree I'm asking you to be smart
[41:45] enough to shake your head yes because
[41:47] that's got to be because the Prophet
[41:49] said that's the way it's going to be
[41:51] okay we go to son of David in the
[41:55] Millennium all right you're still in
[41:58] time you're still under a seven the
[42:02] millennial reign is under a seven but a
[42:05] random actually covers the seventh
[42:06] Church age and talks about it being
[42:09] under the number seven and because it
[42:11] cares it right on the end of the
[42:12] millennium because it's still under time
[42:17] time has us all sealed in a bracket of
[42:22] death we're dying every time that clock
[42:29] go take that heart go don't don't don't
[42:33] do and every time they go don't don't
[42:37] it's wiring out om you'll have it don't
[42:42] worry about it
[42:47] just listen - horrible - night now just
[42:52] asking you a simple question how about -
[42:58] future home
[43:05] now we're gonna set with him around the
[43:08] throne in the Millennium right right I
[43:12] mean yeah that has to be agreed that
[43:16] means yeah okay brother Donny Reagan
[43:20] said one time he said you do like that
[43:22] that means a big Amen now what kind of a
[43:30] situation you're gonna exist in in the
[43:32] future home
[43:36] and I asked you a question how you gonna
[43:38] get there I just read your scripture
[43:49] that makes an outstanding statement but
[43:56] did you listen I just read your
[44:02] scripture and I'm going to use my
[44:04] terminologies and I'll back it up and
[44:05] the right way but for you to understand
[44:08] I just read your scriptures there's
[44:12] gonna be a time come that the sonship is
[44:16] going to terminate terminate is not a
[44:27] correct word I told you I'd use my
[44:29] wordings I don't have anymore but the
[44:33] son has got to become subdued or under
[44:39] subjection come on let's reread that
[44:45] pull it back up and Corinthians brother
[44:49] look first Corinthians 15
[44:57] he's laying down 20 verse coming through
[45:01] he's laying down that Christ has risen
[45:03] from the dead and become the firstfruits
[45:04] for them to slip comes over into us for
[45:07] since by man came death Adam by man came
[45:12] also the resurrection of the Dead Christ
[45:14] the Son of man coming into being to word
[45:17] he could give his life to pay the price
[45:19] no where is in Adam all die even so in
[45:25] Christ shall all be made alive so we got
[45:30] to cherish that part but every man in
[45:33] his own order
[45:35] in other words got to be an order this a
[45:38] place of heart Christ the firstfruits
[45:45] now we're the firstfruits whether you
[45:48] concern he was the first fruit and we're
[45:50] the firstfruits by being in him or him
[45:52] being in us I'll get to that in a second
[45:57] afterward they that are Christ's and
[46:00] he's coming they they're to Christ and
[46:06] he's coming that's bringing in a people
[46:15] the first Adam is Christ right who's
[46:19] this Christ and he is coming
[46:28] I'd always gonna come with him I mean
[46:32] that's the best that I've always tried
[46:34] to have of that and we're gonna cover
[46:37] some scriptures it gets really hard to
[46:41] follow and then look at verse 24 then or
[46:52] at that time was shortly thereafter
[46:55] cometh the end when he shall have
[47:00] delivered up the kingdom to God even the
[47:06] father
[47:09] who need shall have put down all rule
[47:11] and all authority and power now when
[47:15] he's done this something's gonna
[47:16] transpire for he must reign who Christ
[47:26] the Lord Jesus till he hath put all
[47:30] enemies under his feet he's got a rule
[47:35] to live till all the enemies is put
[47:38] under his feet now what are these
[47:40] enemies he names them here the life tena
[47:46] me no matter how many more enemies you
[47:48] got just come to the lies to save time
[47:52] the last enemy that shall be destroyed
[47:55] is death well death was done away in
[48:00] Jesus Christ
[48:02] it was telling with 2,000 years ago
[48:05] brother though you're still dying you're
[48:09] getting older you want a mirror to pais
[48:13] around when you see them eggs lines that
[48:19] means age you know how you say those
[48:23] thing now watch even though death is
[48:32] destroyed in the new birth death is not
[48:36] destroyed physically are you listening
[48:44] now watch for he has put all things
[48:48] under his feet the word about it it's
[48:50] all under him don't take care of ain't
[48:53] got to be freely you got to wonder
[48:54] whether it works or not I don't know
[48:55] where about it's done
[49:00] but when he sayeth all things are put
[49:04] under him now when God says that it is
[49:12] manifest that he is excepted which did
[49:18] put all things under him now how many of
[49:25] these ever looked that word up I
[49:27] preached on this before so don't worry
[49:30] about it
[49:33] go get Webster's dictionary and find
[49:35] accepting what is accepted mean well it
[49:46] just means you're accepted there's no
[49:51] word accepted that's the only definition
[49:53] you got only first word you got there's
[49:55] no definition of that word and then we
[49:59] went through the scripture come on folks
[50:02] I say it and you don't like it we
[50:05] studied these things in the Baptist
[50:07] Church you didn't read the Bible and
[50:13] study it and look upwards go look up the
[50:18] word accepted you don't believe me
[50:25] somebody won't go run and get wet for
[50:26] dictionary well it just it just means
[50:33] he's accepted but when he says all
[50:39] things are put under him it is manifest
[50:43] it's already done and finished that he
[50:47] is excepted which did put all things
[50:56] under him that means God's accepted come
[51:04] on if you read it gonna sayin
[51:10] we think we're so
[51:12] mark whether I can read except it means
[51:16] accepted I accepted that brother release
[51:21] can be $20 a day and I accepted it well
[51:28] what's that got to do with God in the
[51:30] manifestation you just make it too deep
[51:39] I didn't write the book I'm trying to
[51:48] get you for one time in your life to
[51:49] look at something we've been around here
[51:52] 50 years waiting on something what are
[51:54] you waiting on
[51:58] we know he has been accepted good look
[52:05] up the word that one worse says he has
[52:08] that's a CC EPT he did that's accepted
[52:15] this is e ex CEP TEP why they put that
[52:26] there I don't understand I just
[52:28] understand what it's saying look
[52:39] and when all things shall be subdued
[52:41] unto them then shall the son also
[52:48] himself be subject unto him that put all
[52:55] things under him that God may be all you
[53:01] know human plain old Georgia terminology
[53:09] it looks like he's talking about
[53:12] somewhere there that the sonship is
[53:14] terminated but it doesn't mean
[53:19] terminated like done away with it means
[53:23] something has happened and the only way
[53:27] you can describe it is just to say the
[53:30] son himself becomes subject
[53:47] so when this one up here and his
[53:50] manifest and he's accepted we did put
[54:02] all things under him cross and guard
[54:05] himself something's going to take place
[54:11] now when you're studying this if you'll
[54:13] do it and listen to me it save you a lot
[54:16] of trouble I'll try to do that brother
[54:19] branham explains this scripture in the
[54:24] future I mean in the cross the mystery
[54:27] of God reveal as being in the Millennium
[54:31] the son himself shall become subject
[54:41] then he describes it in the future home
[54:44] I like it when it's quiet you can hear a
[54:51] mouse run across the floor only thing I
[54:54] can hear his brains running sounds rough
[54:57] and somes fine cuz they're older another
[55:00] some fires ago turn very angry I think
[55:04] sometimes you ever lay down in the bed
[55:05] and you turn over one way you know y'all
[55:08] ain't old enough yet don't I look at it
[55:10] brother Lou easy no no dude you don't
[55:12] even know what I'm talkin about
[55:13] you turn one way us old folks and it
[55:15] goes rang in your head you turn over the
[55:19] other way to go yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[55:21] you try to get in the middle to see if
[55:23] you can balance out the to him cogwheels
[55:26] is turning plain old brains i reckons
[55:29] wearing out all right now without the
[55:37] understanding of three sons names we
[55:43] would be in bad shape
[55:45] well rewrite but realize that no matter
[55:48] where we go from your own we still got
[55:50] to line up with our original thought
[55:55] that there's only three sons nuns so
[55:58] whatever is
[56:00] expressed or thought of in this it will
[56:03] still wind up in those three sons now
[56:07] son of man son of God son of David but
[56:15] we found out from the Prophet that he
[56:19] understood the scripture and he didn't
[56:22] inject he told us what it said if you
[56:28] try to study that accepted you'll see
[56:30] what I'm talking about
[56:32] that's not a CCE PTD that's accepted I
[56:37] accepted the $20 brother Louise gave me
[56:40] but that's not what that word means is
[56:46] it manifest that God is or whatever is
[56:50] taking place he has done it so perfectly
[56:53] until within his own self he stands back
[56:56] and looks at it and he says all is well
[57:07] then it's made manifest
[57:11] don't worry about it I got it another
[57:14] message on this one okay at least one
[57:17] more then we'll have questions and
[57:20] answers let you think on it so with the
[57:27] idea now that we've got a a way of doing
[57:32] things we know now how to go from son of
[57:37] man son of God son of David right so we
[57:42] go by the Prophet son of God a son of
[57:45] man son of God
[57:46] injected the son of man to fulfil
[57:49] Malachi 4 I'm quoting brother Branham
[57:52] and it comes out to where you got it man
[57:56] oh god son of man son of David you're
[57:59] not adding anything you just using or
[58:02] utilizing what is the word for you're
[58:04] just using things to bring it to a
[58:08] clarity that's what I said if you keep
[58:12] on studying that word
[58:14] Exe you'll see it'll come to that that
[58:17] you have an understanding of a
[58:20] manifestation what manifestation and
[58:27] guarding the old testament up through
[58:29] the new i'm talking about in the Matthew
[58:31] Mark Luke and John he was son of man
[58:34] right then through the seven churches
[58:38] the son of God
[58:41] uh-huh then in the Millennial which
[58:43] finishes it up under the Jews he'll be
[58:46] the son of David alright so we use the
[58:51] key to get to those things to be able to
[58:54] move from one to the other to wind up
[58:58] and seeing how whatever gets them in the
[59:00] Millennium guess I said the Millennium
[59:03] right which is the plan of redemption
[59:12] now being in that plan of redemption is
[59:15] so important of understanding how you
[59:19] can get there whoa I wasn't my like my
[59:23] brother's hood
[59:23] why didn't matter when I get to heaven
[59:25] they don't matter how get tired it's all
[59:26] I get dark well that's a good point
[59:31] it don't fit too good it was a good boy
[59:34] well he sounds good
[59:36] but it just might be if I'm not
[59:38] concerned how I'll get there angle get
[59:39] to know in my beat is I don't know how
[59:45] to get there if it ain't clear fired up
[59:49] another on how to get that so we were
[59:55] anchored our mind should be settled to
[1:00:00] worry okay we got it to work that you go
[1:00:04] front of man son of God son of man in
[1:00:07] the end time and then son of David okay
[1:00:10] that should be this way you don't have
[1:00:12] to but that ought to be going that way
[1:00:15] it shouldn't be that way I remember one
[1:00:18] of the kids one day and I said something
[1:00:20] you know one of them said something to
[1:00:21] me and I said I said yeah they asked me
[1:00:25] the same question again I said yes
[1:00:27] there's a wait a minute daddy said your
[1:00:30] mouth is saying one thing in your head
[1:00:32] saying something else okay you don't
[1:00:41] never think about what will it be in the
[1:00:43] future all I ask you to read the message
[1:00:45] of your journal you know or listen to
[1:00:50] tight you ain't asking for a raise I am
[1:00:54] I just said I asked you to now if you
[1:01:02] did you would find a lot of key answers
[1:01:04] within that which would be this picture
[1:01:09] used in the future home all right what
[1:01:17] will God be like in the future huh I
[1:01:22] thought that's what bringing this
[1:01:24] morning that the Bible will said that
[1:01:26] even the eternal Godhead could be
[1:01:29] understood by the things that we see
[1:01:31] right we quote that a lot don't we the
[1:01:34] eternal Godhead can be seen by the
[1:01:36] things you know understood by the things
[1:01:37] we see we see it over here we see it
[1:01:39] over here we see it in a baby we see it
[1:01:41] in it we see it in that we sit in Oliver
[1:01:43] a lot of expressing the eternal Godhead
[1:01:47] to understand what mankind has never
[1:01:54] been able to follow even with the
[1:01:56] wording of that because that's mirror
[1:02:00] that's merely a quote to most people I'm
[1:02:06] not throwing up on the body now come on
[1:02:08] get straight you you think that they're
[1:02:11] preaching in the denominations
[1:02:12] there's three sons names and we need to
[1:02:15] get this from need to get down and get
[1:02:16] to that now they figured out none of it
[1:02:18] yeah ain't going off on nobody now let's
[1:02:22] move from that how about moving up in
[1:02:25] this message alright get what we live
[1:02:30] any none of my business what God does
[1:02:32] over there I don't mean that wrong I
[1:02:34] want him to be over there and do what he
[1:02:35] wants to do but he's what I'm what's
[1:02:38] happening here
[1:02:45] try to bring it in the simplicity and
[1:02:48] people say you're too deep that's an
[1:02:50] excuse I don't understand how to rebuild
[1:02:58] a motor that's an excuse so ain't gonna
[1:03:05] tackle it told you about that time
[1:03:07] Richard took that motor apart man he was
[1:03:10] throwing boats every which way and I
[1:03:12] said I'd number every one of them where
[1:03:15] they went and try to put them back where
[1:03:16] they that he sold they'll all go back
[1:03:18] well you know surprising to me you know
[1:03:21] he got the thing back together and you
[1:03:23] it run I know what it would have done if
[1:03:27] I'd have been putting it together gonna
[1:03:30] mean some of them boats was the same
[1:03:31] lips and everything but he said now that
[1:03:33] Boat Diaries he's hot tempered steel
[1:03:34] then it goes here this one here wouldn't
[1:03:38] put it over here okay long as you know
[1:03:41] what you're doing but that's an excuse
[1:03:48] right I had the opportunity to sit down
[1:03:52] there with Richard at that time and say
[1:03:54] I'll explain all these boats no I didn't
[1:03:57] do it I didn't want to I didn't want to
[1:03:59] know it another one go never use it
[1:04:02] right that's an excuse I remember
[1:04:10] brother Hanson's telling one time was it
[1:04:12] brother hands are some pretty sure you
[1:04:15] know somebody told me one time that
[1:04:16] their daddy was I think if it wouldn't
[1:04:18] him if they're dead and their mom and
[1:04:20] him was gone and oh no it's my
[1:04:22] brother-in-law and then even some boys
[1:04:26] decided they needed to just running
[1:04:28] around while daddy mama was gone we come
[1:04:31] find that daddy pulled the motor out of
[1:04:32] the car and tore it apart well they put
[1:04:35] it back together yeah they put it back
[1:04:39] together drove where the woman to go and
[1:04:41] come back took it back apart and tobi
[1:04:42] back in to try but it in that his daddy
[1:04:45] could never get that car to run after
[1:04:47] the hint so maybe that's what we're
[1:04:49] doing okay all right
[1:04:51] everybody ready
[1:04:53] listen do you ever think about heaven
[1:04:59] you ever think about the future home now
[1:05:06] what is God gonna look like I mean the
[1:05:10] basics of organized religion you know
[1:05:13] brother Ernie Villanueva to tell you
[1:05:14] about that and I gets the tickle Danny
[1:05:16] and he says they got it all figured out
[1:05:18] and says you're such the father over
[1:05:20] here and said here's that's the son over
[1:05:23] here or another throw and said here's
[1:05:25] that dove floating around over here
[1:05:27] supposed to be the Holy Ghost and that's
[1:05:30] the Great Trinity of Almighty God yeah
[1:05:38] we laugh at them but what do you think I
[1:05:44] mean a sensible answer is okay with me
[1:05:46] well what do you think God's gonna be
[1:05:49] like in the future huh
[1:05:52] are you gonna take Dave it in the throne
[1:05:55] plop it over the future home you know
[1:06:00] better than that
[1:06:02] you've got enough sense know better than
[1:06:04] that what's it gonna be like I said a
[1:06:13] sensible answer now what a scriptural
[1:06:16] answer the Bible plainly tells you what
[1:06:22] he looked like
[1:06:23] oh it does well
[1:06:38] according to the scripture the God
[1:06:44] according to Philippians and I didn't
[1:06:47] given them okay according to Philippians
[1:06:53] 3 and 21 who shall change our vile body
[1:06:57] that it may be fashioned like unto his
[1:07:01] glorious body according to the working
[1:07:06] whereby he is able to even to subdue all
[1:07:12] things under himself now what's that
[1:07:16] saying what kind of body you gonna have
[1:07:17] a body like his body is that that readin
[1:07:24] hmm well whatever he is we are whatever
[1:07:31] he looks like we look like is that
[1:07:34] sensible when we get in a few of them
[1:07:38] they might get this thing to go tonight
[1:07:39] a while the Prophet on the message Jesus
[1:07:46] at the door
[1:07:46] he's somebody being 20-30 years old and
[1:07:49] all he's taking you in to Pho ship some
[1:07:51] day in the face of of all that has
[1:07:54] criticized you you'll be glorified no
[1:07:58] matters now and made a body like unto
[1:08:02] his own glorious body it is coming
[1:08:09] unless ease who is this are you coming
[1:08:14] down riding on the white horse and we're
[1:08:15] coming Caesar all right from the portals
[1:08:19] of glory to change in fashion this old
[1:08:23] corruptible bodies of ours into a
[1:08:26] glorious body lacking to his own body
[1:08:34] what kind of a body they were what it is
[1:08:39] gonna be like him you get to okay so now
[1:08:45] come on I'm just being serious and ain't
[1:08:48] being silly I guess - is it does he look
[1:08:50] like a monkey
[1:08:56] no you know that's why I like the
[1:09:02] message it doesn't can you know it
[1:09:06] doesn't cut our throats is what we think
[1:09:09] but you know according to brother
[1:09:13] branham he says the closest he can
[1:09:16] understand her of seeing of Christ when
[1:09:20] he was seen him after her in the field
[1:09:22] was like now he just said it exactly
[1:09:24] like it he didn't say that he said like
[1:09:27] unto Jesus at 33 no don't
[1:09:36] he evidently looks human you know I mean
[1:09:41] that and so I don't think he's gonna
[1:09:43] look like that like monkeys
[1:09:47] you know you've been silly okay what is
[1:09:51] it true so we're gonna have a body like
[1:09:54] unto his glorious body his body was made
[1:09:57] eternal in the resurrection right it was
[1:10:00] so much into change but not changing so
[1:10:06] far but Mary didn't under didn't see it
[1:10:09] she seen him and didn't understand who
[1:10:10] that was
[1:10:11] but when he spoke to her he cuz he's
[1:10:15] about 21 years old
[1:10:17] and she knew him is about 33 years old
[1:10:19] looking 50 so but in a minute she said
[1:10:25] Jesus you know know somewhere around 18
[1:10:32] 19 20 years old he's gonna look and
[1:10:33] we're gonna look like they have so
[1:10:38] you're gonna change you know but ain't
[1:10:42] gonna be nobody there were warped up
[1:10:44] bodies and twisted arms and legs missing
[1:10:46] and he's gone and that's an emphasis to
[1:10:51] make some of you probably would use 20
[1:10:54] years old you go home and look in the
[1:10:56] mirror and say oh Lord I hope I don't
[1:10:58] look like that
[1:11:04] right but what is it gonna look like
[1:11:13] whoa okay we got it all figured out God
[1:11:15] is a spirit amen thank God for that
[1:11:20] you'll never change from that he's
[1:11:23] always been a spirit he always will be
[1:11:25] experienced and the spirit can't be
[1:11:27] saying unless the spirit takes a form
[1:11:33] they can't be seen
[1:11:37] so what form is he gonna be in come on
[1:11:44] win the fierce your home sitting in the
[1:11:47] future home with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:50] talking about what he looks like
[1:11:58] just remember you can't do away with any
[1:12:01] manifestation of God don't ever do that
[1:12:03] I don't care what you think about it
[1:12:05] don't ever do away with any
[1:12:07] manifestation you keep adding to I guess
[1:12:10] it's the best way to say it you can
[1:12:13] never take away anything from God
[1:12:16] because he's perfect start with all
[1:12:19] right now
[1:12:30] then what do you expect to see now I
[1:12:36] said you expect to thrown over here and
[1:12:37] I thrown over here and a flutter flutter
[1:12:39] the Dove over here no I don't want that
[1:12:43] no we don't want what do you think well
[1:12:47] I don't really know and really I don't
[1:12:49] think it matters well if he walked in
[1:12:54] here right now what would it matter what
[1:12:58] if he walked in here right now how would
[1:13:02] you know him
[1:13:06] Mary had the connection to the voice
[1:13:09] right but then when she did realize that
[1:13:13] voice that was speaking to her her mind
[1:13:17] could roll back to where he would be 20
[1:13:20] years of age now she can put things
[1:13:25] together one brother Nell I just never
[1:13:29] really thought about guarded as to
[1:13:31] what's it gonna be when we get up to
[1:13:34] heaven one week on base we're gonna
[1:13:35] little spooks we had lunch bucks over
[1:13:37] like floating around in this hour hey
[1:13:39] come on
[1:13:44] brother branham even in the day that he
[1:13:47] was expressing it listen in the days he
[1:13:50] was expressing what it would be like
[1:13:52] before he went beyond the curtain of
[1:13:54] time he did finality give that body
[1:13:57] something read it he would be expressing
[1:14:06] it and he said we couldn't hug brother
[1:14:09] Neville or shake his hand but he would
[1:14:13] bring a finality to a point that things
[1:14:16] could be tangible but you'll never lose
[1:14:25] the scripture saying God is a spirit you
[1:14:30] can't see his spirit it has to have a
[1:14:34] manifestation for you to be able to
[1:14:38] understand anything about a spirit now
[1:14:42] I'm coming up in the message
[1:14:44] - one little spot and then I'm on back
[1:14:46] off deliberately so just follow with me
[1:14:49] up to that point and then we'll back off
[1:14:51] to the next message because I got a lot
[1:14:53] of scriptures to be involved and I want
[1:14:58] your thoughts to be resting upon some
[1:15:00] things until that time so now listen
[1:15:10] after all of these things of God
[1:15:13] revealing himself to man and that was
[1:15:16] the scriptures we had this morning
[1:15:17] that's what the Sun came to do right the
[1:15:20] Sun came to reveal the father see the
[1:15:24] father revealed the Sun through
[1:15:25] manifestation right through healings and
[1:15:28] signs and wonders his voice in fact but
[1:15:31] he made God manifest into what until
[1:15:34] they said Schwarzer father he said
[1:15:37] Philip have I been so long with you
[1:15:39] since have you seen me you've seen the
[1:15:43] father
[1:15:45] well what father look like the son or is
[1:15:51] that it is that plain enough languages
[1:15:56] because jesus knew that was inside of
[1:16:01] him was spirit God and he knew that
[1:16:05] could never be seen by mankind with more
[1:16:08] lies
[1:16:18] what are you gonna have now a body like
[1:16:24] unto his glorious body tell those the
[1:16:29] scriptures for what he does go ahead go
[1:16:37] ahead to number seven let's catch the
[1:16:40] little point we'll go so far quick go up
[1:16:44] to number seven and before he's getting
[1:16:47] there uh I'll tell you where he's
[1:16:51] reading from he's reading from John 14
[1:16:55] all right now he's reading from John 14
[1:16:58] okay
[1:17:00] now cuz that's when he comes to the
[1:17:02] scripture as God was in Christ notice
[1:17:07] now garden making himself no not we're
[1:17:08] not supposed to make converts to
[1:17:10] Christianity by government but by the
[1:17:12] revelation the Christ in u.s. God was in
[1:17:16] Christ as God was in Christ Christ in
[1:17:20] you when that God what that God did in
[1:17:24] Christ Christ does in you what signs did
[1:17:28] God in Christ Christ does in you oh
[1:17:30] isn't that beautiful oh my like that
[1:17:33] Jesus said at that day
[1:17:37] now that's John you know 14:20 at that
[1:17:46] day you shall know that I am in the
[1:17:47] father in me and you and me and I knew
[1:17:52] very well scripture jesus said that that
[1:17:57] day that's this day no III believe
[1:18:03] brother Branham was told let's see where
[1:18:05] that would have been Tom was 63 across
[1:18:10] the mister God reveal I kind of believe
[1:18:12] he was talking about right then don't
[1:18:14] you right now you talking about right
[1:18:17] then okay at that day that's this day at
[1:18:24] that day when this revelation is made
[1:18:26] known Christ is a mystery of God
[1:18:30] revealed
[1:18:32] when it's made known that's today he's
[1:18:35] talking about now when it does and it's
[1:18:38] made known listen to this and you will
[1:18:41] know that I am in the father and the
[1:18:45] father in me okay
[1:18:48] we should understand that because Jesus
[1:18:51] said if you've seen me you've seen the
[1:18:52] father so that should be easy to
[1:18:55] understand that I am in the father and
[1:18:57] the father in me now look I knew that's
[1:19:02] the new birth right come on you got a
[1:19:10] little bit okay that's the new birth I
[1:19:16] in you now that's easy to comprehend
[1:19:20] right but not read the nesting and you
[1:19:22] and me you and me I in you by the new
[1:19:32] birth and you in me you in me somebody
[1:19:43] give me a good definition of that and
[1:19:45] you and me you realize that that day if
[1:19:51] you got the revelation you're gonna find
[1:19:53] out God and man as one and you're gonna
[1:19:56] find out where I gave it to you lean not
[1:19:58] to your understanding I give it if you
[1:19:59] go to weaken got it laying here we're
[1:20:01] brethren said God's not complete without
[1:20:06] you now then we can understand a little
[1:20:12] bit of this you in me because when the
[1:20:18] revelation of that is made manifest at
[1:20:20] that day you'll know that I and the
[1:20:22] father are one
[1:20:24] I am in the father and the father is in
[1:20:28] me
[1:20:29] then when the revelation comes forth
[1:20:31] then it's I in you and you in me now we
[1:20:36] can understand it by Chrysler mister God
[1:20:40] revealed that we're
[1:20:44] our God what we have within us not this
[1:20:48] flesh not these things were but the
[1:20:50] eternal life that is within these bodies
[1:20:54] by the new birth it's a part of God so
[1:21:03] we're getting into something lately
[1:21:07] in other words probable Colossians then
[1:21:13] says this all in me and I'd have how is
[1:21:24] that what do we read it forget it get 2
[1:21:30] Corinthians we'll read it but I want to
[1:21:33] make sure you followed Colossians and it
[1:21:39] comes down to be one time three
[1:21:51] long-suffering women it's in Colossians
[1:21:55] well that's where I'm reading from yeah
[1:22:00] but Christ is all verse 11 and in all
[1:22:08] Christ is all and in all now let's don't
[1:22:16] do is one brother did one time around
[1:22:17] here he gave the cabbage the Holy Ghost
[1:22:19] I never did agree with that tumor that's
[1:22:21] good I didn't like the idea but that was
[1:22:24] his point yeah I don't think everybody's
[1:22:28] got the Holy Ghost I don't think that
[1:22:31] saying Christ is in all you know seven
[1:22:35] billion people in the world they'd all
[1:22:37] of got Christ that's what the scripture
[1:22:39] says oh that he wouldn't say that's what
[1:22:46] you saying it says who is the all in all
[1:22:54] when these days we get on predestination
[1:22:56] where we're chosen in the M right but
[1:23:02] what about it
[1:23:05] now what about a thought
[1:23:10] go ahead to number eight because we're
[1:23:13] not gonna have time to go way over we'll
[1:23:15] just go so far cut it and God
[1:23:23] at that day which is what day now this
[1:23:26] day the day of this revelation right
[1:23:30] from across the mister God revealed okay
[1:23:34] and God it that day the kingdom be given
[1:23:38] over to the Father now remember Jesus in
[1:23:43] the church ages and what we've been
[1:23:45] through that you'll sit with me and my
[1:23:47] throne as I have overcome and set with
[1:23:49] my father in his strong now he overcame
[1:23:53] and sit with the father in his throne
[1:23:54] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[1:23:56] right are we right now
[1:23:59] uh-huh-huh-huh the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:02] Ghost made that right all right now then
[1:24:07] we're to come down to the church ages
[1:24:08] and sit with him in his throne as he
[1:24:10] could which his throne is the Millennium
[1:24:12] right the throne of Jesus is the
[1:24:16] Millennium that's what your prophet said
[1:24:22] all right you will not do that brother
[1:24:26] thing I mean I know it but it makes you
[1:24:29] think I always told you a good speaker
[1:24:34] is one that can get you to think so if I
[1:24:38] got a slap you with it now slap you let
[1:24:40] it get you think now watch what he's
[1:24:43] saying some worse
[1:24:45] something's going to take place and God
[1:24:49] if that day the kingdom be given over to
[1:24:53] the father okay
[1:24:58] he might be all in all
[1:25:03] well he's yet speaking out here or David
[1:25:06] Christ see that's what I'm saying Christ
[1:25:07] the mystery he's uses his scripture as a
[1:25:09] millennium future home he uses it the
[1:25:14] future home this scripture its compound
[1:25:16] meaning because it's got to be Tod that
[1:25:18] we go we got to get that man in the
[1:25:21] Millenium sitting on the throne and then
[1:25:23] be able to get him off that throne and
[1:25:26] move over into the future home we can't
[1:25:32] leave him sitting on the throne come on
[1:25:38] when he's yet speaking out here David
[1:25:41] Christ David sitting on the throne the
[1:25:43] king over the whole human race and while
[1:25:46] they're yet thinking I'll know what
[1:25:47] they're thinking about before they speak
[1:25:50] I'll answer them okay go ahead a number
[1:25:57] no which is taken from the future home
[1:26:02] now we're gonna use this scripture
[1:26:06] Andy's descended upon the throne in that
[1:26:09] perfect kingdoms when time the kingdom
[1:26:15] that Jesus is to surrender to the Father
[1:26:21] Laurita the kingdom that Jesus is to
[1:26:25] surrender to the father that God might
[1:26:28] be all and in all that's not just all
[1:26:38] and all that's all and in all read it
[1:26:41] cuz that's what the scripture says not
[1:26:43] in the Colossians Corinthians then he
[1:26:46] might be all and in all
[1:26:48] Jesus sets upon his throne here as our
[1:26:51] Joseph and the king is the light that
[1:26:54] will be on top of the Mount Zion not to
[1:26:57] millennium future home and his holy
[1:27:02] light will flood into our city
[1:27:05] hallelujah we're gonna get to in the
[1:27:07] next message that there ain't no light
[1:27:09] in the future home
[1:27:11] the lamb and God is the light that's
[1:27:15] what the Bible says you don't need no
[1:27:18] light bubs
[1:27:23] well you can go on down on 449 where
[1:27:27] veterans explain into paradise and lots

[1:27:37] Millennium the new earth coming on down
[1:27:41] no just a second
[1:27:47] what's gonna happen let's see what's
[1:27:56] gonna happen one day so now we've got to
[1:27:59] the future home and we got to father
[1:28:04] which is the Holy Spirit or the Spirit
[1:28:07] of God and God is a spirit and they that
[1:28:09] it were and that'll never be done away
[1:28:11] with but now we've got the son into the
[1:28:22] future home
[1:28:30] go ahead a number 11 on top of my design
[1:28:38] will set the lamp and the city will need
[1:28:40] no light for the lamb is the light
[1:28:42] thereof and above the lamb will be the
[1:28:45] father which is the low gosh
[1:28:48] now there's Yuki if you'll just read it
[1:28:54] there's the lamb who's the lamb come on
[1:29:01] somebody answer who's the lamb Jesus is
[1:29:03] the lamb so Jesus is going to be there
[1:29:08] but something's got to happen
[1:29:15] well the lamb is a lot thereof and above
[1:29:18] the lamb will be the father when you're
[1:29:21] Trinitarian we thought we had this thing
[1:29:23] figured out we finally got it down to
[1:29:25] tunas and you got it down to oh you just
[1:29:27] messing my mind up he messing your mind
[1:29:30] up he's already messed up
[1:29:31] get it straight God the great lot the
[1:29:41] eternal light that assigned just above
[1:29:43] the throne and Jesus will not be on his
[1:29:48] Father's throne he'll be on his throne
[1:29:56] now we've moved from the son of David to
[1:30:00] the future home not as son of David but
[1:30:04] we've retained his throne listen don't
[1:30:10] do away with the throne don't do away
[1:30:11] with anything
[1:30:12] just bring it and bring it into place
[1:30:14] look and the father will hover over the
[1:30:18] son you just messing me up for this I
[1:30:25] your prophet is go fast with him about
[1:30:29] it and the father will hover over the
[1:30:35] son which the father and son will be one
[1:30:41] come on
[1:30:42] here's the Sun the lamb the son the
[1:30:49] father just hovers over him look over
[1:30:55] there brother Aaron was preaching about
[1:30:56] the the happening there was when God
[1:31:00] created the angels and thing said what
[1:31:02] was it just took a little dust and
[1:31:03] flunked it out and I went a body and the
[1:31:09] father will hover over the son which the
[1:31:12] father and the son will be one and while
[1:31:15] they're yet speaking I'll answer before
[1:31:18] they can think I'm thinking for them now
[1:31:22] that's what we need and Jesus will will
[1:31:26] commit a perfect perfect age to the
[1:31:31] perfect Living God that he has redeemed
[1:31:34] and give over to the father is that
[1:31:42] right we'll turn to God the Father which
[1:31:45] is spirit not a man spirit all nature of
[1:31:50] goodness is gathered together that's God
[1:31:52] and in goodness now anything perverted
[1:31:56] from good is evil
[1:31:57] that Satan's Kingdom a perfect Kingdom
[1:32:09] now go back to Corinthians and let's
[1:32:11] read there see if that's what it says
[1:32:15] okay bring it up Corinthians we'll start
[1:32:24] about verse 26 try to save time the last
[1:32:28] enemy that shall be destroyed is death
[1:32:31] death is not destroyed for everybody
[1:32:35] until the lake of fire which is after
[1:32:40] the Millenium and the white throne is
[1:32:45] after the Millennium the white throne is
[1:32:48] just prior to the future home
[1:32:51] there's where death will be finally
[1:32:54] totally annihilated go to remember
[1:33:00] there's another scripture there is
[1:33:01] talking about if we don't see everything
[1:33:03] clearly but said we see Jesus we see
[1:33:06] just enough to get us down that's plain
[1:33:09] as I can say it the life's to enemy that
[1:33:11] shall be destroyed his death where he
[1:33:13] has put all things under his feet though
[1:33:16] when he says all things are put under
[1:33:18] his feet it is manifest that he is
[1:33:21] there's that little word accepted well
[1:33:25] it means he's accepted why is it not
[1:33:27] still they see CPTED come on you'll
[1:33:32] never find that words will go F yourself
[1:33:34] we should put all things under him
[1:33:37] now look and when all things shall be
[1:33:39] subdued unto Him who god then shall the
[1:33:45] son also himself be subject unto him
[1:33:49] that put all things under him that God
[1:33:52] may be all you know they will say the
[1:33:59] major of that next message something's
[1:34:04] gonna happen in a future home I just
[1:34:06] read you where the Prophet said the lamb
[1:34:08] will be their God I just hover over that
[1:34:12] lamb and God will be one what were you
[1:34:15] seeing in the future home I've always
[1:34:17] thought this if
[1:34:21] Jesus is right when he said if you've
[1:34:23] seen me you've seen the father if that's
[1:34:28] right see then what do you expect to see
[1:34:31] in the future home or the millennium or
[1:34:34] anywhere I expect to see Jesus but I'll
[1:34:40] realize Jesus is Almighty God I realized
[1:34:47] what he kept trying to say if you've
[1:34:49] seen me you've seen the father
[1:34:51] cuz I'm my father one he kept trying to
[1:34:56] describe that read Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:34:58] John
[1:35:00] he kept trying to declare who he was and
[1:35:03] a kingdom a kingdom that would come to
[1:35:07] the right place
[1:35:10] see when he relinquishes are all things
[1:35:13] he becomes subject himself and when he
[1:35:17] becomes subject itself he just simply
[1:35:21] sets her and the father just hovers over
[1:35:26] the son when you look you'll see Jesus
[1:35:33] but you'll know who he is there's one
[1:35:38] God not one guarding our thoughts and
[1:35:43] ideas just one guard when you can come
[1:35:46] to the end of all of it with one he was
[1:35:48] one in the beginning is to be one in the
[1:35:50] end don't lose any manifestation he had
[1:35:56] in the middle or anywheres else John
[1:36:01] could stand there and look at him
[1:36:03] sitting there in the Millenium he could
[1:36:05] say there's the Lamb of God that takes
[1:36:08] away the sin of the world well what
[1:36:10] could he see when he's standing in the
[1:36:12] future home whatever thing is eternal
[1:36:16] and he's got an eternal revelation in
[1:36:19] his heart and he said there's the Lamb
[1:36:20] of God
[1:36:24] there's the Lamb of God
[1:36:27] he said well what do you think you're
[1:36:29] going to see I'm gonna see Jesus
[1:36:31] now listen the reason I'm gonna know it
[1:36:35] is cuz I'm gonna have a body like unto
[1:36:36] his glorious body you shook your head
[1:36:38] this away while ago I'm gonna have a
[1:36:43] body like unto his glorious body hey if
[1:36:52] he's sitting there and the father hovers
[1:36:54] over it
[1:36:56] what's the matter we're thinking wit
[1:36:59] you'll be sitting there and the father
[1:37:02] can hover over you and say this is my
[1:37:07] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[1:37:12] let's feel Bible you know what do you
[1:37:14] like it or not come on come on musicians
[1:37:18] think on these things I've still got a
[1:37:20] lot of scripture to be covered because
[1:37:26] it'll cover and show exactly what we're
[1:37:27] talking about that's not trinitarianism
[1:37:31] and it's certainly not one that's cuz
[1:37:33] you'll never do away see where the one
[1:37:36] this would be wrong the oneness would do
[1:37:38] away with everything one that will one I
[1:37:40] said that in the whole message today
[1:37:43] because it ain't gonna do away it's
[1:37:46] going to in to enhance or magnify the
[1:37:49] fact that God is going to hover over and
[1:37:54] when you see it you'll see Jesus but
[1:37:57] you'll know who he is
[1:37:59] you'll know then that I and my father
[1:38:01] are one
[1:38:05] what about it Mustang that God
[1:38:11] maybe all this is the next message and
[1:38:17] in all because we can't come out in the
[1:38:23] same position same place in same part
[1:38:25] with the message then we've missed it
[1:38:28] this is not an adding true this is
[1:38:31] expressing the Word of God well brother

[1:39:01] that it says at that day well they're so
[1:39:04] smart but so idiotic lead um do not

[1:43:51] end our see that's why when brother
[1:43:56] branham got to the future home if you're
[1:43:57] listening to it they asked him said you
[1:44:03] got anything he said you're putting
[1:44:04] something else onto another day
[1:44:07] he said you're a topologist you got a
[1:44:10] house scripture see that's as far as
[1:44:14] they could see now come on they could
[1:44:16] read the Bible and they read of those
[1:44:18] things and they read of those eight days
[1:44:21] and all this that the other they studied
[1:44:23] those thing but the mind of mankind was
[1:44:27] locked as far as he could go
[1:44:29] was the millennial reign no one ever
[1:44:35] talked to a future home he said I ain't
[1:44:39] run out of tops he said I got one more
[1:44:43] he took it right on over and went into
[1:44:46] that 8th day and went straight across
[1:44:47] with it I've asked you to just read
[1:44:50] after seeing that 8th day all things
[1:44:54] will be made new to be made eternal a
[1:44:59] wonderful place for me I'm enjoying
[1:45:02] while I'm here don't know about you but
[1:45:06] I do I'll give you a little key that
[1:45:09] I've tried for explain for a long time
[1:45:14] it's very serious to me and I've always
[1:45:17] been that way any of you remember me
[1:45:22] trying to explain this when you see a
[1:45:25] revelation of something when God is
[1:45:28] revealing something to you and you're
[1:45:30] sitting there in that pew and you see
[1:45:32] what's being said
[1:45:34] just raise your hands and say I claim my
[1:45:39] family I claim my children I claim my
[1:45:44] husband my wife by the brothers and
[1:45:47] sisters just right while that's being
[1:45:49] revealed to you that's being made known
[1:45:53] why because you're in a heavenly
[1:45:57] atmosphere of when it's being revealed
[1:46:03] it's easy to receive your healing God
[1:46:07] wakes you up in the middle of the night
[1:46:09] starts speaking to you about some
[1:46:10] showing you think just say thank you
[1:46:12] lord thank you for my family
[1:46:14] thank you for my husband my children
[1:46:16] with her thank you lord
[1:46:19] you ain't gonna stop him from revealing
[1:46:22] it to you it's just something I learned
[1:46:25] a long time ago a little key to being
[1:46:29] able to accept from God it's number one
[1:46:33] recognize God is present knowing that
[1:46:37] he's revealing it to him he gotta be
[1:46:38] present if he's present then I can ask
[1:46:42] anything right try it sometime father we
